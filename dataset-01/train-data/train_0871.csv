2,I love Sailor Moon but I think this would be better if ?,They would produce a dubbed and editted version of Sailor Moon R on DVD. My concerns are the themes of that were removed from dubbed Movie. I'm very disturbed by the themes in the Japanese version of Sailor Moon on the DVD. The themes aren't editted on the DVD as I would hope!
5,Cool...(soundtrack not included),"This movie is, I have to agree with the majority, the best of all the Sailor Moon movies. The graphics are amzing and this is just a sensational piece of artwork. It would be even better if there was a soundtrack to this...(i.e. the scene when the asteroid is toted away by Princess Serenity and the gang, put ""The Rockafeller Skank"" by Fatboy Slim...)"
1,Gag me with my subtitled Sailor Moon S video!,"I have one question; Why! It is bad enough that DiC had to RUIN Sailormoon by dubbing the first two seasons(which they did very poorly, in my honest opinion), but did Pioneer have to ruin the Sailormoon R movie, too? Why must they distroy a wonderful anime by 'censoring' it for little 8-year-old kids? Why not just put a 'For 13 and Up' sticker on the box like they did for the subtitled version? I can only pray that they do not dub the other movies and/or seasons. Sure, it would be nice to see the Sailormoon S, Sailormoon SuperS, and Sailormoon Stars seasons get subtitled. But, watching the dubbed versions? Sorry, not happening."
2,Fiore vs. Sailor Moon,"in R Movie no one at all does love Sailor Moon to Fiore but he very evil to destroy her,in R Fiore Kindap and capture her to the final in the movie but he hug her, maybe he does like to fell in love and kiss to Sailor Moon. if Fiore want to Destroy Sailor Moon in Japanese or America, I like Japanese the one Fiore grad her to been Capture or Kindap to Sailor Moon,and I like the America than as Japanese, but Fiore want to Capture or Kindap to Sailor Moon, but Fiore Does love and kiss her after all."
2,Video,"Well, lets see... I have not seen this before but I know how this movie goes. This big flower can't do anything himself so... he hypnotizes people to do dirty work. I heard rumors that Rini isn't in this episode so... that's why the stars are so... low. I don't know what the Geneon Signature Series are."
5,SO KEWL,THIS MOVIE WAS THE BEST! MOON REVENGE IS THE KEWLEST SONG! EVERYTING IS SOOO KAWAII! I`VE ONLY SEEN THE R AND SS MOVIES AND R IS DEFINITELY WAAAY BETTER! USAGI (SERENA) TURNS INTO THE MOON PRINCESS AND THERE`S SOME ROMANCE! MUST SEE AND MUST GET MOVIE!
5,"Great combination of characterization, action, and animation","This movies had pretty good animation. The story was good, also. There was a good mix of characterization and action. The Japanese voices are much better, and the original songs and score are great (although, IMO, ""Moonlight Revenge"" is ok). Still, a good movie for Sailor Moon fans and non-fans."
5,Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon does it again!,"This movie is great, it is funny and romantic. All the sailor senshi use there old and new powers. It is also great to finally here the real voices of the sailor senshi. Also buy this tape to help promote Sailor Moon, and bring over the other episodes. If the sales go great then the other episodes will come over as well! So if you are a true Sailor Moon fan then you must buy this tape along with the other two to help support our sailors!"
5,Great,To me this is probably the best sailormoon movie. It has action and a grest plot. The fighting scenes are great (but maybe too violent for little kids). The Enemies are cool but not as cool as the snow dancers on the S movie.... though the S movie has a weak plot. If you want to see the outer senshi you should get the S movie. I reccomend (is that spelled right) this movie out of the three. It is by far the best.... unless your one of those outers or chibi moon fans......... ok sorry that was short...... that pretty much sums it up (without giving away spoilers)........ ok i bet i had a lot of spelling errors............nevermind....
1,Terrible quality not worth ANYONE'S time!,"This was a great TV show but the transfer is just about as bad as can be. It is completely frustrating trying to watch this show via this 2 disc DVD set. If you are a fan of this show, try the other versions...this one, is not worth your time or money."
3,Orange Razr Case,"I had to trim the case for the charger to stay attached...the reason for the three stars. Otherwise it is a durable, well fitted case."
2,"Action, Camera, UGH","I went on line to get a DVD on one of his concerts, and this had the best reviews and price--forget the concert--buy popcorn and watch this movie instead which is what it really is. And--a really ""C"" movie at that. He is still a great singer in my book, but ""Julio"", thanks for staying a singer. Would I ask someone else to purchase this??? No, and I do not have any enemies to pay back by asking them to buy it."
4,Another Chance,"This was a very good book. The stories were enjoyable and although each was too short for me, they managed to show that no matter the length of time, if you are meant to be together, it will happen. Great stories, ladies."
1,Could have been better,The stories especially Mrs Kitt lack feeling the woman was so withdrawn that when she and Carter got together i was confused as to how that took place.
4,Never Have Such Great Tracks Been Wasted on Such Average MCs,"The tracks are classic mid 90's material, maybe some of the best Pete Rock tracks ever. It's just a shame that the MCs can't match the same level of greatness. Not to say that they're awful, but Pete Rock is a genius and needs a lyricist to match.That being said, if you like mid-late 90's hip hop and Pete Rock production, get this immediately."
4,Lost & Found- Listen to this double CD carefully!,"Yes, Deda's side isn't as good as the Ini side, but if you are a BIG Pete Rock fan like me, it is well worth your money! Period! The production can't get any better than this, it is truely for those nights cruisin in your car or just chillin' at your house. IF YOU ARE AN ASPIRING HIP HOP PRODUCER, BUY THIS CD AND LEARN FROM THE BEST!"
5,The Heart and Soul Behind the Eyes and Smile,"In my opinion the Fox News Channel has the most engaging and attractive newswomen of all the cable news outlets: Dari Alexander, Julie Banderas, Laurie Dhue - even Rudi Bakhtiar, one of the more popular anchors at CNN, is now on Fox. But for me the best of them all is former A Current Affair correspondent Harris Faulkner. She has a quality of elegance and poise that is rare to find in today's broadcast journalism. And those eyes and smile are simply beautiful!Until recently I was unaware that Harris Faulkner was a victim of a stalker. This book tells the story of a smart, gutsy and beautiful woman. Harris, a speechwriter and motivational speaker in addition to being a journalist, proves that one doesn't need to abandon one's values for ambition."
5,Hard to put down,This book is a must read. It isn't preachy like the title made it sound. It is a very chilling account of how one woman lived through being stalked. This is the first book I've read in years and read it from cover to cover in one evening.
4,More than worth the money,Harris is a great American success story and this is a book that ought to be read by youngsters looking for a model and oldsters that want to be uplifted. The used price was way less than the value of the book.
5,Wonderful book,"Harris Faulkner is a very brave woman, in addition to being a great reporter. She demonstrates how faith in God can help you through the hardest of times"
1,Don't get it,This book is very preachy. The woman is self absorbed and only looking to make a name for herself.Boring
5,Artax,"I was very surprised on how good of an album this was. I listen to 311, MxPx, Green Day, and Rage Against the Machine and I totally love this CD. When ever I need to calm down and relax and get away from the world I listen to it. I recomend this CD to anyone who likes any music genre."
5,This guy does it all!,"Tony Rich is a wonderful all-round artist. This entire album was produced, written, arranged and performed by him with only a small amount of help on a few songs by additional musicians. And every song is so good even though the album only spawned one major hit, ""Nobody knows"". The other songs were for the most part, overlooked, and it is a shame, because there's not one filler in the entire album. The 16 page booklet includes numerous photos and all the lyrics. This really is a wonderful album, and highly recommended. If you are a fan of Brian McKnight then you will for sure love Tony Rich too."
3,Expected more,"Being rated for -20, I expected it to last much longer before losing its ability to retain heat. I rarely stored this in the stuff sack because that's usually how you kill a sleeping bag in the first place, but this bag worked great the first few times, then gradually lost its ability to keep me warm. Even in moderately cool night temperatures. This bag is way too heavy to use for backpacking and we never used it that way. We used it mostly for camping trips or while at Scout camp.I don't use this bag any more and now use a heavy duty rectangular bag with my 3-inch foam pad and aluminum cot."
3,A Little large,My Daughter is 5' tall so as you can imagain she has a great built in pillow when she rolls the top down so her feet reach the bottom. She says it's the warmest bag she has ever had.
5,"An ""Enchanting"" Selection from Stevie Nicks","Stevie Nicks, legendary chanteuse of Fleetwood Mac, has dazzled us once again with this three CD boxed set celebrating her amazing twenty year career. Disc one contains hits from her first few albums, including ""Stop Draggin' My Heart Around,"" her smash 1981 duet with Tom Petty, and the masterful, majestic ballad ""Beauty and the Beast."" Disc two includes songs from her later solo efforts, such as ""Rooms on Fire,"" and ""Has Anyone Ever Written Anything for you."" Of course, any true Stevie fan would go right to disc three, which contains unreleased gems like the moving ""Sleeping Angel,"" and an amazing live version of concert favorite ""Gold and Braid."" ""Enchanted"" is a must-have for Stevie Nicks lovers-- I've owned it for a year and still haven't tired of it!"
3,A greatest hits collection that misses the target,"Yep, you got all the hits here along with B-sides, songs from soundtracks, and a horrible piano version of ""Rhiannon"". What's missing is insight. Instead we're asked to look through a scrapbook, and not a journal. How much fun can that be? I recommend ""TimeSpace: The Best of Stevie Nicks"" for the Cliffs Notes version of this tedious and ultimately dissapointing box set. Narcissism comes with Stevie's territory and ""Enchanted"" is no exception."
5,enchanted,"This box-set goes beyond the traditional ""best of"" albums. From the unheard flip side of 45's to her sound track cuts, Stevie shares more of herself through songs you would have missed if you never had a turn table. Of course, the ultimate collection is to have all of the albums Stevie has put out. There were several songs from her Rock a Little and Street Angel albums that I found moving, that were not included. I also feel one of her better duets, Smiling Islands, should have been included. I cant find that song anywhere. With her enchanted voice and style, Stevie takes you through her life and touches your soul. She shares the best and gives written insight in what is behind many of the songs. Her story is well worth listening too."
5,"Stevie Nicks is truly ""Enchanted""`",This is a dream set for those of us out there who have been ensnared by the unique voice of Stevie Nicks these past 25+ years. Wonderful set! Luv ya Stevie!
5,Great Collection,"Stevie Nicks has a great voice! I always like her songs: Stand Back, Talk To Me, and Edge Of Seventeen! As a box set, this collection was done right. Lots of hits, rarities, and rare pictures. Unlike some box sets, there are lyrics to all the songs. For the hardcore fan, you should buy this even if you already have her music on CD!"
4,Not enough,"Stevie Nicks' career is made up of fairy tales and dreams and happy endings in the long run. Unfortunately, Nicks didn't make all her fans happy with this set. True followers of her will have notice lots of songs were left off that was expected to be on here, such as ""Real Tears"" and ""Mirror Mirror."" Also, what about ""God's Garden,"" for those not lucky enough to get the Japan version of ""Street Angel."" Not that this isn't a bad collection, it's just that songs that were put in here, such as regular album cuts, should've been omitted for more obscured tracks."
4,A great Box Set that fans will be sure to make a hit.,"Enchanted is the collection of Stevie Nicks' favorite cuts off of her majour albums released from 1981-1994, but it also features rare b-sides, demo songs, and a newly remastered version of the classic Buckingham/Nicks ""Long Distance Winner."" This album showcases Stevie in her fullest glory. It becomes apparent that the mere sequencing of these tracks took Nicks months, as the songs calmly flow from emotion to emotion and track to track with grace and ease. Included with the three disc set is a 63 page booklet full of photos of Nicks by herself, with friends (Tom Petty, Jimmy Iovine, etc.), and additional rare photographs. Also, lyrics for all of the songs on throught the three discs is at the back of the booklet. Verdict: One would be hard-pressed to find a better 3 1/2 hours of music anywhere else. Ever. However, its lack of commercial and commonly recognizable songs would make casual fans stray from this set."
5,A fantastic compilation of her work from past to present.,"I have been a fan of Stevie Nicks' work for years and this boxed cd collection is a must for anyone who has enjoyed her music. I thought I had all of her work, but there are songs that I had not heard that have been put on this boxed set. I am thrilled to have been able to add this to my collection of her music."
5,For the big fan,"I've always liked Stevie's songwriting and her performances. This set gives you just about everything she has done in her solo career. There's nothing deep here but the melodies are all great.If you're an obsessive fan then you have to have this set. A casual fan will do fine with 'Timespace', a single disc of her greatest hits."
4,Very nice for the price,"Opened the box pluged it in to my system, installed the software and we were off and running. Recognized my Plextor CDRW no problems. Tried some old 4x imation CDR and they bunred without a hitch. The only reason I did not give it five stars, it's a little slower than I expected, but then again I don,t have a top of the line system. I would recomend this drive."
4,A Solid Instructional Video,"This video is a wonderful follow-up to the first in the series. Mara explains moves in a way that anyone can understand. By breaking down the moves first BEFORE setting them to music, you can really understand what you are supposed to do. That makes it easier to do the beautiful free-flowing dances she presents. The production is straight-forward, without distracting camera angles and flash-pots, which make you focus on the point of this video - learning how to belly dance. I look forward to many more in this series!"
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"After having purchased other very high quality Belly Dance instructional videos, it was with much anticipation that I awaited the receipt of this one. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. Not only was the production quality extremely poor (it was worse than a home video - just one big blownout light from the front) but it appeared to me that this tape was thrown together in an hour. It was also a very short tape in which the entire instructional portion was performed WITHOUT MUSIC?! (Perhaps her boom box ""play"" key was stuck?) I do not understand how you can teach someone to ""dance"" without music. Especially ME dance as an understanding of the rhythms is key to the movement. I found this video of extremely poor quality, which was immediately evidenced upon glancing at the out-of-focus photographs on the video box. (Not in a ""special effect"" way, either). Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Not His Best Work,"Fans of the Vaselines and Eugenius must have been excited to see this come out a few years back. But the mood might have dampened a bit when they started hearing the record. This is not BAD music by any stretch, but it's just not prime Eugene Kelly. He still shows a great wit here, and once in a while hits a nice melody line, but overall the material falls flat. Not enough hooks, not enough memorable lyrics, not much of a sense of a gifted songwriter and performer on a roll. No, better stick with The Way of the Vaselines and Oomalama and hope for a return to form at some other time."
4,Calming!,"Very peaceful and calming.......a real relaxation tape. No annoying commentary or music, just the ""real thing"" and you truly can pretend to be on the beach!"
3,"Statler brothers, statlers karaoke",Music is OK.Guess I preferred to hear the Statlers singing to their music. They could have sung their songs acapella and that would have been fine with me.
4,The style in which this book is written makes it delightful,Mrs. Emery has done a wonderful job of bringing practical advise in an entertaining style. It many ways it feels like reading letters from a good friend. The information is general for the most part but detailed enough to be very usable.
4,My bible of family survival techniques,"I first read Carla's book in the 70's when I married a part-time farmer. She helped this city girl learn how to manage a large garden, livestock, preserving, milking,and storing the surplus. Her humorous anecdotes about family also helped while raising my children. I recently purchased a new book for myself and my nephew. He had returned from a 2 year stint in the peacecorp in Africa and had an interest in living a more basic life back home. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in getting back, not to a simple life, but to a meaningful, full life!"
5,A book that will be around for a long time to come....,"Writing a review of this book seems tobe waste considering all the praise that has already been lavished on it, but I just wanted to add my two cents worth. The book is everything it saids it is, an encyclopedia of a simpler lifestyle.. (NOTE: A country/rural lifestyle is simple, it is NOT easy! ) Almost all aspects of country living are covered here with short ""fun"" quizes to test yourself interspersed here and there. An added bonus is that Ms. Emery ""forgets"" she is writing a ""how-to"" book and gives the reader some really beautiful writing. This is a book that truly offers something for almost everyone....."
5,The old 1975 version is priceless!,"When I first saw this wierd-looking rainbow-colored 1975 ""Old Fashioned Recipe Book"" in 1978, I fell in love with it. I traded a bolt of white bridal satin for it, and have never regretted that trade! Of course the binding fell apart, but a 3-ring notebook holds it now. I think it was printed on a hand-crank mimeograph drum on stiff colored craft paper. Carla's book has been my companion for 21 years now, and I still find things in it that I didn't see before. She wrote about real life, and real family love. The recipies are secondary. I'd like to see the new version, but the original is priceless. Of the dozens of 'cook books' I own, this is the one I return to most often for basic information. Thank you, Carla."
5,The most complete book for countryfolk ever published,"If you have ever wanted to get back to nature and live ina self-sufficient environment, this encyclopedia is a must!Carla Emery has grown up living off the land and explainshow to do everything from growing your own food andbutchering your own animals to birthing babies at home.It is chock full of delightful recipes and antecdotes. Onceyou read her book, you will feel a part of Ms. Emery'slife and literary success"
5,outstanding book for all,"I love this book a cookbook a country living book of all the things you wished you knew. humor, daily living, and an easy book for your everyday living in a rural setting.. I would never want to be without this book and advise anyone raising kids, creatures, or just plain living to get this book and enjoy. although listed as worn, it was in almost perfect condition, only a page bent up on one corner...and the price was so low compared to a new book.."
4,Buy It!,"Though there are disparaging reviews about this book, and I can understand their positions, I cannot agree with them. The knowledge in this book is extremely thorough and the slow presentation of information makes it more likely to be remembered when needed than from such books as Back to Basics or Storey's Basic Country Skills. I find that this retention is a great thing so that you do not always have to keep referenceing the book or kicking yourself when you go to buy your first sheep and cannot remember what you are supposed to look for.I also love the recipes. They are concise, easy to follow, and several are presented on any given page."
5,Country life,"Great information for anyone wanting to get back to the basics, Carla has mastered the country life, mixed with family, experience and farmlife passion."
2,good gift,"I bought this for myself, but would not do again. A much to large tome, very confusing at times and boring. Maybe for a serious farmer it MIGHT be interesting, but for the average consumer it is to dry and boring. I find myself using it as a reference on a rare occasion for some recipe related item, but mostly collecting dust. Might be donated to the local public book source soon, not worth the shelf space in my opinion. Spend your precious cash elsewhere."
1,My ninth grader could write a better book.,"The author takes up way too much space in this book, and there's way too much fluff. This must be her first book"
5,This is the One,Buy this! An amazing collection of information on most everything you need to know about country living. The one REAL homesteaders use.
4,"Looks great, but get the glue.","This was one of the more interesting dragons from the 5th series, but it's also one of the more frustrating ones to assemble because of the way it is put together.In the picture, you'll see that the human figures are holding chains that connect to the bottom of the collar around the dragon's neck. The point where all the chains meet is actually a seperate piece that has to be popped into a socket in the bottom of the dragon's neck to make it look like a seamless collar. When I tried to do this, I found that the chains weren't long enough and I had to bend the dragon into an unnatural position to get the piece into the hole. Of course, any slight movement after this made the collar piece pop out and I eventually glued the thing in.I like this figure overall, but I just wish they'd made the chains longer."
3,Good for display item but not really a toy...,"I really don't think that this can really be played with as there is not much articulation, but it makes a pretty nice display peice."
5,10 Hours of Classic Episodes!,"This series consists of 7 tapes, featuring 10 hours of complete unedited shows from the Golden Age of Television. Included are: The Jack Benny Show, Texaco Star Theater, The $64,000 Question, I Married Joan, This Is Your Life, Sid Caesar, The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show, Groucho Marx, Alan Young, Stage Show with Elvis Presley's debut, and many more shows from the 1950's. The shows are in black & white. This is a good opporunity to revisit many of the great series of the past."
3,"good for some more advanced students, but even then...","The first part of the book explains some power yoga basics (quite scientific), the main part gides you through the different poses.Each pose is displayed on 2 pages - one big photo on the left side and the series of small photos on the right side with a very brief explanation. Photos are black and white.What I really miss in the book are a different variations for the poses! What to do when you have certain problem - how to make the pose easier...and when you are advanced - how to make it more dificult, or just have some variations in your training - this information is simply missing and therefore only 3 stars!"
2,Dynamic Yoga,"Was not crazy about this book, in the introduction the author writes how dynamic yoga is a great fitness program, kind of takes away from the whole body and mind aspect of yoga, eventhough he states that it is for everyone."
2,Why do we need sequels?,"When reading the first book in this series I was pleasantly surprised. Very nice and original plot. A five star book in my opinion. The best part being that it was a book by itself, no sequels, everything was perfectly finished, no open ending, the villain(s) were dead or beaten. Recently I found out that there were sequels to this book. I decided to buy the second book, and immediateley after I started reading it I got a little bit disappointed. The plot is so extremely obvious that while reading the book you are wondering on what page Ben will find the truth of the matter. The reader knows this from almost page one. Nightshade (supposed to be dead in the fairy world with the ending of book one) miraculously re-appears. In short, not at all what I expected after reading part one."
5,Read this one too,If you want a light hearted fun book to read then you have to try this. Terry Brooks spins a great tale.
1,"Leftovers, anyone?","I was excited to get a hardback edition of this sequel to Kingdom for Sale as I enjoyed exploring this new land with its new king.The problem is that I'd been to this land already and Brooks didn't show me any new places nor anything about his land that I didn't already know.It was a fairly hackneyed plot placed in the setting of what had once been novel.It didn't freshen the plot, it killed my nostalgia for the setting.This is the only book I have ever destroyed because I did not want anyone to waste their precious leisure time reading it.It is a thoroughly mediocre tale that ruins the enjoyment of the first book.Try a different author or series."
1,kindle version full of typos,the publisher needs to proofread the kindle version of this book. it looks like it was written on a newton.
2,"Good book, terrible Kindle version.","The book itself is wonderful. However, the Kindle version is clearly an unedited OCR scan of a paper copy - it often reads a capital I as a 1, a double lower case L as an N, adds/misses spaces, etc. A simple spell check would have caught the problems, and some minor effort would have fixed them. As is, the errors make reading the Kindle version of this book an exercise in irritation. Not the quality of product I would expect from Amazon on something targeted at one of their flagship products."
5,super book!,"If you do any Python development, this is a great book.It provides everything you need to know about Python development.The authors write in a clear organized manner, and take the same amount of time to describe what other books take 1000 pages to do."
2,A disapointment,"I got this book looking to learn Python, and for that it's useless.I don't really see a point for the book, the author basically says ""if you want to learn python then you need another book"", this book is just something to refresh your memory from time to time for once you know Python. Though personally I wanted a book which taught me Python, and then I'd use THAT as the 'something to refresh your memory'.But now I'm stuck with a book which bypasses everything that teaches you the basic syntax of Python, I have no way of learning it with this book, it goes into the more complicated code examples and leaves out simple stuff like how to do IF statements etc.Unless you know Python well already, don't buy this book, it isn't for the beginner."
4,very useful reference,"I've made a complete switch to Python from Perl, and this book has been a very, very helpful resource in doing so. I have owned several other O'Reilly's Nutshell books (C++, Linux, Perl, and Java) but never found them as useful as Python in a Nutshell.Sure, Python does have a rather decent online documentation, which is free, but I often find it hard to find the exact information I want even using the index. Not the case with this Nutshell book; it covers the ground that you definitely need to know to get started early and do useful work immediately. Writing is very lucid, too.I only give four stars just because I didn't necessarily like the section on object-oriented coding basics. I found Learning Python to be easier to understand in that regard.This is not the best book if you are a programming beginner, but if you are trying to add Python to your programming arsenal knowning other languages already, I highly recommend this book as your handy companion."
3,Can't be definitive....,"I expected this to be as comprehensive as the Java in a Nutshell books (i.e., to cover all standard modules/functions). But the first time I crack the cover I can't even find 'signal' in the index. Sure enough, there's no coverage at all of this utterly standard topic. I had to look in Dave Beazley's book to get the info (there's a standard 'signal' module that's been in since at least python 2.0).It seems like a crime for a reference book to be 600+ pages long and not get around to at least listing all the standard modules in the language."
5,Well organized,"Well organized and informative ... just as one expects. It is a massive 1585 page book, written to satisfy both beginners and experts."
3,"This is a reference book, not a book for learning","I believe this is a good book for reference, but not for learning. Because it contains too few examples. My purpose for buying this book is to learn Python and this book does not serve my purpose well. Every time after I read a section, I have a lot of questions because I don't even understand some of the terms. At this point an example can improve my understanding, but that is what this book is lacking.On the other hand, this book covers everything about Python. So it is a good reference book."
4,ked's review,found them to be very comfortable. unlike most sneakers that look big and bulky which was why I chose them to purchase
5,Great Buy,"The set was as complete as advertised. Also the lowest priced. Cables arrived quickly, and now I am equipped to expand any HDTV set I may want to buy. High quality gold tipped cables!!!"
2,these songs were very slow,this cd is very slow i like more of usher's upbeat song on the track he released in 1997
5,9$ mp3 album from the guys that made it! tdrsmusic,"i say again, after years of hunting down rare albums from all times and genres, this is still availible at travis dickersons webstore, many bucket albums selling for 50$ or more are for sale for 15max. this is one is only availible for download, but you get the art work and the music, and to me it sounds the same as printed. i would sell metallica albums for 100$ even if lars ulrich sold the same for 8$, but buckethead and travis and many other artist on his site are cool and always will be, so support them, so they can keep on filling our buckets w those very sick sounds from that very strange man. plus their are other bucket items not listed on amazon such a blueprint(buckets first release, brought to bootsy and john zorn) get more bucket for you money!! [...]"
5,An Illuminating and Surprising Study,"Renée Curry's White Women Writing White is an admirably well researched, independent, brave, and often brilliant and startling book. It will undoubtedly prove germinal (and controversial) in critical whiteness studies. It provides an absolutely new perspective on the poets Hilda Doolittle (H. D.), Elizabeth Bishop, and Sylvia Plath. It draws attention, truly for the first time, to the racial signifiers in the texts of these three great poets. It treats whiteness as a marked characteristic in the same way as blackness and Asianness have traditionally functioned in mainstream American literature and culture. It repeatedly and convincingly locates racial meanings in passages that have never been read in that light before. This book transforms the landscape. It is the most significant new work on these poets in years."
4,A great insight on Prophet Elijah.,"I recommend this book for people named Elijah or someone naming their child Elijah, who desire more detail information on PROPHET Elijah's journey. I really enjoyed it!"
4,A poignant re-telling of history filled w/Hellenistic Pride!,A delightful way for a young child to learn about the history of the Olympic Games. Written in simplistic prose . . . filled with love of family . . . inspirational in terms of building a young person's pride in their Greek Heritage!
3,Good Soundtrack,"This soundtrack is good. I didn't really care for a couple of songs on the soundtrack though. My favorite song on the album is ""Give U My Heart"" by Babyface featuring Toni Braxton. This song is a great duet and its nice to jam to. Some of the other songs I enjoyed are Boys II Men's ""End Of The Road"" and Toni Braxton's ""Love Should Have Brought You Home"". I give this Soundtrack 3 stars."
4,All round excellent,"This album features great tunes - some aren't so good, but of the 12, I'd say 9 are very good - it's worth buying for track 3 alone - for those of you who've seen the film, it's the slow track he puts on before letting the women into his apartment! All round, a good buy - I'd give it 4.5 stars."
2,very average,"i liked the cut give you my heart by Babyface&toni Braxton also Toni's Love should have brought you home.Pm Dawns I'd die without you is tight and Tribe called Quest hot sex is alright.but after that it's weak.Boyz's 11 Mens end of the road hasn't aged and the rest of the cd is rather bland.you'd expect more with the likes of Babyface,Dallas Austin etc.. but it doesn't happen."
2,Okay Soundtrack,"I really don't care for this soundtrack. I only like the first one(Give U My Heart-Babyface and Toni Braxton)and the eighth one(Love Shoulda Brought You Home-Toni Braxton). The rest of the songs I don't like. I thought I would like almost all of the songs, but I don't. I guess End Of The Road by Boys II Men is sort of okay."
3,Boomerang-Original Soundtrack Album,"My cd arrived in a timely fashion and was an exact replica of what was described. However two of the songs were continuously skipping, the rest of the songs played very well. My seller sent me a full refund and I got to keep the cd."
3,"It's worth it for ""Give U My Heart""","The first track seems to be hard to find anywhere else but here, and so for the wonderful songwriting talents of Babyface, the album was worth its secondhand purchase price.The other songs are listenable, but not exceptional."
5,The first album under Laface records.,"L.A. and Babyface made a big name for themselves settling in Atlanta and founding their own record Label. They also promoted Toni Braxton, the first female solo artist under Laface, also in other words, the first lady of Laface. Plus Boyz II Men broke Elvis's record with End Of The Road which stayed at #1 for 13 weeks. Now to my favorite songs.Give U My HeartLove Shoulda Brought You HomeEnd Of The RoadYes! The three hits are definitely my favorites! All of my comments explain why the Boomerang soundtrack is my favorite movie soundtrack album of all time. Much love and respect for L.A. and Babyface."
2,Shallow but passably interesting.,"This book is a collection of personal encounters and recollections of death from the author's own experience and from various interviews and other sources. It has a folksy tone which should be accessible to most people. It covers a range of topics, such as life after death, euthanasia reincarnation etc., none of which are dealt with at any depth. I found it a little facile in it's analysis and the style was marred by numerous lapses in grammar. It contains some interesting case studies, several of which are open to a variety of interpretations, although the author seems to accept unquestioningly the one which suits her particular purpose. There is no coherent view of life and death presented but rather a pastiche of various half developed ""new age"" type theories. It's not a book I would give to anyone facing death and it certainly added nothing new to my own thinking on life, the universe and everything, but some of the studies were mildly interesting in places"
5,Enjoyable and enlightening,"Like everyone, I have questions about death and what lies beyond for our spirit. This book was a great source of answers and reassurance from people who have ""been there and done that"", and I found it fascinating. I would never have believed some of these things possible until I had a personal experience that left me looking for more answers and new possibilities. There is, indeed, so much more than meets the eye in this universe! Very interesting reading - I highly recommend it!"
3,Not a bad novel if you can find it,"Picked this novel up at a used bookstore for $1. Not one of Clement's best, but still entertaining and interesting in terms of its depiction of the two central characters (one human, one alien) and how they interact while stranded on an unusual planet. Typical of Clement, there are detailed descriptions of the planetary system, the two suns, how they influence the ""cycle"" of hot/cold weather, and the evolution of the unusual life forms found therein. Rather atypical for science fiction, there is no real violence or sex or technological wizardry to speak of. Hence, a somewhat old-fashioned, 1950s-style science fiction tale reminiscent of something that Asimov (a great admirer of Clement) or Bradbury might have written."
3,Robinson Crusoe in the Pleiades,"Marooned Earth teen and bug-eyed, little green man trek across a fire and ice planet.Hal Clement (pen name for Harry Clement Stubbs) wrote this in 1957. That accounts for the hard-science, pulp magazine, Jules Verne style.The focus of Cycle of Fire shifts from pedantic close-ups to disorienting time lapses; where suddenly a month goes by in half a sentence.Typical survival story and fairly easy to read. Up until the last section. Suddenly, the author dumps a load of interesting but dry orbital mechanics, geology, paleontology, genetics, political science, morals and sociology in your lap. The looming mystery is dispelled and all is revealed and solved by analytical rationalism."
1,Very Disapointing,"Its very hard to understand how two seasoned musicians of the calibre of Page and Plant could produce such a dud album.The production sounds like some cheap demo, but not in a good sense, just dull and flat. After Jimmys return to form on the Coverdale Page album, he sounds restrained and uninspired on this one. (much like he did on Zeps Inn through the Out Door)And I dont care what Mr.Plant thinks, the vocal performance and the songs on this disc still arnt as good as any Whitesnake album.Rob hasnt sounded any good since Physical Graffiti anyway, but all of his post Zep work still craps on this effort.If your gonna bag Coverdale you have to do better than this! What a letdown."
2,LOW KEY EFFORT,"No one was expecting Led Zeppelin reincarnated, but this is more like the leaves dropping off the tree. Understated, and not exactly incendiary. I was expecting a little more kick...perhaps John Paul Jones was missing. This CD doesn't see much airplay on my player. If you're a Zep fan, I would suggest looking to Robert Plant's solo works instead."
4,"A ""breadth"" of fresh air","This CD has elements of blues (blue train), folk (heart in your hand), country (walking into clarksdale), and the modern rock that Led Zeppelin established (shining in the light, most high). Page and Plant play very cohesively on this album, which has the relaxed feel of a well-worn pair of blue jeans. The recording has a lot of warmth to it (To compare, the Coverdale/Page redcording is clinical and cold). ""Blue Train"" is my favorite song that they won't play on the radio here.If you're interested in buying this CD, don't expect Zeppelin; the cover says Page and Plant. You can expect some fine music played by extremely talented musicians!"
3,Please Remaster this!!!!,"""Walking into Clarksdale"" has several great songs on it...""Most high""....""Heart in your Hand"".....""Blue Train"".....But the Sound is horrific! Where were Jimmys ears during this creation? Steve Albini should be hung by his balls.....There is so much bottom, you can`t here the drums or the bass....they come across as if you are listening to it under water!!! Take Page/plants..""No Quarter/Unledded""....Crank it up, listen....And then, without changing the volume or bass/treble...put on this cd....blagh! This needs to be Remastered right away!"
4,Two kinds of rock on this CD: Soft and Hard,It was very good. The only thing bad was that sometimes in one song the pace and loudness would change very quickly. Recomended to Zeppelin lovers
4,Mildly disapointing yet still very good,"The album was a lot more calm than I would have expected. Most High is very good and that was the sort of album I expected. Other songs were good also, but many were only so so. Still I will buy Page and Plant again when the next album comes out."
2,Leaders become followers,"LZ was enormously influential in the rock world. The most influential? Maybe.So it's odd to hear these songs, which echo many of the people who imitated Led Zep.A couple of them, you could swear, were written by Rush or Chris Isaak. I can't hear any signs of musical progression -- this is standard rock that would be good for an average band. For guys with their pedigree, it's a disgrace."
2,A boring record with little lasting impression,"I like two songs on this CD: Walking into Clarksdale and Shine a Light. The rest is boring and both men sound tired and feeble. There are a couple of Ok songs, but two thirds of the CD is way too slow and serious. What a disapointment. These guys mellowed out too much."
5,Awesome...,"Some music just grabs you by the b**ls and doesn't let go. This is one of those. Just ten years ago, Page/Plant came up with an album that not only rocks, but excites your senses. It is one of the most compelling LP's I've heard since early Zep from these guys. And the backing band (drums/bass) are well picked out and complement the music perfectly. This will go down as one of my favorite ""newer"" albums of all time. Newer, as in not 70's/80's rock, but done with a style and class not found in many of today's acts. Robert Plant has kind of stepped into the void left by premier songwriting talent that used to be Phil Collins. Look at the diversity of work he's done with Allison Kraus...Bravo gentlemen!"
4,Worth having,"If you love Led Zeppelin, this album is worth having - mostly for the song ""Most High"" which is musically very similar to a lot of the stuff on ""No Quarter,"" which is a much better album. The rest of the tracks are listenable, but you won't be screaming for them at a reunion concert."
4,The best Led Zeppelin album that Led Zeppelin never made.,"I really expected this to be a horrendous belly-flop; instead, it turns out to be the best post-Led Zeppelin team-up that's been released so far. Probably in deference to Plant's decreased vocal chops, the frames of reference here are more HOUSES OF THE HOLY and PHYSICAL GRAFITTI than LED ZEPPELIN I or II, but that's a good thing. It gives both Plant and Page a chance to stretch out on their mysterioso sides and not stay so much on the crotch-rock postures that haven't worn well over time. ""Shining In The Light"" and ""Most High"" are the best of the bunch, to my ears at any rate, but everything here adds new lustre to the music which, oddly enough, seems uniquely these guy's turf and no one else's. I've been playing this endlessly for two days in the car and it still sticks to the ears. Real fine!"
3,Wildly uneven,"Page and Plant seem to have bought into their own press. _WiC_ shows them coasting on their rep, having brought in a couple of amateur punks as their rhythm section. ""When The World Was Young"" is sheer beauty; ""Blue Train"" is a mellow ride. ""Most High"" could have been on a Plant solo album. The rest are unremarkable songs that sound alike. We'll never know why Robert wouldn't bring Jonesy back; more's the pity. Check out _Zooma_ and _The Thunderthief_ instead."
1,Can't stand it!,"I'm having a hard time getting through this album. Not melodic at all. To me it's too noisy, too sloppy, too annoying. I guess you'll have to be a die hard Led Zeppelin fan to like this. Not at all for the average rock fan."
1,Phewee,"Jimmy Page is my favourite guitarist ever but the last truly inspirational work was Physical Graffiti. My god this album is bad except for Shining in the Light but this is no where near as good as any Led Zep stuff. Jimmy maybe it is time to hang up the guitar? Unfortunately unlike the much missed Rory Gallagher and Hendrix, we miss Jimmy but is still alive come on Jimmy."
3,This is a good album!,"This is a good album. I say that remembering what these guys were a part of a long time ago. Zep came to my town (Winnipeg MB. Canada) way back in the late sixties or maybe 1970... if you remember the 60's you probably weren't really there! If Zep ever happened or not this would be a good album. Good not great!Page and Plant are both talented musicians and songwriters but this album is missing something that cuts it short from being great. The tasty licks are all there and the sound is smooth with just the right amount of drive and intensity to make it a ""good album"".I look forward to the day when these two guys decide to put petty ego behind them (where the Hell is John Paul Jones?) and show us what three talented, insightful and slightly arrogant bastards have to say to the world!This is a good album but it could be (and probably will get) a lot better."
3,it is also good,Not bad! This album was created one more time by ex Led Zep Pilots: Plant/page....When the world was young is my fave one! Most high is cool! Musical ensemble with orientalisic musical sound. But NO QUARTER album is still much better
4,Two people that changed the face of music got together again,"If anyone is looking for Led Zeppelin, it is not here. This isJimi and Robert with a very tight rhythm section made up of twoyoung guys. It's a great album. The songs come on chargedand always remain catchy.It's kind of like sitting around with a couple ofold guys, who just happen to be two of the most adored song-writers of a generation."
5,Not a Zeppelin Album (Thank God!),"Led Zeppelin was a tremendous band, perhaps the most creative and influential in hard rock history, but they had their swan song twenty years ago. So when 'Walking into Clarksdale' first comes through the speakers, keep in mind that Page and Plant have grown and evolved, both personally and musically, for two decades! How very boring it would be if they had simply slapped on ""Whole Lotta Love Part II"", made their money, and gone home. Instead, Jimmy and Robert challenge their audience with minimalistic arrangements and genre-twisting songs. The only song that falls flat, ""Burning Up"", is indeed every bit the classic rock retread that a lot of reviewers here seem to be pining for, but other than that, the album succeeds marvelously as a profound yet intimate presentation of Page & Plant's continued evolution. 'Walking into Clarksdale' is easily one of the ten best albums of the 1990s."
2,I waited so long for so little...,"As a die-hard Zep fan, I was really excited about this album. Sadly, I have to say it was a big let-down after 18 years of waiting.Plant's voice is deep, raspy and horrible throughout. Page meanwhile has lost all the subtletys and fluency that made him great. All we get now is one heavy distorted sound. Apart from ""Most High"", the songs are a let down as well. The production is also far too bassy and muddy and reminds me of ""In Throught the out door"".The last good thing Page did was the soundtrack to ""Death Wish II"". Its sad when guys like Clapton and Beck are getting better with age, that Page seems to be getting worse - the confidence and fluency have well gone in his playing.Here's hoping for next time around if there is one..."
3,"It was recorded too quickly , sounds too unpolished.","As a Led Zeppelin & related artist enthusiastic fan , I can state that WIC is fine but its too raw(in the bad way) and way too unpolished. It sounds like a bad recording of a live performance. it's not that the songs here don't sound like Zeppelin , they actually do , its just that the recording is awful. Walking into Clarksdale pales next to Robert Plants solo material and even the Coverdale/Page collaboration . There is no energy in WIC. I would like to see Robert resume his solo career .I'd rather hear something along the lines of Pictures at Eleven or Manic Nirvana instead of this in the future from Plant."
3,No Led Zep anymore,"This album is below my expectation. Though Page seems to be still vibrant, Plant is too meek and low. In the whole album, I can barely hear the voice of Plant. Few songs are good - Most high where duo tried to give a shade of Indian/Arabic music, Heart in Your hand where guitar work is excellent. The charisma of Led Zeppelin is missing at all. Overall, you may want to buy this album if you are a hardcore Led Zep fan."
3,Great but poor mix,Page and Plant still know how to strut their stuff. However some great moments on this cd are let down by the sound quality. Where in God's name are the drums? Their concert had drums and so did their last album. Steve Albini was the wrong choice.
4,Waiting on the platform,"The product itself was great, the supplier that amazon used was horrible (Rus Products). The unit was missing a charger, and the package tape was previously opened. No luck from the supplier, but Peg Perego backed their product and got me the missing part. My son loves it, even though he wasn't able to ride it on the day of his birthday due to the fact that we were unaware that we were missing a crucial piece. I am also upset with amazon for the reason that they provide you the ability to supply feedback on a seller, but then the seller has the ability to challenge your feedback with made up BS in order to make themselves look good."
2,Watch your kids closely,"This train tips over very easily if the child just reaches out for you. My shorter 2 year old can not hold the button down herself to make it go, and she tips it over. I walked out of the room for 5 seconds to grab my camera when my son got on it the first time and a heard the crash. I ran in and he was on his side along with Thomas. I have to stay by their side riding this toy just so they do not get hurt."
1,this toy not good,dont buy this toy my aolmost 2 year old son cant even press the button because of were you need to press it. he would need big hands to squeze the button on top of the bar. and my almost 3 year old daughter cant hold the botton down for more than 2 seconds and thats after i help her press it. they both get so mad at it it was set up 2 days and they would not even go near the toy i took it down.BIG WAIST OF MONEY POORLY DESIGNED FOR YUNG KIDS TOY.
3,"Great toy, limited shelf life?","I purchased this toy for my first son 3.5 years ago, and he loved it. At the time he was 2.5 yrs old, and the other reviews are correct, it was difficult for him to ""squeeze"" the ""go"" button. We wrapped a tie strap aorund it and it solved the problem, we would simply slide it to the right to keep the button engaged and it would go until he wanted to get off, then we'd slide it back left to stop. i recently brought it up from the basement for our next son, now 2.5 yrs old, and are having problems with its operation. The song will play but the train wont ""go"". Has anyone had problems with this? Can this be fixed?"
3,WARNING...Got ripped off... NOT NEW WHEN SHIPPED,"First of all, when i received the thomas train, it had crease damages all over. The volume sound of the train, horn, and bell is very low. Thomas's face also came off and is hard to put on because of the bent creases on the front part of the train. The seat clips that was to fastened the seat to the motorized cargo is missing, so i had to screw in two screws to hold down the seat so my child can ride securely.Most of all, this must be a immitation, because it came in a plain brown box that said ""Made in China"". I had an old Thomas Train before, and it comes in a box with a huge print sticker of the train and also it says ""Made in USA"". So something is wrong here.... either the seller LIED and said it's NEW and just refurbished it and stuck it in a box, or they're selling a black market version that is just horrible. I paid over $550.00 for this crap, and I will never do business with this company again."
5,Great Ride On Toy but....,"I bought this for my son for Christmas, which at the time he was only 14 months old. The age says from 18 months. The problem is he can't hold the button down to make it go so I have to walk around the train and hold the button for him. We had a playgroup over and there were kids that were over 2 years old and they couldn't hold the button down either. Overall my son loves it but its not age appropriate for him.Also, this toy is cheaper at Toys-R-Us. I got ours when it was on sale for $[...]. After Christmas they had them on sale half off for $[...]."
1,The worst buying experience EVER!,"BUYER BEWARE!!!!I recently ordered (December 15th, 2007) this product through Amazon filled by Joe Brands for my son for Christmas. On Amazon's website it says you can cancel an order any time before it ships, if it does ship, you simply refuse receipt. I canceled this order on December 16th less than 24 hours after I placed it, I called and emailed Joe Brands & emailed Amazon. Never the less the package arrives on December 22nd. I called the shipping company, called and emailed Joe Brands, emailed Amazon and the package was finally picked up on the 27th of December. The billing however has yet to be straighted out. My credit card has yet to be credited, I do not have the product, and no one returns calls or emails. BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
4,Great for 3+ year olds,"This ride on toy is great if your kids love Thomas the Tank Engine. There are only 2 poor designs on this toy:1. Kids needs to press and hold a button to start the train throughout the ride, if your kids are under 3 years old, they could not do that for long.2. The train will fall off the track if the rider swing left and right during the ride, my kid fell off the train once and hit his head. It's only safe if they stay still on the train while the train is going.Other than that, it's a great toy for your little Thomas fans."
3,"Fun toy, hard to use as is. . . a solution that worked for us","I have to agree with previous reviewers that this toy has design issues which make it inappropriate for children under 3 yrs or so. It requires hand strength that 18-36 month olds do not have. Also, there is a significant delay between the child's action of pressing the button and the train starting to move. This is confusing to younger children. He solved the problem himself by sitting on top of the train so that his bum constantly pressed the button, making it go. But this makes the train top-heavy and easily tipped over. So instead, we disabled the original ""on/off"" mechanism and installed a switch (from radio shack). He can very easily flip the switch to turn it on or off. He loves the toy now."
5,My Kids Love this Thomas,"My 2 yr old son and 3 1/2 yr old daughter love riding on Thomas. The only problem with this is that your child has to understand to hold down the ""go"" button or it will not continue to run. We had to remedy this by putting a small clamp on the button that they can easily remove when they want to stop. Also, unless the child sits real still and stays centered on the seat, the train gets very tippy. After a couple of spills, my son took a couple week break from riding on it and my daughter wouldn't try it at all. But, they have gotten over that and now ride it all the time."
1,Poorly designed,"I was so disappointed with this item. My son (who's 3) received this for his bday. The child has to continuously hold down a button with his hand to keep the train moving and my son couldn't do it. He ended up getting so frustrated, he broke down in tears! The noises the train makes are MUCH TOO LOUD! And you need a lot of room in your home to set up the track, which we do not have. I was surprised at how poorly designed this was since it's a Peg Perego. The manufacturers should've really tried this one out on the recommended age group before they released it. Why couldn't there be a pedal to step on to make it go like every other ride-on toy for little ones? I put it back in the box and back to the store it went."
2,mon of 2yr old,"My son loves the train, and rides on it for hours on end. However, the battery was low by the end of Christmas day and takes another 24 hrs to rechange which isn't conventient and for the price it should have a better battery. Also bought the Annie & Clarabel 3rd car which attaches for a second child. The train does not work well and barely goes it another child is riding in the attached car. The product could be improved with rubber on the train wheels or groved track and wheels so it doesn't slip. The product needs improvement for the lofty price."
2,Complete Disapointment!!,"This ride is very disappointing! This was a gift for my son's 3 year birthday. His grandparents bought the train & extra track and we set it up as a surprise for his Thomas party. We made childsize railroad signs, Sir Topham Hatt and had Harold flying over the train track. He had is own Island of Sodor. But none of the children at the party, including my son, could hold down the handle to keep the train moving. A couple of the children got their foot stuck when the train would go around the turns. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY! We returned it after 2 weeks of aggrivation. It should have a peddle like other battery power vehicles, he has no problem driving his truck that he received on his 2nd birthday."
1,Crapanese,"I have a musical ear, and learn languages best through songs and poetry. I was a French language and literature major, and took beginning French and Italian in college, and gained proficiency through varied mediums. I am a beginner in Spanish, so I thought level three Rapanese would be a challenge. It is not. It is two poeple chit-chatting, half the time in English, half the time in Spanish (with an American accent), going over extremely basic words and grammar, such as the present tense of ser (to be). Occasionally, if you fast forward enough, you can find this same English/Spanish babble set to music. Very disappointing! Obviously, there are people who love this, but I say too much talk, too little music, too basic."
3,"Easy to read clock, easy to use",I wanted something which was easy to read at night as I am pretty short-sighted. This does the job for me.Radio reception is average and sound is OK considering size and price of the unit.Easy to use overall.
4,Sony ICF-C153V Large Display Clock Radio with FM/AM/TV/Weather Band Reception,"I purchased this produce because of the Weather Band Feature. I live in the South where there are many Tornadoes and Severe Thunder Storms. This feature works great. The Radio features are also good. The only negative about this product is the Display. It is hard to read in the middle of the night. The contrast and color between the back light on the display, which is gold, and the information displayed, which is black, is not good. If they were reversed it would be better."
1,terrible,I just received this clock for Christmas and want to return it. The green display is so bad that you cannot read the time unless you look down at the clock.It is terrible.
3,Forgot about February 2009,"I had one of these for years and liked it. I LISTEN to TV to go to sleep. So, of course, I bought another one almost identical to it. Forgot about not being able to get the tv part of it after Febr of next year. Until that time, I would give it 4 stars."
2,It needs a revision,All AE diphthongs are missing. With a careful proofreading this may become a very useful addition to all libraries.
3,for the generic job huntress,"This book is for somebody looking for a job in Corporate America. I also suspect that this book was meant to be read alongside the rest of the Knock 'Em Dead series, which I will admit to not having read. There is a lot of helpful advice on interview tactics and negotiating, but the chapters on job hunting (what to do?) and selling yourself on paper (resume!) are thin and sparsely detailed. However, this would probably be a stellar book for somebody well-versed in resume construction who knows what job she wants, but has difficulty with phone calls and interviews."
3,Entertaining but ...,"Don't get me wrong, I like Bolitho. But it seems it is more dangerous to be the object of the now-captain's affection than to serve on a gun deck in the heat of battle."
3,Bolitiho saga continues against a ruthless French Admiral,"Using his familiar formula, Alexander Kent continues the Bolitho saga on both sides of the Atlantic. Facing a ruthless Admiral while under the command of an incompetent Commodore, Bolitho mut deal with personal and professional difficulites. In this story, he must come to terms with the legacy of his brother while awaiting the birth of his first child. In typical Kent fare, Bolitho survives blockade duty, Caribbean swamps and near mutiny to set the score even with a ruthless French Admiral, commanding a superior force."
4,COMMENTS BY GRAHAM JONES,HARD HITTING NOVEL WITH BOLITHO RECEIVING WELL DESERVEDSUPPORT FROM HIS OFFICERS AND CREW DESPITE TRYING TIMES.LIKE THE ACTION
1,Did They Improve It?,"Did Timeless Media correct the problems customers experienced with their first release of Riverboat, or is this just a repackage with the same problems? The one review on this set only talked about the program, not the quality of the set. Buyer beware until someone actually watches this set and lets the folks know about its quality."
3,"OK, not great","This granola has no actual almonds. It is also too sweet. Other than that it's OK. If you're looking for really good granola, try Udi's (available on Amazon, but not through Subscribe and Save)."
2,way too sweet...,"This granola and also the tropical fruit one, are both way too sweet. I usually eat sweet home farm low fat granola, and some people find that one too sweet also, I agree sweet home farm has a little too much sugar, but this one, is even hard to eat, I usually eat my granola with very little milk (1/4 of a cup for two servings) , this one the only way that I can eat is with unsweetened soy milk...and a lot of it, with all other brands that I tried I can use regular milk."
4,King Charles II,"I love history especially British history. I am a parent of a King Charles Cavalier Spaniel. This is one reason why I ordered this DVD. The dogs were beloved by Charles I and II,an eddit was issued by Charles II that the Cavaleirs be aloud anywhere, even Parliment. I was impressed that the DVD took a few days to arrive. I will be ordering from the seller AGAIN."
4,History comes alive,"I very much enjoyed this four-episode drama about Charles II life. I think a perfect balance was found between the private and political sphere of the king: both was portrayed excitingly and vividly depicting his personality both as man and king with strengths and weaknesses as well. The Restoration Age, as its king, is shown in detail with its splendour and decadence.A superb cast is empolyed including Rufus Sewell, Rupert Graves and the excellent Shirley Henderson among others. The music is beautiful. A documentary film about Charles' childhood and adolescence can be found on the dvd as an extra which is also worth watching."
3,The king was a sex maniac,"Rufus Sewell is one of my favorite actors and his work in the film was very good but the movie itself fell on its face, in my opinion. Even with all the sex and beautiful sets, I was bored."
4,great- but not long enough,"great period piece of a my fav english period-- wish it was longer- so many characters of the king's court and time were so interesting to study, it would take many hours to tell the stories and i would sit through all of them. great acting esp. sewell."
1,Simply dreadful,"Wonderful costumes and sets and fine actors cannot help this miniseries. It was torture to watch. The story of this king is compelling and deserves better treatment, but the writers can't seem to do that, relying every 20 minutes or so on ""naughty"" suggestions of oral sex and lesbian exploration to keep the viewers glued to the set. I love period dramas from the BBC, but this was a miss."
3,What was A&E thinking?,"Other reviews have treated this DVD fairly, both in its good and bad points. The worst of all, as has been noted, is that for some foolish reason, A&E cut an hour out of the production. To add insult to injury the very first scene of the making of featurette shows a scene that does not appear in the American version.Finally, why is there no captioning or subtitling in this DVD? Does A&E not care for the hearing impaired or those who don't understand the language of the period and might benefit from the subtitles? My wife is Japanese and can easily follow Brit dramas when she has subtitles to read. Another of my friends is hearing impaired, and neither could enjoy this dvd. I note the british video cassette has captions--wasn't able to find the information for the DVD."
5,"The Original, and Vastly Preferable 4-Hour Version","This is the full 4-episode, 4-hour version of the superbly written (Adrian Hodges), directed (Joe Wright), designed, shot and acted mini-series. In the U.S., it was shown in a version that was heavily cut (by 1 hour!) and slightly bowdlerized (f.i., no view of a topless Nell Gwynn posing for a court painter) called The Last King. The original U.K. version, on 2 discs, is vastly preferable in every way. If you can play Region 2 DVDs, avoid The Last King and buy this."
1,The last king--dvd,"I rented this from Netflix and loved it--it came as two separate discs, for Part I and Part II.The DVD that I bought from Amazon had the entire movie on one disc--about one-third of it is unplayable, it skips and freezes! I checked it against Amazon's DVD troubleshooting tips and nothing worked.I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with this purchase."
2,Deceiptful Product Description,"Once again, I was TWICE ""fooled"" by A&E;'s format description of their dvds - this time it was the historical movie ""The Last King"". According to the format info of this dvd as described on Amazon's website, this dvd included CLOSED CAPTIONS and IT DOES NOT!!!!! It is my opinion that ALL DVDS should have conventional subtitles in English and in another language (Spanish, for example...) or AT LEAST Closed Captions both for the hearing impaired AND for English teachers who use English spoken movies as audio and visual aids in class to improve their foreign students fluency and knowledge of the English language and culture! It is INCREDIBLE that producers of great documentaries on dvd such as A&E; and The History Channel are not focussed on such an important issue! SHAME ON A&E; and THC !I would also like to advise Amazon to ensure that the DVD product offered online actually provides all the specifications informed."
3,The Last King DVD Review,"Very well-made, well-written, and well-acted miniseries with nice music score. I've given a three-star rating because contrary to the DVD's cover, which states the film is in 16:9, it is NOT so. The picture is colorful and very good but it is NOT enhanced for 16:9 TVs; it is, however, in widescreen with an aspect ratio of about 1.66:1."
1,"My review is not on the series, but the DVD.","I've reported this to Amazon and hope the page will be updated and once that has done so I will remove the review. However, until then, I'm leaving this in hopes it helps other people. The page states this DVD has Closed Captioning when it does not. It has no subtitles either so for anyone who is hard of hearing please be aware of this."
1,Worthless,Didn't come with any instructions and missing parts. I had to modify the brackets to install it then it never worked. Just crap.
3,Playful Pawn of the Gods,"Mr. Rhymer brings a playful sense of youth and vitality to this classic tale of destinies, Olympian political squabbling, and human heroics.The pace is fast, the language is accessible, and the rendition of events is true to the mythological threads which are their source. A nice expansion is the greater insight into the interplay between the various deities caught up in the machinations of this plot, and Perseus' own struggle with the pride so clearly evident in the behaviour of his divine relatives.It is well worth a read~For those with an eye for the printed word, there are some formatting issues, such as with the few footnotes, and infrequent typographical errors present in the Kindle Edition of Perseus. They should not detract from your reading of this enjoyable journey toward heroism, and the embrace of destiny."
5,This is a must read before & after having children!!!,Cassandra Mack is to single moms what Iyanla Vanzantis to sisters and brothers who've found value in thevalley - a healing balm. Her book provides healing forthe single mom's soul as well as practical wisdom forsurviving and succeeding as a single mom. It's thebest book of its type that I have read.
5,The Single Moms Little Book of Wisdom,"At times this book made me laugh and at times it made me cry, because it spoke to my heart and ministered to my soul, without coming accross as preachy or superficially motivational.As a single mom of a five year old and a seventeen year old, I found this book to be extremely helpful and healing. If you've ever felt overwhelmed, dissatisfied with where your life is headed and in need of a personal pick-me-up, this book will help you discover a new sense of resiliency and embrace the best that you have to offer. The book is small enough to read in one or two sittings, but you'll need to periodically re-read each tidbit of wisdom to really take it all in and apply the lessons to your life, especially the chapters on Grace Under Pressure and Letting Go of Excess Baggage."
5,Darren's book is (almost) as good as his classes!,"If you are not lucky enough to live in SF and take classes from Darren, this is a wonderful book. Darren is a fantastic teacher with lots of thoughtful ideas on the practice of yoga (as well as a great sense of humor and overall perspective.) If you live in the Bay Area, take one of his classes or workshops - you'll want more and will find this book inspiring."
5,-highly recommend-,"For me, this is one of those books that you cant wait to finish so you begin reading it again. Darren has a unique talent for bringing ancient yogic philosophy into modern day terms. I just attended his 3 day workshop in Denver. I am inspired to say the least."
5,Fantastic Book For New and Experienced Yogis,"As a yoga teacher, I recommend this book to all of my students. It's great for both new and experienced yogis as it explains yoga philosophy in a way that is easy to understand. It is also filled with wonderful stories, quotes and little bits of wisdom. An essential book for anyone who wants to learn about yoga off the mat."
5,Favorite line of pans ever,"I've used these pans for years- I've used them on electric coil and glass top stoves. They are heavy duty, the strainers are a key feature for everything, and to top it off, the round hollow handles are actually comfortable (unlike some of the high-priced stuff that uses a narrow angular solid piece of metal that digs into your hand, or doesn't fit well- which is a big deal when you want a good grip on a full pot)."
2,Hard to clean,"The outside is smooth, but the inside is an extremely rough sanded/brushed finish. Everything sticks to it, and the texture is deep enough that even scrubbing it with a brush doesn't really work. I have other steel pots without a perfect mirrored finish on the inside, but none of them are as rough as this one. This is the only one I can't get clean with any effort.The strainer lid is really handy. I also like how the handle is attached with hefty rivets, not with tiny spot welding like cheaper brands."
5,Good product,"I like this saucepan a lot. When I make oatmeal or boil milk, I use this pot and nothing hardly sticks... just got to use the right temperature. Bar Keeper's friend is recommended to keep this looking shiny... I've used this pot a lot so speaking from experience, I have had zero problems with it. :-)"
1,They don't make them like they used to...,"I purchased the 3 quart and 5 quart Wearever pots because I have a 1.5 that I've used for years and it still looks like new. I've been meaning to buy some bigger ones and I thought these were a good price. I expected them to have the same good quality as my older one. I got them today, and immediately saw the quality was deficient. I cut my finger on a sharp edge under the handle! I compared them to my 1.5, and the edges of my 1.5 are smooth and well-made. The pouring lips on the new ones are barely there, tiny, compared to a nice 1/2"" lip on the older model. The picture of the 3 quart on the listing isn't the same as the one sent to me, with no metal plate and rubber washer under the lid handle to buffer from the heat. Neither one of pots had this plate on the lids. I didn't even open the shrinkwrap around them, and quickly repacked them and sent them back! So disappointing."
4,Thin handle gets hot,"My criteria for cook wear is that they are 18/10 stainless steel, multi-ply (all-around, if possible). One reviewer complained that the pan is too heavy - but that is exactly what I was looking for --- more mass = even heating and better heat retention in the body of the panHaving a strainer cap is a plus.Reason for 4* is that the handle is formed from THIN stamped steel and rolled into a wide handle. The lack of mass means lower heat capacity and thus the Handle HEATS up much more quickly. For example, heating up half-a-pan's worth of water to a boil is enough to make handle uncomfortable to hold.edit: just last week i walked through a Safeway and saw it for 26$. I bought it at Amazon for 34$. Currently (1/20) it is priced at 37$. Yikes! check your local stores."
4,Richard,4 out of 5 as have only had item a few weeks. Nice feel and does the job. Clean up is easy and I like the strainer cover.
5,too heavy,"seems like a nice pot... but, have not used it.... want to return it... description does not include the weight.... if you want a heavy pot this one's for you... but for me.... it's too heavy to be comfortable... and if it were filled it would take both hands and effort to carry"
4,good book for non readers,I bought this for my 5 year old. The pictures are just beautiful and unique. I am getting tired of the too many farm/animal books. Always looking for something different. The pictures keep a little ones attention and the verse is simple.
3,"Quite religious - if that bothers you, don't bother but.....","One of my hobbies is reading biographies and autobiographies of the Hollywood stars from the 1930s to the 1950s. I find these people ultimately fascinating - how they stories differ, intertwine, and yet are the same in some respects. I'm always amazed by how many of them had either no or deceased fathers (Jane Russell included). If you are bothered by anyone speaking their mind about their religious beliefs, this is not the book for you (and neither is Ginger Rogers' autobiography). Jane Russell presents her story in a straight forward, down to earth, no excuses manner. Not exactly professionally written but readable nonetheless. It doesn't deserve the lambasting a previous reviewer gave it."
5,Great Value,Book came really fast Thank you. She was always one of my favorite actresses and I will sorely miss her. Her legacy shall live on. Thanks again!!!!
4,Slashdog POV,"As someone who started skating even before Thrasher published their first issue, and who has an extensive collection of Thrasher magazines, I too was a little underwhelmed by this book. Nevertheless, it's a worthy effort at summing up what Thrasher was and is.The print quality is top notch, and the photography is excellent. Many pages are occupied by short bios of ""Legends"", skaters that have left indelible marks on the art of skateboarding over time. These offer little more than polish on the already established fame/infamy of those mentioned, though.I was expecting more of Thrasher's seminal articles reprinted, but besides that pillar of skateboard writing, ""Skate and Destroy"", from 1982 they are few and far between.All that aside - Thrasher remains the truest, most meaningful print expression of skateboarding. Don't forget - Thrasher was there when skateboarding appeared dead to the eyes of the world at large, and they're still here."
2,Disappointing,Maybe my expectations were too high but I really expected quite a bit more from this book. It's really just a collection of photos from each year with a couple of descriptions here and there. I expected much more from the early years and either reprints of articles or some new content. How can you not have a section on Pushead? Just not what I expected and fairly weak.
5,My son LOves this book,I bought this book for my 16 yr old son who is an avid skateboarder. He loves this book. It is definitely a collector item filled with many unknown and interesting facts through out the yrs of skateboarding....
5,I love it.,Works great. Fulfils my need for swimming laps for exercise. Doesn't slide down when I'm swimming laps as regular trunks do.
2,too thin fabric and does not last long at all,"Great fit, low price, but it is made from really thin fabric and does not last long at all, will spend more for different brand."
1,not worth it!,"after a few days use, the color faded and the jammer is full of knots.I will not buy this product again."
3,Didn't hold up,"They worked OK, but fell apart in less than six months of 3x/wk use and diligent rinsing after use. Other brands have lasted twice as long for almost the same price (Speedo and Reebok). If you still want to buy, I found that sizing was fairly accurate unlike the aforementioned brands"
4,Jammers,"As my son recently joined his HS swimteam, he needed these jammers for practices. The price was excellent and so far the quality is too. He loves them, has stated that they make a real difference in his performance."
2,Diluting the Trance Genre...,"I was so dissapointed to hear this commercial-ready compilation by such a ""superstart"" DJ. There are a few decent tracks on this which can be found on probably 1,000 other mixed CDs, but the rest is garbage that is commercially prepared for the next shampoo or shaving cream commercial. Trance music can be such a powerful and emotional force but this CD is plagued with these horrible love-sappy vocals that pulls this genre away from electronic expression and into the pop norm. AVB is a decent DJ and this compilation feels nothing more then a few recycled (yet powerful) old tracks acting as glue to push out some other mediocre talent tracks. From someone like him I expect a lot more. This is nothing more then his name on a comp acting as a promotion tool for the record label. Sad sad sad. Save your money on this one..."
5,Intelligent Power Pop,"With a sound a lot like Fountains of Wayne but much more advanced songwriting, it's a crime that Crunchy doesn't get airplay. Great guitar licks, funny lyrics, the album's just a blast from beginning to end."
2,Occult methods of healing,"There is nothing that says what is the occult methods of healing, graphics are beatiful at the end of the book."
5,5 stars and more,This album is flawless! This is their best CD out. There's no reason to skip any tracks or skits. Their first album is definately a classic.
5,LaFace should release a digital remastered version,It's probably the best rap CD...but the sound quality is like a cassette not a Cd
4,Near classic,"The is a near classic album. Better than most. But its Outkast, what else do you expect?"
5,One of the best southern albums ever!!!,"Outkast's first cd ""southernplayalisticadillacmuzik"" is one of the best southern albums to come out to date. It shows the raws skills and true playa beats that the title makes it out to be. Every song is a hit, although standouts are ""Hootie Hoo"", ""D.E.E.P."", ""Players Ball"". Overall an excellent buy for anyone and a must have for Outkast fans."
5,Funky Ride daaawwg,"Dis some funkaaaay shizzizzle dawg, yall be trippin if y'aint down! Smoke Fat, Listen Loud! Love"
3,Picture does not represent product,"Picture shows square tube, much better mounting style and cut outs for trailer wiring. DISSAPOINTEDAlso, package came wrapped in thin foam (no box) and had scratches, dings and scrapes in powder coating."
5,Tropiclean spray,It's okay. I like the old formula better. This one smells different. The old one smelled like peach. This one has a more soapy smell.
5,"Great product, great service","I would like to start that I purchased a school textbook for about half the retail price from this seller. The book I ordered came three days earlier than amazon said it would. Great price, and a quick delivery. Will order from this seller again."
1,not in the US,I ordered a book to be used in the US and when i received my book it was not to be used in the US. I wish i would have been notified before hand.
1,Wrong Item,"I typed in the ISBN for the Tenth Edition of this book, and even though Amazon said to ignore pictures, I was sent the Seventh Edition instead of the tenth. I had to drop my class and now have a book I won't use."
5,Great model example,Typical Tamiya model kit. Very precise and well made. This will be a great addition for any diorama with German aircraft.
3,It's great!,"I'm no DC comics fan, but I love to collect DC Direct figures, love the sculpts and everything. If you are a fan of the JLA or Wally West, you should pick this up!"
3,"A little dry, but a worthwhile read with lots of info","Purchased this book to help become more familiar with the Hopi people for a job. Very good book but a little dry to read at first. Helpful in understanding the Hopi worldview. Would recommend this book to anyone working with the Hopi, working in the Southwest, or wanting more information and insight into the Hopi people."
4,The Hopi Bible,This lovely little book is laid out in chronological sequence and tells the Life Story of the Hopi people from the very beginning of time. Comes with great illustrations and diagrams relating to the Hopi Prophesy.
5,Frank Waters' Book of the Hopi---A seminal Work,"This is the most detailed, accurate account of the religious life of America's most spiritually powerful Indian tribe. The Hopi's life IS their religion and it is powerful in a way one cannot analyze, only experience. Anyone who has ever had the honor to experience a Hopi ceremonial or sit and listen to the wisdom of Hopi elders knows this. Frank Waters has captured both the fact of their ceremonials and the mystical, metaphysical reality behind it, including the human intrusions back and forth between the real world and that of the spirit. This is the definitive book on the Hopis, both as a people and as a religious order ""responsible for the spiritual welfare of the western hemisphere."" My thanks to Mr. Waters and to the Hopi people."
3,Not NEW as listed.,"Received the ""Book of the Hopi"" in a timely manner but the book was listed as new and it definitely was not. Had an old price sticker on the front that had been partially peeled off. It doesn't matter to me, I'll read the book anyway but it should not have been listed as new."
5,Burt Carols of Christmas,This Anniversary issue of these wonderful Carols is excellent and it is a joy to hear voices no longer with us sing these. It was a highlight of the season for me. I have been familiar with these carols for 40+ years and have sung these carols in the Episcopal Church here in Marquette MI which Bates Burt served. I truly enjoyed this new recording.
1,Very Disappointing,"The greatness of the Burt carols lies in the beauty and simplicity of the melodies. Unfortunately, these artists put themselves out in front, not the songs themselves. Listening to ""Singers Unlimited"" sing Alfred Burt is painful! One performance where a Burt song actually is allowed to speak is the Peggy Lee recording of ""Star Carol."" The Dave Grusin instrumental of ""Some Children See Him"" isn't bad either. I'd love to find a good recording of the Burt carols, but this definitely isn't it."
5,Best contemporary gospel album ever!,This cd is amazing! The much anticipated album for DeLeon was definitely worth the wait! I honestly enjoy listening to every track. I guarantee you will not be disappointed!
2,Not that great....,"She has a nice voice...it does not sound very ""strong"". Overall, I only liked maybe 3 songs on this CD and they were basically some of the older songs that she ""re-made"". The other songs sounded too much like she was trying to sound like Aliyah or somebody (but then again, some people like that).... I thought that there was too much heavy breathing and panting....I also thought the cover was really too reavealing to be a christian woman (her stomach is out)....Christians can look good without looking ""seductive"". You don't promote a Gospel CD by looking ""sexy"". I thought the focus was ""Jesus""? Remember him?"
5,Purely Swell,"While this does not displace 41 as my favorite Swell, it is a viable addition to the Swell library. It has the songs that are fun to listen to the first time through (Next to Nothing, War Comes Down), and then there are the songs that drag you in a bit more slowly. These are the ones that will become my ""Swell staples"" (Always Everything, California Arizona). There's only one song on the whole disc that I'm not crazy about, and that's ""Say Goodbye.""It's absolutely terrific headphone music, and great for listening to while you work, drive, or just about anything. I highly recommend Swell to anyone. They deserve to be heard."
3,Keeping this One,Has a good suggestion re: dry massaging I never knew about and picked up some good ideas that relate more to my condition that I was curious about. Alot of the things he mentions have been said before re: eating and vitimins and minerals.
5,Flashman at it again,"I really enjoy this series of books about Harry Flashman, coward, scoundrel, and unwitting hero of the glory days of the British Empire. This series, which has been ongoing for 30 years, always delights me with its wit, and also with instilling knowledge of many exotic places and events. The scholarship behind the tales is quite sound, for I have read about a lot of these incidents and what the author presents (with the exception of Flashman's participation, of course) is accurate. This latest work is a combination of three different incidents, each one different and entertaining. You know that our ""hero"" is always going to get out of the situations in which he finds himself, but the joy is in reading and discovering how he accomplishes it. May this series go on for another 30 years!"
4,The Long Awaited Return of Flashman is here,"Just when you thought you heard the last of Sir Harry Flashman he pops his head up with more tales told out of school. This is his 11th Adventure, and it seems that even as he ages he never changes. George MacDonald Fraser has done it once again with the ever cowardly Flashman, put in with some well known people and places and dispite his being a coward, a liar, a rogue, and more Sir Harry comes up smelling like a rose. Mr. Fraser has mixed fact and fiction to bring his charater to life. I have read all of Mr. Fraser's Flashman stories and at the end of each one I wanted to see what Harry would do next. This novel is no different. Who will be next, Tombstone AZ, or will it be with ""Chinese"" Gordon? I will eagerly await for more from Mr. Fraser."
4,Flashman strikes again...,"An aging Flashy proves that his incredible luck is yet still with him.I'm a fan of Unabridged books on tape, and sometimes they can get, well, rather long. Not this gem. As with the typical Flashman adventure, Flash gets in trouble repeatedly, and somehow, it always manages to become someone else's trouble. Yes, it is hard to imagine why those folks don't see through Col. Flashman, but they don't. Do they?The reader of this tape has exactly the accent that you always expected Flashy to have. David Case is an accomplished reader, and he has managed to get Flashy perfect, if a tiny bit thick, but did you imagine Flashy any other way?In any case, this is unabridged, so you don't miss a bit of Flashman action."
5,Great Cd,I enjoyed every song on the cd wish he was still doing music . For the people who didn't get this cd really missed out on a great cd
3,TALENTED VOCALIST LOST IN A SEA OF MOSTLY AVERAGE SONGS.,"Salter is a vocalist to watch for. However, with the exception of the standout title song(!!!), it's routine assembly-line R&B here.The other songs are good but sound like any other jam on Quiet Storm radio these days.KDP"
5,The best all around R&B CD I've ever listened to.,This CD was the best CD I've ever listened to from track 1-13. This was a good buy. Definitely 5 stars.
4,~PURE... Undiluted talent!!!~,"Sams stunning debut, absolutely defines how R&B should sound like. Lyrics so rich in content, which are showcased in "" I love you both "" ~show a brighter side of men. Also melodies which will drive one insane, (especially 2wards the break of dawn) are displayed in this CD. This is one of the rare Babyface projects which leave the artist's vocal undiluted with the genius' trademark. For follow up albums, Mr Salter can do better by disbanding from the trend of sampling other people's songs as in ""After 12 before 6"", though I must admit he added some bit of 'salt' 2 it. MY...MY ...MY! Keep it up bro! You bet this album evoked a love spot ""On my heart""."
4,Salter is nice and sweet!,"This is a great cd, even though i bought it in 2005 and it was produced/recorded in 1997. Im a big fan of lots of music, more so in the R&B; and Rap genres; so i can say this is a WELL put together cd with some really well made songs.This best song is by far ""Your Face (#1)"" Sam Salter has a phenomenal voice. Get this cd if you like or love R&B; music. Sam Salter definately gives R&B; artist today a run.This deserves a 5Star review, but I clicked 4 on accident and cant change it now.... :*( me wanna cry.--------------------My Rating System is based on Amazon's:* = Hate It** = I Don't Like It*** = It's Ok**** = I Like It***** = I LOVE IT!--------------------"
2,Pitiful...,"So-so graphics.NO detectable save system - you die, you start over...AND you can die during the training missions, result = start over.No pre-mission strategy and/or prep-screen (sometimes I would like to pick my own insertion point, weapons, support, etc..)I bought this game at some computer expo for 1/3 price: I paid to much.Get one of the Delta Force games instead."
5,Interesting and Enjoyable All Around,"I first heard ""Robert L. Ripley"" on Pandora, and consider it one of my top finds. I find this enjoyable both musically and lyrically. This is definitely an album worth listening to; I recommend it for your collection!"
3,Not quite what I was hoping for....,"While the information in the book is decent enough, I had somehow missed that it has a fairly strong bibilical base. I have since gotten the book, You Have to Say I'm Pretty, You're My Mother, and it's a better fit for what I am looking for. I am planning to send this one onto my sister, whose beliefs are more inline with the christian principles in the book."
1,Too much religion.,This otherwise promising book relied too heavily on God and religion for the lay reader.
3,not too bad,"This is a nice compact dictionary with most of everything you need. One size above this would be better because it has more words and is in an easier print to read. If I had to choose again, though, I would choose the bigger one."
4,A good but old dictionary,"I have found this dictionary to have the best content of all the small-enough-to-carry-around German dictionaries (this one is a little big to call a pocket dictionary), but potential buyers should be aware that the publication/copyright date for this dictionary is 1993, NOT March 2003 as advertised. Langenscheidt advised me that a new edition is expected in 2008. I would also have preferred a hard-back and sewn edition for a book this size that gets carted all over the place, but I don't know that other pocket dictionaries are any better in this regard."
4,Langenscheidt's German Dictionary,I have found this dictionary to be very useful. First of all ive been learning german for a while and i havnt found a word thats not in this dictionary. Its layed out in a easy to read and understand fashion. The biggest bonus for me was the very easy to carry with you size.I would recommend it to anyone learning german!
1,Teeth started breaking after three days!!,"I thought I was getting a ""hard rubber"" comb. Hard plastic is not the same as hard rubber!!! Product description was not clear! I put in an internet search for a hard rubber comb!!"
5,Works great as a comb,I've been using this comb for months now and it is still like new. This finish is just like new and the bristles are working great. The bristles are perfectly spaced for regular hair making it easy to comb my hair.
3,Very decent,"I bought this trying to avoid the ""saw"" feeling of combs that are molded and don't properly have the injection spots sanded down. This one is better, but I still get the saw feeling every once in a while. It's a good, sturdy comb, but I might spend a little more and get a better quality one."
5,"Comb; small, simple, well-made, works","When space is at a premium (one-bag travel), the comb is still the personal grooming tool of choice. Forget the brush -- it takes up so much space that it should be left at home. This thing takes up almost no space at all and does everything a brush does as long as your hair isn't really long or really curly (or if you comb it before it gets dry). It is still possible to travel with a single bag (check out onebag.com for tips), but the airlines keep making it more difficult to get everything into the ""one bag."" This is a great comb and seems to hold up well to travel in a grooming kit along with toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, sewing kit, etc. Yeah, you look like your dad when you pull this out. There is a pretty high dork factor on this. Close the bathroom door first if you must. Functionality over style when we are talking travel."
2,Works on my husbands long curly hair. UPDATE!,"My husband likes to comb conditioner through his shoulder-length curly hair so this does the trick. He said it wasn't the BEST comb he's ever had, but it does the trick. We've only had it a short time but the teeth seem to be holding up better than the one from the dollar store.That was my previous review after only having it a week. Since then all the teeth in the middle have started falling out. Granted, My husbands hair is thick and curly and he uses this to comb in the shower, it lasted about a month. I bought one with wider teeth and a handle. If you have thin hair or comb delicately, I guess this could work for you."
4,A great reference,A book I use regularly as a junior pathologist. I wish they had more pictures IN COLOR but otherwise it's a useful text.
2,"Okay, but out of date and not very practical","I can imagine this book would have been very useful in 1984 when it was written, but with the myriad advances in statistical software, not to mention the field of cluster analysis itself, it isn't that much use today. If you are looking to understand and perform cluster analyses with something like SPSS, this book is not at all what you need. If you are looking for a very general understanding of cluster analysis as it was 22 years ago then this might be okay, but otherwise you should look elsewhere.I feel a bit cheated having bought it on the basis of the other reviewer's glowing recommendation. As a colleague of mine says ""An idiot learns from his mistakes, a clever man learns from other people's"". Learn from this idiot's mistake and don't buy this book."
2,Waste of money,"First I didn't realize the book is a small in size w/ small printing, definitely needed a stronger pair of glasses to be able to read comfortably.The book does not really contain anything that can't be found in a number of other books on Italian cooking. The anecdotes are nothing remarkable, all the recipes, or ones similar to them, can be found in other more reliable, professionally prepared sources. There are several recipes for sardines. I'm of Sicilian heritage and a former professional cook, and love sardines, but...Just paging through the book I think there are at least 4-5 sardine recipes and several rissoto recipes. Spaghetti w/ tomato sauce???? Was this recipe really needed?A quick search using ""Italian Cooking"" will bring up a bunch of better choices, many of which I own. This was one of those impulse purchases, came up with another search, looked like it might be interesting.......It isn't.Overall, the best part of the book is the preface."
3,Vapid Mismash,"In my opiniont he author wants to cram too much information and action into a limited space....the mix of history and fantasy do not fit seemlessly...the hero gets mangled...the hero rebounds with little ill effects ,gets captured, mangled,recovers etc...the few snippets of history are interesting but I felt remote from all the chacters....the book reads like a ""Boy's Own Adventure"" story with elements of the ""Quest"" and the ""Three Musketeers""...as historical fiction it may have been O.K. but with the pseudo scienific magic......it left me cold"
5,Heart wrenching and joyous at the same time!,"The fourth book in the Journals of Corrie Belle Hollister holds its own with the previous three! Not as much action (yet it has its times!), but had a way of making the reader emotionally spent. As the title suggests, this book was a lot about how everyone, in God's eyes, has his or her own place in the sun/world. Christian values and morals are upheld superbly throughout the novel! The love that God gives shines through in this novel; whether it be through the little things that happen to Corrie or whether it be through the love of those around her, even though love seems not to have been earned. Very good!"
4,"In eight books, this was the zenith...","I never found Corrie's diary more interesting than I did in regard to the conflict between Almeda and Katie. Almeda's secret and Katie's loss were well portrayed, and I really *cared* about what happened to the two of them. This was the high point of the series--from here, they only went down. It must have been Judith Pella's departure from the team that kept the rest of the series from meeting the standard set by the first four!"
2,Poor quality product,This product had at one time been damp to the point of mildew .... It never should have been resold. I am looking to replace it but to return would have been more than it was worth. I will avoid purchasing here in the future.
4,Great Live Solos!,"Great to have an album of live solos gathered together instead of the sometimes comparatively lifeless studio sessions! Just a comment on the review that said 'Zakir is referring to the time signature ""6.5/4"", what he really is saying is that its just 13/8. No need to make others think that its amazingly complex when its just a simple rhythm with a flashy name' ... this reviewer didn't know what he was talking about since some time signatures have always been classified that way in India. This is not a concoction of Zakir Hussain, and neither is it intended to make anything look complicated, it's just a different way of doing it, that's all."
5,it gives us an opportynity to listen zakir in different mood,"i am a great fan of zakir hussain.and i know many friends who became his fan after listening to this album. zakir has an ability to entertain the audiance even while remaining ""almost"" classical.sometimes he even takes freedom from pure classicalness,but that also entertains the orthodox classical music ians.this album is a proof (it at all it is required!) that zakir is a god in anything that concerns with percussion music..."
5,perfect,These are perfect pulls for our newborns dresser. This is super high quality product and these are very highly recommended!!
5,Yellow Ducky handles,"Very happy with the price, item arrived very quickly and it was exactly what I had hoped for. I would order again."
5,Fabulous Find,"I love the ducky drawer pulls. The price was unbeatable after lots of comparison shopping and they arrived in a timely fashion. Plus, they are even cuter in person than in the picture. They really completed my nursery."
2,Non Fiction,"This is a collection of Bob McCune's theories and work from back in the day on how to approach football. It is not that interesting apart from the vaguely humorous style, at times.If you want something recent and relevant, looks elsewhere, if you want to read about the history and what this subject used to be like, this is ok."
2,Easy on the praise!,"I bought this books years ago, read half of it and put it away. During a spell of Football (betting) Fever I picked it up again and I can easily see why I didn't read it the first time.I found the book to be more fun to read the second time I picked it up but I still find it a bit thin on hints and advice.Ergo: A nice read well worth a few bucks but don't expect too much."
1,Lackluster in every way,"I am still confused as to why the author decided to pick Gertrude Stein's home as the setting. This book was about a Vietnamese chef who left his home country as a young teenager, sailed to France, was gay, and that was that. Gertrude Stein was barely a focus to the book (which is why I squandered my money) and there was virtually no mention to the cast of characters who frequented her quarters. The book had the recipe to be brilliant, but quickly deflated like a screamed at soufflé.Supremely boring and written like a haphazard high school biography. Never was there a funny story to read and it was as dry and unexciting as an Afghan rub. You should consider a different book if you want to learn more and laugh about the legendary Gertrude Stein."
2,Boring... But Well Written,"I was supposed to read this novel for an Asian Literature class as an undergrad at UCLA (over three years ago) but I could never get past the first few pages. Figuring I'd give it another chance I recently set out determined to discover why a university professor would select it for her class. Apparently I was right the first time; the only thing that got me to the end was Truong's exceptionally well written prose- the actual plot itself literally bored me to sleep on several occasions. Bare in mind, though, I am not particularly interested in Vietnamese history or Gertrude Stein, so if those are topics that interest you it may be a worthwhile read."
3,Neo-colonial Blather,"There is unquestionably beautiful writing in this novel, but its sentimentality reminds me of many ""Vichy"" Vietnamese I know who continue to glorify the French colonization of Vietnam. For many, the past wasn't so ""dreamy."" The political tone is somewhat naive, especially from someone who is supposedly so well-versed in law. Or perhaps that is the reason. And enough already with the metaphor of homosexual Asian male as receptacle for colonial domination. Please... I find the ambivalence a bit disturbing as well. It disturbs me that there is the possibility of a racist, neo-imperialist, conservative Republican reading this and thinking it was an ""enchanting story"" without grasping its implications. Still, this novel doesn't totally ignore the political realities of the time, I just wish she could have taken it to the next step and made this something more than just a beautifully written work."
2,"Brilliant voice, but cold and dense","It is clear that this book is the work of a brilliant mind, and in its way it is exquisitely written. That said, I found it cold, overly dense, and confusing. The voice of the narrator was not believable or authentic; it was too intellectual and culturally sophisticated. It is the author's voice, and I found it disingenuous to make it out to be Binh's (but many of the observations are amazing!). Also, the reader is ""supposed"" to feel Binh's longing, but the weight of the author's words interfered with that for me. In the end, I came away from this book with a cold, empty feeling."
2,Too Poetic?,"I wish I had a better, more reasoned critique, but the narrative voice for the character didn't fit with the image I had of him. The consciousness of the conceit of an uneducated Vietnamese cook telling his own story in such poetic language didn't fit. It made me like the book less and less as I read it."
4,an Outsider's Voice,"As I read the debates here, mostly about prose style, I have to smile. For me, other than the sensuality of her descriptions, the book is primarily about the voice of an outsider. Someone who, no matter where he goes, is always on the outside looking in. And, I surmise, is most comfortable with life that way. Raised as an outsider to his own family and home by his father, Bihn seeks out one night stands, or dabbles in relationships with people ""out of his league"" with whom he ultimately has no chance. He experiences a moment ""inside the circle"" with the Steins, and the next day gets so drunk as to vomit all over the kitchen, ensuring his place back ""outside"" the circle. Perhaps his fantasy of real, yet unrequited, relationship is the engine for his very apt and sensual descriptions of life and food (check out why love is a quince to understand the point). I found the book well written, and the depth of the character's point of view well drawn."
3,In total agreement with B. Capossere,What B. Capossere posted in another review is dead on. The idea of the book is great but the writing is overly done. The author seems to never have a noun strong enough to stand on its own.
2,Is this the kind of book we should be reading?,"This book is full of things that offend the sensitivities of Asian-Americans. I truly don't think this is the kind of book that we should be seeing published and read in the 21st century America. Please think about it. A gay Vietnamese cook employeed by Americans in France, the former colonial master of Vietnam! Besides all this, it's hardly beleivable that with his limited Franch, he could cook up such array of descriptions. Sorry, the book left a very bad taste in my mouth."
4,a Beautifully Written Book,"I am surprised at the number of bad reviews. This book was a beautifully written book. The language was very sensuous and wonderfully crafted. I can see that for some, it is a bit like Seinfeld - about nothing; but exploring the inner life of this character was a rich experience. There were times that I reread sections just to enjoy the use of words. I felt sad when this book ended."
3,Tiresome plot. A disappointment,"This first-time author is highly acclaimed for this book, and her prose is artful at times. The Vietnam-France connection is promising, too. However, the plot is meandering at best and tiresome the rest of the time. Several times I thought ""now the story will get going and I will learn something interesting about the time"" -- only to be disapointed as the novel devolves into a naracissistic rambling by the main character. Too bad."
5,Brilliant novel!,"""The Book of Salt"" is a masterpiece. The narrative is brilliant and wording highly sophisticated. This book is a treasure to all book lovers. I read it twice. I love this book and highly recommend it to all book lovers!"
4,Salt,"I recommend this title to anyone looking for poetry in the form of a novel. It is beautifully written in every sense of the word. I plan on returning to this book in the future as the first read through was so quick, I'd like to savor it again and again. It is delicate and sad, much like the lives we lead. The recipes and food became a character of their own, and as the first read made me incredibly hungry it also added layers to the story that brought all the characters together. I loved this book."
3,Blame me for not reading the specs,"yeah, i know i doesn't say it has lights but the photo made me think it had... it is UV reactive but has not lights at all. the fan works well, it's quiet and stylish, and comes with a nice metallic grid that retails for 2$"
3,Salt milling,"I had a purchased a pepper mill in a mall store and should have got the salt mill at the same time. A year or more later, I finally decided to get the salt mill. Mall store no longer had the matching one so to the Internet I went. Found the match on Amazon at an OK price... high in my opionion, but cheaper that other places. After a short delay in receiving, I soon noticed that the grain size selection was not staying where selected. Shortly after that the lid broke and rendered the mill useless. At this time I have not sent it in for repair, but it does come with a ""lifetime warranty""."
1,"been there, heard that.","If you're in the mood for (yet another) Tori Amos wannabe, this is the album for you. If you're in the mood for something that will hold your attention for more than three minutes, find something else. There's very little 'new' 'different' or 'original' about Bird York, except a lot of hype over very little."
1,Sucky Single - Buy the Album,"Ok here's yet another rant from a single I have bought and was very disappointed. Sure Frozen and Ashanti are great tracks. There is no argument there, but why pay for a single when you can buy the whole album??For me this is very frustrating. Maybe people here are thinking this is the album, but then again Ray of Light is the Album, which this is from. Is it not??I will certainly be trying to pawn this cd off to someone cause it is useless to me.As an aspiring dj, I am looking for quality remixes that can be played in clubs and stand the test of time. The usual song has been played out by radios, so it is important that it is kept fresh with a good mix.I just can't understand why record companies put out these singles that offer nothing different from the original songs on the album. Kind of greedy in my opinion."
4,"Frozen is good, Club Mix is not","Frozen is a great song and the Stereo MC's remix is fantastic! However, the Club mix is awfull! Madonna's ballads should NEVER be made into dance versions (with the exception of Love Don't Live Here Anymore and WIFLFAG, which are great!) This club mix of Frozen is by far the worst remix by Victor Calderone. I don't know why Madonna keeps recruiting him, all his remixes sound the same! All in all, buy this, if only for the album version! The third remix is OK..."
5,frozen,"This song is brilliant as it is, without even mentioning remixes.However, the remixes on the cd single are exceptional.My personal favourites are1. Stereo Mc's mix2. Extended club mix.But overall all remixes are very good, and this cd single is a great buy. An absolutely must have for any Madonna fan."
5,Great Remixes,"The song FROZEN is a beautiful ballad filled with texturized beats and beautiful vocals. The lyrics are poetic and beautiful. With the remixes, we find it all thrown together into a storm that builds to a crescendo of emotion, which is delivered by Madonna's beautiful vocals. All of the remixes on this CD are well worth the price, FROZEN is a great song to have remixed and these are just worth the money!"
5,My Favourite Madonna Song,"OK So it might sound crazy, but I am not an out-there Madonna fan!, I dont have any of her CD's whatsover, but most of the singles she releases I love. This is by far the most Un-madonna-like song I have heard in ages. This is a beautfiul (ballad) and it has an atmosphere that reminds me of the time when it was released =). The lyrics are great and this is peiced together amazingly. Like A Prayer my other fave apart fom this by the way!, this is one of her best. Its a very haunting ballad that will stay with you all day until you hear it!. I 100% reccomend this haunting amazing song. The music to go with it is haunting aswell I really reccomend you give this a try."
4,It's a really cool song,"Frozen is one of my favorite songs by Madonna, and it's also a good song altogether. If you like Madonna, you will love this song"
5,it's reflet to my heart now,"after my boyfriend of 3month told me that this song look like me a lot,i start listen to it and see my onself thru this song,,,i had a bad broken heart and now i can't let's nobody melt it...i would like to have the lyric of this song..i love it but it's not every words i understand...iam a french exchange student living in ALaska...love the word..even it's totally me..."
4,Madrid: A Cultural and Literary Companion,"This is a well-written book about the history and culture of Madrid. I gained a better understanding of the culture of Madrid and how the Madrilenos live and think. For example, the lifestyle described centering around the cafes and the tertulias (""the gathering of people who meet regularly to converse or amuse themselves"") enables you to visualize life in Madrid during the 1880's. The book is worth reading and instills a desire to learn about Spain's history and culture."
2,Did not work for me,"I was thrilled to find the Tuggy T Post Puller at Northern Tools and tried it as soon as it arrived. What a disapointment. It would not budge any of my posts. Considering another rave review, I must assume the other reviewer (1) had his posts sunk 6"" or less, (2) had a different soil type, or (3) is the inventor of the Tuggy. To give benefit of doubt, I will assume it is the soil type. We have very gumbo-clay soil here and perhaps it works like a dream in sandy soil. Anyway, don't get too excited until you try it."
1,Very bad Trans Mount,"To install it is very smooth, but car's steering wheel starts vibrating after I put this Trans Mount in. I wish it can settle down for couple weeks. The vibrating became constant when I stop to wait red signal. It drives me to decide to order AC Delco OEM Trans Mount to replace this one and it forces me to willing to pay high price for a quality parts."
5,"Luscious, satisfying!","A heapin'-helpin' of nourishing goodness, this soundtrack has enough hearty favorites to please the funkiest R&B palate. Favorites include ""We're Not Makin' Love Anymore"" and ""I CAre About You"" and ""You Are The Man."" The best way to satisfy a craving for sweet, chunky rhythms and heartsqueezin' blues!"
2,very average,"Babyface is a musical Genius and is the best writer&producer over the past decade.on the plus side his one off group Milestone sounds good on I care bout' you.but the problem with this cd is formula.all the songs loop or sound like 2nd tier attempts on the real thing.funny thing Earth,Wind&fire my fave group of all-time steal the show easily with September.the song came out 20 years prior to the songs on this disc.and sounds fresher than any of them put together."
2,Alright. Few standouts (not to many though),"The soundtrack is nice. It's nothing stellar though. There are a few worthwhile tracks such as ""What About Us,"" ""Do It Again,"" ""Don't You Stop What You're Doing,"" and ""In Due Time"" but that's about it. The rest of the songs are throwaway (especially that track with Tendaroni, Babyface -- what were you thinking on that one! ) Overall, I would say borrow this album from someone you know that has it, I wouldn't recommend purchasing it (unless you like this sort of thing)."
5,Agreat hunter of the past,"Stalking Game fron Desert to Tundra is a book I've sought for quite sometime and finally found at a reasonable price. Stories of hunts with Jack O'connor, Charlie Ren and George Parker are enough to give this book a five star rating. The rest is icing on the cake. Along with hunts from the desert to tundra there are hunts in Africa as well. Bound in leater it is just a wonderfull book to add to any libray."
5,Shining and Resplendent Sappho...,"These translations of Sappho are for me the most beautiful I've ever encountered...Lombardo presents each fragment on its own page, and presents them Thematically (in other words, not in order). He has used ALL of the long and shorter fragments.In the Introduction he says that he did not want to use every single fragment because some of them are only one word and thus incomprehensible for poetic purposes (which I also agree)...so in total he presents over 90 of the fragments in the most beautiful and ravishing renditions I've ever seen!These may be Lombardo's most beautiful translations he's done for Hackett Publishing!"
5,A rude awakening,"This book offers and in-your-face approach to politics that is as powerful as it is correct. Machiavelli perfectly breaks down the processes of organizing and maintaining a government, from coming into power to making your position a steadfast one. The Machiavellian approach to politics is nothing short of pure genius, a collection of historical models reinforce all of Niccolo's ideas.Very much a necessity for anyone in politics (of any kind) to read."
3,The Prince,"""The Prince"" used to be required reading in high schools but have since been replaced. It should be returned to the reading list to give students a balanced view."
5,My First (and best) Book,"I was just listening to this week's edition of ""To The Best of Our Knowlege"" about libraries and books. I was reminded that Dr. Goat was the first book I could read by myself, and I would read it every night to my little brother. I went to Amazon to purchase a copy for my friend's baby, and was shocked and dismayed that it is no longer in print. It's a beautiful book, and a lovely story. Dr. Goat takes care of all his animal patients every day. One day, Dr. Goat is sick and all the animals come to take care of him. It's a truly touching story of how we should be treating each other, and what community is all about. (I'm feeling very sentimental right now, thinking of this book I read nearly 50 years ago. How many books have touched you that way?)"
2,sort of funny but.......,"Steve Martin was marketed/managed VERY well in the mid 1970's. His first album ""Let's Get Small"" came out of nowhere and inspired many. His follow up ""Wild and Crazy Guy"" went a step down...some outtakes from the original album, and some more recent live stuff (see my reviews of those if you wish).Then came this cd...which appears to be everything left on the cutting room floor...that should have remained there perhaps. If you are a fan, this is worth having as a collector...so we can hear when his comedy did NOT work.So, if you want to have everything of Martin's...get this. If you only want something funny...then stay away...far away...from this cd, which could have been titled ""Comedy is not Here"""
3,Steve's been Prettier and Funnier,"All of Steve Martin's comedy albums are funny. It's just a question of which of the four are the funniest. If you're looking for his best, they are ""Let's Get Small"" and ""A Wild and Crazy Guy"" (in that order). On his final comedy album, ""The Steve Martin Brothers"", a full side of the album is just Steve's banjo playing (the other half obviously comedy). You'll only get half the comedy you expected on that one."
1,This comedy is not pretty.,"Steve Martin is one of my favorite comedians and his other albums like ""Wild and Crazy Guy"" are legendary, but these jokes really fall flat. I mean really, really flat. Unless you're some sort of collector, avoid this one."
2,"Easy to Understand, Short on Content","Locker rooms stretch info was interesting, the section on weight training was lacking in my oppinion compared to the other books I have purchased on the same subject."
3,ok,"It's OK, but not really what I thought it would be.I am sure it is great for some people but not for me."
5,I been waiting for this a long time ago,Children of bodom is one of my favorite bands since I was a kid not that I'm old but about the same age and this is a great performance althoug I thought that there would we more old songs the show is outrageus
3,Fair,"Alright performance-wise this seems like a pretty good live album by Bodom, but my main problem with this CD is that it's very dominant with the Hate-Crew Deathroll and Are You Dead yet? Material. Being a fan of their first 3 CDs more (I like all of their music but the first 3 are biggies on me), I wish they could have put more onto the setlist from Hatebreeder, Reaper, and especially Something Wild - maybe they could have added ""Deadnight Warrior"" or ""Children Of Bodom"" or even ""Mask Of Sanity"" - I think they could have made a live record with more of their older neo-classical death metal days, but this CD is fair - sound quality is good, but I think Alexi's screams have gone less-aggressive throughout the years. Guitars are great, keyboards sound clear - soundwise it's fine, but I just wish they could have added more songs from their first 3 albums rather than dominating the later days of Bodom. 3 stars."
3,EVERYTHING WORKS EXCEPT THE MIX,"A great performance considering the band is drunk as a muthaf@#ker. The band is spot on perfect. Good editing and great camera work with lots of fretboard close-ups. Great lighting and stage design with lots of flashpots. The whole band performs with amazing energy.IMHO, the only thing that kills this show is the muddy mix. Too many highs with almost no mids or bottom end. The bass drums during Jaska's drum solo sound like someone tapping out rhythms on a coffee table with their hands. COB's studio albums don't have a lot of bottom, but a LIVE Metal show should vibrate the walls. I could barely feel the vibration in my floor at an extremely high volume. These guys need a new man at the mixing board.Maybe next time.The concert was shot in widescreen with a 2.0 or 5.1 Surround mix.If you're a serious audiophile you may be disappointed. I know I was."
1,Not factory replacement,these are listed as OE replacement for my 1 ton dodge. Not the case. They are softer than the worn out ones I was trying to replace. I checked another website and these are listed as OE low pressure replacements for all dodge trucks including half tons for that series. I would not buy these for any vehicle.
1,Not in stock,This vendor advertises as in stock but then sends an email stating backordered... disapointed. Canceling and ordering from another vendor.
3,Good effort.,"This book would have been a lot more helpful in my opinion if it had given more real advice rather than focusing on case studies. At times you feel that the author intended this book to be a textbook for psych students. At other times you feel that the author is using this book to air feelings he had about past clients and past relationships. That's all fine and good, but the title leads one to think that this is a book about personal awareness and healing, and it's not."
4,Rave Music Rocks!,"This album is so good, you got to hear it to believe it. Tracks like ""Living in Ecstacy"" ""Cloud 9"" and ""Welcome"" make you feel like you are in a great underground danceclub. Club music fans and fanatics and DJ's would especially love this. Rave is a lot better than Trance because it is not driven by an empty beat, there are plenty of synths. Get this album and you'll be in the zone. ..."
4,The Saga Continues...,"What can I say about ol' Alex? Well, he's still one of my favorite singers, but this disc shows that his voice has lost some of it's luster, but not all of it!! He's sounds more gritty and growly these days, but somehow it works here. Although it's not filled with his usual smooth R&B; grooves, there are moments (like on MY BABY'S GONE, MARRIED MAN and IT'S OKAY) that remind you of the O'Neal swagger and suaveness from years ago.With the faster tracks (like HE SAID, SHE SAID, which sounds alot like an N'Sync cut) he seems to show that he can flow with the times, but still bring the soul and southern charm needed to make sense of it all. He's definitely done better albums in the past, but this one is very lsitenable with tracks like the aforementioned IT'S OKAY, MARRIED MAN, MY BABY'S GONE, and WHAT IS A MAN? to keep the CD in rotation in your player."
5,How is it?,"hello and high everyone,A O'neal is the man. You just feel the funk and the feelings in his songs. Haven't heard this one yet. How is it? It seems that his best work has been at FlyteTyme."
3,Short of the Mark,"Mr. Cornwell's historical novels are always spot on. Crackdown, like his other modern sailing novels, seems a bit of a pot boiler. The characters here are either stereotypical or too large for life. The plot is unlikely and contrived. Even so, as a sailing enthusiast who loves the Bahamas, I found the book enjoyable enough. Bring back Sharpie."
3,I love Bernard Cornwell's books,"and writing style, which is why this was somewhat of a let-down. It was not a bad book at all. It is just that it was not nearly as intricate a plot or spell-binding as the other books from, for example, the warlord chronicles, saxon tales, etc. It was very predictable and the main character was a bit too naive, but on the other hand this may actually make the character more real for some people."
5,Brilliant Bernard Cornwell - once again!!,"This is well up with his very best - a tale you can't put down. Whether he us writing about ancient days, middle ages, Sharpe;s adventures in the early 1800s, or modern times, you just can't beat this great writer."
4,Great nautical thriller,Enjoyed the book immensely. Being a sailor and boat owner the nautical aspects were accurate and appropriate. I liked Nick Breakspeare‘s character.
2,Broke within a year,This worked really well till the plastic pin broke. My advice would be to buy a pizza cutter with a metal pin (the part that connects the wheel to the handle)
2,Broke Way Too Soon,"It's not like we make pizza all the time -- maybe once a month, at the most -- and yet this wheel broke in under two years. It was very sharp and worked well, but I'm used to Oxo gadgets that last for years and years, not after 15 pizzas.Pick one of the other Oxo models and avoid this one. The plastic just can't take the pressure.Pam T~"
3,Works fine; not durable,"Works like its supposed to. However, after about a year of use, the plastic sleeve that holds the wheel to the handle began to loosen, and a few weeks later, fell right off. Look for one with metal..maybe a few dollars more, but should last lots longer."
4,Another solid OXO product,"On the whole, I have been impressed with my OXO kitchen products. The pizza wheel cuts smoothly and I have no complaints. It doesn't have any fancy bells and whistles beyond that of any other pizza wheel, but I like the soft grip handle and it seems like a good piece of equipment.My only complaint is the size of the wheel. If you cook on a pizza stone or cut on a cutting board without an edge, this will not apply to you, but I often cook pizza or cut brownies in a pan with a raised edge. The larger size of the wheel makes it impossible to cut close to the edge, whereas a smaller wheel might be able to get closer. It's a minor complaint for an otherwise serviceable piece of kitchen equipment."
1,Terrible book,"This book was the most insipid tripe imaginable. The author blathers on and on and on about the most clichéd things, strangely obsessed with his own exercise regime or the exercise regime of someone he knows (I know, weird, right?), as some kind of ""colorful build-up"" to astounding conclusions like ""young people today think living together is completely normal"". Wow! I really needed a book to tell me that! The bar graphs are laughably, absurdly pre-school level. I can't believe any publisher thought this was worth putting on the shelves. Poorly written, with even worse content. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
2,"Too much on God, etc, etc, etc","I was recommended this book by a co-worker and stupid me, I should have read more on the product details, reviews etc. I do not recall anywhere reading about how much it involves the bible and God. While I'm not against it (God), I was bummed that I spent $10 on a book that just preached ""sins of sex before marriage"" etc. It is pretty archaic. I was reading along fine for the first 65 pages (which reviewed all the negative aspects of living together before marriage-or just living together for no other reason). Then when I got to part II -was really shocked when page after page preached the sins of sex before marriage, living together in sin, marriage vows, who to invite to your wedding and a HUGE section on premarital counseling with a preacher. What a waste....this is not what I was expecting..."
1,Shallow little offshoot,"I found that this story was quite disappointing: the plot itself appears to be a contrived cut-n-paste from several different Austen works, the writing style is laboured and rather pretentious, and the characters are inconsequential. Not once in this entire book did I feel more than a curious indifference towards the characters.If your aim is to read a tidy little love story set in the S&S universe, then this might suit your purposes. Barrett does seem know her stuff quite well and that is reflected in her meticulous writing. The story is harmless enough (even though her style does grate on the nerves at times).If you are anything like me, though, and enjoy reading stories that have more depth to it than ""Perfect Woman meets Two Hunks. Which one will she Choose? Eeny Meeny Miney Moe..."" then you might find your time and money better spent elsewhere."
1,totally in error,"This book was so full of a trying-to-hard Austen language that it was very annoying. I didn't get past the first chapter. The development of Margaret seemed fake and not in a way Austen had her heading in her novel. Margaret desired to travel, but nothing is said of this. Something like this would not disappear in three years. Authors shouldn't stray from the original author's intention."
2,Empty Austenism,". . .uninspired and unsatisying. The writing style is Austinesque, but the insipid plot and shallow character development are definetly not. Margaret's motives and emotions are obscure, and the author's assertion that her ""heroine"" has wit and intelligence is never illustrated by word or deed. Quite the contrary . . ."
3,"Ummm, okay.","Of the relatively few sequels written to Sense and Sensibility, this would have to be one of the better ones. It is entertaining, though not very accurate to Austen or S&S. As a sequel, it is horrible while as regular book, it's okay. It would have been really nice to see a greater focus on Elinor and Marianne, who, after all, were the characters we fell in love with. Poor Margaret was always ignored by Austen, and it is nice that someone rembered her, but she wasn't the sister that we cried for or the one that we laughed with. Barret does a commendable job in writing an interesting book, but deserves nothing in writing an Austen sequel."
4,Better than Many,For anyone who loves Jane Austen's works you should give this a try- just remember it's not actually Jane Austen when you begin it. I found it entertaining and it is fun to imagine Margaret as growing up into adulthood. Not quite the tension filled tale of Jane Austen but well worth reading.
4,Two Beaus for Margaret,"I really enjoyed this book. Sense and sensibility isn't even my favorite Austen novel but I loved this sequel. It addresses Marianne's marriage, Elinor and Edward's relationship, the ferrar's bunch, some of the Dashwoods, all our familiar characters. Margaret's character is really developed and intriguing. I loved the two beaus interested in Margaret....they had me fooled for a few minutes. I really was just unsure which one was going to be the rogue. I twisted and turned directions a few times.."
3,Disappointed,I did not like the old english (which was sometimes confusing) and it talked more about everybody else than the third sister. Didn't work for me.
3,Medical Greek and Latin at a Glance by Agard & Howe,"This skinny little book, available in every med school book store from the '40s to the 60's, was a beautiful piece of work. Straight to the point about the construction of those seemingly impossible-to-understand multi-syllable words, the author simply advised students to relax and learn the meanings of all those little words inside the big ones: card- means heart, gastr- means stomach, hepa- means liver, ren- means kidney, and so on. If there's an -itis at the end, you probably have a fever because of that inflammation; -oma means tumor and much more. More elaborate books with color charts and bells and whistles have taken up the store shelves, but none do the job better than this one. Highly recommended and available.Joe E. Holland"
3,A little disappointed,"I love OXO products & usually buy OXO over any other brand. When I needed measuring spoons, I picked these up & was very pleased with them, especially for the price, as they are heavy plastic & good design for fitting into spice jars. I bought a set for my Mom, too. However, after a few months, the markings, which appear to be just stamped on the handles, began to rub off of my Mom's set, & after about a year, the markings rubbed off my set. We both wash them by hand. They are still good spoons & I have no trouble using them, but it is a bit trickier for anyone else in my family to use them since they aren't as sure of the sizes."
5,perfect!!,"i cook alot and these measuring sppons are just perfect,its great the 4 are held together,that way they dont get lost in a drawer!!"
5,Heritage Grains High Quality and Delicious,"My husband was tired of oatmeal and we neededsomething organic, wholesome and deliciousto replace it. Since it's healthier to eat a combinationof grains, we decided to try Heritage. Hertiage Grainscome in flake or cheerio style and are naturallyfruit juice sweetened, so there is no needfor sugar! Great way to start anyone's day!"
4,Heritage Flakes,These flakes are very crunchy (even a little hard). They are not sweet tasting like so many of the national brands cereals. I like them. My daughter adds a little sugar to hers. The flavor is wheat-like but complex. Adding chopped nuts makes a very good cereal great.
1,Too Expensive at Amazon,"Can be found at a brick and morter store for much less. I usually find it on Amazon for less. But, this time, Amazon lets me down. Plus, the first time i posted this message, it was censored, i suspect because i listed the store where you could purchase it for less."
5,Health Cereal,This Cereal is Great for people like Me who are Into Health and Fitness.The Low Sugar and High Fiber is Great and the Taste is Amazing.It stays Crunchy in Milk too!
1,NOT Gluten Free,"This product comes up in a Gluten Free search, but it contains WHEAT and is therefore NOT gluten free."
2,Price goes up but the size goes down,Been purchasing this item from Amazon for many years. It used to be $23.00 for six packages of 39 oz. Now I pay $43.00 for 32 oz. It seems time to switch my morning favorite.
5,Very healthy and taste good,This cereal has great taste and very good for morning breakfast since this has less than 10 g of sugar. I have been hooked up with this cereal for past 6 months.
1,"Well, duh.","This book is - how can one put it politely? - garbage, yes, that's the word. The book has two big messages: that men and women shop differently, and that consumers can buy a particular brand of an item without buying the 'message' that goes with said brand. Well, duh. Hard to believe people get paid for this - and, in the case of Ms Popcorn (real name: Plotkin), paid very well. So don't buy it, it will only encourage her to write something else.In fact, if you still have any faith in Popcorn, I advise that you cure yourself with a quick look at a book by William Sherden called 'The Fortune Sellers'. Pages 221-224 deal with Popcorn/Plotkin. While you're there, check out what he has to say in other 'futurologists' (read: charlatans) like Toffler and Naisbitt."
5,An Attractive and Readable Book on the Pilgrims!,"The lush, romanticized illustrations--in the same tradition as Norman Rockwell--by renowned American artist N.C. Wyeth, are what first draws young readers to this book. While the paintings taken from Wyeth's murals may not always line up with the clear, concise writing of Robert San Souci, it doesn't detract from the narrative.This is a classy book for middle grade students, providing a readable account of the Pilgrim's journey aboard the Mayflower and first year in New England. While the illustrations may be idealized, San Souci leaves no doubt that life was difficult for the settlers of Plymouth.Notes at the end of the book provide interesting and helpful background on the writing of the book and information about the artist, who died in 1945, and the murals that are the source of these illustrations.This is a nice addition for information on New England colonial life, as well as the feast of Thanksgiving."
5,2005 BMW 330CI Oxygen Sensor,"You can buy it or all four(15680,15681,17215,17216)from Amazon for super low price or pay an arm and leg at your local dealer. The difference? There isn't any. I replaced (DIY) all four oxygen sensors due to 100,000 miles recommendation. How much? $392.71 out the door vs. $1,440.97 before tax at my local BMW dealer. I am not cheap when it comes to making a purchase of a good product or a luxury item. I just can't see myself paying over $1,440.97. I had many choices(other online retailers) and chose wisely. I invested what I didn't spend($$$)in MicroFinance [...] to help end global poverty including here at home, my very own backyard called The United States of America. Do yourself a favor! Find the right part at the right price then go for it! Let me tell you,""time and tide wait for no man"". I'm so glad I did!!! Thank you, Amazon!!!"
1,Not Really About War and Soldiers,"I did not get very far in the book, because I was expecting something that at least felt somewhat realistic about war and the people who wage it. What I found was fairly unrealistic ""romance"" about a character whose actions and thoughts were not interesting. Recently I picked upCW2by Layne Heath for 20 cents at a library sale and am enjoying it much more than ""Semper Fi"", so far."
1,Disappointed,As a former Jarhead I thought I would love this book. However the non stop talk about illicit sex ruins the story. He is a great story writer but he needs to stay with the plot.
4,great but maddening,"I love this series and have read it a half dozen times and if I live long enough will read them all another half dozen times. But, . . . the author makes me crazy. He can't remember facts from one book to another, and many facts are insultingly wrong. There was no lance corpral rank in the marines in WWII!!! He should have read the previous books before he wrote the next one to keep things correct because the errors slap you in the face. That said, I will read the series again, and again, and cuss the author under my breath."
5,"If you closed your eyes, you could almost be there.","Just last week I pulled the entire series back out for a re-read. The first reading was spaced out by time and other books. This time, I will get the full effect by going from the 1st to the 8th book without the aforementioned distractions.This will be like a time machine for me. I'll be there, from pre-war China to the Gobi. See ya when I get back."
5,Perfect Summer Reading,"Although i read the later books in the series first, i found extreme amusement in reading this book. There is no question of who is good or bad in this book, which is a nice contrast to the reality today. If You have a military background You should really consider Griffins books before anything else."
1,ALL THREE,"I ORDERED THESE ON TAPE, THEY SEND BOOKS... I AM BLIND.... THEY ALL WENT BACK... STILL WAITING FOR REFUND......"
5,Absolutely Awesome,"I have read many books on the subject of WWII but none have captured my attention like the CORPS series by W.E.B. Griffin. I feel like I could have been frinds with Killer McKoy,Ed Banning or Flem Pickering, and can not wait for the next installment in this series.GREAT JOB ! What a great read"
3,Be prepared to be disappointed,"Book One starts at January 5, 1941 and Book 8 ends in May 5, 1943. From Book One to Book 8 there are 3841 pages. The reading is fast, interesting and one can not help but get caught up with the characters even if some are forgotten . The disappointment starts at Book 9 which jumps to June 1, 1950. What happens in the 7 lost years ? What happens to the end of World War 2 ? Did the author get tired, his best series to date and we are left wondering."
5,I'm hanging around the used bookstore and I,see this book. Having vaguely recalled the authors name and being quite interested in the Pacific as well as the Marines I just grabbed it for a few bucks. It isn't the finest or greatest book I have read BUT it was captivating and enthralling. I was immediately taken by McCoy.I read all ten of this series and enjoyed everyone. Too often the ***********'s of this world don't get what's coming to them at least in books and movies. I liked how they got their due here.Easy and informative reading.I gave the book and the series 5 stars not cause it's great literature but because I was so entertained and had something to look forward to for so long a time.
4,Entertaining and technical read,"Entertaining and technical read. I say technical, because the amount of detail given to the make and model and rank of every character and gun and vehicle is a bit distracting, although I'm a sucker for things like that. Formulaic and troubled heroes, but likeable as they fight through daunting odds to achieve freedom."
5,Excellent Book for this Time,"This book has served as a catalyst to stir the hunger to go beyond the conventional and move into realms few dare to enter.God is challenging His children to move beyond what we can create and build with our own ingenuity and collaborate with Him to build structures, systems, and methodologies that will confound all current capacities.This is an excellent book for leaders Christian or not, who sense a urging to breakthrough the status quo, and function effectively in the unconventional arenas of ones destiny. I challenge anyone to take the time and read this purposefully and prayerfully. You will truly be blessed!!!"
4,A very good effort,"I di not have a problem with the string or winds players, a very professional job. Occasionally the percussion players do not play exactly what the experienced Sibelius fan expects.I prefer this set to the Petri Sakari one, also on Naxos. Pietari Inkinen does 2-7 pretty well, but not the 1st."
2,"Not enough information, some of it very wrong","I'm still in the middle of this book. The subject matter is interesting, but it skims over the tales too quickly (e.g., how and when were Rackham et al captured?). Druett also jumps around too much - mixing the tales of more than one woman who were unrelated in terms of place and time.In addition, the book really bothered me for its lack of quality research. The author relied too much upon myths and stereotypes to embellish her story. In particular, the chapter about the Vikings contained a lot of misinformation, most from romanticized tales from the Victorian era. A 30-second web search would have told her that the Vikings didn't wear horned helmets, that they ate a lot more than plain, boiled meat (as traders and farmers, they had access to a variety of fruit, vegetables, herbs, and spices), etc. They were a lot more sophisticated than Druett made out.It's fine as light reading and a quick overview of the topic, but the devil's in the details."
4,What is this world coming to?,"I'm not much of a moe.head, but I have to say that the last reviewer...y'know, the one that gave this album 1 star...is probably the single most idiotic cretin to trudge this dust we call earth. Rap? Justin Timberlake? What??? Dude, us dopeheads can't figure you out."
5,Perfect!,"I am working on a detox program and needed to stop drinking coffee. I take it before going to work, and Yerba Mate gives me nice energy through out the day. Unlike coffee bean extract, there is no withdraw which I really like about."
3,Not the same as drinking the tea,"I feel like this does provide the internal health benefits described on the bottle but does little else. The tea would really help me stay awake and focused while studying. I never took this and felt like it woke me up or helped me focus. I wouldn't buy it again.I really wanted this to work because it's easier and quicker than making tea, but it just doesn't come close to the real deal."
1,Balance an uneven table,"I read this book, page for page and found it useless. Not really sure you can call it a book, a collection of fun, but not really true trivial facts about California. Once done it went into the trash. I didn't have the nerve to show it or suggest anyone else waste time with in. Other then balancing that uneven table you may have"
2,"Too many ""humorous sketches""",This item is not a favourite in my family. Eight talking skits would be better replaced by an all music CD.However we all love the Skillet Lickers!
2,A pity about the chat .,"Once again a fine example of old time, exuberant music but, with one proviso. The ""humorous Sketches"" take up too much of the recording and are very irritating. If these were deleted we could all enjoy ourselves much more."
4,A masterful study of Biblical symbolism,"This book is a rich study of the ancient symbolism of numbers, plants, animals, geography and much more in the ancient Jewish world. The reader gets a rich sense of how metaphor and nature informed the cosmic view of the ancient middle eastern peoples (Jewish and non-Jewish). Farbridge was a good writer and good at explaining his ideas. This book is well worth your time."
5,She's Hot Alright,"When I first heard ""This Kiss"" on my mum's car FM stereo, I really liked her voice. The lyrics were soothing and highly original, and her singing was superb. Well, needless to say, I'm not disappointed when I bought her single. Faith has the talent to be on my list of Top 5 Female Artists of 1999. Well done, Faith. I love you!"
4,Inspiring & Good Song-especially since I hate Country,"I never have really listened to country, but recently I bought the Dixie Chicks, and I love it, this song by Faith is also a great one, I'm planning on buying the single, because the country that sounds really countryish is lame, but Faith Hill did a good job on this one."
1,The Worst Song Ever Recorded,"""This Kiss"" is, without equal, the worst song that has ever been recorded, in the history of recorded music. The lyrics are assinine, and the melody is nothing short of revolting. Well Faith, at least you have no where to go but up from this one."
5,great song and a sing along.,faith hill sings every song GREAT she relaxes me after a long hard day at work.
5,A necessity for my canary.,"I love canaries, their song fills me with joy. My present canary really has a rough time with his molts. Took him to an avian veterinarian and he gave us this product to try. Helped our canary immensely. This is now a staple for our bird's diet. Highly recommended."
2,Have not seen any improvement in coat,There is way too much in this tub to use in the amount of time as the recommended dose for a toy breed does not use the product up in time before it starts to turn.
4,Beautiful,"Since I love both Enya and the sound of strings, I was excited to hear this CD. I have to admit that there are parts that don't seem completely smooth - perhaps a slight incompatibility of the different styles of vibrato? Overall, however, I was not disappointed at all. The strings are gorgeous and do justice to the flowing, relaxing sounds of Enya's songs. It's definitely worth it, even if you're a fan of string quartets rather than Enya specifically."
4,well then !!!,"Ok, I have ONE question. Why is everyone saying that this CD Sucks?? Yes, the tone could have been better, and there could have been a bit more vibrato in the songs.... Oh well! Also, I was SOOOOOOOOOO Bummed out that they didnt put the song ""ONLY TIME"". grrrr..... oh well.... Not exactly my FAVORITE string quartet tribute CD that I own, but, I still gotta give it some props!!!!! the end."
5,A Combination of the best of classical and contemporary...,"Before I heard this CD for the first time, I was already a big fan of Enya, when her Watermark album debuted in the late 1980s. Since then I have become a big fan of hers and many of her other Celtic, Irish & Swedish contemporaries, like Loreena McKennitt, Charlotte Church, Secret Garden, and others like them, that combine vocal with violin, piano, and full orchestral string ensembles!! I'd like to hear more like this one!!!"
4,Nice change of pace,"While maybe not quite the same as the original versions of Enya's songs, this string quartet offers a nice alternative to some of Enya's greatest pieces. Beautiful blend of strings that have been arranged to sound like the original song but different enough that it doesn't get old."
1,SUCKS!!!!!,"I Love Enya! How could these people do this to her music and call it a tribute..They sound like a tin pan band...And don't get me wrong, I love strings and almost any classical music. But this piece sucks! What an insult to Enya!"
1,Such a DISASTER!!!,Huge DISAPPOINTMENT!!!Awful performance plus terrible recording quality make this CD such a waste. Harsh violin sounds like someone's scratching barbed wires. My 2nd grade neighbor kid plays better than that! This CD totally screws up the beauty of Enya's music!...
3,Missing information,"I bought this to help fix some problems my '99 Buick Century developed, mainly the climate control system. However, this book covers light maintenance at best. It doesn't even mention the climate control system that was an option on this vehicle, let alone how to troubleshoot it. It felt rushed, as some of the pictures/information didn't even seem to belong to this generation vehicle."
1,"It's got a hook, lots of lines, but it's a stinker","This book is great...for about 2 pages. The wacky, edgy character, unique voice and hip slam-poetry format will draw you in, but it won't keep you there. The poetry is bad - the author tried WAY too hard - and quickly wears thin. The plot is contrived, predictable, unrealistic. While the book certainly has its moments and a few of the poems are really, really good, this is not a book I could recommend to anyone."
3,route 66 maps,"These maps are really nice to read: they are simple, easy to read. The only problem they have is that they are too big to be used on the road for me, I am used to avoid GPSs and to use maps for my travels. But these maps are really nice, they tell you what there is along the way."
2,The Route 66 Map Series,"I am a rather disappointed with this purchase, however the fault is probably my expectations, as I thought this would be a very detailed map of the route. I am not knocking the series as it will be a souvenir rather than a working map. I think that a preview should be available so that people can judge if this is what they are looking for. In conclusion I believe this to be a fun value souvenir."
4,Very Good,"Simple, clear and precise. If you love the Mother Road, this is your map! Have no doubt, will take you!"
3,Here It Is! The Route 66 Map Series,It has good information about the old sites but you still have to look at a real state road map in order to find where to turn off of the interstate. Not exactly what I wanted.
1,worthless,"I was hoping for a good close up detailed map of all the twists and turns. These will stay at the house and I will use my own compiled maps (240 pages from Chicago to Seligman, Az.) I'd recommend saving your money, there are free maps and driving instructions with good details that you can download."
4,U.S. Route 66 Maps,"Here It Is. The Route 66 Map Series:The maps are very interesting and provide a very detailed description of the old highway route and directions for driving it.I will know more after we drive the route, using the maps, later this year."
4,Traveling 66,I like the map and would tell people to try them out Thy are also a good read Witt interesting facts
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for maps that would be a guide to the alignments of Route 66 - this expectations was met as well as the descriptions of sites along the way. However i am disappointed by the cartoon-like rendering and the lack of broader context of the alignments - imagine a modern-day road map of a State with Route 66 alignments overlaid as what i was seeking. Unfortunately these ""maps"" are only Triptik* -like in their portrayal of the Route 66 alignments.Also, the paper-stock is not of a folding-map quality. Thus i anticipate that the long-term durability of the collection - if used with any regularity or while traveling - will be limited.I simply suggest that you carefully review and understand the product's features and limitations.* Triptik is a registered mark of the American Automobile Association (AAA) Club. As such it is used only as a reference to the concept of route-only mapping. All rights are solely those of AAA."
4,Step-by-Step,"Good step by step instructions for finding the entire original Route 66 roadway. It's a little weak in the big cities, but well worth the low price for the bundle of state maps. It only illustrates Route 66, and not the other modern roads, for simplicity, so it should be paired with a good atlas or set of road maps."
5,route 66 map,"super map for one of the real world class road trips you can take!go for the trip, and get this map, you will be glad you did!"
3,Will get you there,"...but for those who need to do actual ""trip planning"", other resources are needed. These maps are cool to look at and have good turn-by-turn directions with some recommended routes, but they lack detail (mileage, etc). If planning a family road trip, do yourself a favor and pick up the 66 Dining and Lodging guide, at the very least. There are also online sources, some more useful than others."
1,hated it,"not a real map, kind of just a drawing of what is included along the way no specifics what so ever! might be cool for a momento but i thought it would be more"
3,Route 66 maps,I excpected more off these maps. Expected to be more detailed.I'm not sure if I'm going to take these maps on our roadtrip. Maybe we will just use the EZ66 guide
2,Not as much detail as expected,"These maps seem more like art pieces versus a map to navigate by. The most valuable portion of this map is the text turn by turn details. If you're planning a trip and want a lot of detail look at the ""EZ66 Guide"" by the same author."
3,OK reference,"I don't know what I was expecting, but I was expecting a little more than what I got. I like that each Rt66 state has its own map. But, the quality of the graphics are not up to 2010 standards. If you are going to use this as a map, you are going to get lost. I use it as a reference, but it is not the first or second reference that I reach for. Most of the information can be found on the internet and printed or downloaded to a laptop for the trip."
2,"Route 66, The Map Series","Interesting historically, but not what I wanted. I was looking for a more normal map showing how to make the trip. Barbara"
3,Useful,"Just got back from a month long tour and found these maps useful. Although ther have the appearance of a map drawn on a napkin, the information guided us through some interesting countryside."
2,I'd pass on this one.,"While the maps are fun and have some funky drawings, I would skip purchasing these. Better to get a good map/atlas and a book on Route 66 that tells about the journey along the way - stops to make, towns to see. Best book I purchased was ""Road Trip USA, Route 66"" by Jamie Jensen. Lots of Route 66 no longer exists and this book gives lots of highlights along the way."
3,Route 66 Map Series,"This set of maps is not really what I expected. I assume that they are actually supposed to look rustic or nostalgic, which they do, but leave a lot to be desired as far as ease of use. They do, in fact, give you the true route (?) and ""turn by turn"" written directions, but more map detail and less ""distraction"" would make them much more the professionally made product I had hoped to receive for the price I paid."
5,Perfedt Route 66 partner,"We are going to Las Vegas in June for a wedding and could not think what to do after, having traveled from the UK, we did not want to waste a major trip.In comes the Here It Is Route 66 planner.Most itineries go from Chicago west. We were going west to east, and the maps give detailed turn by turn instructions in BOTH directions, great.Each State has its own fold out map with notes and drawings telling you what to look out for along the way.We have now planned out 12 day trip, with notes of what we want to detour off to see, all from a well produced, informative pack. Well worth the moneyRoute 66, here we come"
5,The Route 66 Maps Series,"The 'Route 66 Maps Series' is a very good product, it give me the idea how is this time the '66'. The charts and the detailed comments of the sections also help me to plan my trip along the '66'."
2,"If you are an average traveller, this series is not for you","However, if you are a stubborn and resolute super 66 Fan, then these mas are of great help. I am the former, so I find they are difficult to read. Maps were hand drawn and not colored, so not precise. I prefer AAA type of maps. When you drive, having these mas are not enough, you have to have other companion guides."
1,route 66 novelty maps,These maps were purchased for planning a trip! not a good idea. they are more like a novelty. They show you the old route 66 with no information of where the new roads replaced the old or any type of info for sightseeing purposes. No info of what town you might be going through either.
3,An Ok choice.. thought better!,"A lot of informations, maybe too many made to fit a single page.. could be better to divide the drawing into a front and retro map...we hope that informations are accurate, will find that out in August. ^_^"
1,Not useful,"These maps are only useful of what you are after is a literal representation of the actual route, ie go 24 miles, turn left at the post office, travel 2 miles, past the hall etc. It contains very little information on the local points of interest, or the history behind each point or the contemporary uses and interests of the region. So if all you want is to have travelled the actual route 66, then the maps may be helpful, but if what you want is to have an understanding of each leg and any history or events that happened there, you wont get that."
3,route 66 maps,"The information about how to get from one end of Rt. 66 to the other is very detailed, but I would like to see more of the ""why"" that all of these places are considered historic. Also, I would like to see the milage/eta written somewhere for each state. I like that all eight of the maps are specific to each state, and it is broken down well in that respect."
2,Garage Band Edits,"As much as I enjoy the bargain pricing of Naxos recordings I find that, on occasion, they can be incredibly disappointing. When I first pressed play and listened to the thundering opening of the 1st symphony I was very pleased...then came the obvious edits. During one movement I heard a [not very good] edit that sounded like some 7th grade punk band with a [not very good] 4-track recorder. The music skipped and came back in and it surely was not a cd defect. I don't think I am being too hard on the performance. The performance isn't really at fault as much as the production. Poor job! If you respect the work of Brahms then please do not buy this cd regardless of the great price. I am very picky about Bach and Brahms recordings and this particular recording is only sitting on my shelf because I can't return it."
4,Christmas present for brother restoring a nova,"He's looked through this quite a bit, and I know he likes it, but I think with today's wiring and other items, its better or easier to go to a muscle car forum online and get advice from people who are actually restoring them, they can help you get around the fact that a lot of parts aren't made the same way any more, some things that used to be a foot are now 8 inches and need rigging to get into tight places.I wouldn't say don't get it, just be prepared to need more help than is offered, nice book though."
5,A satisfied review,"hey dudes, I totally suggest you buy this album! their songs (as are most of their songs) are very upbeat and yet simultaneously deep and just primarily feel-good shtuff.. my fave songs on this album are Running Away, the Fragile Army and Light to Follow. Peace*"
3,"Different, but average","Caught this group on DirectTV and was blown away by the live performance of this 24-member band. Unfortunately, the group is much better live than on this disc. If you like early 1970s prog-rock, you may be surprised that a young group is still doing that kind of music."
2,Quite Overrated,"I'm a little puzzled by the enthusiasm for this band. I listen to this album and I hear a lot of overheated singing and mediocre lyrics with few compelling melodies or interesting sounds or textures. And, on this album, one wonders what the heck they are doing with all those singers, since the chorus takes such a back seat. I did not think this of past Polyphonic Spree releases (which I liked more than this but still left me cold), but this album sounds like an attempt to sound more like the Arcade Fire. Of course, the Polyphonic Spree lose mightily in that contest."
4,"Different, calm, and inviting.","Take it from me this band is simply stylistic and increadably their own. Pick up all three of their beautiful albums. To all you darn haters again...don't judge them for doing their own thing, that is LAME. They sound only like they could and should sound. There are some WELL crafted songs in all three of their smartly writen albums....ture they are not for everyone...but... Why do some reviews call them freaks or weridos just because they don't conform?....I Find that to be the best part of them. Go figure."
2,Low ink...no scan..what a scam this is,"This All- in- one product was bought to be my home office scanner and copier and was doing fine until it ran low on one color ink cartridge. Wow...this shut down the entire machine.I could no longer scan or do a BW copy...nothing!I contacted Epson, and was told they had determined the primary function of this product was a printer and designed ""safeguards"" to shut the machine down if the ink got low.When I stated my point that it's the customer's decision what the primary function would be, Epson responded by telling me that I could purchase another brand if I was unhappy with their product. I was, and I did.Epson charges almost $100.00 for replacement ink sets. Another Epson rip off, in my opinion."
1,Epson RX700 Printer,"The printer arrived completely ruined. It was packed in a flimsy box in circa 35 lb. of finely shredded paper without any plastic bag or any other wrapping around the printer. Every compartment of the printer was full of shredded paper and tiny paper particles and dust. Incomprehensible how any human being could ship an electronic item like that. I really needed the printer.Instead, even with the refund of my money, I am out of [...] for returning shipping charges.The seller really needs to pay that.Since there is no zero rating, I had to five the item a one star. Sorry about that."
4,a winner,nice style at the piano and good choice of material...excellent for easy listening buffs. He is very consistent and won't disappoint
1,karaoke tunes,"while i have loaned this cd to a friend who has found several songs she can sing, i was only familiar with the one song and thought it would have been different.delivery time was excellent"
2,$lob Killer till I die,"This album succed straight up like those forks need to be. THe $lob side was wacc, the CRIP SIDE was hard despite the few traccs, especially K's up, it showed how $lobs get dealt with,only over in SA town, it's Forks Up, Krowns Down. $lob & king Killa. To my eyes dead will never C good, all about the blue atmosphere, so no matter how hard ya'll $lobs say the die-ru side was, I say it still succed. BK till I die!"
2,the crip side was very weak. blood side wasnt to hot either.,"now I'm a crip man, and the crip side was wack. totally stupid. Now I don't like bloods, but if I did I would say the same thing it really sucked also."
2,so-so,"This CD has its ups and downs. The hooks are pretty sloppy, and the songs are barely held together by the rapping. Notables are Bangin on Wax and Shulda beena B-dog."
3,Purchase #2,"I was a little disappointed by the size of, and the labeling (or lack of), for the bubble bath. I knew what it was, but I had to tell the person who I was giving it to what it was."
5,Crowd pleaser!,"Ever had one of those tracks that get you movin and yellin out the words to the track and it feels great to do it at the same time...? this is definitely the track you want to order and have spinning on your tables or just listening to it at home... itll get your body goin and youll feel yourself yellin out the words with so much power that youll probably have a very hoarse voice the next day... so go out and get this track, cause its very much worth the money... later... DJ FunSize...P.S. i also recommend the Richard Humpty Vission Album... Damn that DJ made my day... awesome!"
3,Speck ToughSkin for iPod Nano,"The thick rubber cover was difficult to get installed evenly. Internal friction on the rubber wanted to prevent smooth alignment. I still can't get the function wheel centered in the Speck cover. The display cover isn't all that securely held, and I worry that it may fall out & get lost. The thickness of the rubber along the bottom prevents some headphones from fitting all the way into the Nano with the Speck cover on it. Although the thick rubber seemed like a good idea for preventing damage to my Nano, if I had to do it over again, I'd probably not have bought this."
4,Speck Nano ToughSkin w/ Belt Clip & Screen Protector,"Very good quality,the lens cover is a little tricky to get centered.Overall an excellent cover.A little too expensive however."
4,Good but probably not the best,"I got this case for my nano and I am fairly pleased with it. For $34 I was a bit pricey. It adds some bulk to the nano. The clip degraded rather quickly and I eventually took it off only to find that the clip backing had scratched the back of the nano. The only scratches on the nano are from the case itself, which was designed to keep the nano from getting scratches. The case will keep the nano from fitting into a dock and without the clip it is hard to take on a run. Otherwise I am incredibly pleased by the case."
5,Nano Skin Review,This is an excellent product. I would highly recommended the product to protect your Nano.
2,Can do much better for way less money,"My son had to have one of these. So I bought one even though it is WAY over priced. It takes 5 minutes to put the nano in it and takes way to too much force to put this on. The clip on the back stratches your ipod and yes, the rubber does prevent your nano from sliding around the table top or dash board it but is now impossible to slide into your pocket. Also the screen ""protector"" is a joke and slides around and ironically scratches the screen. It too is almost impossible to install."
5,Impressive,I got an ipod nano for Christmas and after reading reviews about how it scratches I bought one and I am very impressed.The only thing I don't like is it is pretty difficult to put on over the ipod. Overall I give this product a 5. I reccomend this product for anybody with a nano.
2,Speck Nano ToughSkin w/ Belt Clip & Screen Protector,"I purchased the Clear ToughSkin. It looks very cool and is designed well to protect the iPod Nano. The screen protector is great also. However, I have 2 problems with it. For one, it is too expensive in my opinion. And two, the Speck Nano ToughSkin is too long at either end (top and bottom). I have to continually push the ToughSkin up in order to attach my iPod Nano to my computer or other external devices. A real drag. I am about ready to completly remove it out of frustration!"
4,Nano ToughSkin,"This ToughSkin is great. It's very rugged and pleasant to hold. Sometimes I'd be nice if I could remove the belt clip attachment on the back of the skin, but it's okay. It would also be nice if the clear screen protector was part of the solid skin piece. It's actually a separate piece that rests on the screen and you pull the ToughSkin around it. Overall this skin is very nice. I've read other complaints about the skin being too long at the bottom, allowing for poor access to plug-ins, but I've never had a problem."
4,Nano cover,good quality but one problem was that it is hard to get off and on and the screen that is over the nano screen it is making the screen itself on the nano kinda bloury.
3,Great Little Camera,"I'm the novice, my husband's the camera person -- I just point and click. But I wanted a digital just for me, and this is my camera, bought by myself, a major accomplishment. I have a hand tremor, but with this camera, you'd never know it. Photos always nice and sharp. Prior to this, oh yeah! Ghosts galore. Love the large LCD screen. Took a picture of some daisies and everything shows up crystal clear, even the bug on one of the petals. I'm more than pleased."
3,Loved the camera until it broke,"I was very happy with the camera until I dropped it from a height of less than 6 inches and the lens would not retract any more.The surprising thing was that when I called Sony customer service, I did not even have to explain them what happened (so it appears to be a common problem). Sony would not fix the camera for free and wanted about $160.00 to fix it.I wouldn't recommend the camera to anyone, unless they are absolutely sure not to dent it in any way."
1,Sony cyber shot- What a waste of money!,"Two years ago,I received this camera as a Christmas gift from my husband.The camera was great at first, then about 6 months ago the problems started. I can't get the mode to stay on the selected scene. The pictures are VERY blurred or too dark. There is also a delay in the taking pictures.I would not recommend this camera. Save your money!"
1,I'll never buy another Sony product,The service for Sony products is useless and the company lacks integrity. Be careful.
4,Had it for years and still going strong,"I have had this Cybershot for a few years and it's been great. It's small and portable, the photos are nice, and there is no lag. Just last month, I took photos of my son from a distance inside a dark circus tent. He had been called into the ring. Resting my camera on my knee to keep it still, I was able to get good photos that weren't blurry, dark nor grainy. Nowadays, the cameras are getting so thin, I'm tempted to buy another one, but this one performs so well and is so durable that I have no excuse to replace it. It is a good snap and shoot camera."
5,great camera!,"I have owned this camera for over a year now with only minor proplems with it. The pictures are great but somrtimes the shuter speed is slow after you push the button.Also the night pictures are sometimes fuzzy,other then that its a great camera. I paid like $225 for it new and have no idea why they are so much now! You would do better by shopping around for a cheaper price. Jim Thomas Etiwanda Calif."
3,Good pictures but annoying black image problem,I had this camera for less than a year when it just started showing only a black image in the view finder. It also too black images. This only happened sometimes but I've empirically equated it to being below some optimal temperature. In the summer it's fine. In the winter it sucks but if I keep it close to my body and only take it out when I want to take a shot then it seems to work fine. I've heard of this happening with other Sony cameras.Other than that (VERY annoying bug) I find the picture quality to be very good. It does a pretty good job with movies also.
3,Had higher expectations,"This is my 5th Sony Digital Still Camera, and with time, I thought the picture quality, ease of use, and overall performance would improve. Well, not so. I use this camera for point and shoot applications, and use the DSC-F707 (high end model) for more precise applications. The W7 needs lots of careful settings in order to achieve good results. I was expecting good results out of the box. The screen size is great, the video part too (high quality video). Make sure you get a large capacity memory stick to enjoy long hauls of 7 Megapixel picture taking sessions."
4,Great for the price,"For work, I have to take a lot of quick photos, which are put into fancy power point presentations. This camera has been fantastic for that.The pluses:- Quick shutter speed- Great autofocus (sometimes needs to be set twice)- Awesome light settings- Fun light tricks at night- Easy to use- Huge screen for viewing pictures- Lens attachment- Easy to download picturesThe minuses:- Heavier than comparable cameras- Flash is too overbearingI don't have any input on software, since I use Adobe products for my photo editing/cropping and Flcker as my viewer.I would definitely recommend this camera to any amateur that needs to fake being more professional."
2,Blurry and dark pictures,I too have to agree with some of the reviews about this camera. After reading all the reviews I'm wondering if some of the cameras are lemons. When I use the auto mode the pictures come out dark and about 30% come out blurry. I have read the manual and tried different settings but nothing works. I would like to know if Sony is aware of this problem. I am disappointed with this camera. I would like to know if the others that wrote good reviews have taken a lot of shots in the auto mode?
4,Fast shot,"I have had all previos MP models of this camera.I broke two of them. I have bought the third because I like Sony. It is simple, it is fast (one of the fastest cameras in the market, not to shot but to turn it on) and it is the prefect shape.The cons are the blurry pictures sometimes and that it is very easy to break.At a good price is a good choice"
1,Horrible,I had this camera for a little bit over a year and it suddenly breaks down on me. It wouldn't turn on. I tried calling the Sony customer service but they were horrible. I'm going to get a Canon next time.
4,Buena,"La camara es muy buena,pero tuve problemas con ella cuando la compre, creo que como todo,el problema fue solucionado y la tuve hasta que se la robaron a mi hermano, pero bueno hasta que la tenai era un gran producto..."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"I have owned a SONY DSC-W7 for approximately two years. This was the first digital camera I bought and am extremely disappointed. I didn't know how bad it was (since it was my first) until I started comparing pictures I took with that of my friends and family. Many of the pictures are blurry (regardless of the time of day or environment). The shutter speed is slow and I often miss action shots. If you want to count on your camera to capture all those precious moments, buy something else. Do not put a penny toward the SONY DSC-W7; it's not worth it...you will be disappointed."
2,SONY DID IT AGAIN,"Sony Cybershot DSC-W7 is another of the fine products this company provides to the public. Price is right, quality is impeccable and some of the latest technology is incorporated, especially the large screen in back. The camera works flauwlessly, the flash is powerful enough for most shots. For home use, parties, and any event in closed spaces it will be more than sufficient. I highly recomentd this camera as an all around precision instrument for hobbyists and even advanced photographers."
1,Sony DSC-150,"I have what is supposed to be a far superior camera to the one you are showing and I can tell you, it is a TOTAL PIECE OF SH*T. I HATE IT. I have never hated a camera so much. I almost bit it in half tonight, I REALLY REALLY HATE IT. Resolution sucks, screen image sucks, everything about it sucks and when I bought it, I paid somewhere around $500 for it. SONY GO TO BLAZES!!!"
2,papillion2,"I bought this camera to take to a concert. Yes, it's small and lightweight, but the pictures were dark and blurry. I also didn't like the software that came with it so I transferred the pictures into my Olympus Master software. I had to do some major doctoring of the pictures to make them acceptable. I was also unimpressed with the zoom capability. My cheap film camera took better photos. I am thinking of returning this to the store and getting another Olympus."
2,Tint is defective on my camera,"In this camera's Auto Adjustment Mode (for general, all-purpose shooting) the tint level is heavily and overly greenish-yellow. This is especially apparent when shooting outside on sunny days, where there is a lot of greenery (trees, etc). You can make an adjustment in the White Balance mode so that colors are more natural, but it can be difficult to decide using only the viewscreen as reference. Black and white mode is good. Also, the auto-focusing is not always consistent; don't be surprised if a number of your shots come out less than sharp. I am very disappointed with this camera and will think twice before putting down $$$ for another Sony Cyber-Shot."
3,"Overall, a decent camera.",This camera works well using the manual settings. I was impressed with the shots i got of fireworks at night. The only issue I have is it doesn't handle freezing temperatures well.
3,No memory stick included,"The camera is wonderful.The add said there was supposed to be a memory stick which did not come with it. e-mailed the sender, no reply."
3,Not as good as it should have been,"Having been an Esham fan for years, and owning every album of his, this one is a real letdown. I don't feel much effort was put into this album, and it shows. For the most part, it's sloppy, disorganized, and just plain bad. I could only recommend this for the die hard Esham fan, but even so, by default, anything Esham does gets at least three stars, and this one is no different."
4,tounges,"I think Esham is the best rapper ever, except he has too many filler songs. Songs 1,3,6,10,13,14,16,17,18,19,23 &24 are all perfect songs, and 12 songs is almost enough for a CD, maybe with 2 filler songers, but this CD still is a very good Esham classic"
3,"When its good, its good","This album is inconsistent. I am an old Esham fan from Wayne County, mi, and I can tell you, this does not live up to its potential. There is far too much harping on Eminenm here. I dont like Eminem, but enough is enough. You can not make an entire album about just one person. You gotta vary it. Like half the album is wasted on Em, and those are most of the tracks that suck.""walkin on a flatline""; ""I know""; ""so selfish""; ""slippin out amerikka"" Great tracks."
5,"No, not dull... very deep and powerful.","I felt I had to respond to the above comment by saying that this is a masterfully written short story and a moving account of a Master who makes the ultimate sacrifice, whether knowing it or not, to his lowly, faithful servant. The story contrasts well the attitudes and lives of rich masters and their voluntary slaves."
3,Not quite classic Tolstoy?,"I know that Tolstoy was a genius and a talented author. However, this story seemed quite bland to me and I found that it never really ""grabbed"" me in a way that could be comparable to ""War and Peace""."
4,Serves the purpose,"I bought this for my Mom, who lives in assisted living. They needed something like this on the table so everyone could reach instead of having to ask for something all the time. She loves it and so do the other 3 people at her table."
5,I Love This,I bought this for my corner cupboard to hold all my tea's and coffee's. And I love it. With the sides nothing slips off in the back of the cupboard. It turns very easy. I am going to buy another for my spices. It's also large which is one of the reason I picked this one.
4,Captivating,"I actually stumbled upon Unforgettable at our local library. I am thankful I did. The story was captivating early on when the hero, Greg Braxton, and his Search and Rescue dog, Dodger, find a bleach blonde barely alive in a wrecked car at the bottom of a ravine during a powerful electrical storm. Why she is wearing mis-matched shoes begins the great mystery.I didn't give Unforgettable 5 stars for three reasons. First, there seemed to be some loose ends. Some of the babbling Lucky says just after Greg rescues her isn't really cleared up at the end. Second, Lucky seems to vascilate between being super strongwilled (when she cares for the shark) and super meek (when she apologizes for hurting people). Too much of a swing for me. And finally, Meryl Sawyer does a wonderful job building up to a climatic finish, but then leads you through the big blowout scene second handed. It would have been nice to live through all the punches with Lucky.All in all it was a pretty entertaining story."
2,Too many unanswered questions,"This book was okay, except there was just too many unanswered questions and an empty storyline. What was with Lucky's behavior right after the accident, what was with the bleached blonde hair, how did Tony Trayler fall into the picture, why did all these men love Lucky if she was such a terrible person? There are more questions, I could go on and on, but I won't. I started this book hoping it would be as good as Tempting Fate (which is a must read, by the way) but was disappointed. I think I will forget this one."
2,FORGETTABLE,If you like romance with not much of a storyline and little suspense. Then read this book!
3,I wouldn't go so far as to say Unforgettable,"I'm a fan of Meryl Sawyer. This particular book however, is not really her best work. The beautiful girl with amnesia falling for her ""wary of a realationship because I've been burned"" rescuer is certainly not a new theme in the romance department. Even so, the real reason I am ambivilent about the book is that it seems too long winded. Sawyer fans will probably want to read it anyway but if you are not one of her faithful readers, don't bother."
5,Every Parent Needs This One!,This book offered a variety of mix and match options for mission building. The text and drawings were easy to understand. Highly recommended! One of the most useful book purchases I've made.
4,Bianchi still doing what he does so well,"After buying Young Machines last week I have not taken it out of my CD rotation even for one day. While their last long player, Manic Expressive seemed to have a bit more flow in it, Young Machines is more far reaching and harmonious in its exploration of sounds. The first four songs are pure musical ecstasy! Japanese Gum and Meet the Pressure are among the less impressive tracks. Another highlight track, My Girlfriend's Boyfriend, includes what sound like real drums...I believe a first for HSH.Bianchi creates vivid landscapes of heartbreak and clarity that will inspire you while making you cry at the same time.This album is definately a great buy and a must for a HSH fan."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I loved the beautiful ""Manic Expressive"", but this one was a big boring letdown. Remember the Primitive Radio Gods? You know, the one-hit wonder from about 10 years ago who had that song about ""Standing in a Phone Booth, etc, etc..""? Well, every song on this CD sounds like an inferior re-write of that song, with an almost complete lack of melody or invention. The whole time I was listening to this, I kept expecting to hear that same B.B. King sample. (you know, ""I been down-hearted baby, I been down-hearted baby...ever since the day we met, ever since the day we met"") At least something like that would have made this tedious exercise interesting.Get ""Manic Expressive"" instead. It's got everything this CD lacks."
4,Full of useful information,"I found this book to be extremely helpful and very easy to read. It's advice was very practical and made alot of sense. Especially helpful for the beginner gardner, helps plan out longer growing seasons, and planting dates so you don't get one type of crop in all at the same time. A must read if you want to know what plants to grow, and the best way to do it."
5,Pleased Customer,I was very pleased and satisfied with the quick delivery and ease of the website. I will use the site again and will recommend to others.
3,Ehhhh,"I was not overly impressed with the diagnostic tools in this kit. As a matter of fact I replaced everything but the Crimpers, Punch Down Tool and Prep Tool.The Toner was weak and after 45 feet you can forget toning a line out. The Tester was ok just not what I expected.Overall I am sure this kit will work for some, just not someone who uses it day in and day out like me."
4,It's blue,"That's probably the best part of this head. The sounds alright, but I find myself switching on and off with it. I might just need to experiment more, but this is what I'm using most times I play."
4,The Behind-the-Scene Book for the Whole Family,"Though I work on Wall Street, I still hold on to my childhood dream of being a Disney animation artist. This book on Hercules (which BTW is my all-time favorite) is lighter on technical details than the similar books on Aladdin and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but still lots of fun."
3,"Great idea, fun play, but....","It's important to know it's for a cast of 24 characters. I bought it hoping it would work for a total of 6 kids, but there's no way to cut it down that far.If you have a larger number of children as cast members, I think it would be a fun production."
5,Easy to Use !,"""Not-So-Silent Night"" is an EASY, cost effective, children's Christmas Pageant to produce. It's ""easy-to-use"" format allows children to part-take based on their areas of interest and abilities. Parental involvement is minimal and gives children inspiration and freedom to produce their own costumes and props.If it wasn't for the ease that ""Not-So-Silent Night"" presented, down to promotional flyer ideas and caroling sheet also included, I doubt we would have been able to complete our first pageant in the time constraints we faced to the success and platitudes we received. I personally recommend this pageant for any group looking at preparing a children's production."
5,The funniest piece of stand up ever,I have loved Chicken Heart since a friend played it for me over 15 years ago...I have been dying to let my spouse listen to it...the whole CD is a marvelous piece of work! My father has been playing Cosby since before I was born and I hope to instill a deep love of it in my own children!
5,"""Ice Cream, We're Gonna Eat Ice Cream!!""","As a kid in the mid 1960's I was introduced to that wonderful story and song on this majestic album of comedy. I loved it so much that during baseball practice, I would stand in the outfield an ""sing"" that song at the top of my lungs! Needless to say, I was given the nickname ""Ice Cream"" and to this day I will bump into someone that still calls me by it. I learned all the cuts on this album and could recite many of them word for word. Bill Cosby is a very funny fellow, right?"
3,"Lots of fun, but...","Bill is very funny and my husband and I had a lot of fun listening on our 6 hour ride, but I have this on 33 records. The quality of these recordings is poor."
2,Historical Research,"If I were to go back, I wouldn't get this again. Kids might like it; he does a nice job with his sound effects. Very simple."
3,I laughed 'til a laughed some more!,"An absolutely hilarious CD! One of his very best I'm sure. With the ""Playground"" ""Go Carts"" and ""Chicken Heart"" This CD is a comedy all ages will enjoy!"
5,Wonderfulness,We had all of Bill Cosby's 78's back in the day but lost them in one of our moves. I was delighted to find them on cd and to get such great quality used. He is the best!
5,Bill Cosby Wonderfulness,Bill Cosby will always be the best comedy albums. This one is no exception. From beginning to end it is none stop a laugh-a-thon
5,His Best!,"As a stand-up comic myself people often ask me who were my influences and Bill Cosby is definately one of them. NOBODY today can get an audience to listen to childhood stories like the way Bill Cosby could back then and these are some of his best. I can't even imagine how many times he told these stories over and over and played with the wording to get them this good. He was and always should be remebered for his stand-up. For me, for all he's done since, his stand-up was his shinning achievement in the art of comedy."
5,"I always laugh so hard, that... ""the problem is trying to breathe OUT, now...!""","Some of the very BEST from the very GREATEST stand-up comedian ever! I remember that, as a child, this was the first one of his albums I ever heard, and that is back when it was a brand new release! We have always been convinced that Bill Cosby had to be hiding in our closets, listening to us, to get his material! (yeah, that was us!)This album is one that is a MUST HAVE. If you have never heard it, here it is and now is your chance! Every one of these bits on this album will take you back to your childhood! Highly recommended!"
5,Dora's reviews,This CD is classic for Bill Cosby. He is funny and its always fun to sit back and listen to him bring your childhood back.
1,Terrible edition of a great work,"Lysander Spooner -- libertarian, anarchist, feminist, legal theorist, anti-slavery activist, pro-labour activist, and economic reformer -- was one of the 19th century's greatest political thinkers, and his Vices Are Not Crimes is a well-argued critique of what today are called ""victimless-crime laws.""But the Kessinger reprint edition is a disaster. It includes Spooner's footnote markers, but, through incredible sloppiness, omits all his actual footnotes!!! (It also misprints the subtitle of the book -- it's ""A Vindication of Moral Liberty,"" not just ""A Vindication."")Try instead to get the out-of-print TANSTAAFL edition -- or else get the still-in-print Lysander Spooner Reader, which includes this work."
1,Collection of works free,"The Online Library of Freedom, under Fair Use, contains Spooner's works in various formats (PDF's too) for free and available to anyone with access to the internet - then again, if you're reading this, no problem in accessing the Library!"
5,Impossible to put down,Here is a book that has all of the dramatic tension of the Godfather or the Sopranos with the added distinction that it's all true. Detective Cowan bravely infiltrates the inner chambers of NYC's garbage cartel and the colorful yet dangerous characters that he deals with are right out of central casting. The story unfolds quickly as he is accepted into this circle. At one point when his cover is almost blown by a distant relative who is not in on the operation the tension is palpable as Cowan deftly avoids detection.I found this story absolutely fascinating and the writing captures the conversations in a way that puts you right there at the table with these guys. Frankly this is a movie waiting to happen.It amazes me that someone would make such a personal sacrifice and take the risk necessary to do this type of undercover work but at the same time Cowan's tale makes you understand to some degree how a detective can get caught up in such an assignment.This is a fabulous read.
3,Interesting but a tough read,"I'm of two minds on this book. The history of the mob's control of the trash and paper recycling industries in and around NYC are fascinating. But a great deal of the book consists of verbatim transcripts from wires worn by Cowan in his interminable dealings with the mob, many of which are repetitive. Only for the real lovers of mob stories."
5,The New Manners & Customs of the Bible,I am satisfied with this book very imformative easy to understand.Lots of good information. I was pleased with the condition of the book as well and I was satisfied with how quickly I received the book in the mail.
4,Defining Moments(tm) Longline Bra,"It's pretty, and smooth, and soft, and not too thick, and low enough in the back for my dress, and it's shiny, and would be perfect if only it fit. I ordered my true size, and it is way too big"
3,Painful underwire,"The good features on this bra include smoothness, true to size and great width in the back. One bad feature is an extremely uncomfortable underwire. Not a great value, either. But, it did the trick as far as wearing a strapless goes."
3,bigger than you :o/,"order smaller than your regular bra size! mine is too big for me to wear. Sadly, I love it, beautiful, made well, practical, and a fantasic product. No matter how I tried couldn't make it fit. all my bra's fit, all the same size. if I had ordered a size smaller, it would have been perfect! I needed it for a wedding too. if you get the right size, you'll LOVE it! *****if it fits! Does come w/straps also, wear it different ways~"
3,Good but not for me,"I followed the advice here and ordered a size bigger. i got a cup size bigger(D, since C is usually a snug fit). The D was a very loose fit, should have just got my normal size. overall it's nice but is shorter than i wanted it to be. it stops right above where my unsightly love handles start. from what i remember the ones they give you at bridal shops usually meet at the top of the panty line. will probably work for some, but not for me. sending it back and will buy one i can try on first."
4,Lilyette Women's Defining Moments Longline Bra,"I was a bit disappointed with this item because of the thick hem on the bottom of this bustier which revealed through a thin-material A-line dress. This item is not made to be worn under a thin fabrics or fitted dresses. My only recommendation is to buy this item if your alfit is not a thin single layer fabric! Other than than, it does give you a nice bust and waist-line!"
4,Satisfied,"This is a nice product for the price they charge. It was fairly well made, they could have done a little bit better about making sure the boning was secured at the top so it doesn't poke you when you sit down or slouch, but I suppose it reminds me to keep good posture. All in all I would recommend this product, it has very good support and really helps to smooth the tummy area."
3,NIce item,"I didn't want to buy the pricey bra from the bridal store for my wedding, so I bought this one. I am a little concerned because it almost seems too big. I bought my true size(36B) but there are only two lines of hooks. Not like the other bra where there were like 5. Plus, the cups are not very padded. I will need to add something to fill it up. But the material is very nice. It isn't as thick as the bridal store's either."
2,Not for me,I ordered my normal bra size and found it to be too small through the torso (I'm not overweight but I do have a little bit of a tummy). I also found this bra to be too short and I got the dreaded end-of-bra bulge at the bottom. I ended up returning the bra and ordering a different bra-- larger size of a style that was longer.
3,Good Album,"Worth the purchase if you're looking for something to ride too, but don't expect anything special about this one."
2,Ho-Hum,"I'm disappointed too. There are just too many mid-tempo mellow rainy afternoon songs strung together. Nels tries to inject some lively guitar fills but it's not enough to get things going. Glenn must have been bored stiff recording this album.The band and all their personalities may have worked well together during the recording session, but the loss of any real conflict turned this album into a snoozer.I still miss Jay's rambling piano playing."
2,hardly - depressing as hell,"Good for commiserating about how crappy your life is....if it's good for anything?The skill is there, just the lyrics spell out drab stuff. not so much fun."
4,This record makes me feel alive,"I feel lucky. I'm a fan of Wilco--have seen them a couple times, have at least half of all their albums, have heard the rest here & there--I recognize that Jeff Tweedy is one brilliant musician. My luck comes from the fact that I'm not such a heavily invested fan that I have all of these HUGE EXPECTATIONS of their records before they come out. I can just listen and enjoy them simply for what they are--special collections of brilliant songwriting and musicianship. All of them.That said, Sky Blue Sky is definitely a special collection of brilliant songwriting and musicianship. I loved it from the first play. Absolutely worth hearing and enjoying over & over again."
3,Weakest,"Having always felt that a certain amount of warmth was missing from this band (since Being There, anyway), I was looking forward to hearing this when I heard that the relentless sonic lab work was relenting a bit on this album. The truth is, however, that no matter how removed the band felt, there were always very strong songs in the mix on every album. ""What Light"" might be the only song on this album I want to repeat again and again."
3,"Different, but still good","Sky Blue Sky was my first Wilco album. I liked it enough to venture back into Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost Is Born. Those albums were both significantly better, so I dug deeper into their discography (Being There, Mermaid Avenue, etc.). Sky Blue Sky still remains my third favorite. It's a stylistic departure, but not a totally unwelcome one.Occasionally the guitar riffs can go on far too long, but overall this jam-bandy album is good enough that I will listen to songs from it when they are on the radio or television, and usually when one shows up on an ipod mix. I prefer their previous electronic-influenced style, but jam band style is still far superior to their more pedestrian alt-country roots."
3,bring back bennett,"many long running pop/rock bands have had their ""moments"" -- american beauty and dark side of the moon as examples for the dead and floyd and the great albums that surrounded these times. these moments of brillance are the combination of innocence, timing, lyricism, freshness, energy and so on. wilco had theirs a few years back with yhf, summer teeth and being there. not that there's anything bad or wrong with this cd. i prefered the presence of jay bennett in wilco."
2,Safe and Boring,"The album is safe and boring. Technically it is perfect... but the edge I love is gone. It's blue skies and puffy clouds. That's all well and good but its not something I expect from Wilco. All those festival and tour kids who followed Phish... Here's your new band. Personally, I'm gonna file this stuff away for now. I'll break it out in ten years when I have kids and I need a soundtrack to wash the dishes."
2,OK,This album is just OK. There are a couple of quality tunes.....but there is also a lot of filler.
2,What Happened?,"I've been a fan of Wilco for years and, as of this point, own all of their albums. I've seen them in concert once (and greatly enjoyed their show.) So I will feeling a great deal of anticipation for their album. Unfortunately, I came out gravely disappointed. It is not like the songs on the album are, bad per se. Its just that they are deeply, intensely boring. I have trouble getting myself to work up the desire to listen to them, particularly when I still have access to A Ghost is Born, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and Summer Teeth. I miss the old, experimental Wilco and hope that there next album is a return to form, rather than the boring snoozefest that is Sky Blue Sky."
2,sterile sound mix ruins album,"Sounds like Wilco is trying to merge their alt-country roots with the newer sounds they explored in ""A ghost is born"" and ""Yankee hotel foxtrot"". Unfortunately it doesn't work and the album is disappointing and uncompelling even though some of the songs are very good. To me the biggest problem with this record is the overall sound: For a supposed return to alt-country the sound on this album is remarkably cold, sterile and unsatisfying. The music has no warmth and this is largely due to the sterile sound mix. This could have been a stellar album because some of the songs are really great: ""Shake it off"", ""Walken"", ""On and On"" and my favorite song on the album ""What light"", but the album is ruined by the disappointing sound mix."
2,A Ghost is BORED,"this is boring. really boring. these songs, except for the first track, sound like outtakes from the third Wilco album, released in 1997, or perhaps songs that should have been free with a purchase of ""The Wilco Book"". Some of it is okay, though."
5,Shake it off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Another wilco masterpiece is born. A bit of different angle than the last 2 albums, but if your a fan of Widespread Panic or Cream, basically Wilco took a detour from their Pink Floyd Direction and headed west.... which is a good thing....Now all we need is for them to make an album headed towards the Zeppelin/Who direction..=)BUY IT NOW!!!!"
4,Melodic Country Twang,"Plenty of good listening on this CD, with heart and melodies that keep playing in your head. Though definitely rock, this has an appealing country twang to each ballad and song."
5,GREAT,Fantastic coordination of musical themes with the melding of old school southern rock and alternative....LOVED IT!!!
2,review:,"jeff tweedy is getting a little old. too bad. this album is pretty disappointing. it's not bad, but i think my expectations were too high. i'll never get my hopes up again (just kidding, i will)."
4,Nels Cline/Jeff Tweedy Collaboration,"The reason this is different from any previous Wilco album is that it features guitar iconoclast Nels Cline and is more a collaboration between Cline and Tweedy than a Wilco album per se. Cline's guitar playing is unlike any other, totally fresh and original, completely non-derivative. That being said, there is a Beatle-esque undercurrent to Tweedy's songs and the CD sounds like something the Beatles could have released in 1977 if they had continued recording and evolving that long. Tweedy and Cline collaborating is something like Rembrandt and Salvador Dali collaborating on a painting but somehow they make it work. This is a very good CD that may take several listens to grow on you so don't give up on it if it does not hit you all at once. If you are a guitar player of any musical style, Cline's playing is not to be missed!!"
2,Great aid for sleeping disorders,I give this new Wilco album credit for being so helpful with my insominia. I can play this album and get the best sleep I have had in months. Thanks Wilco! I have been a great fan of Wilco from their first albums and up until the last two had great music value so I'm glad to see they are going for the customers who need sleeping aids now.
3,They've got it and then they don't.,"They've got it and then they don't. And then they got it, and then they don't....Oh, they got it and then they don't. They've got it and then they don't. And then they got it, and then they don't....Oh, they got it and then they don't. They've got it and then they don't. And then they got it, and then they don't....Oh, they got it and then they don't. They've got it and then they don't. And then they got it, and then they don't....Oh, they got it and then they don't.Maybe that is why Wilco has never just exploded widely over the world. For example YHF, I love and would rate it 5 stars on the first 6 songs alone. After that, the next 5 songs I am not sure I would even recognize them. I would be like ""oh, cool wilco put out some new tunes"".Same with A ghost is born, I absolutely love some of those songs then others,.... eh'.This new cd has not yet caught my ear yet, after 3-5 listens maybe 3.5.>>>---Zen--->"
2,Wilco's a little uninspired this time around,"I'm a Wilco fan. I bought ""Sky, Blue Sky"" the day it came out. There's been a lot of good ink in regards to this cd and I had hoped it would be a step up from ""A Ghost is Born"" (which had the disadvantage of following ""Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"") but it just isn't. Right now I'd say it's a step down. I'm not going to tear this cd apart because Wilco is a great band and should be allowed to struggle and falter. Simply, the main problem is that it sounds like they just couldn't find any inspiration with these songs but decided to release it anyway. They just don't have the clever, well-crafted, ingenious ""x-factor"" that marks the bands best material.I will say that now, more than ever, Wilco seems to really be The Jeff Tweedy Band. That might not be a such good thing. Wilco might need a little give and take, a little tension added back into the mix to fuel the creative juices.This is a 2 1/2 star cd. It won't stop me from buying their next release."
5,Amazing,"Personally I haven't heard an album of this quality in a long time. The last albums to do that for me were Nirvana Unplugged and Elliot Smith XO. The music really stays with you. It is refreshing to hear something so melodic and sad and uplifting, all at the same time. They created something special with this album. Songs 1,3,8 and 9 are classics. The whole album is strong start to finish."
5,Another solid Wilco record,"I think this is a great disc. But I liked Ghost better than Yankee and I am a huge Jazz and Nels Cline fan who after watching I Am Trying To Break Your Heart thought Wilco is better off without Jay Bennet anyways, so what do I know.A lot of nice songs on this with great performances by everybody in the band. Fans of early 70's rock and John Lennon should love this."
5,"oh, wilco","wilco has a tendency to create wonderful albums that really grow on you. first couple listens i was rather underwhelmed by sky blue sky... but as with all the wilco albums i own (and for that matter most great albums i own) it takes a while to get into it and really appreciate it. sky blue sky is a mature album by a mature band... normally rather mellow and comtemplative, but many moments that remind you how good a band wilco really is. highly recommended."
3,A Letdown,"Wilco seems like a band that is lost. I was eagerly anticipating this release, especially after the surprisingly good ""Live In Chicago"", but it seems to lack the wit and energy of their previous releases. I am probably one of the few who really liked ""A Ghost Is Born"" (it's like a fine wine- it gets better with age!), which had some very energetic and creative tunes (""Handshake Drugs"", ""Hummingbirds""), something that is sorely lacking in ""Sky Blue Sky"". Sadly, SBS actually put me to sleep! All the songs sound similar; none really stands out. That being said, I gave it three stars because: it's Wilco, and even a bad Wilco release is better than most everything else that is out there; the instrumentation is just wonderful, these guys actually know how to play their instruments; there are flashes of new sounds and styles, as the tone was more bluesish and jazzish. Here's hoping that this is is just an anomaly and not an indication that Wilco has slipped into mediocrity."
4,"Summer of ""Sky Blue Sky""","Wilco returns to the sweet, country-tinged sound of their early work on this release. Fans of YHF and Ghost may lament the absence of the sonic experimentation that worked quite well on those albums, but the band recognized that they would have sounded out of place here. What we have instead are 12 well-written, expertly executed performances that mirror vintage pop but still manage to sound cutting edge. ""Sky Blue Sky"" could have easily been released in 1977.And how about Nels Cline? His playing may be a bit exaggerated at times, but he's a perfect musical foil for Jeff Tweedy's plaintive style. This album is indeed the perfect soundtrack for warm summer evenings."
5,A Band Is Reborn,"Worst album by Wilco?? Come on!! Sorry there's no drug/pain induced lyrics...no hidden meanings...no 15 minute repetetive songs...if you want abstract, A Ghost Is Born this is not...even Jeff Tweedy himself said he didn't know if he could perform those songs once he cleaned up...fortunately the songs became alive again through sober eyes and ears and they had whole new meaning for him...which is where ""Sky Blue Sky"" is...eyes opened, ears listening to the world outside the door...it's beautiful, and the best damn thing to come out in years....BUY IT!!!"
2,It's OK. I bot this because a co-worker recommended it (bad idea),"Bot this on the recommendation of someone I work with and THOUGHT I shared similar music taste with. Don't get me wrong, it's not HORRIBLE... but it will likely gather a lot of dust on my shelf (I definitely have to be in the mood, or something, before I'll listen to it)."
3,loose fur anyone?,"amazing to me how everyone here is a 'huge' tweedy fan yet the best thing he's done since YHF, Loose Fur's Born Again in the USA has only gotten 8 reviews and it has been out exactly a year.This album has been out for one day and has 32 reviews already. Born Again is pretty much the same band as Wilco and let me tell you: it crushes A Ghost is Born and possibly crushes this album but it is way too early to review Sky Blue Sky. Can't believe anyone can actually write a review and think they know this album yet. Sky Blue Sky could be Tweedys Suicaine Gratification.. lets hope not.Buy Born Again if you want a great album start to finish that you don't have to try so hard to like.Disregard my star rating because it is too soon to review SBS."
2,In a Word: Dull,"Lots of people became excited upon hearing that Wilco's newest recording would be somewhat of a return to their more traditional roots-rock origins. Count me among them, for although I eventually warmed to the ""Summerteeth"" to ""Ghost is Born"" sonic progression, I missed simple pleasures like ""Passenger Side"" from their debut album.That said, ""Sky Blue Sky"" is a huge disappointment. Whether Jeff Tweedy and company decide to dress their songs up with sonic flourishes is irrelevant if the songwriting isn't terribly compelling in the first place. ""Sky"" is a tepid folk rock album which contains not a single memorable track. It slides along pleasantly, and then fades from memory almost instantly. Too bad. The horribly mediocre American rock music scene sorely needs Wilco to be at the top of their game."
2,Boooorrrrriiiiiinnnnnnngggggg,"this is a very slow, dull album. the kinda thing that you may expect from james taylor or something similarly lame. this band is too good to be so tepid. save your $."
1,Seriously flawed and misleading.,"Rather than being a popular, innovative work for the general reader, this book is misleading. Mr. Johnson is quite creative, but his ideas lack any firm basis in classical studies or biblical studies. Instead of revealing secrets of Greek myth, he is instead creating new myths from whole cloth. Apart from having no apparent credentials or practical experience in classics and no peer-reviewed publications in the field, Mr. Johnson formulates what are effectively conspiracy theories that lack logical integrity; I am a non-professional, but even my avid amateur pursuit of ancient mythology and archaelogoy reveal the serious flaws in his books. I apologize to anyone who has been deceived by his work. In their place, I would respectfully recommend works like Mary Beard's excellent work for general readers ""The Parthenon"" or the somewhat denser ""The Nature of Greek Myths"" by G.S. Kirk."
5,Athena and Kain: The True Meaning of Greek Myth,"ATHENA and KAIN is a superb read, a thoroughly enlightening experience. This book and Mr. Johnson's previous one, ATHENA and EDEN: THE HIDDEN MEANING OF THE PARTHENON'S EAST FACADE (which I have also read), are changing the way we think about the ancient Greek world. For the first time, Greek myth has meant something to me. I always knew that it connected somehow to the broader history of the human race, but I couldn't see how. Now I do.How quickly these books catch on in schools and among the public is anybody's guess. But I wonder: when we get to the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, and the media begin to speak about the Parthenon and other cultural treasures, will they understand what they see, or will they simply ""ooh"" and ""aah"" at some old Greek stuff somebody told them was important?"
1,bad,"Worse product ever, I got this after reading the reviews. I followed the instructions to the letter and it made my hair so dry and worse than any relaxer I used before. It is the last time I am buying this product."
1,horrible!,horrible product . did not work at all . my hair was as wavy as before. absolute waste of money !
2,Where is my order??!!,"""I have not received my order, and I have not received a response to my email... I will file a claim w/ my credit card if I don't hear from you! PLEASE respond!"""
1,Defective product,"Product arrived missing most of the required straightening product, so it was totally ineffective. I have purchased this product elsewhere and really love it, but the product that I ordered on Amazon was totally ineffective as it was missing most of the product necessary to straighten your hair."
2,"some difference, probably wont repurchase",My hair is curly and frizzy. I followed all the directions. Even called in to ask a few questions. However the product left my ends dry (which are ombre colored) and the curl is about 10 to 20 percent less. Not what I expected.
1,waste of time and money,Didnt work at all. And it smelled. From now on I'll leave it to the real professionals and just go to the salon.
1,Many steps to follow,"I was so afraid to try this after so many bad reviews.You must blow dry the hair after applying the straightener, then apply the nuetralizer. I initially liked the texture but then it just turned all frizzy and worse than my hair would even be without any straightener.I have used Ogilvi3 for like forever and know it can be hard on your hair, and hope this would be a good alternative. Remember all straighteners are hard on your hair, but I don't care to be even more frizzer than I was before!"
5,very good,"this might be the best album since the brown one from the band !!buy this one, if you like the band dylan gourds neil van etc."
3,Dare,"I missed the detailed description of Archy's dress, his meals, and his Marc and English Oval at night in his room. Also, his policeman friend, Al, was hardly around in this book. The plot was good and kept me interested but it seemed to lack the personal details and daily routine of Archy that makes this series so good."
4,"Good, but not great","Lardo is changing McNally's style, in sort of the way Roger Moore changed Sean Connery's version of James Bond. In other words, it gets a little too silly at times. But the story is interesting, involving a rich young man from Switzerland who may or may not be who he claims to be. Another young man ends up dead in a swimming pool at a party, starting the mystery. At one point, McNally is working for three clients at the same time, which I thought would develop into more conflicts of interest than it did (seemed like a lost opportunity for the author). The drama of the second pool party was one of the best parts of the book. Especially when McNally started to count toes."
3,lardo's true style coming through,"i just finished mcnally's dare this week. i have read all the books in this series and all of lawrence sanders work. this book has lardo writing more in his own style, rather than that of sanders. it seems to me that he is not quite the same as sanders in description writing, however he has done a fine job of plot and carry through. i will forever miss the vivid and textured descriptions that sanders gave the reader, and fervently hope that lardo will keep archy dressing with savvy and eating the fabulous concoctions by ursi at the mcnally manse and the pettibones at the infamous pelican club"
1,Deceived,"Have enjoyed many of the books by Lawrence Sanders.I had not realized he had died in 1998. I purchased ""McNally,sDare"" because Lawrence Sanders' name was so prominentlydisplayed on the cover. Looked great, I haven't read him inyears. I know now why, and think it is intellectually dishonestas well as a cheap ploy at the expence of his name.I will admit it was my mistake and one not to be repeated.I only made it through a couple of chapters to realize Mr. Lardo is no Mr. Sanders and probably explains the deception.I won't make that mistake again."
1,For Shame...,"This is a compilation of short gothic (in this case, read: dull & simplistic) ghost stories. Practically all of them set up a weak plot that is never followed through. Invariably, all of them are presented with a weak and sometimes absurd premise, to then be cut short 5 pages later with no closure whatsoever. Don't expect thrills, or much less chills from this book. There is one sweet story, Dust Motes, but for 10 pages, keep your money in your pocket."
4,pretty good buy. worth the price,"the sheath is pretty cool but it has its problems. unless it is verticly strapped on you the machete that is sold seperatly wont go in clean. it will get caught toward the bottom where you see that plastic tip. also, one of the times i unsheathed the blade the newly sharpened blade cut the sheath a little. 5 minets of sowing fixed this problem and it hasnt happened again. i ges if you were more carefull each time after you sharen the machete then you wouldnt be faced with this problem."
1,Weird,"I'm a little confused about thisProduct FeaturesIt is a machetteIt comes with the feature Polypropylene HandleAlso with Cordura SheathIt comes qualityAfter i read this, i thought a machete and a sheath are included, but what I received was only the sheath, was it mistake or this item have the sheath only?"
4,"Well, hi, boys and girls!","Bob Newhart's first album was million selling smash. Each one of his subsequent albums sold less copies than the one that preceded it. This was Bob's third album. It is very funny, but most of the material is pretty dated. Who remembers Herb Philbrick nowadays? And the bits about Nikita Khrushchev and German rocket scientists are dated, too (but still funny). My favorite routine here is ""The Uncle Freddie Show"", which is a hilarious bit about a local TV kiddie show. It's worth the price of the CD just to get that routine, but the other routines are funny, too."
3,Not as memorable as the last two!,"The first two Bob Newhart albums I listened to for days, and couldn't stop laughing. This one however shows Bob was losing his touch a bit when it came to audio recordings. The final sketch has Bob Newhart admitting that his voice was ragged. On the basis of the entire album, that is definitely true. Only get this one after you listen to the first two, which are ultimate masterpieces!"
2,Hoping the next one is a bit better,"What if death, time, fate, war, nature, evil and good were not mere concepts but offices held by actual people, like any other occupation?When Mym, the son of a rajah, grows tired of his father's manipulations in his relationships, he opts out of his life in order to become Mars, the immortal Incarnation of War. In this new position his job is to supervise the significant warlike activities occurring in the world. Although he's morally opposed to such needless violence and suffering and initially hopes to use his office as a means of alleviating and lessening the destruction and misery war causes, Mym reluctantly comes to accept that war is a natural and fluctuating, if unpleasant, state of humanity.Like the few preceding it, Wielding a Red Sword doesn't quite hold up to On a Pale Horse, the first book in this series. As usual, the characters are painfully two-dimensional."
4,Deffinitely the middle Child,"It's obvious that this was the middle book of the series. While ver good, it seemed a little lacking compared to the others. Mym though, is an incredible character and, like with the others, you are drawn to him and come to truly care about his welfare. War is terrible, but this book puts a new spin on the 'office' and helps the reader to understand that this position that Mym has taken is not simply about death and destruction--love is as much a battle as is war.While this is a stand-alone novel, much like Anthony's other series books, I highly suggest reading this one begining to end--it will help with understanding some of the later books, as this is one series that is incredibly interwoven."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"War is necessary, someone has to be in charge.The fourth Piers Anthony book in the Incarnations series is perhaps a little different in tone, given that wars are not all that fun, so if you are in charge of them and aren't the Evil gloating supervillain Ares type that Wonder Woman and Xena have to deal with and maybe beat up at various intervals throughout their history."
3,"Interesting, but only if you like the series.","This book wasn't bad by any means, but it lacked the awesome plot themes of ""On a Pale Horse"" or the intrigue of ""With a Tangled Skein."" The story was mildly interesting, the office was rather boring, but the characters were (as usual) well developed and deep. If you like this volume, you'll love the rest of the series. Read it only if you are really interested in the series."
2,i think the first book was the best,"i must say that i read this book out of desire to complete the series. mars is an interesting character. but it is rather disappointing story actually.it begins with mar's life as an escaped prince then drifting to the women he becomes involved with. the style of writing was rather dull and plodding to me. *sigh*the plot picks up in the second half of the book when satan enters the scene again. i found little of the ironical homour i enjoyed in his other books but overall the book was neither here nor there, neither good nor bad.if you plan to read this series, begin with thanatos' story in the book 'on a pale horse'. now that was a excellent book..."
3,Doesn't stand up over time.,"I think I expect more out of Fantasy anymore. I remember really liking this book when it was new. Looking for something to read on a plane, I downloaded this book and boy its just not that good. Very predictable. The scenes in no way stand up to Jordan or Tolkien. There is no way this is a 5 star book. Its OK, so I give it a 3, but its really a teen age boy 3, not a full out 3. Lots of T&A for no apparent reason. I guess it fills up the pages."
3,Not Roger's Best,"I like Roger Creager and consider myself a fan, however, I do not think this is his best album. He still has that ""Roger"" sound on this album, but to me it just seemed like something was missing. I would look to get some of his previous albums before getting this one."
2,Disappointed,"I have to say that I am severly disappointed in this CD. I was expecting a lot more out Creager, especially considering the other two records. Gone are the powerful fiddle solos and catchy tunes, and they are replaced with what sounds like elevator music. If I wanted to buy elevator music, I would buy Kenny G not Roger Creager!! Although despite the mostly bad review, there are a few good tracks. There is a track which can best be described as cajun meets country music, that sounds really good, and there is also a quite funny track about a girl from Shreveport to New Orleans."
5,One of the greatest computer books of all time,"Python is a fast and easy to use language, though learning how to think in python, especially if coming from a more c-style language can take a while regardless of what book you're reading. This book won't help you with that. What it will do, is provide you with most (if not all) of the most-advanced features of python in a way that is really easy to digest for an intermediate/upper-beginner level python programmer. This book explains things that are not easy to find on the web or not apparent that they even exist in python (because, let's face it, python can be pretty magical at times). This book can be the catalyst that puts you well on your way to becoming an advanced python programmer. And all that from a tiny reference book!"
3,It has no index!,"I concur with the other reviewers that this book contains useful information but IT HAS NO INDEX, and FINDING that useful information is non trivial.What were O'Reillys thinking? If a third edition ever appears, and if it has an index I'd be glad to buy it as the book does seem to pack a lot of information into a small compass."
3,If you know C++.,"Jargon filled, many references to other languages; if you know what you are doing is is probably a good book.Check out INVENT YOUR OWN COMPUTER GAMES by Al Sweigart if you want a more gentle learning curve."
3,Good for introduction,"This product came on time and it had a good condition. if you are looking for more details, you should buy a textbook because This book is a reference."
5,THIS SONG MADE ME THINK ABOUT THE SIYUATION I WAS IN.,I THINK AaLIYAH IS A EXTREMELY TALENTED ARTIST. THIS SONG ESPECIALLY MADE ME CRY. WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS SONG I WAS GOING THROUGH A RELATIONSHIP THAT WAS DEALING WITH THE SAME PROBLEM. IT COMFORTED ME. HER WHOLE CD IS JUST ON POINT. THE BEATS ARE DEFINITLY KNOCKING.ANASTASIA
2,Good if you want to reinvent the wheel!,"This book is good if you want to start policy-writing project or want to do PhD in policy writing. In today fast moving world, you want best practices for the most commonly used polices, which you could review and quickly deploy.I think ""Best Practices Information Security Policy Manual"" by PacificIS is better choice. It is simple, direct and of right size i.e. 50+ pages, it is ready to use in word format. As you know, if my organization publishes a policy manual of 700 plus pages no one will read. Other very useful resource is Charles Cresson's Information Policy Made Easy with 1300 policies on 725 pages. However, I find it more difficult to select from 1300 polices which are more of academic nature. It also requires lot of editing and customization. I would love to follow it if my company assigns me a project of 3-month just to write a policy."
1,Victorian Heraldry on its Best... and Worst,"A set of over 4,000 crest designs, but what a disappointment! The true heraldic craftsmen drew their inspiration from true heraldic sources, i.e. the Middle Ages. After 1600 or so heraldry went into a steep decline, culminating in the truly awful Victorian concept of depicting the 'real' thing, as opposed to the brutal and wonderful power of the symbolic art of earlier craftsmen. Thus we're stuck with 'real' lions and dragons and any kind of object, complete with shadowing. Well, the book was published in 1859, so I should have known better.... If you're interested in Victorian heraldry, it's a wonderful book. If you're interested in real heraldry it's a waste of money. Try the compilations of Sir Anthony Wagner instead. Now t h a t is true heraldic power."
3,"resource book for designing new crests, not finding old ones","This book includes hundreds of components of potential crest designs shown in black and white on plates. It does not include any family names, family crests, or or any type of index to the images included in the book."
2,Without Blazon or Reference,"Moderately useful, but all of the images are Victorian era lithograph in style, and have lost a lot of whatever flair they might have had. Color was not expected, but without blazon (heraldic description) or any other reference other than plate number, only the images are of any use. There is no table of contents, and although the images are grouped according to their central character (lion, tree, etc.), that is the extent of it. There is some mention of another archive, but not in a complete context. Hunting for it may be more of a chore than throwing your hands up and finding something else. I'm not even going to try. Also, since the images are in roughly the same style, an estimate of time period or place from one's own judgement of history is nearly impossible.Still, there are a lot of images, and by themselves are inspirational to some extent.Overall, not a complete waste, but not worth it, either."
3,"Long and rambly in parts, but ""Buck Buck"" is great","The problem with a grat deal of this album, as is the case with much of the Cos' later work, is that many of the routines on this CD are too long and rambling. However, ""Buck Buck"" is the price of admission in itself! A true classic, this is the routine that introduced the world to Fat Albert.Several years later, this classic routine was recreated for an entire episode of ""Fat Albert"" (""Hey man, these guys got rocks in their pockets!""). To those of us whose introduction to the Cos was the Fat Albert cartoons of the mid-70s, this CD is a revelation and will bring back fond memroes of at least a couple of Fat Albert episodes (as was the case with ""Tonsils,"" Chicken Heart,"" and ""Go Carts"" from ""Wonderfulness."").BTW, You might wanna use a disclaimer with your kids and tell them that they're not supposed to play ""Buck Buck"" in real life, as we got in trouble for trying this as children."
5,"Bill Cosby is ""Smoking!""","Revenge, Smoking, 9th Street Bridge and Buck Buck are my favorite tracks on this CD. The other tracks are OK. I grew up listening to Bill Cosby and his childhood stories are woven in with my own memories. Few things I remember as clearly as listening to Bill Cosby with my brother and sister. It was not too often that we would have fun together - but listening to Bill Cosby tell the stories of his childhood stopped our bickering and brought us together for a short time. And of course we could watch the stories come to life every Saturday morning on the cartoon FAT ALBERT.Revenge, has one of my favorites, ""Smoking."" As the oldest and first to try everything - Smoking - brings back my own memories of trying 'be cool' in the early 1970's and enables me to shake my head and laugh at myself.Don't miss out on this great live recording. Suitable for most ages."
5,If Lloyd Kaufman directed the Wizard of Oz . . .,"This is the book to get if you loved the Wizard of Oz during your childhood and your tastes have become intensely more deranged since then.The book is a heck of a lot of fun. Along with me, Ranalli is part of the bizarro movement in fiction. It's comprised of authors doing some very strange things with literature. But above all, it's about entertaining the reader. And in a world where television, movies, and video games are king, this is a difficult feat. CHEMICAL GARDENS shines through.Ranalli's strength lies in all the surreal elements of the book. She pulls off some incredible things here. Check it out!"
4,Alice Meets Dorothy in the Seattle Underground,"This is the third book by Gina Ranalli that I've read and each one is totally different--straight-up, in-your-face apocalyptic horror (""Unearthed""), zombie story with some original twists and tweaks (""Praise the Dead""), and this little Alice-meets-Dorothy bizarro punk-rock homage, which is simply wonderful, an imaginative and tightly wound tale of weirdness involving a punk band, demons, gender bending, cherub bodyguards, giant killer rabbits, and one bad-ass 10-foot-tall Metal Priestess.Bizarro fiction is often hit or miss for me, but Gina Ranalli's storytelling skills and creativity really shine in ""Chemical Gardens."""
4,Easy and Relaxing,I really loved the simplicity of the writing style and the weird imagination... made for an easy and relaxing read.
3,Maybe I was expecting something different....,"I have to say that 3 stars may be a bit generous here. I can not begin to describe how let down I was Wizard of Oz elements started to appear and then how disappointed I became when I realized this book could essentially be called ""Wizard of Oz: Punk Edition"". Don't get me wrong some of the twists are pretty clever and do make me chuckle a bit, but all in all, the fact that this book is such a mirror image of Wizard of Oz makes it a boring read. I felt that there are many, many opportunities in the plot of Wizard for Ranalli to really explore and play with but she plays it safe and just takes and twists the story in a very predictable dark and punkish way and does not truly commit to making the story her own."
3,Lost in space,"Anyone who is interested in what it will take to get the United States back into space will find an interesting and well thought out answer in The Return. The story (which is fiction) tends to wander between courtroom intrigue, nostalgic family drama and techno thriller. Unfortunately none of these really conclude in a satisfying way. In the end the book becomes a great advertisment for Dr. Aldrin's company Share Space without ever becoming a great book. It is a fast and easy read at times exciting with the technical side explained in simple terms. A pleasant way to spend some summer reading time."
2,"Started Well, Downhill From There...","I enjoyed the beginning of this book. It started with a bang, and then just sort of fizzled out for me.The background, the launch and the ""accident"" I found interesting. It was the tedium of the aftermath that I found dull. The lawsuits, the guilt, the lawyers, that followed...yawn.I had high hopes for this book and was let down."
1,Avoid!,"Nothing happens! There is no Return to anything! Other than a few launches of satellites towards the end. You have a group of people who were young and suppose to do all these great things to get man into space and at the end of the book...you still have that ""oh ya, we were going to do that weren't we?"" then the book ends! Usually when I own a book - I keep it. I NEEDED to sell this to a used bookstore in the hopes that it would not leave the boring stain on my soul. Avoid! Avoid! Avoid!"
1,"Dull, Heavyhanded, and Dull","I really wanted to like this book. Space travel, near-Earth exploration, Buzz Aldrin--what's not to like? Unfortunately, the story itself is dull and heavyhanded, an extended essay on the need for a continued US presence in space. The characters are one-dimensional, the major characters speak as though they're reading voiceover for a not-very-well-made documentary, and the plot itself is borderline plausible. I'm rather glad I bought this for $1 used."
1,Have To Agree With The LJ Review,"The review in Library Journal was right on the money. Althoughthis book covers the attack from a ""different perspective"", itmakes the Americans look both stupid and boorish. There is, in fact, a definite implication that they were drunk and ill-prepared while implying (perhaps unintentionally) that the Japanese were heroic in their actions. It is true that Ms. Tanaka is writing from the point of view of her characters, but since this is history and not fiction, it may become confusing for students, especially since, when mentioning (almost in passing) that the dropping of the atomic bomb killed 200,000 people, but fails to make a connection WHY this was done.Fine if you want a feel for the period but not if you want more than a feel."
3,Helpful Reference,"I use this book as a reference for learning about cell salts and for ideas on choosing a remedy for a particular pathology.I appreciate reading original works of the early biochemists- and this book is full of the flavor of those beginnings. Carey left us with his strong opinions regarding the direction medicine was taking in the early 1900's. In this book and other early biochemic texts I have found the origin of many ideas that seemed to be cutting edge ""New Age"" ideas that were popularized in the 1990's.Personally, I feel that these biochemists were ahead of their times. Their ideas about using cell salts are grounded in science. I have appreciated finding ways to ground ideas that seem foreign to western medicine in original texts such as this one.If you are a student of biochemic tissue/cell salts, I strongly recommend it as a useful reference. If you are looking for an easily accessible general reference, I would not recommend it."
4,Best Warm up jam with CD around,"Great simple ""tune your guitars boys we're going make some music"" -Nothing like DCG to get the juices flowin'"
5,"A MUST BUY -- Reads like a novel, but packed with great info","There are those who teach ABOUT technology, and then write a text and there are those who DO technology and write about their experiences and insights. Scherer is a doer. This MUST READ book is packed with information and practical strategies, but it adds real-life personal stories to weave together and make sense of the many scattered pieces we know as ""special education"" today. This book is a real treat. It reads like a novel but leaves you with much wisdom as well as useful ideas and insights."
4,My doggie's nose is black again.. but not sure if it's because of this product,"About three months' ago, my doggie's nose started to look pale (it used to be black). My wife suggested this product, in addition to dog milk (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VB23I0/ref=oh_details_o09_s00_i00) and fish oil (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009PQNDY/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00). I've started using them since then, and now my doggie's nose is black as it was before. So something might have worked, but I really have no clue to tell what is working."

3,A older text on MIDI string orchestration,"I was a novice when it came to the topic of orchestration, and I was looking to find an appropriate entry into the subject of orchestration and using samples. This is an older book/cassette tape combo and his samples were probably cool at the time (Proteus?). That aside, his purpose is to get you to hear the differences in various string instruments when they're played in different registers, i.e., cellos sound more ""emotional"" when they're in their higher register (isn't that true for everything??). If you're looking for information on how to specifically voice chords or how to voice lead them, you're not going to learn that here.I have since learned everything imaginable about voice leading by studying the Equal Interval System and I got the basic orchestral overview I needed to get me going by attending Scott Smalley's 2-day Hollywood Orchestration seminar. I'm sure others have found different paths that worked for them."
3,Very Dated,"It's fairly handy in the main cities, but the main focus is in the UK. There's a handful of other countries, but very limited. I liked that the author translated common terms/foods in the different languages, even if there were not specific resturants there. However, that was only for a few countries, it would have been helpful for the major languages in Europe. It would be nice if the author published an updated version and expand. But if you are just visiting one of the major sites of Europe, it'll be a general guide though."
4,Type Now - a very stimulating read.,"Published with the occasion of second Gerrit Noordzij Prize awarded to Smeijers, this book addresses sensitive topics for type design, such as copyright, originality and talent. As its subtitle shows, it is meant as a manifesto, followed by a showcase section, which features Smeijers' type designs to date and his commercial work for manufacturers like Philips and Canon.Smeijers is a brilliant type designer and outspoken educator and this book confirms that. A very stimulating read!"
4,Great series,This series is quite engrossing and keeps u reading for just one more page. There is clearly an ending to the storyline in this book and I look forward to new adventures.
5,Great Page Turner!,"I initially bought the book because he is a local author (always wanting to give new authors - especially local ones - support), but what I got was a great page turner! He makes the characters likeable, characters that are dimensional and not just people in a book.If you are in search of a good vampire book, I'd recommend this one!I read it in just a couple of nights and will read it again when the second one comes out."
3,A Very good (Unknown) Album,"***1/2While I was working in a little music store in the late 90's I came across many albums that were unknown to most people. One of those was a CD that looked old and weird. I liked the name Swell for its connection to the ocean and gave it a listen.I immediately liked it, and only grow to like it more with time. The music is very melodic, relaxed, and just flows together; it gets you almost right away. By now it is one of those albums that are very important to me and I (personally) don't know anyone else who knows this album (which makes it even more special)."
1,Prechters view is markets peaked in wave 5 in year 2000.,"Prechters view is markets peaked in wave 5 in year 2000.Never called the bottom in 2002, and stated thehigh of year 2000 would not be surpassed.Well 7 years later the DOW has indeed surpassed the year 2000 high!High of 2000 was ~12000, today it is nearly ~14000 !"
4,Sturdy and useful,"This platform is highly useful for working on ceiling projects such as drywall, moulding, electrical, etc. It is actually higher than I imagined so doubles at time as a very useful lightweight and portable table for other projects. Even when not working on the ceiling I set it up at a project site to use to temporarily store tools at the ready. It is wide and long-enough to allow fairly broad range of motion while you're working. The legs fold out and have a locking mechanism to prevent slipping. Overall a good quality product. I exceed the 225 pound limit and it hasn't broken yet so I trust it can hold more than advertised."
4,Moving,Just another by Belva Plain which I could not put down. Each book I have read authored by her makes me buy another. She does not disappoint.
5,A wonderful story depicting generational love and demands,"This story is one of the greatest I have ever read. Starting when I was 10, and now 9 years later, it has been a favorite of mine. The family and all the problems and passions that they go through show the reader how strong families are and how lucky people are to have one. I loved this book and I know everyone eho gives it a chance will, too!!"
2,Calling it a page turner is a lie!,"I had difficulty seeing why this is a page turner. There is no momentum between the chain of events as each happening did not seem inevitable. Instead, it seemed as if the characters were bored so the author had to invent something to keep them busy. Also, the awareness of time is weak. One week could be forever and another 5 years so be just a paragraph. The reader has difficult picturing Hennie (and the other characters) grow and mature and to be aware of any distinct changes. In characters such as Dan, we see the author trying to present two sides of a personality. Unfortunately, it is so badly done that we see it as out of character. Furthermore, the author's attempts at sentimentality and to present inner strength are corny and lame, I had trouble not laughing. Don't waste your money on this book, buy Danielle Steel instead."
1,oh my god,"People must be fool to buy this when you can get the same thing at the asian market, chinese food stores or indian stores for only one dollar, are they seller the jar or the tamarin. be careful."
3,Cloudy water,"My Koi are picky eaters, and this was no real exception to the rule. They didn't dive for it. It also made the tank water very, very cloudy. It got so bad I had to change food after only 1 week. I don't think it would have been too bad in a well circulated pond, but it didn't do so well in my 55g aquarium."
5,my koi love this food,"Its great food for color and smells like its yummy, tho I havent tasted it (yet) my koi were all very happy to be eating this food. not cheap, no, now what I do is mix this in with the food I buy in bulk that isnt as rich in carotenes."
3,A biography of Louisa May Alcott,"This book by is a biography of Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888), author of ""Little Women."" Upon reading this book, one can see how much of the author's life is given in her most famous work. This biography won the 1934 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. The young reviewer below from Pickering, Canada, complained about how the book drags on. Well, it is a little slow. What is more intriguing is the report that this book was required reading for our young reviewer in her 11th grade English class!!! The teacher of that class should be horsewhipped. This book is for young students, at most ages 12 or 13 (thus, grades 6 or 7). In a local school in this area, students were required to read in their 8th grade English class, among other things, ""The Odyssey"", ""1984"", ""Animal Farm"", and ""Lord of the Flies""! 6th graders had to read ""The Good Earth"", ""The Hobbit"", ""A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", and Steinbeck's ""The Pearl""."
3,slow,"I've started reading this book and the beguinning really does drag on, i agree. It gets better, but very slowly...."
2,Dragged on and boring,"This book....i have to be honest. was a drag to read. I like to read. Not often though, i like books that DON'T drag on. I can't stand Stephen King books (no offense to anys fans out there) because they are dragged on too much. Just like this book, i thought it was dragged on, long and boring. I didn't enjoy reading it. When i finally finished the book i was relieved that i have finished it.. It's just me too, I don't like reading books like that. I love ONLY science fiction and horror. Those type of books always seem to get my attention. Sorry if I offended anyone if they did like this book but it was really not my type of book , and the only reason why i did read it was because i had to for my grade 11 english class"
4,I independent studied using this book,"I never took the AP microeconomics course offered at my school. I just used this book and the PR book. Overall, this book is great in that it teaches all the information needed to ace the test. However, the questions in the practice test are not reflective of those on the real test. Also, sometimes, this book delves too deeply into the subject. It provides far more information than is necessary to get a 5 on the test. It is also more boring than the Princeton Review book. Information is presented in paragraph forms rather than in bulleted form, making it more unorganized. However, knowing this book back to front will easily get the job of getting a 5 on the AP test accomplished."
4,The reviews are good but the sample tests...,"I've scored a 5 on the ap microeconomics this year.And I had the chance to glimpse through this book just before the test. Well, about this book.The reviews are superb!!!It's full of economics that you will need on the test day.Also I liked the review questions in the end of every chapter.But there was one thing I was not satisfied with...The sample test... They are terrible.They're nothing like the test you'll see on the AP.Apart from that I found this book great.and to anyone who's studying for the AP economics, I recommend this book."
2,Horrible,"Upon studying for the AP Macroeconomics test, I found the Barrons book to be useless. The sample tests were a joke because they are nothing like the actual AP tests. I took an AP Macroeconomics course in school and the Barrons book did nothing to enhance my knowledge. I would highly recommend the Kaplan AP Economics book because it has challenging sample questions with full explanations to the answers (unlike Barrons). This book does not help one to get a 5 on the AP Macroeconomics test."
2,ok but a lot of mistakes,"The explanations were okay but there were a lot of mistakes. If you don't want to be confused, then don't buy this book."
2,Too Little For Too Many,"While an interesting beginning for a novice collector the author spans too great a time period to adequately cover any series of Winchester firearms. Winchester collectors are quite attracted to styles or types of firearms. This book barely answers even the most rudimentary of questions and as such is an overall disappointment. Secondly, the book would be greatly enhanced by more detailed and clear photography. This would assist the new collector in appreciating the marvel of these firearms - while providing a much better overview for future study."
1,A Major Disappointment,"Rarely have I been this disappointed in a book. It claims to be the history of Winchester which is certainly is not. What it is is page after page of very low quality black and white photos of Winchester firearms accompanied by a simplistic, broad brush description of each. Most of the text seems to have been lifted directly from one or more similar books which do a much better job than this piece of junk."
2,boring,you can play this game for a week and like it but you get bored with it theres only 3 tracks and they dont have the color palamino or the mane color palamino but theres 1 thing cool about it you can unlock the colors zebra and giraffe. and the black looks like brown and the black mane looks like brown. so save your money dont buy it
1,The Best Teachers' Test Preparation for the PLT Test Grades,This book did not adequately prepare me for the PLT K-6 test. The sample tests in this book were nothing like the actual test. Even the questions were totally different from those on the actual test. Don't waste your money.
5,Honest and true,un my opinion this book is one of the few books that give an honest opinion about the Arab world and its rich culture. And as an Arab i'm very happy and pleased to know that there are people who give other cultures a chance to be explained and understood.
4,"great content, not so great style","The book starts out with theoretical constucts and eventually uses examples to show their relevance. I found the authors' style of writing rather awkward. The organization of the material also makes the book somewhat difficult to follow. However, the well researched material presented is worth buying the book."
4,1966 Mustang Guy.,Not a bad key chain for use with my 1966 convertible. The valve stem covers add another simple touch which improves the look of my wheels. Rated this a 4 since the valve covers feel like plastic.
4,Same content,"This set contains both videos, Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass, at half the price! They come in individual cardboard sleeves inside a larger slipcase, not the clamshell cases, so these boxes take up less room, and they are very nicely packaged."
5,Alice in Wonderland (1985),"I saw this movie on the Disney Channel some 5,or 6 years ago, sometime in the mid to late 1990's,and haven't seen it since. Even though that was the first,and only time I ever saw this movie,I really liked it,especially seeing the all-star cast,as I remember seeing some of them in other movies I liked that I've seen them in,and some I've heard about,but never really watched many movies with them in it,anyway.I liked the singing, and dancing,and thought the little girl who played Alice, Natalie Gregory,was a great choice for the title role,I really liked her in the role because I felt she was pretty,and a real cutie in that red dress she wore in the movie,and beautiful platinum blonde hair,and played the role of Alice perfectly.I wasn't a real fan of the 1950's Disney cartoon version,or any other version since,but am a big fan of this live-action,1985 version,as I feel this version was the best one of all the versions both before,and after."
2,not that good.,"and i particularly remember loving this version as a child. it has some precious moments...but i wasn't a big fan of the songs and the various dances choreographed, etc. the movie might follow the book scene by scene more closely than any other movie, but it is hardly a sophisticated and thought-provoking adaptation. in fact, this film falls short of exploring and uncovering any of the profound and complex layers of the ""alice"" books.when filmmakers create a film out of a book, they should take the liberty of making use of visual and audio media, especially when the book is as trippy as ""alice"" and has the potential to be visually stimulating.all in all, i loved the disney movie so much more, which does not follow the book at all, but is just more memorable (in my opinion anyway). disney definitely makes full use of the advantages that animation allows - like defying the laws of physics! i'll just alwasy remember the cheshire cat standing on his head!"
4,Great Story! Predictable but great addition to the series.,"Option:Delta has every thing that Marcinko's fans have come to expect from his novels. Fast paced, gritty action, accurate details of specwar techniques, well researched locations, and a general feeling of fun and comraderie between Marcinko and his team of shooters. Although the plot of Dick meets Billonaire, Dick threatens Billionare, Dick kills Billionare is getting old, the book is still an enjoyable read from cover to cover. Keep up the good work, Dick. HOO-YAH!!"
5,A definite must have!!!!! Jam packed with action!!!!,"One of his most exciting books ever. I would close my eyes and be transported to the middle of the scene that Marcinko set. Any more real I and I might have been injured myself. I hope the ""Old Rogue Warrior"" Keeps putting books out. He should put his books on the big screen. A definite sellout!!!!! I cannnot go on enough."
3,Typical Marcinco,"For me, the excitement peaked during the lockout at the beginning of the book. I know that is always shaky. As for the rest of the book it is typical Marcinco. This time we are in Europe. There is a fair degree of excitement and carnage. I find, though, that starting with his 3rd book, the stories get a little more far out and less like true spec-ops. It is still a fun read but the reality level gets stretched with each new book. I still enjoyed the book though.I would like to see more of the Red Cell days where he could detail more of the security breaches made on US bases and the embarrasment he caused for so many CO's. A novel about ops in Saudi or Iraq or Isreal would be an interesting change of pace."
4,beats Net Force,"Tom Clancy wouldn't know a good action novel if it cracked his skull open! A refreshingly gritty, testosterone-charged alternative to all the bland military novels out there."
3,"A fun read, but a predicitable plot scenario","Dick Marcinko never stops the action, and knows how to write a real page-turner. This book is no exception, and my husband and I argued over who got to read it first (we ended up trading off each day). However, I found the plot line to be ""SSDB"", i.e. Same Stuff, Different Book. Billionaire badguy plots international realignment of power and damage to the U.S. Rogue Warrior steps in and saves the world from the bad guys. Dick, your books are fun to read, and I have no plans to stop buying them, but next time, could you try for a little more originality in the story line?"
4,Rogue Warrior: Option Delta,"Okay, so am I the only female on the planet to read Dickie's stuff? By the looks of the reviews, I am. Well you're a heck of a writer Dick (you too John!). I love your books. I've read them all and find the narrative exciting beyond compare. Just one thing, bring Stevie Wonder back in the next one, okay?"
5,Another Outstanding Rogue Warrior Adventure!,"Just when you thought Richard Marcinko couldn't do better than SEAL FORCE ALPHA, he blows you out of the water again! OPTION DELTA takes you along as the Rogue Warrior and his merry maruaders team up with a clandestine German SpecOps unit as they track down missing US tactical nuclear weapons to a ruthless man-Lothar Beck, who pursues his own sinister agenda. The action gets a little slow in spots, but Marcinko doesn't leave you hanging for long. Overall, a great story; can't wait for the next one!"
3,Enjoyable if unoriginal,"More three and a half stars, overall it's great to hear another grand tale from Dickie, replete with his dark humor, insights, and liberal use of certain colorful metaphors. A quick read that really gets in your face and immerses you, it is recommened for military and thriller fans.On the downside, it is very formulaic. Dickie goes on a mission, finds out something, investigates to find a rich guy creating a conspiracy. Confrontation and breaking and entering, followed by climatic battle with a stooge to show how tough Dickie is.I'm not looking for literature but more twists would be fun. Give Dickie an arc where he changes a bit. How about some competent female shooters and looters as allies or enemies. Maybe take on someone outside the mold and really shake the formula up. Getting into his personal life might be fun too.As always, a fun read that makes you think and laugh even if it fails to surprise"
4,Great Story,"This is a great story for all those people that enjoy spec ops ""fiction"". Good story telling!"
2,Roguishly Repertitive,How many times can you read about leading from the front to snoop and poop as Roy Bohem the grandaddy of all SEALs has taught us tadpoles.Get some new material!
1,Doom on Dickie,"Too bad I can't give minus stars... minus 5 would be giving too much credit. Seven bucks down the toilet in my opinion. WTF, being macho is fine but little Dickie must wear a size 38 hat to match his IQ.Full commander in the Navy, huh? Now there is an example of the military state of incompetence that Dickie tries to present. The book itself is pure formula fiction with Dickie as the rogue hero and the rest of his two-dimensional characters inserted merely to prop up his over inflated ego. As a veteran of SpecOps myself, I think Dickie is FOS (look it up in the glossery). His tactics are a sham, his mission is covert yet he brags to everyone he meets that he is a SEAL. If this work of fiction is based upon his personal experiences, as he claims, then it's a miracle that he and his team are still among the living. Option Delta is now lining the bottom of my trash can. Shame on Pocket Books and Simon & Schuster for publishing such garbage."
1,worst show,"I really, really, really wanted to like this british comedy and was hoping for the best, but it just fell flat - the characters seemed all entirely overplayed and the comedy just wasn't there."
5,Great for those learning Java3D,I had been looking for a book to help familiarize myself with Java3D and this was what I needed. The first half discusses some game theory and gaming in 2D graphics with Java. But the last half is devoted to Java3D. Anyone interested in game development or just creating 3D environments using Java should get this book.
2,Not the best,"I have to say I was excited when I picked up this book, but as I read the first few chapters I became extremely dissatisfied with the way it is written and the way the coding is handled. Coming from other books that teach java to this one was like going from the Bahamas to Alaska. painful to read and understand, lots of deprecated information and not much support online. Even the code provided on their website is not runnable without some tweaking."
3,Definitely not a book for the beginner,"If you want to learn how to develop Java programs with intensive graphics this will go over your head. If you are new, try another book. This is for people who already have a great handle on Java."
2,I miss Derek St Holmes ! buy Double live Gonzo instead,"buy Double live Gonzo instead, which is nugent's best ever live record. Ted plays incredible on this one, but sings quite lousy, let's be honest. If you want Nugent in his prime, get Double live Gonzo, with a real pro lead singer -the unsung hero Derek St Holmes- which also plays great rythm and lead guitar when Ted's ego lets him..."
2,Mostly Noise,"I saw Ted Nugent on a TV talk show last night and previously heard him interviewed on the Gordon Liddy radio show. I liked what he had to say and how he said it. I bought this CD to check out his music and was disappointed. I only liked two Songs Fred Bear and the classic Cat Scratch Fever. I am disturbed by his foul language and constant use of the F word. It doesn't seem like the same guy that wrote ""God, Guns and Rock & Roll"" He is basically a redneck and proud of it but talks more like a gangsta rapper, too bad."
5,"""America's #1 Son"" returns to fine form!","The ""Motor City Madman"". The ""Nuge"". ""Gun Toting Misogynist Nut"". Ted Nugent has worn many hats in his day, including a unigue chinchilla fedora with matching ascot - but I digress. This latest release from Mr. Nugent showcases his impressive, but largely unknown, saxophone ability. Although Nugent is best known for his ballistic guitar playing, bow hunting and taxidermy skills he is gaining a reputation with jazz insiders for his impressive chops. Many will be surprised to hear this collection of tender love ballads. Fans of Kenny G., Dave Koz and Boney James will surely be amazed by Nugent's fluid playing and true mastery of the sax. Recommended selections include ""Loin Cloth"", ""Bear Naked"" and the album's title track - a duet with Diana Krall. I can't begin to do this stunning album justice. Whether you're enjoying a romantic evening for two or gutting a freshly killed boar - this album is sure to enhance the mood."
3,SPM is back...,"SPM is back with a new album which supposedly consists of freestyle sessions. There are a few songs that are definitely freestyles but for the most part it seems orchestrated. SPM's last album ('Never Change', which was released in late 2001) did not live up to his previous efforts. This time SPM steps up his game a bit. While this album is levels above his last album, it still isn't as good as it could be. There are three songs that really stand out - tracks 7, 15, 16, and 17. The rest seems like filler. The production is bland, relying on repetative keyboard sequences. Shadow Ramirez, Filero are the album's best producers. Enlisting the help of Happy Perez would probably have helped a bit. If you're a diehard fan, you will probably like this album. If not, you're better buying previous albums, excluding 'Time is Money' and 'Never Change'."
4,SPM hollar at him,"I been a fan of SPM music since '96. I ain't trying to hate on this one, but this is his weakest cd. His production and Filero's production has'nt changed since the Hustle Town cd. This is mostly freestyles from Spm and Dopehouse family and not one song really stands out. Track 15 is probably the best and 17 is good but it sounds like you're listening to a tape. Some rhymes stand out and Spm shows he can freestyle, but the beats sound weak. Spm says this album was done in two days. They should've put more work on the music before releasing this cd.this is one bomb ass CD"
4,"More like Nowland, but still good","It's a nice compilation of stories that takes now and brings it into a look-ahead perspective. It's got a lot of variety, so you won't get bored that easily. Ranging from sibling rivalries to dating hassles, all the short stories have some common trait we all can relate to like fear, loyality, faith, love, envy, anger, hatred and so on. The best story in my opinion (which actually boosts this rating) is the one written by the compiler himself. Cart's pre-millenium tale about a boy in love with a priest's daughter is pretty good and the climax of the boy's choice over right and wrong, between love and faith is released very well. All in all, the book's not a bad read...worth a look but not a buy."
1,terrible book,What has said about this terrible book has already been said below. I borrowed this book from a friend and couldn't get head or tail out of this book. I can't understand why the first few reviews are so glowing and am writing to push down the star ratings.
2,No Sample Solutions to Self Review Exercises.,"I found this to be a potentially good book for learning Visual Basic for someone who has had experience with other languages.However, the absence of sample solutions to the ""Self-Review Exercises"" at the end of each chapter turns an otherwise good book into an exercise in frustration. Many of the ""Self Review"" exercises go beyond what has been covered in the chapters. It would be extremely helpful in the event one is unable to code the solution to an exercise, to be able to review sample code, learn from it and move on. The accompanying CD's and Website downloads offer no assistance. They are simply a mirror copies of the chapter project solutions already printed in the book and do not provide solutions to the ""Self-Review"" exercises. The absence of the ""Self-Review"" solutions, in my opinion, reduced this book from a 4 star rating to 2."
1,Not for Beginners,"This book does not deliver what it promises. I bought it BECAUSE it claimed to contain exercises and solutions. $100 dollars later (yes, that is what I paid, for the book and CD) I discovered, buried in the Preface, that in order to get the solutions to the actual exercises, you must be a teacher and have a PH representative.The authors also smugly tell the reader NOT TO send them mail requesting the answers. I thought this sneaky and unfair and I will avoid these authors in the future."
1,Not a good read without some outside help.,"I thought this book would launch me from my former enjoyment of Microsoft Basic programming endeavors into the fascinating world of object- oriented programming. I found it unfriendly and was sorry that its inability to lead one into new territory really required a knowledgeable guide or teacher. The CD which came with my copy would not boot on my PC, so that resource was unavailable and no help was forthcoming from the publisher despite many calls. This purchase was a... mistake."
1,A waste of $50! Avoid!,"What a cheaply written book! Filled with an overwhelming amount of detail, unfortunately the majority of it is no different to what can be found in the VB help screens. The authors add very little by way of their own input and where they do, it is needlessly wordy,frequently repeated and generally adds little. The programming examples are limited, poorly explained and little use to anyone seeking to learn complex VB for business use. Programming exercises seem poorly thought out and rarely draw out well the features discussed in the preceeding chapter. It's cheap two colour printing and irritating bug logos throughout only serve to add insult to injury..."
1,Visual Basic 6 - How to Program,"This is the most confusing textbook I have ever encoutered. Unfortunately, most community colleges have been mislead into believe that a novice could actually learn from this book. Maybe it is time for our colleges to forget the kick-backs and provide students with quality textbooks."
1,If you are a real beginner DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am not a programmer, but I wanted to learn how to program in Visual Basic. I took a class and we supposed to use this book. But, we didn't. Because it is not a book for beginner. May be it is OK for programmers who want to learn a new language, but if you are new to programming - stay away!!! Even teacher said it is an advance VB, and he was giving us a material from his book. If you want to buy a good intro to VB book - get a ""An Introducton to programming using Visual Basic 5.0"" third edition. ... excelent!"
2,"A poor textbook, and abominable reference.","I have been taking a VB course at a community college with VB-How To Program as the textbook. It has proved very unhelpful in terms of demonstrating how to put together even the simplest VB programs using built in functions and components. The authors do a decent job describing the algorithms used to solve the various problems, but never present information on the key built-in functions and GUI components that are what makes VB a RAD development tool. I am constantly frustrated when attempting to look up a function or component that I need to know how to use to implement a program example. The index is very poor, and the order in which topics are presented in the book is completely unrelated to the order in which you actually need to know them to program in VB. I cannot recommend this book and hope my Community College switches to another one in the interests of future students."
2,Not for Novice,"I'm not new to programming and this book was my first Visual Basic book as the contents looked impressive. The book was confusing and never got me started with Visual Basic. I had to buy Teachyourself and Complete Reference series to get started. As on today the book lies in my shelf for about an year, i don't feel like reading it anymore."
5,One of the finest VB beginner books,"This book is one of the finest and the most comprehensive VB beginner books that I have read. The book covers all aspects of Visual Basic 6 in a clear and concise manner. I wasted no time adding it to my list of favorite beginner books on my ""Visual Basic Book Reviews"" web site."
5,"Despite what everyone else says, Excellent book!","I can't understand why there are so many bad reviews of this book. I have read a few books about Visual Basic, and this is one of the best for beginners. It is clear and consise, and there are a lot of excellent programming examples. The Deitel books in general are great. Like I said, I don't understand why so many people hated this book. Maybe they just don't get programming..."
1,Inadequate for a student,"This book has been used as the standard text at a well known university for a number of semesters. However, due to numerous complaints, they will be taking it off the text list as of semester 1, 2002 and about time.The layout of the book is hopeless with its' mixture of BOLD text and red diagrams, let alone the assumptions the majority of the chapters make about the readers' experience. The answers to the chapter questions should be provided on the CD, not just to teachers/lecturers. I have read the book a number of times on various topics without success and gave up - looked elsewhere for the answers. Definitely not a beginners book - ""VB6 for Dummies"" is a far better option and approximately $AUS70 cheaper.The authors really need to look at their text layout style and providing answers to end of chapter exercises - I'll avoid further books from Deitel."
1,Not for beginners!,"I am new to VB, but not new to learning, and I found this to be one of the most frustrating books I've ever tried to learn from. It is being used by the college I'm attending in an accelerated program, much to my dismay. I spent a lot of money, blood, sweat and tears for a class in which I learned very little. I lay most of the blame on this book."
1,Not worth the money,"The book is just plain horrible! It assumes WAY TOO MUCH! I am learning VB6 in school and this is the book that they are teaching us from. Many times throughout the book they give program examples using things that haven't even been covered yet. The exercises at the end of the chapters are very vague. The choice of color also is bad (brownish/red text) and makes for a poor reading experience. The tips and common programming errors sprinkled throughtout the chapters become annoying very quickly. My advice, pass on this one."
5,A Great Help,This great book lets you know all the skills that kids in grades 1 to 6 need and has definitions of a huge number of math vocabulary as well as tons of other useful stuff.
2,NOT AS PICTURED,"I was very mislead with this product. None of the animal critters are included, nor are the bride and groom's attire. The flower girl dress looks like it will fall apart very easily. I will be sending this back."
2,Soft but poorly sewn,"I purchased these for my mom as she loves this scandinavian style. The lining is very soft though they feel a bit thinner than I expected. They are ""one size"" which generally means they won't fit me as I have long fingers, but these fit me quite well. Each mitten was sewn very differently. One was nice and rounded on the top and the other was sewn with much more of a point on the top. It was very obvious and I had to resew the pointy mitten to match the other before I felt comfortable giving it as a gift. Over all these are cute and soft, but I would not recommend them based on the lack quality for the price."
5,"Super cute on the outside, super soft on the inside","My husband gave these to me for a Christmas present. Since I've only worn them a few times I can't comment on long term wear, but on first glance these are great. They have an adorable pattern, and a very soft lining inside. I do think they're a little pricey, but they also appear to be good quality so it's worth a little more!"
5,So Warm!,"The lining is nice and soft so you don't have to worrry about scratchy wool.I love the design and saw it first on the hat. Since I was buying the hat, I needed to have the matching gloves!"
4,some of the best hardcore music out there,"this is great stuff. it sounds very similar to meshuggah at times, and like dillenger escape plan at others. track 1 and 6 are superb. check this out."
3,3 Stars for 3 awesome songs,"Sorry I can't jump on either of the bandwagons below. This isn't a 5-star effort, and it sure isn't a 1-star, either. I'll make this short:""Fearless,"" ""Hell Has Frozen Over,"" and ""Wings You Can Rely On"" are awesome. Nearly brilliant. The rest? It's okay, I guess <shrugs shoulders.> Is it worth buying? In my world, 3 good tracks is a goldmine. Let's keep Gerald in his smokes..."
3,It was okay...,"Pretty bobblehead overall. But the paint job was horrible and the stand broke off easily from his feet a few days after I got him. But, if your not too effected by that then this is a great bobble head. The figure looks just like Kenshin and I was happy he had his red shirt instead of the pink one on lol."
1,Nasty,All I will say is that there is enough nudity in this to fill a magazine. Very bad. Was not expecting it and disapointing. There was no warning either.I am angry about this. Please put warnings up when there is full or partial nudity in a film.
3,pretty nice globe,"I'm not a regular globe buyer but this one is satisfactory. The positives are many, including good detail, good base and overall good looks. The only negative is from the assumed hand glueing of the maps over the sphere. Some of the seams may overlap a bit or be short with a tiny bit of peeling. This all depends on how much scrutiny you look at it with. Anyway, I'm pretty happy with it for now but it may start to peel in the future."
4,good globe for general use,"I bought this globe for my 2year old son. He enjoys learning places (though he really don't understand what it is! I think). It is solid enough for a 2year old to handle. The globe is made out of some kind of cardboard. So it is not super strong, however it is strong enough as long as you don't play soccer with it. the stand is stable."
5,"Bought as gift, so only saw momentarily","I bought this as a Christmas gift for a seven year old ""studious"" kid, so I only opened and looked at it a bit. I had read the reviews about the strips being ""off"", so checked that, and everything was good. I'm glad I spent the extra ten to get the frame that goes all around the globe after reading reviews of less expensive ones that kept falling off the stand. This one seemed rather sturdy, and the parents are such that if it broke the next day, they would never tell me, so I can only guess that it seemed like a really good one, and if I wanted one for myself, I would have bought it again. I'm sure this kid will be careful with it, so it should last."
3,a few improvement needed,"My boys were pleased with this product however, I found that this globe was not as good as the one I used to see made 20+ years ago. It was not seamless especially the south pole area. I would say this is a functional globe but if you are looking for a fine product this is not."
2,i wouldn't buy these again,"these were pretty and that's why i chose them, but they're pretty heavy and don't hang well on the ear. they also were shipped missing a back."
5,review,"Possibly the best Buffet book ever written. If you only have two investment books, this should be one and the Intelligent Investor the second. Mr. Hagstrom covers several famous Buffet transaction's. The basis of Buffet's investment philosophies and several relatively easy examples of how to judge a company. A novice book but a fun read for experienced professionals."
3,Another good read about the 'Oracle from Omaha'.,BOTTOM LINE:More of the same information about Warren Buffett. We all know his story and his investment style. We know about his blockbuster deals in retrospect. Trying to dupicate his success; THAT's the tricky part!
1,This book is crap!,"The author of this book, Robert Hagstrom, has never spoken to Mr. Buffett about investing. Yet for some strange reason Hagstrom feels qualified to write about Buffett's investment methods. After the book came out Hagstrom started a mutual fund to exploit his readers' trust, Hagstom claimed that he was going to use Buffett's methods as outlined in this book. But Hagstrom's mutual fund turned in such poor results he had to close it down. If you use the investment methodology found in this book you too will get the same poor results that Hagstrom did. If you want to know how Buffett did it, you should look elsewhere."
1,A poorly written precise of Buffett's annual reports.,Far from giving the reader an insight into the investment strategies of the world's greatest investor this book simply summarises selected comments from Buffett in his annual reports of Berkshire Hathaway. Having read the book and the annual reports I can honestly say that Warren Buffett does it better! You can download the reports free of charge from the Berkshire Hathaway web site. Don't waste your time with this book.
2,Poorly written and not very useful,"This book was a chore to read, which is a shame because it could have been a great book due to its subject matter (Warren Buffet, one of the greatest investors ever). Unfortunately, the author's presentation is dry and dull, and the information detailed within is not as useful as it should be -- I had hoped to see more detailed discussions of the process by which Buffet makes his investments. My expectations for this book were high and they were dashed.Instead of reading this book, I would seek out and read Warren Buffet's own writings, as well as articles about him and his investments in magazines such as Business Week. Doing this will give you a rounded picture of ""The Warren Buffet Way"" with the additional benefit of Buffet's own commentary."
3,Warren Buffet's methodology on quicken,"It's funny to see that Warren Buffet methodology to select strong interest stocks on quicken website fails to give strong interest to IBM stock that Warren Buffet recently bought. It failed the stock by two out of 7 categories. Makes me wonder if I screened all stocks that Warren Buffet bought or held in his portfolio, how many of them would still pass the test of his own methodology used by Robert Hagstrom. So it's either Warren Buffet stopped using his own methodology to screen stocks or the methodology used on quicken flawed.IBM screeningPerformed well consistently? PassAvoids excess debt? FailConverting sales to profits? PassShareholder's money handled rationally? PassIncreased shareholder value? FailConsistently increased owner earnings? PassSells at 25% discount to intrinsic value? Pass"
3,"Interesting read, but light on ""strategy""","I enjoyed reading this book, but as one other reviewer noted, you can read all about Warren Buffet's ""way"" by reading his own writings--many are free online. I don't think that's a reason not to read this book, though, if you are primarily interested in just learning about Warren Buffet. If you truly want to learn how to invest, this book will probably leave you disappointed.While author Hagstrom goes into some specifics (i.e. how to determine the value of a company), most of his examples are vary vague in mathematical terms, leaving the reader feeling like investing is a bit mystic, still."
2,No depth to this book,"I can quickly summarize this book for you:<ul><li>Warren Buffett is a very intelligent man</li><li>Coca-cola Washington Post, Wells Fargo are all exemplar companies</li><li>Buy good value companies with good management</li></ul>This book does not go beyond repeating these points. It does not answer the mechanics of valuing companies or Warren Buffet's methodology of determining good companies. It merely looks at companies who have done ""well"" and provides historical data on what ""well"" means. The author does not even attempt to explain the companies' success by analyzing management's decisions or otherwise.This book is a good start for somebody who has never seen an investment book, but provides no real information to help with evaluating businesses. The information presented in this book can be summarized in 3 chapters -- Chapter 1 for Warren Buffets biography, chapter 2 for investment philosophies. Chapter 3 for historical data for Warren Buffet's favourite companies."
2,Too little content,"There really isn't much content in the book. I suspect the author had other interests, such as his management of a mutual fund that claims to be inspired by Buffet.First it goes into a little historical background on Buffet and his companies. Then one reasonably good chapter that summarizes his investment strategies. The final chapter repeats this all over again; a waste of print and paper.In the middle there are several chapters that describe his company's permenant holdings, long term holdings, and other holdings. These sections are extremly tedious and boring, and add very little value to the reader.Birkshire is very honest and strait shooting in its annual reports. Many readers would be better off reading to a copy of that, before picking up this book. And the annual report is free."
4,Great Book on Warren Buffet,"This is a great (and quick) read of how Warren Buffet invests. Beware if you are not interested in technical or financial speak, could be cumbersome. Great for anyone who has some basic finance knowledge."
2,Book doesn't work - I lost money,"I have tried to follow the aggressive growth investment strategies of Mr. Richards, but I have lost a great deal of money during this period. I appreciated the writing style and the content of the book which left both enthused and looking forward to boosting the value of my portfolio. Unfortunately, I think that Mr. Richard's premise that ""the trend is your friend"" is specious and misleading, because sometimes the trend is not your friend. I think perhaps I will attempt to adopt a less aggressive approach, and may try the 'value investing' approach of a Mr. Warren Buffet, whose company Berkshire Investments attempts to follow this approach, although they have lost a lot of money recently. Or maybe I will just try some treasury bonds, or maybe try nothing at all, or try gardening."
3,Meh,"For experienced investor or people who already know what value investing/Buffet's style is, this book will not help you much IMO. It is interesting to read about the various examples in the book but most of them are well pubclisized ie ""Buffet bought Coke because he was sure it would be a bigger better business in 10 years"".It didn't go nearly as in depth as I would have liked. I wish someone would write more about Buffet's early partnership days."
2,There's nothing new here,"There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website). If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment ""Buffett like"".If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett. Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here."
3,A good basic introduction to Warren Buffett Investing,"Buy this book if you are looking for a very basic book to start learning Warren Buffett's investing style. You will only get information on the companies he has purchased and their performance and a very basic explanation on why Mr. Buffett thought they were such great values when he bought them.There is no technical explanation here on how to figure book value or how to find your own value stocks. It reads like ""The history of Warren Buffett"" not ""How to invest like Warren Buffett"".I do like that the author included the classic Ben Graham analogy about ""Mr. Market"" that explains how to think of the stock market as a partner who offers to buy out your part of a business each day.For technical knowledge on value investing read""The five keys to value investing"" or the classic ""The intelligent investor"".For a complete explanation on stock market trading read the 5 star book ""The neatest little guide to stock market investing"" by Jason Kelly."
3,Too much of a good thing.,"The outline of Mr. Buffet's investment philosophy is profoundly worhtwhile reading. Unfortunately, the bulk of the book is concerned with providing examples of seemingly every investment he has made. The principles are discussed ad nauseum without adding any new insight.If this book was half as long as it is, I would have rated it a 9."
5,Love it!,Color is very vibrant and the design is beautiful! I can't wait to wear it on an upcoming cruise! Would highly recommend.
4,Tootsie Roll Pillow,"Pillow is nice and soft and looks like a giant Tootsie Roll. Very fun pillow, but I think the price could have been a little better."
4,No Time Like the Past -- A Morality Play in Time,"I rented this Twilight Zone episode as I like the time travel concept and wanted to check it out. Our hero [Dana Andrews] goes back to important times in history and tries to change them, but something always happens that prevents him from doing so. He tries to evacuate Hiroshima before the A-bomb -- no luck. He tries to put a bullet into Hitler when Hitler is making a speech -- no luck there, either. Finally he gives up and wants to settle down in a 19th century town and retire. But he is afraid of making changes that could affect the future. Huh?? But if he could not make changes in the first place no matter how hard he tried, how could he make changes accidentally? You know, time travel paradoxes aside, this story is about a man who wants to make positive changes -- it ends well for him. Rent this out.Dana Andrews has also appeared in mainstream stuff:Communist/FBIZero Hour!"
1,"Boring, and too LONG!","when you think the episode is going to get good, it doesn't, very disapointing and not worth your money, don't by it the one hour episodes are really boring, there's driftwood stuff thats in there but doesn't really effect the story at all, do me a favor and don't make the same mistake I did, which is me watching the episodes... AND DONT BUY IT!"
5,Review OF Twilight Zone,I got this order in perfect condition. It came so fast I couldn't believe it. I have always loved Twilight Zone and I will be watching this for years to come.
5,Great show but only 1 volume?,"The five stars is for the show, but while I was really excited to see this dvd as my daughter and her friends (7-10) love it but I was disappointed to realize this was only volume 1 with limited episodes. I can buy the entire season for half the price on iTunes."
4,Grand-daughter loved it.,My grand-daughter loves this shoe. She would watch the same episode over and over if she were able. It's part of Prime.
4,Good Show,"My daughter really loves this show. We watch it on the Kindle Fire on road trips, so it was worth the purchase."
2,Warning H2O Fans,"Was glad to see that Season 1 of the show got a Region 1 release, but what is incredibly disappointing is how it was released. This is not a traditionally mastered DVD. THE DISCS ARE DVD-R and the image quality reflects this type of mastering. Be very careful with these recordable discs if you want to enjoy watching this release as time goes on. This series deserves better. Lets hope Season Two gets a proper release."
1,format,My daughter was very disappointed that these DVD sets have not been re-formatted to allow viewing in the USA.Hopefully the company will produce a release in US Standard format soon.
1,Remember to deactivate click n buy,I did not realize how easy it is to buy the movies. I was out shopping and got an email congratulating me on my purchase. Apparently my 4 year old was on The computer & bought 2 movies before we knew it. Hind sight...
1,Splash for 'tween' girls,"An Austrailian import, it is a 'Splash' for tween girls. In comparision, it makes power rangers look like high drama. Don't waist your time or money here."
5,H2O is Good Clean fun!,"This is a really cute show, and I've enjoyed watching the episodes I've watched so far (I'm halfway through the season). The characters are quite likable. I'm sure I'll end up getting the other seasons as I finish this one up."
1,Only 1 Volume of a 3 season show,"I returned this the very same day that it arrived in my mailbox.I was very disppointed to find that this only contains part of the first season. According to the folks at Amazon's customer service, there is almost no chance that the balance of the first season will ever be released by Amazon; not to mention the other 2 seasons of this great show.Fortunately all of the episodes exist on both Netflix and Hulu so I can watch them there; but I would have loved to be able to throw a DVD in the machine whenever I wanted to see an episode of this great Australian TV program."
2,Interesting toy,"I recently played one of these instruments (from another vendor). It has a windcap rather than a pirouette, which would make it a rauschpfiefe, but unlike either, the bore is cylindrical (or very narrowly tapered), rather than broadly conical. The sound was weak and lacked any of the strident power of a shawm (which should be loud enough to raise the dead, or at least get them to roll over in their graves...). When compared with a real shawm (like a zurna), it is apparent that this instrument was designed by someone who really knew nothing about shawms.About the only positive things I can say about this are (1) it makes noise, and (2) it's a fairly attractive looking thing if you want it as a prop rather than as an instrument.I'd consider this instrument to be worth about $20, not the $100+ that it's being sold for."
1,"Horrible, Racist Trash","I'm not sure how anyone can speak of this book as well-written, and I'm even more horrified that the racist tirades contained in it are described as a complex secondary narrative. No way. This is poorly written self-congratulatory racism, homophobia, and (much more subtle) sexism. The author doesn't have the skill necessary to spin a complex secondary narrative, much less one that is critical of its narrator; this racism is heartfelt, and it should not be ignored or overlooked. It turns my stomach."
5,Best Coffee Ever,"I didn't realize it had a water filter on it and was happy to get it. Pouring the water in is not the easiest, but it was like that onmy old $9.99 Mr Coffee Maker. Coffee is great!"
3,not the best,"This coffee pot is just OK!!! Not great, not bad either. Things I don't like are it shuts off after only 2 hours of keeping warm. Also it is hard to fill with water, very tall, it fits underneath cabinet until you need to fill it with water, then it must be moved out from under the cabinets. Just really not the greatest coffee pot ever."
4,Remarkable Insight into the Psychology of Ancient Warfare,"This is a meticulously researched historical novel filled with gore, greed and generosity and bristling with the kind of insight that shows why men fight selflessly in battles that are foregone conclusions. It is the story of Alexander the Great and his ten year march east to conquer the known civilized world, told in his own (imagined) words and filled with battlefield details, military strategy and insights into the complex mind of a great warrior, both sympathetic and brutal.Pressfield is a former Marine, whose material is so well written and tactically accurate, I understand that it is read by students of warfare and endorsed by the Marine Corps Gazette and Leatherneck, Magazine of the Marines."
3,Why are you reading this book?,Before considering this book you really need to know why you are considering buying it. I bought it because I was both interested in Greek Civilization/History and the fact that I hoped to glean some insight into leadership. This book gave me both and was good. It moved a bit slow in the explanation of tactical movement of various units and seemed to bog down in this area. Overall I enjoyed the book (certainly enought to finish reading it). If you are not particularly interested in this time period I think most would probably find this book boring. This is an informative book but not one read for any entertainment value.My rating is a combination of what I would give the book (4 stars) and what I think the average persone would probably rate it (2 stars).
3,"Ehh, at least it was better than the movie...","Pressfield is terrific - Gates of Fire remains one of my favorite historical novels of all time. In his book on Alexander, I think Pressfield fails because he is trying to do too much - the scope of the book is too broad and it doesn't seem that Pressfield was as thorough with his research. Alexander is my favorite historical personage and this just didn't do him justice. The Persian Boy by Mary Renault is a much better place to start."
5,Pressfield does it again-stunning!,being in the military i love to read anything about Alexander the Great and ancient Greece.I had read Mr. Pressfield's previous books and i can honestly say this one is a worthy entry. I could feel like i was on the battlefields right next to Alexander and his companions. A MUST READ!
3,It is helpful to know your history before reading this....,"I like historical fiction and I have an interest in history (why else would I read historical fiction???). I am no historian, but I have read up on Alexander the Great and am familiar with his battles, life etc... That said, at times I was lost while reading this book. There is little in the way of background. The focus seems to be more on battle narrative (there were three hundred of this nationality, led by ....) and less on why the battle occurred in the first place and its overall importance. The pieces on his struggles with morale, logistics and diplomacy were enjoyable but felt limited. If you are going to read this, do yourself a favor and buff up on your history first, it will make the tale more understandable and enjoyable..."
5,The Virtues of Pressfield ...,"... are on lavish display in this tour de force of a novel. He wrestles with ideas so big and times so remote that one wonders how he had the audacity to pull it off. The answer, he might tell you, is that it wasn't him. It was his daimon (Greek for animating spirit or genius) If I could easily summarize how well executed this novel is you wouldn't have to read it. Suffice to say, he pulls it off. This book is a profound exploration of what drives people to greatness, the nature of war, what binds men together and what tears them apart. It tests the limits of ambition (both Alexander's and Pressfield's) and is, in every way satisfying - Intellectually, historically, viscerally and (most unexpected) emotionally. You will not regret."
2,Disappointing compared to other Pressfield,"There are interesting aspects of Alexander which a fictional book can take a stand on: his godhead, patrocide, homosexuality, fascination with the East, etc. Pressfield ignores these almost completely. E.g., he doesn't even mention the pilgrimage to Sliwa.So I agree with other reviews that you would do better with a biography such as Michael Grant's."
2,a little too intraverted and hard to understand the battles,"not sure i will actually get through this book as it is highly technical on the battle strategy and tactics and a little too much in the head of Alexander, which I am not sure how the author got there. There isn't much history written about Alexander's inner thoughts."
2,Made for TV Movie,"Disregard all the pretentious blather by the 5-star raters. They must be friends of the author or in league with the publisher.This latest pseudo-historical is nothing more than glorification of an idealized western conquerer who was more akin to Peter Pan ad Michael Jackson than Genghis Khan. That's right, Alexander was known to invite 'pretty little boys' to share his tent during the evenings--and it wasn't for milk and cookies.. How come most Historians and books about Alexander leave out the telling nugget of information.As for the rest of the book, there are some interesting moments when topics related to battle tactics, logistics and strategy are covered. Otherwise, the book seems to pander to the Hollywood crowd looking for the next Braveheart or Troy where central hero gives a motivational speech before the killing begins.If you must read this book, check it out from the library and save the trees."
2,Disappointing,"Nice and very personal in some descriptions, e.g. the battle scenes, but Pressfield leaves huge holes in his story of Alexander the Great. What happened, for example, with the conquest of the cities in Near Asia, where is Egypt, what about the long journey home from India?Compared to Pressfield's earlier books, Tides of War and Gates of Fire, surprisingly disappointing."
3,Read Alexander the Great's Art of Strategy instead,"Much better history, much more gripping battle descriptions, and much more authentic history. Why read a fictionalized account of Alexander the Great when the non-fiction version is even more exciting. Of the books I have recently read on Alexander, Alexander the Great's Art of Strategy is the best."
5,History as a Novel,"After all the celluloid versions of the story of Alexander the Great, its great to read a book that gives a more realistic version, and a more human version, of the iconic Alexander."
3,brilliant,"I bought this book becuase I wanted a colourful introduction to Alexander, and I have to say this was a great read. Getting used to the first person narrative is a little strange for the first few pages, but you quickly get used to it. In fact it adds much to the power of the book. The detail, the places, the colour, sights and smells; Pressfield paints an evocative picture. This is really thrilling stuff, well researched and worthwhile. I am glad I read this. Great introduction to an extraordinary man.3 stars becuase although I loved the book, and highly recommend it, I have become sceptical of all the five star reviews on amazon. Folks, this one wasn't written by a friend of the publisher. honest!"
5,Clearly a book for those who dream of paradise,"My copy of Vagabond House is weather-worn and the pages yellow with age. Still its words bring to mine the early 50s as a college student when I yearned for love and adventure. In fact, my first true love and I treasured the dreams inspired by the book. We dreamed of our own Vagabond House and the love and joy it would bring us."
1,Misleading,"Case is not as pictured,overpriced for the stupid case that it comes with , false advertising...Technitool is a waste of time, dont waste your money..way cheaper at sears."
5,WOW!,"I just finished this book. What can I say? WOW! It was like a ""war"" between Hero and Heroine. I guess I am some kind of pervert, but I really loved it :-) It was fun!"
4,Beneficial to teachers!,"Dr.Thomason's book Writer to Writer allows any teacher the freedom to take the writing process one step further in their classroom. We had the luxury of bringing Dr. Thomason to our district as a consultant and I was convinced that he alone, initiated our teacher's to be risk takers and allow their children the opportunity to express their thoughts freely and without failure. I recommend this book to any teacher struggling with implementing the writing process in their classroom."
3,To relieve headaches,This CD will relieve your headache by blowing off the top off your head. Inventive and misguided industrial death swing. I love it!
4,Great follow up album for an underrated band,"This album is full of really cool metal songs that are pretty addicting, i especially like the song Never again, I can't wait for Kilgores next album, hopefully there will be one."
2,Generic,Unimpressed. This music is aweful. It sounds like all the other bands in the genre and it doesn't contribute much. Jay Berndt is a sad excuse for a vocalist and the album is truly not worth it. It's interesting how much people like this garbage. Oh well.
1,Very direvitive of alot of better bands,Rip off of alot of bands you'd be better off buying anything by clutch.Now theirs a good band!
5,Great,Great high energy riffs! But this song Never Again is worth the 15 bucks alone. purely awesome
4,Second one was just what I wanted.,This system was purchased as a gift to replace my father's blown up year old RCA reciever. The first one I recieved did the same strange clicking sound that another reviewer had noted. Perhaps I got the one he sent back. The service on the return was first-rate and the functioning unit performs better than I thought it would. Good sound quality and volume. Swell entry level surround system. My family has had good luck with RCA products in the past. Hopefully the unit Pop has now serves for a long time.
1,Lasted only 2 weeks,"I bought a ""refurbished"" unit for my mother-in-law. All she wanted was the CD music and Sirius radio - no DVD or anything else. Felt for this ""basic functionality"" I was OK with a used unit. Well guess again! Unit totally quit working after only 2 weeks. Does power on then just sits there with a blank screen. You cannot even power it off. Only way to power off is to unplug it. Wow! I am just starting to work though the Customer Service nightmare. Oh, and by the way, ""Sirius Ready"" means you have to buy an additional $50 receiver for it to work with Sirius."
4,Touching story. Flockhart has huge range. Great soundtrack,"Calista Flockhart plays an extroverted druggie who changes the life of a reclusive writer. It's an emotional roller-coaster, highs and lows of a doomed relationship. Hip cutting, grungey locations, good chemistry. Bring six handkerchiefs. Oh yeah, and the track just rocks. Hope there's an album coming out."
5,Outstanding,"This is an excellent film full of brilliant dark humor. It's got a wonderful bleak carnival quality. Calista is excellent, and Chris Peditto is a great foil to her frantic energy. It's a weird, wonderful journey."
4,Very gritty sad urban drama,"Calista Flockheart as a druggie? Wow! Had to see that one and what a surprise it was. The story was well-paced and very realistic, almost documentary like. She is very believable as a drug abuser. Loved the soundtrack -- any album available in the future? Better than A Midsummer's Night Dream by a long shot."
5,"Jane doe, Ally Mc beal or _ she's fitting in any role.","Calista is going to be a great actress in the future as she is now.The movie JANE DOE is very imoionally expressed with her views. I think she had worked with her heart in the movie.It gives the message to coming younger generation about ill effects of druggism & ofcourse about love, that how much she loves her boyfriend while those in love will learn the lesson that how much they are loved by their lovers.I hope by watching this movie you could be the fan of calista( because of not, se's sexy but by her role) thank you very much. If i could have wish in my life & that is to meet her once while i'm alive.thats it! You'll see the movie & u'll find it more."
4,flashes of greatness!,"It's a shame this movie never made it to theaters. I was suprised at just how funny and moving it was. Calista Flockhart shows depth and range never seen from the ""Ally McBeal"" star. The writing has a ring of truth and a compelling flow. Christopher Peditto has a winning deadpan charm, and the rest of the cast are quickly but surely drawn - especially Elina Lowenshon as Jane's druggie friend. If you are a hardcore romantic, this poignant and touching love story is for you."
5,Great Film,"This is a great movie with a great cast. I was never a big Calista fan, but here she shows that she has the talent and depth of a big-league movie actress. I wish Calista would do more movies and less Alley McBeal."
3,A good movie,I mainly got this movie because it has a edge to it. I dint really know what to expect with this movie since I had never seen the previews for it I mainly just got it becasue the cover looked integing and it had Calista Flockhart in it and she is one of my favorites. I thought it would have this corky edge to it because Calista usually dose more corkey roles but this was of corse corkey but it also did have a major mix od drama which I think deffinitly also added something more to this movie. I say its a must rent.
5,i love calista flockhart,"i just love her in anything...any movie,any soap and would be very pleased if i could meet her...she is just the kind of female i wanted to see in the movies...sweet,cute,smart,broad-minded...i could just go on and on about her and i am totally in love with her...."
2,Poor writing too hard to overcome,"I was really interested in this subject and thought I chose this book carefully. I liked the table of contents and am sure that the author did a tremendous amount of reseach for this book. The style of writing, however, is so bad that I can't finish it. It is written in a droning, dry, over-generalized undergraduate academic style that puts you right to sleep. The author chose to write a formal report, full of unnecessarily long, awkward sentences and stiff language, and gave away the opportunity to tell the stories of these important river basins. This is not a complaint about wanting to be more entertained. There is a lot of information to convey and few readers will be familar with the details. Still, the pain of reading this book just isn't worth the time and effort it will take to finish."
1,It broke,"Although advertised as ok on stove top, the first time I used it this item broke on the burner at medium heat. I have corresponded with the manufacturer and have yet to receive any response. Maybe I misunderstood something but seems I'll never know. I'm very disappointed."
4,Decent redux of FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER,"As far as action goes, this was a good book. However, it is almost exactly like Stephen Coonts' FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER: a carrier pilot goes flying where he shouldn't during the Vietnam War after losing his second crewman, catches hell for it, and is barely saved by an act of Congress. The only differences are that with RULES OF ENGAGEMENT, he's a Marine fighter jock instead of a Navy attack driver, and it happens near the beginning of the war instead of the end."
4,"The Anchor of Fleetwood Mac, McVie Shines with Performance","The hidden gem of Fleetwood Mac went solo in 1984. Christine McVie is truly underated in her talent as a singer and songwriter. If you like the smooth vocal blends and the consistent performance that Fleetwood Mac offers, you'll love this work. Christine shows that she can write and sing blues, ballads, and mid-tempo rhythms that would make Mick Fleetwood turn his head. In fact, Mick is on a song or two. Not only is McVie in better voice than ever, her songs tend to rock a little harder her norm. McVie also creates many atmostpheres that stick to a very pleasant formula. While she doesn't go over the top like Lindsey Buckingham, this album is very solid and a definite gem for your collection. It's safe to say that Fleetwood Mac would have a huge hole without Christine. Great songs: One in a Million, Got A Hold On Me, Ask Anybody, This Smile I Live For, and The Challenge."
4,The most underrated woman in rock!,"Christine has one of the most beautiful, melodic voices I have ever heard. It's a shame more people don't realize this. Though none of FM's members are quite as good on their own, if Christine had been properly marketed and produced, I feel her solo career would have rivaled Stevie Nicks'. This album deserved to go platinum. It's surprising that more than two singles weren't released; The Challenge and One In A Million are just as good as any of her FM material, and could have charted. There is, however, a few duds. So Excited doesn't fit well with the rest of the songs, and Who's Dreaming This Dream is boring. But there is something for every FM/CM fan out there; you won't be sorry you bought this."
2,An unfortunate disappointment,"To be disappointed in anything Christine McVie does musically is a surprise, but this album was disappointing. Always the better voice in Fleetwood Mac, she doesn't disappoint in that area, but the songs themselves are fairly mundane. Most of the songs contained on this album seem over-produced which seems to make them bland and repetitive. I had no real desire to go back and listen to anything again after my initial and a repeat play of this album."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Although you can probably find this CD in the bargain bin, don't even waste your $$$ . I was really disappointed in this CD. I like Christine but have always felt the true draw and star of Fleetwood Mac was Stevie Nicks.It does't sound like there was any thought or effort put into the songs on this CD.It's a good thing Christine has decided to retire -"
5,"One of, if not the, best solo album from a Fleetwood Mac member","Always the possessor of a rich, deep singing voice no matter what she's singing, this solo work from Christine McVie pretty much goes to show why she was always considered the most important member of Fleetwood Mac. She had a huge pop hit here with the indelible ""Got A Hold On Me"" and a somewhat less sizable hit with ""Love Will Show Us How."" Also great are the Got A Hold On Me-ish ""The Challenge"" and the dark, haunting ""Ask Anybody."""
4,Legendary,"This is a very fine album from an under-rated singer, and a good addition to any British blues collection. However, this is not her best or only solo effort. Her first, VERY hard to find, solo record, ""The Legendary Christine Perfect,"" was recorded before Fleetwood Mac came to be. I'm guessing the late sixties. I believe Mick Fleetwood and John McVie both play on the record as well. That album will give you an idea of where the real bluesy stuff from FM's ""Kiln House"" and ""Penguin"" came from. Of course, all this was before Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks joined up, (regretfully) turning the band from blues to pop. You'll thank me if you find it. :)"
2,not her best,"I have loved Christine McVie and her songs since she joined Fleetwood Mac. Her songs on Mystery to Me, Bare Trees, etc. got me into the group before they hit the big time, and her later songs, often along with Lindsay Buckingham got even better. So I am sad to say I am disappointed by this disc. Just not as good as her best. Many rock songwriters run out of creative gas, and it sounds like she has. I hope she can reinvent herself rather than try to rehash the same chords and lyric themes."
2,What a letdown!,"I love Christine's input with Fleetwood Mac, but this CD is bor-ing! The chorus of ""Got A Hold On Me"" is repeated about 4 times too many, and the rest of the CD is only average- there is no song on this CD I would really want to hear. Christine sounds much better when heard between Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks songs on a Fleetwood Mac album."
2,radio review,"I got my radios before they were due to arrive. I like the radios instuction are easy to follow, but the range is not nearly as good as advertised. I'm lucky get 3/4 mile on all radios the small radios have a range just as good as the Motorola T4550AA GMRS. i'm disappointed about the range. I think the wattage is to low and they need a better antenna.overall I would rate them a 3 on a scale of 1 to 5"
5,a great help in getting firewood,easy to use and a great help when out in the woods getting firewood - don't know how I did it without them
4,Big Hit,My Grandson (7 years old) loves dragons and this was perfect. He played with it in the Puppet Theatre that I made out of cardboard box.
1,Piece of garbage...,Was not even sewn all the way on the wings. Tried to get issue resolved but not resolved to date.
3,"E neste canto, o lola falana de Brasil","Glitzy Vegas-styled review by Brazil's reigning Axe queen. Produced by MTV-Brasil (if only MTV-USA was as enlightened, eh?). Appearance by percussion juggernaut Olodum. Nice set, but for hardcore fans only."
4,for suzi lovers,"My first concert back in about 74 was suzi quatro and alice cooper in downtown detroit. suzi came on first and damn near stole the show. She rocked from start to finish and live, her sound was much harder than came across on record. As for this cd, I got it and it is almost perfect except for the missing song"" can the can"" which I have on another cd luckily. The second cd I have read negative reviews on. I don't know what the reviewer was listening to but I thought it was almost as good as the first cd. Good old fashioned rock and roll influenced by chuck berry, little richard, and jerry lee lewis. Get this cd, it is well worth the money"
1,Waste of Money.,"This is a very poor product from Ultra. The voice recording isnt sensitive enough and when recording FM or Voice, the Unit puts alot of feedback/noise into the recording.The SD slot is a really stupied design and locks up the player every now and then. FM sucks, everyting about this player is terrible. Feels real cheap.Oh and even though the battery is half way charged, I plug it into my computer through USB to charge it and it says on the player that its fully charged.Do not buy."
2,Beware - no resume feature,"I bought this looking for an MP3 player expandable via SD memory cards. The player has helpful features but does not remember where you were in a track when it shuts down -- a feature commonly called ""resume"" or ""bookmark"".If you're listening to a spoken-word podcast / audio file, this means you must write down your place in the file on a piece of paper before you shut the unit down, and then must fast-forward to that place when you power it back up.One helpful feature is that you can navigate the player via file folders...so you could put several genres of music / spoken word into several folders to find an item of interest easier.However the lack of the resume feature is a big shortcoming, and I wish I hadn't bought the unit."
3,"This is not a martingale harness, but it is exactly as advertised","I looked at many harnesses and knew I wanted a front-pull, martingale harness. When I was looking at the SENSE-ible, I didn't notice it wasn't a martingale. So, I was disappointed on that score when it arrived. But that's my mistake. It is well-made, and the profile is low--in other words, I can pet my dog without having to dodge a million bulky buckles. The colors are extremely limited in the small sizes.It didn't control pulling much better than back-pull harnesses.If you don't care about the martingale feature, then I can recommend this. However, I'd suggest that you reconsider. Without the martingale feature, the harness shifts around significantly. With a martingale, I can leave the harness loose, but the dog tugging snugs it up without pulling the harness around, which would, I fear, lead to chafing or discomfort."
4,Great for a while,"This harness makes it possible to walk my spaz-tastic maniac of a border collie. He zig-zags like crazy, and this at least keeps him turning the right direction, and he is very quickly pulled back on course if he goes the wrong way or too fast (or both). It is nice how effective it is without hurting him - it's not around his neck, so he never chokes, and it never seems to cause him discomfort; he doesn't mind wearing it. However after three years, one of the plastic spokes of the fastener broke off, and now I have to replace the whole thing. My suggestion is to look locally to see if you can get it cheaper. I got our first one from his rescue organization for $25. Unfortunately that's in a different state."
4,Does the job,"Works as stated, but the ivory color does not match the standard ivory color of switch plates."
3,Not so god,"It is very tight in the neck and the leather imitation is very sheep, comes without protective bag. Looks nice but...."
2,Great main event...and that's about it!,"Starrcade ended the pitiful WCW year of 1993. The main event ended up being Vader vs. Ric Flair, who substituted for Sid Vicious (and we all know THAT story!). This match was, in a word, awesome! VERY emotional. It was a classic to say the least. Now, as far as the rest of the PPV goes. DUD. Cactus Jack & Maxx Payne carry the Godwinns to a watchable match (but not good). Other than that? Can you say Shockmaster vs. Awesome Kong? I can't recommend this in good concious, but try to catch the Vader/Flair match if you can."
4,Get this tape if only for the main event,"If you wish to purchase this tape, don't expect this to be any good get this if only for the main event which is great."
5,A classic wrestling event!,"I must say, this is one of the best wrestling videos I have ever scene. It is a must for any Ric Flair fan. END"
4,STARCADE 1993,"if you wanna get Starcade 93, this is what it is. On the video box it advertised a Sting vs Rude - World Title Match, which apparently wasn't on the tape"
1,What? This is the worst Starrcade Ever!,"If you believe that this is a good PPV, your reading the wrong review. Every match except Flair v. Vader is terrible. Shockmaster vs. a Kong? Twenty Nine minutes for Sting & Hawk v. The Nasty Boys? Flair v. Vader is good, but not Flair's usual five star match. Get this only to hear the HUGE pop for Flair. Otherwise, avoid this PPV."
5,Extensive information you won't find elsewhere,This book does a good job of summarizing ALL of the action in ALL of Africa during WWII. I found the information about the conflicts between Vichy French and Free French forces in the French colonial possessions to be very interesting. There is also a lot of information about the combat forces the Free French contributed to the Allies.
5,Best Cowboy Music,"I was driving on a trip out West and bought this CD at Mount Rushmore. What a pleasant surprise. We played it over and over because the music is so well done with different instruments used on each song. Easy listening and brings one to a place of remembering the ""good old days"" of the West. Love, love, love it. Wish there was a volumn 2."
4,Nice Cowboy CD,"i really like the CD. it has nice instrumentals of many classic cowboy songs. the quality is very good too. the only downfall is that the CD is only about 30 minutes long so it is quite short. but other than that, i recommend it for anyone wanting to hear these nice classic songs."
4,Cute Handbag,What a cute handbag! So glad I found it on Amazon as it is a discontinued color. It's big enough to put in all your necessities but small enough to not be a burden to carry around when you're on the go. Love the Kipling style.
1,This extremely cheap mess is so laughably bad at times that it's [almost] entertaining,"Mickey and Sonya rob a bank with the assistance of two other girls. Two of them are killed, But the cops make a mistake and think that three of them died instead. Now, They're after only one suspect. Sonya sets Mickey up to take the fall for the crime and years after she gets out of prison, Mickey goes looking for revenge against her former friend. This is too bad to be true. The guns look very unreal, There's no gunfire to be seen when the guns are fired, And there's no sound effects to be heard when people are hit. Not to mention, The acting is very atrocious and the action scenes in this movie are piss poor. All copies of this movie need to be buried somewhere and never dug up. Definitely not worth viewing under any circumstances. Hope this review helped, And you can bet, That i'm out."
1,Taking care of Parents Who Didn't take care of you,"This is the most worthless piece of drivel I have ever read. The description is very misleading. It does nothing but serve up platitudes, with no concrete steps to resolving a problem. Every instance ends up the same-forgive them, look in the mirror and tell yourself you are doing your best, ad nauseam. It does give examples of many situations encountered in caring for our parents- it just fails to give constructive ways to handle them. If I could give a no star rating, I would have for this book."
2,Fix the mistakes,"While this book is a good attempt at placing statistical topics necessary to toxicology in one spot, the mistakes are inexcusable. Many formula are incorrect as well as text referring to the wrong tables or data. Therefore, one begins to lose trust in the information presented. Be careful if you use this book!"
3,"Not the best ""Catholic"" novel I have read.","This book was a bit of a surprise. While it is not the best ""Catholic"" novel I have read, its many good parts provide much to recommend it. I have been familiar with the story line from the Gregory Peck movie which has been a late-show staple. The book is more intricate and nuanced, like novels used to be. Cronin's characters are well-drawn, seem consistent and grow in your imagination like real people. He has a notion of ecumenism that concervative Catholics might find simple-minded and perhaps offensive, but probably reflects his childhood experience, with which many American Catholics could easily identify, that sometimes God lets himself be found extra ecclesiam.In sum, a good book. I am glad I read it. I had trouble putting it down at night."
4,excellent civil war movie,"Gods and Generals is a deeply moving film with outstanding acting. Moreover, the events displayed are historically correct and the romantic aspects of the film make it very enjoyable. I highly recommend it."
2,The book was better,"While I found the cinematography excellent in many ways, the dialogue was flat and uninspiring as was the acting in general. A very disappointing film IMO. I had really enjoyed reading the book but not this film."
2,Gods and Generals,The movie was interesting (to see maybe once) but there were lots of sub-plots that didn't make sense. It seems as though they couldn't decide between making it a mini-series or a movie and the end project is pretty scrambled. All and all it was an hour and a half movie crammed in to 4 hours.
2,What a disappointment,"After hearing of all the work and committment to accuracy that went into this production, and having just finished the book, I had high expectations for the film. Far too high, I'm afraid. Not only did the production virtually strip out the Union officers, it portrayed the remaining Confederate offcers in two dimensions. I was so disappointed, I didn't even finish the video. To it's credit, the unpaid Civil War re-enactors did a fine job portraying the battles. Beyond that, the movie doesn't do the book or the characters the justice they deserve. Do yourself a favor and spend your three hours starting the book - you'll have a tough time putting it down."
2,Incomplete and way too long!!,"It's a good thing I watched the Ken Burns documentary, ""The Civil War"" or else this film would have been a star less. This movie is way too long. The film should have been cut down by about 1 and a 1/2 hours. I would have also liked to have seen the Jeff Daniels' character taken out and concentrated more on the Confederate generals relationships further. The battlefield sequences were well done and could have used more blood and graphic depictions to show how real war is. Overall, there are better films out there that do a much better job in telling the story of the Civil War such as the outstanding film, ""Glory"" or the controversial ""The Birth of a Nation"". ""Gods and Generals"" could have been a much better film."
2,Very disappointing....,"I completely expected to love this movie. I'm a proud Southerner with a passion for Civil War history (or ANY history, for that matter). But watching this movie actually made me squirm in my seat, I felt so sorry for the actors. I guess they did the best with what they had, but the script seemed terribly ""plastic"" and unrealistic. It was one speech after another about the importance of honor, or the Confederacy, or love, or some other grand notion. Life just isn't like that, especially during war time. I can't imagine that anyone ever really talked that way! Compare it with Cold Mountain, which excellently shows the human struggle to maintain honor amidst the horrors of war. In ""Gods and Generals"", the writers just tried too hard. SHOW us honor, don't just TELL us about it. SHOW us love, don't just TALK about it. Very awkward. See Cold Mountain instead, if you're a Civil War buff."
1,Boring attempt to poeticize the confederacy,"This movie is a tiresome, pompous, boring, and ridiculous attempt to poeticize the confederacy.Other than modern confederate diehards, no sane viewer will want to slog through this morass. To get an idea of how unanimously critics have panned this film, visit rottentomatoes.comI'm sorry I wasted money and time watching Gods and Generals. I hung in there as long as I could, waiting for a balanced view of the Civil War to develop. Save yourselves the agony."
1,Painfully bad,"As is obvious, the only people who like this movie are reenactors and Lost cause enthusiasts. The movie itself has absolutely no connection with history. It is filled with scenes that never happened, invented by the moviemakers in an attempt to re-write history. No matter what some of these reviewers say, the moviemakers editted the rather large mention of slavery from Virginia's secession declaration, again in an attempt to portray secession as something it wasn't. As a movie, it is a complete failure, a series of bloated, neo-Victorian speeches wrapped up in a gauze of self-importance. The moviemakers claimed that it failed in the theaters because of a liberal conspiracy. Yeah, liberal as in an appreciation for good movies."
2,The Civil War at its most boring....,"I enjoy Civil War movies. I've read more books on this war than I can possibly count. I've spoken with The Late Shelby Foote, David Stroud and a number of other prominant Civil War writers. So the subject matter was flat out interesting. I was excited to see this movie. Especially after Gettysburg. This movie, however, paled in comparison to just about every movie I've ever seen on this subject. It was boring, poorly edited and the dialog was contrived and unbelievable, not to mention unmotivated. You're in a WAR! That's your motivation!The ensemble cast includes giants such as Jeff Daniels and Robert Duvall. But the casting of several others failed to meet the mastery that was Gettysburg.This movie was a monumental failure and one that is not likely to be repeated."
2,"Good Premise, poorly executed","The historical aspects were fairly accurate, but the acting was so poor that it detracted from the story. It was almost like the actors were reading from a teleprompter"
2,Disappointed! I hoped for much more.,"Not nearly as good as ""Gettysburg"". Much of the movie was booooring ...... The battle scenes not nearly as good as say ""Band of Brothers"" or even ""Gettysburg"".Depicts the southern actors as having a moral blind spot to the whole issue of slavery - hardly ever mentioned in the movie.Rent before you buy. Seeing it once will probably be enough."
4,Gods and Generals,"The historical nature of this film was excellent. The focus on the war career of Stonewall Jackson made me admire him, even if he fought for a failing cause. The lack of competancy of Northern generals was tragic; as they sent many a brave man to his death for no reason. Men like Mclellen and Burnside lacked imagination and cunning. Please don't assume that I'm a closet Confederate. I'm simply judging the Civil War from the military perpective, not political. This movie was long. Maybe it tried to cover too much and it's sad that the battles of Second Bull Run and Antietem were ignored."
3,HIstorically accurate and enlightening,"More than anything else, Gods and Generals is a history lesson, with great attention by the movie staff to accuracy of details. Stephen Lang portrayed Stonewall Jackson as I had envisioned the real man, a religious fanatic, an eccentric soldier, and a devoted husband. Indeed the acting and dialogue were not as brilliantly accomplished as was in Gettysburg, and Robert Duvall's role as Robert E. Lee was not convincing. However, the movie offers a great education in actual civil war events and the people that lived the time. I highly recommend this movie for everyone in the family."
3,What were they thinking?,"The battle scenes are very good. But the rest of the movie is God 'n Awful. Steven Lang is a good actor,but he should have had something more to work with. The one prayer missing was the one to the Almighty to put a quick end to the movie. Obviously Ron Maxwell did not have a clue as to how to adapt Shaara's book to the screen. For a time I felt I was going into hyperspace, Manasass-Fredericksburg in a single bound, with but a fleeting mention ov the Valley.There was no point to the movie except maybe to get Ted and the boys back together or to slowly develop Ted's acting career. I wonder if he's getting some sort of tax write-off.It was sad, sad ,sad to see Jeff Daniels, Patrick Gorman , and Bo Brinkman reprise their roles 10+ years later. Tom Berenger apparently was the only one with enough sense not to mess with Father Time. Ditto Martin Sheen, who brought much more to Lee than a staid/frumpy Robert Duval.Ron, stop the madness. Don't do ""The Last Full Measure"""
2,"Civil War buff, highly disappointed","I've been to Gettysburg eight times and many other battlefields, I've seen the Movie ""Gettysburg"" over 200 times and read the book Gods and Generals three times, after the release of this movie was pushed back a half year, seening it was a lifetime disappointment. This movie was a four hour, boring, and without a plot. Important characters were left out, The srceenplay was nothing like the book, They even left out the bloodest battle of the war. It contained long speeches that went no where. To sum it up, After Years of waiting to see this I couldn't wait for it to be over. It was a disappointment of a lifetime."
3,The Civil War interrupts Stonewall Jackson's prayers,"Gods and Generals is the movie adaption of Jeff Shaara's bestselling book, that simply doesn't work. The movie is way too pro-southern and by taking out most of the Winfield Hancock parts of the book from the movie, the Union perspective is left out until Chamberlain arrives. The battles are indeed accurate and well done, but overall this movie lacks the emotional punch of Gettysburg and is not really all that accurate in describing the moods of the north. This limits the ability of the movie to provide an accurate look at the Civil War. Plus, the fact that several key battles were filmed yet never show up in the DVD release earns this movie a 3 star rating. If you want a movie on the Civil War watch Gettysburg."
1,Read the book,"I have been reading about the Civil War for over 40 years and have been a reenactor / living historian for over 10 years. I really looked forward to seeing this movie. Having seen it, I now encourage others not to. It is very boring and many of the ""stars"" overacted, especially the overdone scenes with General Thomas Jackson. These were so bad that in all the years I have been going to the movies I have never been so happy to see someone die on screen. It was also interesting to see not what was shown on screen but what was left out. Almost makes me think the screen writers had a message they wanted to get across."
2,It would have been a great radio show,"This Robert Duvall vehicle to eternal boredom is guaranteed to drive you straight there! What could have been a sensational visual epic turns out to be little more than Ted Turner indulging his liberal views through long and protracted dialogue that will put the viewer to sleep. There is little action, and what there is remains muted and surreal. As a Civil War buff, I anxiously awaited the release of this film only to be disappointed by its lack of enthusiasm for all but the dialogue."
1,Despair,"The movie's only redeeming feature is the Battle of Fredericksburg sequence. I don't understand how this rousing, highly credible portrayal of the battle could have been buried in a mind-numbing succession of clunky monologues and bad cinematography. Rent the video, fast forward to Fredericksburg and avoid the misery of the rest of the movie."
1,Terrible,"The worst dialog, battle scenes, and acting of any civil war film. Even Robert Duvall's performance is weak. This stinker isn't worth buying in any format."
1,"Gods & Generals...? How about ""Sermons & Speeches!""","This film is too preachy and boring to be of any interest to anyone (except perhaps the re-enactors who participated in it). English films are short on action, but they capture the time period with a feeling of authenticity that ""Gods & Generals"" sorely lacks. The dialoge in this film is so painfully stiff and unnatural that it becomes a burden to sit through it. I was also bothered by the depiction of slaves as happy, faithful servants who love their masters more than freedom...Not since ""Gone With The Wind"" have I seen something so awkwardly insensitive. I'm still waiting for a realistic, well acted, and well crafted Civil War epic."
1,No where near his father's writing,"We felt the book was pretentious - no real depth to the story. A weakness as some characters were not as prominent in the same time period. We loved Joshua Chamberlain, but would have liked to see a focus on someone else who was as notable as Stonewall Jackson, but from the Union side."
1,The worst MOVIE that i've ever seen,"Like i said this verywell has to be the worst film in the long history of films. I mean this is ""Dude, Wheres my car"" bad. The acting was just terrible. The aspects of the scenes were terrible. And the mistakes in the film were just unbearable.For instance at one point of this four-hour piece of [trash] i saw someone wearing a purple baseball cap. With all that in the regular movie I was just waiting to see the blooper reel.And anyone who says that Jeff Daniels was good, wasn't awake for the whole thing. Because every now and then you here the classic voice of Harry from ""Dumb & Dumber"".So what i'm really trying to tell everyone is to spend 20 or so dollars on something worth watching!"
3,"revisionism, romance and a curious disappointment","For those, like Mr.Vallante who thinks that this movie gave aview of what the view of the South was, a Civil War movie shouldgive the views of both the South and the North. Like it's pre/post quel, Gettysburg, there is a romanticising of the South.The persons are quite clean and pristine, and the slaves are welldressed and of course, quite satisfied.Sorry, but the amazon initial review betrays the fact that there are not only misguided priorities, but that it really is valuable for the study of the Civil War, as to see the difference between history and romance.The portral of Jackson was quite interesting nevertheless, and especially his moving tribute to his first brigade-which should at least be watched by military commanders to see how a good speech can move military men.One wonders whether Jackson would have had a prayer withhis cook, a slave."
1,"Pathetic, maudlin, prequel to "" Gettysburg "" full of nonsensical religiuosity...","I paid 5 dollars for this loser in the Walmart cheapy bin. It was money wasted. I very much enjoyed "" Gettysburg "" and that is why I bought it. Says "" from the same director "" on the jacket, whatever that means. If you enjoy maudlin with pointless religiousity, you might sort of enjoy this film. I don`t know. They lay it on thick. Do not expect the same action filled adventure of GETTYSBURG. Not worth watching. ...Oscar"
1,Lost Opportunity for the Lost Cause,"I'm a lover of Civil War history and could barely sit through this one - to say there was poor editing would be an understatement. The surrender of Harper's Ferry to Jackson right before Sharpsburg, the last minute arrivial of A.P. Hill could have been done with excellent effect instead of the overly long Fredericksburg episode, which as a battle was inconclusive to both sides. Very unfortunate - a lost opportunity to tell a great story."
2,Very disappointing...,"It's hard for me to describe how disappointed I was with this film. I mean, fine, General Jackson was a very religious man. He put his trust in God and Heaven and feared not death. But this doesn't make good film! The scenes with the General praying drags out and gets so boring that it makes you wonder if it really is a war movie or a churchschool-movie... I was bored beyond belief. The reason for that I gave two stars in stead of one is because of the battle scenes. They really show (except the Manassas scenes) how the Confederate Army under leadership of General Lee gave the Yankee invaders a serious whooping! Other than that the movie is a sad, sad attempt on making a good Civil War movie... I really wish that I could say that I liked this movie, but sadly I really didn't..."
1,As painful as a battlefield amputation.,"For what it is worth (maybe nothing), I will be honest and admit that I could only bear to watch the first hour or so of this turgid mess. The battle scene I saw was quite well done, but everything else was slow, preachy, and painfully obvious. It is a sad movie when the extras (probably Civil War reenactors who do this sort of thing on the weekends) were more engaging than the main characters. The dialog was stilted, and the actors gave us neither grand passion nor subtlety. I would've given it ""zero"" stars, but that wasn't an option."
1,"Awful, awful movie","Beards that resemble badgers on chins and way too much religion in this overbrown civil war epic. History buffs may like to watch but those who appreciate acting & writing should stay away. Ah, them happy slaves..oh, they overlooked that story! Too many re-enactors who cannot act or react & constantly look at the camera as they fall dead. Duvall great as Lee but hardly in the film. If I saw Stonewall Jackson character look up & pray to heaven one more time, I'da soiled my pants.Director has 4 more hours on cutting room floor. Please, please do not release them on DVD!"
2,What is up with all of the religious pontification?,"I live in the Capital of the Confederacy so naturally I awaited with great anticipation the release of Gods and Generals. What a waste of over 3 1/2 hours. The battle scenes were good, but the story lines never get developed nor do the characters. Rather I am left with the feeling that I watched Thomas Jackson lead sermon and quote scripture for two hours of the movie. Not what I expected at all. Jackson may have been an EXTREMELY pious man and have been compelled to feel as though he were serving God's will by casting out the invading horde (the Federals), but the movie gets lost in the constant dialogue to this end. Truly lost unfortunately. Do yourselves a favor and pick up the book instead."
1,Worst of the Worst,"If you like movies, if you're interested in the Civil War, if you want to spend 4 happy hours... avoid this film like the plague. Even Robert Duvall turns in a sub-standard performance. The costumes, dialogue, fakey battles, and slavery-glorifying plot are pathetic. This is a wicked bad waste of time."
2,You'll fall asleep in your popcorn.,"This movie gives dry, ponderous movies a bad name. The acting was quite good, but the writers only gave the actors long, boring speeches to enact. And if I'd had to watch Stonewall Jackson pray one more time, I might not have made it through. Okay, he was devout, I get it. Let's not belabor the point.If you've seen Gettysburg (a far superior film) and haven't seen this one, just picture Gettysburg with the historical battle scenes cut to about a tenth of the film and the other 9/10ths consisting of those slow scenes from Gettysburg when the generals were going on and on about so many of their friends being on the other side. That's Gods and Generals."
2,Bad. Just bad. No all bad. But pretty bad.,"I loved Gettysburg. For me that remains the best Civil War movie yet made. I very much looked forward to Gods and Generals coming out in the threatre, and I dragged several friends along to see it.I was embarassed. First let me say, the parts with Jeff Daniels were well done - he's an excellent actor.However, every scene with General and Mrs. Jackson made me ill. They were poorly scripted and poorly acted. It was like an overly melodramatic Bugs Bunny cartoon, but not funny. The whole script seemed to focus more on melodrama than on making the characters seem real and genuine, as they were in GettysburgI'm wondering if the problem has to do with the book's author. I have read historic books by Jeff Shaara, and he is not a great writer - his historical facts tend to be wrong, among other things."
4,Good Effort,"I thought the movie was a very worthy effort and well done, except for the few inaccuracies that every historical movie tends to have. Over all good. It's a shame that a few reviewers most notably the gentleman from Freemont CA. does not have a true understanding of history. It is true the war was at first not over slavery. However the South never had the right to succeed and if they had not been so adoment about slavery and their right to continue it, the Civil War would most likely not have happened. The economic problems and most others could have been solved eventually without a shot being fired. Slavery was wrong and they simply refused to except that their way of live had to change. It's amazing how we expected the Indians to except the change we forced on them, yet it was considered so horrible that the South's dying life style had to change. I am a major student of Civil War history and thought I would lend my opinion to those of others."
3,Not Gettysburg and Turner Ruined It....,"This movie has some ""good"" but is disappointing otherwise. I looked forward to it after seeing Gettysburg and reading the book by Jeff Shara....First, the ""Good""....the battles of First Manassas and Fredericksburg are WELL DONE. Jeff Daniels is excellent once again as Colonel Joshua Chamberlain. I felt the movie couldc have been a biography of Stonewall Jackson....and I felt his story was compelling.I HATED Ted Turner's cameo....A WASTED scene and WORTHLESS.....really added nothing but the sense of ""HOKUM""....Gettysburg is a beeter film, becdause its focused....this film suffers from an attempt by Maxwell to cover three battles,plus a biography in one movie.....If you are a Civil War buff its FINE overall,but if you enjoyed Gettysburg....you may be disappointed. I was.Atreides"
5,Excellent,"This is a great war film. You feel that you were at the charge at 1st Manassas, or alongside with the Irish Brigade as they bravely try to reach Marye's Heights at the battle of Fredericksburg. Chancellorsville was good as well but could've been longer. Duvall is outstanding as Lee and makes you think that he is Lee. Lang's performance as Stonewall Jackson is stupendous and really deserves and deserves an oscar at the academy awards. Jeff Daniels is good as well. After reading the reviews from the critics, it was obvious that they did'nt see the entire movie or don't know ANYTHING about the Civil War. The songs from Bob Dylan and Mary Fahl really deserve an oscar nomination. I just hope the six-hour version gets here soon, I'm dying to see it!"
4,outstanding,"Although told mostly from the southern side it suceeds in telling the story of the first few years of the war. In this movie it shows the union forces geting their butts kicked for the most part, as it actually happened. The movie takes us up to a couple of months before Gettysburg, the turning point of the war. Not unlike the revolutionary war, the side that ultimately won lost most of the battles but won the war."
5,"Finally, A Movie From A Southern Viewpoint","Gods and Generals is one of the greatest war movies I have ever seen. I am glad to see a movie that portrays the true history of the war and not the Yankee textbook version of the war. People need to understand that the South was not fighting for slavery and the North was not fighting to abolish slavery. 98% of Southerners did not own slaves. Why would they fight for something that they did not own? Anyway, there are always 2 versions to a story. People taught in public and most private schools only know one version of the story. This movie is a great way to see and understand the 2nd version of the story, the Southern version. Also check out the book Gods and Generals by Jeff Shaara, son of Micheal Shaara (The author of Killer Angels which inspired the movie Gettysburg)"
4,"I'm a Yankee, But I loved this movie!","I rented this movie because I wanted to see Gettysburg, but I wanted to see the first movie first, plus my uncle worked on the set. I thought the movie was excellent, but Jackson's religous preaching did get on my nerves a little. The battle scenes were very well done and made child-safe, but during the battle of Bull Run, I noticed one scene of Confederate soldiers advancing was used 3 times. I even found it sort of funny when Stonewall was shot in the hand and rode by his soldiers, it made him look like he was giving the fingers. I loved this movie and plan to buy it soon."
3,I wanted to love this movie but.....,"Having read the book trilogy by the Shaara's, I was really looking forward to this movie. However, it came up short. I felt detached throughout, not like in the book where the reader was really thinking along with the generals. The movie is long personal soliloquies followed by the battle scenes. Strategy is rarely discussed. Why are the armies where they are? Who has the upper hand? These things are rarely discussed. The movie jumps from Monassas to Fredericksburg (1.5 yrs. in between) with no mention of what happened in between. I'm afraid that people who haven't read the book or don't have civil war knowledge will feel lost. Gettysburg is the far better movie. This is a solid movie but as so often happens leaves the book reader disappointed with the translation from book to movie."
3,Did not meet my expectations based upon viewing Getttysburg first.,I did enjoy the movie however having watched Gettysburg first to me Gods and Generals was a let down however the book was good.
3,"Too long, don't buy director's cut",We enjoyed the movie at the theatre when it came out but the Director's Cut was too long and boring in many scenes.
2,Could have been much better - disappointing,"This is a B movie - very disappointing. Jackson is portrayed well, but the portrayal of Lee is awful. Some of the lines are part lie/part truth - especially dislike the change of what Jackson said on his deathbed. The truth would have been just as moving. People may enjoy the movie if they are not as knowledgeable. On the whole, a waste of good actors in a slow, somewhat artificial feeling movie."
2,Alas!,"If ever there was a film that is less than the sum of its parts, this is it. Excellent visuals, good acting, painstaking historical accuracy (down to details like Gen. Jackson being wounded in the finger at 1st Bull Run), a noble and inspiring topic... and this turkey comes out of it. I am a military historian and, while not a Civil War ""buff,"" have a strong interest in the topic. But I was sadly disappointed. General Lee is a bit part. There is too much on Jackson, and too much of what there is focuses on his eccentricities (about which, I suppose, a whole film could be made). And why Fredericksburg, for heaven's sakes? A painfully dull battle that could have only one outcome, given Burnside's idiotic plan. Why not Antietam? This poor movie--it could have been so wonderful (as Gettysburg is). Probably that's the problem: they tried to do too much. Still, it has some excellent scenes."
2,So Long - So Dull. All Most like the War...,"Compared to Gettysburg, this movie is a flop. It's long, dull, drawn out, and it is astonishing to me that anyone in the South ever had children if all they ever did (according to this movie's depictations) ever did is snuggle in bed with full nighshirts/gowns on and talk. While I wasn't expecting all out sex, for krimminie's sake, let's see some passion -- even in the acting!This movie could have been half the length and probably have suffered little in the cut. God help us if the third installment is this bad. Forget this dud and watch Gettysburg, instead."
1,Agendas Make For Bad History and Bad Movies,"The attempt to paint the slaves as being sympathetic to their masters is really just disgusting. Also, making the North, the real country, out to be just a bunch of money grubbing fools is really so far off the mark that it makes this movie into a comedy. Yes, Ted Turner grew up in the south and thinks the people who committed treason against their country such as Robert E. Lee are heroes. No, pretending that the South had it right on this one is not even close to the truth. This movie doesn't even come close to being anything historically, and worse than that it is a cinematic joke, over written, sentimental and over produced."
1,Unrateable,"The usually brilliant Robert Duvall should have walked away from this one. If it is the first of a trilogy, the rest should not be made. Such direction I have never seen. The action moves as if all the actors have wooden legs. And the dialog would have been better in King James English. There is not one believable character in the whole film. One could make more realistic battle action with toy soldiers. History could never have been this boring."
1,Tedious!,"""Gods and Generals"" is as bad a movie as its counterpart ""Gettysburg"" is great. While the movie may try to convey the opposing mindsets of the northern abolitionists, and the souther slave-holders, the dialog through which they present their opinions is hard to watch without feeling insulted.The only saving grace in the movie (as far as I care to recall) is Robert Duvall's adept and nuanced portrayal of General Robert E. Lee."
1,Extremely disappointing,I liked the movie Gettysburg and was excited about seeing this one. Almost every bit of dialogue ended up being a speech. Acting was awful....but some of that can probably attributed to whoever wrote the script because it was a horrid script.
1,Don't buy it,"Gods and Generals is one of the worst movies ever made. Gettysburg was an outstanding film. Sadly this one isn't even close. It is long winded, boring, and biased toward the south. The Stonewall Jackson story line is not compelling yet Maxwell features the film around it. Save your money."
2,Propaganda for the Confederacy,"I believe this entire film was made for the sole purpose of getting sympathy to the Cofederacy. Most of the story follows Stonewall Jackson and the story is way too drawn out. The only good part is the battle seens but they do not totally show the grusomeness of war. Anyone who promotes this crap must be a rebel. Creighton Lovelace should be arrested for treason in his idea of a returning Confederate States of America. Guess what, I am a Yankee and an American. You southerners need to stop all this Confederate flag debates and bumber stickers. You should be honoring the country you live and not try to destroy it. Leave the country or honor it. And this movie needs to be trashed."
1,These reviews are all about the first version of the movie,"These reviews are all about the first version of the movie. The newly released directors cut is an abomination and a total destruction of the film. It has been entirely re-edited and tells a different story which will be repugnant to all Southerners. The role of Stonewall Jackson has been much diminished and the role of Joshua Chamberlain, much enhanced compared to the original. Plus a new series of scenes with John Wilkes Booth has been added that have absolutely nothing to do with the story. Don't buy it if you are from the South as it continues the Yankee's Great Myth and the Great Lie about the War for Southern Independence.Roy Norris"
1,wildly inaccurate but mostly just slow,"No matter how much the revisionists may want to say otherwise, this movie is not historically accurate on hardly anything it portrays. But to me its biggest problem is just that it's so boring I could hardly make it through to the end. Save your money."
1,This Was a BAD MOVIE!,"This was a bad movie...bottom line! I really don't understand why they even bothered to portray an important piece of American history so badly. I can explain the movie in three sentances:1. More like a play, with old men (bad actors) talking and deciding and then going off onto a battle won by one side or another, persistantly, throughout the movie.2. FOUR HOURS!3. There is no bad side or good side, because...God is on both sides, therefore canceling the point.I don't exactly know how to explain it fully within one review, but all I can say is that if you want to see a movie that's about two sides battling it out, with the movie makers trying to film it from both perspectives in a way that makes it confusing, pointless and boring, and a movie that's four hours long (including the intermission) then go ahead, watch this. But if not, be glad because then you can watch actually good movies like, say, ""Good Will Hunting!""Bottom Line: FOUR HOURS!!! (I give it an F)"
5,Ammendment to my earlier review,"I said in 2003 that the Score was terribly disappointing. I wish to ammend that---It grows on one. Try not to go into it with a ""Gettysburg"" mindset."
2,Not Quite As It Was,"While the movie is very stunning to watch, it avoids many parts of the Civil War. It is very sanitized. Where is the death from disease, accidents and starvation? I also couldn't believe how clean and beautiful the soldiers were in their uniforms. All the weapons worked perfectly. This is NOT the way it really was. Just check the pension files of some real Civil War Veterans and you'll find out how things really were."
3,Ken Burns did it better,"Entirely too biased to the south, unbelievable portrayal of slavery. Not enough material on Antietam the Western front,Lincoln and the various problems with McClellan etal."
1,Poor Excuse for Anything,"I will begin by saying that I'm proud to call ""Gettysburg"" my favorite movie. I'm also proud to say that this film has to be my least favorite. This film simply makes me want to vomit. It's the most pathetic excuse for a movie I've ever seen, not to mention a Civil War film. The only thing this movie had going for it war Robert Duvall's portrayal of Lee. It would have added merrit to ""Gettysburg"". Unfortunately, he was cast for this flop. I'm a Civil War historian, reenactor, collector, and fellow reenactors of mine, who were actually in the movie, also agree that this has to be the worst film ever made. It would be right at home in any high school auditorium stage or some ""lost cause"" fanatic's DVD collection."
2,Disappointment,"The movie Gettysburg was a faithful onscreen rendition of Michael Shaara's The Killer Angels. Grant it - transferring Gods and Generals to the big screen was more of a challenge. Gettysburg took place in three days, Gods spans years. Having said that, there is no other way to describe this movie other than disappointing. Here's three reasons. First - NO ANTIETAM. How can you depict the first half of the Civil Ware and SKIP SHARPSBURG! Stunning omission! Second - the acting was contrived and overly dramatic. Although Gettysburg did show signs of this, Gods went overboard. Like a very bad made for TV movie. Third - absolute unacceptable use of computer graphics. I want to like this movie. However, it is awkward to watch and at times downright painful. Ron Maxwell should say, ""It's all my fault!"""
3,quite good,"I am not a civil war buff and did not see this film in the theater, but watching it on DVD at a friends house made me want to see the film Gettysburg. I'm not a Jeff Daniels fan as a rule, but I greatly enjoyed his performance here. I also thought Robert Duval did a fine job as Lee. The battle scenes were quite believable and exciting. God's and Generals is very enjoyable and I wouldn't mind watching it again."
4,Sweeping Yet Human,"Overall, a very watchable film and certainly a must for Civil War buffs.I felt, however, that this installment was inferior to its predecessor, Gettysburg. The script, cast, and editing of Gettysburg were much tighter and finely honed than here. The style of speech is not the problem in Gods & Generals, its the lenght and cheesy sentimentality; Chamberlain's speech quoting from Julius Caesar, for example, is over the top and unnecessary. Yes, the treatment of slaves is a bit PC and soft but within the realm of reality.While this film is about conflict and resolution, it is precisely this quality that falls short with respect to the people in the film: conflict and resolution between individuals and within individuals. This was done so much better in Gettysburg. Overall, I'd say that, buoyed by the success of Gettysburg, the director just tried too hard.The criticisms and weaknesses aside, it is still a fine film."
3,Less than engagaing....,"The trailer and the storyline looked great. I am both a Civil War buff and a huge Robert Duvall fan. I saw this film last night and the biggest problem I had with this movie was that it was hard for me to become involved with the characters. We saw men leaving thier families, but we didn't see how that directly impacted that family, either from an economic or social standpoint. We knew that brothers fought against brothers and friend against friend, but we didn't get to see who those people were and how it impacted thier lives. However it seemed to me the biggest problem with the film is that it seemed to breakdown into a storyline of speech-battle-speech-battle,etc. Even when there intimate conversations between husband and wife, that also seemed to turn into a speech. The special effects were less than convincing. Glory still remains the best Civil War movie for me."
4,Big Improvement,"This new ""director's cut"" is a big improvement over the theatrical release. Historical inaccuracies (Lee riding a horse at Antietam, Lee looking down at Sharpsburg from the wrong side of the river, slaves viewed more as members of the family than, well, slaves) remain, but the less the film focuses on Jackson, the better. Visually, it looks great. Unfortunately, there's no way to free the film from the characters speechifying at each other rather than talking. This goes well beyond the normal ""dialogue as conveying facts to the audience"" that inflicts many historical films. The worst example is still Jeff Daniels reciting some lengthy Roman text out loud while waiting to go into action at Fredricksburg. Even family members interact with discourses that would make a thespian blush."
1,Save Your Money--,"The acting was weak, and the director took a subject that was filled with drama and distilled it into being trite. Moreover, the video was historically inaccurate, with a distinct bias toward the Confederate States, not unexpected since Ted Turner bankrolled the film and has a bit part as a Confederate officer. I wish I could say it was on the whole entertaining, but alas it is not. Read the Shaara book--it is well written and dramatic enough."
2,"God-Awful, and Generally Boring!","Never thought I'd be bored with a Shaara-inspired Civil War epic, but this DVD was a huge disappointment. Bad beards all around, a turgid storyline, and the film didn't hold a candle to the book. Some of the special features included with the DVD were okay, especially interesting to my non-Civil War literate spouse. I own ""Gettysburg"", and use it as a teaching tool, but there was nothing even remotely as inspiring in G & G. (Not even Ted Turner's vanity role!) Save your money, and buy the books!"
2,Plods and generally tedious.,"Yea, I didst valiantly and with much anticipation embark upon the viewing of this mighty Civil War motion picture epic, but as I doth sat and pondered my fate the sand in the hour glass moved ever more slowly until I found myself gripped with the growing trepidation that perhaps I might be subjected to an endless concatenation of bombastic utterances such as this one.So, I pulled the DVD after watching a bit more than an hour and decided to watch something else. Usually I wouldn't give even two stars to a movie that I survived less than half of, but I suppose that if someone had a great interest in Civil War history they might be more patient than I was and would get a lot more out of this movie."
2,Too much praying,"This is a truly authentic film. The depiction of battle scenes was realistic. The problem: General (Stonewall) Jackson praying that the Lord would give him the victory reminds me of the Old Testament where God is supposed to sanction butchering, rapes and slaughter. This is too much doggie-doo! But he does add ""thy will be done ...""In the end, after all his praying, he dies anyway of pneumonia and other wounds. What a relief!!Some day Hollywood will wake up and leave God out of these war films."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money...,"..with this propagandistic piece of southern revisionist bull excrement! Do your self a favor and get Ken Burns' documentary or better yet read a book. The idolatry of Stonewall Jackson in this ""film"" is truly nauseating - in reality he was the 19th century version of a jihadi. This film buys so deeply into the imbecilic mythology of ""the southern cause"" that it borders on full fiction. Those southern generals (traitors by the way) were only good because of the shear incompetence of their northern counterparts - Mrs. Lee could have beaten Burnside and McClellan. Reality check for those of you who chug the Kool-Aid - the south started the war, the north ended it and the Confederacy got what it deserved - ruin and Reconstruction! Huzzah to Sherman and his March to the Sea!"
1,Boring and revisionist,"Did the people who made this bother to research their history? The history in this reminds of a friend of mine who was teaching history in South Carolina and the book said the South WON the Civil War. In another review, someone was wondering what America would have been like if the South had indeed won. Duh - slavery, discrimination, hatred of others, no progress. The south was a backwards culture. They even still had jousts for entertainment in some places because they longed for the ""good old day"". No, if the South had won, America would have been a nightmare of a place. The question would then have been - whose side would the C.S.A. been on in World War II/"
1,Horrible Movie,"As a Jeff Shaara fan, I can say that this movie is horrible, even worse than Gettysburg, which was also a Turner B-flick. Painfully slow, and drawn out with incredibly dull directing through all the non-action scenes, which are about 90% of the film. I was skipping through a lot of it to get to the battles after a while. Since some of the actors are very talented, I have to assume it was the the script and directing that made this so painful to watch. Although some of the acting by actors/actresses I wasn't familiar with seemed to be at a high-school drama class level. The only decent portrayal was Robert Duvall as General Lee. Other than that, yuck."
2,"Oh my, did that ever suck!","Aside from the special effects that looked like something out of a ten dollar video game, the fact the actors aged considerably (and had far much less enthusiasm) from the Gettysburg epic the movie just stank up the entire theater and the one next-door. Steven Lang was Pickett, and watching him as Jackson was a tough transition. Then there was the glossing over of the slavery issue. The movie seemed to imply ""it wasn't bad, we were all friends, had the slaves on up to dinner and sat around and sang like birds"". Casting the aristocracy of the South in a beneficent role in slavery does a disservice to us all. I never cared for Turner but this travesty is an all time new low even for ""Mr. Colorization"". As interested as I am in the Civil War if he's stupid enough to put this piece of ... out on video it'll be easy to pass by."
1,A Bad CD,I received the CD witch the seller said ( It is used in good condition).I noticed that the CD had an excessive amount of scratches on it. I tried to play the CD but it would not play after it hit the scratches. I find it hard to believe that a person could sell a CD in such bad condition on Amazon. The seller did E MAIL me a return label and I return the CD on 05/07/09. As of this date I have not heard anything about a credit or apology for sending me a BAD PRODUCT
2,Director's conceit,"Way too long, way too boring. Even the battle scenes were boring. The generals constantly be searching god were boring. Nuff said."
1,Gods And Generals VHS version (only),"Do NOT buy the VHS version of ""Gods And Generals"".Buy it on DVD.It's a great movie.But whoever edited the VHS version -when there is a person on the right and one on the left of the screen,instead of showing both,this person picked one or the other and left the other half of the screen completely missing.Terrible editing for the VHS format.Buy ""Gods And Generals"" on DVD,or BluRay."
2,Not Gettysburg,"Watched the first hour and had enough, its not very good. Just watch gettysburg instead. I know i watched for one hour, but for me a history buff not to keep going it means its bad."
4,"Very good, not great","I went to see the movie on opening day. I have been looking forward to seeing this film for a couple of years. I am a big Shaara fan and his books are outstanding. I was disappointed right from the opening scene when I immediately recognized that about a third of the book had been left out of the movie. I don't feel that the movie lead us into Gettysburg very well. There was not enough about Hancock, Champerlain, and Lee in the movie. Leaving out the pre-war material and skiping so much that was in the book weakened the movie and kept it from having a good flow.The movie should have been called the Stonewall Jackson story. That would have made me enter the theater not knowing what to expect. I did enjoy the movie, but like I said, I was expecting a movie based on Jeff Shaara's book and in that sense I was disapointed."
3,Sloppy editing; overacting,"The movie was poorly edited. Several times we see the same shot over and over again. We see the Union soldiers carrying back the injured and you can tell it's the same actors again and again. They just repeated the scene. Panning across the stone wall you see every 5th person get hit. Each person dies with the most overdramatic movements I've seen, reaching to the camera. The plot is mild. The thought of making a proper civil war movie was nice, but you can't have the extras fooling around in the back of a shot. If they didn't repeat scenes they wouldn't need to have an intermission. Watch it on a rainy day rented from the local video store."
4,"Good, but could have been better","A fabulous portrayal of the war and the human side of the men who fought it. If the film has a fault, it's the effort to portray the humanity, which sometimes becomes a bit boring and bogs down in places. The performances are excellent, and the dialogue, although decried by some critics (who obviously don't realize these are DIRECT QUOTES), is authentic and gives us insight into the motivations of the men who fought - and the truth that for the majority of the soldiers, the cause wasn't slavery. Could have been better; impossible not to give an accurate portrayal of the war by leaving out the carnage of Sharpsburg/Antietam. Still, should be required viewing for any serious student of the War and the period."
2,Simply not Gettsyburg,"I looked forward to this DVD as I had really enjoyed Gettysburg. While Gettysburg was spectacular, this DVD was just plain average. The first hour could have been cut down to about 15 minutes without the hokey dialogue between Stonwall Jackson and himself, and God. This DVD is the Southern Apologetic for the Civil War on a much grander scale than Gettsyburg, which was much more fair and balanced. The good parts to this DVD were the movie camerawork was brilliant, but it just moved along way too slow. A smaller version may have been a lot better.Joseph Dworak"
2,What happened to Antietam??,"Although the photography in this movie is breathtaking, I can't recommend it. It seems to me as if Ted Turner is trying to rewrite the history of the Civil War, only this time the South wins. Purportedly, this is the prequel to ""Gettysburg,"" but a major battle is missing -- Antietam. The only major battle in the East which the North won before Gettysburg, yet it is completely omitted from the movie. How can this movie be historically accurate when a major battle is omitted?"
3,Stonewall and some other people!,"This movie was good, but it was full of sound bites and ""grandiose speeches for posterity"" dialogue. It centered on Stonewall Jackson's pious faith in God. It seemed that Robert Duvall, was just a ""special appearance"" character for his short role in the film. The rest was history, as history is written,with good battle scenes and great re-enactments. I hope the next movie is an improvement from this one."
2,Gods & Generally Boring,"Some 10 years after a good effort with Gettysburg, director R. Maxwell tries to comply with Turner's wishes to make an 'anti-war' war movie. Instead he made an 'anti-viewer' movie. Lang's talent is wasted trying to cope with the stilted dialog of a 19th Century version of a Shakespearian drama. While generally true that both the North & the South thought they had God on their side, I suspect that there was quite a lot more on their minds during the day than discussing Old Testament passages and looking up into the night sky to discern the mind of God. And what was the special effects cloud routine near the end of the battle of Fredericksburg all about? Even a good cast couldn't defeat the writers and director in this tedious film."
5,classic,Excellent historical film that is one of the best Civil War films I've ever seen. I'm proud to have this on my DVD shelf next to Glory. Very well done.
1,Talk like that,"To those fans of Gettysburg, be prepared. Part of the reason that I liked Gettysburg was the way the filmmakers presented the characters, yes, I know they are real people, speaking in a plain speak. In Gods and Generals, all the characters are speaking as if a reporter were sitting in the corner or a tape recorder on the table. Every dialog was constructed as a soliloqy delivered upon a stage. I know these events were life changing and history making, but when you befuddle the actions with words dripping with life and death sincerity the message is lost. The watcher is forced to endure language rather than the display of war. The battle scenes were great I admit, but this was ruined by the tone. Shakespeare can do this, but this screenwriter(s) were trying to deliver a message that the bloody war did a fine job of doing all by itself."
1,Terrible..Terrible...Terrible,Absolutley the worse movie in terms of both acting and storytelling I have ever had seen. A ridiculous representation that doesn't warrant documenting all the problem areas. Please....save your money.
1,Horrible film!,"A bloodless reenactment with substandard acting, writing, etc! Too many speaches and not enough acting! Much worse than the first installment Gettysburg a film I enjoyed."
1,For Civil War Re-enactors ONLY,"Yes, this film has enormous attention to detail-period costumes, period weapons, period everything. However, no amount of authenticity can save it from being terribly dull, plodding and overwrought. Every line of dialogue is written and delivered as though the speaker were giving the West Point Commencement address. The film contains multiple plot lines and characters, but none of them have any clearly defined or dramatic conflict-the plot seems derived entirely from biographies and historical accounts-it's as though no attempt at crafting an actual story was made. The only thing that kept me awake was the occasional spurt of gunfire from one of the battle scenes. Save your time and money-STAY AWAY unless you dress in Confederate or Union fatigues and shoot blanks at other people every weekend."
2,Gods and Generals,"The movie of Jeff Shaara's Civil War novel of the same title.Gaaahh, this was awful! Awful!Bloodless battle scenes. Bemused, wooden Stonewall. ""Jeb Stuart"" portrayed by an actor who was such a bad rider he was dragging on his horse's mouth in a way the real Stuart would have had horsewhipped, and what was that on his face, a dead Shih Tzu? Worst Fake Beards Ever.Other than the topic being of interest to me, I can't dredge up anything good to say about this movie. I recommend WICKED SPRING, COLD MOUNTAIN and GLORY instead."
5,Great Movie!!!,"Great movie with a perspective not common in the Liberal dominated mainstream media or academia.For the lefty in CA, ""red neck"" is a racist term you biggot!!!"
5,Gods and Generals,feel like I was a part of this movie. and the extended cut gave you a better idea on the stories.
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!,"I can only echo the words of other reviewers - This is a great movie! I saw it 7 times in the theater and can't wait to own the dvd! Do not let the length of the movie deter you from seeing it. There are two outstanding things about it. Stephen Lang's performance as Thomas Jonathan Jackson is breath-taking. The musical score is hauntingly beautiful. Do yourself a favor and add ""Gods and Generals"" to your collection. You will not be disappointed."
2,Very disappointing from the book,"If you read the book, don't buy this movie for you will be very disappointed. While the movie does have it's own value entertainment, it does not follow the book very well at all. The movie does not develop the characters at all, especially the relationships between the various Generals for both sides. The book particularly hit on the close relationship between Hancock and Armistead that was never even mentioned in this movie. I actually ran into Jeff Shaara in Gettysburg a few years ago and expressed my disappoint in the movie and he expressed his disappoint in how the movie was portrayed also. It would be nice if they finished the series and did a screenplay of ""The last full measure"" but it would need to be a mini-series or at least 3 hours long."
2,Not What I Expected,"Actually, I gave Gods and Generals 2.5 stars. This film had me anxiously in wait to see but when i watched it I couldn't finish it. Few battle scenes showing no blood to get your heart pumping ruin this film along with too much attention on the Confederate army. The music was good but over dramatic compared to the horrendous acting. The details were great and the directing was so-so. See this film if you have 4 spare hours and if you aren't in the mood for a gory bloody war film."
1,Make your own choice,Watch for it on cable since it will be broadcast soon. Then make your own choice as to whether you need this DVD in your house or not. You'll be glad you waited.
1,Does not do the book justice!!!,"I had such high hopes for this movie when it came out because the books are so amazing. Unfortunately...the movie is badly cast, poorly acted, and has a bad script. It betrayed the book.Such a disappointment."
1,Not good...,"This movie isn't awful, but it's not good. I had such high hopes after Gettysburg. This movie doesn't come close!"
2,way too drawn out,"i love Civil War history and i LOVED Gettysburg, but this seemed too rambling to get my attention...I am not one to skip over scenes, but I did on this one....just to get to something interesting...and i hope they make the third one"
5,Civil War movie,"... I can trly recommend this movie. its a movie about the civil war and the army unit is called the ""2Oth from Maine Reiment"" The guy who stars is called Jeff Daniels and he was just as good - no better - in this than he was in the original ""Gettysburg"" movie. You should also try that one there is a scene he is famous for - Little Round Top. Bottom Line= long but worth it and worth every penny. I am Harold McInnes."
5,One of the best war movies I have seen,"I went to see ""Gods and ""Generals"" last night. It lasted till 11:00 PM and it had and intermission. It was probably equall to ""Saving Private Ryan"". The movie was really gory and shouldn't have been rated PG-13. The acting was excelent, and the writting was very good also. It had no big special effects, but it had a lot of fighting. If' you didn't like ""Gettysberg"", you probalby won't like this. In this movie, it focuses on the southern side most of the time. Overall this movie is probalby the best war movie I've seen (besides Saving Pvt. Ryan)."
3,Gods and Generals,"Kind of a ponderous movie but overall good. I understand that the third installment of the trilogy will not be made, and would like to see it. It wasn't that bad."
5,You gotta be a fan,"The first review written includes much information about the movie, all of which I agree with and will not repeat here. Robert Duvall is excellent as Robert E. Lee, and I also would have preferred to see him over Martin Sheen in the same role in Gettysburg. Since I cannot get enough of Civil War history presently, this movie, for all its flaws, was completely enjoyable for me."
3,Gods & Generals,"If you're a fan of Gettysburg and/or a civil war buff, this is a good addition to your collection. I like this pre-quill because it takes you back, right before the war kicked off. Faily accurate, it's showing how the confederates started off strong and the union was taking a beating (like Fredericksburg, etc.). The few things I don't like about this is the actor changes. Some came back to do this one, but you'll get used to it. I also feel that's it's drawn out a little too long. There's some spots I just want to ffwd to the next scene. Over all though, I enjoyed the movie. Bottom line, If ya own Gettysburg, ya gotta get this one!!"
3,Second to Gettysburg,"There's not much to say about Gods and Generals except that shortening the first and last half hour by about 25 minutes each would have made for a much better movie, esp. 1/2 hour devoted to the death of Stonewall Jackson. That said, the rest of the movie was very well shot, especially the battle scenes.I recommend this movie for any Civil War buff, but most casual viewers will be scared off in the beginning. Hey, you can always fast forward to the good stuff!"
3,A little too much fluff,"The story is told somewhat differently than other similar movies and is definitely interesting. Quite a bit of ""overacting"" by several of the actors but still a good flick if you have 3 hours to spare."
4,A sympathetic view of the South,"Contrary to how most Civil War movie portray the South as a confederacy of slave owners and oppressors, this movie focused on the more human side...the Generals who were torn between their duty to their country and their love for their home.Though drawn out in parts, the battle scenes were excellent and the portrayal of Jackson's death...touching!"
2,The Stonewall Jackson Story ?,"Gods and Generals could have been the best civil war film ever made, however the slow script,dreary music(even during action scenes),bad acting and poor camera work fail to stir much emotion. For the sixty million Ted Turner put into this mess, and with GETTYSBURG's Ron Maxwell directing, I was hoping for something alot better. Yes, there are moments when it almost starts to grab you, but it never quite gets there. The only redeeming factor is Stephen Lang's wonderful performance as Jackson. This film would be great if they trimmed everything out except his part and retitled it ""The Stonewall Jackson Story""."
2,Very Dissapointed,"Yes the battle scenes are great and Stephen Lang does a fine performance as Stonewall..but everything else is lousy. Where do i begin: 1) Skipping battles from the 1st Bull Run to Fredericksburg? This was a huge dissapointment. 2) I don't wanna listen to a man sing for 3 minutes when there was so much left out. 3) Yes, the Irish brigade story was very interesting (fighting against fellow irishmen of the Confederacy) but what about alittle development of Hancoock and his division. I feel like he was thrown into this movie and there was no explanation whatsoever of who he was. 4) The Chancelorsville depiction gives no credit to May 3rd when over 23,000 men fell (they only refer to how Stuart triumphed on that day) 5) Robert E. Lee was really a minor part of the movie..i honestly got alittle tired of Stephan Lang talking so much"
2,TOO SLOW!,I usually work out in the mornings and love to watch action / war / epic films to help me get through. I had to turn Gods and Generals off because it was so slow and tedius.
2,"Bad DVD, Boring Movie","I found the movie to be tedious, boring and poorly acted. This wasn't the fault of the vendor, however, but at a bargain price at least the music was outstanding! The DVD delayed several times on the flip side, and I had a hard time getting it to start again where it left off."
1,The Lost Cause lives on...,"How can one possibly describe this 4 hour train wreck of a movie...historically inacurate might be the understatement of the century. It's snail like pace, pathetic dialogue, unapologetic pro-southern stance, and complete refusal to address the deeper issues the war (the only African-American character in the film is a faithful slave) adds up to an absurd piece of pseudo-history...and one not worthy of further comment."
2,LEFTY RESPONDS,"To the viewer in South Carolina. No, I believe a racist term connotates someone's racial make-up. Anyone can be a redneck. It is however, a derogatory term. I guess some rednecks don't be gettin' much schoolin'."
1,HIGHLY OVERRATED,"My comments on this film are: slow, tedious, melodramatic. The battle scenes were very well done - pity the producers didn't just stick to those parts of the movie. When it came to the ""at home"" scenes with wives, family and friends - pure saccharine! Scratch the next two episodes!!"
1,How about No Stars,"Poorly written, historically inept, and boring to boot, this movie focuses mainly upon the career of Stonewall Jackson (an aging, pudgy Joshua Chamberlain is a distraction)and features just about every cliche that the director could fit in about the Lost Cause. The Marble Man, Happy Darkies, God is a Southerner, Southern Rights, Yankee Vandals, the ironies of Irish killing the Irish Brigade, what tripe. Even the battle scenes could not hold my attention. I could easily put this in a worst ten list of movies ever made. The characters are wooden, there is NO historical insight, the actors walk through their roles. Blah."
2,Whatever happened to...???,"I understand that the movie had to be keep within some time limits, but how can you have a movie about the beginning of the Civil War without mentioning a few things. Gen. McClellum and his poor battles; how Lee came to lead the Army of Northern Virginia; and how about Antietam (I think it was kinda important). Do away with some of the lengthy religious dialouges and use this time more wisely."
3,"Too long, true, too talky, true, but worth seeing once...","If, that is, you are a Civil War Buff. ""Gettysburg"" is a much superior film, but ""Gods and Generals"" has gems in it also. Rent it, watch a little at a time, enjoy the fine actors coping with an overloaded script."
3,STEPHEN LANG IS A GREAT ACTOR,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. IT WAS LONG IN SOME PARTS, ESPECIALLY THE BATTLE SCENES. I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR AND THIS MOVIE INSPIRED ME TO LEARN MORE. I LIVE IN MARYLAND, RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO VIRGINIA AND GETTYSBURG. I HAVE NEVER VISITED ANY OF THE BATTLE FIELDS AND MONUMENTS. NOW I WILL.STEPHEN LANG DID AN OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE OF STONEWALL JACKSON. I FELT THAT HE WAS TRUELY ""IN THE MOMENT"" DURING THE FILMING PROCESS. I WAS SURPRISED THAT THIS MOVIE DID NOT RECEIVE ANY NODS FROM THE OSCARS. THERE WERE POSSIBLE BEST ACTOR NODS FOR STEPHEN LANG,EVEN FOR CINAMATOGRAPHY."
3,TOO PREACHY!,"I'm very interested in the Civil War and I really wanted to love this film. However, the obvious, somewhat politically-charged speeches in this film are almost laughable. 200 men, stone-cold silent, listening to the speech of their commander??! Jeff Daniel's Chamberlain was annoying. I know he was a professor fighting in the war, but all his lines were to ""teach"" a lesson. The very little authentic dialogue between the characters resulted in not really even caring about their fates. I felt no emotional connection with the characters, but instead, felt like I had been hit over the head with speech making about war. On the positive side, some of the images of the film are quite moving. Maybe a silent version of the movie would have been better!"
5,Maxwell Captures an Era,"I find this film to be an excellent, detailed, highly accurate portrayal of the spirit of the time in which it took place. People tended to speak in flowery phrases and religious convictions were central to many, if not most, lives. Ron Maxwell and cast deliver the goods when it comes to these issues. I strongly feel that the central irony of the Civil War (there were many) was captured in this film - that people of good will and strong moral certainty, motivated by concepts such as honor, loyalty, courage and devotion to home and family find themselves committing the ultimate sin of murdering one's fellow human beings in the name of those values. Was this film too long? In my opinion, it was not long enough."
1,Dissapointed,"I am a school teacher in Oakland, Ca and ordered this product to share with my students who had just finished reading a selection Re: Food From the Hood. The price of $15.98 seemed a little steep for salad dressing, but I wanted to make a salad for my kids so I went ahead and paid this amount thinking my students would appreciate the realia. It has been over a month and nothing has arrived. I have contacted the company twice and recieved no response. I must say that I am a bit angry at who ever is running this company as they do not seem to feel they have an obligation to either deliver a product or grant a refund.Disgruntled in Oakland,G. Lugo"
3,Carrying case not as pictured.,"Carrying case not as pictured. Pictured is a case with the tools totally enclosed. What arrived is a case that is open on both ends which leaves the wrenches exposed to the elements. See ""Customer Image"" for picture of actual case received.By the way, this EXACT set of tools with open-style case is available at Sears for almost half the price. Don't get burned like I did. I ordered here because I wanted the fully-enclosed style case, which I didn't get."
3,Did not increase range for us,"Bought this and the 5 meter cable, but we did not get any measurable increase in signal strength or range over the stock antenna. Could be just our configuration. The antenna is well made and comes with heavy-duty mounting parts."
2,"Too many errors, mistakes, and oversights.",Other people have said that they like this book. The material chosen is OK ... some of the world's greatest games are here. But the game analysis appears to have been done VERY quickly. There are many mistakes. And the index in the back is so rotten you may as well rip it out and throw it away.
1,Can I give negative stars?,"The Ls in the author's surname should be replaced with Ts to describe the product he spews forth. From the content of this and other of his books, it's evident that he's functionally illiterate, and has only had an able-minded relative explain the 'cut' and 'paste' features of a word processor, which seem to be the only tools used to create this nonsensical tripe. Certainly he was ignorant of the spellcheck feature, and that he was able to convince some nincompoop to publish his intellectual excrement is a defeat of logic ranging into the astronomical in magnitude.In short, don't buy this garbage."
5,Kangaroo Squashy Hat Barmah 1018,"I bought this hat (1018) from a traveling vendor, I have only owned baseball style hats before this one. I love it so much I don't think I'll wear baseball hats that much any more."
1,brim of hat curls,"Disappointed with hat. In all the pictures that brim is flat. Mine on the left side began to curl immediately. Used leather products to try to have it remain flat, but to no avail. The left side in now almost 90 degrees."
3,wrinkle,shipping cost seemed high. my hat arrived with a large permanant wrinkle in the front. i would have sent it back but i had already paid alot for shipping once and couldn't afford to pay more to send it back. otherwise it is a nice hat.
5,Ausi Hat,I love my Barmah Squashy Roo Kangaroo Leather hat...and so do others. I don't have to protect it from getting squashed....amazing. Great hat.
4,great hat,"I ordered this hat for myself, and I love it. the style of it goes almost everywhere. the leather is soft and it stays on my head even in a wind gust. When I get inside I can take the hat off "" squash"" it down to store it and when I go out I take it back out and it comes back to its shape. The only thing I didnt like is the leather has some blemishes."
3,England - 1939-40,Leslie Thomas writes about Great Britain at the start of WWII. The story covers ordinary folk - particularly men forced into the armed services and their daily lives. Good recollections for those 70 and older - maybe a history lesson for younger readers.
1,Serious Judeo-Christian Propaganda,"The book contains some serious Judeo-Christian PROPAGANDA. The author should have known that the Greeks of the old had never heard of Noah. In Greek mythology there is information about three floods (Ogygou, Dardanou and Deufkalyona) instead of one. The Greek Noah was called Deufkalyon and his wife was Pyrra. Athena's veil could not had been Noah's veil because the Greeks simply did not know who Noah was.Zero stars for its content and five stars for the propaganda which the ignorant brain-washed by the (seemingly) biblical propaganda readers will find ""interesting"" and ""amazing"". This book is only worth buying because of the wealth of pictures it contains. Otherwise it is absolutely and purposefully biased, it is absolute CRAP."
4,John th Baptist,"Moo's commentary is good not excellent. I find he tends to chase rabbits. I would have prefered to have read more of his own thoughts on the verses as to so many different opinions of others. Over all he has done a good job, but I would not say his commentary is better than Hodge or Cranfield or some of the other older commentaries on Romans."
5,Excellent Resource,"When studying the book of Romans, an student of the Bible who works with the Original Languages would be remiss to leave this Commentary out of their consultations. Moo displays his competency in both the language and the contemporary ideas surrounding commonly disagreed-upon passages. This commentary used along with Schreiner's work on Romans make a powerful tag-team."
4,"Hot, exotic riffs abound. Check it out.","Robert Stewart is fresh, young and talented. ""The Force"" blends straightforward melodies with intriguing, imaginative evocations of the Middle East."
1,... And they still dont get it.,"To be clear, the 1 star is for the practice of putting out seasons in pieces and not in one set, like they should. Love the show, which is why this annoys me so much.Not sure why Marvel continues to play this game (to be fair DC is doing same with Young Justice). But not going to buy until there is a complete season package. No normal TV show sells like this... can you imagine ABC putting out 4 episodes of Once Upon a Time or w/e and expect people to buy them? Give me a complete season, and I will give you money. Stop jerking us around."
1,Great Series - Terrible DVD Release,"The series in my opinion deserves 5 stars. The reason I gave it only 1 star was to lower the average so people realize how flawed this DVD release is. It has already been stated how the episodes are out of order. Totally annoying unless you don't mind switching discs back and forth to view them in proper order. Otherwise the episodes don't make sense, and the previously on... at the beginning of each episode is a spoiler for upcoming episodes that should have come earlier. Also, you will need to print out the episode list from the internet just to know the proper sequence. It is just totally screwed up and shows the disregard Disney execs have for their customers. Thankfully I previewed this DVD from the library because I won't be adding it to my collection."
3,"I like the season, only wish they had the entire series out on dvd","I love The Avengers, and hated too see the show taken off the air, when there are so many stories too tell. While I like the dvd, some of the episodes were out of sequence, compared too when they were on Disney XD, and the bonus episode of ""Powerless,"" on disc two, never aired. One episode mentioned in the set, ""Along came a Spider,"" wasn't encluded in the set. Hopefully they will put the remaining episodes on dvd soon. In time for Christmas. My son loves The Avengers. Especially The Hulk and Iron Man. Me, I liked The Red Hulk. And would of loved too of seen Betty Ross has the Red She-Hulk on the series. She wears less then the Green She Hulk, maybe that's why I like her. lol"
4,Don't let the the one star reviews deter you.,"Great show, flawed dvd release. There are some complaints about the episodes being out of order. I think they should have done a recall on this set and fixed it but that's unlikely to happen. So just be sure and watch the Vision episode last and you should be fine. A couple other eps are out of order but they are stand alone stories so its not as big of a deal."
1,It sucked big time,"They did'nt add any of the good episodes, just the bullshit ones. I wanted to see the Winter soilder episode, or the New Avengers episode none of that just the bullshit ones. A big let down ."
5,Stunning Young-Adult British Fantasy Great for Adults,"EARTHFASTS is, despite all the horror novels out there, the most truly and subtly terrifying book I have ever read.Two modern British boys are caught up in a growing wave of ancient magic in the English countryside. Standing stones walk; strange things are heard in the earth and air; a pale-flamed candle gives them disturbing visions that draw them further from the world they know.In the caves beneath, a King sleeps until his people need him again. But a curious drummer-boy, from the garrison of a castle long since in ruins, has disturbed the King's rest too soon. Can our heroes set the world right before it is destroyed?One thing I really liked about this book is that the risen magics are never fully explained and named. Instead of a pat answer to everything, we have archetypal patterns and echoes, mysteries and hidden things. Fear and wonder, not simple explanations, are the core of this fantastic book."
2,Unable to provide useful review,"This product is designed to provide a warning signal to neighbors about too cold conditions in a temporarily unoccupied dwelling. I ran a test outside during a cold evening to see that the device turned on and off at near a set temperature (about 40 degrees F, in my test). It did, turning on a light. The real test will be over the winter, when it, hopefully, will not come on at all. Next spring, I may be able to provide a better review, at least about it not coming on and me not having frozen pipes."
1,Honeywell Winter Watchman,"Not even cold yet and this item has malfunctioned twice....set 10 degrees lower than the thermostat, it's set off the warning light twice to have the neighbors checking it out........NOT a good purchase, but a good idea. Something better than this is needed, don't waste your $."
1,Honeywell Freeze Alarm--Winter Watchman,"I should have listened to some other reviews about false alarms,but trusted the name Honeywell.I had this set to 40 degrees and was notified by a neighbor that the light went on.After going to the home where the alarm was, I found that my whole home(2 zone heat) was 52 degrees,just like I set the thermostats.I can no longer trust this product(a recent purchase) and would not recommend it."
1,Don't Buy,"Installed by our Plumbing and Heating Specialist. It did not work right out of the box. Set the Watchman at 45 degrees and it came on when the acutal temperature was above 50 degrees. Reset it for 40 degrees, and it still gave a false alarm. It has been returned. We will try a wireless therometer next (supposedly good for over 300 feet)."
5,Great product for seasonal resident,We leave NY for FL for several months and this allows us to lower our heat temperature lower then we would normally in the winter. We attached a strobe light to this which will go off and flash in the window towards our neighbors to alert them if the heat goes below a certain temp.
3,"Watchman failed within the first 30 days, I purchased 2 more if another one fails.","If I have another failure I will send then back for a refund. I am 1000 miles from my home, neighbor is watching my home. not happy that they had to go and check my home when unit started to send false signals."
1,Unreliable,"I have owned this device for a few years to monitor low temperature in my vacation home. I set it up to turn on a red light in a window visible to a helpful neighbor. I set the device to turn on the light when it monitored 40F degrees temperature, ten degrees below the temperature set on the house furnace thermostat. Initially it seemed to work. Later it began turning on the light regardless of the room temperature. I moved the device several times to no avail thinking it was influenced by a draft off the window or was too low to the floor. Then, I conducted one more overnight test. I located it immediately adjacent to the room thermostat which was set at 50F and set the Winter Watchman at 40F. In the morning the house thermostat read 50F and the WW had turned on the warning light creating a false alarm. I've given up on it and the annoyance it has created for a friendly neighbor."
3,I Ordered the Wrong Item,I did not read through the description of this item and when it arrived I realized that it wasn't what I was looking for. The seller was very understanding and refunded my purchase price.
2,works but....,"Temp setting seems useless. No mateer what temp we set the light was on. We keep heat at 50 and set at 45, light on, set at 40 light on, set at lowest temp light off. We cannot trust it so we bought a different solution."
1,Useless device never worked,For a simple device how can Honeywell build such a piece of junk. Never worked right from the box. The least Honeywell could do is test them in the factory before shipping. I Give the company an F grade for sheer stupidity for lousy workmanship and no quality control and allowing this junk to be built with their name on it.
5,Working well,"Being used in a garage with fire truck, and so far temperature setting is working well, and no false alarms. When we see the light on in the station, we know we have a problem with heat."
1,Not reliable,"Unstable and Unreliable. Really cheap. Honeywell could do better, particularly on a thermostat. Doesn't work most of the time."
1,Very unreliable,"Honeywell can do much better. For a company that works with all kinds of industrial and retail controls you would think they could create a simple, inexpensive device to turn a light on and off within a few degrees. I purchased two of them, against the better judgement of the other reviewers, and they were right. I tested them with my very accurate dial thermometer in my home freezer. They are not consistent individually or together. They turn on randomly over a temperature range of 6 to 10 degrees. I would not trust either of them to warn of a freeze. Honeywell should be ashamed to sell such an unreliable control."
3,Not for the faint of heart,A little too aggressive as the shallowest arch is still pretty extreme for someone with a naturally stiff back. Maybe over time I will adapt
2,Lumbar Extender,"This product looks like the perfect solution for back pain, however neither myself or my husband is able to assemble it. Apparently one must be a superman in order to get the heavy plastic to bend. Sadly, I must return it.Lumbar Extender"
3,not as good as apple,I ordered these after I had bought the apple ones which I like a lot. These tend not to be as moist. They aren't bad toasted but am a little disappointed with the dryness. Haven't tried microwaving one yet to see if some moisture can be restored but am not counting on it.
5,Delicious!,My kids (one is 7 and the other is 10) eat these bars everyday for breakfast. We are on an auto ship for these bars and I think it is a fantastic price for the case. I personally have not tasted them as I am a celiac but my kids have tried every organic bar out there in every flavor and keep coming back to this brand and flavor.They are not big breakfast eaters but this bar seems to do the trick with a little cereal/oatmeal in the winter.
4,Simple yet elegant!,This is a simple but yet elegant pen set. If you are looking for something subtle then this would be your set.
5,Great Book !!!,"Like most of his books about the military, Tom Clancy presents military subjects in a way that most people, especially those that don't come from a military background, would understand and at the same time don't insult the readers intelligence by dumbing it down. This book is no exception since he writes in the same way as his other books."
3,Could have been much better,"Clancy offers just enough to information to let you know that there is quite a story to be told of the Airborne and its soldiers. The problem is that he doesn't tell it. While equipment is important, Clancy is so enamored by it that it dwarfs any emphasis of the people and what they do. The book isn't a snooze-fest, but it also isn't riveting. Without a doubt, the worst part of the book is the small photographs. They are numerous and useless. Most of the time they add absolutely no information. They are maybe 2 inches by 2 inches and taken from very far away so that often all that can be seen is specks."
3,"Who really makes the airborne ""airborne"" ? The Riggers!","Read the book and nothing went into depth about the Parachute Riggers. Its not a pleasnt thought that that one would have if they realize that every parachute you pack your name goes into the log record. With out the Parachute Rigger their would be no ""Airborne"" to write about! Do Me a Favor Tom, next time you write about a subject give the men who actually deal with the Parachutes a little credit too."
5,My companion,"You know, every now and then, something occurs that really gets the mind thinking. These generaly raise questions that range from little ""Huh, I wonder why..."" to the massive ""Why, in the name of all that is good and pure don't we..."" Well, this is one of those books. And I know you probably don't want to have to sit and read a super-long essey of a review, so I'll cut to the chase: Why, in the name of all that is good and pure, hasn't one of our presidents picked Tom Clancy as their National Security Advisor>"
2,What's the matter with this guy?,"First of all, the most distinguishing characteristic of all airborne troops is the Airborne ""All the Way"" attitude. Clancy devotes only one sentence to this unique airborne trait. Instead, he focuses on the equipment and toys instead of the men. Clancy has never been in the service--he would've known that hi-tech weaponry are just tools. The most dangerous weapon is the individual soldier with the desire to win. Someone tell this to Clancy. And what's with this endless comparison of the 82d to the USMC? The 82d will run circles around the Corps."
2,Beat Club..ARRRggh,"I shudder when I think of Beat Club performances. All except maybe a very few, were mimed and just featured tracks lifted from albums with some overdubs to make them sound ""live"". So if you want to see T Rex on a small stage miming to album tracks, then go ahead. Otherwise get Bolan on video elsewhere and buy Spaceball to hear solo acoustic Bolan."
4,Bolan Magic,"With few T. Rex DVD's available, this ""Enhanced CD"" with cd Rom capabilities is a great edition. It gives Bolan fans an opportunity to see T.Rex as well as hear them Live. Though the material was taped for German TV in the early 70's, and isn't of todays quality and contains some overdubs, it's great to see & hear, especially Buick MacKane. I've seen hundreds of the top rock bands & musicians live, but the magic of T. Rex was something special. Gone, but not forgotten."
2,"Too much punk, not enough steam","I found myself disliking this comic, which is unfortunate because it was highly recommended by others as, well, 'steampunk'. I like steampunk, but I really don't like this.This is like steampunk written by Gwar, but not nearly as tongue-in-cheek. Drama and style abound, but I cannot agree that the plot is complex. It was very disappointing.The art and layout is highly detailed, highly colorful/inky, and reminds me quite a lot of World of Warcraft or MageKnight (miniatures). Character design is over-the-top. Unfortunately I felt like the whole thing was trying too hard to be different without first developing substance.To be honest, by the midway point I was just hoping for:A) An explanation without all the expositionB) The death of most of the charactersThe only positive thing I can say is that it is dripping with its own unique style, and I respect that artistic effort enough not to give it one star."
5,A great introduction to heavy-duty truck systems,"We used this book in our diesel technician class. The book gives you an excellent introduction to every aspect of a heavy-duty truck. I usually shy away from books written by more than one author because of lack of continuity or overcoverage in certain areas. In the case of this book, the authors have done a fantasic job of explaining the topics without any assumptions. The book does a good job in covering cluthes, standard transmission, torque converters, drive shafts, axles, and automatic transmissions. On the subject of brakes, I recommend Delmar's ""Today's Technician: Medium/Heavy Duty Truck Brakes."" If your thinking of buying a book on this subject matter, you can't go wrong with this selection. Be aware that a third edition has been released."
1,GARBAGE TRIPE,THIS BPOOK IS A TOTAL JOKE TO ANYONE WHO IS EMPLOYED IN THE TRUCKING FIELD THIS GUY MUST BE ON BENNIES OR HE NEEDS TO GET LAID BY BIG TRUCK STOP BEATTY. ANOTHER JOKER OVER CHARGING FOR KNOWLEDGE THAT HE REALLY DOES NOT POSSES. TYPICAL YANK CRACKER.
4,heavy duty truck systems,"this the 1st time me using this site so i don't have much to say, but i like what i need.i think its nice book for who just start how to work in shop or people who like to work with truck"
3,When is the DVD coming???,"Really would like to see this in DVD, our VHS died and we're not replacing it..."
4,Great Christmas CD with Soul,"Enjoyable Christmas CD, with pattent Hall and Oats soul added. Best cut, their classic version of Jingle Bell Rock."
4,A New Country Classic,"The new song written by Daryl Hall ""Home For Christmas"" will be a favorite of anyone who has fond memories of family gatherings at Christmas. It became a favorite of mine the first time I heard it, and I had to have the CD."
2,Over rated,"Based on the reviews and that it had Jingle Bell Rock I ordered this CD. By the time it got to No Child Should ever Cry at Christmas, I was crying over the $5 I spent. I stuck through it because Jingle Bell Rock was coming up. This is not the same version that you hear on the radio. The one on the radio is my favorite version, the one on the CD is lame and is not as good. Don't waste your money on this CD."
1,Cd stuck,Mine got stuck in my CD player and now I can't listen to my favorite songs and I can't use my CD player.
5,Hall&Oates Christmas CD,I love this cd. The vocals are great and the music is just right for the Season. H&O are a favorite duo and this cd is too.
5,Wonderful!,"This collection is truly wonderful. The songs are well chosen, not the same old songs you always hear. And their versions of O Holy Night and It Came Upon a Midnight Clear are rich, soulful and the best I have ever heard."
4,I look forward to December so I can listen to this!,"This is such a fun CD. I LOVE ""Christmas Must Be Tonight"", Daryl & John's version of The Band's song. ""Children Go Where I Send Thee"" is very inspirational! They are really in their element when singing ""Everyday Will Be Like a Holiday."" Their versions of standards and sacred Christmas songs are great in their own way, too. This is definitely a worthwhile album for your holiday collection!"
4,Works great! Except....,"This harness, for our slightly larger than usual Rat Terrier, has worked out great with the exception of it rubbing on the backs of his armpits. There doesn't seem to be any redness or chaffing, but his coat is pretty thinned out there compared to before. He doesn't seem to mind at all though, and I think him and I are willing to accept that small detail to avoid neck and throat injuries caused by normal collars. I no longer feel guilty about yanking at his neck when he tries to chase a squirrel, and I feel safe that he can't slip out of it as well. Recommended!"
4,Great Purchase,"Worked great for my larger (30lb) Shiba Inu that pulls. Definitely read how to fit to your dog to prevent any discomfort to your pet and to make sure the harness works correctly. It was shipped to me in a very expedient manner, as well. I would recommend to any pulling-dog owner!"
5,A woman of Honor,Dr Mary E Walker is a very rare lady. She believed in equal rights for women and wrote many papers and gave many speeches on this subject.
3,Review of a great help book,"This is an excellent window to be aware of the importance of integrating purchasing strategies with various business tools such as TQM, JIT, MRP.The author critically analyses trends of management focus and gives suggestions to purchasing personnel to re-allign and improve their performance measures of cost, quality and delivery. As a practising purchase manager, I have been greatly benefited in provoking the thought process of my department personnel to constantly innovate and improve their effectiveness. I have recomended a copy of this book to all libraries of our 17 group companies. I would be delighted if the author and the publishers come out with material on using ""change management"" by purchase professionals to use tools of ERP and e-commerce and ""adjust their sails"" to ride the new cutting edge technologies."

2,What Happened?,"I have a burned cd with demos from well before this CD came out. I bought it expecting things to have improved, and for the additional songs to be just as good. Unfortunatly, if I feel like hearing these guys play with any level of decency, I have to listen to my demo disk. The new tracks are [...], the old ones don't sound as good, and this thing doesn't even have ""A Slow Decent"" on it, which is probably the best song they have anyway. Just try to find the old stuff."
4,Not what I expected...,"Wow!!! Totally not what I expected.. I actually give this 4.5 stars. I bought this cd on a whim, never actually hearing anything from Straylight Run before. It paid off. If you are a fan of early Ben Folds Five you will probably love this cd. Definately worth a listen if you want a semi-mellow sound."
2,What happened?,Let's get one thing straight. This new version of taking back sunday is horrible. That is the only thing everyone needs to know. Losing John Nolan has helped this band regress very successfully. They sound like a some sort of new age garage band. Don't waste your money buying this cd. Listen to their old cd's and pray to god that the old band members find it in their hearts to give this new taking back sunday band some help in the future. What is the world coming too.
1,"Horrible, just horrible.",This album is great as a cure for insomnia. Pretentious lyrics (many of the reviewers on this site mistake pseudo-intellectualism for actual thoughtfulness) and boring music make for one bad record.
4,positives of TBS split,"After the original line up of Taking Back Sudnay parted ways I was skeptical. It turns out the new TBS album is better than the first (in my opinion) and now we have STRAYLIGHT RUN. John Nolan shows vocal ability that was not shown on ""Tell all your friends"" where he was primarily Adam Lazzara's backup screamer. He really has a nice voice and blend's well with his sister who also sings's voice. The music is beautiful....mellow piano, some faster tracks....just a really nice CD. So different from what I would have expected in a completely great way. Not to mention live they blew me away.Best songs: Existentialism on Prom Night, Your name Here (Sunrise Highway), Its for the best, Another Word For Desperate"
2,Only two good songs,The only songs I like are Existintialism on Prom Night and The Tension and the Terror. The rest are boring.
4,Beautiful Album,"This CD is amazing. I was a bit skeptical before I bought it because i hadn't heard much from them but trust me, this is probably one of my best cd's and i have a pretty nice collection. The only song i don't really like is #8, pretty much only because it's kinda techo-ish. i'm not a big techno guy but overall this cd is a GREAT buy!"
4,Emo much?,"Piano, sad, lonely, desperate, perfect are just some key words pertaining to EMO, fortunately Straylight run incorporates these words whether it be in there music or the titles of songs. I never heard taking back sunday...yes i'm telling the truth I never listened to taking back sunday. Does that make me stubborn? I just got done listening to this cd in its entirety. The piano complimented by his calm,deep,yet screamo voice solidify the effort and emotion put into this album. The lyrics aren't anything compared to the singer/songwriters over at Saddlecreek records, however this is an excellent cd for relaxation purposes or perhaps to clear your mind of things that happened to you ""today""."
5,Running's pretty cool.,"Yea, they're soft. Really good and depressing. I like to listen to these guys and one girl when things in life seem messed up. They've got talent as in vocals, and drums are impressive. Guitars are scarce in this album, but keyboard too is relaxing. The best songs are #3 and #9. If You like softer emo, they're great. If you don't like 10 songs that are make-you-cry, then don't buy it. I like them. Pick them up."
5,Vivaldi at its best,"The opera contains some of the best music written by Vivaldi, who was an opera composer as much as an instrumental music one. Wonderful arias, in various styles. There is some sensational singing by Cecilia Gasdia, for example, the aria Se mai senti, in which she mimicks, with soft and long notes, the breeze that carries the laments of a lover to his beloved."
4,A predictable but enjoyable story,The main characters grab you from the moment they are introduced and the story just flows like the river after that! Although the directions each character takes is predictable; the story unfolds so smoothly that I had a hard time putting the book down! Georgina Gentry is one of the best writers of historical romance!
5,The title says it all...,"This is by far the best study guide I found for the Praxis II PLT middle grades 5-9. The only complaint about the book is that the two practice tests are outdated with the Praxis PLT format change in September of last year (now more essay questions and fewer multiple choice), but the information that you need to know is still the same. The book helped me pass on the first try.Buy this book."
2,Perhaps this book needs an update,"Having thoroughly studied this book, I was surprised to find that the actual test was rather different. There were questions on legislation and assessment statistics that were not covered in the book. Also, this book stressed that grammar and writing ability were important in the constructed answer questions, but on the test you could use list, outline, prose - whatever form you wanted to get the information down."
4,Wish they wouldn't have changed,"These bars are great but recently they changed packagaing and style, I get why less waste, better for the environment, etc. But unfortunately for me, my autistic son recognized that they changed the packagaing and refuses to eat them now. He used to love them and I also noticed the bar is more compact now and texture is different. I still think they are good but unfortunately I will have to take them off my auto delivery service since they were purchased for my son. The Bars were already delicious I just wish they wouldn't have changed them. But I do recommend these they are delicious."
4,EnviroKids Berry Bars are a livesaver,"Both of my children are gluten free and we are always looking for easy and delicious snacks to get us through the day. I am a big fan of EnviroKids products, including the Crispy Rice Berry Bars. They are soft and chewy, with little bits of fruit. My kids eat these up and I feel okay with them eating these on an almost daily basis because they have so many natural ingredients. The only drawback is that they can get messy-- my two-year-old especially tends to hold on to them too long and the rice cereal starts to come apart and get stuck in the carpet, clothes, etc. Still a great gluten free product!"
2,high sugar snack,"These taste good, but are a bit too sweet. The sweetness level reminds me of Rice Krispie treats. Keep in mind they have 7 g of sugar and just 1 g of protein. There really isn't much nutrition in these bars... 110 virtually empty calories."
1,Disappointed...,"I also had ordered these bars and had my ordered cancelled. They had the money pending out of my bank account, and had sent an e-mail stating that this item was on back order and should ship within 7-10 days. Then, a couple days later, they decided they had listed the wrong price so they cancelled their orders. They should not have sent out an e-mail stating they were backordering when that was a lie (they obviously have no problem today having it in stock). I will not order from this company again..."
1,No trust,"I oredered when the price was 4.99. But they cancelled my order without reason and any explanation.The price was 4.99 few days ago and Now They changed for 18.46.First e-mail ""They were back ordered""...and Second e-mail ""they will ship one month later""and finally they e-mail me that""your order has been canceled. Your credit card was not charged for this order. If you're still interested in this item, please search for it again on Amazon.com.""Obviously, They have stocks(They sell).... And what is the reason? No trust!"
1,order was cancelled,I ordered these bars and was sent info from vitaminshoppe that they were backordered and would be sent out later than originally posted. I later received an email from Amazon that my order was cancelled yet the item shows it in stock. I believe that the item was posted at a too low price and Amazon or Vitamin shoppe couldn't keep up with the volume of orders. Very disappointed.
4,Solid GF and organic product,"Pretty good and fulfilling. It's a good choice for road trips. Its nice for those of us that eat organic and gluten free which makes it hard to find something to eat on the road, these fill the need."
4,Fantastic Snack!,"I've been buying these bars at Whole Foods for a while now, they are fantastic! I usually buy the peanut butter ones, which are good but not quite as flavorful as the berry bars. I love the fact that there are actual freeze-dried raspberries and blueberries in the bar, it gives them a subtle kick. I can't tolerate large amounts of gluten, so these are perfect for a snack. The size of the bars is nice, but they are not very filling so they can be addicting...But it's better than eating a regular cereal bar, many bars these days have artificial sugars and all kinds of scary things in them. At least with these bars, I can pronounce everything listed in the ingredients!Love 'em!"
5,Fast snack or breakfast,"This is an old standby for our gluten free diet and trips. It travels well (although it can get smashed-but still tastes fine). It would be good for camping as it is light. My kids like all the flavors. Would be good for backpacks, school trips, etc."
1,what a joke,This was just too small. Should have figured out what a 50 mm sphere was before it was ordered.
4,Praise the Warlord!!,"Heavy, doomy early 70's metal similar to Sabbath, Atomic Rooster and Black Widow. Studio material rocks live stuff doesn't.If you like your metal dark you may like this."
1,Wrong release,"This is a totally wrong release (re-issue) trying to cash in on iconoclastic hard rock/proto-doom British outfit, using the original artwork of legitimate compilation featuring:1. Jasmin Queen2. Explorer3.Face of The Sun4. Warlord5. Lady Killer6. To The Devil A Daughter7. Devil Drunk8. Wild Africa9. I See The Warlord10. Face Of The Sun11. Ring12. Warlord (Reprise)The genuine Warlord was a short-lived brainchild of exceptional organist Ivan Coutts, which emerged from Blacksmiths. Now, that one is a must for everybody about HMR and doom"
2,"Where's the ""Sabbath-style"" doom?","Contrary to the info given by the label, there's absolutely no Sabbath influence or ""doom metal"" (or any metal for that matter) whatsoever on this disc. It's a fairly entertaining 70's organ-driven rock album, and I probably would have enjoyed it more if the label was upfront with their description of the music."
1,Pilgrim wanders a little too far to the middle.,"If it was Clapton's intention to complete the crossover to 'lite' rock/pop, consider this CD is a smashing success. It took only the 1st 3 or 4 songs and a glance at the credits to see where this CD was heading. I did however hold on to some hope for a gut wrenching version of the great blues number Going Down Slow. Boy, was I in for a surprise. Some disks take several listens to fully appreciate. I'm afraid this is one disk I won't be giving a second chance. What could have been a powerful CD, has been lost to 'technopop'. Sorry Eric, you're a proven and wonderful artist - but you've lost me on this one."
1,what happened to Slowhand??,"This CD totally lacks what Eric Clapton is really about. He worked in England over the past couple of years doing Techno stuff with some English bands. As we can tell, it influenced him on this record... But where is Eric Clapton the bluesmaster?? This record may have been another direction for him and he may have liked it, but I personally take no pleasure in listening to this album. ""Sick and Tired"" is the only reason for the one star."
1,This is not your father's Clapton album,"I anxiously awaited yet another album from Eric Clapton, and bought it the first day it was available. Instead of hearing yet another great performance, I heard a stunning letdown. This album has Babyface's fingerprints all over it. Eric's guitar is all but gone, and his voice whines like a pimple-faced teenager without a date. If you expect the Clapton you know, this album is a disappointing stranger."
2,A Letdown,"Eric Clapton is probably the best guitarist ever. This CD is certainly not one of his best. I am a big fan of Clapton, but this was a letdown. The only real strong song on this is My Father's Eyes."
2,I must be getting old...,"This album received a lot of good reviews, but I hear it as fluff designed to sound comtempory and sell records. ""My Father's Eyes"" was a good single, but on this album Clapton not only loses his musical roots, but brings to mind a quote from a long-ago Clapton song, ""Bet you didn't think I knew how to rock and roll."" After listening to this album, I'll take that bet."
4,an average album from a master,"EC isn't perfect(who is?) Still, this album was one of the best released in 1998. IMHO, ""One Chance"" is one of EC's finest, having his signature, and being innovative at the same time."
1,It went in the trash,"I have most of EC's recordings and love most of them and really like the rest. However, I bought this abomination the day it was released, naturally figuring I'd at least greatly enjoy it. I played it through once, took it out of my CD player and threw it in the garbage, because that is what this is...garbage. The electronic drum tracks ruined it the most, but it honestly doesn't even sound like Eric Clapton, more like some R&B guy trying to sound like him. Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere."
1,Unimpressed,"I play Unplugged again and again, and never tire of it. I played Pilgrim once, and was so disappointed. Mechanical drum beats, strings in the background, no audience showing appreciation and inspiring the performer.Come on, Eric, this is not the way the old blues men played."
1,What happened to old slowhand?,"I always admire artists who try to break new ground while holding on to their roots. A great example is EC's brilliant work on the soundtrack for the movie Rush. But on Pilgrim? When I listen to this album (75 minutes, no less!), I expect a disc jockey in a smooth, low voice to announce between songs, ""Music for your work day, on LITE-FM."" What's next-a connection to lonely teens by playing full-force heavy metal?"
3,Good music for relaxation and meditation,"Eric Clapton has come up with some deep lyrics on ""Pilgrim"", and some intense music to go along with them. However, many of the songs are too long and drawn-out for my taste. I found it difficult to get into this album by just sitting and listening to it, but having it play in the background while I'm doing something else adds a definite atmosphere to the room. Fans of Eric Clapton will enjoy ""Pilgrim"", but the younger crowd who have just stumbled upon his work might be better suited exploring some of his earlier albums."
1,Utterly worthless,This Clapton CD is totally un-listenable. What a bunch of lightweight pap from the most respected guitar player of a generation. Keep it up Eric and you'll be the next McCartney - a non-seller!
2,"Eric, What were you thinking?","There are artists whose CDs I buy whether I have heard them or not. Bruce, Carlos, SRV, and up until now Clapton. From this CD on I listen before I buy. How can a guy who has brought us such great music stub his toe so bad every now and then?it doesn't diminish Eric's talent but it certainly does makes us question his judgement."
2,This Is So Bad,"I'm the most advid Eric Clapton fan on the planet but, this cd is so bad. He better stop working with no talents like babyface, because that could be his demise. He should work with new up and coming talent like Johnny Lang & Kenny Wayne Shepard. But don't buy this cd buy an older one of Clapton's"
5,A Landmark Album,"Put on your sunglasses, grab a lawn chair, kick back and listen to this album. That's how cool it is, full of tremendous song writing, nice bass lines and simple melodies. Clapton keeps himself under control and sets a tone of high emotion as a Miles Davis-like minimalist. Not only has Clapton mastered his technique, but he has pushed the limits, combining dance/r&b rhythm with a clear and consistent voice. This is clearly an inflection point for Clapton, a landmark album that should be recognized."
2,"EC has done better stuff, to be honest...","Eric Clapton is, and has been, a staple on my music rack for many years. I've enjoyed the various phases that his music has gone through, until now. There is no doubt -- ""Pilgrim"" is filled with great guitar work (EC fans expect no less). Unfortunately, EVERY track is filled with a drum machine beat, making each song sound similar to the previous one. The first time I listened to the album, it was as though there were only 2-3 songs, repeated endlessly.Just before ""Pilgrim"" was made, EC did an album (of electronica, I think) in another joint venture with Simon Climie. I think a lot of that carried over onto ""Pilgrim,"" and it's a shame.All in all, you really don't need this album unless you're a ""completist"" and simply must own every EC recording."
1,"Man, this Sucks.","This music is banal, uninspired, boring, monotonous and just sucks the soul out of the living. The final cut, Inside of Me, contains an almost subliminal message of the most trite kind. All things considered, if Utopia is closer to us than anyone can imagine, then it sucks. If this is applied science and centralization, then Clapton has become a zombie going through the motions. This album should be blown to smithereens."
4,"Eric Claptons' "" Pilgrim""","purchased Eric Claptons' Pilgrim"" CD and it lived up to the promo on Amazon.It is combination of fresh takes on some of my favorits and some mew great songs Clapton is KING"
3,River of tears,"This album is a definite departure from anything Clapton has done before. It's modern, R&B, and extremely produced. Overall, I have to say that the song quality is uneven, ranging from kind of saccharine(""My father's Eyes"") to brilliant(""River of Tears"" and ""Broken Hearted""). ""River of Tears"" is one of the saddest songs that I have ever heard. Of course, blues covers are his specialty, and he shines on songs like ""Goin' Down Slow."" Two major criticisms of this album. The first is that it is overly produced. Eric sounds best when there's a little more grit in the production. Secondly, it has elements of that Babyface sounding R&B. It doesn't quite work."
4,Eric meets Curtis,"Roger Waters of Pink once said: ""The only important think about a finished product is whether it moves you or not"". Pilgrim moved me. For me it's the ""Eric meets Curtis"" album, featuring his most soulful playing and singing ever. His guitar sounds sweet and milky like never before. If this is not the Clapton you want - no problem. He's done Crossroads and Layla before."
2,Listen to this album before you buy it!,"I got this album at a used music store, which meant it was cheap, but also meant I couldnt bring it back for a refund. The song ""Father's Eyes"" is great. I love it and it almost justifies this album. I understand Clapton did this shortly after the loss of his young son, and that accounts for the tone of the album. In fact, the lyrics are exceptional, but this amounts to a $5,000 paint job on a burning Pinto. There is one other song on this album I liked, the title track, and that is it. Two good songs, two stars, that seems more than fair. From the reviews it is clear this album grows on some people, but hey, so does fungus if you're not careful. Buy this with eyes open. Maybe you will grow to like it, maybe you won't. In a month of listening I still hear a dozen tracks out of 14 that bore me silly. I honestly think it was mostly catharsis for Clapton, and most fans, including me, just arent going to dig it."
3,Nice piece of work,"Out of all the music from Clapton, this has to be the best that has come out of him. The songs are pretty much on the softer side with a nice beat to them.I never have liked Eric Clapton, but this cd really got to me."
2,"This must be the ""new"" Eric Clapton.","This album is unlike any of his older albums. If you like the blues influence in Eric Clapton's music, you will be disappointed. There is none. The songs are more techno, pop, barely-rock numbers, which you would expect to hear on stations that typically serve up Celine Dion and Michael Bolton. Clapton's duet with Baby Face bothered me. This stuff has me rattled. My recommendation: Skip it, unless you want to ""complete"" your Clapton collection."
4,"A good, if newer, Eric Clapton sound","This is a great Clapton CD for the younger listeners to get used to him before going to such things as Cream. You can tell it's Eric, but the drum machine gets a little tireing before the end. The more I listen to it, however, the more I like it. Great going, Eric!"
4,"A nice mix, showing Clapton's diversity and versatility.","Pilgrim is not your typical Clapton. In fact, I found it a bit soft and uninvolved when I first heard it. However, upon significant additional plays, I can highly recommend this CD. The lyrics are strong and the music complex and creative."
2,Clapton should stick to what he knows best,"I am a long-time fan of Eric Clapton. I can appreciate all of the changes he and his career have gone through. However, this is the first Eric Clapton album I have purchased and actually considered returning. Like many other artists, Clapton has apparently chosen to try and do something that sells records rather than make something that lives up to his legendary status. Like Bonnie Raitt or Joe Cocker, Clapton is at his legendary best when he sings and plays from his gut. Raitt gave up the blues and went with the slick sound on 'Nick of Time' and Cocker seems to go back and forth on virtually every album. One song great Cocker, the next a slick disappointment. Do you honestly think 'Pilgrim' will go down in history like 'Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs' or even 'Journeyman'? If this is the road Clapton has chosen, then I wish him the best of luck, but I won't be buying any more of his albums."
1,worse than 1 star,"This is the worst album from eric crapton.I didn`t think eric could go bee-gees on us but he did.This is some disco danny stuff.I`m surprised eric isn`t wearing his polyester pants on the cover of this lemmon.Next eric will cover,how deep is your love or night fever.Disco down eric!"
5,Many people will say this album sucks...but,"It is a bit different than his usual sound in that it is more polished and it has a lusher overall soundscape and does not just depend on the guitar to drive it. This doesn't make the album bad by any stretch of the imagination. If you want guitar and nothing but, this might not be for you, but if you can enjoy the depth of the sound and the overall scoundscape of the arrangements, this album is very beautifully crafted. Personally it is one of my favorite Clapton albums, I own most of them. I don't mind that this is different, artists with careers as long as Clapton need to experiment and try different things, in this case it works very well and I don't understand the hatred and ire this album induces among fans. It might not be typical, but who wants to by the same thing over and over?"
3,too many vocals,I was hoping for more guitar only cuts. Clapton's voice is OK but it is his guitar playing that appeals to me.
4,This album displays the tremendous diversity of Clapton.,"I love listening to this album and never tire of it. It is one of very few albums in which I catch myself enjoying every song, though each one is different from the rest. ""She's gone"" is rougher and biting; a touch of Flamenco in ""Circus,"" and the final track is one that makes me think. Clapton was ROBBED when he did not get the album Grammy on this one."
2,Clapton Sells Out,"Every time i think back to the days of Cream, I cant imagine what he was thinking when producing this album......I had no idea Clapton was such a R&B fan. Although this is a good r&b disc, it would've been better if he'd stuck to his roots. Yeah, I know all great musicians evolve (Hendrix--from physcdelic to funk), but i think this album was an overkill. Last, my favorite song is ""Born in Time"", a Bob Dylan-written song."
3,This collection is a milepost in Clapton's career.,"For years I have listened to, and been disappointed by, what seemed to be Eric Clapton's seeming habit of ripping off others with his covers (Johnny and the Hand Jive, I Shot the Sheriff, After Midnight, among many others), and of writing maudlin mass-market tunes as at home on the CD player as in the elevator or dentist's office. Everything he did was serviceable, passable: 30 minutes after hearing a Clapton tune, you wanted to hear ""real music."" Pilgrim has changed my attitude. I thought of Clapton as a bluesician; the simple truth is, he isn't. He can play the blues, no doubt about it. He can also play funk, techno, tin-pan-alley. He plays, all in one place on Pilgrim, what appeals to himself. In the final analysis, Clapton has a place on my shelf. When I want blues, I'll go to Joe Louis Walker, and when I want roadhouse to JJ Cale. But when I just want what I can listen to without working at it, I'll go back to Pilgrim."
1,Leaves Long Time Fan Stone Cold,"I have virtually everything EC has ever recorded & have seen him in concert many times over the past twenty something years. The only reason I listened to this CD more than once was to make sure I wasn't missing something. I don't expect him to repeat the same guitar solos, styles & formats of his past work, but this piece is devoid of any of the reasons I have always been one of his biggest fans.Also, the fact that so many reviewers here can give a five star rating to a Clapton CD with so many drum machines permeating every track confirms my belief that there are at least two very different sets of Eric Clapton fans. I don't think Eric himself would have been inspired by this CD had he heard it in his earlier years from another artist."
1,don't!,"i wish i had heeded the one star review that warned me against this cd. i got on an eric clapton kick after reading his biography, and got carried away. you might as well have a disco ball spinning while you listen to this one. the loud tinny electronic back beat drives me crazy. what an amateurish endeavor; not worthy of this great blues guitarist."
3,Something different,"I'm amazed at the vitriol of some of these reviews. The album ought to be judged on its own merits. It doesn't make any sense to rate it 1-star because it's a different style of music than you were expecting. If it's not your prefered genre that's your problem, it doesn't automatically make the music ""awful."" Yeah, it's a departure. And it's also a passionate and lovely album. ""My Father's Eyes"", ""River of Tears"", ""Pilgrim"", and ""Broken Hearted"" are very good songs. It's not a 5-star effort but it sure ain't ""awful."""
5,I should be completely disagree with you!!!,"I as a fan who has most of EC CDs in my collection can say this album is one of my favorites between them.Maybe its cuz I love these sort of music which you can see clouds of sadness in its sky but I can't understand why people give low rates to this album ??? Ya it is different from his other albums & thats why EC is EC.I've never heard anything from him,makes this feeling to me that I don't like it.I recomend everybody to just give it a chance & just judge about it yourself."
5,Great Job Eric!,"I have always enjoyed Eric Clapton's music. When I listened to ""Pilgrim,"" I just loved it! It is so relaxing, with a deep beat - you can really get into every song. Also, I am a Spinning instructor. I have used several of the songs from this CD on my Spinning tapes. The members love his bluesy style on those hills!"
5,Bravo! Eric,"Pilgrim is all about emotions - From "" only the broken hearted.. "" to ""...a world full of anger and no one to blame.."" through "" I wish that I could hold you one more time just to ease the pain..."" Listen to it carefully, it takes usually an artist a couple of decades to produce one - So enjoy!"
5,extraordinary work by Clapton,"Clapton proved again that he can outlast most of the superstars that started their career when he did. The music fan in New England needs to read the review by other stars like Rolling Stones before writing gaffes like that on line. If Clapton's days are gone, he should take time to redefine music for himself."
2,You must be a real EC lover not to be disappointed,"After ""Unplugged"" and ""From the Cradle"" I was really looking forward to this one but was badly disappointed. The music is plain boring with no point to it (except for a few rare moments). Lets hope he will find his way home to Blues."
2,"nice try, but no cigar","Clapton has impressed me before, but has let me down with this album. This is not his best effort. Some of the songs are cheesy, and a few are decent, but none strike me as great. ""My Father's Eyes"" is a mediocre track, but the rest is a bore."
5,Clapton is God,"I bought this CD back in March when it was released, dispite many of the UK critis destroying it. I listined, and I listened and the more I heard the album the more I love it. Pilgrum has turned me into a huge Clapton fan and I am now buying up everything he has released. Don't listen to the 'music critics' buy and enjoy."
1,"It may be heresy, but... it's just awful and kind of sad","This c.d. is for people who love Shania Twain and think Kenny G is great. This is the worst Clapton album I've ever owned (well, formerly owned). It reminds me of the 2 slick, souless and forgotten Arista albums recorded by the Allman Brothers (Reach for the Sky & Brothers of the Road) prior to their amazing comeback in the 90's. Avoid if you admire in any way the 60's and 70's EC music. I'm not giving up on Clapton like most critics have, but let's be honest: this is awful."
5,Timely relevant classic,This book outlines the best approach to making compost and is described in simple terms? There is good simple explanations on how to use the plants that make up biodynamic preparations
1,Don't Buy,"There are better glasses out there for the price. The ear pieces on this model crumble. This causes the glasses to slip off your face. The warranty won't cover the glasses if they slip off your face and break even if it's due to faulty ear pieces. Buy something else. The ""Life Time Warranty"" doesn't exist."
1,YUCK!,"this is the worst album in the world (WAY behide the spice girls even!!!)...the only song i like on here is ""fresh off the boat' the rest is...kinda like....very hard for me to say, but its almost as if shes trying to be anotehr avril lavigne! and i hate her! im sorry to say nelly furtado, but your second album sucks! but i still wish you the best. and hope u win another grammy? (if she even gets half that far with this album)!!!"
5,tremendous growth,"Nelly Furtado's second album, Folklore, shows tremendous growth from her debut album, which I thought was good in the first place. The sound of Folklore is much more fleshed out, with each track filled with world beats, acoustic instruments and just a hint of electronica (which was much more prevalent in her debut). This production suits Nelly's voice much better than the sparser material, and the result is that her voice sounds fantastic. Lyrically, marriage and motherhood have clearly inspired Nelly, because the lyrics, songwriting and delivery are all much more emotional and passionate. I once saw an interview with Nelly, and she said she wanted to be a ""career artist"". I believe she has the talent to be making great music for a long time."
4,The sophomore album curse? Not here,"I, like most, first heard Nelly Furtado's ""I'm Like A Bird"" on the radio. It was catchy, but sort of annoying, so I didn't think a lot of it. Then came ""Turn Off the Light"" and my interest was perked. A friend got me that first album for Christmas and I listened to it with eager ears. Very different, very good. Folklore came out and I knew I would want it, thinking there would be more of her interesting thoughts, catchy choruses and inventive instrumentation. Folklore has all of these things, but instead of the sometimes off-kilter music from the first album we are given a more acoustic Brazilian folk sound. The result is atmospheric and beautiful. Also beautiful is Furtado's voice. She has grown as a singer, and it shows throughout the entire album. Led by the powerful identity anthem ""Powerless,"" the album reads like Furtado's diary, and every entry is worth a look."
3,A SOLID ALBUM,"I had previously written off Nelly Furtado as a flavor-of-the-week in pop music. Shame on me! I was very surprised when I got a chance to preview this record. With her beautifully exotic look and her own unique sound and vocals, Furtado has the potential and talent to have a long-career in this use-em and lose-em business. There's something about her music that's very celebratory even though this record has a bit of a darker tone than her previous album. There's so much going on with the production, it's an absolute joy to listen to. There's hardly a weak track in the bunch. Recommended at 3 1/2 stars."
3,nice album,"I usually do not care what other peole think about the cds I listen to, but why is nobody saying what a great song ""The Grass is Green"" is? It has a great message and a great hook! It should be the next single! Overall a great cd and I am going to pick up her last one! Peace Out!"
2,Boys beware!,"I bought this album blind, being (still) so impressed with her first effort ""Whoa, Nelly!"" This one is chick music! None of the quirkyness, originality and sexy vocal escapades here. Just another average mainstream pop effort that is probably sounding alright to your average nurse but lacks edginess and spirit to satisfy the music connoisseur. You might as well buy something like Norah Jones or Shania Twain, yikes!"
1,yuck,"nelly furtado sucks and she can't sing. she sounds SO bad when she sings. she like...moans. and she likes Powerless cuz it ""blends cultures"" or some s*** like that. psh riiiight. does that mean you changing your clothes every five seconds??? she's such a bad singer and writes annoying music i have no idea how she could have fans. if u wanna check out GOOD music by girl singers check out: Katy Rose, Michelle Branch, Avril Lavigne or Lillix....those are female artists with actual...TALENTps-nelly, ur a disgrace to canada...we're known for our GOOD and TALENTED artists"
5,Innovative and awesome tracks.,"This CD is really awesome for anyone who is into deep, original sounding music. The tracks all have lyrics that can be taken literally and yet you can take it to a different more personal level. Songs like ""One Trick Pony"", ""Forca"", ""Powerless"", ""Childhood dreams"" and ""Grass is greener"" are awesome.After basically downloading the 1st album, I made a decision to purchase folklore since Nelly proved she isn't a 1 or 2 hot songs per cd type of artist, and she certainly is not.This album is so worth the money if your looking for something more than just a britney spears album.Its got meaning and its just a happy yet mature record, that I can't see myself get sick from.Representing awesome songwriters from BC!"
3,Hugely uneven sophomore set,"First off let me say that regardless of what Ms. Furtado does I'll always adore her. That said I'm majorly dissapointed in this disc. some great songs balance off some majorly horrible ones to make this disc a three. i saw her live in concert after her last album and she had introduced a lot more hip-hop and dance elements to her performance so basically I was expecting this album to go more in that direction but sadly it didn't. I'm sure she'll do work in the future but I'm saying WHOA!, Nelly on this one."
4,Newer Sound With Same Great Results,"""Folklore"" is a CD that the more you listen, the more you enjoy. Nelly Furtado is a singer with a truly great voice that tries to put out a CD where every track is a potential hit, and this one does just that. The sound is even more diverse/eclectic than her first CD, but it is an adventure well worth taking."
4,Nelly should stick to Folk,"I feel that out of her english pop albums this one is the best. Not saying that Loose isn't good because it is, as was Whoa Nelly! but I feel that those albums unlike this album were very mainstream and very much products of their respective times; 2001 and 2006. Folklore was made in 2003 but listening to it today it still sounds as fresh as when it was made. I really enjoy the lyrics and most of the songs are beyond good-one trick pony, powerless, explode, the grass is green, picture perfect, and saturdays, For fans of turn off the lights there's fresh off the boat. As a folkie myself I must say I truly appreciate this style and this album for Nelly. Mi Plan offers hope that she may return to this style-which I truly hope she does. She's made her money, time to make some more art. I know this album wasn't a best seller probably because it doesn't have club beats or dance pop which seems to be what's selling right now."
2,not that great,"I liked all of the songs played on the radio that were released from the first cd, but never ended up buying it, I heard the first single from this cd and thought what the hey I'll buy it it was on sale. I am very dispointed the whole cd lacks what I thought furtados music was about purrvian beats. My advice dont' buy this, get her first cd I wish i would have."
4,Comfortable saddle - even without padded shorts,I bought this seat for my wife after about 2 years of riding on the stock saddle that came with her mtn bike. We ride on average 2 times a month(1.5 hours) with an occasional 5 hour ride every couple months - this is our trail riding/actual mtn biking schedual with some local street riding to the beach etc. The first three rides on the butterfly had been to breakfast and short local rides on the street just in case it was not the seat for her and we needeed to exchange the saddle right away - but this was not necessary. At this point she is very happy with the seat and has no complaints or issues and she has even noted the comfort level has improved since there are not any noticable hot spots or pressure points.
2,"it's nice looking, but did not fit me","got chafed and bruised from this one. i think the cutout made me feel like i was being stuffed into the hole. i was hoping to like it better than the planet bike one (no bruises or chafing), because i don't like the way it looks, but i'm switching it back."
3,Gary Moore - Parisienne Walkways '93 - two CD single set,"This release includes a ""presentation case"" for holding 2 seperate CD singles. Both singles feature live tracks recorded on the 1992 tour. Two tracks from each single are available on Gary's BLUES ALIVE album, but each single also includes two live tracks not from the album & previously unreleased.Single One:1. Parisienne Walkways '932. Stop Messin' Around*3. Still Got The Blues4. You Don't Love Me*Single Two:1. Parisienne Walkways '932. Since I Met You Baby (with B.B. King)*3. Still Got The Blues4. Key To Love**bonus live tracks"
3,"Good price, fine music","Typical of any Naxos recording the music is completelyaverage. Not good, not bad, just normal. But what's more, this is agreat price! You don't find the Beethoven 9 symphonies for under ( ) anymore. Now don't buy this is if you want a 'recording of the century'. Buy this if you are frugal. END"
1,"30,000 leagues under the sea",OMG... I'd rather waste 2 hours rubbing peppers in my eye. Lets just say it was so bad that I had to type this review.
1,Don't waste your money!,"A poor remake of a classic Jules Vern story. The acting is flat and unbelievable. A movie of CGI and deceptive camera angles; low budget-low class, I could not even finish watching the movie. Don't waste your money!"
2,It is so hokey...,"No body who has seen a real submarine movieor even a good ""20000 leagues under the sea""remake knows that this is a very bad modernization of a classicin sci fi.The acting is bad, the writing is bad, and the special effects are minimal,and nobody is fooled.The sets costs more than this movie will probably ever make."
2,Doesn't really work,I don't know how well this works on helping you relax and fall asleep. It doesn't really do that for me. It tastes bad when placed directly in your mouth. Kind of like rubbing alcohol. Better off diluting it in water. The price is good. I have seen Bach Essences priced at up to $20 in health stores and spas.
4,Good quality tools! Kit is more for a homeowner.,"I have been doing construction for about three years and I pour concrete on occasion, probably a few times a month. I bought this because I needed some concrete tools. The quality of the tools are excellent, I only buy marshalltown for concrete tools. The kit itself is more for a homeowner do-it-yourselfer, not for a professional. The one thing this kit is missing is a big 5x20 inch finish trowel. I will mostly be using the mag float, which I love, the finish trowel, and the edger. Like I said, great quality tools, but the kit is more for a homeowner. If I were to do it again, I would have bought the tools I would actually use separately."
4,My son love's it!!!!! He plays with it everyday.,"I bought this for my son when he was just 10 months, he used it to help him walk and it was great. I really like the stopper in the back and since the front part was really heavy, it helped him balance whenever his ready to fall. Now that he's 1 he still rides this everyday... and all by himself.Its a great buy... I do have a few cons: I am not a fan of the mirror, it was easily scratched the first week and also the ""sew-saw"" doesnt start right away no matter how much you push the button to start it. Other than that..... WE LOVE IT!"
1,BEWAREnot a happy adventure with this ride-on,The mirror broke off when the toy fell on it's side. The music/voices sounds like it's dying. Changing the batteries does not help. Find a better Ride-On. Don't buy this one.
1,Yet another outdated product,"I tried this product in search of one that could give me the peace of mind that this type of product promises to do. Unfortunately this one has a lot of issues. For one thing it no longer supported. That can be understood as this product is about nine years old. I gave it a try despite the age of the product and found that this version also will not work with a lot of today's browsers. I tried just about all the browsers, even the less well known ones, and got the same result. It simply does not work with most websites. I also noticed that this product also caused my computer to crash a lot just like the other versions. The problem disappeared after I uninstalled it. This one went to the trash like the others."
2,Disappointing,"Perhaps my expectations were too great. I thought Pilgram at Tinker Creek was a unique approach to the eternal question of the goodness and badness of the world, and the nature of its creator. However, I found Dillard rather self-absorbed, and was not able to relate to her. While parts of the book are beautifully written, her style can be awkward and jarring at times. I'm glad Dillard was able to end her journey on a positive note of praise, but I didn't gain much from her experience."
3,Comprehending the Unnoticeable,"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek by Annie Dillard is a great book for those people who are ""better-than-average"" in comprehending something that is not easily found by just reading. Allusions play a big part to understanding the meaning to Dillard'd view. Biblical allusions, for examble, show us Dillard has a very religious and knowledgeable background. Her metaphors give light ro her work, too. The reader could read past the metaphor and not know that Dillard is expressing more than just her feelings. She will make you see more than what is really there. She will make you think. I could go on and on how Dillard is a great writing and how the average reader wouldn't see the unnoticable, but you must read the book to search the remarkable personality of Annie Dillard."
5,Return of the Pilgrim,"This is a third timeI have read this book and each time I come away changed. If you love nature and have questions about what it all means, read this book."
2,"dull, dull, dull, dull, dull","Too long, deliberately irritating, pretentious, disconnected, dares to be peculiar!"
2,pilgrim at tinker creek,"I found this book boring...I KNOW it was a Pulitzer prize winner. But, tome, oh, so boring...Annie Dillard is an excellent writer of course, and I loved her littlebook, The Writing Life."
5,Circular Effect,"Pilgrim at Tinker Creek was a great book. It was filled with prose and humor as well. I especially liked her writing style in the book. She maintained a ""circular"" effect throughout every chapter and even throughout the entire book. In the begining of the book, she starts off by describing how her cat leaves little pawprints of blood on her chest. At the end of the book, she, once again, talks about her ""old fighting tom"".Although Dillard didn't have a plot line, she was able to keep the story well organized by using the circular effect. She really knows how to write a book of prose pieces."
1,Utterly pointless,"I found this book on Amazon.com. I am an avid Barbara Kingsolver fan and thought I would try one of the books that was linked to Kingsolver's books. I chose this book for the bookclub I am hosting for twelve members this coming month.The book is utterly pointless. The writing is sometimes interesting and there are a few good thoughts, but mostly it is the disjointed and uneducated thoughts of a crazy person living on the edge of society.I have not finished the book and wish I had not subjected the other readers in my club to the ""story"". I cannot recommend this book."
1,This Book is Horrible.,"I had to read this book for an AP class, i don't recommend it to anyone unless you like books with a complete absence of plot or content. I could not finish the book, no matter how hard i tried."
