4,THE ONLY BENCHMARK FOR ALL GAMING HEADSETS...PERIOD!!,"This headphone kicks ass!! I've had this baby for 2 yrs now, and none....NONE can compare to this headphone! with independent speakers...not to mention the BASS! its heaven when playing BF3! I was totally immersed in the game with this baby! The bass setting and the THUMP!...you will experience real bass and joy! The only thing thats not cool is the voice/headphone, I have to constantly shout on the top of my lung for my friends to hear me communicate.....You just have to tone down the bass setting and sound setting. I would give this a 5 star but due to the microphone's lackluster....I give this baby 4.99 STAR! BUY IT! YOU WILL NOT REGRET! you will never ever buy another! I wish I can curse on how awesome this headphone is...but....!#@$@#! awesome!"
2,Shotty Quality,"Let me start by saying that I love Razer products, and I like to try out all that I can get my hands on. This headset sounded great, but unfortunately the build quality was such that it only stayed functional for about 2 months. I got a more sturdy Plantronics headset for use when gaming."
4,Razer HP Headphones,"Good set of headphones; I do like the little LEDs that light up the sides of the 'phones and with 8 channels give an avid gamer like me nearly in full surround-sound; especially helpful when you're heaing impaired AND trying to get sound quality as well as quantity.I've had them for about 10 months and I'm going to contact Razer and see if I can get them replaced as they've started to degrade. In other words, the sound quality has gone down as well as the volume. Here's hoping!"
1,Awesome headset if you buy 4 so you can have multple backups when they break,"Horrible design. After about 4 months they just fell apart. I had them taped together for about 6 months before I bought another pair offline from a major retail. I won't mention any names, but they claim their Buys are the Best. Anyway, bought another pair brand-new and within 6 months those fell apart too. I decided that it was the design and not the speakers themselves.The sound quality and all that...best I've ever had. Taping it together and looking like a duct-tape antenna...not so much."
2,American Feminists Seek Import Ban Of Foreign Brides,"If done judiciously international, internet dating could hardly be thought of as ""trafficking"" of women. One-sided accounts such as this do not accurately portray the motivations of the serious-minded men and women that meet using these services. Now, of course there are risks involved, as there are in any form of dating, that is why it is important to carefully consider both the risks and rewards of such a venture before acting. Those of you that would like to know more should consult the website."
4,Dead Men,"Wow, I can't believe Amazon even carries this. Really, Shikari are superfast screamo in the vein of Orchid. I'm not gonna sit here and rave about how this is the greatest album ever to exist and all that usual nonsense that no one ever pays attention to anyway. Just wanted to chime in cause I can't believe nobody posted about them yet. Like it matters."
4,Very tight but a overall great holster,"I bought this shoulder holster for my husbands Springfeild SD SUBCompact. The quality of the holster is amazing, it is 100% leather. This holster does require some assembly. Its not too hard to do but it might take several tries to get it a perfect fit. This only issue with this holster is the fact that it fit his gun too snug. This can become a issue as the point of having this holster is to be able to 1. conceal your weapon and 2. to be able to pull your weapon out quickly if a needed. The holster did come with instruction with instructions on how to get your holster to fit you gun and so far it is working just very slowly. Overall it is a very sturdy and nice quality holster. I would recommend to anyone who needs both a nice looking and functional holster. I give this product a 4.5 out of 5 just beacuse it take a while for the leather to break in and fit your weapon perfectly."
3,Actors were good but the DVD has the worst quality,"Actors were good but the DVD has the worst quality I've ever seen. My advice is don't buy it because of the bad quality of the DVD ( a lot of noise on the soundtrack, and the quality of the original that was used to do the mastering is awfull). Some words about the actors, they're good in them performance, but all the thing are messed by the bad quality of the DVD."
5,Susan Powter Rocks!,"I highly recommend any products by Susan Powter, even though she is a bit crazy (your children under 14 or so do not need to read some of them becasue she is a bit crass) but her advice is timeless, not faddish and right on. Great book."
2,No big deal...,"In Brazil, Kid Abelha is one of the most known and enduring pop bands that ever existe there. THey are from the city of Rio de Janeiro, and has in its female lead singer, Paula Toller, its best ingredient. She has a personal and soft voice, very charming indeed. But most of the songs are plain rubbish pop."
5,my kidslove all of these movies!,"My two boys, 5 & 7 yrs old, are simply obsessed with the acceleracer videos and cars! It started with the World race video, then we ultimately bought all of them, with this movie being the final in the series - or is it? The end was really left open for future movies, which my boys always talk about. I like the movies because they let the boys use their imaginations, there is no violence (except for car crashes, where almost no one ever gets hurt or killed) and the characters are colorful. The boys love to pretend with the cars (I finally bought some on ebay)and there is also a card game which they enjoy - they think it is all so cool, it is too cute!"
3,you're not missing much,"I bought all the ones that came out before this one. Thinking that they will do a better job (HotWheels). They failed me big time. This was done very fast, and too many details missing. I don't know where they are going with this, but the whole collection realy is not worth it. My 7 year old like it, but not I nor my 10 year old do. I think it is badly done, but I gave it a 3 star because of my 7 y/o son. I hate to say this for a HotWheels product but "" I seriously do not recomend this whole series""."
3,Snarky fun,"While not a super yuk-fest a'la Blades Of Glory, it is a solid piece of dark, quirky comedy from a woman's point of view. Similar to the show Girls. Anne Heche seems to get stronger and more funny every year, when given a troubled, to-smart-for-her-own-good part like this one."
1,Had potential...,This movie was not very good. It's a shame because I do think it had potential. I think that a different cast would have made it a decent movie.
2,Panasonic 160,"I have owned this product for a couple of years now. Bought it directly from Panasonic. Reproduces very good. I found it very annoying that it depletes batteries very quickly, in a couple of weeks even when disconnected. Also construction is very poor and the case lost the printed indications and color very quickly; looked beaten up in less than six months."
4,I like it.,I used this to voice record my evil baby sitter (whom I later on fired) while my wife and I were at work and heard EVERYTHING. There are 3 levels of recording. The lowest quality last 8 hours while the highest quality last 2 hours. It has 4 folders organization. My only gripe is that I cannot selectively delete the middle of a clip. The voice activation thing works great too.
1,Useless. Scattered information,What a great dissappointment. Bought the book since MPLS is becoming so popular. It is scattered information thrown together. Doesn't qualify as a book.
1,HILARIOUS!,Provides great insight into christian paranoia while being able to make you laugh at the same time. Very funny stuff
4,Like throwing Holy Water on the Possessed !,This was one of many books from my church library I got to read while recording the service from a side room every week.I was so impressed that I bought a copy to show banking relatives.Truly I swear to God its like throwing Holy Water on the Possessed.This book has been my most powerful tool to separate the wheat from the chaff over the years.If it were not for talk radio shows like Coast to Coast and people like Mary Relfe & Jim Marrs writing books that shine the light of truth on these Satan worshiping rats. We would already be chipped slaves of the 4th Reich.
3,It Has Merit,I am reading many books by the Rabbi right now and this compliments his other books and teachings.
3,steamer,"lid rattels when steam builds up presure, then spits water out.Would look at others, needs vent hole."
1,Inappropriate in every way,It is difficult to believe that two adoptive mothers wrote this book. The book is so inappropriate for children. They have the audacity of comparing adopting a pet to adopting a child. I don't know what the people were thinking that wrote it.
1,Did nothing for me,"I tried this product with the fertility cleanse kit. I can't say it did anything for me. If you research the individual ingredients from a legitimate source (e.g. consumer labs or the NIH), you won't find anything to support the claims of what it is supposed to do for the liver. I also didn't notice any improvements in my cycle which this was supposed to help with."
1,I didn't like these bibs,"I was buying these bibs for my infant, so I needed them to absorb milk as I gave her a bottle. The milk seems to roll off the bib instead of being quickly absorbed. Perhaps these are better for an older infant who is eating solids."
4,Isolated in USA?,An evocative documentary with effective use of sight & sound. My first introduction to an apparently world-class poet. Search on Amazon and in typically extensive holdings of large local public library system results in zero items for further reading. How culture bound are we oh so sophisticated North American readers?
5,A must for girls of all ages.,"This book provides exquisite illustrations that girls of all ages can certainly relate to. The contributions of many famous and classic authors, including scripture writings, provide for excellent and meaningful reading. A book to be passed down from generation to generation."
4,Very sweet,"Not quite as poignant as ""What Little Boys are Made Of"", but still a delightful book. Perfect gift for a new baby girl."
3,A Classic with limitations,Though overall this is a pretty good show I just couldn't get past the fact that both the video and audio quality very clearly shows the limitations of the technology of the 70's. I believe they did as well as they could trying to remaster this but no need to bother with bluray on this. A regular DVD (or even VHS) would more than suffice. On the plus side you do get to see the band at a relatively young age and the energy they brought to their shows back then. Also Keith Moon was still alive and present in this DVD. I'm going to try to find a more current Who concert to compliment this one.
2,You can do much better,"Townshend understandably did not want this footage released. The band was on shakey ground and that transfered into their performance. Daltrey forgets the words to ""Dreaming from the waist"". Townshend shouts at the audience that both the band suck and Jeff Stein should stop waisting film. They did not have a set-list and had minimal practice before the concert. While it is nice to see additional footage of the original Who, this clearly is a poor performance. Purchase the following Who DVD's 1st: Live at the Isle of Wright (their best concert footage), The Kids are alright, Live at the Royal Albert Hall and Amazing Journey. After these top-shelf DVD's it's all downhill."
4,Final,"Raw, pretty decent sound, focus on the band not the crowd...this is the blurry to buy!! Any Who fan should own it."
4,Excellent for the new fans of THE WHO,"Well, didnt know that much about the band, but this bluray deffinently introduced me to the legend. buy if you want to here the best spng of ""the who""."
3,The Who Kilburn Blu-ray,"The Kilburn footage is awesome while the Tommy footage is not. The audio on the Tommy stuff is great the video is bootleg quality at best. It's nice to have something rather than nothing, however do not expect too much on the Tommy footage."
1,DON'T BLAME KEITH MOON,"Usually I am pretty easy to please but not in this case. This is not a good concert. The whole band is flat and lackluster. The version of ""Who Are You"" is terrible. The audience was alseep the whole time. Dont blame Keith Moon as the whole band is out of sync. Its a shame because the sound and video itself is of good quality. If they weren't on drugs they should of been. I guess it's good for historicial purposes as it features the original band"
2,Great Quality - Horrendous Performance,"So I just bought this DVD a week ago. The sound and video on it are out of this world, really great quality. But the performance by the band is HORRIBLE! Now I get it, with all the other reviews, it's the original Who so people have to revere them. I am a die-hard Who fan myself but Entwistle plays sub-par in this concert. He completely botches ""Tommy's Holiday Camp"" screws up the entire second half of ""i'm Free"" prompting Townsend to look at him and say ""We might as well send the Cameras home,"" and forgets to come in on the verse to ""My Wife,"" Keith Moon is at his most pathetic and un-rehearsed, Townsend looks like a miserable old man, and Daltrey even forgets words and such. This performance even looks worse because of the 1969 concert on disc 2. This concert shows the Who at there pinnacle. Bottom line is, Great visuals/ Horrendous performance."
2,Boring,"Let me first say, I love The Who. This unfortunately is a boring concert. I might even add cheesy. I feel more energy listening to studio recordings. The real diehards will claim anything their favorite band does is fantastic, but this doesn't hold up. I literally found myself watching and wondering when I'd feel a little adrenaline, but that moment never really came. I see several live shows a year and this just didn't come close to representing good live music. If you are interested in owning the concert for the history making reunion aspects, get it. If you expect to rock out, don't."
3,blu-ray judders,just got the blu-ray on opening day. expect quite a bit a guess but the video has a lot of judder like it running at 12fps not 24. anyone else experiencing this?
2,Jarring visuals,I found the video jarring. The camera pans or zooms wildly and scenes cut rapidly. You don't get a chance to register the image before the angle changes.
3,live at kilburn,"is it just me or am i the only one that cant hear any guitar in this flim , i havent watched disk 2 yet mostly for the dissapointment of disk 1 , im an audio engineer who owns a recording studio and it seems to me that the guy who was recording this show forgot to hit the record button on the guitar channel , no wonder it sat in a vault for 35 years , but its still important for all the bass players of the world who want to really focus in on what john entwistle is doing cause that comes thru loud and clear without the challenge of the guitar"
5,The Real Who,"The Who at Kilburn was never meant to be released as an entire concert. Jeff Stein had planned to use parts of itfor the documentary ""The Kids Are Alright"". The band comes out very rough at first. Townshend seems a bit disinterested.He hits a ton of bum chords at the start. Moon is very rusty. Daltrey and Entwistle carry the load till the rest of the band catches up. At mid-point of the show everything seems to click. This is a must have if you are a big Who fan. Also a good way to start an appreciation of this band.Disk 2 is a 1969 concert at the London Coliseum. The quality is sub-par. The lighting and film quality are dicey at best.You will need a quality system to get anything out of the audio. But when you realize that this film was found in the trash, you can live with it. The complete ""Tommy"" and ""A Quick One While He's Away"" are the highlights on the extras.A piece of history which should not be missed."
4,The Who 1977 - Fair,"My husband is a fan of The Who and according to him this Blue Ray is just fair. On the positive side, it contains two complete concerts."
5,The 1969 Show is a MUST,"If you want to see the greatest live rock band of all time in their prime, then purchase this DVD for the 1969 London Concert. The band is a well oiled machine in full glory. The music sounds stellar, the vocals sound stellar, and the focus and conviction of their performance is unparalleled in any era of rock music. If you are expecting a slick, quick cut, live concert film then you will be disappointed, but if you are looking to have your head smashed in by a rock and roll tank rolling over it by it now!!"
4,Mod Punks,At the height of 1977 UK punk hysteria The Who out punk the punks with their bloozey R&B power mod rock energy and mayhem. Keith Moon actually holds this together quite nicely despite all of the drunken chaos. Great!
4,Great for a Who fan,"Feels like more ""candid"" footage of the band. Luckily the cameras also seem to capture John and Keith more than most products I've seen. The Blu-ray transfer is nice, but I don't think the quality was all that great to begin with."
5,Kilburn is best Who bar none,"I have lots of Who videos that I enjoy, but this is the best. They could not have played better than they did in Kilburn. Everything was really right on. Daltrey's voice, Moon's antics and drumming, Townshend's guitar work and gymnastic, and the underrated late, great bassist, John Enwistle. The man played the bass like a lead!Excellent!"
5,Great gloves for men with small hands,"As a man, I have difficulty finding men's gloves in small. These women's gloves fit perfectly. They are excellent gardening gloves; I use them to wear while cutting the lawn. The leather is wonderfully pliable and comfortable and seem tough enough to last. These gloves are also attractive, almost elegant. I heartily recommend them."
3,Tight fitting..,"I was worried to order these without a size listed, and they're a tad tight getting them on, the opening could be a little bigger.My hand measures 7 inches around the knuckles. The glove opening is 8 inches, so squeezing my hand in is a little difficult, more so the second glove when trying to pull it on with the other hand gloved. (my hand measures almost 9 inches around at the widest point - including the base of my thumb, measured flat around, I can scrunch it up a bit)The fingers are a tad too long on me, which is ok - I'm not going to a fashion show, but it might annoy after a while. (although with longer nails it might be a good thing)If you're unsure of fit, tie a piece of string to 8 inches and try squeeze your hand through, or measure another glove if you have one.I would buy these again, if they wear out and I need more, the leather is nice and soft."
3,good enough and a compelling price,"I needed to replace garden gloves. The price was compelling. They fit and work well enough, but they are pretty smelly (chemical or petroleum scent?) and one pair was not well matched (one glove was stiff while the other was pretty soft and slightly larger). Not perfect, but much less expensive than I could find locally."
3,RUN SMALL,"Price is right, however they run very small. Applied mink oil to stretch them out but only softened them up."
3,Washable leather gloves,"Gloves fit well, were heavy enough to handle heavy lawn jobs without getting into the super-heavy gloves. I like the ""washable"" aspect, but have not yet needed to wash them. Good Purchase"
5,Softer every time you wear them,"These gloves are sorta stiff when you first get them, but every time you wear them they get softer and softer. I had a similar pair I bought overseas for many many years and finally had to throw them away because they were just worn out (I think a squirrel chowed down on them). Love the 3-pack because I can have one pair in the house, one pair on the back deck, and one pair down in my potting shed. I would recommend these gloves to anyone who, like me, loathes garden gloves."
5,I loved it!!,Very interesting about Dan's life! Ohh I loved to know everything about him! He is the perfect one!!!
1,A Plethora of Adjectivism,"This book spent more time trying to impress the reader with a superfluidity of adjectives than on the substance of the story. This author's efforts to skip from the past to the present in parallel stories drops the reader somewhere in the middle! Not a bad story line, but a botched attempt at suspense. This was not a nail-biter; this was not a page burner; it was laborious to follow the story with the constant interruptions and overwriting on inconsequential elements of the story. Her next book can only be better!"
2,Only if you're a fanatic,"Admittedly, I purchased this one sight unseen. From the description, I assumed there would be summarized encyclopedic information (stats, records, earnings, etc.), but there is none of that. Only a few chronological listings of specific events. And those don't even list earnings, just scores. Then there's a section with very short biographies of the top 200 (in the editors opinion) players and the top courses. All in all, this is a book of lists with a few historical scores, not an encyclopedia."
2,Hand blender review,Worked well for abour a year and quit. This model is not recommended because of price and length of useful life. Bought a more powerfull hand blender Cuisinart with several attachments that is very powerful and works great.
5,Works great for my use,"I use this primarily to puree soups in the pot, and for that purpose this works very well. Plenty of power, easy to control.I also find it easy to clean, just ""blend"" some water with a bit of soap in it like the instruction manual suggests, then rinse clean. Making this a two-piece unit for the sake of throwing part of it in a dishwasher wouldn't improve the speed or ease of cleaning in my opinion.There may be units available that are even more powerful and rugged, but for the money this is a 5 star item."
1,Tiny Metal parts broke off into my blended drink!,"Great item. Loved it, until... Tiny metal washers broke in half and fell into my milkshake and cut my mouth. Contacted the company, who said ""sorry, out of warrantee"". Didn't realize there was a warranty period on caring about customer safety. Thank goodness it wasn't a broken blade on my Cuisinart food processor that slit my throat, guess that wouldn't matter much either if it was ""out of warrantee"". SHAME ON YOU CUISINART/CONAIR!!!"
3,"Sexy, but...",All that book and no resolution on why Ben's partner did what he did??? That was what I was left with feeling at the end. Which overshadowed the story.
2,Sorry Linda,This isn't the book for but some love it. What else can I say? Too many cliches and you know exactly what is going to happen next.
3,foil broiler pans,"broiler pans were fine, typical of anything purchased off the shelf, problem was the post office. Pans were received badly bent. Did contact the vendor on it and they made it right."
4,something different,"having been an avid wwii reader for many years, i found this book to be a welcome change of pace from the usaual run of the mill, bog standard wwii book.i do of course realize that there are very many excellent studies of this period of time available,and i own many, but i loved this book for the excellent way it was written, and mainly for the mental images it put into my head.the eastern front has always been of special interest to me and to read something completely different about it, and learn new aspects of it was truley welcome.(i know i cant spell)."
3,"Classic ""Deem Sum"" as Viewed by a Western Reader","An excellent starter guide to dim sum, with recipes for steamed, pan-fried, roasted, and (of course) deep-fried dishes. Excellent recipe for pork bun filling (although not a great dough recipe); lotus leaf (""sticky"") rice; crab cheese wontons (""crab rangoon""); turnip cakes; har gow; and custard tarts.For the best baked bun dough, consult The Dim Sum Book. For steamed bun dough, consult The Chinese People's Cookbook. However, use the filling from this book as it's more authentic in flavor.Enjoy!"
3,meh,"I spent a good deal of time installing this unit in my Honda Odyssey under the passenger side seat.After completing the install, I powered it up and was wondering if it was on. I turned the remote up all the way, adjusted the levels. I put in a bumpin CD and was not that impressed. It does add some bass, but not all that the other reviews boast. If I could do it over again, I'd go with something else."
5,"This is a great Subwoofer, It's sound like you have two woofers in your car.","If you want alot of sounds but don't have the room for it in your car, you should by this."
2,A hit or a miss,"In combination with my Alpine CDA-9833, this Boss sub sounded like junk. I could not get the bass to sound decent between any 2 songs after MANY configuration variations, and I returned it to Amazon. This is the second Boss product I have dealt with recently (low profile 10"" sub w/ built in amp) and I was very disappointed this time."
1,800-Watts. Really!,"Seriously, I really don't know how they did the math to rate this amplified sub at 800-Watts. My speakers deliver a lot more bass than this unit and I am not talking about top notch speakers. I usually glance over some reviews before buying something but frankly, I cannot understanding how is it possible that 6 people have given this product 6 stars. It's a joke ! right? Do yourself a favor add $20 to $30 more and get something else."
5,A must read for the the true student,"Sokei-an has a knack for taking abstract, eastern concepts and translating them into something that western minds can understand. Even though he's been dead for 60 some odd years, when people ask me who my Roshi is, I say ""Sokei-an"". He is, without a doubt, the single greatest source of my attaining Kensho.If you are serious about Zen, read this book and it's sister, Zen Pivots. You won't regret it."
4,"Very Informative, and Very Realistic","I bought this book wanting to know a little about the reality of terrorism. Terrorism: Theirs and Ours does just that. It gives the reader an accurate idea of what it is like, as well as what what the other side feels. The truly amazing thing about this book is that it was written before 9-11, before George W Bush bought, and cheated his way into being president. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who wants to know the truth not only about Terrorism, but he United States invovlement in Terrorism."
5,Works well,"Does everything it says, and at a good price. My water tastes cleaner and looks clearer than before. It was easy to set up, requiring no tools. Just screw on the apparatus (with your hands) and go."
5,Should have bought one sooner,Love the filter. Took about 30 seconds to put on my sink. Easy to use and produces great tasting water.
3,Water filter,Bought this for our RV. Regular RV filters too big and too expensive. I like what it filters but when it is attached to the faucet the water does not come out in a straight stream and we have to use a funnel to get it in the container
3,Don't know it's working or not,"I don't know this filter is working or not, I test it with a TDS(Total Dissolved Solids) reader, both came out the result of 183ppm(new filter), so with or without the filter is the same, maybe it did reduce the odor, but no apparent it reduce other impurities"
4,Need adapter,"This filter will not fit up inside my DELTA 11946-SSSD BELLINI faucet. One of the adapters does fit up inside the faucet, but the swivel collar on the filter housing must screw onto this adapter. That swivel collar will NOT fit up inside the faucet. It's almost -but not quite- small enough to fit up in there. I need an adapter that is long enough to extend to the outside of the faucet so the swivel collar can be screwed onto it. I tried adding still another washer inside, but that did not help. I ended up attaching the filter to the faucet in my laundry room sink. That was easy, but it is a bit inconvenient to have it out there instead of in the kitchen. I did not see an option for contacting seller or I would have done that instead of writing this review. If seller reads these reviews, hopefully there will be a response. (I had to give a rating in order to have this accepted.)"
4,Not bad at all...,"I've had the filter for about a month now and can't say anything negative about it-- but I'm not bowled over by it either. I can't say that it appreciably reduced my water pressure when not in use, and while the flow coming through the filter isn't terribly strong, it's about what a friend gets through his under-sink unit. It installed easily, although I did have to give it a little help with pliers to get it snug enough not to leak. I'm not knocked out by the taste-- I don't drink bottled water, so this filtered water seems a little blah when compared to the ""tasty"" unfiltered water. Haven't decided if I'll get a replacement filter in a couple months, or just take it off the faucet. I don't doubt that the filtered water is healthier, so I'll probably keep it. It does what it does and it was under $20, so it's worth the fourth star."
5,GREAT WATER PURIFYER!,Ordered this 3days ago and already got it in the mail today!!! it was VERY easy to put on and the water tastes very good would defintly recommend this to any one! Its alot better for the enviorment than water bottles and cheaper too!
5,Good Filter,"We bought this filter to replace one we'd used for ages, the old one finally broke at the top and water was spewing out, but it's such a good filter I had no hesitation in ordering another just like it. Plan to enjoy this one for a long time to come."
3,"Sorry, very slowly!!","Really, this filter reduces bad odor and taste in the water and has a good price, but after a few weeks it turns very slow."
4,Decent for the price,"This filter does the job, however, there are a couple down points. It seems the water pressure drops substantially with this filter attached to the faucet, the filtered water also comes out pretty darn slow compared to other filters, and if you don't have good water pressure to start with the switch will not stay put. Other than that its economic, and it works fine with perfectly filtered water."
2,What a disappointment!,"I have not blindly chosen just any faucet filter since I've carefully read through many reviews and many more different types of products. Sure Culligan Faucet Filter got many good reviews, but it fell short of all expectations in my case. The filter worked decently the first week (though the water was never really clean); the little knob on the side soon got stuck, preventing the water from switching back to normal mode in just a few days. On top of that, the water pressure was never very fast to begin with, but after just a week, the water seems to be even slower than normal, and is pretty much ""leaking"" out from the faucet rather than pouring out. I tried everything I could with twisting/moving the filter inside around, but no help. So much for the filter lasting about 2 months.This product is a disappointment! I suggest that you do more research before you decide on this product."
5,Great Value! Better tasting water.,"I have had this for almost 2 years now and have not had any problems with it. No cracks, leaks...nothing but better tasting water. The replacement filters are less expensive than Pur, Brita...and last twice as long. I tried the other brands, but the fittings were plastic and within a few months, they would break. Heck, the Pur didn't even last a day. This is less expensive that the competition, but is better in it's construction. Sure, if you want a ""cool"" looking filter, go with Pur. If you want something made to last, buy this."
3,Annoying squeak,"This was a great little unit until I had to change the filter. After the first filter change, there was an annoying squeak/screech whenever you turned the water on (whether using the filtered water or not). Decided to replace the whole unit after about 15 months."
4,"It looks clunky on the faucet, but it works well","We already have a filter on our fridge for drinking water, but it was defeating the purpose of cooling the water when often we were using it for cooking. We picked up this Culligan Faucet Filter to remedy that.When it comes to boiling pasta this filter has been great. We used to get an aftertaste if we used unfiltered tap water, but this filter really does make the water taste like...well, water.We have a stainless sink and chrome faucet, so the white filter attached to it looks a little clunky. Definitely a function over form for us, though.Replacement 2-month filters through Amazon are economical as well.Culligan FM-15RA Level 3 Faucet Filter Replacement Cartridge"
3,Works fine except the little valve and a plastic coloration issue,"I think this is my first review of a product on Amazon, but it's not so much a review as it is just a simple experience report.The valve mechanism is sticking on mine like others have reported here. I even cleaned it out and applied a bit of mineral oil to the mechanics of it after the first filter change. Still sticking (?). I am on good tap water and have only been using it 4 months, but this issue started while on the first filter (within 90 days).That and the plastic has turned from pure white to a light shade of purple (UV exposure I am guessing). I have had one other white plastic product turn a light shade of purple like this - a white plastic dog treats container. I have fluorescents; though I don't leave them on for long periods, so this color issue happened rather quickly.Will still use the product though."
3,"does not feet to Kohler pitcher ,","i really love this filter , but it does not feet my kohler sistem , i guess the adapter is not good .have to return it"
3,Filter,Pros: I like the profile of it. Doesn't get in the way.Cons: Water flows very slow.Also the water doesn't taste as well as the Brita did.
4,Still lovin it,"I've had this filter for over a year and haven't had to deal with water that tastes like chlorine since! It's easy to install and works great.The only reason I didn't give it the final star is because it will leak if not screwed on JUST RIGHT, but a few moments messing with it, and it's golden.It's just two of us in our home now, so I only replace the filter every 3 instead of 2 months, when the water isn't looking as clear.So far so good!"
5,Jim,This product really works and was easy to install. I have tried aoths but was not satified and it is the right size.
4,Works Great.,I was able to install the filter on my laundry room faucet in about 10 seconds. And after 10 minutes of letting the water run through the filter - I had a glass of great water. The water in my town tastes awful and so I have been buying drinking water which is an unnecessary expense. I feel good about this purchase.
5,Works wonderfully,"I've been using this filter for a couple of weeks now and couldn't be happier with the product. I instantly noticed great improvement in my tap water, which previously had a slight odor and unpleasant taste. As a result, I've not only stopped purchasing bottled water from the store, but I'm drinking much more water because it's now so pleasant and cost effective. The one issue I had is that the supplied adapters did not work with my faucet, which has external threads but is too small in diameter for the filter. Lowe's didn't have what I needed, so I went to a local plumbing supply store and they easily found what I needed. I will post a picture of the adapter for those of you who have this issue."
3,worked ok at first.,worked ok at first. Then it began leaking pretty badly. you'd probably want to to replace the whole unit as oppose to trying to buy filters. I would not purchase again.
2,It needs high water pressure,"I bought this thinking It would help me to clean the water but It was not that way. Problem: It needs very high water pressure, so be sure of that first."
2,Agonizingly low flow,"I want so much to give this product a good review. The water coming out of it tastes great and no longer smells like heavy metals. Its insultingly low flow, however, forces an hour to pass before filling a gallon-sized jug. It's come to the point where we avoid the sink in which this filter is installed. Best left on a faucet the only use of which is to rinse toothbrushes. Perhaps the water pressure in this old house is too low to do the product justice. We'll never know."
2,SLOW,"I do not know how good is the water comes out of the filter, but I can tell you that the flow rate is extremely slow. On the unfiltered side, flow rate is reduced by half. On the filtered side, flow rate is reduced to less than 1/10 of the original flow rate.Make sure you use the rubber or it will leak."
1,Water pressure is terrible.,"Not only the the water coming thru the filter come out too slow, but the water coming thru the faucet without using the filter is too slow. It is barely enough to be aereated. I will not make this mistake again. Give me the option to conserve water with a removable part. Don't force me to conserve water if I chose not to."
2,"Leaky, Broken Diverter","After about a week the tap adapter started leaking and the diverter stopped automatically returning to the tap position when the water is turned off. Cheaply made, you get what you pay for."
3,Just another filter,It is easy to install but taste is not great. Pressure is poor. Just another filter.
2,Not all that happy with the Culligan 15 A faucet water filter,"Easy to install but the one I got leaks around the filter. I have spent around $60. on new filters and the thingstill leads.The button that is suppose to turn the filter off has never worked. Suppose to automatically turn filter off whenyou turn the water off.Keep your receipt if you buy one, ""good Luck""."
3,"water taste bad, replaceemnt cartridge hard to find","I bought this based on the high review rating here. But the water still tasted out from the tap.Can not find the replacement cartridge in the hardware store here, need to purchase that online when the time comes.Should have bought a more common brand, Brita/Pur."
2,"great design, but does not adequately filter water.","I bought this unit after my third Pur unit started leaking. I love that it can swivel and I love how the pull knob that turns the filter on will pop back in automatically when you shut the water off. However the filter itself is not very effective. My city has pretty strong chlorine flavor in the water. The Pur filters (2 stage and 3 stage) removed this entirely, it was completely imperceptible. This Culligan filter does slightly reduce it (I did a blind taste test to confirm this) but it does not come anywhere close to the Pur. The water still has a strong chlorine flavor, almost as bad as straight tap water. It is not good enough to keep my wife from buying bottled water, so I am returning it.I guess I am going back to the poorly designed Pur simply because it filters better. I may do as another reviewer mentioned and get it at Costco for the returns."
4,Does what expected,"Wasn't expecting a whole lot from a mountable filter, but it did increase the taste of the water noticeably.Pros-Easily mountable-Includes extra fittings to fit multiple size faucets-Design isn't too bulky to get in the way of dish washing-Push in pin design, which controls whether or not water is being filtered, automatically pops out when water is turned off so you don't waste filtered water when washing or rinsing dishes-Increased taste of waterCons-Mount sometimes loosens when maneuvering the faucet-Pin sometimes sticks in the filtered position and needs to be manually pulled out, even after turning the water offNot sure what or how much is being filtered because I didn't look into it prior, but if you want a filter that will increase taste, you can't go wrong with this filter."
4,Good Filter,The filter works well. Water has good taste. Easy to install. The only gripe that I have is that the plastic is starting to discolor. The plastic used to be white but now it has a purple tint to it. I have been using it for about 6 months.
2,Not a good fit,"I got this filter because the Pur filter kept cracking so I wanted to try something new. When I read all the great review I thought for sure this would be perfect. I even bought a replacement filter. When I hooked it up water started spraying from between the attachment and the filter so I was going to return it. They only gave me a week so I had to keep it because I was going on vacation and was not going to be able to get to a post office before I left which was the next morning early. So, I have a heavy paperweight! Great! :("
4,"Cheap, better than others, long lasting, simple.","I love this product. Elegant in its simplicity, it's much better than the Pur faucet filter and the plastic Brita pitchers. I don't understand the Brita pitchers- why filter out the impurities when the water is sitting for a day in plastic? The 200 gallon life of the filters makes this cheaper than others. I like the swivel feature of the filter. You can swivel it back when you're using the faucet for other things and swivel it forward when you need your glass to get closer to it.Update three months after first use: the daily swiveling that the filter gets has caused the faucet filter to loosen, so the water is beginning to leak from the main faucet. I have to tighten it constantly. Also, the valve is beginning to get stuck in the filter setting after turning off the water, whereas before it would switch back to the normal faucet mode."
1,Leaks; does not contain appropriate mounting hardware,"This filter did not fit properly on our kitchen faucet. (We have a standard faucet, not something fancy, special-order, or otherwise odd-sized.) We tried all the o-rings included with the filter but none worked -- the leaking was unacceptable. We were quite surprised, as we have been able to mount other filters with no problem (unfortunately, none lasted long, which is why we decided to try this one). We would have had to go to the hardware store and try to find o-rings that would work, but the whole point of our buying this model from Amazon was to avoid having to go to the hardware store. Luckily, Amazon has a hassle-free return policy (which is a big reason we shop here)."
1,Water tested the Same: Zero Filtration,"I installed the faucet filter, following instructions exactly.But after a few days I realized I couldn't taste any difference between the cholorinated tap water and the filtered water - in fact, I had never noticed a difference. So I bought a water tester and discovered it wasn't filtering anything. My tap score was 425-430, culligan was 425-430, and bottled water was 005 for particulates.What a complete failure."
2,"No Water Pressure, Even For the Unfiltered","perks-good taste-easy installcons-slowwwwww. And I'm talking about the unfiltered side. Its so inconvenient that I had to give 2 stars, and I'm thinking about removing it. I can't clean my dishes because there is not enough pressure on either side. The filtered flows just as fast as the unfiltered. pretty decent for the filtered side but unacceptable for the unfiltered.I have to use my sprayer all the time now when I want to wash my dishes"
2,Can't taste a diffrence in the water,"I bought this in hopes of having a better quality of water.It was easy to install, but the water quality was almost the same. and the little handle that you pulled out stopped working after 2 weeks. I won't be buying this again. I will look for a better quality product."
3,Culligan Water Filter,"Positives: Removed the funny taste from the tap water. Pretty easy to install. Not that expensive, but I wouldn't say it's priced cheap either for what it is.Negatives: Gets in the way. Decreases sink vertical air space by 2 inches. Looks bad. Slows down water flow considerably."
4,Better tasting water,"The water here smells awful and tastes terrible. This filter takes care of that. Now the tap water tastes just like bottled water. After several months, it is still working fine, although the shut-off valve sticks a bit. It works much better than the last two PUR filters I had, which started leaking after a couple of months."
4,Does the job,"I purchased this in order to slow down my faucet. Having a filter is a nice extra (We don't really need to filter Oregon water).It was easy to install but required a couple of re-tightenings. Best fit was using channel locks. I do have to remove the unit to use my sink-attached dishwasher, but it is not difficult, especially with the channel locks.I would recommend this. At about $15, it is a no brainer."
2,Annoying!,We have tried this as a last resort. Previously used Peer and they would always leak or be inthe way. Went to a filtered pitcher for the fridge.
5,Will buy another.,"Works great, price was right. Have had it on the sink for nearly two years and have been switching out the filters every few months. Makes the water much fresher than the old copper pipe taste it had before. It has started to leak out the side that attaches to the faucet but that is to be expected. Two years, three kids, my wife, and myself who has banged and beaten the heck out of this thing. Im surprised it didn't break sooner but we will see if I can get two more years out of the next one."
4,Pretty good,"So far so good with this filter. It doesnt leak like my ""pur"" did.One drawback is that you can't tell when the cartrige needs changing."
5,"Tried many, love the Culligan","I've previously used Brita pitcher filters and the PUR faucet filter. The Brita pitcher is nice since it's portable, but it's slow, takes up space and a lot of times- does not filter fast enough to keep up with all the water I use. The PUR faucet had a plastic faucet attachment which broke. This Culligan filter is the best filter I've ever used. It's very easy to install, smaller than the other filters, and quality water. The price is very reasonable too."
3,UNHAPPY,BOUGHT THIS FILTER FROM READING REVIEWSafter installing filter i come to find out it takes 3 hands to operate this filter...what a water waster
2,faucet filter,I really don't know if this product is good or not as I could not install it on my faucet. My faucet is apparently metric and there wasn't any adapter that fit. I had to return it.
2,Will crack after 2 years,I was very happy with this product until the plastic began to CRACK then completely BUSTED and will no longer filter water. I called the Culligan corporate office to complain and they refused to help me or replace the product. I WILL NO LONGER SUPPORT CULLIGAN DUE TO IT'S POOR CARE FOR THEIR CONSUMERS!
4,good filter but....,"This filter seems much better than other faucet filters I've used in the past. Totally takes out any chlorine odor. However, it is supposed to be changed every two months where my other one was three months plus sometimes the little pull out valve stem sticks so the filter stays on all the time instead of popping back in for non filter use. Still, I would buy this over the less expensive products because I do think it works better."
1,Not Happy,"I followed the directions, let the water run for 10 minutes before using, filled up the bottle. Originally tried the water and it tasted fine, thought I found a great solution from buying delivered water. Especially since the two companies that deliver in my area get their water from the town I live in and is the same water that comes out of the tap.The problem was after a day or two it had a metalic taste to it. At first it did not bother me but after a couple of days i gave up. Everythign we made with the water had the same taste. I went ahead and cleared out my dispenser put a new bottle that i purchased and tried it. It also had the metal taste for the first couple of days now it is fine.Unfortunately i did not save the box to return it."
1,Wish I could tell you more!,"No problem with the order or delivery, but it doesn't fit my faucet. Home depot doesn't sell an adapter that works. I'm going to have to go to a pluming supply store to try and find a solution. This is a real pain in the butt for a simple water filter!"
1,Useless,Impossible to install in a way that does not spray water all over the kitchen. Simply this is useless junk.
4,great little filter,"we bought this filter a little over a year ago and it really does work well! several months after we first installed it, i noticed that our water was beginning to smell and taste strange. we then realized that we were well overdue for a filter change! we put in a new filter and the difference was incredible. once you get used to your clean, filtered water, you'll really be able to taste the difference in unfiltered water.installation was easy and i like the size of it. i've tried several different kinds of faucet filters and i've found this one to the be the most compact and unobtrusive. it can run a little slow, especially towards the end of the filter's life, but that's just because all the crud that it's filtered out starts to clog up the inside of the filter. i just think of it as proof that it's really doing its job.it would have gotten five stars if culligan offered a recycling program for the used filters cartridges like brita does."
3,"Flow isn't great, but easy to use","Much easier than the new Brita sink attachment to switch to filtered water. Flow is a little too light, takes longer than desired..."
4,compact faucet filter,"This filter makes my water taste great. It is easy to mount and use. Sometimes the peg doesn't stay out while getting filtered water and I have to hold it out. It is smaller than another filter I used to have, so I like it better."
3,Won't work with a diverter faucet,"If you have a pull-out vegetable sprayer faucet, a diverter valve won't fit. You'll need to look at under sink water filters if you have a faucet with a pull-out sprayer. It's probably a great filter but it's of no use to me because it won't fit my faucet. If you have a detachable sprayer on your faucet DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!Unit works well at removing chlorine, great for pets & houseplants but it doesn't get out the rat poison (fluoride) so you may want to invest a little more if it's for drinking water."
4,"Aaaaaah, agua!","* Relatively cheap water filter.* Easy to install.* Design allows for actual filter to NOT get in the way when doing dishes.* Filtering water falls faster that pur's.* Water tastes...well, tasteless! =)Very Happy Here!"
2,Good for the first year ...,"This faucet filter was economical to use and it performed well for the first year or so (I purchased it in July of 2009) - and then the auto shut-off feature conked out. That wasn't a big deal for me, and it was worth maybe a star off my overall rating, but a couple of months ago it started to leak and drip unfiltered water into whatever I was trying to fill with filtered water. I recently replaced it with a PUR faucet filter (FM-3700B), which is a bit more expensive (for both the unit itself and the filter cartridges), but not overmuch, imo. If you're looking for the most cost-effective way to filter your water for maybe a year (and it does perform well when it works), this might be the way to go - otherwise, I'd advise considering a different product."
2,don't like it,"Consumer Reports rated it highly, saying it has a ""reminder"" for changing the filter. The reminder is a sticker to put on a calendar at the 3 month mark. Has nothing to do with usage, which means if you use it too often, you're drinking contaminated water before the change date....or changing it too often if you use it too little. In addition, the ""button"" which one pulls out to produce filtered water is supposed to pop back when the water turns off. That didn't last long...it simply sticks in place so that if one forgets to push it in, the first water out, even when it's not needed, is filtered water. And because the mechanical quality is so poor, it makes me suspicious about that which I can't see....the actual filtering."
2,Short Run,"Worked fine for 2 weeks, but then slowed to a trickle. Takes forever to get filtered water now. Capacity supposed to be 200 gallons or a couple months, so don't think we've gone through the filter. Hope I just got a bad one."
5,Great Product Culligan Faucet Mount Filter,"This product is easy to instal with no tools required. Works well but the only flaw is that it loosens itself too easily from the faucet so frequent tightening is required. Otherwise, it is a great value for the price."
4,Great easy to install filter,"Pro: Easy to install and use, relatively cheap, worksCon: filter does not last very long - about 2 months"
4,great choice,"After I bought this, it got rated number one in a leading consumer magazine. I can see why. Very easy to install and works perfectly. I can taste the difference in water weather drinking plain, or in tea, coffee, or powdered drinks. Not flashy but I am not terribly concerned about fashion for my kitchen sink. An excellent quality filter from a known brand in water. I do feel like the flow is a little slow--BUT--I live in the inner city and have low water pressure filter or not. That being said it does cope with the low pressure. By that I mean it always does flow, even if very slow."
1,114 seconds for 32oz...,"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to slow to use daily. As you can see from my headline, I finally timed it, and it took 114 seconds, more than a minute and a half to fill a 32oz bottle.In addition, the flavor isn't all that much better than before I bought it."
3,Not too bad,I added this to my Kitchen sink and I think that it is a good way to have good water. I did not realize that that pin on the side does not stay you have to pull it out either while the water is on or before for filtering.
3,Works Good,"This works good, the filters are a little difficult to change out and the automatic switch that used to change the filter back to full stream after you turned the faucet off stopped working after about a month. But all in all the filter still works well and water is better tasting. Which was all we were really going for."
4,Works as advertised,"Was delivered promptly and installed easily. It did reduce the flow rate of the faucet a little bit, but it's not bad. Water tastes a lot better than the regular tap water in our area of NJ."
2,Top cracked and leaked,"I bought this filter in Feb/2011, so its been almost 2 years. Even though it's a good filter and worked as expected, I am giving it 2 stars because of the following1) The top started to cracked soon after installation and finally it started to leak today2) Culligan does not honor 1 year warranty if you did not buy from them directly. I had an issue with the equipment two months after I bought it. When I had the issue I called Culligan and they flatly told me they would not honor the warranty since I did not buy from them directlyI guess its better than other filter out there in the market but not good enough"
5,So pleased with this filter,"This is the third type of water filter I've gotten for my kitchen sink. I've had two Purs and a Brita and they all broke. I've had this Culligan, which was the least expensive of the bunch, for quite awhile now and it's still working very well. It's affordable, replacement filters are affordable, and it holds up over time. I'll never buy the more expensive ones again!"
4,Very content with my purchase.,Before this product I had purchased a PUR water filter. It lasted about a day due to my home having a strong water pressure and the adapter for connecting the device to the faucet is made of plastic which immediately got shot out and thrown on the sink. Not accepting defeat to have filtered water in the home I went with the Culligan. Most important is the adapter is made of metal and once screwed on it stayed lock tight. Second the taste is great though im no water snob but for my quality bar it ranked very well above. Only con is it doesn't pivot for those large items you have to squeeze on the faucet but its a minor minus in an otherwise great product.
1,Terrible Product. Stay way!!!,"What a waste of money this is. After 2 weeks I got the ""drip"" (only drops). I figured hey, it might be because I needed to change the filter. I did that and same thing happened after 2 weeks (and the filter is supposed to last 2 months). I never had the faucet running all the way. By far the worst product I have ever bought at Amazon."
1,Wouldn't fit,"Bought this for college.. Really excited for it, and it wouldnt fit the faucet, so I returned it. Wasted some money for the college service for taking it to the UPS, and still havent been refunded yet."
1,Water tastes terrible,"I was using a Pur water pitcher for a few years and love how the water tastes from it. I hated refilling it and the space it took up in the fridge so I read reviews and this one sounded great! It was easy to put on the faucet. However, the water tastes like tap water and it's awful. I never realized what a difference my Pur water filter was to the tap until now. If I move the faucet at times water will break through and leak out. I have to turn the water off and manipulate it at least once everyday. I am going back to my Pur water filter. It was nice to have cold water on the spot too. I did not take that in consideration, or if my sink was full of dishes I couldn't get to the faucet. Sometimes good reviews does not always mean a great product. Anyone want to TAKE mine for free? That's how much it sucks!"
1,No difference,"I bought this water filter because it has so many good reviews.....i don't know why though. I installed it and it doesn't do anything, there's absolutely no difference in water taste with or without filter. Will be returning this crap."
2,OK - Not Great,"Tap water, it is not. Bottled water taste, it is not. Just OK. I suppose if I had it to do over again I would not buy this product."
1,Poor quality,This filter arrived cracked but my friend kept it. She called Culligan but they would not send a replacement.
1,broke after 2 months,Bought this in the middle of January and it is now April first a it is blowing water out the side. To late to return and no info on how to get Culligan to replace it.
2,Product Cracked after 2 hours use,"Purchased this thing, arrived next day. Love Amazon Prime :)Installed it, tasted great. An hour later went to use it and the plastic had cracked.Ordered a replacement with Amazon, will update my review when new unit arrives."
1,Casing cracked after eight months,"The filter generally worked well but the casing to the filter cracked after eight months of use. It's possible that, when inserting the filter, we stressed the plastic casing to some extent but the crack opened under water pressure alone. The return window expired six months ago."
2,"Very weak flow, dripping Good tasting water",I purchased this water filter for a tap in the home. Upon attachment I noticed that the flow was very weak but proceeded to fill a gallon over time. The water tasted and smelled great. However with additional use the flow just got worse to the point where no one in the house wanted to use it as it would take about 1 minute to fill an 8 oz cup. I have a Brita as well and the flow it much faster.I do not know if this is due to a faulty filter or just the way the mechanism is designed. Either way it's completely useless now.
5,"Easy to install, works great!","This filter was extremely easy to install, and does not leak at all! I love the fact that the filters are now available on Amazon and also qualify for subscribe & save! I'll never forget to have a fresh filter on hand now! I never realized how much taste and off-flavors were added to our tap water until we started using this filter! It's like night and day!"
2,Not too thrilled,"I purchased this filter less than a month ago. After a daily use of about average amount the flow of water is down to a trickle. It's time to buy a new filter. I really don't think the water filter should last for a less than a month for an average amount of use, specially one that costs that much.Considering switching to a new model."
2,Sprays all over,"In 2 months the area bewteen tap and filter started spraying all over the sink and counter. My husband replaced the rubber gasket, but the leaking and spraying did not stop. Waste of money"
2,stream of water too small,"I hope it's better quality than brita, but as far as i can tell this is a sad little stream of water and it takes up too much space in my sink. It makes it difficult for me to fill my water bottle and other containers. Overall, i think i'd take brita over this jus cause it fills a lot faster."
5,"Great water filter, coming from someone who used to only drink bottled water","For YEARS I hated the taste of tap water. Until I started using this water filter! It works just great- installation is very easy, and the water that comes out tastes great. I don't think I could differentiate this filtered water from bottled water in a taste test. I replace mine about every two months. My only complaint is that the unit is a *little* bulky, so that when you're washing large pots in the sink (for example, a crock pot) it does get in the way a little. But for the price, I think that's okay. A great product, I highly recommend it."
4,Better than the other leaky brands.,"I tried Pur and the leaking was terrible. I saw reviews that this product was better, and it is. I only wish it had a light to detect whenthe filter needed replacing. It is simple, less expensive and I've had no problems with leaking at all!"
4,Not last more than 4~5 years but best for the price,I have 4-unit apartment and have installed this filter since this product first came out from GE product - it's now Culligan brand and improved and last longer than GE. I have tried other brands but for the price and durability might be the best for now. I can rate 5-stars if it can last 10 years!! for now 4-star!!
5,Great Filter,"This filter far surpasses, the other filters at this price point. After 3-4 Pur filters cracked, each about 4 months after I purchased them, I decided to try something else. I gave this filter a try, and it has been nothing short of fantastic. It was easy to install, it is easy to use, and it doesn't leak. It is well designed so that there is little chance of it cracking. I highly recommend this filter if you are frustrated with what you have tried in the past and need a good reliable water filter."
1,Very inconvenient,"I have never been more disappointed with a product purchase. The adapter that Culligan provides does not even fit the faucet. For all the poor quality filters that Pur sells, at least Pur has the sense to provide more types of adapters. That ensures that the Pur filter can at least can be used post purchase. Not so with Culligan. For the lack of a silly adapter (which btw costs just a few cents), Culligan filters need to returned. The adapter should cost just a penny or two when bought on a massive scale. Yet, Culligan choose to not spend even that much for the sake of ensuring customers' convenience. That says a lot about how little Culligan cares about customer satisfaction."
4,"Not perfect, but better than the alternatives","I think Pur and Brita water tastes a bit better, but their build quality is horrid. The Culligan does an acceptable job of filtering water, and the device is durable. I've had mine for over a year with no problems."
1,not the solution,"i too have had problems with Brita & Pur filters, but i am confused why this item has gotten such great reviews as an alternative. i guess it just depends on your specific needs / what type of water problems you have.i felt that the Culligan filter did not filter much. if ""chlorine"" is your only issue, i suppose it will be helpful for you, but the water did not taste or even look filtered to me.i do appreciate the attachment part being made of metal, and the unit did not leak for me there; however, it did leak from the circumference of the filter unit itself, even though the filter was fully screwed into the housing unit.perhaps the most irritating of all was how SLOWLY the water comes through this filter. after about 1 week, it was barely a trickle with the faucet turned on at full volume.i'm moving on to yet another brand..."
3,"Easy to install, not much difference in taste.","After looking for faucet water filters, I went with the Culligan instead of a Brita or Pur because of the high reviews on Amazon. The installation was easy and works well so far. The downside is that it doesn't seem to taste that much different than my tap water and the water flow is fairly slow but not unbearable. I may try a Brita or Pur next because I prefer a more crisp and cleaner taste than what I'm currently getting."
4,Best Faucet Mounted Filter Under $20!,"Purchased this item to replace the PUR Faucet Filter. This Culligan filter surpasses the PUR model in design, filter life and ultimately water taste. Fits easy and securely to faucet No Leaks! Auto shutoff is very useful, good flow for a filter, Very satisfied with purchase, Only complaint is replacement filter costs nearly as much as entire unit. If price of replacement filter was more in the $5-8 range it would be perfect. And as usual Amazon rocks with lightning Shipping. You will not be disappointed with this unit."
2,"Culligan Faucet filter started ""spewing"" water after eight months of working.","It did a good job of filtering the water, though it slowed the water flow way down. Then when it was time to change the filter, the bottom piece was screwed on so tightly, I had to take the entire contraption off of the faucet and use a wrench to get if off. After another few months, it started spraying water from under the filter side. I'm going to try replacing the filter to see if that helps, but I'm ready to ditch this filter and try a different brand. Also, the ""filter life monitor"" is a sticker you put on your calender."
5,Great Water Filter,"I love this Culligan Faucet Filter. I had been using the Brita Aquaview but can't find them anymore. I think they are discontinued. I wanted a low profile, low tech filter and this Culligan fits the bill. It installed so quickly and it's much easier to use than the Brita."
4,So easy to install,"I spent a lot of time researching reviews on items before coming to a decision on this procuct. All the reviews i read are correct and it is easy to install, easy to change the filter, and easy to use."
5,"Good filtered water flow, easy install, good taste",The product has good water flow compared to Brita I've had before. The install was easy and most importantly it has a clean taste. Also the assemblage didn't leak.I would recommend to others.Only Con: Filter needs to be replaced every two months but that's not too impractical.
4,"reasonable price, reasonable performance","While i appreciate this unit's simplicity and affordability, we have had to replace the central unit twice in the last few years. It developed cracks in the top surface and sent a fine spray straight up into the air. It seems like other people have had this problem, too. Still, we bought another, partially because they're not prohibitively expensive, partially because we still had six replacement filters in our pantry..."
1,Sucks,"They work fine for the first week. Less and less water comes out until, by the end of the second week it's only a trickle, and days later it's only a few drops. I returned one and the replacement had the same problem. Not buying again."
2,NOT pleasantly surprised.,"Installed a new one about 3 weeks ago, after my last one cracked .Used the TSD water meter to test the water this morning.With this filter on I got 138ppm! without filter I got 110ppm, with the large bottle from Sam's club I got 88ppm and with polar spring bottle water I got 22ppm.So now I'm not so sure what does this filter do, it seems to add stuff in to the water :-/"
3,Can't Really Tell A Difference,"This is the first time I've bought a faucet water filter - I figured it's cheaper than getting a pitcher. My tap water's got a very strong metallic undertone and smells....I don't even know how to place the smell. It reminds me of paint.I've been using this filter for about 3 months. It does cut some of the metallic taste but it doesn't do so completely. Water still quite noticeably smells also.So I can notice a difference but the difference seems marginal. May try other another filter later down the line to see if results are any better. If your water doesn't need heavy filtering this probably does quite well, and I think you get your money's worth with it for the price."
3,Water filter,"Filter easy to install, preforms what it was designed to do. Only negative is that it cuts down on my water pressure. The\is because I have well water and the pressure in my tank isn't sufficient to give me a good flow of water. But, it serves the purpose that I bought it for."
4,"Good product, not much to complain about","Pros:-Water tastes much cleaner. I live in a part of the United States where we have hard water and no water softener. This filter makes the tap water from my kitchen sink taste a lot fresher and cleaner.-Easy to operate-PriceCons:-Water comes out slow. It flows out of the filter about 2/3 slower than it normally comes out of the faucet.-A little squirelley to install. Manual recommended a ""trial and error"" method of installing using a combination of gaskets and caps on your faucet. It took me about 15 minutes to find the right combination for my sink.Overall a good product, would recommend."
3,The best of a bad lot,"This is the best faucet filter of the group but that's not saying very much. They all are made with too much plastic and tend to break after a year or so and this is no exception. I've tried many brands of faucet mounted filters so I have some experience. (This is the third one of this model I've had.) The diverter valve on this model always stops working after about a month so and it no longer ""automatically"" turns off the filtering mode when you shut the water off. It's a disappointment, customer service is worthless and I suspect that faucet mounted filters is a nice idea but nobody has executed the idea very well yet."
3,Does not fit on faucet of friend I got it for.,Probably will work ok when I give it to my daughter for in her apt. It does not work on the person I purchased it for's faucet in his kitchen.
2,Bad water pressure,"I bought the Culligan Level 3 faucet filter. It was easy to install and use ,it just doesn't have the water pressure I like. I takes forever to fill up a gallon jar. This is an important feature for me. As for the taste, the water tastes fine I just want more pressure. When I used another brand, the pressure was great but I didn't like the taste of the product."
2,Filter leaks,I installed the filter but it leaks from under the valve that has to be pulled for filteration. The water sprayed all over. Looked like the filter was broken. I called culligan and they said there is a $134 charge for somebody coming over and looking at it. Else they asked me to call amazon itself!
1,"Not durable, no online support, no phone support","Tried this based on good reviews. Out of six filters used three failed within days (they just blow out of the mount, blow past the threads, will not stay in at all). One did this when first installed. Other three only last about 50 days each..no online support system. No phone support system..trying something else."
1,impossibly slow flow of water,"Received my filter and installed it OK, but to my horror the flow of filtered water is ridiculously slow and the flow of unfiltered water not much better, both are unacceptable. Have read other ratings that bear up my complaint. No more water filters unless they do not impede the stream of water, particulary the unfiltered. IT IS GOING BACK TO AMAZON THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING AND GOOD RIDDANCE!"
3,It works well,"The filter works well, but it doesn't filter everything. The water still doesn't taste great, but it is definitely better than regular tap water."
2,"Nice idea, but poor longevity","I bought this about a month ago because my apartment has lead pipes and this is one of the best values in filters certified to remove lead. The filter is activated by pulling a small metal knob. When you turn off the water, the filter is supposed to automatically deactivate itself. This feature broke within 2 weeks of use. It's annoying and more importantly increases the potential for damage to the filter when you forget that it's still switched on and run hot water through it (water over ~105 F will permanently damage the filter cartridge)."
1,Didn't fit my faucet,"The online manual suggests that this filter can be used with nearly any faucet. Well, that doesn't include mine -- and my kitchen faucet is a late model unit.Frustrating and disappointing. My faucet has external threads, and the Culligan FM-15A was simply too large for it. I have trouble believing that I'm alone."
1,"Price Pfister Don't fit, and water pressure is very slow.",Not only does this not fit Price Pfister but I had to purchase a new faucet because the back pressure caused my fixture to leak.I went and purchased a nice faucet (so much for saving money on my bottled water bill) but I get it home and it won't fit.I did get good customer service from Culligan who suggested I take both parts to the plumbing store and get an adapter on my own. So I'm sure I'll get it fixed.
4,Better than PUR,"I've owned the PUR faucet mount - in fact, I've owned 4 of them. I really liked the taste that the PUR filter produced but it is an incredibly poor design which constantly breaks. Well, I found this Culligan faucet mount and figured I'd give it a try. I have to say I'm very pleased with it. It's a much more robust design than the PUR model and it produces good tasting water. I live in the metro Detroit area which has very good water quality, so I cannot say how good it would work if it were to be used in a location with poor water quality. I can say that I am happy I made the switch to a superior product."
4,Good filter,"My boyfriend and I live in a city where the water is over chlorniated and this filter has helped tremendously with taste. I only gave this filter 4 stars because, we have to replace the filter cartidges sooner than it says to by about a month early. All in all it does get the chlorine taste and other hard minerals out of your water."
5,Cant complain at all worth the buy !!,"What can I say that the other positive reviews havent said so already, this is a wonderful product easy install ! and works like is supposed to. I have no complains other than In a couple of months will need to buy the replacement filter but thats expected with product such as this ! but in the long run this will save you a lot of money that you would have spent on BOTTLED water ! so is REALLY worth the purchase !"
1,Can't change the filter!,"I purchased this product after reading all the reviews. Now, when I am ready to change the filter, the filter will not come out! I called the company and all I was told is to soak it in vinegar to remove any mineral deposits. No luck! Soaked overnight! Have tried every way possible to get the filter to release without luck! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
2,Polypropylene filter a health hazard?,"Be aware that the filter is made of polypropylene, which is suspected to have its own health hazards. The same may be true of other brands (still looking), but thought the health-minded buyer should be aware.There is plenty of literature to raise this as a legitimate concern. If anyone can speak specifically to the use of polypro in water filters I would be interested in an informed opinion."
4,Filter The Faucet,"This is the mostest, rockinest, a**-kickin'est filter ever. OK, this is the ONLY filter I've ever bought, but it's pretty cool. All the other reviews were right. Installs in a jiffy, doesn't leak, and filters water, or at least I guess it does. I'm still alive, so that's gotta mean it's workin', right? A great product for the $ and I would purchase again. Oh, and it reminds me of the old ""Hey Culligan man"" commercials every time I use it which is a nifty little added bonus, for no extra charge!"
5,Great Filter!!!!,This filter does exactly what is expected. I am using it overseas and it does the job right. The first time you use it the product smokes a little it because all the chemicals inside are activated by the water moving through. Let the water run for a few minutes and basically enjoy. Easy fitment and easy to use.
2,Has Potential It Hasn't Hit,"I was initially very pleased with my purchase of this purifier, except for the lack of a 'time-to-change' indicator as mentioned by other reviewers. Unfortunately, that good feeling was short-lived. Two months into use, the pin that is supposed to automatically retract and turn off the filter after use stopped being automatic and stayed in place. We now have to push it in manually each time we use the filter. The water tastes fine -- the Culligan I used to know -- but the device needs improvement."
4,"In my opinion, Better Than Pur","I love this filter system. Super easy to install and it's well made.Filter can be a bit on the bulky side if you have a small-ish sink.What more can I say, buy the Culligan!"
4,"Compact, doesn't leak like a Pur/Brita","Being green-minded and clean-water minded, I've been through Brita, Pur, and now Culligan faucet filters. Brita is pricey and breaks. The Pur faucet filter lasted less than a year before leaking from at least five different spots, and the latest models are all ""one click"" and totally unusable on my faucet. After seeing the ratings on the Culligan, I decided to give it a try; I love the fact it's much smaller than the others, meaning my sink is more useable. It also automatically switches back to direct faucet flow when the water is shut off, and much, much easier to switch between direct flow and filter flow than the Pur. Plus, it's cheaper, and it looks like the filters will last much longer. We'll see how well it holds up, but I would've tried this sooner had local stores stocked it. Glad Amazon did."
3,"Doesn't leak, annoying to replace","I have tried other faucet filters (Brita) that leaked, so I really appreciated the metal-on-metal attachment which is sturdy and doesn't leak. HOWEVER, every time I had to replace the filter, it was a bit production as it would get thoroughly stuck in the housing. It was such a pain that I finally threw the whole thing in the trash. Back to a filter container in the fridge."
3,Problem Putting On New Filter Cartridge,"The order came within a reasonable amount of time. It's performance was up to par, and we enjoyed not having to carry and lug water jugs to and from the store to assure safe and cleandrinking water. However, when I ordered the new cartridge and tried to unscrew the old one, it would not come off. My husband tried, and even he could not unscrew it. I called Culliganvia the phone number listed on the back of the cartridge box, and they speedily sent us a new housing unit. It looked very different from the old one and did not have any Culligan logoon it. (Little did I care as long as it worked right, and it did.) I would just assume that if you buy this product and it comes time to get a replacement cartridge, allow yourself ampletime to receive the new housing if there is a problem. Other than this, it is an excellent water filter system and the water tastes great!"
2,Stopped working after 6 months,"I love the filter. The last replacement filter, however, is now stuck in the compartment. I can't get it out. Unless I find a solution, I'll have to buy another chamber."
3,There's no indicator,"This water filter does not let you know when it needs to be replaced, and so you need to write down when you install it. My water leaves a mark in my Keurig with this filtter, so I'm not even sure it's working at all,"
2,Water filter,"This is not a good filter. I really wanted it to be, due to the price, but I wasted my money. Its bulky on the faucet, the toggle quits working, so you have to manually switch it over, and it is just plain cheap. I respect Culligan and this was a nice try, but... I just got an Aquasana for 99.00 and LOVE it. Fast running, clean tasting, toggle works, it is great."
3,"Adds ""airy"" taste to water","Read all the reviews before buying this filter. I wasn't impressed. Installation was quick and easy, but the taste of the water was a bit chalky and ""airy""."
3,Useful Life,Is roughly maybe a year or more before the threads start strippng and leaking from replacing the filter about every 2 months.After recently purchasing a second filter and compared to other filters on the market this one is worth the price and quality.
3,Slow filter and lowers your water pressure,"The filter generally works but is fairly slow. I've been using it for about an month and it takes ~5 min to fill a liter bottle of city water. It was a bit faster when I first got it but not by much.The other annoyance is the filter significantly reduces my faucets water pressure, even when not in use. Essentially design of the filter forces all the water in the faucet through quarter inch hole. I had good pressure before installation with a 2.2 gpm aerator, now the water pressure definitely feels lower.On the plus side the filter feels solid and sturdy and there hasn't been any water leaks."
1,defective product,"The filter came once installed defective knob that allows water to pass filter travez arrived damaged and does not stand alone, the only way is to filter the water that constantly hold, not recommended."
1,leaks,"very dissappointed. at first worked ok, but when I tried to replace the filter, I could never stop it from leaking....too late to return it,"
4,Diverter plunger sticks,"This is a great filter for certain but, lately, the diverter (if that is the correct term) sticks in the filtered-water mode. Very frustrating to say the least. I would have given the unit a 5 star but I down-graded my rating because of this problem. Has anyone else encountered this issue and is there a fix?"
2,Water still tastes bad and had to buy adapter,"It hasn't changed the taste of my bad tasting water. The ""kit"" did not include the adapter I needed. I found one at Home Depot - another $4.00. My sink spout is smaller in diameter than the filter.On a positive note, it hasn't leaked and it does shut off by itself when you turn the water off.Without testing the water somehow, I have no idea what impurities are actually being reduced.I would not purchase this product again."
3,Below expectations,"I thought I did my research on this item, and knew what I was getting. But even though it works, it was easily installed and has no leaks, I am less than satisfied.The water is obviously not getting the filtering I would prefer, since my kettle still collects limescale and occasionally there are 'bits' floating in my ice water.The diverter valve does not automatically go back to faucet as promised, I always have to push button back in if I want the full pressure, unfiltered faucet.Other than that, not much to say. It was certainly priced right, and I got what I paid for. But I may yet go back to a filtered pitcher, it did a better job."
4,Nice Filter,The only problem I have been having with this faucet filter has been the leak around the gasket. So have to reseat the gasket every time it starts leaking.
3,Mostly works,"Filtering appears fine. Be sure to run water thru it for ~10 minutes per the instructions, to clear out carbon sediment. Be aware that even with the adapters, it will not fit all faucet spouts. In our kitchen we have several standard Delta faucets, one of which is a slightly smaller version in the bar sink - good thing, because this was the only faucet the adapters would fit. Also the flow is rather slow; that is caused in part because of being attached to the smaller spout which itself delivers less flow than the other faucets, but still the flow thru the filter is about half of what it is thru the spout.EDIT 12/15/12:After 2 yrs use, the filter housing is defective - it can no longer hold the pressure in the cartridge causing the cartridge to forcefully pop out of the housing. Quality level about what I expect these days, so I'll leave the rating at 3 stars."
2,What a mess!,"The water tasted fine but the installation was a nightmare and despite everything, the thing leaked relentlessly. Added to the fact that calling Culligan customer service gets you on hold until they shove you into a voicemail box and then never return your call made me take a fresh look at the Pur which took 10 minutes to install and that included the flushing process. No leaks and the water tastes as good as the Culligan. Giving the 2 stars because the water did taste okay and the thing was cheap."
4,flows well,This mount installed easily on kitchen faucet and the water flow is good through the filter. It is easy to operate. Replaces slower filling pitchers. My granddaughter likes the taste of the water too.
2,Broke after 1 month,Bought the filter and it broke after 1 month. Bought another filter thinking it was left on for a long time. Nope. Wasted money. Buy the more expensive for... $5 more!
4,Culligan FM - 15A Level 3 Faucet Filter,With water bottles gathering all over we felt there had to be a better way. Read reviews of several filters and decided to try the Culligan FM - 15A Level 3 Faucet Filter.No regrets. The faucet is easy to install and the button to turn it on and off lets us bypass the filter when using the faucet non-consumption chores.Water is crystal clear and tastes wonderful.Took off one star only because the filter device slows water flow in regular faucet and is very slow in filter mode. For $15 it is an excellent value.Culligan FM-15A Level 3 Faucet Filter
2,Culligan FM-15A,I couldn't get it to work. I hooked it up and the water would spray everywhere.Maybe if you have a newer faucet or plumbing experience you will have better luck.The refill cartridge is hard to pick out since the model numbers are almost the same-so make sure you are actually purchasing the right refill if you do get this to work.
3,works just okay,filter didn't last as long as i had hoped for as manufacturer claimed ... it stopped purifying water about 30 days after i got it .....
3,Good value and performance but difficult to change filters and unscrew,"I like the filter itself and the price, and the water tasted much better than straight from the faucet. However, I always had a lot of trouble getting the old filter out. The last time, I decided to remove the entire device from the faucet, thinking I might buy a new one and have better luck with changing the filter. However, I could not get the thing unscrewed from the faucet. I bought a pipe wrench, then a strap wrench - no luck (but much sweating and cursing). I finally had to call a strong-armed dude who was able to remove it. I'm not chancing all this hassle again. If they improve it so that there is an easy-grip way to remove the thing from the faucet, and an easier way to change the filters, then I'll be back."
3,not a good purchase,i read all the reviews and i found 5* rating for this......but the water is still salty even it is filtered through this filter....
3,clean water,"it works good, kind of bulky filter hanging off your faucet. It takes a long time for the water be filtered, you maybe there for a few min. filling up a pitcher."
3,Not impressed,"I *really* wanted this water filter to be good, but I am not impressed. It was easy to install and seems to be well made (thus the three star rating), but I can't tell a lot of difference in the filtered and unfiltered water.I will use it to water my plants and perhaps make coffee, but as for drinking water, I'm still looking for a filter that will give me that crisp clean taste."
1,Terrible Filter,"The water comes out in a trickle so I thought it was defective but when i called the company, I was told its the way its supposed to work. Its supposed to take 20-30 seconds to fill up an 8 oz cup! And soon after we got it, it got even slower."
5,"Easy to install, doesn't leak","After seeing the plastic attachments on other faucet-attached filters, decided to try this one. It has a metal attachment that replaces the aerator, and was easy to install. It comes with several adaptors to probably fit most faucets, and it has worked flawlessly for over 2 months. I really don't have a clue as to how well the filter works, but the water comes out clear and odor-free. The auto shut off when the faucet is turned off works perfectly. So far, an excellent product."
4,"Works well, replacements not readily available","After reading many horrible reviews on competitors, we chose the Culligan filter. So far, it has worked fine.*The water flow is really reduced after installation (not just when using the filter, but when it is switched off as well). I would suggest saving time by filling a large gallon bottle with filtered water all at once versus filling one glass at a time.*The switch on the filter that automatically (most of the time, anyway) shuts off once you have turned off the water is an asset.*The only complaint is in regards to replacement filters and costs. There is little supply for this, so one has to either shop around and find a local store that carries one (for a higher cost), which is a challenge- or plan ahead and order online.*In the end, the water quality is great. It really eliminates the chlorine and other unpleasant tastes from our city water."
3,Filter kept popping off faucet,"Installed relatively easily and then I, inadvertently, bumped it when I was turning the faucet from side to side. Just popped right off. Put it on again, did the same thing. Now I am just careful that I do not bump it because I had a devil of a time getting it back on. Does take the chlorine taste out of the water but I could fall asleep while waiting for a glass of water to fill up."
5,Clean water,"I'm pleased to have purchased this water system and threw out the old Pur. This filter is lightweight, easy to install, and I taste the difference with my water. The pur cheated me out of my money with the the faulty light installed. I think the change filter light came on like a week after I purchased it and the replacement filter was like $20 bucks! On top of that, I read reviews that the pur filter system claims were bogus and the filter didn't get all the chlorine and other remnants that we don't want added in our drinking water. The culligan system suggest changing the filter after so many gallons of water or 2-3 months. My pockets are happy and I like that my family is drinking clean water. Once you go culligan you'll never buy another filter again:-)"
3,"filter works fine, but faucet hardware is not great","I do not think you will regret buying this filter, for the price I think it is worth a shot, it does its job and cleans your water. But you will most likely be disappointed in the quality of the faucet mounting hardware and the functionality. The knob that activates the filter does not reset itself automatically very long before it gets rusty and gets stuck, it lasted only a few months. It can still be pulled and pushed but over time it gets more stiff and harder to work with. The plastic housing will wear out over time and crack. We are near the end of the life of our first one. We've had it about a year, it is just a $5 mount so no real gripe, but the top of it is showing a bulge and cracks when the water pressure is on."
5,Portable Dishwasher Compatible!,"I have a portable dishwasher that hooks up to the kitchen sink using a special aerator adapter.Most faucet water filters, require you to completely replace the aerator with a special attachment. This was not an option for me since it would have prevented me from using my dishwasher. So I was thrilled to discover that this filter would work with my dishwasher.You simply unscrew the aerator from the bottom of the faucet attachment (it's right below the pin that controls whether water flows through the filter) and replace it with the aerator adapter for the dishwasher!!Other thoughts:The sink filter is much more convenient than a pitcher filter.I would have preferred stainless steel to white plastic but I knew the color when I bought the filter.Installation was a bit time consuming but they included all the necessary parts."
3,It still cracked,"I installed this filter on our kitchen sink 4 months ago. After about 2 weeks the auto-off switch stopped turning off automatically, no big deal, we could push it in and pull it out. Things were fine, the water tested fine.I was waiting for a new cartridge to arrive from Amazon (literally the next day) when the current cartridge flew off into the sink and water sprayed everywhere. When I tried to install the new cartridge it did the same. Turns out the housing is cracked across the threads in two places and the cartridge won't stay threaded in.I switched to this after having several PUR filters fail after 6 months, but I guess it's just going to be something we have to plan on replacing as they fail. Replaced it with another PUR picked up at the local CVS."
2,does not last for 2 months,"I have no problem with the filtering system, but Culligan says it lasts for two months. Mine have lasted for one month. After one month you can still get water through the filter, but it trickels into a glass. It take a few minutes to fill a glass up. At $20 a filter (Costa Rica) I am not going to buy a filter every month."
1,Can not use it,I could NOT install it as it did not fit. User's manual tells you to go get an adapter from a plumber. Eh...
1,Culligan,This product sits in my hallway closet. I can't find any attachments that will fit with my modern looking faucet. It may work great on older type faucets. But not mine. Thank you for reading my review.
2,"Slight Leak, Auto Off Switch no Longer Works","This Culligan filters the water well, but after using it for 2-3 months, It developed a slight dripping leak from the side of the filter (only leaks while the filter is on). Changed the cartridge, no difference. Also, the button that turns the filter on/off no longer auto shuts off when the faucet is shut off, So you can end up using the filter more quickly if you are not proactive about the switch."
2,"Good water quality, but the normal water stream is far too small","I just bought a set of the product and fitted it with my faucet. The filtered water stream is very small which I can accept.But when I let the water flow the un-filtered stream, the water stream is same as the filtered one.I have to spend much longer time to wash my dishes. I checked the design, no way to change this, it is designed like that. Both stream use the same small whole to flow out.Eventually I have to dismount this filter from my faucet, really can't tolerate so ridiculously small water stream for washing dishes.How come nobody mention/complain this?"
2,filter lid glued on,"Seems a good product, attaches well, seems to filter. But when I wanted to replace the filter the filter cover would NOT come off...tried by hand, tried by pliers, tried by wrench... it is cemented. So I had to order a whole new unit.Is this the scam?I have respected the Culligan name, until now...made cheaply somewhere in the world for more profit."
1,"Trickle, Trickle","Followed directions,instalation easy,but cut water pressure in half on non-filtered, and was even worse when on filtered.Takes forever to just fill a glass, and to tell the truth I didn't taste much differance in the water. Would not recommend."
1,Useless after a week,"Spend your $16 on a weeks worth of bottled water instead of this. Water actually tastes worse after going through it. Someone in a previous review had a good tip: turn the water on to run slowly through the filter allowing it to properly pass through the charcoal and it will greatly improve the taste. The problem is, who has time to wait 20-30 seconds every time I need water.My advice, buy a proper under-sink filter and don't waste your money and time on this one."
4,Great for the money,"Pretty good and solid filter.Got it installed in under 5 minutes. I've been using it for 4 months now and have replaced 2 filters so far( takes less than a minute).Good water taste and filter never came off the faucet ( like some other filters do.)The only thing is that the filter does not turn off automatically sometimes now. I accidentally ran a hot water through it few times. Each filter starts running really slow after a 1-1.5 months. I'm guessing this is due to stuff building up inside.Other than that - water tastes great, and its much cheaper than bottle water."
4,Faucet Filter,"Great faucet filter, seems to filter better than the PUR faucet filter I had. It still doesnt get everything, but if i put it through one of those filter pitchers, it seems to do the job for the mostpart. There is still a slight bitter aftertaste from the Phoenix water."
4,"Low flow, no perceptible difference in taste","Recently I had my water tested and it was shown to be quite hard and cloudy. I purchased this faucet filter after having read decent reviews for it on Amazon as well as a recommendation by Consumer Reports. The filter was quick and easy to install. From previous reviews I was prepared for the low flow (can fill 8 oz glass in 10 seconds) and that is okay with me.My family and I conducted numerous blind taste tests and were unable to distinguish the filtered water from the tap on a consistent basis. Based on manufacturer claims regarding effective removal of minerals and contaminants, however, I have a greater peace of mind having purchased the filter."
2,Forget about the 5-year warrantee,"I was a satisfied user until one day when I couldn't get the darned thing open to replace the filter. I called Culligan and got passed around, finally leaving a voicemail.Corporate has no idea how to handle complaints, either. Those who will answer are used to expensive, permanent devices.Because time is also worth something, it is not cost effective to bother with ""support."" Maybe a pitcher system would be better: at least one can be sure to be able to replace the cartridge."
5,Great for my boat water system,"I've written a detailed magazine article on how to sanitize a boat's water system, and how long tap water is safe to drink after you've done that. As part of the process, I installed a Culligan faucet filter as the last step for good-tasting water. Extremely well-built. You can install it with your eyes closed. At first, the water flow (boats have much lower pressure than city water) seems awfully slow, but in our first over-nighter since the installation, it didn't seem slow at all. We're only using it for cooking, coffee, tea, etc. Great addition to the boat. Only drawback I see is having to estimate when 200 gallons have gone through it and it's time to change the filter. Declining taste quality may do that."
1,Does absolutely nothing,Tested my water quality with this before installing this product:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C0A7ZY/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00And it didn't improve the water quality 1 bit. Waste of money.
5,Culligan Faucet Filter REALLY works!,A great product. Our tap water is usually undrinkable. But with the Culligan Filter it tastes as good if not better then bottled water. Also VERY easy to install.
2,Filter doesnt last,This filter was easy to fix to the tap.However the filter system doesnt last long. Used it for less than a month and the water pressure from the filter has dropped drastically. Not durable and certainly doesnt last as long as it states it should!
1,Water tasted metallic.,Water tasted metallic. Twitter guy sent me to a distributor who couldn't help. Switched to Pur filter. All fine now.
4,Good Clean Water,"Shipping was fast, Setup was faster, gives a nice clean look and a clean crisp taste to the water. We had a little on the hard side of water and makes it taste quite a bit better."
4,Very good product,"This is a very good product. My only complaint is the relatively slow water flow. Ideally I'd like a bit more throughput, but considering this is a level 3 filter, I can understand why the water flow is slower than I would prefer. However, it absolutely does it's job very well - it vastly improves my tap water and installation was very easy. My faucet required an adapter which was included in the package."
3,Culligan Faucet Filter,"Looks good, clean appearance. Miss the chrome finish. Not thrilled with flow of water when in the filter cycle. However, it does the job, water definitely tastes better. Recommend future purchases."
2,"Same ol', same ol'","Most people get water filters unnecessarily, fearing contaminants that aren't really there. Although my water had some sulfate contamination, I couldn't detect a difference by filtering it. For someone who gets straight unpurified water from a well, a filter is a necessity, but for most tap waters, the filter is only a placebo benefit."
3,Bypass sticks,"After using this for about a month, the bypass sticks and now all water wants to go through the filter, unless you manually push it back in after every use."
4,"Easy to install, wish had more pressure.","Easy to install. Unfortunately the system brought the water pressure down such that I don't have high pressure water. Since I don't have a dishwasher this can be a problem. But besides that, loving it!"
4,Just what I wanted,"I bought two - one for me and another for my friend.Good things:1. Easy installation: I installed both the filters in under 3 minutes each2. Connects to any tap: Our taps were very different, but the installation was very smooth for both taps (product comes with several different tap connectors).3. Maintains tap height: It was important to me that the faucet height wouldn't be reduced by adding the filter. It wasn't!4. Automatic shut off: The filters I've used so far have had a knob that you've to turn both on and off. The Culligan comes with an automatic shut off mechanism that works based on water pressure. So I don't use the filter by accident when I turn on the hot water, for example. Great feature!Can be better:1. A ""change filter"" indicator would have been nice, but I guess I can tell when the taste changes.2. Sometimes the automatic filter gets stuck, but its not a very big deal. I just push the knob back in and that's that."
4,"Works great, wish it came with more adapters.","Purchased and used for the past month. Works as promised and water tastes clean and free of chlorine. Tested with a particulate meter (HM Digital TDS-EZ Water Quality TDS Tester, 0-9990 ppm Measurement Range , 1 ppm Resolution, +/- 3% Readout Accuracy available on Amazon as well).Only minor gripe was the it didn't include an adapter for my kitchen faucet which is recessed too far for the included adapters. When I went to local hardware store, I noticed about 30% of the kitchen faucets were also recessed. Culligan should've done more market research and included an adapter with a longer depth (the threads on the included ones were correct, they were just to short to fit my faucet)."
1,NOT GOOD..BUT IS THE PRODUCT NOT SELLERS FAULT.,JUST NOT SATISFIED...the stream comes out very slow and water does'nt taste any better. why buy it..i don't recommend it.
2,not a good product for water flow,I put this on my kitchen sink and the water flow was so slow that I had to remove it. the water barely trickled out and was so slow that it took 15 minutes to do something that was very a 10 second job. maybe I installed it wrong but its not for me.
3,Brilliant little filter - HOWEVER ...,"It lowers your water pressure. The water filtering is wonderful. It taste better than bottled water, install took 3 mins tops, and it looks sleek in your kitchen - so not a single complaints here regarding the filtering system.My only complaint:If you can stand low water pressure and I'm on the fence at the moment if its worth it ( doing dishes has turned into one gigantic frustration for me), most definitely look into getting this."
5,who needs bottled water now!,"Purchased this because the consumer reports reccomended it and it has been great the 3 wks I've had it. It was easy to assemble (I didnt have to buy any additional parts but in some reviews I saw people did) and works great, water tastes great."
1,It's Fine Until It Breaks Down on You...Twice!,"I suppose it's my own fault. Having purchased this filter in an effort to save money and based on the positive reviews, I was only a little surprised when the thing broke down after two-and-a-half months. Two weeks after putting a new filter in it, go figure. So, having this filter on hand, and faucet mounts costing almost as much as the filters themselves, I bought another one. That one lasted three-and-a-half months before breaking the exact same way (read: crack in the screw-treads where the filter locks in causing the filter to jettison into the sink and water to spew everywhere). Maybe I was just too invested because attaching the faucet mount was a David-Versus-Goliath-esque struggle (my old aerator had been rusted on, and took a solid hour of trial and error and a couple of embarassing/painful injuries to get the thing off). But I should have known just to walk away. This filter, she'll only break your heart."
4,Perfectly adequate,"The best feature of this little filter: it automatically converts from filtering to regular faucet streaming when you shut off the faucet. With our old Britta filter, I'd neglect to check to see if the faucet was set to ""normal"" or ""filter"" and would turn on the hot water to do dishes while it was set to filter, shortening the lifespan of the filter and generally annoying me."
3,No adaptor for my faucet,"I've used other brands of water filters on my faucet in the past that included the correct adaptor for my faucet. Unfortunately, this one does not. I don't know if the hassle of shopping for an adaptor is worth the lower cost or not. I do not yet know how well the filter works due to this problem."
2,cracked n broke when replacement filter was installed,"product worked great for a couple of months. first filter change, replacement popped out and broke. Amazon kindly sent another..same thing happened,,the filter housing cracked. Water tasted great, would replace the whole thing every 60 days if price was same as replacement filter. it was great while it worked.Culligan FM-15A Faucet Filter"
2,Only good for a few months,"I've had this faucet filter for half a year now. It was good for the first few months. About month 3 or 4 the button that activated the filter started sticking. Also, replacing the filter cartridges is a LOT more difficult that the directions say. I had to disconnect the filter and bring it to work and it still took 2 guys to get the filter out. I would not recommend this product."
3,"No frills, but doesn't leak.","I've had name brand filters leak on multiple tries, which is a little ridiculous. I've ended up going back to and staying with this one just because it doesn't leak. I'd rather have one with an indicator telling me when the filter needs changing but haven't found one that stays water tight.Also, this is fairly easy to install and simple to operate with no finicky habits. Works fine, but just want a feature or two more.UPDATE 6/17/12:Risked attempting another candidate that has an indicator light and found one that works great. Possible installation problems aside, the InstaPure F8CU-1ES Faucet Mount Water Filter System has worked great for me. Check its product page for my 5-star review:InstaPure F8CU-1ES Faucet Mount Water Filter System, Chrome"
4,Better than the pervious model,"I got this to replace a model FM-15 that I had for may years but was becoming lose internally and leaking water when used. Since it leaked into the sink, it was just annoying and not a big problem. However, the 15-A is even better. It has an automatic shutoff that pops closed when you turn off the water and a better design where the older model had leaked. I look forward to many years of trouble free filtering at the exceptional levels that only an activated charcoal filter can provide."
1,Will not install on many faucets (read other reviews too),"I wish I had read some of the 1 star reviews too. This might be a great product IF it could be installed. My faucet is a regular type which can switch between 1 large stream vs many small sprays. This makes it slightly wider than the bare-bones ""pipe like"" faucet ends. However, despite being only slightly wide at the watering end, this filter will not fit on my faucet - the filter housing conflicts with the faucet neck. I went to home depot and Aces hardware - nobody carried any adaptors that would help my situation. Culligan, please keep more horizontal distance between the faucet attaching site and the filter housing to accomodate wider faucets.So in summary, it looks like a great filter in theory but it won't fit. I'm returning it in under 2 hours."
3,Lasted about a year,"This filter got rid of all the particulates and taste in my tap water. For 15 dollars (what it was when I paid for it) plus a filter every month I got a great deal. But unfortunately towards the end of the year there were large cracks coming from the center of the top. Every time I pulled the tab to filter the water the cracks would expand ever so slightly, it worried me so much that I just threw it away. I bought this model over any other so I could avoid that. Otherwise, it's a great filter."
3,Simple & convenient but not the best taste,"This is a tiny filter that's super-easy to install and use, and doesn't get in the way of using your faucet for washing dishes, etc. I like that its default mode is unfiltered - the filter toggle is held on by water pressure, so when you turn off the tap, the filter turns off too - this means you don't end up using filtered water when you don't need to. However, the taste of the water is really not as nice as the previous Pur filter I used."
3,Just Okay,"I was a Pur filter customer. That's all I bought and suggested that other folks seeking to invest in a faucet filter buy. However, after going through about three or four Pur filter mounts, I decided it was time to try something new. So, I started doing some research on the internet about which faucet filter aside from Pur or Brita, was best. I came here to Amazon.com and saw that this particular filter by Culligan got some good reviews. Thus, I purchased and received the Culligan faucet filter about a month and a half ago. While I really do like the design of the filter mount and feel it's durable, I don't care for the taste of the water. It does seem to filter out a lot of the ""stuff"" in tap water, and the filtering process definitely makes the water look clear, but again, the taste is not winning me over at all. So, after the filter runs out, I'll be going back to Pur. I know the Pur design is not really that durable, but the water is the best I've ever tasted."
5,Great product,this is the best filter I have ever had I would recommend this to anyone interested in purchasing a product like this money well spent
3,"Easy install, average taste","I bought this after my Pur filter broke. This filter was easy to install on my sink, and I was able to do it all by hand. The only downside was that the filtered water tasted about the same as the tap water, and was not as good as the Pur filtered water. The mechanism for redirecting the water to/from the filter to the tap faucet is neat."
4,Culligan water filter,"this was a Christmas gift for my daughter and her hubby. They really like it a lot.I received it it plenty of time before Christmas. No complaints what so ever.Thank you ,Betty"
1,Cheap,Leaking and dripping in less than a year of use. wish it was better quality. It has good taste though
1,No customer service!,"This unit worked well for a few months, after which it developed a dripping problem. I was certain that there was an easy fix for this, so I tried to contact support. Over two weeks, I made three attempts to contact customer service at their customer service email address. No acknowledgement email; no response. I then tried their 800 number, but was on hold ""for the next available agent"" for over 30 minutes. I gave up.If you have any trouble with this unit, Buyer Beware!"
4,pure water,"the filter was very easy to install and they give you several faucet adapters, but the one fit my faucet without a problem the only drawback is it takes about 2 minutes for a gallon of water and when you just use the faucet without the filter it is even slower than without the filter on the faucet"
2,"Junk, it only works for like 2 weeks.","I thought this little thing was great when I first installed it. Quick and easy installation and the water comes out flowing just fine. However after 2 weeks the water only some of the water drips out and I have no clue what happens to the rest of the water. This thing may be cheap, but it will certainly raise your WATER BILL. Don't buy, it is pure junk. The price tag does not justify the crap that this is because it will take you forever to fill a cup and all the water you use will not go into the cup, I think it stays inside of that dumb filter. It's a waste."
1,"Terrible filter, doesn't purify water at all","I bought the tool from walmart to check if the water is really purified by this filter and how much it is purified. The ironic thing is at first the water turns to be more ""dirty"" after it is purified. Don't listen to the business person say it is because of carbon, it's not, after one month, the ""dirty"" filter is washed out and the water shows completely same quality before and after filtration!!! I can't bear this. Don't buy this."
1,Don't buy - piece of junk,I did exactly what is written in the installation guide... but the stem/valve didn't work at all. I had to hold my hand once i need filtered water... it will not be held automatically even with the right water pressure.... the valve/stem is rubbish.... I advise you not to buy it.
1,SUPER SLOW FLOW!!,"I love the idea of cleaner, better tasting water, but I just removed this filter from my faucet. The flow is SO SLOW, that it takes about 6 minutes to fill a 64oz pitcher. I even tried changing the filter to make sure the first one wasn't defective. I would not recommend this product."
2,the product keeps falling down,Used the product for 2 weeks and then it couldn't stay on the facet and kept falling down. so I had to stop using it.
1,This Filter doesn't do anything,"This filter is completely worthless. I tested it with a water quality tester, and it didn't change anything. Not only that, but the instructions require you to run your water through the filter for 10 whole minutes before you can even start using it. Who wants to do that? Talk about a waste! I'd save your money and not buy this piece of junk."
3,Haven't Used,I bought a new sink and faucet so this will not work for me now. Plan on giving it as a donation.
2,You get what you pay for,It was not rated by Consumer Reports but I decided to buy it anyway because of the $25+ price and I was tired of hauling the 3 gallon bottles of Glacier water (20 centper gallon at the grocery store vending machine) up to my 2nd floor apartment. My ice cubes used to be clear but now they are cloudy. The water is ok in my morning coffee (battery acid probably would be too). I still buy the Glacier water (though less) for that cold glass of ice water that I take to bed every night. You get what you pay for.
1,want fit every faucet,i waited for this filter in got it homw and it wouldnt even fit at all. none of the attachments would make it fit either so i return it
3,it is ok for the money,Filter is still working but the button dsnt go back in after I shut the water off.You have to push it to use the faucet only.The taste of the water isnt as good as Brita's
2,Works great until it breaks. No customer service - warranty not honored,"I bought this water filter almost a year ago. It worked fine and our horrible tasting tap water was made drinkable.After about 3 months, the metal pull switch to change between faucet water and filter water started to stick. Then, even though I changed the filter cartridge per the recommended schedule, the housing cracked open after about 10 months of use. Culligan may have a 2 year warranty, but good luck reaching them. Their phone numbers (1 from the box, 1 from the instructions, and 2 from Amazon customer service) all go straight to voicemail, and they never returned any of my calls. Amazon should remove the 2 year warranty information from the product description."
2,Doesn't Fit my Moen Faucet,"I have no idea if this product works or not. This Culligan faucet filter does NOT fit my Moen Faucet, so I'm returning. My faucet isn't fancy, it's just a regular faucet. I'm disappointed.Thankfully Amazon has a wonderful return policy!"
2,Had to replace 2 filters in more than 2 years,I don't have any complaint about the water quality from filter ... i guess it should be good but I had to replace 2 units in 2 years or so. First one did not got jammed with the cartridge and i discovered this once it was time to replace the cartridge. Nothing worked to unscrew the cartridge.On my second unit the pull out plug got lose and comes out once in a while when you use it. Also the top of holder developed crack in less than a year due to water pressure.I guess it could be well constructed to avoid these kind of issues.
4,Works,What I do like.It turns itself off after each use.It holds up and doesn't break.It is better priced than Purr or Brita.It Holds up better than Purr or Brita.What I don't like.It doesn't have a LED indicator to change the filter.It doesn't quit when it's time to change the filter.I have had several of all 3 Faucet Filters and Culligan is the best made and best priced. Purr and Brita break before I have replaced 3 filters. They just don't hold up. Culligan does.
2,Was not very satisfied.,It was easy to attach to the faucet but it leaks and continually comes unscrewed from the faucet. I would not repurchase.
2,A Disappointment,"Although there is nothing wrong with the information in this book, or the writing, it is basically just a full book about ""why"" to have writing workshops, what the benefits are, etc and very little concrete information about ""how"" to set up writing workshops. This would be a fine book for a teacher training class to start a conversation about the purposes of writing workshops, but it did nothing for me. I was wanting some help in beginning a writer's workshop in my classroom but I learned nothing new."
1,For absolute beginners,"This book could easily have been called 'How to swap out modules in a computer monitor'. It is aimed at too low a level to be of any use to anyone seriously interested in troubleshooting a faulty monitor on their own. Whenever any serious 'troubleshooting' is required, the author simply says ' substitute a know working module' . Yeah!!, like we all have lots of them lying around. If you've got a faulty monitor and you dont know where to start looking for the problem you'd be better off putting the cost of this book towards getting it repaired professionally. Just my opinion for what its worth."
2,Disappointed,"The book is shallow, lacks comprehensive cover of monitors other than the one used as an example (an old Tandy). The quality of printing is particularly poor with the circuit diagrams almost impossible to read. It left me frustrated that it promised so much (Troubleshooting & Repairing etc.) but delivered so little.Look elsewhere guys."
5,A very comprehensive collection of detail and information,"This book easily summarizes information which can take years to obtain from other sources. It is very well written with an excellent structure for quick reference. The book covers essential safety tips, basic video theory, CRT monitors, and flat panel displays. The illustrations and tables are appropriate and easy to understand. A troubleshooting section is also included for later reference. This book is well suited for both individuals and the classroom"
3,BRAUN KFK4 Replacement Carafe,"I hate glass coffee carafes.Sooner or later you will somehow manage to crack them.I recently purchased a coffee maker with a metal carafe, and I love it!I bang it on anything and everything and it keeps on going."
5,pocket watch,"This product came on time, it was reasonably priced. It was packaged nicely. It is beautiful and we were very pleased and we would recommend this pocket watch."
3,aight,"it came with no instructions but it did come with a drum key. it had a different beater head than its picture suggested but the one it came with did the job pretty good. it had a really hard rubber texture. so it had a nice thick ""thump"" sound to my bass drum. but in my house i'll probably just take the fluffy textured beater from my old pedal and put that on this kicker instead for now until my band does a show. but i replaced my dis-functional bass pedal with a much better, more durable and sturdier one. so i am happy."
4,soothing,"I listen to these beautiful songs while I work, and find that I can shut out the world. Soothing and beautiful."
3,"Nice, but not as nice as part 1 and 2","When I found out that there was a third part of State of Grace - long after I bought parts 1 and 2, years ago- I had to buy it.Now that I have listened this CD several times, it does what it has to do, like the first two parts, but I miss the small jewels that were to be found on the other CD's. I understand niw why this is the final part of State of Grace for Paul Schwartz.The CD opens beautifully with Christe Redemptor, which is to me the best song on the album. The other songs are not bad.Still: no regrets I bought this CD!"
1,Why so many glory holes?,I was expecting a movie about the Hollywood Elite. What I got was 83 minutes of hidden cameras on Glory Holes in Hollywood Rest stops.
1,Utter Garbage,"I watched this movie on recommendation from a friend. This man just spills out junk. I feel terrible for the honest celebrity's that were given the chance to star in this movie. If it was actually a popular movie it would probably ruin their careers. Save your time and money, an avoid this like the plague."
1,94 minutes you'll never get back,"This movie is a complete waste of a ranking space on Amazon. I highly recommend buying Anus Magillicutty instead of this movie.From a self professed Kohen and ""King of the Jews"", Halperin presents himself in a rather blasphemous role while posing as a gay actor looking for work in Hollywood. Instead of an insightful look at the workings of Hollywood, Halperin turned this potential into 94 minutes of absolute crap.His sexuality has since been questioned and it's very likely that this piece of work will be looked back upon as his first step towards admitting his homosexuality.If you enjoy touching movie moments, don't bother getting this movie. The only ""touching movie moments"" that you'll see are of Halperin touching himself."
1,Will Induce Vomiting,"This film, if it can even be called that, is the worst piece of filth I have ever had the displeasure of watching. Ian Halperin should be strung up and shot for creating this monstrosity. Google it."
1,destined for glory,"While ostensibly a farce, this semi-autobiographical film examines the struggles of a deeply troubled gay man and talentless would-be actor, who takes on all comers in a desperate attempt to make a name for himself in Hollywood. As a story of sexual angst and leather-clad release, it has been compared to the classic German film ""Taxi Zum Klo."" It is also the story of Halperin's long journey to overcome self-loathing over his Jewish heritage. Ian's dream world is dominated by an SS officer named Anton, who tortures him at will, while refusing his sexual advances. I won't give away the ending, but suffice to say that redemption occurs with an explosive finish, and yes, a saxophone is involved."
1,i never got my order,I ordered this video months ago and never got my order...i hope someone contacts me and tells me what happened or give back my money.
4,While the credits role!!!!,I'm not at all sure what he is saying but I am really feeling this song I just got finished watching the movie and have rewinded it just to listen to this spanish song don't know what it is yet...but someone let me know....and whis singing it....Thanks
5,The CD Soundtrack of 2004 to OWN!,"Rarely if ever does a compilation rise to the level of Collateral. Most soundtracks are just a few hits tossed together hoping that one of the artists may attract you. This is the CD that takes you places. Collateral is a very powerful and moving collection that can be appreciated easily by both the novice and the expect. Practically ever genre is covered. Every song, no matter what your personal preference, forces you to listen and go along for the ride. This is the CD that will impress your friends as well as that first date. Collateral can be that special gift when you want to make a real impression. Or just tell them that it is a compilation that you made. Drop a few names of the artists to reflect your new worldliness. I won't tell."
4,Remember 'Miami Vice'?,"This was a great soundtrack as it perfectly evokes the up-all-night feel of the movie. Its breadth of artists--Audioslave, Groove Armada and Miles Davis, for instance--all fit the mood in different ways. I used to work a job where I got off at 1 AM and would flip through the dials for different sounds on the way home. Same vibe here.And when I heard a song called ""Rollin' Crumblin"" I couldn't help but think of the first time I saw the episode of Miami Vice with Phil Collins' ""In the Air Tonight"" (yeah, I'm that old).Great movie; well-done soundtrack/score; a little skimpy with the tunes (at 52 minutes, could have gotten a few more good songs on here)."
4,Tracks not included,"This was a good soundtrack, but there were a couple of tracks that were not included on the release. When Tom Cruise's is leaving the jazz club, the track playing is the ""Heat"" soundtrack, entitled ""Steel Cello Lament"". Also, the track playing when the FBI agents are loading up and preparing to get Max is from the soundtrack, ""1492"", entitled ""Moxica and the Horse"". Just thought I would drop a line for anyone that was interested in knowing. I thought it was a really good movie."
3,Do you want eclectic?,"I heard a great Korean tune in the scene shot inside the Korean disco, I heard great soul music in the taxi and there really was not a scene in the movie that did not have an excellently matched piece of music to accompany it. Like the movie, which visually surveyed the Los Angeles physical landscape, the soundtrack includes music that evokes the many different cultures and atmospheres of Los Angeles."
3,Is there a score album coming?,"I hope there will be a score album. Although all the pieces in this album are quite nice, I want to hear more James Newton Howard music. Especially at the end there was very nice percussive music and only 2 minutes of it is presented in the album."
3,works but not easty,It does technically fit my 2008 Sienna but the rubber lip is thicker than the paper OEM item making the replacement of the housing cover difficult.TIP: disconnect the vacuum tubes prior to removing the housing cover to avoid breaking them.
3,Very flimsy,This filter is very light-weight and flimsy. It does not seem to be near the quality of the Toyota filter that came with the vehicle.
5,Troublesome Twins,"This is the seventh in the Mary Ann series and fans will not be disappointed. There are two Mary Anns now.. Mary Ann has twins, David and Rose Mary and Rose Mary at six is just like Mary Ann was at age eight. So now we have double the delight and double the trouble!David, however, chooses to be a mute child. Is it because his sister speaks for him all the time? Mary Ann's husband thinks so. As he and Mary Ann disagree on the issue, situations arise that cause a major blow up and Mary Ann walks out.Are Mary Ann and Corny over almost as soon as they began? Who will admit they are in the wrong? I found this to be a great tale about marriage and meeting your spouse halfway. Sometimes, as this story shows, one must swallow their pride.."
5,I am a Catherine Cookson fan,I absolutely love all of Catherine Cookson's books. I don't know what I am going to do when I have read them all. The best storyteller around.
2,Thumbs down,"I read Judd's other book (Boone)about early frontiersman Daniel Boone and liked it so much i ran out and grabbed a copy of Crockett as soon as i could get my hands on it. I expected a similar tale of long hunting and trapping excursions, encounters with Indians, and an overall historical/fiction representation of this great outdoorsman's life. Unfortunately, as I read on, the main emphasis was more on Crockett's political ties and town life.Might have been a good history lesson for some but sure wasn't what I was looking for. I had to put it down. Get Boone if you can find it. It's a much better book."
4,Earthy Precursor to Rusted Root,"This debut CD by a band now known (I believe) only as ""Garden"" was a strong first effort, with an earthy combination of acoustic instruments and co-ed vocal harmonies that pre-saged more recent acts like Rusted Root. Nothing on ""Garden Variety"" is quite as hard-driving as Rusted Root's ""Drum Trip/Ecstasy,"" but certainly the percussion is similar on the opening track, ""Here and Now.""The strings also work very well here; rather than as ambient orchestration, they're used as a second or third instrumental melody, much the same way that 10,000 Maniacs did on their ""Unplugged"" CD.I've never had the pleasure of seeing Garden Variety live, but this CD was good enough to make me wonder if they're coming my way anytime soon."
3,review for heater,"It heats very well for a small room, and I guess it is not designed for a hall or a large room. The thermostat is not working great; which it results to more period of being on and more power consumption."
4,Nice Heater,This is a nice heater for small rooms and for under desks in cubicles. Works well. I would like to have more on options but the high/low setting and multiple fan settings provide enough regulation of heat for all but the coldest places.
3,mixed experience,"I bought this header a couple years ago and use it constantly as a fan in summer and heater in the winter. Overall I like it -- works well, not very noisy, stable design. Recently, it started failing to shut off when I turn it off. I have to unplug it, which isn't that difficult, but now I'm leery of the failsafe, which is one of the features I was interested in since I have a cat and the heater could possibly be tipped over. Still using it though, I just took it to work where my cat does not go."
4,Very safe,"I bought this heater a few weeks ago for my cubical at work. It does a pretty good job - it warms me up when it is sitting under my desk, but if you are more than 4 feet or so from it you will not be able to feel the warm air. Last friday I accidently left the heater turned on when I went home. When I came to work monday, it was still working perfectly fine, no damage to it or to the building (fire is bad!). I would buy this heater again."
4,Works Great But Fan Won't Shut Off,"This is a great unit, especially for the price. However, it just started malfunctioning (used for 2 months) and now the fan will not shut off unless you unplug the unit. It sounds like the thermostat switch has gone bad. Still heats great though -- you just now have to ALWAYS unplug the unit, otherwise the fan keeps running. No response as of yet from Delonghi and the store where I purchased it will not exchange it as it's beyond their 30-day time period for exchanges."
4,Wonderful Heater HOWEVER . . .,"We have this heater in the middle bedroom where it gets cold. It heats wonderful; especially with keeping the door shut. However, our electric bill almost doubled due to this wonderful heater."
5,Perfect to heat or cool down my cube at work,AC can be very cold or hot at work. I use both the fan and heating functions. It does the work well and it is much less noisy than the previous ones i owned (different brand)
1,DeLonghi SafeHeat Fan heater,"It sure was a bargain, but it does not work as it should. The on/off switch does not turn off when trying to turn it off, so I have to yank the plug off the wall in order to turn it off.I guess you get what you pay for (price was $14.99 + tax). I should have bought something a little more expensive, but working correctly. I do not want to spend money to return the item to get a refund, so I'm just gonna have to keep it.I would not recommend anyone to buy this item. I first thought it was made in China like all cheap stuff, but to my surprise it was made in 'Canada'!"
1,Terrible product stay away,"I bought two of these heaters, and they have barely been used for 2 months, on one of them the thermostat does not work anymore. The fan just runs and runs, and on another, it is very loud with metallic sounds.. which can become quiet annoying. Their warranty is not worth having since you have to get it to their warranty station and if you don't live near one, you are screwed.I would go ahead and spend more for a better unit.."
5,Great buy on a great heater,This little heater was bought to replace a heater 3 times its size & it puts out more heat! Would recommend it to anyone.
4,Nice but not safe,"This heater works very well for its size. However, it does not turn off if it is turned over. It claims to do that, but doesn't. Luckily, my cat jumps well over the heater so nothing is likely to tip it. I especially like the ""42 degree"" setting, which makes it automatically turn on if the temperature gets that low. I heat with wood, and this is my backup for the bedroom, which occasionally does get that cold. I don't notice if I'm asleep because of my electric blanket."
1,awful,"like everyone else said, this heater constantly shuts off and won't turn back on for a good 10 min. it's a piece of crap, do NOT waste your money."
1,Doesn't stay on,"Bought this 'cause of all the good reviews. After owning it, I've returned to look at all the bad reviews and have to agree. The heater shuts off after only a few minutes on time. I have to turn both knobs to their lowest settings and back up again to get it to turn back on. All the while the red ""On"" lite remains on. Can't recomend this for anyone trying to add heat to a cold room."
3,"Excellent heater, until it turns itself off","The heater does its job well. We've been transferring it from room to room, and it is complementary to our central heating.Unfortunately, it has a tendency to shut itself off, especially when used in small spaces (like the bathroom or the kitchen). We assume it's some sort of protection from overheating mechanism, but it's still quite annoying, and limits our use to large rooms."
2,Time for a different model,"This is small and inexpensive and it's lasted (sort of) for 2 years, and those are its only virtues. I've been unhappy with this thing since I bought it. There are only 3 temperature settings (off/1/2), so the user has very little control over the temperature. Supposedly there are 6 levels/settings for the fan, but they've never worked for me; I only get OFF and ON. The thermostat is automated and very flaky. It can be below 60 in my office, and the heating element won't trigger. My office thermostat reads 61 right now (I'm freezing!) and I cannot get it to click on. These are not new problems; I've experienced them since I bought it 2 years ago. I'm going to replace it with a different brand/model that allows the user to control the temperature and fan setting."
2,"Good looking, good price but desposable...","I bought two of this fan heaters, at the beginning they were working great, but a month later one died, wouldn't even work as a fan, and the other, after six months, I can only set it to run in low power, since in high turns itself off after two minutes, very disappointed, I'd go for something a little bit more expensive but long-lasting."
2,Constantly flips circuit breakers,"This heats up a small room really quickly, but I would advise that it be the only thing on a circuit breaker in an older house. It constantly flipped my breakers, so isn't of any use to me. I'm returning the product."
2,Works okay but not always,"I bought this product late 2008 for office where the temperature is too low for me. I like it...when it's working. Some days the heater just wouldn't work. I would unplug it for half an hour then plug it back again. Sometimes that resolves the problem but most times it doesn't. Also, it doesn't have a switch to turn it off so it must be unplugged after use for safety reason."
2,No Longevity,"I purchased this space heater September 10,2008 and it has already died! It was good while it lasted, but it checked out a few weeks ago just shy of my having it a year. I will definitely be trying a different brand this time."
1,Not Impressed,We bout this heater for our bathroom to heat it upwhen we are taking showers. the problem is it turns off from over heating or it hits its thermistate before you are half way done with your shower so when you get out it is still cold
1,This heater would not heat!,"DeLonghi DFH132 SafeHeat Fan HeaterThis heater didnot work, it was defective I'm wondering if it had been returned and Amazon put it back in stock and filled another order with it. This is the second heater I purchased from Amazon that was defective. The first one was a Soleus radiant heater, it caught on fire after being use about 3 months. I have a small heater I bought from Target 2 yrs ago for $7.50, it works just fine. I'm disabled and needed a good heater to keep near my chair. I am not buying anymore heaters from Amazon I think they may be getting defective merchandise from suppliers. In fact I will limit my shopping from Amazon from now on. It is just too much trouble to deal with sending things back and waiting for their customerservice to get a refund. I gave it one star only because it looks good!!"
2,Lowest end heater,"This is the simplest space heater I've ever owned or maybe seen. I'm not sure when I turn it on what I'm temp. I'm turning it on for. It heats a very small area. It works, but minimally."
3,Delongi space heater,"keeps cycling off even when turned to the highest setting, guess is a safety feature, but still leaves area cold at times before cycling on again. Probably needed a stronger one even though we wanted something safe and small.I don't understand why it cycles off when the area is still pretty cold. Still, it is really the only one that would fit safely where we are using it."
2,Fan Rattles,"worked great for the first couple weeks, was very quiet and heated well. It may just be the unit i received, but just recently i turned it on and the fan is rattling to the point where it is annoying to even have on. the unit has never been knocked over or even moved for that matter, so I dont understand whats goin on exactly, but i would consider it a manufacturing flaw that just presented itself. i would return it for an exchange but the time it'd take for me to ship it back isnt worth the 15 dollar price tag. if it wasnt for this i'd give it 5 stars, but I would go for a more quality unit that is less likely to have problems a few months down the road."
4,small heater,"This is a nice little heater. I purchased it after reading some positive reviews. It works well for a small space. It has a thermostat that is adjustable, but at times even on the highest setting the heater cuts off too soon. All in all it is a fine product for the price, highly recommended."
3,Warm but incovenient,"I got this for my husbands cold home office for Xmas. It's very warm and works well when he turns it on - but there isn't an on-off switch, and this seems to be very inconvenient for him, so he often doesn't turn it on. If I was to do it again, I'd buy a heater with an on-off switch instead."
3,Getting the job done,"This space heater is perfect for homes with small children. It is cool to the touch and easy to operate. It is keeping our bedrooms warm which are directly over our unheated garage of our cap cod home. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is the contols. They are hard to see and are not intuitive. You will need to have a light on and be directly in front of the unit to know exactly which setting you are choosing. A small gripe but a important feature that must be considered if you have poor eye sight. You cant go wrong with a DeLonghi from my experience. For the money, its a good bargain and useful product."
2,You get what you pay for. . .,"I'm a review reader and had second thoughts before buying this heater. A lot of the reviews said the heater wasn't very strong and the knobs weren't clearly marked. I figured people were just trying to use it to heat a large room and maybe didn't read the directions about the control knobs. I was wrong!! We have a very small bathroom and this heater does not warm it up. If you stand within 2 feet of it, you can feel heat otherwise it's worthless. I set it so that it will keep the room as warm as possible and the heater still shuts off after just a few minutes. The controls are very poorly marked and the directions could be clearer. If you are looking for something to place at your feet and keep them warm, then this is a good value. If you want something to warm a small room, I would suggest looking at another product."
1,Very disappointing,"This heater shuts off and on. It is in the ""off"" mode for longer span of time than in the ""on"" mode. Would have preferred knowing this since I wanted continuous heat. It was not cost effective to ship back."
4,over 3 years and still warm,"I bought this heater 3 years ago and it still works wonders during the cold winter. It's quiet and compact, and even after running all night the knobs are cool to the touch and the system itself is only slightly warm. The heat adjuster is sometimes difficult to find that perfect temperature you want but other than that I find no complaint with the system."
1,It just doesn't work,"The heater works for 1 minute, and just stops. There's probably something wrong with the thermostat. So it's completely useless. So I bought a different fan heater, and the new one is terrific (Lasko 5367 16-1/2-Inch Oscillating Ceramic Tower Heater)."
3,It's ok,"This fan works great 20% of the time. It has only two options, heat and no heat. It also has only one fan speed, on. This thing is working one second, off the next, then never comes back on. All I needed it for was my cube (I work in a cold office and get cold easily I guess) it is literally at my feet all day and it still cant do the job. The multiple settings are a complete joke. Believe me when I say this, there's only one speed and only one temperature setting. On or off. If you do want it on good luck, it turns itself off DAILY and wont work for no reason.Edit: it's now years later and the heater still heats. Still not perfect but for what I paid I'm surprised its still working, it still takes messing with the nobs frequently to get the temp right. I don't use it to heat as much as I used to, it's in an air conditioned office now, still at my feet."
3,Great when worked. But plug got burnt,"After using this nice little heater for six months, for some reason, the plug got burnt and melted. The wall outlet got burnt and had to be replaced. Dont know what happened. Since the plug wire was burnt, could not use it or replace the plug as its directly connected to the heater base. Discarded this and looking for a new one.."
2,I wouldn't buy again,"This heater is small, that's about all it has going for it.I don't understand many of the positive reviews.This heater shuts off every 5 minutes! It is still cold, yet it shuts off!It can almost make a cold room of 10x10 bearable....almost.And, it is not really that quiet when operating.Again, the worst part is that it shuts off every 5 minutes when it is still cold.My advice would be to stay away from this product and get something else."
4,good space heater,"This is a very compact, but good heater. during a recent cold spell here in Hawaii it was in the mid to upper 50's( I know that cold for us is not cold for the Mainland!) and the DeLonghi Heater fan worked wonderfully, warming a 25'x20' room to a more palatable 73F. The reason for only 4 stars is I'm not sure if it would work well in colder climates, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. price was a little on the high side, but the free shipping made up for it."
2,How did this get great reviews?,My husband thought the reviews on this product were excellent but I'm not sure how. It is nice and small but the fan has no power to push the heat anywhere. This one is going back.
5,Does the job well,I bought this over a month ago and am very satisfied. It is primarily used as a foot warmer while sitting on the couch or under the computer desk. The thermostat has two level setting and the fan has 6 speeds. The heat is noticeable only when the controls are set to max. It is being used atleast for a few hours daily and has worked consistently.
4,Very silent heater,I like this heater because it is very silent. But the inconvenience is that it can not warm my room enough. I think this heater is not enough to warm up my big room.
5,Works perfectly as a small heater,"Not much more to add to the title... If you need a small, safe heater, this works well. You can put your hand in front of the grill while the heater runs on high and not get burned, which is perfect. If you're looking to heat anything larger than a cubicle, you'd probably be better off looking elsewhere, but for small jobs this heater's great."
2,Heater,does not work as well as previous one I owned (exactly alike). I have started using my old one and put the new one away as backup.
1,Short cycle,"This heater is not worth the money because it only heats for about 5 minutes and shuts off, no matter how cold the room is. It then will restart after about 15 to 20 minutes."
1,Turns off too soon and too often,"This product's safety feature is overly safe and you can't even warm your feet properly but what it's kicking off...and it takes forever for the sensor to cool to the point where it will kick back on. Not even worth $20, let alone this price tag. It certainly is quiet though....mostly because it hardly ever kicks on."
5,Great little heater,"For twenty bucks this heater performs very well. I use it on the ""low"" setting and it keeps the bedroom nice and toasty during the evening hours. It's much more economical to heat one room rather than the entire house and the thermostat ensures that it will run only when it needs to. Build quality is good. It comes in white which suited the room I wanted to place it in. Very happy with this purchase."
3,"Worked OK, but eventually died","I used to keep a small space at 70f consistently. The dials, per other reviews, are not well aligned and a little difficult to deal with, but it worked fine for about 2 years - but eventually the fan seized up."
2,bad bad controls,"Something I really never gave much thought to before this heater, but the worst controls ever! Really hard to see anything - fan speed or heat setting. Dials are same colour plastic (not like picture) with small embossed/partially obscured numbers (or some symbol???).I give it a 2/5 only because it is a quiet fan with a stable base.I'm curious who approves a product like this at DeLonghi?"
1,Faulty heater,"It took a while to take this out of the box so the initial return time had come and gone. When I plugged this in, it had a weird plastic, burnt smell. I guess that's not unusual when heaters are new, but after about an hour it started smoking, badly. This was purchased for an elderly person and I just didn't want to mess with it, so we unplugged it and threw it away."
2,This heater is only $14.95,"I bought this heater from Amazon in January 2008 for $14.95. How can it possibly be $79.99 now? It doesn't work very well and shuts off continuously. It is worth $14.95, but certainly not $79.99."
2,It blows :(,"I wanted something to put under my desk at home since I'm on the computer a lot. This heater blows out warm air right away, but turns off for no apparent reason, is difficult to figure out and lacks a lot of features.There are two dials on it that are impossible to read without picking it up and looking at it closely. There is no ability to move the direction of the air to blow up or down, left or right. It just blows one direction. Also, it seems to use up a lot of electricity and has caused me to run outside to the circuit box several times. It shuts off whenever it wants to... even if it's still very cold under my desk! There is no way to make it start up again until it wants to.I wish I knew these things before I bought it, because I wouldn't have. There are better space heaters out there in this price range."
2,Spend more !,"I read the reviews before I bought this heater, not that $15 were a major risk, but still wanted something efficient. Well, it is not. I wish I spent a little more money and got something that I actually can feel when under my desk... But it is true, it is very quiet, it is just very hard to feel the heat."
3,you get what you pay for,"I used to own this heater--until it just up and died on me one day. It was fine while it worked. I was using it to keep warm in my office. It only heats a tiny space at a time, so it didn't even keep my entire office warm--only about a 2 foot radius of where I placed it. I worked only for one season and then stopped working one day."
2,Not that hot,"This space heater was not of the quality I was hoping for. The fan is out of balance so it makes a lot of noise when it is on and shakes the floor. Also the Lo setting is worthless, not hot at all. The Hi setting is better but still not as hot as I would expect. This product is made in China"
2,Very Disappointing,"This unit is poorly made. The product hype says quiet operation, it is not... The fan is very noisy.We bought this unit to warm a section of our porch and we wanted the white color to match the porch decor. Well, the unit is white but the cord is black. Why would the manufacturer do that?The controls are cheaply made and not very exact ... and the unit cannot be turned off entirely without unplugging it.It heats fairly well ... but I strongly suggest you find another brand."
2,Broken after the first month.,This was a great heater the first month when it was working. Warms and maintains a bedroom at a very comfortable temperature for the size. Unfortunately mine broke and the fan no longer spins. Good luck to you other people.
4,Perfect for bathroom or under your desk at work,"This basic, no frills heater will do the job if you need a cheap way to heat a *very* small area.If you're looking for something to heat a larger area (like your bedroom) this is NOT your device, but I use it under my desk at work and it is flawless for that purpose.It doesn't heat the room- it just keeps me from getting chills, which is exactly what I want at work. What I like most is that the heat and fan are controlled independently so you can opt to turn the heat off but keep the fan on- so it serves double duty, giving you a small breeze when you're just a little warm."
2,No off/on button. Must unplug to turn off.,"What I don't like about this heater/fan:1-There is no off/on button.2-The red light stays on whenever the fan/heater is plugged in - so even when the heater isn't ""on"" it still has a bright red light that looks like it needs to be turned off, but there is no off button - you have to unplug it.3-The two dials on the top of the fan/heater are not marked well and are not intuitive."
3,Just an okay product.,I am not impressed with this heater since it barely heats up the room and then shuts off. It takes a good few minutes before it automatically comes back on. I've had it for about 2 years now. I do like that it does not short out any fuses in my home like my previous heater did.
5,Great little heater!,"I switched from an oil furnace as my primary heat source to a pellet stove in the living room. That works great, but when I need to shut the bedroom door, my bedroom gets cold. I put this heater in a corner, turned it on and was warm almost instantly. It is very quiet. I really like the safety features on this and it is small enough to be unobstrusive. Have bought more for the basement. Great deal!"
2,Dissapointed,I was dissapointed that in the description it says the heater will turn off when tipped over. When I tipped it over it did not shut off. The instructions on the inside of the box said it will shut off if there is an obstruction infront of the heater or if it gets overheated. It also does not have a shut off and needs to be unpluged to fully shut it off. Other then that it seems to be a good heater and is quiet.
4,For that extra heat...get this,"This product is a must have if you don't have suitable heating. A coworker said that he used this very product to keep his room warm and cozy. I bought two of these to help me during cold weather at the office where the heat is not too great. So far, so good! It is basically noiseless and a great investment. I've kept one at the office and gave the other to a friend. She is still singing praises about it!"
4,Just what I needed,"Some are too big, some are too small to work well at all, this one was just right."
2,"It works well , then it stops ...","The heater works well when it works. It fills medium and even larger rooms with nice warm air. The only problem with the heater is it turns off when it wants to. The settings don't allow for continues running and when it turns off it doesn't initially come back on. Over all its good for keeping small spaces warm in large spaces, ie office cubical, garage work space, or living room sofa. It doesn't work well in small spaces like bathrooms, its auto off feature kicks in. Overall I will return the heater for a different model."
3,"Powerful heat, but has its drawbacks","I do have 3 of these now. One for each bedroom since most of our bedrooms are over the garage and the forced air ducts just don't seem to cut it in the dead of winter. They really heat up the entire room without any problems and fairly quickly.The only drawbacks are that if you knock it over, it doesn't always shut-off (supposedly has a tipover safety shutoff function, but it's not reliable if you ask me), and it's tricky to get it to shutoff before the room just gets too hot. You need a lot of trial & error to position the knobs just right so that the room stays approximately at the desired temperature. But often your room may be a little too hot or a little too cold. But for the price, I can't complain."
4,Great office warmer...,"Perfect to take the chill off a never quite warm enough office. This unit is quiet, small and does the job. Can't beat the price either. Only cons are temp & fan adjustments aren't strikingly obvious, and the light stays on even when unit is off."
2,not too good for the money,"Plenty of small sized heaters on the market that are better quality than this one. It's a great size and I liked the controls for adjusting the temp and air flow but this unit stopped working after one season! I live in CA (hardly low temps!) and used it occasionally during last winter in my garage to keep my feet warm while doing the laundry. I would say it died with less than 40 hours of usage. Maybe I just had a lemon but I had all kinds of problems with it, including blowing circuits if it was plugged in and my daughter plugged in the hairdryer in another outlet on the same circuit. (My house is only 12 years old and no electrical problems.) Anyway, I wouldn't spend $5 on another one like this!"
2,Don't Waste Your Money!!!!,"I purchased this heater to use under my desk at work. I read the reviews and most were good so I purchased this thing and I hate it! It has an automatic shut-off and it is off more than it's on. Just when I start to warm up the thing shuts off! Ugh! I should have spent a little more money, but I thought know one could really mess up a heater. WTF!"
3,"Buy on price, not quality","Good:* cheap* long 6-foot cord* grill rounded outward keeps it from rolling over face-down* dense slats to keep kids' fingers outBad:* very noisy for its size (safe grill design is BAD acoustic design)* mechanical thermostat activates over about 5 degreesVerdict:The thermostat would be the deal breaker for most uses. Once it kicks in, it doesn't shut off until the room heats by about 5 degrees. Then the room has to cool that much before it kicks in again. Having the room fluctuate that much is unpleasant. Similarly, the noise level makes the on/off transitions conspicuous enough that you don't want this in your bedroom if you're a light sleeper.This would be a great choice if you want to create a warm zone in a much bigger area, however. If you need a cheap heater under the desk in a cold workplace, you couldn't do much better without doubling the price."
1,Thermostat doesn't work,"I have another Delonghi heater that I love, but I bought this one new, and it does not work properly. It turns off when the room isn't warm yet even when I set it to the hottest thermostat setting. How annoying that I can't use it to warm the room because it turns off!!"
2,A heater with a bad attitude.,"Fan goes on.Fan goes off.Fan goes on.Fan goes off.Meanwhile, you freeze.That is more or less a summary of how the unit works. There's no way to ""force"" it to stay on, either, so if your SafeHeat Fan Heater doesn't feel like cooperating with you you're pretty much on your own with this thing.I'd return it, but it only cost me $15, so it's not worth the effort."
1,Doesn't warm up a room,"It keeps turning itself off before the room is warm. I have another DeLonghi about the same size that works just great, but I couldn't find the same one so I purchased this one. It's terrible!"
3,"Not bad, not great either.","After staying in a freezing office for way too long, I decided to purchase this item. I put it under my desk and it keeps me warm while it is on, but the temperature control has it turn off and then I'm cold until it comes on again. I prefer to have it constantly heat the room until I turn it off. Like the other reviewer mentioned, it needs an on/off switch. I must say that it is better than nothing, but I was expecting more. My co-worker has a small one and that thing can heat up my entire cubicle--I was expecting the same :("
2,so-so,"I purchased this as a secondary heater to leave inside the bathroom.For the price, I guess it's just ok. But for people who haven't purchased this yet, I'd recommend paying a bit more. The heater is quiet and it is pretty safe (I tried tipping it over just to see, and it automatically shut off). However, I don't really feel a lot of heat and I've had better heaters in the past. I have a Lakso remote-controlled heater and this is what I use in my bedroom every night. Much more expensive (around $40+ vs. $15) but you get what you pay for. What I also don't like is this doesn't oscillate.Bottomline: it's ok, but if you're looking for a primary heater for your bedroom, you might be disappointed."
2,you get what you pay,For 15$.... this is all you can expect. The thermostat controls are a big mystery. Pay a extra 20$ and get a decent one.
2,Junk,"Don't be fooled by the low price, thinking you'll get a good value. This is a very poorly made product. Mine didn't even last a week before it died, so I upgraded to a Vornado, which is VASTLY better."
2,Not for very cold weather,"Pros: Quiet operation, cheap, stylish.Cons: You cannot run on high heat, heat sensor shut down and never come back. the problem is sensor is too close to heating coil, it take time to cool down. even your room is chilly cold, heater is still off. Ridiculous."
2,did not like very much,"When I got this lil heater I expected it to dod a lil more then wht it did it only got warm not to hot,it just was not what I was looking for."
4,Still going strong after two years,"The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have an actual on/off switch. When you plug it in, it's ON. Turning the heat dial down helps reduce the 'snap' at outlet when you plug it in."
3,"Meh heater, cheap price.","One minute I'm listening to this thing rattle, the next it turns off while it is still cold in here...? Not a great product, but I won't send it packing yet. Admittedly the problem may be mostly user error with this item, since the dials don't make sense to me and are hard to read. I noticed that comment about the dials in other reviews before purchasing, and I didn't think it would make a big difference. Turns out that it does!Hmm. I guess when it works it is an acceptable product. I'm not freezing in my home office anymore, so that's something. I am still going to replace this for a better model that I don't have to tinker with as often.Oh, well!"
3,Very Basic... Probably too basic.,"This thing is made cheaply. You can't see the marks on the dials and the light remains on even if you turn the unit off. So you don't really know if you've turned it off or not. Its the cheapest piece of plastic I have ever seen.It does heat and I bought it for the safety features, but once you see how cheap the thing is, you start to wonder what corners they cut on the safety mechanisms."
1,Shuts Down On High Heat,"The quiet low volume fan moves air even more gently when extra line electricity is drawn on the high heat setting and in no time instead of a warmer bathroom the safety feature shuts down the entire unit. I checked -- this is not the thermostat, even fan only will not function. Obviously the weak fan allows the higher heat setting to warm the unit itself enough trigger the safety shut down. I think this is a design flaw not an actual safety hazard. I am about to return this to Amazon and have already purchased from Amazon the DeLonghi DCH1030 which is excellent. Both fans by the way aim the hot air up sufficiently to not heat at all the surface on which they are placed -- unlike a Holmes unit I used many years but placed on a hotplate for safety."
1,cheap!!!,fair price but product is cheap it stops when it's over heated not when you are. i would sugest spending a little more.
2,Next to useless,"Well, here are my problems with this unit:1) It barely works. I use it in a 12x14 foot bedroom. There are two settings, 1500 watts and 750 watts, and you have to have it on 1500 before it warms the room at all. At 750, I can put my freezing hands in front of it and the air coming out of it feels slightly above lukewarm. If I leave it on for a half hour, it raises a closed 60 degree room to 62. This has to be the most inefficient space heater on earth to produce such little heat with 750 watts of power. Literally every other ceramic heater ever made is better. You'll spend much more on electricity over time than you save on the heater. There are much better heaters out there, please buy a different one instead - ANY one. You can't possibly do any worse.2) There's no off switch!!! I couldn't believe this until I read the manual, and sure enough - if you want to turn it off you have to unplug it. Ridiculous!3) It's ugly as sin - it looks like some kind of avant garde sliced egg."
1,Do not waste your money,This fan shuts off quickly and it would not turn back on. I can not understand such a useless item can be sold on Amazon. I called the manufacture for replacement but was refused. Do not waste your money to buy any products from this company.
4,"Great Album, NOT out of print!","Interesting mix of locally-based Tucson musicians and national talent (Michelle Shocked, Michael Franti, the late great Lalo Guerrero) recorded at Tucson's Community Radio KXCI. Politically themed with songs abut the border, immigration, war, etc. Available through the station (google ""kxci"")along with lots of other compilation CDs recorded in the performance studio."
2,it's alright,"Heard His Much Hyped Album&though the Comparrisons to D'angelo are there&whatnot I felt that Dude was more closer to Donnell Jones with His Voice&some of the Songs pulling the Hybrid element of Michael Jackson&Stevie Wonder.for Me hearing this Set Sounds Like Dude Loved Him MJ's ""Off the Wall"" Like Many of Us back in the day&Still to this day.He is Talented but I don't Hear a knock out Cut.He ain't the 2nd - Coming of D'angelo or R.Kelly but a Artist with a Chance to Grow over time."
5,One of the greatest CDs ever!,"Doesn't get any better than this!! Extremely meaningful lyrics. Very romantic, but also some energetic tracks. I've bought this CD 3 times... whenever it gets scratched or ""borrowed""."
5,Blown Away... By Mr. Dwele,"I heard one song ""Find a Way"" on my way home one day, I immediately went to my local music store.. sang the song to them, and the store employee said.. you are the 3rd person today to buy that CD from me.. let me know..if you really like it.. there are no words to describe this CD. I have a very long commute and it is so refreshing to hear real music, without all the raunchy lyrics and degrading of my sisters. This is a sure thing, and would recommend this CD to everyone I know!!!!"
5,FROM SONGWRITER!!,"my wife brought home this CD and said that I would love it!! now being a songwriter/musican/ I listen more than the average person so it takes a lot to impress me. Yes he sounds like DeAngelo..Prince ...and you can hear the influence of the ""God of music"" the great Stevie who needs to bless us with new stuff Stevie I know you are busy, but we need you!!!back to this brotha...great Rhodes..smooth vocals I love harmonies..""Subject"" with that ""haunting "" String in the backround then the beat sneaks in....and some of those riffs sound like parts taken from An old Denise Williams song...told you I really take apart a song!...but over all the stuff is good driving/thinking /chilling music..it is true that radio is in desperate need of real music!..this does it for me!!..Also if you have not done so get Clay Aiken (the real winner)...Stevie Wonder come back!! peace and blessings write me @songwriter58@blackvoices.com all replys welcome!!"
2,2.5 STARS ACTUALLY...,"He's ALMOST there but not quite. Dwele suffered from monotony and unfortunately a lot of has to do with his very own voice. Not too much change in it so you kinda get lulled into thinking every song is the same. There are a few nice tracks on this set though: ""Subject"", ""Find A Way"" ""Money Don't Mean A Thing"", and ""Lady At Mahogany"" are nice grooves. I'd get it just to add it, just to say ya got it. (wink!)"
2,STILL IN INFANT STAGES,"DWELE HAS NOT DEVELOPED TO HIS FULL POTENTIAL.AS AN ARTIST, HE STILL HAS A LOT OF GROWING TO DO. THIS IS ABOUT AS HONEST A REVIEW AS I CAN GIVE."
4,Very Chilled Out and Different!!!,"This is a nice addition to the neo-soul movement, if we want to call it that. Dwele's music is largely chilled and relaxed so it is perfect for lounging at home or taking a cool little drive on a summer day. The lyrics are sometimes simple and borderline blue collar, and I am not sure why--I guess they reflect his reality. But the music is beautiful. My only request on the next album is that we see more vocal range in Dwele--some shouting and hollering or something every once in a while.... :>"
4,Another Neo Soul Classic,This album is a must for the collect. Like opening up a cold bottle of wine! Smooooooooooth
4,The Truth,"I don't know if I would call this Cd a debut or not, becausehe has an independent Cd floating around titled ""Rize"". I think that ""Subject"" is good cd with some stand out tracks. The one track that you should hear isn't on the album. If you can find ""rize"" I say pick that up as well as ""subject"". His music is so melodic, and relaxing. Also be on the look out for an upand coming artist named Raheem DeVaughn."
2,Sleepy Dwele...,"His voice sounds like Musiq Soulchild, I don't think it's a good thing...And it's hard to say his debut is a good one, cuz I didn't ""find a way"" to go into it...Unfortunately, I heard too many so so tracks...Maybe ""Find a Way"",the title track are in the right direction, ""Money Don't Mean a Thing"" is decent,and the only track I really like..."
5,No Better Subject...,"I first heard this CD while I was sampling it in Virgin. From the very first time I heard it, I was in love. I can sit and listen to Dwele's entire CD and never grow tired of it. He has something for every mood. If you like neo-soul, then you'll love Dwele."
4,easy listening,"dwele's debut album subject is a view into his inner world. it has melodious grooves and a rhythm all its own. if you are a neo.soul fan, or interested in knowing what the 'hype' is all about, check out dwele in 'subject' or 'some kinda' and enjoy th ride!"
4,I am still playing this...,"I listen to this at least once a week and I bought this back in 2003. There are a few songs that could have been left behind, but this CD has a great playback value for me, personally. Some of the songs I enjoy are:TruthTwuneanundaA.N.G.E.L. (interlude)Day at a timeHold OnKick out of youWhoomp (interlude) (the background is nice)MahoganyLet you hair downOverall this is a good CD"
3,A little disappointed,"When I first heard ""Find A Way"" I knew I had to get this CD. Then I heard some of the other tracks on the web. When I got the CD home and listened to the whole thing, I was a little disappointed. I think there are some other artists that are better or maybe this album just doesn't showcase his talent."
2,Average,"A friend of mine recommended Dwele cd. I don't like his vocals too much. His lyrics are simple to me. Track # 4, and the Track titled Subject. I don't get what he talking about. He does'nt have a lot of range and sings in one tone. I Do like the way it starts off and with the dialogue and the beat kicks in. The tracks that I immediately liked is Hold On, Track 10 and Track 14, Lady of Mahogany and thats it! I listen to 2 songs out of 14 and toss it to the side.But he is average to me, nothing to get excited over. I rather listen to Javier who has beautiful vocals and lyrics. Javier is worth every cent!"
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!,Dwele is a great Album if you want to go to sleep. I am telling you that as soon as you put in you will start to fall asleep. Do not waste your time.
2,"Nice grooves, decent production...","weak songs. With some exceptions--Money, Find a Way--I couldn't grasp any hooks or any verse-chorus-bridge demarcations. I hope with the new album we'll be able to hear more songwriting ability. I know songwriting is generally formulatic these days but in the hands of a gifted practitioner, those ""traditions"" provide a structure and model for variable musical expression and overall satisfaction...sort of, ""out of the One comes ten thousand Things"" so to speak. My two cents."
3,wanted more...,"I found out about Dwele on here, never heard of him before. He has a nice soulful voice. I really liked the first couple of tracks on this album. The songs that follow, kinda sound the same. Also, there is that continuous ""intro- of SUBJECT"" (being the name of the album) carried throughout the tracks and it kind of interupts the flow of it. I prefer full bodied tracks. I can see why he may have incorporated this, but it doesn't really work for me. Although, I do like this album because of selected songs, so it is worth the $9.99 that it is."
4,Nice cd!,I am really enjoying this cd. Dwele is laid back and has a nice voice. Add this one to your collection if you don't have it already.
4,Sleeped on...,"You know, Dwele has really nice chill voice. I gave it only 4 stars because i play the whole album after about track 3 or 4. Dwele is just doing his thing and trying to let you feel Detroit. He's really popular at the Jazz Cafe in London, out here. Check him out and please don't hate.My fav'sI Get A Kick Out of YouWithout You"
4,His voice is...........,"soothing. I first heard this CD after a long day out. I laid in bed and listened to the whole CD. Dwele's voice is relaxing. ""Hold On"" is the best of them all. It's good to see artists like this who don't fall into the commercialized image of today's R&B."
4,Dwele did the damn thing!,"I am a new Dwele fan, I honestly bought the cd just because of the song &quot;Hold On&quot; But after listening to this cd, I must say he is a very soulful artist.........And what I love about it is, his album is not &quot;all over the place&quot;... Which basically means he's not trying to cram a whole lot of different styles into one album.. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because even though he shows a consistancy in his songs....they seem to eventually have the same beat or rhythm. But all in all, I can literally let the entire cd play without wanting to skip to the next song!"
4,a new soul star,"Dwele ""Subject"" cd is one I happen to stumble on while I was visiting Tower Records one night. The beats, the basslines, and the vocals caught my attention as I was browsing for music. This album is great from start to finish with stand out tracks being: #1-5,16,12,7-10. I sure hope Virgin Records and radio stations across the nation help push this brotha's project."
4,Right on the money,"I heard 'Find the way' on the radio a couple of times but could not make the artist's name (cause the DJ's kept mis-pronouncing his name). A friend of mine bought it for me on my birthday and I was like who's this and he said listen to track 3 and I instantly said yeah that's the guy! Love 'Truth', 'Sho ya right' (reminds me of a Maxwell joint), 'Hold on' and 'Find the way' the most but the whole album jells and hold's together nicely"
5,Smooth,"What can I say? Dwele proves that he can ponder throughout the neo-soul crowd on his own, with very little commercialism. The album starts off with a smooth interlude, then takes you off throughout the journey of Dwele. His style alone puts him in a class of his own. None of the ""I was with your girl the other day"" type of lyrics will be found within this album (Dwele's a clean artist with a very rich and smooth voice). Production is top-notch (Dwele having written and produced about 95% of the album himself) and is a huge step away from the commercialized R&B which has flooded today's industry. If you're looking for an original R&B artist who uses no samples from other artist's music, and produces and writes their own music, then Dwele is where you'll want to be. Dwele is a talented impulsive artist, who has a bright future waiting straight ahead. A needed breath of fresh air."
2,........,"I don't understand the hype about this Dwele album. My mother was like `Please get the Dwele album for my birthday!'...so I was like aight coo you can have that. Went out and bought two copies (because of its low price), gave one to my momma (along with some other stuff) and took the other home to listen to it. All I can say is What's the big deal?!? He can sing yes, and it definitely has the sound but it is sorta watered down. I agree with reviewers mistermaxx and Addicted To The Groove. ""Is it listenable? yes, Memorable? Not really"" None of the songs jumped out and GRABBED me. It all blended together. I was listening to the album and got to the end without using rewind one time (used fastforward a couple times though). Sad to say it's been collecting dust ever since and my mother's more into the new Mary J. Blige album anyway...I guess that's the breaks."
3,"Ok, but misses its mark","I listened to his CD,but couldn't find his groove. The music was nice, but found the something with the singing just not right, didn't quite blend, or too bland. Didn't add any depth to the music, found myself bored when listening to this cd. Giving it a 3 only because the music is decent."
2,A different style...,"When I first saw his video for ""Find a Way"", I was hyped about Dwele. But after buying the cd, I was madly disappointed. I don't really like his style of singing. In a way, its not all singing which is cool, if you like that sound. But for me. I couldn't get past all the half talk, half rap, D'Angelo feel he has to his music. To each its own, but I don't really like this cd. I think he has mad potential in his craft. Maybe a second time around will impress me.dyc~"
1,This has to be a rehersal tape! Very amaturish!,"This looks like a home video. There are several gaps in the music, the group is never in step, Leslie laughs and makes innane comments continuously. The ""Walk Aerobics For People Over Forty"" is better and there is not much difference in the workout"
1,Very little taste,"My child rarely has candy so her perception of ""sweet"" is more geared to fruit than to junk food. Still, she won't eat these laces and told me they have almost no taste at all. I tried some and have to agree with her."
5,This song is awesome,"If you don't want to wait for the album, this song is really awesome. I have the LP single and I think the remixes might be different, but this is a great synth-pop track featuring the lovely singer from Dubstar. I belive a member of Depeche Mode is involved with this band as well. It is very catchy, poppy, upbeat, but not bubblegum. Reminds me of New Order, but more synthy and a female vocalist. Definitly check it out."
2,Not recommended,"I've had this product for about a year now and I would have to say I wish I had spent my money on a tradional toaster oven instead. The toaster part cooks the toast the same no matter where I set the adjustable lever, and the top brown only part only warms/browns half of whatever I put in there. It ended up being a disappointment that sits on my counter as a daily reminder."
2,"No door, no heat","Great idea if it had a door to keep the heat in. Don't buy this, it takes forever to heat up a simple slice of pizza."
4,Long time user,I have had this toaster for at least 5 years and have enjoyed the versatility of toasting vertically or horizontally. That way we don't take up valuable space for both kinds of toasters. We have changed our kitchen colors and I would like to find another similar type toaster in stainless or black. Does anyone know of a similar type of dual toaster? I looked at same company and they do not offer it any longer.
2,Terrible Toaster,It toasts unevenly in the vertical or horizontal position. Forget about reheating a slice of pizza. The horizontal postion is the worst. The hot air escapes because there is no door.
1,Went Dead,"We purchased this product from Sears right before christmas of 05. The purchase price was 149.00. I should have known that meant it was cheap, but we were on a budget, so we bought it anyway. We had no problems with it until August of 06. When the disc was playing, all the color on the tv turned green. Then the screen went black, but we still had sound. We called customer service who told us to send it to them and it would cost us 130 dollars to have it fixed. The whole thing just feels like a scam. Would anyone actually send it in? I will never purchase a Koss product, and I hope they go bankrupt due to their business dealings."
4,Good system for the money,"I bought the model below this one yesterday, the 3102. That model is 500 watts, not 520. But, I do have to say I was surprised at the sound that came out of these speakers. It's true, the controls are a little unresponsive and the speaker cords are too short. But for the money, it is an excellent system. I tested the system out by listening to a few Trance cd's, Ray Charles, and Frank Sinatra. Music quality was excellent. I then watched Band of Brothers. The subwoofer definitely pumps out some great bass. I hadn't really watched the movie until I watched it in surround sound. All in all, I would recommend this system if you're looking to get a good surround sound system for a small price. Just pick up some extra speaker cord."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"Very flimsy, have to use 3 or 4 at a time for absorbancy, more the size of 2x2 than 3x3."
4,Received with 2GB card installed,FYI- Amazon's web page says ships with 64MB card... on 1/19/2012 my order arrived with a 2GB card installed.Initial impressions about this device are very good.Acquires sats fast; intuitive; arrived with latest software/firmware (verified at Garmin.com).Have loaded free topo maps from GPS File Depot and they look good.Have transferred data from other Garmins without problems.Loading maps could be easier for Mac users (disk shipped with GPS not Mac compatible). GPSFileDepot.com does have good instructions... once I found those all went well.
4,worth it,"Bought this for my bush walking trip, I am very glad I did.-Extremely easy to use-Great battery life-Very portable and accurate-Memory card allows a lot of data to be keptIt is a bit expensive, but see it more as an investment because it can do so much for you."
4,Thumbs up on the GPSMAP 60CSx,"Got this little 60CSx recommended by a friend recently and was stoked to get it from Amazon. It has been a great tool for trail running, on the water, and on the road. Geocaching has been a new family treat with this gadget. I did experience one problem with the 60 CSx; After a couple weeks the dsp port stopped working...Garmin told me to let Amazon know about it. I sent it back and Amazon sent me another one right away.. I was amazed and now I'm up and running with my Garmin almost everywhere I go...Can't wait to take it to Mt. Whitney this summer....Great price..., however, download maps can be a little pricey. But def. a quality gadget."
1,Died on Day One!,"Looked Good. Functioned Well. Map Upload Was great.Unfortunately, the Backlight stopped working on Day one!GREAT CREDIT to Amazon for immediately replacing it though!Hopefully, the replacement unit will last longer."
1,Garmin 2008 Topo Map of Souteast,"I just recieved my Garmin GPS 60CSx and after some help from Garmin, the help was good, installed the Topo 2008 for the Southeast.I live on a Lake which is over 200 acres and has been in the area and a part of the Geography here in the Alpharetta,GA area since around 1980.So, where is the lake? its not on the map, yet it has been here for 25 years. All the map shows is a stream that runs through the area.If this map is this poor, its not going to help me go where I need to go. This is in a word unacceptable!"
3,Garmin 60CSx is great but lacks GeoCache Details,"I've had my 60CSX for over a year and it has worked well for driving directions (detailed US Maps extra) and for geocaching. However, the 60CSX seems out of date, in terms of GeoCaching. Only the Cache Number & 44 characters of Cache Description are stored on theunit.If I could go back, I would have gotten a Delorme PN-20 or PN-40 just because these units include detailed maps and provide geocache details on the unit at a very good price for a durable looking GPS unit."
3,good but lacking,"This GPS was going to be the replacement for the Garmin etrex legend but I can't really use it yet because the map program preloaded is not good enough to nav by. I have not purchased the mapping program required to do this for two reasons; first, its expensive ( $120.00 or so)second, you have to have a DVD reader on your computer to use it ( which I don't have, another $40.00). After spending almost $400.00, not including the above $160.00, I can't Nav as well as my $170.00 Etrex Legand. Sure the color screen is better by far and it has more bells and whistles but useless until I come up with more $$$$$.. Absurd!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Had they told me about these requirements in thier explaination of this product I wouldn't have bought it."
2,Worked well before it died,I have used this unit for about 45 days of field work over two summers. It was always kept in a case and handled gently. It stopped powering up in the field. Seems to be the power switch. Worked well while it lasted but was not reliable for me.
4,Gift appreciated but hard to figure out even for a techy,"I ordered this gift for Christmas for my husband. Item arrived on time as expected. Although being a tech savvy guy, he struggled with getting this item to work. After talking with the help line he learned several things that were not mentioned in the book - book is great for telling what buttons to push to get desired screen, but no help in telling you why you need the screens or how to use the screens to get the info you need. Also, no maps come pre-loaded with the item which made understanding what was happening that much more difficult. After installing trail/hiking maps and working with help desk my husband is happy with the item. It doesn't do everything he thought it might (never intended to use this for roads - intended to use for hiking) but he is happy."
4,Whoever Thought I'd get a GPS,"After a friend took a class on geocaching, I got interested in using a handheld unit on our 80 acres. We do a lot of habitat work and I wanted to be able to map different burn units and plantings. I have found the unit fairly easy to use despite my lack of technical knowledge. I ordered the TOPO maps for North America so we would have elevations and they downloaded very easily. I also used the unit to track our progress on a Thanksgiving trip. I am impressed with the ability to lock onto satellittes while sitting in the living room (first floor) of our two story house."
4,"Great Product, poor documentation","The product performed very well, even in the narrowest canyons of Utah. It is well made, rugged case, definitely gives you the feel of a solid piece of hardware.My only complaint is with the documentation that came with it. Much of it was written in broken english and left you wondering ""how do I do that?"" The only real way to learn how to use it was by trial and error."
5,Great Value,"I am mainly using this GPs for GEO Caching, but have found it is great for directions and for finding points of interest. Amazon by far is the best deal that anyone has to offer."
5,Garmin 60 Csx,"Garmin GPS MAP 60CSX Color GPSOutstanding GPS was suprised was able to track satellites from inside thehouse!! I am using with City Navigator 2008, Topo 2008 and Geocachingfeatures work well and has accesories for ATV handle bar mounts. Well worth the cost. Five Stars."
1,Not as great as people say,I was very dissappointed with the Garmin 60 CSX. I am a regular NUVI 360 user and like it very much. The 60CSX is no where near as bright as I had expected. The manual is very poorly written and very little of the product is intuitive. You need to purchase and additional $100 TOPO 24 map for trails and a $50 2 GB SD micro chip to store the data. hen you can't read the topo information on the GPS. The downloading of data is a real pain. Also the SD card holder is very fragile and poorly designed.Amazon was great and let me return it. Go Amazon!
5,Garmin 60CSx,"This product is all that it's cracked up to be. I had purchased a Nuvi 660, but it's not designed fro geocaching, the 60CSx fills the bill."
1,Map Rip-Off,"The maps that this comes with are useless. The maps you have to buy for it are very expensive (can easily cost more then the unit itself). When you buy the maps, you don't really own them. They can only be used in that one GPS. If you buy a new GPS, you have to buy the same maps again (not cheep) for each unit.I had two Garmin GPS units and was expecting to use my basic road maps ($125) on both. I had to pay ($99) to get a code to put them on the second unit."
1,Not reliable for cycling,"I bought this unit to use when bicycling, and mounted it on my handlebars using the Garmin bar mount. The unit shuts off whenever moderate road vibration is encountered. It shuts off so much it is completely unusable. After searching the web, it turns out that this is a common problem with most all Garmin GPS units, caused by the batteries breaking contact when the unit is vibrated. I unsuccessfully tried all the ""fixes"" described on the internet to hold the batteries in place, but it turned out the problem is caused by bad design - the internal battery connector is not hard wired to the PC board in the unit, instead a metal connector presses against the board. When vibrated, the connector breaks contact and the unit powers off. Garmin apparently applies only a temporary fix to the unit and does not hard wire the connector when units are sent back to them."
3,"Good unit , But...","This is a good unit. It performs great, locks quickly, almost too many features. But a real downer lies in the display of Garmin's topo map. All the ads you see both on Garmin's site, Even the operation materials shipped with, and every where else show a good contrasting yellow background, Beware that it isn't, and they know it is misrepresented and don't care. I know this as I have contacted them with a promise to get back to me in a couple of days. That was over 2 weeks ago. The back ground is a tan with brown street level roads. Really poor contrast and very difficult to see at times. Certainly leaves you in the lurch, since you can only use their maps."
5,Great for geocaching,"We bought this GPSr mainly for geocaching, and are very pleased with its performance. It acquires satellite signals under heavy tree cover much better then our old unit. It also works well for navigating while driving if you buy the map software and auto accessories."
5,best deal for the price,"We use this religiously overseas in Japan, so we don't get to use all of the features such as the road maps. Even with that being said the product is incredilbe. It does what you want it to and is very accurate. The only thing that does not work that well is when you approach a the entrance to a cave, but that is to be expected when dealing with satilites. We use this product for geocaching and could not be any happier with the product. Easy to read and Easy to use."
4,My fourth Garmin GPS,"As in the title this is my fourth Garmin. The most useful feature for me is the compass. When geocaching previous models were useless when you slowed down because the GPS couldn't tell you the direction. With the compass I let it come into play after stopping.I wish that Garmin would publish that the driving directions are only good for whatever highways are in the device. If you ask for directions that are not located on the map the results are bizarre.There is a little bit of ""feature creep"". Toss in something because we have a computer inside.I am a 25 year Mac user and therefore can't make use of the map download features."
4,A little better than eTrex Vista HCx,"I recently had my Vista HCx stolen and needed a replacement. The 60 CSx seems to be the same, although I did notice that the new unit roamed while standing still, while the Vista didn't seem to do that. Maybe it's because i can see the screen that I'm noticing it now. Anyway, the screen is much easier to see but it doesn't get a bright as the Vista. It's like it has the same amount of available light on both units only the light is spread over a larger distance therefore not as bright on the 60CSx. I'm happy with the unit just like i was with the Vista HCx."
1,Basemap Desparately Needs Updating,"I was disapointed that my new Garmin 60CS still has the old exit numbers for I-95 in its integrated basemap. The planning and migration to the new exit numbers has been in process for years. Yet Garmin has not taken the time to update the exit numbers for their newest GPS units. Garmin's response to my inquiry was ""yes, the basemap is old"" and ""no, we aren't planning on updating it."" At $500 a unit, I feel customers deserve an accurate basemap."
4,Garman 60CSX,I travel a lot and was looking for a GPS that I might easily carry in my briefcase. The Garman 60CSX meets the criteria that I was looking for.With a (2 Gig) mini SD card I can install the complete North America Map program. I also keep a second card with the Mapsource TOPO maps for when hiking.The rating for the 60CSx missed being a 5 because of the cost which is increased by having to go to proprietory programs by Garmin Only. The preinstalled data is minimal.
4,Happy but also dissapointed,"I like a lot this GPS, I get a lot more satelites than with other receivers and up tp +/-3m/10ft accuracy, it is really fast to redraw heavy maps and quick for routing.but I find very dissapointing:- I can't pick to use the GPS altitude over the barometer and this makes no sense at all to me.- I couldn't find a way to get the barometric sensor readings out to my computer to plot the pressure changes, aparently the nmea output only shows GPS altitude and not the altimeter information.there are other functions missing from other GPS's like altitude trend, and tide predictions but not that important.also something very weird is the barometer/altimeter difference, I get over 100mbar difference between both readings.in other words I'd recomend this GPS to anyone, but one need to be very carefull picking, getting the 60 C""S""x serie (Sensors) might no be what you look for or what you expected."
1,No Mac support = No sale,I would love to buy this but they don't have Mac support despite their press release to the contrary months ago.I might buy it and tape it to a GPS with Mac support just to have a second opinion.
2,way over priced,"The features do not remotely live up to the hype. The base map is close to useless and without the addition to the add on map, will do no more than a $150 gps. If I still had the box, I would send it back"
1,DELIVERY OF A DAMAGED PRODUCT,"The product ARRIVED with no problem. I had to download so many updates to actually use it for the intended purpose I needed--Geo Caching. After 3 uses (used it on 3 different occasions) it stopped working. DID NOT DROP IT, did not do anything to it but place it in a drawer, and when I turned it back on there was NO DISPLAY. After calling the company Garmin, who will be replacing the product, they stated that I had received a corrupted product. I am annoyed at having spent $360 only to have to spend another $30 to send the product back. Will I ever buy an electronic product over the internet..NO. Will I ever buy another electronic product from Amazon--NO!!"
4,good but needs a couple of improvements,love the device but the instructions are horrible. i like to geocache & the instructions on what to do & how to get started were very limited. i had to ask a caching friend who had a similiar device tell me what to do. the accuracy is usually dead on except sometimes it gets bounced around when theres too much cover...which you'll prob see w/amy gps. i still really recommend this product to anyone!
5,Best Value,"For the price paid, I feel this product more than exceeded my expectations. The only cautionary advice I can provide involves purchasing topo maps for this device.The Garmin website lists the 100K topo maps at $59.00 per region of the United States. 24K topo maps are $99.99 for two states. If you download these maps, you can only place one at a time on a microSD card regardless of GB available. So, when I travel from Texas to New Mexico, I have to switch out cards.Here's a direct quote from Garmin Tech Support: ""The unit will only read the original file. Renaming the file works on some of our newer units, like the GPSMAP62 series, but unfortunately not on the GPSMAP60 series. Garmin recommends MicroSD cards with a capacity to be no larger than 4GB.""It's not a terrible inconvenience for me, but it may be for some. You can also find these maps cheaper on other sites.Great device though, all of the essentials for many great adventures outdoors!"
4,Not easy to save the topo,"The GPS good but it is not easy to save the topo map on it specially if you want the entire eastern us. It does acquire the satellite quite quick. Yes I am satisfied I use it for trekking but an advice, never forget a map and a compass in your back pack you never know."
4,Garmin 60CSx,"This unit is easy to use and the controls are user friendly. The face is easy to read and includes a backlight which can be adjusted. It includes a data chip which stores mapping data, although you have to purchase an additional chip which has enough memory to utilize the Pacific area. This could have been easily avoided by dividing all the regions into smaller sections. It's unfortunate that Garmin was not more forthright with their advertising concerning this feature."
2,Essentially useless unless you buy mapping software for $130.,"I'm a smart guy, but even I got fooled by this one. Although the product description states that the device comes pre-loaded with a maps of the U.S., it contains data only for US Interstates and major US Highways (not even all of them). Furthermore, the built-in maps are of such poor quality that this device is essentially useless out-of-the-box. Garmin designs their products so that only their proprietary maps will work on the device, so you have to buy them. Add $130 plus S&H for maps to whatever you expect this device to cost you. I couldn't be more angry about my purchase."
3,Good but dont' try the online upgrade,"Purchased the unit for a vacation trip. It worked well and was fun to have along. Fortunately, I didn't try the suggested online software upgrade until after I returned. The unit died right after the upgrade completed. After a 45 minute phone wait, a Garmin service tech recommended I return the unit for replacement. The was two weeks ago and I still haven't received the replacement. Garmin is doing who knows what with it? If some one had told me this story prior to the purchase, I might have reconsidered. Maybe my star rating will change if I only had the unit to play with."
3,garmin 60csx,"i got this for a great price of just above 300 bucks and i still remain a tad disappointed. i downloaded a bunch of mapsource maps off torrents so all the maps cost nothing and not a single map lives up to its title. the maps blow. because of the maps alone i wish i would have gotten a different brand like megallen with the national geographic maps that are real nice and easy to read.as for the handheld unit. it works as its designed to, but there are a few blips in it. overall i dont think this product is worth 300 dollars and the maps arent worth a penny."
4,GPSMap 60CSx,"I purchased this unit to replace my Lowrance Ifinder Hunt that developed display issues during a bow hunting trip last fall. I couldn't be more pleased. The new Sirf III chip is far more accurate than my Ifinder was and the new unit holds satellite lock much much better. There's nothing more frustrating that attempting to drag a nice deer out of public land after dark and your GPS unit can't tell you where you are any closer than 200 feet. That's a ton when your stumbling through the woods dragging a 170 lb. whitetail. The only downside of this unit is the lack of detailed topographic information. Living in northeast wisconsin, you rarely find a 100 ft contour so everything looks flat. Once Garmin updates all their maps to 24000:1, this unit will be hard to beat."
4,Great for your hunter!,"I bought this GPS for my husband this year after he got himself lost during a hunting trip this past fall. I am not a GPS expert and had to rely on online reviews. Well, I apparently did well! My husband loves it and has already used it for hunting! It is apparently user friendly (like the Garmin we have in our car) and the screen is a good size. The only drawback, and why i would rate it a 4 versus a 5 is that all the map software must be purchased from Garmin - I have heard that other models allow for the National Geographic software, while this one does not."
5,The best money can buy!,"I purchased this a little over a year ago and yet I am still learning on a daily basis something new this bugger can do! My only gripe is that I can't seem to figure out how to turn off the ""extrapolate data points when satellite lost"" function. This would require a small software fix, but probably not even worth Garmin's time. Just have to remember to turn it off when I go inside. When outdoors though, this thing is the best!"
4,Garmin GPS,"This has turned out to be a great little unit. The mapping could be better (the additional software) but so far so good. It is great for geocaching, etc. I've only had the unit a month or so but have had zero problems. Signal strength is excellent and picks up signal very quick. This unit probably has more bells and whistles than I will ever use, but for the price it has been a great buy. Unit came highly recommended by Cabela's staff as well. In my preliminary research I could not find a ""bad"" review and now I know why. It is fairly easy to use without getting consumed reading the manual, although it is handy to have. Still waiting on Garmin rebate so my impression could change if that refund is prolonged."
4,Thansgiving Day hunt,"Thanksgiving day I received a cell phone call from my oldest son.He asked me to check on Goolge Earth to give him some idea as to where his was on the tractof land that we hunt. It is a very large tract of state owned land.He was useing another means of GPS that was not the most user friendly.That was my reason for buying the Garmin GPS 60CSx. After reading reviews on the internet of the GPS products out there I chose the Garmin 60CSx.It was bought as a Christmas gift for my son.I know that His wife and children can relax,knowing that he has the means to get out of the woodssafely. ( Dad Too!! ). The look on his face was priceless when he opened the box.I will buy one for myself for the next hunting season here in Upstate New York."
5,Great guide,"Wonderful product for hiking, walking with the family and for our main purpose, hunting. Tracks nicely. Great viewing options. Has tons of memory and sooooooo easy to use. Great for all ages. You have to have one if you walk in the woods at all. Just love it!"
5,Excellent,This GPS unit is very user friendly and easy to put new maps onto. I wish Garmin still made this unit.
5,Great Product,Have only used it a few times. It appears to be great and is a lot of fun to use. Would highly recommend it. Easier to use than some of the older models I have had.
4,Still navigating how to use.,Very nice GPS. Bought it for my wife this past Christmas and she was thrilled. I am confident we will no longer get lost on our hiking trips. Would highly recommend if you are the adventurous type.
4,Garmin rate,"The GPS took some time to figue out. For a newbie, its not exactly user friendly. That can be over come with practice. The Waypoint manager and the preloaded maps are somewhat worthless. Definitely plan on having an experienced GPS user show you the basics and buy an updated map of the areas you wish to travel in. With time and practice, this is an ideal GPS for car, boat, caching, hiking or whatever. It may even serve to keep the kids occupied in the back seat until they feel it is time to teach you how to use it while you try to drive. Enjoy!"
2,another loser from Garmin,"I got a Garmin Colorado, which was horrible, with buggy software, so I returned that and got this based on the quality of the reviews. I should have known better -- this unit is buggy as well. I loaded map data into it and off I went for a family trip to Vermont. Well, when the unit figured out I was in Vermont, it forgot all the map data! I had luckily brought the data with me, so I reloaded it. Then the same thing happened again when I returned home to Oregon -- no more map data.The hardware seems sound, but Garmin needs to ship products with software that works. I tried calling customer support and was told to expect a 15-20 minute wait. Their phone support gets one star out of five from www.gethuman.com, and I understand why.Update as of 1/1/09: I gave up and threw this product out my car window. If you want, go to the intersection of Fox Hollow and Willamette in Eugene, OR and hunt around. That way -- and only that way -- you'll get what you paid for!"
2,Must be the luck of the draw.,"Not so happy with my choice. At first we were thinking get past the learning curve. After some 30 geocaches we deternined it is constintly 23 to 36 feet off the target. Sometimes it just seems drunk. When others in the group are all gathering in the same general locations we found ourselves constantly some 27 feet away. Guess it's the luck of the draw. We just got a bad one. Love the features, it just doesn't get us to the find. Back to our old Migellon 210."
5,Garmin 60csx,"Excellent device, greatly improved battery life over models from 2years ago. Maps need some updating in rural areas."
5,Saved the Day... out for a walk in Arches National Park..,The Garmin 60DSx was with us because it was a new toy and we wanted to put it to the test.. It Passed and saved us when we got disoriented.. we would have had an long extra warm day in the sun.. Thanks Gramin.. we will not leave home without it or the nuvie for the car..
4,GPS60CSX,"I already owned a GPS60CS(2003) and had enjoyed the useof it for exploring gorges and trails near Ithaca, NY.Used magnet antenna to obtain good satellites. Thismethod was a nuisance and often failed. A partnerhad a 60CSX and obtained satellites when I couldn'tso I bought the 60CSX and have been very happy. Amazonshipping prompt,satellites obtained easily even insidemy house or thru clothing. Stable and durable andin my judgement a very fine instrument. Well worthwaiting for the improvement by Garmin and no regretsre the cost of another GPS.I now use the 60CS on my bicycle wherethere is never difficulty with reception."
4,Awsome Handheld GPS,"This Garmin handheld GPS is right on most of the time, even under dense forest cover. However, it does not work in an area of urban skyscrapers. It is perfect for non urban ""geocaching"" or even for driving directions on trips. The downside is that if you want street level and or topographic map software, you have to purchase them separately. Also the micro memory card that comes with the device is not really large enough to cover a whole state like New York. That said, considering the cost, I still believe this is the best portable, handheld GPS on the market today."
4,Reliable Machine but Small Screen,"It doesn't really have to be recommended I believe. Garmin products work. This one is not an exception. I bought it mainly for biking. It prevents me from getting lost. Two areas to improve would be bigger screen with higher resolution and longer battery life. For long trips I need to put solar battery on my bike, cus this little thing drains batteries pretty quickly."
5,Great Product,"I bought this when it was the top of the line. It is a great GPS I have had it for over 6 years now and it is still going strong. I will probally upgrade to the newer touch screen model in the future, however this GPS has been on several 5/5 geotrips, it has swam, rolled down hills, bounced off rocks, survived two trips to NTC and one Iraq deployment and has never let me down."
5,Garmin GPSMAP60CSX,this is my second device i have the GPSMAP60 but due to memory limitation i bought this device where i can use a mini SD memory .i am using this device to navigate while driving my boat it is a water resitant device also while hiking and driving my car i can use it in all my activities best GPS device i ever used...
1,Hard to figure,"If Garmin made an iPod it would be 2"" thick, you would have to turn it off and on again every time you loaded a tune, it would only load tunes after you unlocked them, it would need a 76 page manual and a 104 page manual to operate, it would be covered with little rubber knobs.Look this is a good unit, I will probably get some use out of it, I did buy it after all, it does seem to work, but it is user unfriendly the point of being comic. Just what I don't need when I am tired and lost."
1,Garmin 60CSx,"Functional but not intuitive, difficult to use. Topo 24K is not at all what I expected. Still struggling to learn how to use after several trips to the mountains and the desert. Unit and software are better than nothing, but not by much........"
3,great unit,"This is my second unit. I did own a Etrex Legend, and I bought this one to get a better unit. I did. I can't wait to install my maps when they get here. I use this for Geocaching, and sometimes other maps are better than the basemaps on the unit."
1,"Great unit, don't buy from amazon.",This is a nice unit. I wouldn't buy anything like this from amazon though. Their service is awful. Plus I found cheaper prices on other online and brick and mortar shops. Nice unit but shop around.
2,So far not good....=(,"I understand that the base maps are basically useless, and that I'd be looking at additional cost to load additional material to fully utilize the device. What I was not prepared for is the insane difficulty there would be 1) installing and 2) unlocking the maps.The unlock wizard and online tools ""developed"" are misleading, lumbering, counterintuitive, archaic, and almost completely useless.The windows based unlocking tool does not recognize my online user id, although it was created and used multiple times during the installation process, the MapSource software recognizes my unlock key but says the maps are not installed, my GPS unit says the maps are found but can not be unlocked, online tool says they are installed and unlocked...I'm wiping out and reinstalling x3!!I've been going around in circles for 5+ hours and still no success."
1,Does NOT work with a Mac.,"Although NEVER mentioned in the product description, Garmin GPS units in this general category are NOT Mac compatible. They work ONLY with Windows. For such a well-known brand, this is surprising and extremely inconvenient. The ramifications of this are that the GPS works fine in the field, but waypoint transferring and mapping must be done on a PC platform. Don't have a PC? You're out of luck. Something I wish I had known before spending several hundred dollars on the receiver."
1,garmin is user unfriendly,"I bought a garmin gps 60csx for several hundred dollars for use in all situations, trails, water, road, and paid $100 in US road map softward so I could also use it in my car to find addresses. The software is very user-unfriendly. I do a search for an address in Florida and it can't find a street that's been there for 30 years. It doesn't even have Miami on its list of cities. I am sure there is a way to figure it all out if I spend hours studying it, but its Garmins non-user friendly system and you shouldn't have to do that. It's crap. You'd be better off buying cheap $100 car gps with free road map. But don't buy Garmin, they don't know what user friendly is. And getting hold of tech support to help. You can, but the wait will be long, if not impossible"
4,Garmin GPS Map 60CSx,"Very nice instrument! I used a Garmin E-trex first and liked it then, saw this one. I like the features it has, especially the electronic compass, find screens and geocaching features. I was a little disappointed in the accuracy (not up to date)of the built-in descriptions. The info about my local exit was out of date, many of the businesses are gone. The flexibility is great. I'd recommend it!"
4,Nice little tool.,"This is a nice sized unit. The display is adequate in size and VERY clear. I especially like the fact that the screen is so clear in sunlight. The only problem is that it is a bit difficult to read when in the shade or mottled shade. The auto-night screen is very handy as the contrast changes to be more useful at night. I have already dopped it a few times with no ill results. The buttons and menus seem to be arranged in a logical fashion. However, the toggle could be slightly larger so that one doesn't accidentally toggle to the wrong place. My thumb is large so this is a bit of an issue. It uses 2 AA batteries, which I favor as that is what my camera and flashlight use. Therefore I only need one type of batteries on a trip and can always use the batteries from another device as spares if my actual spare supply is depleted. I haven't had this long, so can't be more specific on features. However, this unit was recommended by a professional surveyor as a good unit for the money."
5,used this for a week straight,"Bought the 2Gig micro SD card and City Navigator V.8. Also the Garmin suction cup device for the windshield.Found excellent reception in deep forest, cities. Never lost contact with satellites except in metal/concrete buildings.City Navigator was flawless in bringing me to the front door of places in the USA and Montreal. Large data base seems to have almost everything in it.Batteries lasted about 15-20 hours. I turned off the electronic compass to save juice. Would buy the power cord if I planned a long car trip, esp. with night driving involved.Programming destinatations is easier in this than in either of my two cars (Infiniti and Acura). I found the beeping noise signalling an upcoming turn to be loud enough and timely in warning of a turn."
4,A gps upgrade,"I use a gps primarly for geocaching, great lakes sailing, returning to fishing spots and distance bicycling. The 60csx is an upgrade from my garmin etrex legend, which i also like and am keeping for a back up.The 60csx is a little larger and easier for my 60yrold eyes to see. It will pick up satellites while in a single floor house - i have never lost a signal in the woods. I like the ""geocache mode"" and find the button locations easier to use than the legend. Garmin has been helpful to ans. most questions regarding operational questions. My only caution would be not to count on using MapSource City Select V6 - it doesn't want to load."
5,Awesome Portable GPS From GARMIN,"I had the Garmin 60CS and it worked great. I now upgraded to the 60CSX. The 60CSX is awesome. You get signal just about anywhere even inside your house. I like to geocache every once in a while and this unit is perfect for it. Especially when you have a lot of tree cover in the woods, the unit can still hold a strong signal. Also add the 1 gig memory card and you can get all of the US installed on it, and if you use the topo and city nav. together you can get half of the US installed. It stores lots of data and gives accurate door to door directions. If your thinking about it, go for it you wont be sorry. I bought it here on amazon and signed up for the mazon credit card and got [...]dollars off and then had a Garmin [...] mail in rebate, so I saved [...] on the unit. I love it. I Love all Garmin products I have used them for years on land and sea."
5,Great GPS,"I got this GPS to replace an older GPS III+ and it has performed great so far. I have used it in a vehicle without external ant., in heavy timber and deep canyons, and in town and always had a good 3d position fix. Garmin's Topo software leaves a bit to be desired but is the only software that can add more map detail in the GPS itself. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a rugged and high performance GPS."
5,I love this GPS,"This GPS is absolutely outstanding. It always knows exactly where I am going and never disappoints when it comes to geocaching. I nearly always have a +- 12 ft radius in a (small) city. Only thing I wish I had was auto-route capabilities, it is annoying marking waypoints for every little curve on the road."
5,Garmin GPS 60CXS,"Great little GPS fairly easy to use, just be patient. I've been using a GPS for the lst 12-13 years and have always had a Magellan. A friend of mine purchased the Garmin and I was impress at the features especially the map updates. You won't be dissapointed."
2,Dead pixels on two separate units,"I am new to GPS handhelds and so far, I haven't had a great deal of luck. Regarding functions of this unit; I haven't yet used it in the field due to problems with two separate units having dead pixels (the first unit had one at the top of the screen and the second one had one in the middle).The build quality aside, I was quite satisfied with the features and overall function of this GPS. As mentioned, I am new to GPS handhelds and I found the 60CSx easy to navigate and to figure out the basics of its use. I was especially impressed with the speed at which it acquired a signal and the speed with which it drew its basemaps.Overall, however, I only give this unit a 2 stars due to having 2 separate units with a screen problem. Something at this price point should have better quality control than this."
4,Think I got a used item,"Bought the 60csx new and the product is what I wanted and expected. Problem: It came in a box with no seals and while I was setting it up I noticed that a name came up that was from GA. Also the unit was already updated to the latest updates and contained a 1 GB storage chip. The unit should have a 64M chip and not updated to the latest software version. This may seem fine but since the unit has been around for a while, how old is it really? My problem now is the $350 I spent on maps. If I return it will Garmin allow me to unlock my maps again for a new unit. If I keep it, was it a refurbished unit? I, in good faith, bought a new unit. Not a used unit. The unit is as advertised. The problem is why pay for new if it's origin is from someone else. Bought from Amazon and disappointed."
4,gps,solid gps; good coverage in heavily forested trails; screen difficult to read in bright sunlight due to glare. basic map marginal; you will need to add a topo map. overall I would recommend and am pleased with product
2,45 days and it's broken,"I boat with this Walkman, so it gets saltwater on it, but otherwise I've treated it pretty gently. The screen died within 3 weeks and now, 6 weeks in, it won't play at all.Also, although the case seems fairly water resistant, the headphone jack isn't protected."
2,DID NOT WORK,"I WAS VERY UP SET THIS WALKMAN WAS A GIFT. IT COST $90.00 6 MONTHS AGO. IT DID NOT WORK RIGHT I COULD NOT GET GOOD RECEPTION AT ALL IT WAS COMPLETE STATIC ON ALL STATIONS. I THINK IT WAS DEFECTIVE BECAUSE I ALWAYS BUY SONY PRODUCTS, AND THEY WORK GREAT I STILL HAVE THE WALKMAN MY GRANDMA GAVE ME 11 YEARS AGO AND IT STILL WORKS. BUYER BEWARE DON'T BUY WALKMANS FROM AMAZON ON LINE. I SUSSPECT AMAZON MAY HAVE SOLD ME SOMEONE'S RETURN ITEM. ALTHOUGH I CAN'T PROVE IT. YOU'LL BE BETTER OFF GOING TO TARGET OR BEST BUY. IN CASE A REFUND IS NEEDED. SHOPPERS CHECK ALL YOUR PURCHASE'S WITH IN A 30 DAY PERIOD SO YOU WON'T GET STUCK WITH SOMETHING THAT DOES NOT WORK. IF I DID THAT I COULD HAVE GOT A FULL REFUNDGOOD LUCK FRIEND"
5,Great Deal!,"What a wonderful CD player!- Nice design with LCD display, buttons on top of the body- Optional hand strap- MP3, Radio play back!- Takes regular AA batteries- Little bit heavy but made with strong plasticPractical CDP I've ever owned."
3,Dub Taylor - Experience,"While it's certainly not a masterpiece, Dub Taylor's second album for Force Tracks, EXPERIENCE, hits its groove and doesn't let up. For the most part, the tracks are catchy, although none have a real ""wow"" factor. Cole Porter, for instance, won't be be suing over ""Under My Skin."" But the addition of vocals gives this album more of an identity over DETECT. ""Sweet Awakening"" has an icy chill to it, while ""Your Soul"" tries to inject some R&B into the air. The Japanese lyrics on ""Ko-Hi-Nomatai,"" however, don't quite mesh with the music itself. ""Flop Recorded Live"" has some more spark to it, although the repetitive lyrics dulls the shine. So while this isn't the shiniest jewel in the tech-house crown, it does manage to stir up a few good tracks."
2,This book not great but averalge,This book was a disappointment. I expected more and it was almost boring. The so-called poker games were barely a factor in the book and her also so -called friends you really never got to know. Jill (the main character) had so issues in her life but there was no connection. Nothing pulled all of this book together. I am finding that even writing a review that describes this book difficult. I wouldn't recommend.
3,written for the rich,to play by this book you must be able to loose quiet few amount of money in regards to playing to profitability this is not a recommended book . this is the type of book that you will want to get together with friends and drink up party and have a good time it's definetly not for the regular poker player this is a must not buy book this is the reason for not given a fours or fifth star
3,Not the worst book I've read......,Well... not the worst. It was slow at the start and got interesting towards the middle/end. I didn't feel that I got close with the characters and I was confused a good part of the time. There were some funny moments and her writing style is interesting - but I wouldn't classify this as a top pick.
2,Stupid Book,"Sorry, this book was so stupid. The character seemed to be an airhead and the author seemed to have a very short attention span. It was an okay story, but I felt like I was reading something along the line of ""See spot run. Dick threw the ball. Jane has a blue dress on."" It appeared to be written by someone who wasn't very intelligent or really was going totally for the laugh and trying to make us think the character was a ditz. It was entertaining, but read it when you really can't put much thought into what you are reading, because you don't need to concentrate to keep in tune with this book. I can imagine her working for the Letterman show, because even though, ""you want some gum"" - which Dave says is totally hilarious, it is really corny. It kind of falls along that line if you like that stuff. I do like Dave, but this book was pretty stupid. Okay, I will give you that it will make you laugh at how stupid the character is."
3,Disjointed Attempt at Chick Lit,"Ruby lands a job in New York to escape a blah relationship in Boston. Her relationships and insecurities provide fodder for her column, ""Single Girl on the Edge/Ledge/Verge."" Her attraction to the editor and her poker nights with her girlfriends set up some funny scenes.The book reads like a series of columns scotch taped together. Maybe that's the intent, but it just feels choppy. The women friends are mere caricatures and Ruby is frustratingly inept in pursuing her romantic interest."
2,Not worth the gamble,"This is a journal/diary, right? It has to be, otherwise the choppy sentences, awful grammar and pointless meanderings of the narrator are just bad writing. The story doesn't flow - mainly because it isn't written in prose, but as a series of diary entries that jump from one subject to the next, and from past to present. The narrator, Ruby Capote, isn't very interesting and neither are her friends. This `poker night' doesn't take place all that often in the book - generally, the entries are about Ruby and her feelings on her life in general. I didn't `feel' anything for Ruby because she didn't `feel' anything for herself - she isn't a very pro-active character and just accepts life as it comes. A non-risk taker as she points out. This was a pretty fast read, but I still feel it was wasted time."
3,Just Another Read,"This book starts out slow, continues slow, and then ends really quick. After a while you start to wonder just who you are reading about and if its worth your time. After finishing the book, I have to be honest and say I enjoyed its quirks and dryish hummor, but to me, it was just another read."
4,Fun and cool book,"This is the kind of I look for:quick, to the point, not too concern about that dreary, dreamy details such as wind blows and the color of the leaves (like many boring books). If you find most of Oprah's selections to be boring (except for ""I know this much is true"" and ""Poisonwood Bible"" :these are my favorite books), you will find this book refreshing and funny. Great for thirty something women like me."
2,Yawn,"Sorry, but this book just didn't do it for me. I would rather plumb deeper into Ruby's pysche (how her father's death has affected her life and relationships) in more detail, than to have little snippits here and there. The book just didn't flow - who really cares if Ruby and Michael get together - you don't get to know enough about them to care."
3,"What you would expect,","Cute but typical for this genre. I guess I need to stop reading 30 -something dating books, should have stopped with B. Jones Diary...."
1,One pathetic excuse for a book,"Why is this book getting so much praise??? It was a waste of money and time. I honestly tried to like this book but it just wasn't possible. I got half way through and stopped, and rarely have I done this with any book. I found it hard to follow, there were no chapters, instead there were entries of random ramblings and complaints about life. The characters were horrible, the writing was bad. Avoid this book at all costs."
1,ughh....,"i had high expectations for this book. i just read the shopaholic series by sophie kisella and was really excited to get into the ""chic lit"" genera and was highly let down by this book. i am the type of person that i can't stand spending $ on a book that i don't finish so i forced myself to plug through the rest of this book. the book is written in such a way that you can't form a connection with any of the characters therefore you don't care what happens in the end. overall it was waste of my $5 and i'd give it no stars if i could."
1,ridiculously overrated,"I'm stunned by the number of people who thought this book was good. The characters were superficial and bland (a selfish model -- shocking!, a ""perfect"" married woman in the Connecticut suburbs -- who'd have thought?!, a handsome editor -- no way!); and the poker nights were a contrivance for a group of girls to pick on each other. The writing was sophomoric if not amateurish. It seemed as if the author (or her editor) threw things in later on (Ruby's father's suicide) to make Ruby sympathetic or interesting. Lesson #1 of writing is show, don't tell. Jill Davis tells you what to think but it doesn't even make sense. I was bored from page 1, but since I was on a six-hour flight with nothing else to read, I plowed through it. Honestly, I'd have been better off sleeping."
1,So bad it was sad.,"This is one of the worst books I've ever wasted time reading. Actually I picked it up at Walmart for under $4 and I can certainly see why it was so cheap. Basically there is no depth to the story and the meager attempt at developing the main character took too long and delivered too little. Basically the book is the disconnected rambling of an insecure, inferiority-complex blighted young girl -- chasing after her boss; boring!!!. A constant stream of sarcasm born out of insecurity and the lack of anything valuable to say, the book just seems to go on but say nothing. I think this got published because of the author's experience working on the Dave Letterman show -- her sarcasm comes off better out of his mouth than it does on the pages of her higly self-absorbed book. If you are over 17 skip this one - the word ""mundane"" would be too complimentary for it."
3,Not as good as I anticipated,"With all the GLOWING reviews this book has recieved I couldn't wait to read it! However, it didn't live up to the hype, for me.This book is about Ruby Capote, a single girl who is dissatisfied with both her column and her boyfriend so she sends her best columns and a six-pack of beer to the NY News editor and lands herself a job in THE BIG CITY. She falls for her boss but will their unresolved pasts sustain the relationship?This is a smart, funny, laugh out loud, upbeat look at love, work and friendship. I genuinely cared for the main character. I liked how it ended.Having said that, I only gave this book 3 stars because it was just OKAY. Read better. Read worse. It wasn't great. It wasn't bad. I would've liked to have seen the characters developed a little more. A little more peak into their pasts maybe would've made it a 5 star read."
4,thirtysomething neurotic rants!,A gift for my thirith birthday this book couldn't have come at a better time! It's a great light hearted quick read that tickles your creative side a bit... loved it!
4,Very funny chick lit,I love Jill A Davis - she is just sooo funny. The story is told by a series of emails between coworkers and friends. Ruby is a lovable character and you will find yourself laughing out loud. I bought this after reading Ask Again Later and will look forward to whatever comes next from Davis!
5,What a relatable character,"Sure, she can be annoying, but I see so much of my own neuroses in Ruby Capote. I love this book -- I even re-read it a few years after the first time. She's real. It's funny and poignant at the same time."
1,A little depressing,"Parts of this book were funny but by the end I felt really depressed and i had a knot in my stomach. It's a sad view of the world and of dating, and I would not recommend it to anyone whose not already dating someone happily or is married. I don't think it is realistic really but it still depressed me."
1,Rip Off!,"Not only is buying this book a rip off, but the so-called humor in it is too. There's a bit in there about the mayor changing the size label on his pants that sounds like it was ripped off from a Seinfield episode.Other than that this story jumps from one thought to the next with no real connection. The attempt at humor doesn't come through and you get the feeling that the writer is pasting together techniques or stories that have run elsewhere, as in Bridget Jones Diary, and Sex in the City. It's a bad attempt at both of those.It's only after a year of writing for her newspaper that one of Ruby's columns is put into the book. The main character only talks about her betting at the poker game near the end of the book after a year of these games. The author's unnerving habit of starting sentences with AND gritted on my nerves to no end.I read the whole book thinking that the ending had to be better then the rest of the book. I was disappointed. Don't waste your time or money on this read."
3,Pass it up,"Though this is a quick read, I don't think it is worth the time. I'm an unmarried, young, city-dweller and I couldn't relate to the main character, Ruby, at all. In addition, there was very little character development. I didn't feel close to any of the characters by the end of the book, nor did I really care about any of them. To me, a great book gets you completely wrapped up in the story line and the characters lives. You won't find that here. This isn't the genre of books I normally read (i.e. young, single girl with problems and little confidence) so maybe that can explain my dissatisfaction. But in my opinion, there are so many excellent books out there, so don't waste your time on this one."
2,Trying too hard and not making it,"I agree with what some others here have said. . This book is TRYING to be Bridget Jones Diary or Sex and the City, but it isn't. I never cared about the characters. The plot was scatter shot. I had a difficult time gauging the flow of time throughout. The whole Girls Poker Night premise is given very brief attention. Over all I thought it was a forgetable book. Towards the end there are some really well written pieces, but not enough to salvage the whole. Over all, this wouldn't be a bad $1 bargain bin purchase if you needed something light for beach or plane reading, but I wouldn't spend money on it, nor would I pass it on to friends."
5,Excellent Novel,"I stumbled across this book in the bookstore and couldn't put it down until I finished it. The main character, Ruby, has a fantastic, quirky sense of humor and some very real insecurities. (And she was all too easy to relate to!) I highly recommend it and I can't wait until Jill Davis writes another one!"
3,No Bridget Jones,"I purchased this book because I thought it would be somewhat similar to Bridget Jones. Well, its really not. Although I like the writer`s flowing style of writing, this book is as far from a romantic comedy as you can get.The author intermingles too many things and we end up having difficulty sorting through it all.I also never felt a deep connection with any of the main characters in this book, especially between the girlfriends.I enjoyed the book, but basically expected it to be a lot more entertaining. This book was very morose."
5,An Awesome Find!,"I happened upon Jill A. Davis' book while browsing at Hastings one day and I can not tell you enough good things about it. Not only is she witty and clever, her book is written in a style that makes it hard to put down. Ruby, the main character, is as quriky and compelling as the company she keeps. I was amused and touched by this book. It is rare for me to laugh out loud when reading, but the story of Ruby, her girlfriends, her love life, her family...it will make you laugh, cry, and think about your own life in a new way. I loved it!"
1,Didn't bother to finish reading this one...,I started this book and was quite excited to read it. I was soon bored to tears and for the first time ever I didn't finish reading a book. If you're going to buy this... I'd go with a used copy and not spend a lot of money. It was disappointing.
2,"i expected more; more laughs, more poker","I would think those who liked Bridget Jones and Sex And the City would NOT like this book. The VOICE of Ruby Capote was DRONE... ZZZZZZ. On the other hand, those who liked GIRLS GUIDE TO FISHING AND HUNTING should like this. Both seem to have the same cynical, unlikable, uninteresting voice. Sorry, had hoped for much more and I am an easy laugher... but this did not make me laugh at all."
2,Disappointing,"Girl's Poker Night looked promising--a fun book with endorsements by some very respected authors. Yet it was extremely disappointing--the writing was mediocre and the plot was unoriginal and derivative. One of the endorsements described it as a cross between Bridget Jones and Sex and the City--it's not a cross, it's a duplication."
5,If you like Sex in the City - This is for you!,"The Journal of Ruby Capote:What an incredible book about the life of Ruby moving from Boston to New York to simply get out of a relationship-but she just didn't up and leave- she goes for a NEW job and falls for Michael- who just so happens to be her boss!Ruby also has to deal with her own emotional turmoil caused by past events in her childhood and now effecting her relationship - BUT who better to help her see her through this emotional ride - - Her friends who get together for their Wednesday night poker games, her shrink, a psychic reader, and a few others along the way.This is an extremely fast read, but a great story. It reminds me of reading a dairy/journal. If you like Sarah Jessica Parker and her girlfriends....you will like this book! So much packed into a short story...highly recommend!"
1,"Bad book, baaaad book","I'm an inveterate, compulsive reader. It's rare that I don't finish a book, but I couldn't finish this one. My biggest criticism would have to be the way it was written, as a series of tiny vignettes, loosely organized chronologically. It reminds me of one of the first papers I wrote in college: I had all this material on my index cards, ran out of time to organize it, and basically just put everything in chronological order and typed it up. That was good for an A- in history, but I expect more careful crafting in a published novel. Like other reviewers here, I found it hard to keep track of the characters because there was little to differentiate them, except for the buffoonish characterization of Skorka, the ESL model. If you want a light, amusing Chick Lit read, try Katie Fforde instead, but give this one a miss."
2,A Skit Collection,"Another one of the books with loved it-hated it reviews. I've tried to read it three times, but I just can't seem to get going. The continual headers every two-three paragraphs are like tiresome stop signs-- they distract, interrupt, and ruin any sense of continuity. Annoying, and meaningless! Either this book has ADD, or the author is so used to writing brief TV skits that writing an entire flowing, cohesive chapter proved to be too much-- and pointing out that fact every two paragrpahs with a new little header is a turn off. It's a library book, so I may give it another try in a few months."
3,Hum Drum,"Ugh. I couldn't get into any of the characters... they reminded me of a group of people who if they asked me to join them I'd get a sick filling in my stomach just from the invite. It is not compelling...they don't do anything interesting, have anything interesting to say, and have no inner lives...it is HUM DRUM"
4,good vacation read,"Enthusiastic Recommend: Girls' Poker Night by Jill DavisGirls' Poker Night is a quick, entertaining read with a kicker. It starts out with brash actions and a frivolous air. Ruby, a humor writer, pitches herself for a job in New York City. She wants out of her current life, including an escape from a boring boyfriend. She gets it.I found it funny right from the start, and was not put off by its apparently thin beginning. Then it solidified, became about something much more engaging and challenging than just a bunch of self-centered young women who are pretty entertaining. But it stayed funny. It was the best of both worlds for me. There was no guilt for reading something that was pure silliness. It made me ponder, but not despair. It made me laugh, but not in a senselessly brainless way. It's a good vacation read."
1,Conair inflatable neck rest,This is worthless. You need a tire pump to blow it up. I called ConAir with my complaint and they will not refund my money - just give me a letter of credit. I think this sucks.Lousy customer service. Diane Sardeson
2,A disappointment,"When I ordered this guide, I was expecting a format that was similar to the other Petersen bird guides. Unfortunately, this book is nowhere near as well organized. The plates are small, the artwork is not as good, and not all the species are illustrated. The text was also rather thin in life history information. If you are traveling to the Caribbean in winter and aren't up to speed on North American migratory singbirds, you will need to take an Eastern U.S. bird guide with you as well, as the numerous migrants that comprise the wintertime fauna are merely mentioned. I managed to identify most birds that I saw while using this guide, but it was a frustrating process."
4,West Indy Birds,"Yea, The book could definently use some improvements, but overall the pictures did depict the birds pretty well. The only species illustrated {in color} are those endemic ONLY to the Carib islands. Any birds that are seen in the continental US are only given black and white drawings, and small descriptions. So a field guide and familiarity to eastern migratory birds are a plus! I am VERY dissapointed with the quality of the pages in the book. After a week in the Islands, mine looks worse than any of my regular guides! Bring a water-proof sleeve or something, because it's going to get wet! Not a bad book though, I had a lot of fun, and pretty much every bird you see tends to be a new species! Have fun!"
2,Not for on-the-fly IDs,"I traveled to the West Indies in November on a cruise with my wife. I brought along this field guide, specifically purchased to help us identify birds I saw on the trip. Sadly, Petersen Field Guides, while perfectly fine bird books, are lousy for quick identification in the field. I highly recommend instead either a Golden Guide or an Audubon Field Guide. I've heard very good things about the Stokes' field guides, but have not used them myself - yet.Very disappointed; really wish I'd have gone with a different book."
5,I love it,I only wish I would have found this a long time ago. It's exactly what I've been searching for. thanks you
5,Great quality at a good price,"My expectations have been met. Very authentic, quality material and good workmanship. This is obviously the official NBA jerzey."
2,dissapointing,"I was hoping it was a cute story. But it is the history lesson for Halloween, and some of it was too much for my little kids and some of it got boring. Not what I expected at all. Definately not the kids favorite movie."
2,"Great Book, Bad Format: Appears Sideways","I have no problem with the book. The problem is with the formatting of this particular one. You can't change the background color, font size, and (most importantly) it appears sideways. If it were not for the latter, I would not have written a review. My advice: buy a physical copy of the book. It's something you will want to have in your library 20 years from now."
5,I was pleased,I was very pleased in the timly manner that the book came. The condition was excellent and as it was described by the seller.
3,not for beginners,"the book is intended for people who already play the fiddle and would like to play bluegrass. with this qualifacation out of the way, I liked the book."
4,"Teach yourself the style, not the instrument","I like this book very much, but I can already read music. Also, I can already play the violin with some proficiency. This would be a horrible book to try to start with if you didn't have fiddle experience, but in terms of getting a feel for bluegrass music when you come from a classical background, I think it's very effective. I would recommend it as an introduction to the style, not to the instrument itself."
2,"""TEACH YOURSELF"" IS THE KEY","A NICE COLLECTION OF BLUEGRASS TUNES, AND A GREAT ACCOMPANYING CD TO PLAY ALONG-- BUT YOU BETTER BE A RATHER ACCOMPLISHED FIDDLER BEFORE YOU TRY THESE TUNES--- DEFINITELY NOT FOR THE BEGINNER"
3,Title a bit misleading,"The title and it's description is misleading. The first part of the book states something along the lines that ""This book is intended for those who have played violin and want to start playing bluegrass"" I started playing fiddle just a few months ago with an instructor and purchased this book to help me along. I'm not interested in learning sheet music (nor is my instructor the kind who teaches it), more so just back porch picking. This wasn't the book for me."
4,"Classic Brazilian pop, however...","Be forewarned that this disc is actually a best-of collection, and not a reissue of the album ""Com Azucar Com Afeto,"" from 1980, which was a tribute to songwriter Chico Buarque. Same title, different songs."
2,Bad Quality,"The music is good, but the CD quality is extremely bad. It seems to be recorded from a LP and you can hear the scratch sounds throughout"
4,Imported Music,"If you like music that you don't hear on radio, check this out. I made his CD part of my ""Exotic Music"" collection."
3,Dated,"A fast-paced dramatic read a la the ""old school,"" the book is dated now and readers should see Buchanan's THE ROAD TO GUILFORD COURTHOUSE instead."
5,Good copy,"This review is simply to state that the current MGM DVD (2003) of ""Zulu"" will satisfy most of the people who have enjoyed this film. It is in wide-screen format (but can be played in box-screen if desired), uncut (not like a VHS copy I bought at Walmart!) and, yes, in monoral sound.If anyone has a better copy available in VHS or DVD, please let us know..."
5,A CLASSIC WAR EPIC.,"Zulu tells the story of the true story of a regement of British troops who sucessfully defened Rorke's Drift from Zulu warriors 40 to 1 odd's. Micheal Caine and Stanley Baker head the cast in this terrific war film. Micheal Caine shines as the young aristocrat who is forced to bravery by extreme measures. Great battle scenes, great score and great acting. Zulu is a classic, one to own and cherish."
5,From a military standpoint it is a Great Movie,"Zulu is action packed, and from a military persepctive shows the futility of the frontal assault. From an entertainment viewpoint, it is an action packed film and my personal favoritd. END"
2,What??? NO Extras????,"On the UK Paramount DVD release there are some truly wonderful extras. For some bizarre, inexplicable reason the extras been excluded from this version. This was one of the most popular British films ever made but, typically, due to the fact that it didn't become a huge hit in the States, it gets a rather shabby, pitiful DVD release.Shame on you MGM."
1,ZULU A DVD DISASTER,"I have seen some pretty cruddy tapes and dvds in my time but for sheer waste of time and money this is the top. The picture is totally pox with colours changing, blacks being anything from charcoal to brown and a degradation of picture that makes the movie unpleasent to watch. I have retrieved my VHS tape from the friend I gave it to (he was good enough to give it back) and the DVD is now in a landfill somewhere, or better yet burried at a cross-roads with a wooden stake driven through it's heart!"
1,missing,I love this move. The problem with this dvd is like another pearson I saw here the first 35 minutes of the movie are missing from the dvd.
1,Don't Point that Dodgy DVD at Me!,"Zulu. One of the finest war films ever made. So what has gone wrong here? I suppose I should have realized when the photographs on the cover have Michael Caine dressed in a sports jacket and poor Jack Hawkins is dressed as a Roman. This low-quality DVD really is an insult. The colour is well below standard, and the image quality is truely awful. Save your money Zulu fans, and buy the VHS instead - the print is far superior. What a mistake..."
1,This Blu Ray version is the worst Blu Ray I've ever purchased,"First, let me state I love this movie and consider it a 5 star film. This blu ray, however, is deplorable. No top menu or pop up menu, no supplements, and no subtitles would make this a bad disc, but believe it or not, this disc doesn't even let you pause, rewind or fast forward. There are no Chapters you can scan through. That's right. When you start the movie, you better be ready to watch it straight through without even a bathroom break. NO PAUSE! No rewind to see what you've missed. I feel royally hipped. Picture quality is okay, but I would rather have the DVD and be able to pause."
5,Girls can love this movie too!,"I have always enjoyed this movie since I was a little girl. At 27 I love it even more. The gentleman behavior of the English, the breathtaking battle sequences and the fantastic score are spectacular. I have my favorite characters that just send shivers up my back and tears to my eyes at times for their heroism. If you don't take my word for how great this movie is you can refer to Lord of the Rings Two Towers extras. Peter Jackson was inspired by a few of the scenes from Zulu for the beginning of the battle at Helm's Deep."
1,Two Defective DVD's in a Row,"ZULU has always been a movie favorite of mine. When I saw it on Amazon, I immediately jumped at the chance to purchase it. Arriving in late March 2000, the DVD was defective - skipping from scene to scene. At such a bargain price, I didn't bother to write Amazon. Today (4-8-00) I purchased ZULU from a retail store. Once again, a defective DVD. All other DVD's work well. While the movie is one of the best action films made, it seems this DVD version was made too cheaply to be viewable. Hope others have better luck."
1,Review of the DVD,Brilliant Film! Awful DVD. I have seen this film in the cinema and on the TV and the DVD destroys the brilliant photography of the original. If you like stilted jumpy action and reduced bandwidth sound which make the DVD almost unwatchable then buy this! This looks and sounds as if it was processed using a 486 computer!
4,Troma Version Getting Warmer,I just finished watching this Troma version of Zulu. It is NOT anamorphic so the setting on my widescreen made the picture a tad grainy but it's the best DVD version so far. They picked the best print they could find I'm sure (pretty decent) but no effort was made to perfect it. At least I can replace my video version of this film with confidence and at THIS price it's a real bargain.
3,"Great Movie, Below Average Bluray","I was hoping for a better digital version of Zulu, but it is the VHS version just transferred to a disc. Very disappointing that the producers, of the disc, took a high level digital disc and put a bad analog transfer onto it."
3,Great movie but poor DVD,"Zulu is an excellent movie. It contains good acting, great scenery, an interesting plot, and lots of action with a minimum of gore. I would recommend it to almost anyone. The DVD is of poor quality. The widescreen version that I have seen on PBS stations is of considerably better quality and makes the film much more spectacular. I recommend the film highly, but perhaps the widescreen VHS is a better choice than this DVD. Definitely a high quality widescreen DVD would be the best."
5,Defective DVD Copy,The move is 5 stars. I have purchased 3 different copies of the Diamond DVD and all 3 have the same problem. The 1st approx 34 mins. are not on the DVD.
1,Great Movie -- Horrible Transfer,"""Zulu"" is a classic and deserves far better treatment than this! Drop outs, frozen frames, skips, video and audio distortion . . . this DVD has it all. Hopefully Criterion will soon step in and do this film justice with a decent transfer."
5,Zulu,"This is perhaps the one of the best war films ever made. Despite what people may say it was based upon real events and reflected them reasonably accurately.Chard and Bromhead were both interesting Characters. In reality both were relatively old for their respective ranks and it could be considered that they had both been overlooked and left behind at Rourke's Drift by the Main Briish force as it was considered an unimportant position. However both were professionally trained and this together with the profesionalism of the other soldiers is what allowed them to succesfully defeat 4000 zulus.The film does not glorify War, but does aknowledge the courage, attention to duty and camaraderie of the people taking part. A small point but to other reviewers - the soldiers taking part were predominantly Welsh, and not English - There is an important difference"
2,never mind the tinman hand-to-hand once those Zulus do get there,"Michael Caine in his first big job. a big 'war epic', in the trailer they even said 'DWARFING THE MIGHTIEST!' it's about these 100something moody, sweaty British soldiers who fought off 4,000 Zulu warriors. the first eternity/hour+ of the movie is just spent moping around the fort, waiting for something to happen while the Englishmen in red felt stack up sacks of corn around the perimeter, and a lot of ""dammit"" and ""good old boy"" going on. anyway pretty ridiculous.actually, the Zulus do take on a 3rd dimension for the wedding/dance scene at the beginning, but spare yourself the remaining 2 hours."
3,Basically an Anti-War Movie,"Zulu is basically more of an antiwar movie than an action adventure flick. War is not glamorized in Zulu and it is shown in all its horrific repulsiveness. Nor for that matter are there any heroes in Zulu for nobody acts heroically. The officers and soldiers know that its likely that they will die defending their isolated frontier outpost against the Zulu hordes and they are bitterly resentful of that fact.This makes Zulu an original and different movie. However, the quality of the acting is generally low, although Michael Caine delivers a splendid performance. The script, direction and special effects are also deficient. Zulu was made on a low budget and it shows.Zulu is an example of how a great idea does not necessarlily result in a great movie."
1,ZULU,"This was another one sided attempt at promoting white/Europeon supremacy. I realize that the film is old and the screenwriter was not thinking of historical or political correctness, but of a ""feel good"" movie for white folks. As an African American, I feel it was degrading to Africans because it, as with most films, failed to properly develop the them as characters, human beings and most of all soldiers. Sadly another opportunity to tell a true story was missed, and the medium had its own message."
1,5 Star Film - No Star DVD,"This is my favourite film of all time. However if, like me, you are tempted to buy this DVD from the USA as it is unavailable in the UK - don't bother. The other negative reviews on this site are quite correct. The picture and sound quality compare to a cheap copy of an old VHS. If you love this film as I do, you'll be disappointed and frustrated. Save your money.***Zulu now has a release date in the UK of June 2002****"
1,"Great film, rotten DVD","Every one agrees the film is something special, but unfortunately this DVD is not. The DVD might boast ""fully restored and digital masters"", and be the widescreen edition, but unfortunately the picture is badly pixelated and blurred so I have to wonder why they even bothered remastering it. It's not surprising the picture is bad considering that this is a single-sided, single-layer non anamorphic disc. There are also zero extras worth mentioning. Caveat Emptor."
1,"Great Film, Awful DVD",An excellent film that I have seen many times on TV in widescreen. Unfortunately I bought it on DVD without checking it out first (that'll teach me). The main problem is the picture and sound quality which in DVD format I'd expect it to be better than video which this DVD certainly is not. It looks like it has been filmed with a cheap webcam infront of a TV. The moral of this text is don't waste your money on this DVD.
4,A film that deserves better ...,"I would have given this DVD five stars if they had only maintained the theatrical aspect ratio ... this is a truly awesome film with a compelling story, excellent acting and glorious cinematography - that gets totally lost in this full-screen version.At $6, for what you get - the movie, a trailer, dolby stereo, and the cropped pan-and-scan picture - , the price is about right (and it is nice having at least this copy at home). But a well-transferred wide-screen version (with maybe a 5:1 surround? Commentary?) would be a bargan at four or five times the price.We can only hope that someone like Criterion is working on putting out a definitve version of this outstanding film."
1,"This may not be it, but...","...it's out there somewhere! I'm watching the movie on AMC-channel right now and I can't get over how clean and crisp this picture is! Last year when it was on TV it was dark and grainy and I was afraid it was ruined for ever. I have a VHS which is the same: horrible! Please, Amazon.com-folks...get the good version that AMC's playin' now! PLEEEASE!"
2,Home Entertainment = cheap DVDs???,"Two star rating is only for the Home Entertainment release.Otherwise this is a fantastic 4 or 5 star film. See the otherreviews. I am warning about the Home Entertainment release. Audiois AM radio quality while the orchestral score absolutely requiresmultichannel high fidelity. Or better. Video quality is soft; itlooks ok through an RF adapter on a 19"" TV, but I think anyonewith high quality equipment will probably be very disappointed.I got it for a dollar less than five bucks and now have to buy thestudio release; don't know if I would even give it away. Probablyshould be destroyed."
2,Story great; product poor - old VHS tape,The old tape was in very poor condition. Lots of flicker. Did manage to save in digital but the flickering causes a poor result.
5,One of the greatest war movies ever made...,"This is an exceptional film: story, acting, direction, cinematography, music, dialog.... It takes its place along the other war film greats: ""Paths of Glory,"" ""Ballad of a Soldier,"" ""The Cranes Are Flying,"" ""Forbidden Games."" The other reviews do an excellent job of describing the plot, so I'll leave that be.My only question has to do with how this version was cut. I actually saw a VHS version of the film which cut out a lot of the non-action scenes, which are essential to the fact that this movie is actually anti war. I guess I'll have to get the dvd to find out.I also wish that Amazon would be clear about the differences in the different versions they sell."
3,A bit disappointed,"I had heard that this movie is a classic, but I was disappointed in the plot. The movie drags in many points and the opening doesn't grab the audience. However, the picture is crisp and the scenery beautiful."
5,History made and re-told with style..,"This is a brilliant, gripping and involving film that excites and enlightens at the same time. It is Michael Caine's first major role and his performance, combined with that of the fantastic Stanley Baker, make this film a true classic. The quality of the conversion is less than perfect, but it is an involving piece and the fact that it actually happened makes it all the more thrilling. The heroism and 'guts' of the 150 soldiers, faced with over 4,000 Zulus, more than comes across and thrills all the way! If you like historical war films, this is an example of true 19th century heroism that has never been bettered."
5,One of few BD discs that does not let you down,"This Is a film so improved with the BD transfer I'm compelled to let others know. Many times I've wished that a certain film would be released, then when it is I'm disappointed, this is not one of them. While watching I found my eyes drawn to the strangest things like the blades of tall grass waving in the breeze. I love this movie and what this transfer does for it (I just can't say enough) Laud the studio for this one, it is superior."
5,Awesome video,"This is the best Blu-ray disc I have seen yet. I was blown away with the picture, it really does justice to the movie which I have probably seen ten times."
5,"Fabulous movie, fantastic in blu-ray","ZULU has been around for a long time and is a wonderful movie, and in Blu-Ray it is absolutely amazing."
1,Great Film even with major inaccuracies,"There are numerous Reviews that tell us a great deal of the story of Rorke's Drift, and some detail a number of the film's careless historical handling of that epic event. One is the inclusion of the drunken Lutheran Missionary and his daughter, who were never there.It is a pity that the film fails to mention one of the real heroes of Rorke's Drift - the Padre. According to contemporary accounts, the Rev Smith was as inspiration as he ran from man to man, carrying ammunition, roaring encouragement and powerful biblical texts. Back in Britain, he was known as one of the heroes of Rorke's Drift, and was 'mentioned in despatches.'He became known as 'Ammunition Smith' because of the stirling work he did, handing out the ammunition. He was depicted as a very large, red-bearded man, slightly wild in appearance, in a painting of the seige."
2,What a shame,"Purchased this DVD and discovered it had horrible skipping problems. After taking it back, Suncoast exchanged it for another copy which had the same problem. This disk will not play on the Toshiba SD-3109 dual tray player.The movie tells the story of a British engineering unit that gets surrounded by a Zulu army in Africa. Zulu is very accurate historically going so far as to show the need for the Zulu to close with short spears. With its fine acting it definitely is one of the better war movies available.I would suggest the reader to tape this one from the History channel or buy it on VHS."
3,"Great movie, terrible DVD","One of my favorite movies since I was eight. After having seen it a half dozen times recently on AMC, I thought I would buy the DVD. At six bucks, I thought how could I lose? But don't waste it. This DVD is an awful rendition. Not only is not letterboxed (which I knew when I bought it), but the video quality is sub-par. Worst of all is the sound quality, which is tinny. The magnificent soundtrack is destroyed by this version.Do yourself a favor and tape the letterbox version off AMC."
3,Where is the stereo sound?,"ZuluI am a big fan of the film Zulu, and have owned copies on VHS, laser disc and DVD. This newest edition has the best video of any release, but there is no stereo sound. Even a 6.99 off-brand edition I found a couple of years ago in a bargain bin had stereo sound as did the Criterion laser disc, so the tracks exist. Historical spectacles, especially 70 mm efforts such as Zulu (with a John Barry score no less), loose much of their impact in mono. To at last release a quality wide screen edition of this film but do so lacking its stereo tracks is a questionable decision for a major distributor like MGM."
5,ZULU,"THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF MY ALL TIME MOVIES. IT IS A CONTINUATION OF ZULU DAWN. I BELIEVE THIS IS MICHAEL CAINES FIRST MOVIE. HE DOES A VERY GOOD JOB. IN THE MEEN TIME 4000 ZULUS ARE HEADED THEIR WAY TO TAKE CARE OF THIS SMALL CONTINGENT OF 175 MEN OR SO. A NONSTOP, SOMETIMES HAND TO HAND COMBAT THAT NEVER SEEMS AS THOUGH IT WILL END. I THINK IT IS WAY BETTER THAN ZULU DAWN. I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT."
5,Great Film in Great Form,"I have loved Zulu since I saw it at the drive-in as a child. Finally, in Blue-ray, an excellent transfer is available where you can see the colors and details that enhance the viewing experience far better than previous releases. I was weary of ordering, because the information was ambiguous as to whether it was for this region, and the label was unfamiliar to me. Rest assured, it will be one of the best purchases you can make in the quest for excellent classic films."
2,Great movie; bad audio,"Zulu is one of my favorite films of all time, so I was eager to get hold of a DVD that would display it in all its wide-screen glory. Unfortunately, the soundtrack to this version is so faint that even when I turn the volume on my TV up all the way, I still have trouble hearing all the dialog is anyone else is making any noise in the room. I may try the Platinum Disc Corp. version and see if it's any better."
5,A Great Film,"Like so many other fans of this film, I fell in love with it as a kid. When I saw it again years later, I was amazed by how well it held up. The mostly true story of 140 British holding their own against 4000 Zulus is gripping, and the Zulus are both majestic and poignant, but the best thing about the film is its brilliant realization of some unforgettable characters, among them Nigel Green's unflappable Colour-Sargeant Bourne, Michael Caine's foppish Lt. Bromhead, and, best of all, James Booth's smoulderingly rebellious Pvt. Hook. Zulu is a funny, gritty, and intelligent portrayal of an amazing historical event. The spectacular displays of courage throughout the battle scenes, and the spirit of universal brotherhood evoked by the surprise ending, create a strong atmosphere of moral beauty, making Zulu an uplifting and inspiring experience."
4,And Put Your Tunic ON!,"One of the greatest films put on DVD. Yeah there are many historical inaccuracies, but still a fantastic movie. Readily available, nicely shipped, good price."
5,Excellent film - historically accurate!,"This is one of the best films of its genre to come along in many a time. Well-produced, with very fine performances by Stanley Baker and Michael Caine in particular. It presents the defence of Rorke's Drift by a small detachment of British soldiers in a most historically accurate manner. An excellent addition to anyone's video collection. (Viewers might find it interesting to know that no less than eleven of the defenders, including the ""slacker"" Henry Hook, were recipients of the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest award ""for conspicuous bravery ... in the presence of the enemy"")."
5,TWO DISC ZULU SPECIAL EDITION,"This is one of the best war films ever made and on this DVD you have the added bonus of an informative documentary that explains all you could need to know about it's making.What comes across from watching this documentary is that ZULU is Stanley Baker's film. He was the star and producer. Without Stanley there would have been no Michael Caine. Without Stanley there would have been no ZULU.So to my point: Why is Michael Caine solely brandished on the front of the DVD box cover art? His name is the only one that is mentioned. Have the movie going public forgotten Stanley Baker? I mean, he only made 115 movies! Michael Caine was an unknown when Stanley Baker cast him.I feel this does an injustice to the film as a whole. I would like to see a little more respect shown to the creator of this film. As Chief Buthelezi said when Stanley died - ""He was the best white man I ever knew."""
1,Zulu on DVD,"First off let me say that I absolutely LOVE ""Zulu"" however I was greatly disappointed with the latest DVD version.First of all there was no insert with the case. Would it have killed MGM to provide some additional background information on the film?Second, and most importantly, the sound quality is PATHETIC.This DVD is presented in Mono and the whole thing sounds as if you are trying to listen to it underwater.A truly shabby treatment of a great film. MGM should be ashamed.Personally I suggest sticking to the VHS version until a better DVD becomes available.This one was a waste of time and money."
5,"""A fine war film...""","Bursting with action, ""Zulu"" can easily be considered a fine war film. Personally, I feel it is one of the best of its kind.Set against beautiful Africa vistas, ""Zulu"" guides the audience through a small British garrison that's in the process of being beseiged by thousands of bloodthirsty Zulu warriors. However, the Brits don't budge an inch, for they are well-disciplined. The Zulus respond with constant attacks(in the form of wonderfully-filmed action sequences), hoping to break the spirit of their enemy. What follows is an exciting look into events with historical significance.This was, I believe, Michael Caine's first film, and he does well as Lieutenant Bromhead. Stanley Baker, who produced and acted, is equally good as his superior officer.The DVD version of this film does not represent ""Zulu"" with any bonus features, save the theatrical trailer. On the other hand, the picture is good and the sound is fine. Certainly better than the VHS version."
3,Mediocre DVD,"I actually found a widescreen DVD of this movie (from Front Row Entertainment)around Christmastime. This DVD is actually letterboxed to a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. However, the quality is so-so. The picture is slightly blurry and the color is somewhat faded, but it's worth it for the widescreen cinematography."
2,"Half fiction, porn, action","A lot of the film is Hollywood dream. It's based on the facts of an astounding British victory, distorted for entertainment's sake. The real life minister at whose station the battle took place, was nothing like the psycho in the movie, with a noble, attractive daughter; who actually was two years old at the time, and no where near the battle. Early in the film there is a long scene of massed Zulus dancing, nearly naked, males and females; accurate, but porn. The scenes of Zulus and Red Coats battling were good. The actual facts are easily obtainable by Googling the battle of Rorke's Drift."
2,Superb movie... but wait for a higher quality DVD,"I am an avid fan of this classic movie. The quality of the DVD's production though, is nothing short of abysmal. The picture often freezes or becomes heavily pixelated. What makes matters worse is that these problems most commonly occur during the epic fighting scenes! In short this is a fantastic movie but wait for it to be remastered and re-released."
3,Good film bad DVD,"This is a great movie but the DVD does nothing for the film. If your thinking of buying this you should know the film is not widescreen also it looks like the transfer was done on a home PC. The quality of this release is little better than a video cd, the picture is washed out and really shows its age. There is no making of or special features which would add to this DVD. The price is cheap as is the quality, if you want a good copy of this film you will have to wait for the UK region 2 release."
5,A historical gem,"This film is the absolute classic war movie. It has been the inspiration for many other movies, including the attack on Helm's Deep in Peter Jackson's ""The Two Towers."" As a historical incident it is fascinating. The battle of Rorke's Drift shows just how one-sided the encounter could be between industrial warfare and the courage and skill of African warriors. Africa contained no more warlike tribe than the Zulus. If you think this has nothing to do with today's Africa, you're wrong."
5,Zulu Purchase,"One of my favorite movies from years past. Filmed in Africa using and I believe using actual tribal members (1964). Seems like I'd never catch the very beginning of the movie so I thought I'd order it. Now, I can use the closed caption and understand all that is going on and watch it again whenever I want. Very good movie, especially being Michael Caines first movie."
4,The good 'ol days,"In the process of rebuilding my John Denver collection, it was great seeing this album again. I had it when it was on vinyl. Yes, folks, there was such a thing as old fashioned records. When I first bought this album in '76 I think it was, I played this album every year until the poor thing warped around 1984. For me at least, Denver takes the schmalz out of Christmas songs. After I finish collecting other Denver albums on these new fangled CD's, I'm going to buy this and remember the good 'ol days."
5,My favorite Christmas album ever done.,"What a great album. Aspenglow is my favorite track on the album,Christmas for Cowboys is next. John's voice is so clear and precise that listening to this album is a symphony to your ears."
1,Sony Legacy CD reissue does not play properly,"I ordered the most recent reissue of the album on the Sony Legacy label (SKU078636764122) and was immediately disappointed! After the opening song (""Aspenglow"") plays, the first three seconds of the second song start to play before the track indicator changes. In other words, if you decide to skip ahead to track #6 (""Christmas For Cowboys""), you'll miss the first three seconds of the song. This is because those three seconds appear at the end of track #5.This appears to be a disc mastering error. I tried playing this CD in several players - with the same result. I don't know if this problem has been observed in previous CD releases of this album. I downloaded the album from iTunes, and it plays perfectly."
4,Reminds Me of Christmas!,I really like this as a cassette when I was little. After ordering this it brings back great memories and it will always sound great compared to my cassette.
4,Great holiday listening,"John Denver has a nice mix of songs, both old standbys and some country. Theguitar playing is, as always, excellent."
3,OK,I love this CD of John Denver and I have it in 8 track but this CD was not quite right as it paused in the middle of a song and I did not care for that. It is hard to sing along with when they do that.
5,Almost Perfect,"If not for that one song, the one most people skip over (""Please Daddy Don't Get Drunk This Christmas""), this would be THE perfect Christmas CD."
3,So-So Christmas cd.,"There were several really good songs, and a bunch of silly songs that I didn't care for. Would have liked a more ""traditional"" christmas mix."
3,Boring CD,"When I found this book & CD on Amazon I was excited because I attend yoga classes at my gym, but I was really seeking to have some ""quiet time"" with God in the process of all that wonderful stretching. I read through the book & was excited to put in the cd. When I did, I was dissapointed. I was expecting nice music or the narrator reading some of the scripture mentioned in the book, etc. Instead there was NO music, No scripture, and not an adequate amount of time to let you get a complete stretch or concentrate on something other than moving your arm to the next position. Bottom line, if you're looking for a good audio yoga CD that focuses on God & streching with some nice relaxing music - this is not for you. BUT if all you are looking for is a Christian yoga book with very basic stretches & a couple of scripture references - this book/CD is for you."
4,5 Stars If Beginner,"I would have rated this book 5 stars except for the phrase in the publisher's description that said it was ideal for ""advanced practitioners."" I'm not exactly advanced since I still can't do lotus, but I have practiced for a few years and so all of the postures were very introductory to me.That being said, the book greatly enhanced my practice because of the encouragement and direction from the author for incorporating Christian faith and nearness to God in one's practice. The thoughts for meditation offered during the relaxation phase were deep and beautiful and worth the cost of the book. So, it is ""ideal for advanced practioners"" if what you're looking for is direction for Christ-centering your practice.The text portions offer lots of options for doing the stretches/poses, which makes this an especially good book for anyone with physical limitations (or beginners). It's also an excellent book for anyone desiring to develop a Christ-centered yoga practice."
5,educational,"I've almost completed the book. It highlighted some things that I had thought about some years ago, but it was nice to have had someone else who shared a similar view. It's helped my study in my personal worship of Yahweh"
4,18 hr playtex bra,"I like playtex bras how it give support for large breast women. However, after so many washes it looses their support to keep up your breast."
5,Great Support,This product provides great support. It also helps to alleviate back strain and the wide straps increase the comfort level across your shoulders. I highly recommend this product.
5,Playtex Womens 18 Hour Bra.,"The Bra is excellent. Have used them before. Will not use any other. Long lasting, and well fitting. Washes well by hand. Love it."
1,Not What it Seems,"At first sight I thought the bra was nice so I ordered it in blue. However, once it arrived it was what I call the Madonna look or the cone pointy look. So thanks to Amazon's great return policy I returned it for another style."
5,Awesome deal!,"I have a hard time finding these only one I can use and these were inexpensive and came really fast. Thanks, would buy again!"
3,"Product good, maybe not for me","I like the comfortable straps and the supportive nature of the bra, my only real complaint is that the cups tend to come to a point making you look somewhat like a 50's catalog picture."
5,Made for busty gals,The bra looks like it came from the Mrs Doubtfire collection but it truly provides ultimate support for busty women. I am a 34 DD and have difficulty finding a bra that can go the distance. It straps you in as though you are ready for launch but with it's padded straps and wide band keeps me comfortable 12 hours or more. The price is also right. True to size I am definitely buying some more.
2,A whole lot of bra!,"This bra is made of industrial strength elastic and I agree with another reviewer who said the sizes are inconsistent. Another reviewer mentioned how pointy the cups are--I agree with that also. Makes me look like one of those women in an old Perry Mason episode with breasts which look like weapons. In any case, it reminds me of a bra from the 40s or 50s when bras and panties and girdles and underwear were called ""foundations."" It will outlast me and go to my heirs, I'm sure. I bought the black one which is very stiff (even after washing) and it's so heavy and thick it feels like I'm wearing another shirt. Not my idea of comfort."
2,"SERIOUS support for ""the girls""","I felt like my 44D boobs were being herded into industrial-style containers. Wow, it definitely supports them, and they'd better not ask questions!!!I went around all day feeling like my boobs were 'out there', well-managed, and not going anyplace.It's not something I'd buy again - it's just a bit too uncomfortable - like they were stitched from the same material used to make backpacks, but the one I have will probably last a good while.2 stars because it is indeed well-constructed. SOMEBODY at Playtex said, by golly, I wanna design a bra that MEANS it!"
5,"Very Supportive, Pretty- Some Caveats","I have always struggled with finding a good bra since I have a larger chest size. This bra is great. It is very supportive throughout the day, no sagging. The straps don't slip. Two caveats: It can make your breasts look a little pointy and smaller. I'm in my early thirties with a baby, so I'm past caring that my breasts look a little smaller and less round. I want support and comfort! It's still a pretty bra, though. Also, it is a little tight and leaves marks, but again, with looser bras, I didn't get the support, so I'll accept the trade off."
4,good product good price,it is a good price for good product. I really thr the straps for heavy breasted woaman an important feature.
4,Pleasantly excited!,"I was surprised that this bra even fit me! I am rather large-chested and I usually have to go to a specialty bra shop to purchase my bras. I decided to give this bra a chance because of the price, because of the fact it would save me a trip to the usual shop and because of other reviews I read. This bra really is a nice bra and it fits great. My ONLY issue with this bra is that it doesn't ""lift"" my ""ladies"" as well as I would like or as well as a bra should. However, I would TOTALLY purchase another one of these bras! :)"
5,Great price,This is a good price compared to other places that I priced these bras. They are they same as the one I've bought at another merchant.
5,Playtex,Excellent product. Even for the well endowed woman. The support of the bra is always reliable and they last long.
5,rated A-one,it is the only bra i like I have been wearing them for years and they last after many repeated washes
3,Playtex bra,The price was good for a brand name and I ordered the sized I always wear. I found that this bra runs a little large compared to other brands. The quality is good.
5,It's a bra,"Playtex, they make the best large bust bra bar none. As a bonus I save money by buying it at Amazon.com"
2,Good if you're breasts are torpedos,"I'm not one to brag, but my breasts are perfectly round DDs. This bra turned shaped them into long pyramids with extra room around the nipple. I looked so weird in a shirt and even my boyfriend was politely not into it. The bra was pretty comfortable aside from that but I would never buy this again."
3,Its alright!,"Well, this bras does without a doubt make my chest smaller (which as a 42G, makes me happy), the straps are AWSOME along with the support! However...I do not love the ""CONE"" look and the rest of my breast went into the sides of my bra, so they are not sexy from the side!"
2,uncomfortable,Yes the straps are comfortable and it has decent support but the bra itself is so rough underneath my breasts as well as my entire midsection that it leaves marks and literally hurts. If you loosen it to the last hook setting then it's not worth wearing.Don't buy. Seriously.
1,"Dear God, NO!","if it were possible to give a negative star rating, i would. COMPLETELY disappointed by this bra. ordered in 36DD and after it finally arrived (almost 2 weeks later), i balked at the sight of it. within minutes of opening it, i was already preparing it for return to Amazon. straps are HU-monguous--so thick i thought it was the 50s again. bra extends down to middle of my torso, and the cups aren't flush with your chestbone as it should be for a correct fit. itchy lace border. on and on and on.... learn from my lesson & try VF (cheaper) or Olga (great support but with straps that someone under the age of 70 would actually wear)!"
5,it does hold you up,"it sure does hold you up i wear underwires(38dd) and when i opened this up i thought no way is this going to do the trick i will just wear it around the house, washed it dryed it put it on and wow it does hold up- very well- better then the playtex underwire i was wearing, good job playtex nowire"
3,tucks without much lift,"ok, so the bra fits nice, minor inconvenience with the straps. If you aren't looking to lift them up as high as an underwire - than this is for you. While this is great weekends I would prefer one that lifts and separates more. However, for the price it will do just fine.1.24.12 - I put this through the wash after one wearing and now the bottom elastic keeps rolling up causing painful marks. did it shrink?"
3,not made for bigger shoulders,"this bra is pretty comfortable, but the shoulder straps do not extend enough to fit the bigger woman. if you have bigger shoulders, be aware that the straps will only extend enough to get it on and your boobs will be pretty high, almost completely even with your armpits. also, its not very comfortable after the first 6-8 hours. the fabric goes kind of high in the front, so if you do a lot of moving and leaning over, expect a red looking rash on your chest from the fabric rubbing."
4,No choice of colors,"I love the bra and especially the price; however, I really wanted the beige color but wasn't available. Maybe later."
5,Best Supporting Role,"Thankfully a reasonably priced bra for women who need larger cup sizes. Good fit, true to sizing, consistently the same. You may look like a grandmother in a sensible undergarment -- but if nobody's going to be looking at your matronly bras, they are the most comfortable I've found."
3,OK,"The comfort straps on this bra are great but the cups are a little too ""outfront"" for me. I wear a DD and wish the cups were a bit wider. I really wish I could find Playtex style 4170 as that was the most comfortable bra I've ever had."
4,It really is comfortable!,My shoulders thank you... Love the padding which helps lessen the pressure on my shoulders. But make sure you know your correct size before you buy it :)
2,it fit - but it broke after one wash!,"The plastic thing that you use to adjust the strap broke - I can't wear it and don't know how to repair it -- and since I've already worn/washed it, I can't return it.I gave it a couple of stars because it did fit well..."
5,Comfort bra,The product was in excellent condition and fitted as well as did previous pruchases of the same type of bra.
4,Good quality for the price.,"This is probably one of the best bras I've owned. I like the wider straps. They don't dig into my shoulders. The material is smooth enough to wear under most clothes if you don't wear anything that's too tight. My only complaint, and I have this problem with most bras, is that I don't think they can get by calling it an ""18-hour"" bra. Every bra I wear, and I've experimented with different sizes, seems to eventually ride up in the back and sag in the front. It's like I either have to wear more than one or change half way through the day. For the price though, it is good."
1,It SMELLS!,This bra reeks. It smelled bad when I opened it and the smell gets worse after each wash. According to many other reviews on other sites it's because there is rubber in the bra. I have been unable to get rid of the smell. I plan on ordering a different bra from another manufacturer and throwing these away. I am so upset but the smell won't come off these bras and I can no longer stand the horrible smell that surrounds me when I wear this bra.
1,Uncomfortable!,I hate tis bra. I read the other reviews and bought this bra based in them. But it is really uncomfortable and i am returning it.
5,EXPANDED SIZES,GREAT FOR PLUS WOMENGREAT SHOULDER STRAPSGOOD QUALITYBLACK WAS CHEAPER THAN ANY COLOR AND IT WAS WORTH IT
4,Amazon order of playtex 18 hour bra,"Came perfectly packaged. I have bought this same bra before, love the color and the style. My only problem that it is very tight across my back and hurts after awhile. Since this is my size and I have ordered same bra before , I had to check the tab to make sure it was indeed my size. it was. I am keeping it anyway, Knowing that it will stretch out some after awhile. Otherwise, I love the hold, love the comfort straps, never digs into shoulders, and I am more pleased than not since the price was reasonable for this style and name bra."
3,it has it's days,"this bra is not that comfortable and the material irritates my skin. i'm pretty active and enjoy sports, it is in no way made for that."
3,Cushion hooks better,The materials are a little stiff. Might be more comfortable after several washings. The horrible little hooks should be better cushioned. They press into large breasts harder because of the weight put on them.
5,Great bra,"Awesome bra especially for the price. I have priced this particular bra at over $30.00 a piece. Would do business with this vendor, very pleased with service"
2,Not fo rme,"Clearly not a sexy bra, but I figured it looks very comfortable. Unfortunately when it's actually on it's 1) not comfortable, and 2) very ""old school"" -- pointy! Very unattractive line under clothes. So it doesn't serve any purpose."
2,"Strange fit, but love straps and blue color!","I tried this particular bra twice, in two different sizes and although I love the color (the sailor blue) and the makeup of the straps, the cup is just too pointy and does not seem to contour correctly. This is the only bra that I have experienced this ""overage"" with. I went down a cup size and it did not make a difference ... I just could not get this bra to fit me.I've tried several washes (even drying on hot) to see if a little shrinkage would help. No go. What I am left with is a relatively comfortable bra around the back and shoulders with a cup that has too much fabric in the front and is too pointy for me. Usually not a problem. Unfortunately, this bra has been relegated to the bottom of my drawer and is only used under multiple layers where any kind of wrinkles or gathered material won't be visible. I'm glad I only paid around $10 for it.Two tries though and it still didn't work for me."
5,Good price good fit,"I ordered these online because I could not find them in my particular size in my local stores. I'm a big gal and Playtex has been one of my favorite brands for a long time. This is a good bra, snug fit, very supportive, and the straps are quite comfortable considering all the support they give. It covers everything, it does what I need it to do, and the price was pretty much perfect! Glad I ordered."
5,The only bra I will wear,"I have been wearing this model for over 20 years, so I am happy to find them here at these lower prices."
5,Great buy,"I have been looking for a good fitting bra for a long time. I finally found it. The fit is great, straps do not slip and it is comfortable to wear all day. I would recommend this bra to anyone."
5,Ky. Quality Bargain Shopper,This is the only bra I can wear that gives me the ultimate support and comfort that I need. I can not find such a great bargain price anywhere but Amazon.com.
2,PLATEX WOMENS 18 HOUR BRA/ WITH COMFORT STRAP,i WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT..THE SIZE IS WEIRD. THE MATERIAL I THOUGHT WOULD BE COMFORTABLE (ITS SCRATCHY) AND IT JUST DOESN'T FIT.
5,Comfort and Support,"I have a lot of difficulty getting bras to fit ""just right"". I do not like underwires so finding a supportive bra for my cup size (D) without one is difficult - far less to find one that you can actually wear all day. This is the best bra I've ever owned. It's supportive AND comfortable and when the straps are adjusted - they fit just right and do not have to fixed during the day - they stay put. Another very wonderful feature for me is that the lift it gives is very slimming and my clothes seem to fit much better. I am just so happy to have found this product!"
2,Weird sizing,When i got this bra i was so happy ... i have been looking for this model for years ... but then when i finally tried it on it was big ... i know my size (i constantly measure myself) and i always wear a 38C ... but the cups were so large i cannot wear the bra ... so know your size well and maybe contact the company before you buy one
5,18 Hrs indeed,I bought these for my mom who is very particular and picky about bras and she loved them!. She found them comfortable and said they offered superb support
1,I didn't know I was going on tour with Madonna,Makes the girls look like 1960s cone bras. It's so cheaply made it's not even worth the time to return it. No bueno.
2,Not to comfy,"I must say I had to take it off within the hour, I am a size G so finding a good bra is hard and I don't fell like I found a good one here. itchy and hurt my shoulders :0("
2,Not for ladies under 55,"I am pregnant and needed new bras. I thought this would be great and figured it would offer great support. It does offer support, however, it makes you look like you have cones on your chest! This is something my grandmother would wear! Not only that, the top of the bra in the front is so high that I can't wear it with normal t-shirts. Everyone would be able to see it. Talk about full coverage!!!! I am mid thirties and this bra is way too old fashioned for me."
5,great bra!,I am a size 3X and this is the only bra that offers enough support for me without an annoying underwire digging at me. These bras also hold up better than Just My Size bras.
1,Size way wrong. Huge for what it should have been.,I already have the UPS return receipt to send this back for credit. I think there were so many on sale because the sizing was so far off the mark.I wear this size all the time in other bras I buy and this was just huge. Couldn't give this one away so I'm sending it back.Uses to getting good products but NOT this time. Oh well.
4,Bra,"Love the fit of this item, but was so very disappointed that after the first wash, one of the three hooks came off. Well, who is going to take the time to fix this kind of bra hook. Very disappointed"
4,18 hour,This bra is in a beautiful blue color. It is a bit tight fitting around the back area. But supports nicely.
4,Satisied Customer,I choose this bra as I have had others like it and the straps are very comfortable. they stand up very well.I would recommend it to anyone that has trouble finding a good fitting bra.
3,bra,"This is the bra I always wear, so comfortable, I was so sorry I didn't get the color I ordered or this would be a 5 star. No problem"
3,Bra,It was ok I really don't like it but it'sok I just like to see my bra before I buy it . Every bra is not for everyone.
3,Smells funny,"I love the color but this is not going to be my favorite Playtex bra. First of all, even after soaking and washing, it has an odd rubbery aroma that other Playtex bras do not have. Second issue is that the bra straps cannot be adjusted as tight as on other Playtex bras so I cannot adjust the bra so that the cups are filled properly. There is a bit of fabric fold over at the bottom of the cup. I can put up with it but will not buy this style again."
4,tight fit,"I do like the design of the shoulder straps, I've only washed it once so far. I don't know how long they will retain their padding. Only thing was it was a tad tight around the ribs. I'm looking into breaking it in a little, see if it has some wear issues."
5,A Great Collection!,"It's great to see these shorts finally released on DVD. The prints are really clean, and the scoring is tastefully done. Harry Langdon, in my opinion is one of the greatest comedians and directors of all-time, and this set certainly does him justice. I really couldn't say enough positive things about this set.My only 'complaints' (if one could even call them that), are there's a couple more shorts I would have liked to have seen added. It may very well have been that the titles weren't available, or there were copyright issues. And the commentators seem to have gotten a bit of disinformation regarding the short ""Love, Honor, and Obey (The Law), mistakenly crediting to Educational Pictures. An honest mistake, and not one that effects the over-all greatness of this collection.A must-have for any fan of Harry Langdon or silent comedies."
2,Too cheap,"The outside rod screws in from the bottom, and it is a peice of sheet metal. It does not feel very substantial. I gave it 2 stars, because it is shiny.The screws get wobbly after some use, and you will look like an idiot for buying it. I used it on a job site rest room, and the crew thought it was tacky. I did not bring it home after the job was completed.It might look nice in a mobile home at Eatonville's River Bend Trailer Park. It is shiny."
3,more for adults than children,"the idea is clever & good songs were chosen, however, the appeal is more for adults 30-50s than for children; my 5 yr old received this from Santa Christmas 2003 & is NOT interested in more than a couple of the songs such as ""Thank Heaven for Little Girls"", ""Teddy Bear Picnic"", & ""Miss Mary Mac""; most of it just sounds to her like what older folks listen to on the radio; when it is played, she asks for ""my music"" or ""children's music""; might have different affect on preteens"
5,Try it you WILL like it,"I have used Beta57 on podiums, in studio, worship service for lead vocal and yes with instruments. It is an excellent all around mic. In fact I like it a little better than a Beta58. You can spend a lot more money and get less of a mic."
4,Very good color print,"-The laser color is vivid and sharp.-The toner cartridge lasts a long time. I still have half of the ink after one year regular usage.-It does not use drum - good to save money but the printed paper curled. Fortunately, the curling allivated after it absorbed moisture.-The network sharing feature works fine. The print sharing with PC may out of sync sometimes. Need to power cycle the printer to recover.-When print name card, the second and later batches can get tainted. Need to wait until the printer recalibrated before it can print a clean one. The regular printing is good without the ink contamination."
1,It is the worse printer ever owned.,"To be honest, this printer sucks. First of all, if you run out of colour ink, you can't print black. Besides that colour ink seems to disappear out of thin air very, very fast. Another problem I encountered was the bad alignment. Lots of time colours aren't aligned. At the start I could fix it very easily with just rebooting the printer or resetting it. But after sometimes it just doesn't come back, specially the magenta colour. Another big problem I have with this printer is the price of the toner, it's very expensive. Simply it isn't worth it, the toners are expensive and run out really fast and you will waste lots of paper with bad aligned printing."
3,Caveat Emptor,"First, in general this has been a great printer, worthy of the venerable HP name.Now, on to the caveats.First, this printer is essentially ""Windows only."" I do not have a Mac but I can tell you that there is no way in the world to get Linux to print to this machine. For the majority of people that's not an issue, but if you're browsing for a low-cost reputable color laser and you DO use Linux, be aware that this one isn't for you.Second, and worst of all: I have fried the fuser roller on mine recently because I - stupidly, perhaps, but understandably - tried to use HP photo-glossy paper in the printer. It melted the glossy layer of the paper onto the roller, and I now have a very large doorstop instead of a printer.I hope these remarks will be helpful to someone."
2,Open at the store if you don't buy from someone online,"My brother brought his brand spanking new NOT previously opened by human hands 2600N printer home from Best Buy only to find that it was missing all four toner cartridges. Thankfully Best Buy swapped it out for one that came complete from HP.This box had the original packing tape from HP still sealing the box. Luckily our Best Buy took it back, otherwise my brother would have had to fork over another $300 for toner.Make sure you open it at the store if you buy this printer from a retail outlet."
2,No VISTA Support for HP laptops,This printer will NOT be supported on 64 bit operating systems! I learned this the hard way.
3,Great printer--Until it breaks,"I really like the HP 2600n. Quality is very good. Of course, like most laser printers, the toner winds up being very expensive. I do most of my printing on a different printer and save this printer for my color needs.This is the second 2600n printer that I have purchased. The first one lasted less than 2 years, then stopped working abruptly. It didn't take long to figure out that it needed a new toner fuser. The cost of the fuser was $199 plus labor. That's the crazy part. It's cheaper to buy a new printer, getting four new laser cartridge, then repair it. So that's what I did. At least the set up was a snap, and I still have the laser cartridges from the broken one."
1,This product has been a joke,"Our office has utilized 2 of these in the 12 years we've been in business and although they print a little dark, they do pretty well. After an identical model started producing unacceptable quality, I purchased this used machine thinking I would be able to use all the unopened ink cartridges still in stock. Within a month or two of receiving this, the color has become absolutely washed out, maintenance hasn't helped, new expensive cartridges haven't helped and I'm about ready to throw this thing in the trash. Just love these beautiful experiences."
1,Cartridges WAY too expensive,"I bought this printer to use for my business printers flyers. Color is great, however, shortly after purchase I started getting a line in the prints. Turns out the cyan cartridge was bad. Took a printer repair person to figure this out at a serious cost and then they wanted to charge me a full price for a used cartridge.When I needed to replace the cartridges, it turns out they can't be refilled and the cost of a new set is about a 1/3 of the price of the printer. Should have bought something else."
5,Work Horse for Resturant,"I have had this printer for about a year and I no complaints, the print quality is excellent for the countless; menus, newsletters and posters i print for my small resturant on a daily basis. It has easily paid for it self many times over from the ink savings over my previous ink jet.I don't write reviews often but as I am waiting for it to spit out our current newsletter I just wanted to spread the news! Easy to unjam/replace catridges (only ever had to replace the black 1X in the past year).Great buy for anyone buying too many ink jet catridges; small businesses or small school or church who need a nice quailty, economical color printer."
4,Perfect for a home office,"I own my own my own business that I run out of my home office. I was in desperate need of a nice color laser printer. I got an amazing deal here on Amazon for this printer ($250 on Amazon, $400 in stores), and it also turned out to be a great product! Much faster than you would expect, very easy to print out specialty papers like envelopes, very nice quality. It uses a lot of toner, and if you replaced them all at the same time, it would cost more than the printer; however, you can get refurbished toners for 1/3 of the price, making upkeep minimally expensive. It gets smudgy more often than I'd like, but there's a nice cleaning function that helps with that issue. Overall, a really good choice for a home office."
1,These printers are junk!!!!,I had one of these because I got a good price on it and wasn't interested in speed at the time. They are definately slow but I could afford it and had always wanted a colored laser printer for minimal use....well I got minimal use. I'm not sure that the printer even lasted a year and it is now in the dumpster. They have a known problem with shadowing problems and of course that is what happened to mine. HP is a fantastic brand and I will buy another one but I'll guarantee you that it won't be this model.
3,"Nice, but sssslllllooooowwwwwww","update: After owning the printer for several months, I'm happy to report that toner usage is nowhere near as bad as I had initially feared. I've removed those comments. Make sure you find the ""black only"" option for printing grays. I would update the rating to a four, but Amazon won't let me change it.------------------------------------------------First, the good news. The HP 2600n works well. Setup over the network was simple and it produces nice looking documents.But, there's not so nice news.First of all, it's slow. Really really slow, slowest laser printer I've ever owned.Second, it has problems with handling stiff cardstock. It appears to bump the paper against some internal mechanism so that a horizontal line of text will appear smeared. Not every card, but about half of them.Overall, pretty happy. Especially since I caught it during a 50% off sale."
3,HP Color LaserJet 2600n,"i don't like this printer as much as i liked my 2500 laser printer. there are times when it doesn't print, and i have to go to the software and pause the printing and then resume it. i also don't like the tray for paper underneath. it slides out and takes up a lot of room which i don't have. i also have to make adjustments for envelopes. the 2500 had an open tray which was easier to deal with. of course, this printer was far less expensive than the 2500. basically, it's a nice printer. i have nothing negative to say about the printing itself."
3,2600N,Slow printing..goes into initializing phase at any time and takes forever to finish doing whatever it does. This is not good when you are trying to print a job in front of a customer
1,Cost of cartridges HIGHWAY ROBBERY!,"This may be a good laser printer, but the very high cost of these cartridges (a set of four costs MORE than the printer itself!!!) negates everything else about this specific printer. What a grand RIPOFF! Next, they'll be charging us '3 figures' AND your 'first-born' for a cartridge!"
2,Dissapointment,"Because of the good reviews from everyone else, I thought that this would be a great printer, but it did not live up to my expectations. Its pretty loud, leaves toner streaks, and most importantly, the print quality is not good, and we have tried different things, like special paper. Which means that you can't print good quality brochures with it.I used to think that all HP products were great, but the more experience that I have with them, the more that I realize how bad they really are, including their support. I have had much better luck with Brother products and I wish I would have spent more and gotten the Brother MFC-9840, which is an all-in-one color laser."
1,Not a Good One,"Printer made a rattling/hammering sound most times when I hit the Print button; sometimes even had to turn it off to stop the action.Color quality just OK on paper prints, but on photos was terrible, whether on glossy or matte paper. Color smeared on both front and back of photo paper, which jammed in the machine about half the time.Be careful ordering this from Amazon; they use a no-name shipper instead of UPS, Fedex, or USPS - shipper used snail-mail to contact me, and setting up delivery was inconvenient since I live 50 miles from their nearest location."
3,Bad HP support,"I bought this printer a couple of years ago when it first came out and have been happy with print quality on the few occassions that I have used it. I recently moved and a bad experience trying to get support for the new driver download. Luckily, I saved my old one, but it makes me not want to be an HP customer when they want to charge $25 for supporting a printer I've barely used and I bought it at a significantly higher price point than it's at now. My full review is at: [...]"
1,5 stars?! You got to be kidding.,"I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MACHINE!!!I just can't believe 36 people gave 5 stars. They must be associated with HP! I started having a problem with line on a copy and talk to technician which cost me $36 even my problem is not solved. Also you have to have all inks in order to print black copy.I realized this after I bought 2 color inks replaced, knowing this line not going to be removed I don't want to invest another $90.00 for one more color ink. I went to internet to search this problem I realized so many people purchased this machine having same problem. Now it's sitting in my office just collecting dust."
3,not worth expense,"This printer is extremely easy to set up. I have been disappointed in the print quality when I print in color from the very first time I used it. The ink smears onto the page when I print in color and the more color pages I print, the worse it gets. Ink cartridges are so ridiculously expensive that I cannot afford to replace a color cartridge now that it has run out. I have continually tried to print in grayscale but the printer won't print and keeps telling me I need to replace the Cyan color even though I'm not trying to print in color. Help menu is pathetic. I will try the suggestion from the previous reviewer about going to the printer controls and changing the settings. I wouldn't recommend this printer if you want good color copies."
3,color values aren't real great,"color values aren't real great, but it will pick up thick laser label paper w/o trashing it."
3,Sweet Water,This product has a nice--if very subtle scent---but seems to be more of a hand sanitizer than a bar soap or a liquid body wash. I'd hate to go out in the summer using just this product without using a deodorant soap (like Zest or Dial).
2,why so expensive?,"I'm happy to have a safe, natural alternative, but what's with the price?? $24 comes out to $4 bottle.. they're $3 for a 10oz bottle at Target, and that's not even on sale."
2,"Soap Itself is Nice, but Yet Another Shipping Problem","The soap itself is great, but I see that I'm not the only person to get a sopping wet shipping box with at least one now-empty bottle inside. It's not worth the hassle of sending it back to deal with, so I recommend just not buying it (from Amazon) in the first place."
5,Good soap at a great price.,"I used to but scented soaps from the mall store, but discovered this and have been using ever since. There is only one frangrance, but its just fine for me and my family and I enjoy the convenience of the subscribe & save feature."
4,Excellent product.....incredibly poor manufacturing/packaging.,The box of six came in with the entire contents of one bottles spilled. The pump cap was not even on one turn. The box was a soggy mess. This is the 2nd box of six Method foaming soap bottles that I have ordered. The first purchase came incredibly individually wrapped so that the caps could not come loose. This last purchase was not.I will order the Green Tea and Aloe Method foaming soap again but I will find the place from whom I ordered it the first time.
4,"Smells good, cleans good, stings like hell in your eyes, though","This bottle looks nice on my sink, and I like that the soap is both effective and environmentally friendly. It's a huge step up from your typical gloppy (and questionable health-wise) anti-bacterial soap.But woe unto the poor sap who accidentally gets some of this in his eyes. Natural does not equal tears-free. Johnson and Johnson baby shampoo this ain't. Ouch ouch ouch!"
4,method soap - 1/2 case,we were happy to find somewhere to purchase this in bulk - although during shipping one of them was broken and another had leaked so it was only 1/2 full.
3,Too drying for frequent washing...,"Because I have dogs, I have to wash my hands often. I find this soap to be too drying. Fragrance is fine and it cleans well, attractive packaging and foaming is good...but too drying."
2,The pump is terrible.,"I've heard foaming hand soap is more economical and eco-friendly, however, the Method Foaming Hand Soap bottles do not last long and therefore, the buying a refill for the pump is pointless. I have a pair of hand pumps that have not lasted past 2 refills because the pump is not sturdy. It is unclear why they break, it seems that after refilling them the second time, they no longer work and while soap comes out, it isn't foamy. I'm not certain if this then is wasting the soap or what. The soap works great and I still have a large refill container but as soon as the pump is out, I'm going to buy a different brand for the pump but continue using the soap."
4,This is the place to go for onion farming magazines,"Not even sure how to criticize such a magazine, except that it's most definitely geared towards the large onion producer. In fact, it's a testament to the strength and diversity of American farming that such a magazine exists."
5,Great Product,"Excellent product - The DVD's are done very professionally, with great supplemental material and extra comments - very enjoyable"
5,Great gift,My boyfriend loved this surprise gift. He really enjoyed watching all of the guys and the quality is decent. I didn't love it but I'm not a huge redneck joke fan.
5,THIS IS THE FUNNIEST STAND UP IVE EVER SEEN,"I have to say, when I was watching this, I was crying out with laughter. Bill, Jeff, Ron and Larry show that rednecks are funny. At Christmas, the family watched it, and it was 2 hours of pure laughter. This was the best dvd we have bought."
5,Great Comedy Show for Movie Nights,This show is amazing. You will have to watch this multiple times because you will be laughing to hard to hear. These four comics united together put on perhaps the best comedy performance in history. You might as well buy it you will want to watch it again and again. Great for almost all ages.
4,Blue collar comedy tour: The Movie,"I got this movie for a funny night with me and my hubby. He always laughts at me because he said it is true about the way hispanic people are when I rented George Lopez VHS from the (Latin Kings of Comedy Show )I being Hispanic. So I went and got the red neck tape for him, he being a Red Neck and all. (Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The movie). We just laught at eachothers jokes. It was a fun night for both of us and you can injoy it also. The JOKE I like was when the one he said "" YOU COULD BE A RED NECK IF YOU HAVE YOUR ""WORKING TV"" SETTING ON TOP OF YOUR ""NON-WORKING"" TV.LOL"
5,great comedy,I have never laughed so hard in my life at these 4 people. I especially like Bill Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy's deliveries.My whole family enjoyed it immensely!!!!!!
5,"Funny, As Always...","I have seen all the comedy tour ones these guys have done... loved them all. It is always funny, most all the family can watch these and not be so worried, and it is a good laugh on a rainy day!"
4,My sisters got a lot of moles...,"Ok, lets face it people, this is not a cinematic jewel or an experiment in artistic filmmaking. This is stand-up comedy- on tape, interspersed with 4 or so ""episoes"" of what happens when you let rednecks into the mall... or a spa...And it will make you laugh.Best when viewed with a group of similar friends or perhaps at family reunions/dating opportunities if you're from the Great South.Its the same old redneck humor that you have heard, but what else would you expect? You don't watch a Jeff Foxworthy special for Frasier-esque humor.So turn off that critical side of your brain, grab a six-pack and your trucker hat, unbutton the top button of your jeans and let your belly shake with laughter as you laugh at 4 comedians who are having just as much if not more fun than you."
5,blue collar comedy tour,"Wonderful, very funny and entertaining the whole way through. The whole family has enjoyed it and it gets shared around to friends. Recommend."
5,Blue Colar Comedy Tour,"This was a christmas gift some years ago my son has really enjoyed this...some things are just too funny for words.If you like comedy and funny jokes and to laugh then you really might enjoy this one.I maked it I LOVE IT ,,,due to my son really didOk with me I can take it or leave it..."
5,Blue Collar Hilarity!,"Blue Collar Radio on Serius and XM Radio offers this fantastically funny standup comedy style which I'd never heard of before I had XM radio. Being a classical musician by profession and a resident of a large non-southern city in the US, I wouldn't have believed I would think this kind of humor was so hilarious! These three DVD's are films of these four guys doing standup in theaters across the country and they've kept the best for us! Jeff Foxworthy is also the host of TV's ""Are You Smarter Than A Fifth Grader?"" so you may have seen him there! Or in his most famous routine, If you look for women at your family reunion, ""you might be a redneck""! Buy this! You'll die laughting!"
2,blue collar tour 3 pack,"I purchased this after catching glimpses of it at a someone's home. I purchased it to find out this one is slightly different and not as funny as I expected. Be careful before you purchase it. Two of the comedians weren't very funny and one of them is such a conceited drunkard, it is sickening to watch him. I enjoy Foxworthy but the others aren't as good as him. Good Luck."
4,Poor packing cases,A three DVD set that arrived with two of the DVD's flopping around in the cases due to the plastic cases breaking during shipment. There was no visible damage to the outer box.The videos are excellent and I watch them over and over. These guys are great together.
4,Funnier than you would think.,I really wasn't going to ever see this movie but a friend of mine brought it over and oh my gosh did I laugh almost the whole movie. I personally don't care for Ron White and Larry the Cable Guy but will admitt I did find a lot of their jokes funny.This movie was actually a funny movie. And because of that I even watched the new movie.But as other reviewers have stated the Git-R-Done is kind of played to death as is the prayer he says.But you should still check this movie out.
5,very very funny!!,"this goes to show that if you put the right people together that a comedy tour can work. i am a big fan of larry the cable guy, jeff foxworthy and bill engvall and being able to have them in a show like this one. not being that familiar with ron white i enjoyed watching his section of the show. if you are not familiar with any of the comics on this dvd then you need to purchase this dvd, this a good way to get a good laugh. if you watched any of this show on tv and did not see the whole show then you need to purchase this dvd, it is worth the money to buy this dvd."
4,Funny...,"It was funnier than some but not as funny as others. I liked the bits with Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engval and Ron White, could live with out Larry the Cable Guy, but that's just me"
3,Repeats Jokes,"The Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie is good; yet IF you have heard these comics before, you will hear the same ole' jokes. So, don't buy it IF you have bought their stand up stuff."
4,Ron White is the BEST!!,"This is a totally hilarious DVD. Excellent performances by all, although Jeff Foxworthy is getting a little stale. But it's worth it just to see Ron White's bit."
1,Lame Stereo-Types & Lamer Catch Phrases,"This collection of corny humor was hard for me to watch.It's a rehashing of old ""Hee-Haw"" material with the performers using cheesy red neck stereo types and catch phrases.I know they have their fans,but you can never under estimate the public's need for the familiar, (Git R Done,Here's Your Sign,You Might Be A Red Neck.....ad nauseum) Not for me. I prefer my comedy to be funny.This is hillbilly humor at it's lamest."
1,Horrible,I bought it after reading good reviews but the movie sucked.Out of 90 odd minutes only few jokes were good.Watch a standup comedy of Sienfeld like last man standing. Way bettter..!!
1,Huh?,"Geez, was I disappointed. I bought this on the basis of the reviews here and it turned out to be rude and crude (although I did like the fart sequence). Much of the material is sexual in nature, I was embarrased to have my 11 yr. old watch it."
1,How Stupid Can You Be??,"This is far and away the dumbest thing that I have ever seen. I didn't find the jokes funny, the comedians can't even speak real English and the whole thing is way overrated. This is racist as well. I really don't think jokes about NASCAR (which is not a sport by the way) , how crappy their famliy is, are very funny. In fact it is downright stupid. Redneck comedy needs to curl up and die. The only thing this had going for it is that it was at least better then Rodney Carrington...WORST COMEDIAN EVER! ALthough, Larry(I can't speak properly) the Cable Guy comes a close second. There are hundreds of things funnier than this. Like being shot. Anyway, if you are looking for something funnny, go somewhere else and leave this to all the dumb rednecks.I gave this one star because there wasn't an option for none."
1,I didn't get it!!,I'm a huge fan of Stand up comedy!! And this comedy show stinks. Or maybe I just don't get hill billy humor. I laughed 2 or 3 times through the entire show. What a waste of time.
3,it had some moments,"there was some moments from this comedy performance that worked. Larry the Cable Guy cracked me up the most. Jeff Foxworthy had some moments has well.Bill got going with the ""Sign"" jokes. Ron White was cool with His Opening&Vibe. I'd give this about a 3&Half it was a trip in some spots.cool seeing David Allen Grier rolling with the Cats."
5,Great movie great condition,what is there to really say. The movie is hilarious and needed to add this to my collection. If you like funny and you like Ben Stiller go ahead and buy this movie you will not be disappointed
3,product was in pretty,"pretty good condition, although advertised as ""New"" it arrived and was definitely resealed and previously viewed, despite that it plays great andis just as I remember..Hilarious"
2,Never Recieved,I never ended up attaining the product and it took a month to recieve my money back for the purchase.
5,my mans packin,"""repulse the monkey - part the wild horses mane"" ""im doggin it, lets go T"" ""i see a future chairman of a fortune 500 company, there i see a future rap artist..."" ""i like comedians, maybe i should book you on a tour sometime"" ""get off the scale!"" ""you're a negativity spreader"" ""there are alot of myths about the abdominal muscles, this is one i am glad to put to rest... you disgust me!"""
2,Slow shipping,The product itself is great. It took 2 weeks to get it. 1 week is acceptable. 2 weeks is ridiculous.
1,An Exercise in Delusion,"The only remotely good thing in this movie is Ben Stiller, whose parody of an infomercial health nut is very funny and fresh and well-done. The rest of the movie is absurd. The message seems to be that fat kids may be different and ostracized, but they should learn to accept their lot in life, and it's ultimately okay because they are better and smarter than ""normal"" people anyway. Someone who is not fat is not intelligent and is invariably a jerk. At least among men; women are never truly explored. The movie also teaches that if someone is a mean jerk it is acceptable to injure and capture them and hold them in an electrified cell for weeks. Because he is exposed as a mean jerk at the end, there are no legal repurcussions. Also absurd is the fat kids' complete obsession with food, a desire that goes beyond sexual ... man, what a goofy movie."
1,Ben Stiller is the only redeeming thing about this movie,"This is one of the worst things I've ever seen. Not only is it unintelligent and unfunny(except for some of Ben Stiller's scenes) it's unrealistic and immoral. The message of the movie seems to be that overweight people are better than everyone else. The camp full of kids who are healthy are portrayed as idiots. They lose the final challenge at the end based on the fact that the healthy kids don't know history or math. What does being overweight have to do with intelligence? Are fat kids smarter because they don't go outside much and are forced to study? The movie is perpetuating stereotypes like ""fat kids love eating"". They have a veritable orgy of excess when they take over the camp, covering themselves in chocolate syrup and honey. It's supposed to be funny but it's just stupid. Trust me, stay away from this movie. It's a cliched horrible mess."
4,Funny family comedy for any age,Better than I expected. It was pretty funny. It wouldn't have been good without Ben Stiller. I think its good for kids but Ben Stiller still makes it funny for adults. If you liked Stiller's character in Dodgeball then you'll love his character in this movie.
5,heavyweights,im so happy that heavyweights has come onto blu ray this has been one my favourite childhood movies anyone who hasn't watched should by this movie for the kids or of yourself it is a classic.
4,Fun kids film,"The basic premise is kids going to fat camp, but it's more than that. The camp is run by a crazy fitness dude (played by Ben Stiller) who tries to bully the kids into losing weight and placing somewhat unrealistic demands on them. Soon enough the kids have had enough and go into revolt, with some hilarious results. Overall a really funny film, and Ben Stiller did a great job in his role."
3,Where's the widescreen treatment?,"Disney strikes again, ruining anotherclassic with a DVD sans- widescreen format,remastered video, or special features.I'm not arguing against the fact thatHeavyweights is a masterpiece but...If you can put 5.1 on a movie that lendsitself to 2 actual surround sound moments,then consider adding the following on the10 yr Anniversary Edition:commentary by stiller and castoriginal marketing stills""Oh, Wow- GoKarts"" - an original feature documentaryPapa Perkis' Recipies for DietersLeah Lail on finding the infirmary""Cody Wants to Have Fun"" a featurette by Cody Burger""Tranformational Facilitators and Me"" promountil then Disney Classic DVD's,You stink, you stink, you stink, you stink!"
5,Ben Stiller didn't win an Oscar for this?,"Ben Stiller got snubbed at the Oscar's for his role in this movie, he is simply amazing! and this movie is a classic 90s masterpiece.. everybody should pick this up like right now! you won't be disappointed, so glad this made it to blu ray, picture and audio quality are great, special features are top notch"
5,The Funniest Movie I've ever Seen!,Heavyweights is one of my all-time favorites. It is hilarious! Makes me laugh every time I watch it. It is a great family movie.
3,Cute movie,Cute movie - good for the whole family. I just wish the DVD would have included extras like outtakes or deleted scenes.
5,Heavyweights,"I love this movie! I could not find it in any store, and Amazon.com had it! MY movie came very quickly and in great condition!"
3,Something Missing,"If you are sensitive about your children seeing TV violence you may want to skip this DVD. Being a long time Looney Tunes fan I was thrilled when I came across a new movie. Sadly something is lacking in this film. The wisecracking characters were gone and have been replaced with unimaginative diagloge and an excessive amount of slapstick violence. Of course one would expect a certain amount of slapstick, it is Looney Tunes after all but it was way over done. I suppose it's just easier for Bugs to beat Daffy about the head with a candy cane than write something witty. I guess all good things come to an end."
2,Don't Make Them Like They Used To,"The movie wasn't what I expected. It didn't have the clever humor that the old Looney Tunes shorts possessed. The voice characterizations were awful. Nobody compares to the talent of Mel Blanc. They also could have utilized some of the other characters better, instead of making them just extras in the background."
5,Not as bad as they say and GREAT music too!,"Unlike the other two reviewers, I bought this for my kids and we all loved it. It's fun to be able to share Bugs and the gang with my kids after being raised on the Looney Tunes characters. I especially liked the Big Phat Band movie score and the bonus features - watching the band record one of the songs from the soundtrack. Pretty cool."
4,I loved it!!!,"I disagree with a lot of reviewers. I thought this was a great Looney Tunes film! It was just all so cute! Daffy happens to be one my favorite characters, and he was great as the role of good ole Scrooge. ^_^"
1,Truly Awful,"Bad all around. Part and parcel to what is wrong with the Loony Tunes franchise. They still, to this day, have yet to figure out how to recapture the magic of the original theatrical shorts. This is just garbage. I wanted it to be good but it just isn't. It's just unwatchable. Every note is off key. Stick to the old specials shich were holiday themed shorts cobbled together with additional animation bookending it all and tying them together. UNtil someone takes this franchise on hand and dowes something worthwhile the original shorts are really all we have. EVery attempt at something new has been a misfire."
1,Terrible,"Even for free on amazon prime, this was terrible. Bugs bunny is there just for show, isn't really part of the story (and his voice seems off). It's a poorly done Daffy/Scrooge that feels so rushed/forced, with tons of filler material of Daffy falling down, banging his head, every other minute. Really surprised they didn't do more with this classic tale."
1,"Bah, Humbug!","I hate to be the ghost at the feast, but....this 45 minute long short is a big disappointment.A decade or three ago, Disney created ""Mickey's Christmas Carol"" with Uncle Scrooge as - well - Scrooge, Mickey as Bob Crachit, and Jiminy Cricket as the ghost of Christmas past. It was schmalzy, but then so was the original, to whose spirit it was mostly faithful.Now comes WB with their own take on ""A Christmas Carol"", and it is not only untrue to the Dickens tradition; it is a profanation of the Looney Tunes tradition! The action is unimaginative and mechanical, the representation of the characters, while accurate in detail, is mostly lifeless, and the voices (with the shining exception of June Foray recreating Grannie) are often just wrong.It is possible to recreate the genius of Termite Terrace; WB did it with ""Looney Tunes, Back in Action"", but ""Bah Humduck"" really never comes close."
5,Fun for Everyone!,"Looney Tunes fans like myself will likely love this movie. I certainly did. A great Christmas special with all the laughs, hijinks, and a good message too. Great for the whole family really. Mine came exactly as described, at a good price, and although I chose and paid for 2 day shipping (and I ordered late at night) it was at my door the very next afternoon. And I had actually ordered a couple of other items with it so it was a nice surprise to get it early. Highly recommend!!! Thanks 5 stars!!!"
1,Disappointed,"This book, while perhaps accurate, was a disappointment because the majority of the book was given over to pro-union retoric. I was hoping to learn more about the people side of the tragedy; but this author used the horror of what happened to hammer home his point of how much we need labor unions - not just in this country but all over the world. If you are a staunch pro-union supporter (which I am not), you will find good arguments for unions. Otherwise, pass on this book."
5,Harmonic Balancer was perfect....,got part for 1/3 of the dealer cost and it worked perfect for my 97 infiniti i30t. Got part immediately
5,An Excellent Source,Rare is the event where one close to the story is also a gifted writer. This is why Gary Spivack's LOOK AT THE STARS is an event deserving your attention. Spivack was part of the process of Coldplay developing from a brand new British band that nobody had ever heard of to a household name. The author had access to events and behind-the-scenes meetings that will keep you turning pages. This is a must read for anyone curious about the music business ... whether you're a Coldplay fan or not.
4,Classic example of Illustrating interesting careers,"Gloria Skurzynski wrote this book back in 1981 so much of the material is dated as to the pictures and statistics. The book follows the careers of three women: a wildlife ranger, a wildland fire specialist, and a range conservationist. From encounters with bears to teaching environmental classes to tracking down the causes of forest fires this book helps one to understand the day to day duties of those people who take care of the recreation land around us."
5,Practical and fun to read,"This book gave me so many ideas for new plants to try, as well as new information on some of my favorites. I liked her personal experiences - they helped me avoid planting some things that sounded great in the seed catalog, but weren't that great in real life. I've already had too many experiences like that myself!Very useful suggestions for working with many different light conditions also helped me fine-tune where I'd be planting new varieties.A terrific book no matter what your level of experience with cutting gardens, and an enjoyable read. I refer to it often."
1,Worst movie ever,The biggest conflict in this movie is when one of the moms takes away the kid's DS. And one of the girls is obsessed with old people. Enough said.
3,Predeciable,"Summer Eleven was a up to date, predeceble, serouis movie about 4 eleven year old girls with their own unique issue in life. Summmer Eleven's parent cast members showed great reaction. I give this movie 3 stars."
1,Very Depressing,"I rented this for my girls (6 and 4) and they were not interested at all. I watched the movie and found it ultra depressing - each of the girls has a big family issue that they are facing. While it's ""contemporary"" and real world, it's just a huge bummer of a movie. I give it a big thumbs down. I had to turn it off because it was depressing me!"
2,Boring,The trailer looked so interesting. Then I saw the movie itsself and there was nothing anymore that could be added to the trailer because the good parts I had already seen. The rest is pure bordem. Maybe the last 15 minutes deserve 3 stars. Because everything is falling together to have a satisfactory ending. But the rest is amateurish. Two of the girls - whatever the names of the actresses were - were good. Only that their script was badly writen. I hope I will see these two promising actresses again under better circumstances.
2,"Flavor ok, coating very hard","The vanilla, chocolate and almond flavor was nice, but the coating was very hard. I am going to order a different product for my wedding."
5,Elementary Statistics,I appreciated that the item was mailed in a timely manner. Book was in great condition. Would definitely buy from this person again.
1,Wrong Edition,"I ordered Elementary Statistics A Step by Step Approach, by Allan G. Bluman Fourth Edition. Well, I did not realize it until I was half way through the first on-line lecture, but I was sent the Fifth Edition. I was happy to know that I was not crazy because when my teacher was having me look at certain problems on certain pages and they were not there, I was a little confused and concerned. I had to go to a variety of used bookstores to find the Fourth Edition, so I would have it. I did check Amazon first, but it was not available, only the Fifth Edition(now that I know the pictures on the books). Conclusion, not a very pleasing experience!"
1,You sent the wrong book. I'm waiting for you to refund this!,I ordered Statistics Fifth Edition and you asked if I would like the solutions manual to accompany the book I ordered. I said yes. You then sent me the Sixth edition. The two books don't match up and the sixth edition was useless to me. I have tried to contact you but the only reply I get is that I ordered that edition. Apparently you don't HONOR your word of complete satisfaction guaranteed. It also took longer than stated to arrive which put me behind in my class. WHERE IS MY REFUND?
4,easy step to understand statistics,easy steps approaching to statistics and good examples to practice the text.
5,comfortable,once it was broke in is is very comfortable. took a while for the break in and the extra clip pocket will not take anything other than the stock clip.
1,Didn't work for application,While this installed it would not work as a serial connection for a security system connection. I purchased another from Radio Shack and it work perfectly.
2,Buy Another Book,"As usual... the pics are great. However, the pics alone are not going to get you through the game. Up until Alexandria... I have no major problem with the book. However it is here in Alexandria that we first learn there is a magoer problem. Where is the revolver? Did we miss something?? No. They neglected to tell us where it is and how to get it. the next level is the first level in which the revolver is important. However, it does not become so important to have until after you reach the lost library. Those of you who have played the game know what I mean. So now without the revolver, I came looking for another book. I hope to find one that tells me where to find the revolver. This Guide is pretty much useless now."
4,"Bought the wrong product, but...","I accidentally bought the wrong size training slip leash for my 5 lb. yorkiepoo. However, I kept it for my parents Springer Spaniel, and it's perfect for larger breeds. My mistake became their benefit because that spaniel will drag anyone on a regular leash, and this slip lead helps train her how to walk properly without pulling."
2,Not for small dogs,"This is a quality leash but gave it a low rating to indicate it is not for small dogs. Have a 5 pound Pomeranian and the problem is that the leash is rather stiff so when the small dog pulls a bit, the leash tightens but will not release when you take the tension off so dog is choking. It is great for larger dogs. Also have a 20 pound cockapoo and it is super for her. Be very careful if you try to use it on very small dogs. For larger dogs would rate it five stars."
3,slip dog lead,My dog still seems to pull with this slip lead to the point where she is choking herself out. It is probably better than a normal lead connected to her collar in terms of controller her but it doesn't stop her from pulling if she really wants to go somewhere. Perhaps my dog is more inclined to pull than others. I found the harness that attaches in the front to be more affective.
5,Totally Worth It,"This lead is smooth on your hands and tough enough to get the job done. Easy to get on and off, and because it's a slip lead and is positioned higher on the neck, rids us of the problem of pulling without the need of a harness. It's great for training and corrections, without having to go to the extreme of a choke chain. When this one wears out in a few years, I'll definitely buy another."
2,Um... Strange...,"ok, the plot is ok- not very believable, but I can deal with it. Then the whole double chapters- you decide deal- it reminds me of the books you read when you are like 10 and you can pick your own ending... I finished it and it is ok I guess, but I would just check it out at thel ibrary if you are bent on reading it."
4,"Great action, good one liners","There's some terrific scenes in this film. The man behind ""Highlander"" directed it, and the visuals are great. Thomas Jane is good as the lead, a hard boiled legendary gunfighter. A lot of the action is slick and brutal, and quite a lot of the film is funny.The violence flows thick and fast, and there's a lot to like here.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
4,Boguart was better,"It was like watching a train wreck, or a B western, Hoping it would get better, but ... What can you say, I like train wrecks. Thomas Jane has been in better movies than this"
1,Ouch ....... 10 minutes and EJECT !!,How can DIRTY HARRY and SIN CITY be so good ..... and MALONE so bad ?Ouch this was bad !Ten minutes and we had to hit the EJECT button.The other reviewers pretty much summarize the problems with this film.
3,GUMSHOE COMEDY,"Malone is a classic scotch guzzling gumshoe. He narrates during the movie in the tough guy Sam Spade style. Early in the movie he is shot and goes to a retirement home to meet his mom, a Betty White knock-off, who nonchalantly removes the bullet from his chest. He meets a dame, who is every bit as tough talking as he is. One of the guys who is trying to kill him is a pyromaniac named Matchstick, who learned to act from watching Heath Ledger as the Joker. If fact he imitated the Joker so much, it was a bit annoying. Ving Rhames is a bad guy attempting to deal with emotional issues. The plot is confused and immaterial to the movie. There is also a stereo-typical oriental female killer, who is tough. How tough? Ving asks, ""Do you know where she keeps her knives?"" The comedy is light but good. Simulated oral sex, very brief nudity, and drops the MF bomb."
3,Give 'Em Hell Malone,"This strikes me as more of a cult hit than something that will be widely accepted. A semi-modern noire/graphic novel-esque movie, it definitely is in a category of its own. Is it in the past, present, alternate present, or alternate future? Who knows, but it was still pretty entertaining. I'd suggest renting it from Blockbuster or Netflix before you purchase. I don't regret my decision, but tastes differ from person to person. I enjoyed this movie, but know exactly what you're getting before you get it. You'll either love it or hate it, there's very little room for middle ground."
1,C'mon,"Jeff, you have the potential. Just, stop whining and get over stuff. So what if your not an adult but not a kid! This is when you earn the respect and responsibility you use for the rest of your life! If anything, you should use your childhood doing joyful things, instead of just asking your dad to publish a book, I mean that's just dirty.If you want to become serious, start from the bottom and work your way to the top. Also, apply yourself more. Your too repetitive and you wander off topic too much. If writing is your future career, try to apply yourself more."
1,My eyes!,"This book was horrible, i haven't felt so bad since i swallowed that thumb tac. artistically i wish he had been never been born. ASK PERMISSION before you use people in your books genius. take your life before someone else is ""inspired"" to write just like you..."
3,a real book,"frankly speaking,the poems are not that perfectly written,cause Geoferry is only 15, but what makes me enjoy this book so much is that is a ""real"" book. everything is so close to me, and i know the writer is writng for himself. i do appreciate the writer for he is brave enough to let so many people know his deep heart. he is a hero. keep on!"
4,"Excellent Mind, Deep Poet","Pretty good for a kid of fifteen, bright prospect for writing poetry as an adult. I hope he keeps writing. He has real talent."
1,Underdeveloped,"The poems contained in this book are underdelveloped. The title says it all, it was written by a fifteen year old and the poems seem to be rather straightforward and include little if any imagry. If you are looking for a book to relate to being that age i would subscribe to the many great literary magazines that are availible. This book just does not provide enough meaning to warrant a purchase."
1,This was NOT a book.,"When I think about my experience opening the package from my grandmother on Christmas day and finding this book, I recall the hours I spent rolling on the floor of my room laughing at Geoffery's ""problems"". Nice, kid, really. I live in a one-bedroom apartment in a bad part of town and I've never had the urge to write about my ""problems"". This ""book"" was not worth the time I spent on it. The poetry was overdone, the picture on the front looked manipulated, and I think that perhaps the prose could have some help from a real teacher: ""self-taught"" isn't any kind of teaching if you're the exemplar. Keep cracking kiddo. Better luck on the THIRD book, right?"
2,Genuinely Unimpressed,"Although it is understandable that the work of a fifteen year old would not be up to par with that of more experienced writers, the efforts of Geoffrey Dilenschneider show little hope for his literary future. His writing lacks depth, but the reader will appreciate the attempt at insight into a teenager's life."
2,A Boy Aware,"Pretentious, unoriginal, and sort of a unintentional and unflattering flattery of other famous poets. I found his use of imagery as well overdone, like sweet aunt catherines christmas eve ham on christmas morning. Stale, cold, and wrapped in tin foil, overly reflective ;). I appreciate Geoff's bravery in exposing his naked soul to millions (billions!) of people, and I see definiite POTENTIAL in Geoff's writing if he just applies himself to his love of writing for the remainder of his school life. You're only 15 Geoff, you have plenty of time to learn!"
1,The Worst Book That I Have Ever Read!!!,"I initially read this book because my co-worker recommended it to me. After reading the whole book I had a feeling of disgust. This was one of the worst books that I've ever read in my life, and should not be sold in stores. I feel sorry for anyone that pays their hard earned money to buy this book. After reading this I actually felt as if I lost some of my intelligence. He is by far, one of the worst authors that has ever lived, and deserves to be run over by a truck."
1,mine broke too,"My also failed in less than a year - It now constantly beeps and indicates 'err' on the display.I didn't have my original receipt (I didn't buy it from Amazon), but I decided to call first alert warranty services anyway (1-800-323-9005). The very friendly CSR told me that the 'err' display indicates the sensor has failed and the unit will need to be replaced. She gathered my shipping info and some info about the unit and offered to send a replacement for $6.50 to cover S&H;, and I would need to mail a check or money order since their credit-card system was down.I'm going to send in the check. I'm hoping they've addressed the quality issues, and the new unit will last longer."
1,Do Not Buy,"This CO detector seemed fine until we got an Air Hog remote controlled helicopter which set the detector off. Next we got a Vizio HD TV and just turning the TV on caused the detector to activate it's alarm. This thing was a waste of money. If you're in the market for a carbon monoxide detector, look elsewhere."
1,Don't buy this one,I have the exact same experience as the previous reviewer. The unit quit working after a year or so. It had Err in the LCD. I called warranty service and the Indian tech support guy was quite friendly and agreed to replace it at $6.5 for shipping and processing. They only take check or money order only because their credit card system is down. It seems that the credit card system has been down forever and they never bother to fix it.The quality of this product is questionable since there are so many failures. Try to avoid it at all costs.
1,Frequent False Alarms!!!!!,"I purchased this First Alert Carbon Monoxide Alarm as well as a NON-digital First Alert carbon monoxide alarm. I bought them on the same day.This alarm has gone off SEVERAL times, and it says to EVACUATE as well as states that the CO level is ""400 PPM"". I was sure my gas-line on my dryer was the culprit, so I stopped using the dryer for a week. I also put the non-digital alarm next to this one. STILL, the digital alarm will go off and yet the other one is silent (does not alarm). I also looked up and discovered others have experienced false alarms. This alarm was purchased in January, 2009, so it is new.Stay away from this product!"
5,Most Versatile Sunglasses Ever!,I love these. I can use them for just about anything and any season. They work great for snow sports and I love how they dont fog up. I also like how they work great for low light and are easy on my eyes. It does not hurt my eyes to look through them either so I can wear them for hours with no problems. They look great and are very attractive as well. They are great quality and totally suggest them.
2,Lenses fogged up,"We were skiing on a warmer day, and my body heat fogged the lenses up in a matter of seconds."
3,Not Bad....,"I bought Big Umbrella when I heard that this Band was a few very Old Friends...Russell and Derek Osieki and their awesome Drummer Eddie Cleland. These guys have been around under various names since the late seventies...you gotta support Friends! So of course I bought the CD's on Amazon. : ) Russell Osieki is a great song writer and now lives in Southern California, Derek is still located in Las Vegas and Eddie Cleland is still bangin it up in the L.A. Club Scene. You can find Derek on Facebook and Eddie on Facebook and MySpace these days."
1,for shame,"I actually rate this movie as a minus 1000. I think the writers & producers & actors & anybody else involved with this movie should make a comedy about their wives/husbands & kids being ""graphically"" blown up by some homicide bombers. I think that is actually more appropriate fodder (and funnier) than poking fun at G-D's word."
5,Hilarous film with an amazing cast!,"I can't remember the last time I laughed this hard... Actually I can- when I saw The Ten last year at Sundance. I'm a big fan of Wet Hot American Summer and Stella and I was not disappointed with David Wain's newest film. More and more amazing actors keep popping up through the film, and though the stories are often ridiculous, the actors commit so fully that it's tough not to crack up every few seconds. Winona Ryder making out with a dummy, Adam Brody stuck in the ground, Liev Schreiber placing another order for a CAT Scan machine- how can you not love it?Also, great features on the DVD! From almost an hour of deleted scenes to a commentary track with David Wain's parents. Highly recommended!"
5,incredibly awesome,"i had high expectations for this movie when i first heard about it- from the cast and the legend/amazement that is wet hot american summer. and, by golly, it surely met those expectations. its so funny! and clever and sweet, in a weird almost uncomfortable way. but david wain is a genius and my fave guy in the universe. each vignette can stand on its own but then is enhanced with repeating characters and plots in other vignettes. sometimes i forgot what commandment i was up to, but that didnt even matter. there is so much going on that its entertaining and hilarious without being confusing and stupid. for serious."
1,Struggle to Watch,"I don't know how this movie got so many five stars. Like another reviewer said, it does not even deserve one star, but you are forced to give it that much. I've seen a lot, but this is one of the most boring."
3,Has its moments,"Nowhere near as funny as Wet Hot American Summer, Stella, or The State, or for that manner the Wainy days shorts by David Wain, this movie still has its moments making it worthwhile, that is, if you like these guys. I can see how this movie could turn many people off, annoy them or bore them. For me, it was all worth it for one two-second moment of film. In Ken Marino's surgeon scene he walks into the room where the patient is in pain because he has left a pair of scissors inside of her stomach from a prior operation (as a ""goof""). He says ""it sounds like a cougar's in here!"" And then the husand is telling him how much pain his wife is in and Ken Marino makes the most absurd/hilarious/insincere/insane expression on his face, not really listening to the husband at all; it was priceless. I've rewound it sixteen hundred times and it still kills me every time. --I don't expect anyone else to have this reaction. However, you should check this movie out."
4,Flashes of brilliance...not for the humorless or the squeamish,"In a mass-media, mass-consumption, perpetual self-improvement society, a whole bunch of ""Thou shalt nots..."" are rather passe' (to say the least.) This movie had about 25-30 laugh-out-loud moments in a 75% full theater. Each of the 10 sketches has elements of bad taste (of course) along the lines of South Park / Family Guy / Reno 9-11 / Daily Show, but in the end a laugh is a laugh is a laugh. The cast includes some big-time heavy-hitters: the shocking Justin Theroux as Our Lord (who will 'get around to' the Apocalypse... eventually) and the hillarious Rob Cordry as a prisoner who seeks true 'love'. ...Only for the well-read, open minded, movie-goer who is repelled by political correctness. Gretchen Mol, Winona Ryder and Jessica Alba never looked better."
1,Worst movie ever,Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Not funny at all. Just to cringe at. Thank God it is over.
3,jessica alba can act .,i bought this because I LOVE JESSICA ALBA in a str8 male kind of wayi've been a fan since idle hands and she can act to be honest i fastforwarded through most of the parts she was'nt in thats why i only gaveit three stars because shes not in it very much
1,Too bad to rate.,Too bad to even consider.Has nothing to do with anything.A hodge-podge of not even near misses.Read a book instead.
2,Not very funny,"As a major Paul Rudd fan, I was pretty disappointed. This movie was not very funny, but I think I did laugh out loud once. It's an OK movie to watch to pass the time."
3,They edited the life out of it...,"I thought the humor was original, quirky and surprisingly dark.Trouble is, most the real laughs and essential character development was found in the ""Special Features"" section.Oh well, another film chopped up to accommodate the short attention span?I don't know."
1,Not very funny,I was so amped to see this movie. I bought it new on Amazon. I thought it was gonna be one of the movies that gets under the limelight but is absolutely hilarious. It wasn't. Nothing about it did it for me. I really disappointed. I felt like it had such potential. I love all the actors but this movie really didn't do it for me.
5,Franzus/Conair Travel Smart Travel Steamer,This is a great little steamer--the smallest possible for travel. It does take a while to warm up but worth the wait.
4,Very Compact and Similar to Previous One,"We have not had the opportunity to use this on a trip yet. We had one very similar to it before which ended getting a crack in the body after several years. We do like it because of its compactness and that it comes in a little bag to hold it in. I don't expect it to last for a lifetime, but the previous one serviced us well in all our travels."
1,Not Powerful at all,"Granted this is a travel steamer but I honestly do not have the time to wait for this to actually produce and then when it finally does, steam my clothes with the weak steam that it does produce. Better travel steamers out there."
1,USELESS,"Don't understand previous review. It was quick to heat up but only produced a very small amount of steam. You had to HOLD IT IN ONE SPOT for it to actually do anything, which was very little. Would still be here till the next ice age getting out wrinkles. TOTALLY USELESS."
2,"really tiny, but not a lot of power.","I tried this product rot the first time on a silk dress. This is a relatively easy product to steam with a powerful, standard size steamer. It took forever to get out one prominent crease that the dress acquired in transit from the store to my house. The word ""pro"" should not be in the product description at all.On the plus size, it is very tiny, and will fit easily in a carry-on bag. It takes up the space of like two pairs of socks."
3,Fair,I actually thought I was buying the original model. Even the picture in the ad showed the original model. But I got the newest and I find the old model was better and easier to travel with.
2,Takes too long to use,The unit does eventually steam but it didn't take out the wrinkles until I had a full reservoir and spent a long long time removing wrinkles. After the garmnent cooled I could still see some of the wrinkles. I believe it will work but only after spending a lengthy time working on them.
3,"Spits water, but price is right",We have owned original Franzus travel steamers for years. Our first one wore out so we bought a second one. After that one stopped working we looked for another to replace it but found out that original model was no longer made. Instead we were directed toward a new model that was offered. The new model (TS183MS) works OK but spits water at times causing your clothing item to get a little wet. Hopefully Franzus will realize that they need to fix the problem or go back to the original design.
2,Average-Performing Travel Steamer,"I've used this steamer about 20 times now. It removes wrinkles but only after firmly tugging on the garment while steaming and repeatedly running the steamer over the same area. Also it drips water on garments and offers continous steam for about 5-7 minutes due to its compact size. Although, it still beats ironing for small jobs."
2,Not a great steamer,"This steamer leaks hot water on your hands while steaming garments...it has a warning to keep it horizontal but that's almost impossible to do. Not great steam output, but better than nothing, though not much."
5,good travel steamer,"I had a steamer I loved for years that is no longer made so I purchased this one. The best part of the steamer is that it is compact and easy to pack. While it works well, the steam is continuous once it heats vs. the other steamer which had a button to push to release the steam. Aside from that missing feature, I'd recommend it."
3,cute ring,"I bought this as a ring for my four year old. He loves it and wears it always. I know it's a toe ring, but it works and the price is great. It's durable, cute and that's about it."
2,Not to the point,"The style of the book is very unscientific. The author uses a lot of words which seem to confuse rather than elucidate. After reading 20 pages, I put the book down. For a thorough, scientific and clear introduction to Jung's life and work, together with a helpful bibliography, refer to Anthony Steven's excellent book ""On Jung"". No need to waste your money on Singer's book."
5,Jazz ballads in the JATP style,"Gus Statiras and Norman Granz are gone now, but this Statiras album on his Progressive label carries on the Jazz at the Philharmonic recording tradition Granz presented for Verve. This disc presents seven-tune ballad melodies for tenor sax and trombone fans, plus one extended ensemble tune for each instrument. Recorded in 1977 as two LPs, the tunes were consolidated by New Orleans jazz producer George Buck into one 73-minute CD when he bought the Progressive label. New York-area jazz greats Scott Hamilton, Flip Phillips, Bennie Wallace, George Mraz, Derek Smith, Sir Roland Hanna, Bucky Pizzarelli and Jimmy Knepper play some outstanding JATP-style music on the ballad medlies and the extended tunes. You'll enjoy this one, and I also recommend other Progressive CDs Buck now offers, featuring Hamilton, Smith, Dave McKenna, John Bunch and other fine players."
2,You get what you pay for.....,"I've learned you get what you pay for. For the price, I suppose you're getting a decent system.The bass in this system is pretty much non-existent weather listening to the radio, watching tv or a dvd.The customer service leaves some things to be desired like a solution to problems. I called three times for the same problem. I got three different solutions non of which worked. Their common response is to reboot the system and leave it unplugged for at least 5 minutes. If you ask any detailed questions they do not have an (educated) answer.I returned this system and replaced it with a little higher end model. I'm much more happy with the new one."
1,Koss Means CRAP!,"I recently bought this item. It was easy to set up and worked great at first, but that didn't last long. Soon, I began experiencing little problems like when I would open the disc tray it would open then close as soon as it opened. Nothing too bad. The sound was great. However, less than a month after I got it, I was watching a DVD. A strange smell started coming from the player like something was burning. Suddenly it froze up. I couldn't get it to do anything. I couldn't even get the disc tray to open. I tried turning it on and off and unplugging it, but nothing worked. I finally had to remove the cover just to force it open to get my DVD back. Botton line: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,Quite disappointed,"The pamphlet itself was disappointing, only redeeming factor was the the included pinholes. Really feel that this is overpriced for the information received."
2,No lubrication whatsoever!,"The scent is mild and agreeable, which is very rare for a pre-electric lotion. Many others use tea tree oil and worse. Why??The problem with this lotion is that it does *not* lubricate in any way at all. In fact, I get the impression that after using this lotion, the razor sticks more than without using anything!"
2,Napolean Dynamite: The Complete Quote Book,"I was disappointed that one of the books I received was torn. The description said it was ""like new""."
5,Oddball Paradise,"This book in its entirety is certainly a page-turner, but am I the only one who is fascinated by the oddball stories like the America Online celebrity stalker and the sad culture of cookware cowboys? Tinseltown is more twisted than I'd ever imagined!"
3,Hollywood Indigestion,"While most of the stories have already been told...the book was still a fun read. True, we already know that the snarling Sean Penn is an idiot, and Susan Sarandon and her boyfriend Tim are ""Big Jokes Walking"".....it was still interesting to read about these freaks. What is even scarier then the Hollywood wackos, are the people that believe they really are that important."
5,Cult of Celebrity,"This book is a well-written, often-times hilarious expose of the ridiculous status given to celebrities. They are definitely the most dysfunctional group of narcissists in the world. From the insane ""religion"" of Scientology, the wacked out private schools their children attend, to the Pan Men of Hollywood, each chapter keeps the reader intrigued. My favorite chapter is AOL girl; somebody big in Hollywood should be shaking in his ""shoes""! This book reallymakes me glad I am just an average, normal, middle class American.What amazes me is how the media unjustifyingly glorifies actors! Kudos to the authors for their bravery in writing this!"
4,WRITE ON!,"Smart, funny, insightful look at Hollywood and who it warps celebs AND America. Loved some of the turns of phrases ""you can lead a whore to culture but she's still gonna stink"" (about a certain singer/actress in touble with the law right now)and the juicy AOL scandal about an AOL worker who cyberstalked celebs pretending she didn't know who they were and became their online buddies. Pathetic and hysterically funny. There's stuff in ther that's fresh and never been reported, and the writers make a strong case for Hollywood's ignoring the criminals in their midst because they're ""artists."" I think next tiem I get a jaywalking tcket I'll try that angle here in KC and see how far I get!"
1,Tired not Wired,"I was expecting something humorous, given that one of the authors worked for SPY. Instead, I discovered a disorganized hodge podge of mean-spirited rants and stale gossip, and found I couldn't get through the whole thing. Sure, Hollywood is an easy target and ripe for criticism, and so I suppose the authors should be commended for taking it on (there were a couple of unintentional moments of humor when I contemplated the authors ever getting a job in Hollywood ever after this, or how much of their royalties will go for lawsuits), but something with a sense of satire and irony and not so sanctimonious would have been more of a pleasurable read. At least all those vapid, messed up celebrities in Tinseltown retain their entertainment value. This book does not."
2,Oddball rant about Hollywood's destruction of America's morals,"I bought this because I'm interested in reading about behind-the-scenes Hollywood. I didn't really find out much about that - the writers rant about River Phoenix and Melrose Place as if they weren't 20 years too late. And ""rant"" is the correct word - I wasn't aware I was buying a torrent of personal political opinions on the state of America's morals (apparently they are in a dreadful state because of hippies, sorry dangerous freaks, like River Phoenix's family) but I found that out by about chapter 2 or 3. For any Australians reading this review, this is like something you would only hear on AM Talkback Radio stations such as 2GB. More bizarre than any of the Hollywood information, is the window into the perplexing thought processes of conservative Americans. Very odd."
1,Read this book? Shoot yourself in the foot? A real toss-up!,"I enjoy books about Hollywood and its celebrities--the good the bad and the ugly--but this book was simply repulsive. As for naming names, there were some, but there were still enough blind items to be frustrating. Plus, the tone was so completely unredeemingly negative that there were entire sections of the book I simply skipped because they were repetitive and demeaning. There aren't many books that can make me feel ""slimed,"" but this one managed to. It's one thing to dish the dirt, like gossip columnists do--they often do it with a sense of humor at least--but these authors simply poured on the manure unrelentingly, and made me totally regret having bought the book and rewarding them for it. If you're a person who genuinely loves the entertainment biz, even with its excesses, do yourself a favor and pass this one up. Compared to this book, even the tabloids read like ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm."""
4,SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST!,"To be honest the entire book was boring. Nothing shocked me until I reached the end of the book. ""E-GIRL"" Heather Robinson a teenage girl from the midwest who utilized her ""skills"" as a customer service representative to make her way into Hollywood. With some mistakes made along the way (the guy who tried to rape her) didn't stop her from using her brains and herbody. Smart and unique to have used a creative way to develope business and professional relationships. It gives me hope to think a mother of three living in Texas that I too might sign on to AOL and find someone somewhere wanting to talk to me, maybe even making my story a movie. When I thought I wasted my money, this one chapter boosted my confidence. Thank you for that."
1,Like Slogging Through Mud,"I looked forward to dishing the dirt on Hollywood, but this book was like walking through knee deep mud and about as much fun. The writers are joyless and lack wit, and the gossip is old."
1,Old Cranky Material,"The writers clipped and pasted old tabloid articles and threw in some gratuitous nasty comments of their own. It is as if the authors couldn't trust the readers to draw their own conclusions. The result is old - very old - Hollywood gossip along with a cranky lecture. This book could have been one long laugh - OK a very old laugh - at Hollywood, but the writers spoiled it."
3,Hollyweird Interrupted,When I started reading this book. I thought it was a bunch of bitter journalists trying to make a fast buck. Instead I read a very insightful look into the lives of celebrity and the hypocritical lives that they led. A while the gossip was very old news. Some of its was very shocking and unbelievable. I didn't get the constant reference of heterosexual Tom Cruise what was that about. But nevertheless I enjoyed reading this book.
1,"Weak, anti-intellectual pop drivel","Boy, there are so many more ways to waste your time than to read this drivel. Imagine the Star tabloid, except exceptionally mean-spirited, close-minded, reactionary, and humorless, and you have accurately pictured this ""book."" Instead of reading this horse-hockey, try picking up something that might actually challenge you intellectually. Your spirit and mood will be uplifted, something that is not possible if you read this collection of gossip and rumor, poorly researched and poorly written."
1,book was presented as new but printing was backwards,The book was great but the print was upside down and you had to read the pages from right to left. So annoying!! I paid full price for this book too!
3,It gets repetitive,"If you're a right wing crazy who wants to read to support your position on Hollywood and it's seemingly endless collection of airheads with outrageously uninformed opinions, then this is the book for you. All in, it's really what you get when you have uneducated, uninformed, immature people, who have won the movie acting lottery, and who in turn are at the whim of those who Ron Radosh describes in his forthcoming book ""Red Star Over Hollywood."" Add in all the aberant behavior of people too many of whom have an inordinate need to sabotoge themselves, and that's the book. It could be written in a paragraph except that a lot fewer people would read it. The need to engage in Schadenfreud is too great so this book has sold well to a large audience. And, it is titillating, fun also.If you like to watch ""E-at night"" you'll love it."
3,Heard it all before,"Definitely a well-written book about many of Hollywood's two-faced hypocrites, but if you have any knowledge current Hollywood scandals you've probably heard most of these stories before, plus the book has a not-so-subtle Right Wing-brand ""family values"" patina to it, thus making the authors' agenda a little suspect. If you read the book as an Op-Ed piece rather than unbiased reporting (even though the stories told are all pretty much true) it'll probably make an easier read.P.S. Upon reviewing many of the other reviews left for this book, I see more than quite a few other people were also put off by its Right Wing bias and lazy, re-hashed research."
5,They'll never eat lunch in that town again,"I LOVED this book. The authors paint a clever and amusing picture of how so many celebrity Talking Heads in Hollywood need to STOP THEIR INSANITY!!! How dare these hypocritical, reactionary, insecure, narcissistic, drug & sex addicted, overpaid celebrities assume that they can dictate social consciousness to the rest of us? To paraphrase from the book, as Patricia Heaton suggests when she defies the pack of lemmings on a sociopolitical issue - ""it won't be Barbara Streisand"" she has to answer to when she reaches the pearly gates. I have recommended this book to my friends who enjoy celebrity dish as well as amusing anecdotes and social commentary."
1,mean spirited,Thankfully I got this book from the library. I returned it after about 100 pages. The authors have nothing nice to say about anyone and it becomes tiresome.
1,Humorless Mediocre Writing,"I was hoping to be entertained by this book of Hollywood gossip, but I wasn't. It reads like a collection of old tabloid articles with nasty side comments."
1,Dull Dregs,"This book is dull. You will recognize most of the material in this book, except you'll remember that it was better written when you read it months ago.The incredible part is that two guys worked on this book and added exactly nothing new. They aren't wired into the Hollywood crowd to get any new gossip, or to even get details to enhance the stale gossip they printed here.While they are trying to make Hollywood look bad, the authors also make themselves look bad. It's obvious they don't know anyone, and their bitterness shows in the mean-spirited way they write about financially successful people. They didn't even try to tell their nasty gossip in an amusing way.If you want some Hollywood gossip, buy a new magazine. You'll get fresh news without the monotonous attitude."
2,A Pointless Tirade,"Hollywood Interrupted could have been an effective rebuttal to the hypocrisy which typifies much of the ""entertainment"" that comes out of the film and television industry. Instead, this book is a rambling diatribe that is as pointless and vapid as its subjects. In the place of new information and critical analysis, Breitbart and Ebner rehash old gossip and liberally editorialize. Additionally, the authors employ a writing style that depicts themselves as ""hip"" insiders destroying the beast from within. Unfortunately, the style comes off as more than a little duplicitous, especially since Breitbart and Ebner make their living reporting on the very people they are trying to tear down. Because of these weaknesses, readers who are looking for an intelligent analysis of the entertainment industry's shortcomings will need to look somewhere other than Hollywood Interrupted to satisfy their search."
1,Badly Written and Obnoxious,"Breitbart and Ebner need to take a few writing courses. Knowing the book is badly written only makes reading their biases worse. Apparently people from Appalacia are all backward moonshine makers, according to Breitbart and Ebner.They say they don't want us to challenge nonesense when it comes out of the mouths of Hollywood ""stars"". Fair enough. Equally, you should challenge the nonesense that came out of the pen of these ""authors"".This book will leave you feeling that the authors are not just denigrating Hollywood, but they are denigrating Americans by suggesting that we are too dim witted to see through them."
5,Yes we've heard it all before but this is funny!!!,"The two cyber critics repeat many of the scandals they have reported on the in the past regarding the celebrity IMportants they regularly feature in their columns and on Drudge but their biting sarcasm always hits my funnybone. Their interview with South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone is hilarious.Someone should take their idea for ""Courtney Love:the Musical"" and put it on Broadway.Some will be offended by the profanity in the book but most of it is quoting a Celebrity or someone having the misfortune to be graced by their presence.Overall the main theme of the book is Hollywood is bad because the main thought out there is ""we're Celebrities. We're rich and famous not because we have better agents and publicists than 3000 other people with more talent singing at Holiday Inns and performing at Little Theatres across America but because we're really smarter than all you unwashed masses in flyover country""."
5,A few thoughts from the plains,"Hollywood Interrupted was fun to read. Of course, it's a real eye-opener if you're living away from all those creeps in tinseltown and rarely get any inside information.The timing of this book is perfect, noting that the Oscar's are just a few weeks away. With each presenter and/or nominee, we can now refer to Breitbart/Ebner and laugh our asses off."
2,At Least These Guys Make Their Position Clear From The Start,"While well-documented, the politics of the authors are so blantantly negative and condemning it lessens the impact of their well-researched stories.Moreover, their final chapter on the heroics of online muckrakers, like themselves, is too much.While I am a big believer in checks and balances on our celebrity-obsessed, US Magazine-rich culture, I don't think these guys had to be so nasty and self-righteous to make their point.The Courtney Love and Scientology chapters were great. The online heros and, gasp, left wing politics chapters hurt their credibility."
2,"Great Expectations?! More like a ""Great Flop!""","I am currently a 15 year old in high school, taking honors english, and was just made to read the book Great Expectations. After reading ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", you can imagine my sadness by being forced to pick up this boring sleep enhancer. Throughout the entire book, there are about 5 points of climax, each lasting for a few pages. For a book of over 500 pages, you can see why my eyes started drooping after Chapter One. As a matter of fact, the book doesn't even pick up until page 350, and that is only a small gain. Reader beware, save yourself and go find something better to do with your time! There is still hope!"
2,MVP says,"The book was a waste of my time. Why, because I'm a guy who likes action and girls. This book was made for teachers and Soap Opra school girls."
1,This is only a VERY SHORT EXCERPT!!!!,This is misleading...not even 5% of the Ruskin masterwork is printed in this book.
1,make that zero star,"a total dud. not even close, so abridged it should be called ""the st of v"" or maybe ""just a few pebbles of venice."" bought this as i was needing to reference two passages re: giovanni bellini. you guessed it, neither are in this versionShame on amzn for selling such utter crap with no warning. Total ripoff!"
5,the most inincredible account of coca that i have ever read,"this book should never have been taken from us......the gov't took this book out of print!!back in the 70's...and we think we live in a democracy...freedom to read a book or the right to speak our mind as well as the right to cultivate ANY seed has been taken from us.......the Coca plant is also a ""seed bearing plant""..and the Bible says that God gave us those plants and that we should nurture them and sow them .....there was no distinction as to what seeds were good and what were bad!...It is man that abuses the substances..and harms others..."
3,Inaccuracy,"Have older version of Hoyle Word Games 3. In wordox have found that many of the acceptable computer player words are not in Webster's dictionary. Many of the words I use are not accepted, but are in Webster's dictionary. This makes it frustrating and not as enjoyable as it could be."
5,Their first and maybe their best,"Big Umbrella are one of the most overlooked bands in music. Each and everyone of their albums is a compositional triumph. Lead singer/guitarist Russell Osiecki once said that he no longer wrote love songs because ""the Beatles already wrote the best."" Still he comes up with a few gems like ""You Know Better,"" ""Big Umbrella,"" ""Way of Storms,"" and the stellar ""Joy."" Anyone searching for intelligent and emotionally thought provoking pop should check out Big Umbrella."
5,Genius,"Im more of a country fan myself but i accidently purchased this album when trying to buy Billy Ray Cyrus album ""Some Gave all,"" also an excellent album. But myself and some friends at the Christian ministry decided to put this on and my God it was brilliant. We initially put devil and the deep blue sea on and for a few moments i actually thought i was listening to Billy Ray Cyrus. Then we played the rest of the album and it was joyous and wonderful. A truely awe inspiring album with excellent lyrics."
4,A Great Product for a Great Price,I purchased this Memorex as an alternative for Sony Original DVD. It is performing well and so far I have no complaints. I had rewritten one CD three times now and the quality is still really good.
3,So tiny!,"These 'youth' shin guards are very small! Maybe 9"" long? Work well, but more was expecting them to be a little bigger. Great value though!"
4,Foam Padding Rips Too Easily,"I use these to protect the back of my leg from the occasional slap/wrist shot that misses the front of my hockey shin pads....obviously not their intended use. Nonetheless, they work great at giving me a little better protection when I decide to turn my foot to block a shot and it happens to nail my calf area right above my ankle.My only beef with this product is the padding ripped way to easily on one of the pads. I gave it a small tug and off came a decent size piece. I'm guessing a little kid using these for soccer would just as easily rip them up while taking them off.The price was right though, so I can live with cheap padding."
4,"The 1974 Magickal Childe Edition of ""A True & Faith Relation""","This is the original Magickal Childe edition of Stephen Skinner's reproduction of Meric Casaubon's ""True & Faithful Relation"" from almost 40 years ago; last year a newly re-edited and reconstructed edition was produced and is available asDr. John Dee's Spiritual Diaries: 1583-1608(from Llewellyn) andDr John Dee's Spiritual Diaries (1583-1608) A True & Faithful Relation of What Passed for Many Yeers Between Dr John Dee... & Some Spirits...Revised Edition(from Skinner's own Golden Hoard Press). The new edition is MUCH better, and HIGHLY reccomended for both the Student and the Adept. A quarter-leather limited edition was available at the time of the writing of the review directly from the Golden Hoard Press website, and will be highly collectable."
2,Breaks Easily,"Though this is an attractive basket, it will not stay together. It claims to be able to hold up to ten pounds, but mine has broken with only a few tomatoes in it. The first time it broke, a link on the chain had come open. I fixed the link and re-hung the basket. That happened twice more and I fixed it the same way.If it stayed together it would be very functional.I'm going to go to the hardware store and see if I can find any chain that will fit it. If that doesn't work, it's going in the trash."
1,DONT BUY THIS ITEM,Broke the first time I used it......Too bad..Not made well....I only put a couple of lbs of fruit.
2,Cheap is cheap,I only paid $13 for this hanging wire fruit basket. It does the job that it was made for but is very cheap and plain.
5,a sentimental journey into the soul of a poet,"The Spectral Boy is a beautiful collection of poems that I cannot forget. I still have my autographed copy from years ago when I had Don Petersen as an English instructor at SUNY Oneonta. I have read these poems so often and used them in my own English class with my students. The response to poetry is a very personal one, a visceral response. These poems deserve to be read thoroughly. You will find these voyages into the past to be stirring, others to be heartbreakingly beautiful recollections of experiences that are recalled but are beyond recall."
5,JULIE BUDD,"I give all five stars to the wonderful performer, ""JULIE BUDD.""I wish there would have been even more focus but this introducedher to audiences.When you see her perform you will sadly ask why didn't she becomea ""DIVA."" Sadly compared to Streisand, and have seen her in clubs,and have her dvds, this is a talent that needs to be reconized for""that voice.""And this should have led to many film/theatre roles."
1,DVD,"DVD was not described as being sold as out of region. This DVD will not play on my DVD player. Next time, you should include this info."
3,"Loved the movie, quality lags","Loved the movie when we saw it at the theatre, and was overjoyed to find I could buy it. Julie Budd's rendition of Roses and Rainbows"" has haunted and inspired me for years. There is just one annoying problem, the video and audio are not synced. I'm not sure if I got a bad copy or if all the DVDs are the same."
2,Poor And Boring Movie.,"It's only merit is that is family friendly. I think. Since I was unable to watch the whole movie, due to overcoming boredom."
4,A Catholic Perspective,"I read this book as a Calvinist nearly a month before my conversion to the Catholic Church, ironically. The authors make a superb biblical analysis on the process of salvation, and it not being just a one time event. This opened me up to Catholic soteriology. The reason I gave these guys 4 stars is because I disagree with doctrine of the Perseverance of the Saints, (among other things) but I do think they argued for most things superbly. A job well done to the authors.I would recommend ""Not By Faith Alone"", by Robert Sungenis...he makes the same conclusions as these guys on the process of salvation, but takes biblical warnings not as conditional, but actual, as in, they could actually happen to a soul."
1,This book is highly overrated,"This book is horrible. I was required to read it along with A Prayer For Owen Meaning for AP English. From the beginning I found it unrealistic and predictable, like an after school special. The story is about Davy, Reuben's older brother, who kills two boys and escapes prison. The whole book is the Land family's adventure in a camper to find the outlawed member.Reuben doesn't believe that Davy should be in prison, although he is obviously guilty and should be punished. An investigator is mixed into the story, and Reuben blames him more than his own brother for trying to keep the family apart.This book is tiring. I was bored to tears after the first chapter. I don't recommend it."
1,Animal Suffering Not Appreciated,The reviews sounded good but I really disliked this book. I struggled through shooting and wounding a snow goose and skipped many pages to try and avoid the awful details. Started reading again and they were out hunting Canadian geese. That was enough for me. I have no intention of continuing this book and would advise anyone who does not like to read about suffering animals to not even try it.
2,I DON'T GET IT?,"A GOOD FIRST TRY. GOOD WRITING, BUT NOT MUCH OF A 'STORY'. I THINK HIS NEXT WILL BE BETTER. TRY WILLIAM KOWALSKI'S 'EDDIE'S BASTARD' INSTEAD."
1,a bad start,"This book starts out with an offensive story about hunting, a cruel and cowardly activity, in which the protagonist, as a child, celebrates the experience of wounding a goose which, having been lured down to seek companionship with the decoys it takes to be its bretheren, is then chased across a field - painful and terrified - until it is tackled and torturously killed. What a pleasant story. Anyone who isn't offended by this activity needs to have their head examined."
2,a matter of taste,"This book came highly recommended to me by a long time friend I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as she did. There is a very persistent and deep religious theme which might appeal to a lot of people but which I found tiresomeThe author tries to achieve a combination of Mark Twain americana and a strain of magical realism but the writing style wears thin. The narration is from the point of view of an 11 year old boy who is a sympathetic character but it has a tone of irony which is unconvincing for the time and place and the charactersThe basic story is too thin for the number of pages and stream of consciousness taken to tell it and rather than wishing it would never end I found myself thinking ""WILL it never end?""Nonetheless, I think for a reader less analytical and more sentimental than I am, it would be a totally satisfactory, memory piece I can see why some reviewers are rhapsodic, but it didn't have that affect on me."
4,Peace Like a River,"A beautiful, lyrical book, Peace Like a River does live up to the hype. I enjoyed the story, particularly Rube's honest voice, which drives the novel. The book has spiritual overtones; the characters' lives are directed by an unseen force, the father is a man of profound faith, and Reuben is in fact ""touched"" in the end. So naturally,when my husband informed me that ""Peace Like a River"" was the name of a hymn, it didn't come as too much of a surprise. And I'd just thought that was how reading it made you feel!"
3,A Nice Change,"I had to read this book as a summer reading book for school. I personally thought it was a nice refreshing change. I am a christian and normally in school we read books about pessimists and people who don't believe in God which, I mean, is ok and everything but it gets to be very depressing. Then all of a sudden we have this book to read which is so spiritually uplifting. ALthough the book was hard to understand and (which was the reason I gave it a 3) I enjoyed the religious change. It was funny to me though how in school everyone freaked out over having this book to read. They said it was too religious, even though we read religious books all the time. The only difference is that instead of the story being about atheism and people who hate religion and anyone who practices religion, it was about faith and believing in the truth."
5,Peace Like A River,"I am a bit suprised by all the bad reviews. I read this book because I have to write a paper on it, but now I find myself unworthy. It was such a beautiful book that I fear I cannot do it justice in a paper. This book really moved me. I laughed and cried. Without a doubt this should be on your reading list. Read it at a time when you need to be reassured there is goodness in the world. This book will not fail you.I do agree a bit with some of the reviews on Swede. She doesn't represent an average nine year old, but it in no way ruins the novel."
4,complex love,"Enthusiastic Recommend: Peace like a River, by Leif EngerThe story this book tells is fantastical beyond belief. It could never happen. But I didn't really realize this until I started to relay the plot to my husband when he asked what I was reading. (He does not read fiction - too frivolous. And this book's plot certainly didn't help change his mind about fiction.) But that's not the point. The point is the characters, their relationships, and their decisions. My favorite is Swede, the little girl, though the dad is the miracle-working hero, and the narrator, Swede's brother Reuben, is the work of miracles. This family deals with tragedy and hope, moral dilemmas and unconditional love in complex ways that ring true and touch the soul. I've never read anything quite like this. I'm usually not one for ""suspension of disbelief"" on this level, but you should do it this one time, at least."
5,Peace Like a River,"This book circulated through our reading group and everyone loved it. Just as one thinks he has the story line figured out, something unexpected happens. The end was a total surprise. Just read and enjoy!"
5,gotta have it,"I read this library book twice and decided I had to have it in my library. The style, insights, characters, and plot are all original. Like poetry, it merits re-reading."
4,This grabbed my attention from the beginning.,"The very first chapter of this book caught my heart; when I reached the second chapter I turned back to the first chapter and read it again, just for the beauty of it. (Swede has a moment with a goose that is so well captured, I can't even put words to it.)The second to last chapter of the book is out of swing with every other chapter in Peace Like a River, and it bothered me. Most of the book is a story that you're following along with, but this chapter was very much like one in The Last Battle by CS Lewis when everyone runs toward paradise. Very weird and out of sync.From the event the night that Davy goes to jail onwards, I had no idea how the book would end or how any closure could occur. It happens, but not in a way that I would ever expect."
3,Good story albeit provincial in tone,"Nary is there a swear word within Peace Like a River. Now it isn't a bad thing for a modern novel to not contain anything above a ""damn""(if that), but it gives the idea of tone. If you're easily annoyed by religious imagery, you want to skip this one. It doesn't beat you over the head but it comes back again and again and honestly it annoyed me.But, this is a good story, it kept me reading, although like many other reviewers I did think it was padded with quite a bit of filler that I read without really taking in.There is a preciousness to the novel similar to a movie of the week on lifetime that seemed suited more to a young adult audience(if it wasn't so long).Anyway I give it three starts because it certainly isn't a bad book or even just fair. It is just good."
3,Charming,"Just when your faith in faith is about to go out the window, along comes Leif Enger's tender hearted book that as more than one person has pointed out, feels very much like a contemporary ""To Kill A Mockingbird"". Our narrator, Reuben Land is both a witness to miracles, and the recipiant of one at the hand of his father. His life in 1960s North Dakota takes a dramatic turn when his brother kills two men who break into their house. The novel is sweet, and well written and liable not to offend anyone. At times it feels like part Bible story, and part old fashioned Western which figures prominantly as a theme for Rueben's sister.Somehow when I started the book I think I was expecting more of a payoff, which for me never really came. Still it's a pleasant and charming first novel."
3,Peace Like a River,"This book reminds me of a modern day Grapes of Wrath. It was a bit difficult to follow the story and not what I would call an easy read. Parts of the storyline did not really relate to others, in my opinion."
5,A Feast for the Soul!,"I was hooked from the very first page! Leif Enger has a gift of storytelling. I was entralled by the tapestry of words and the charming characters. Swede is a sharp, precocious young girl who reminded me of Scout Finch from ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". The book flows well, is easy to follow, and is hard to put down! I was seriously aghast to discover there were those who did not like this book, or who found it boring. (I guess everyone isn't blessed with a healthy, vivid imagination.) Who cares how believable it is that a nine-year-old girl can write so well and have such a vast vocabulary? If every fiction book must be absolutely believable, then Harry Potter wouldn't have been so successful! This book made me want to read more. It made me want to slow down and enjoy simple pleasures. It made me long for a deeper faith and to experience miracles! That makes this more than qualified to be a ""good read"" for me!"
5,please read this amazing book!,"this is such a wonderful book, that it has been placed in my top 5 favorite books of all time! mr. enger has a gift for creating real and completely lovable characters. the story was moving, uplifting, sad and fascinating. the tone of the story was similar to that of ""to kill a mockingbird"" which is my favorite book ever. that probably has an influence on my love of ""peace like a river."" you will enjoy this book and be so moved by its characters and their lives. please read it!"
4,Upstream,"Why am I venturing against the River current by awarding a ""mere"" 4 stars? The book was really good in places, but lagged in others. What was the point of the over-long 2nd grade epic ""Western"" poem?Mr. Enger is not a Northern-lighted Harper Lee (""To Kill a Mockingbird."") The journey of the Land family is inspirational and well worth your time, but he's not Steinbeck and they're not the Joads (""The Grapes of Wrath."")""River"" is far better, though, than ""Plainsong"" or ""The Shipping News"" because it is real fiction without the pretensions of the latter books to be `avant garde"" or ""artsy."" But there's no need to return to THAT soap box now. Read ""River."" It is a fine ""Regional Book"" that transcends the region."
3,Did I miss something?,"Why did this book seem so hokey to me and not to others? Is it because I'm not from farm country, not religious, not wholesome? If Norman Rockwell had been a novelist, he might have written this book. That being said, some of the writing is truly striking, and a character who appears toward the end of the book -- Jape something -- is unique and creepily convincing, something out of a David Lynch movie."
5,Read this Book!,"There was a wrong-headed review of this first novel today in the NY Times Book Review. Ignore it. This is a wonderful book set in the early 60's in rural Minnesota. Jeremiah Land, the father of three children and a man touched by God, is the hero of this book which is told through the eyes of his middle child, Reuben, then eleven years old. I am not particularly spiritual, but to enter fully intpo this book is to be swept up in marvelous writing and into a world where the northern plains and the miraculous, against all odds!, intersect beautifully and convincingly. Wonderful characterizations abound: Jape Waltzer, a horrid villain; Reuben's sister Swede, a tough little poetess; Roxanna, a late-appearing saint--the list goes on! Suspend disbelief and read this with an open heart."
5,This is a world you dearly want to enter,"I read this book in Mongolia, and it didn't matter. I was instantly transported to a fascinating time and place by a brilliant writer. This one has stayed with me--the characters, the story, the setting, the mood are that good. Everyone I've given it to has loved it, and I've given it a lot."
4,Great mix of emotions,"This book surprised me -- I didn't know it was going to take me home to North Dakota. I bought it on the recommendation of Publisher's Weekly -- a promising new author with a good book. I read it in two days! I enjoy the way Enger tells the story of a family we have all known -- love, tragedy, disfunction, support for each other. The story kept me wondering, not at all predictable. Although I expected the mother to surface, it didn't really matter whether she did or not. The young girl's amazing skill at writing was a delightful addition and gave a balance to the sadder aspects of the story.Enger does a terrific job with imagery: burning lignite, the Badlands, federal agents, a little girl writing poetry, a father's direct line to the Almighty, bird hunting and a family finding more than they are seeking.I recommend this book for anyone who appreciates vivid detail, a bit of the unbelievable and a romp across southern North Dakota."
2,Slow and Boring,"Oh Dear! Have you ever read a book that the words, spoken in a monotone voice, lulls you to sleep? That is my synopsis of ""Peace Like a River"". I did enjoy the spiritual side of this story but was slowly lulled to sleep every time I attempted to read it. I wouldn't suggest you pick up this novel unless you need a good long nap."
4,It's about sowing a culture of peace early,I think this book is about sowing a culture of peace early and I recommend it to parents who understand that anything other than peace is dehumanizing. Books like this are good gifts in place of toys. That's why family-friendly events like the August 1-6 International Read For Peace Week encourages young and old to read nonviolent books with others for at least 1 hour.
1,Am I The Crazy One??,"That's the question that I've been asking myself after I read all the fabulous reviews for this book and then actually read the book. IT'S NOT THAT GOOD!! I read other people's reviews and found myself agreeing as well as disagreeing with many things said. Overall though, this book has no point and is completely random. I have no problem suspending my disbelief for a literary sake...i.e. fine, I didn't completely question the ""miracles"" that occurred in the book, but they are NEVER EXPLAINED! Why can the father ""talk to god""? It makes no sense to me. Furthermore, I found myself reading as fast as I possibly could just to get to the end of the book. I read A LOT of books and unless one is absolutely horrible, I will stick with it to the end. That's what I did with this book. So, let me save you innocent readers some time and recommend that if you want to read a story with a point and one that makes any sense, DON'T READ THIS ONE!!"
1,Boring and not believable,Had to read this book for Book Club. I have only one word: Yawn. I couldn't get into the characters nor the plot. I found the so-called miracles completely unbelievable and couldn't wait for the last page to appear.
1,mawkish,"silly, mawkish, trite, stereotypical. So many adjectives to apply to this poor novel. Was there a plot? I couldn't find it. I couldn't finish it either."
1,Save Your Money!,"This book is utterly boring, and the reader adds to the monotony. Perhaps any reader would have similar problems with this subject matter. The author strains to find unusual adjectives to modify almost every noun. Many of them are laughable; not funny, just laughable! The tiniest event takes page after page of detail writing. You will see what I mean when you finally come to the end. It drags on and on! Sorry, but that is how both my wife and I evaluated it."
1,Can I give it zero stars?,"This book starts out with an offensive story about hunting, a truly cruel and cowardly activity, in which the protagonist, as a child, celebrates the experience of wounding a goose which, having been lured down to seek companionship with the decoys it takes to be its bretheren, is then chased across a field - painful and terrified - until it is tackled and torturously killed. What a pleasant story. Anyone who isn't offended by this needs to have their head examined."
5,Loved it,"Breathtaking prose, a page-turning plot, fascinating characters, unique settings, and a fabulous narrative voice. Leif Enger demonstrates astonishing insight into human character that left me laughing and weeping, sometimes in the same breath. What a story!Sandra Glahn, author, Lethal Harvest"
3,"Def. Worth Reading, but patchy at the end","The first 4/5 of the book is beautiful and engaging -- the ending is less so, but more importantly, feels like it was written by another author altogether for another book altogether.Still in all -- I liked it very much."
5,Can I give it 6 stars?,I'm an avid reader and this might just be my favorite book of all time. Leif Enger's writing is so beautiful and the story so touching that I found it difficult to read anything else for several days.
5,Peace Like a River was one of the best books!,"Peace Like a River was recommended by my good friend, so happy I took her advise and read this. To me it was inspirational, I absolutely loved it. I would say it is one of the best books I've read in a very long time."
4,Word master weaves a great story!,"Enjoyed the writer's style, able to paint word pictures in a intriguing way. Story line easily keeps your attention. Characters well developed and varied. His speculations about spiritual matters invite the reader to ponder personal perceptions. Very good read!"
5,Awesome book - one to ponder for a long time,"This book exceeded all expectations and is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Reuben, the 11 year old narrator, takes us through twists and turns, just odd enough to to mimic real life. Enger does a wonderful job of interspersing literary allusions and assumes a basic knowledge from his reader. The climactic scene towards the end comes unexpectedly.Enger tells this tale of how the spiritual world of faith interacts so closely with this temporal world. It's a story just strange enough to be true and how I wish it were."
4,Entertaining and Thought-Provoking,"""Peace Like a River""--the title only really comes to full meaning in the penultimate chapter in this wonderful story. The writing is as much poetry as prose, both literally, as we read Swede's adventures for Sunny Sundown, and figuratively, with Engler's beautiful descriptions of sights, sounds, and feelings. I enjoyed the book, which I read for a book discussion group, very much, although I found myself a little impatient for events to move on at times. And Swede is an engaging little girl of 9 who captures one's heart, but, darn it all, I had trouble accepting her precosity at writing. At times her vocabulary is a bit unbelievable, but more so is her use of inverted sentences and interior rhyme for a child raised on the Western prose of Zane Grey and others and on the King James Bible. Even so, the story will grab your interest with its entertaining and unpredictable characters and beautiful writing."
5,I'm Impressed!,"It is hard to believe that this was a work of fiction. The narrator was so life- like and the family so realistic. I saw bits and pieces of my own family in this one and it made me remember the good times.I was waiting for the father to do something horrible, I was waiting for there to be abuse or something that broke the family apart, but throughout the entire book the family loved eachother and stuck by one another. By no means were they perfect, but even thought they had their own personalities you never doubted their love or respect for their family.I am not one to like ""miracles"" in books but these seemed to fit- and I found myself questioning these ""miracles"" as the narrator assumed I would. All in all a wonderful book and I recommend it without reservation!"
5,One of the best books I have ever read period.,"If you like to read a book and forget you are reading, forget where you are, what time it is, and that you are supposed to be somewhere else, then try this one. It is simply one of the best books I have ever read--best stories, best writing. I just purchased it for a friend who edited my own novel because I know she will love it as much as I did. It is funny, heartbreaking, poignant, always believable AND unimaginable. So sweetly written. I also purchased another of his books today and if it is half as good I'll be happy.Patrick Michael MurphyACROSS THE DESPERATE MILES"
5,Interesting book,"I usually have trouble finding good books to read, but this was actually pretty good. I usually don't like westerns or country type of stuff, but the book was interesting and exciting. After starting the book, I found myself wanting to keep on reading and know what happens in the end rather than dropping it. Which is pretty rare. I bought this because I needed it for school, but I'm glad the school made me read a good book rather than a boring one I'd have to keep forcing myself awake to read. I stayed up till five am reading this book because I couldn't put it down at one point. Anyways, the characters are unique and interesting, and the story has a twist later on that keeps things suspenseful. I kinda wish I could find another book like it."
2,Wear a sweater when you read this!,"Although the beginning grabbed my attention, I lost interest in the middle when it started to drag. I kept with it and finished, but was not thrilled overall with this book. I didn't relate well to any of the characters, and felt myself pitying them more than respecting them.The best thing I can say about this book is that the author's descriptions of the cold, cold, cold Midwest made me so cold that I put on socks and wrapped a blanket around me when I was reading this! Maybe this would be good to read this summer when it's in the 90s."
4,a feel good book,"It's not exactly a page turner, but we don't always want that, right? It really is a lovely story of love and faith."
2,A Disappointment,"I was rather bored during the reading of this book. The story the author tried to tell was interesting, but told in a slow and dull manner. What some may find descriptive, I found horribly boring and I repeatedly found myself saying GET TO THE POINT."
2,Boring and Long Winded,"I was so excited to read this book but what a disappointment! It started off well I thought, with an interesting story told by an 11 year old boy. However, unfortunately for me, I didn't realize how much I actually hated this book until I was over half-way through, so decided to just finish it hoping the ending would be spectacular enough to save it. Once again, extremely disappointed. While others have very justified problems with the overzealous language and overused literary quotes, and the ridiculous aspect of the father performing miracles, my main problem with this story was that it was simply so ANTI-CLIMATIC. Every time something bad or dramatic happened, it would still all work out. People get caught but always narrowly manage to get away, they got shot but not fatally or even brutally injured. It was as if the book was for an eleven year old instead of told from the point of view of one. Bottom line, don't waste your time."
2,Overrated!,"Reading this book was a painful experience. I really don't see what everybody is raving about. There was not a lot of creativity, most of the characters were weak, and it has a forgettable story.Lots of people talk about the book being about faith. It's actually closer to scifi."
3,One edit away from a masterpiece,"A poetically told tale that was actually much better than it was written. The dialogue is smooth and flowing, but the character development was rocky and many of the central characters were never brought to resolution. Too much instrospection for the children and not enough emotionalism. However, the narrative passages were exquisite. It seems to be a novel where the author should have taken one more crack to work out the bugs, so that the mechanics of the book worked. In spite of this, I would still recommend it---just not highly."
3,Possibility vs. Plausibility,"A novel may depart from the realm of the possible, as this book does, but it must retain a strong plausiblity. That Leif Enger has not achieved. Sentimentality should not submerge ethical issues. It does here. Davy killed a wounded man by an execution-style bullet in the back of the head. Rueben's covering for his brother leads to the death of the FBI man Andreeson. I will commend the author for his vivid portrayal of Western South Dakota--an area I love, in summer--and the two characters I liked best, Roxanna and (fleetingly) Sara. Is this book some great favorite among American evangelicals?"
2,Miracles and Murder,"Reading more like a story of the 30's than the 60's, this story dried up half way down the course. A father who performs miracles, a son who becomes an escaped murderer and the North Dakota landscape, are not enough to hold interest. Detailed prologue to climaxes, that lack detail and are no more than summaries of action, dilute an interesting effort."
2,Mostly Tedious,"Maybe I missed something. This book came highly recommended by people whose opinions I trust. I found it tedious. The main character and his father were unsympathetic. Mostly they left me flat. His younger third grade sister had a genius all out of proportion with reality. The first few pages captured me, the remainder left me difting. The writing itself was terrific, but the characters and story line left much to be desired."
5,Happy,Book was in new condition. I was very happy with my purchase. Also came in a timely manner! I strongly suggest this seller!
2,Too much hype,"Being from Minnesota, I thought from all the hype that I would like this book, but I quit after three chapters. Comments about this book were very misleading and are one of the worst examples of the growing tendency for editors and promoters to write in this forum. The book is weak on plot and weak on characterization (Reuben's sister Swede is a sad example). The promoters--or the author, who may have written many of the comments from internet cafes--should let readers decide about the quality of his book."
2,PLeeeeze,"I've had enough of books with miracles and dead people looking down from heaven. Give me books like Atonement,No Great Mischief, and Exteriors. Let us think!"
3,Lowe blow,"This is a likely a great book to read, but let me say that the audiobook version read by Chad Lowe is horrendous. Lowe's geeky, ""awe shucks"" voice makes every character sound weak and pathetic. He especially makes the narrator sound like a feeble whiner and the father comes off dull and spineless. It created for me a situation whereby I was not able to identify with any of the characters. The story itself is great, although I felt the plot lingered on far too long than it needed to before it came to resolution. The beginning is great, but then seems to get lost in the story of side characters and other tangents. I will admit that it may have been my irritation with Lowe's dorky voice and my desire for the story to end quickly. Read the book, loss the tapes."
2,Obviously a debut novel,"Two stars might be a generous rating for a book I couldn't even finish. The plot and premise of the novel were very appealling to me, and I really wanted to like this book. However, the narrator's voice distracts the reader from getting into the heart of the story. Enger's presentation of Reuben constantly takes you out of the story to unrelated and uninteresting tangents. The depiction of sister Swede is unbelievably precocious and also distracting. Davy is the best character in the novel but unfortunately he disappears after the third chapter.As a reader, I could definitely tell that this was a debut novel, and it wasn't worth it to me to even finish."
3,"Competently written, but ultimately unsatisfying","Leif Enger clearly knows how to turn a sentence, but his debut novel suffers from a number of flaws.First of all, the book should have been edited down by about a third. The pace creeps along in places, and Enger's description-heavy prose can grow tiresome.More importantly, the ending of the book leaves much to be desired. Without giving away too much, I'll just say that Davy's fate is largely inconsistent with the book's themes of righteousness, redemption, and moral behavior."
5,engrossing,"I read constantly, and this is the best book I've read in a long time. Good fiction is hard to find these days. I don't know what category this falls into, but I found the writing poetic and lyrical. The characters were endearing and believable. The ending was a bit of a surprise, but it was not hard to live with. Highly recommended."
5,"A heartwarming , beautifully written masterpiece","This book was recommended to me from someone who's opinion I trust. I am so glad I read it. It is a simple story about a good man that just happens to perform miracles from time to time, his eldest son Davey, his expressive daughter Swede and our story's narrator, 11 year old Reuben. A series of tragedies unfold within the family that necessitates a journy where miraces begin to happen and change the lives of the whole family. This is a story that stays with you. I keep thinking about the story and the characters even though I finished the book several days ago. Highly recommended!"
5,this book touched my heart... perhaps even my soul,"Love it or hate it? Only you will know, if you decide to read it. I strongly recommend this book for its lyrical writing, humor, insights, and ultimately, the way it drew me in and wove a compelling fabric that snared my heart, made me care about the characters and their story as it unfolded. Perhaps those not touched by tragedy or redemption in their own lives cannot relate to such a story, but I found it irresistible... it touched my heart and provided much food for thought, long after the book was finished. I'm not particularly ""Christian"", but miracles can and do happen, and I've witnessed several in my life. As the main character often says, ""Make of it what you will."""
4,A spiritual read,"Reuben Land, an 11 year old asthmatic is our storyteller. He relates how his life changed after his brother, Davy gunned down two hooligans in cold blood. Rube's sister, Swede is a writer and throughout the novel we are treated to her writings of westerns and outlaws, which is a parallel to the fact that her brother Davy escaped the law, and is on the lam.The spiritual side of this story lies with Rebuen's Dad, Jerimiah Land. Small miracles occur when Mr. Land is around; and we the reader, can witness his faith, and his link to God.I don't want to give away any plot or ending, but the further I read into this story, the more I liked it. It brought me comfort and aroused my own faith. Overall, I give this book 4 stars."
1,I hated this book,"I guess I'm in the minority, but I hated this book. I think the story line is disjointed and the characters, by and large, are underdeveloped. The author didn't make me care very much about the characters and the ending was ridiculously contrived."
1,had to struggle to finish this one,The excessive use of Swede's western poetry made this book a tedious read for me. Was given this book as a gift so I made myself finish it. Would not recommend it to anyone.
1,I really tried...,"Since purchasing this book, I have tried reading it 3 different times. I'm glad to see that I am not the only reader who doesn't understand all the hoopla about this novel. Tedious is not even the word for it. Peace Like a River is painstakingly boring."
1,Only the 2nd book I could not finish!,"I could not get through this book. It required a dictionary on almost every page. I think the author wrote this with a Thesaurus to be original. Original he was, I got to page 127 and said that is enough! The story line did not flow at all. The author makes a 9 year old girl talk and sound like an adult.I read the previous reviews before I purchase this book. I must have gotten the wrong book, but the author and title are the same. Sorry I do not agree with the previous reviews."
2,Disappointing read,"Like another reviewer, I am shocked at the attention this novel is receiving. Lacking believability, even miracles aside (which I do believe are possible), the topper is the daughter, Swede. There is no way that any nine year old can do all the things that she does. Please understand that I can ""go along"" with the idea for the sake of the story, but it came to be ridiculous after a few chapters. Moreover, the fundamental problem of the novel, the son's crime, could easily have been solved in so many other ways using the father's powers of will, prayer, and miraculous intervention. It was just too silly and convenient for the author to selectively use such character traits only when they suited his rather thin plot.The weaknesses aside, the author does know how to turn a phrase and many passages are a pleasure to read for their descriptive power."
2,Very disappointing: could not see it through,"At first, I was touched by the beautiful writing and the brother-sister relationship. The Western poetry is an admirable twist. But in the long run, I just could not finish this book. The pieces did not gel together for me. I didn't care enough about the characters to care how they wound up.A MUCH better book with a similar brother-sister relationship is THE BOTTOMS by Joe Landsdale. That title won an Edgar but never received the press it deserved. If you insist on trying Peace Like a River, go for it, but purchase a copy of THE BOTTOMS as well."
1,"5 stars, people? Were you sleeping when you read it?","First, I can't believe this book has gotten so many good reviews?!!! It was boring. It was uninteresting. I would have stopped reading somewhere in the beginning if it wasn't for part of a book club I am in. The ending ruined the whole thing for me. It just seemed to have NO emotion at all in it. When things happened, without giving anything away, people should have been devastated, hurt, crying, mad, vengeful. There was none of that. It was emotionless. It left me feeling empty and not finished. The ending was so abrupt. I would say it left me wanting more, but the only ""more"" I want now, is a totally different book!!"
5,Read and Reread,"This is a book of many layers and I enjoyed reading it so much I reread it immediately after! I was in Montana and the Badlands at the same time as the setting of this book and the cowboy slant is true of the time. I laughed at many parts including ""ratfink"", I had forgotten that word! The great story and spiritual reflection is outstanding."
5,A classic,"This book follows a family's troubles through everyday life, and the author throw in a couple of miracles along the way. This book might be a little complex in the beginning, but stay with it, it is a great book."
2,Sleeps like a River,I really wanted to like this book and thought I would after reading the rave reviews. I have not totally finished it yet but I dread picking it up every night trying to finish it. I really want to like it and there are times in the book when it moves a little quicker but I have to agree with many that it just could not hold my interest. I was able to relate to the characters but the plot was just too slow. I am still trying to decide if I will force myself to read the last 40 pages or so.
4,Couldn't Have Found Better,I read this book for school. I thought I wouldn't enjoy but I proved myself wrong. I reccomend highly this exciting read.
3,Sacrifice: the Story of a Journey to Peace,"In Peace Like a River, Enger masterfully captures the thrilling tale of two highly intelligent youngsters and their beloved father as they pursue their escaped convict brother, Davy. The Lands grow as a family as they trek through the North Dakota badlands in search for their ""wrongly accused"" brother. Both obvious and obscure examples of religious symbolism fill the pages of Peace like a River. The conflict, when noticeable, intrigues the reader and pulls the story line together exceptionally. Peace Like a River shows the main character's true connections with one another through reoccurring themes such as self sacrifice and unconditional love. This, in addition to some good old fashioned western adventure and a first-class set of surrounding characters, ranks Leif Enger's Peace Like a River at 3 stars out of five."
4,Overall a great book,I have had this book in the read pile for a long time. I actually tried to even start reading it once before didn't get past the first 20 pages. I'm glad that on my second attempt to read Peace Like a River I gave it a more fair chance. I found it slow moving in the beginning but soon I found myself really caring about all of the characters. Having 11 year old Reuben narrate makes the story even more interesting because you wonder if his point of view is true - or how it seems to an 11 year old. This book is very spiritual and spirituality guides a lot of decisions in the book. I believe in miracles - but I also wonder again if the miracles that happen in the book were real or events that were misunderstood by a child. I lean towards real.This book is not perfect. It moves really slow at points but overall it is a great read. I also think it would make a great movie!
4,Peace Like a River,"This book has a little bit of everything...at first, I had trouble staying interested because not a lot seemed to be happening, but then something did and everything that came after was just sort of beautiful...words you sometimes have to think about. Peace Like a River. Yes."
4,a must read.....,"please read all the 5 star reviews on this book. I can not add to these reviews except to say that this book belongs in your personal library. Beautiful prose, characters, worth keeping!"
4,A magical adventure in faith and family love,This book takes the reader on an exciting adventure thru the eyes of an eleven year old boy Reuben. I could hardly put it down and when I came to the end I was definitely not disappointed. If I had any criticism it would be not knowing more about the character of the older brother Davy. This book was one of the best books I have read in awhile. It really speaks of faith and family love and the yearning we all have to transcend everyday life and see miracles in our midst.
2,A reader from Denver,"I was given this book as a gift by a friend who is an avid reader and who I respect greatly. Thus, I was greatly disappointed by the ""rambling"" style of the author. The beginning few pages interested me and I had high hopes for the rest of the book, however, I quickly became bored with the incredible intelligence (??) of eight year old Swede and, as previously stated, just a rambling, boring read. I did notice in reading the reviews that most of the five stars were women and the lower ratings were men. As a woman, this both surprised and disappointed me."
5,great for book club.,My book club loved reading and discussing this novel. Three generations of our family have read it. We have had great discussions about the characters and the ending. Everyone sees something different. Will make a great movie. A delightful thinking book.
2,hard to connect,"The prose is a joy to read, but I could not connect with the characters and after a while found them tedious. Although lighter fare, I found ""A Miracle for St. Cecilia's"" by Katherine Valentine a more satisfying read."
2,Peace Like a River,"Peace Like a River is probably one of the most boring books I've read. Maybe I'm just too young to appreciate it, or just the fact that I like quicker moving stories, but it seemed to drone on and on about the same topic for multiple pages. Although the plot was interesting, it probably would have been much better if the author had not lingered on the same subjects (some of which were not relevant to the story.) This book had the potential to be good, but was screwed up during the writing process by someone who (not trying to accuse anyone of anything) probably wanted to fill up a bit more space. The plot was intended to be inspirational, and would appeal more to those who need to be inspired. I would not reccomend buying Peace Like a River unless you can handle slower moving stories. Otherwise, it's always available at the library."
2,I thought it would never end,"Enger did a wonderful job of choosing the language of this book. In that respect it was beautifully written. However, I found it to be quite an unusual book with odd characters that did not seem ""real"" to me. The plot was slow-paced and usually that is fine with me, but in this case I found it to be boring. There were many ""side stories"" that the narrator told that had very little to do with the main plot. Frankly, I thought this book would never end. My book club, composed mainly of teachers, did not enjoy this book. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,feast of july --- my favorite movie that nobody knows,"This is an amazing film --- exquisitely executed, shot and acted with a simple story and gorgeous period detail --- both Embeth Davidz & Ben Chaplin are brilliant.I saw this movie twice in the theatres because it was such a ""gem"" and then nobody was interested --probably because there were no stars in it --- but see it,,,,it's a tragic and beautiful love story. Pay special attention to the cinematography which is extraordinary.steven"
4,Finally!,"I searched high and low for this movie and finally found it on DVD. Happy to add it to my collection. It's a lovely, but sad movie about a young woman who finds herself alone and pregnant. On her search for her baby's father, she is taken in by a family that has three sons, all of whom fall in love with her. She makes her choice, but there are consequences."
2,Feast of July,"Very disappointed in this movie, especially James' uniform. I found his uniform to be quite annoying. Did not care for the plot, very depressing movie."
1,Tedious TRASH,"Depicts Marilyn as a naive dumbe blonde, with that breathy voice, which was only an act pushed by the studios. It doesn't even have her hair color right. It's a man-hating revenge film. She undergoes endless abuse, including the ""casting floor"", but wins out in the end by becoming Mariyn the star.Terrible script; terrible acting. Not graphic, but there is some nudity. Not even the saving grace of an attractive cast to offset the bad quality. Misty Rowe is painful to watch as Marilyn Monroe- what a travesty! This is a very bad exploitation film, with little relation to reality."
1,THE WORST MOVIE EVER,"This is the worst movie of Marilyn Monroe ever. I did't even get to finish it and had to take it out and hope I can re-sell it, or even give it away. The actress who plays Marilyn looks like Reese Witherspoon, nothing like Marilyn. Don't waist your money buying this is pure junk."
4,Mist Rowe is Excellent in Underrated Marilyn Monroe Bio,I was shocked when I saw that Larry Buchanan had directed this as I had no idea he had any talent. This fun bio of Marilyn Monroe is surprising in it's accuracy as well as quality. Misty Rowe (of HEE HAW fame) is very good as Ms Monroe (and does some great nude scenes)...This movie has an undeserved bad reputation and has aged well. This one is worth seeking out and is really a better film than the similar one made for HBO a few years ago with Ashley Judd and Mia Sorvino sharing the title role
4,Awesome indie punk band from San Francisco!,"This album rocks! Engine 88 was one of the premiere local SF bands to see in the mid 90's around San Francisco. They toured with Counting Crows right before their breakup in the late 90's. Engine 88's singer used to sing in another band, Sordid Humor, with Adam Duritz. That album is pretty good too. The lyrics on all of Engine's albums are original, interesting and funny. I believe that the singer is an environmentalist and he uses a lot of his experiences in his lyrics. Definitely worth the few bucks you can pick this up used for. Other bands I'm into if it helps categorize Engine 88 are Catherine Wheel, Swervedriver, Mystery Machine, U2, Radiohead, Death Cab for Cutie and other indies..."
4,Amazing alternative/indie SF band worth having,"This album rocks! Engine 88 was one of the premiere local SF bands to see in the mid 90's around San Francisco.

4,Cute story.,"A little cow is unhappy with where she is, so she starts off for the other mountain. Along the way, she talks other animals into joining her. A simple story, but my two year old liked it."
2,I was expecting something bigger,"The item description lists: Product Dimensions: 3.1 x 0.2 x 10.6 inches. This must be referring to the packaging, because it is actually 1.25 x 1.25 inches. For its intended use this may be adequate. I had planned on using it as a planing float to refine wood joints (the teeth are very similar to these, but wood floats cost around $60). It works well in that function, but is too small to be practical."
4,Excellent First Novel,"A brilliant idea that was well written and better constructed than most first novels. Although I agree with a couple of other reviews that the main character's lack of decision/action did get annoying at times, I think it worked well as a way to introduce the reader to multiple facets of the storyline. I think this actually could have been fleshed out more--there were long stretches of time referred to that didn't really get the amount of work I would have liked. That's really my only complaint with the novel; I would have like a bit more explanation for the different characters' natures and motivations. I found myself inferring a lot of their personality traits without much evidence for my conclusions. Nevertheless, the worst part about this book is that there is NO sequel! Or any other books by a talented author!Definitely worth the read!"
3,Slowly rising,A slow beginning forced me to lay this book aside several times. An action novel with links to spies and governments throughout should be fast paced and moving. The author seemed to have an indecision whether the story should move towards a discovery of faith or be a pure spy thriller. In the end hitting stronger on the latter and making up for some early deficits. Still worth reading overall.
3,Blah.,"Dull prose, dull action, boring intrigue, dull descriptions, plot that could have been better, and annoying hero. To sum it up: dull book."
3,"INformation great, item description BAD","it says: Digital: 4 pagesand it's hardly Word count: 379., so it's 1 page long.Miguel Angel Gaspar is my brother, and I tough about buying this article, now I found out the the extract is half the prudct.Information is great but not what it says FOUR pages."
2,"Decent movie, bad video...","This version is recorded in EP. The sound quality is horrible. The image alternates between muddy and fuzzy. I'll assume the more expensive version is higher quality. The film itself is OK, though a bit preachy and heavy-handed."
5,A GREAT COLLECTON OF EPISODES,"This set is fantastic. It contains 36 one-hour episodes , all of which I strongly recommend. While the series itself was produced in the mid 1990's , the science fiction, the technology exploration, the concepts are all still cutting edge. The visual effects are expertly produced, these are movie-quality productions and the acting is excellent. I especially like that the actors take the material seriously and draw you in by making you care what happens to the individuals involved. Some of the episodes show what happens when mankind reaches too far into an unknown unexplored frontier of science, usually with catastrophic results, and other episodes show the greatness of pushing the envelope and reaching for the stars to discover news way to benefit mankind. The box set contains six double-sided DVD's all of which worked perfectly.- Mike S."
1,Damaging reputation,"As a fan I'm really tossing up wether MGM stands for Making Giant Money or Making Giant Mistakes either way I'm loosing faith that I will ever end up owning all episodes. As an egar a great fan Iam willing to pay whatever the cost for each full season as The Outer Limits will allways be my favorite series, but I think I will be waiting forever for the release. It's to hard to even piece it together when there are uncomplete seasons released with themed sets. Theres missing episodes and now double ups this will be the last release of the outer limits I will buy until a better solution comes along because if I'm continuing to pay for double ups so MGM can make there money I will be sourcing all my missing episodes another way."
3,Severely Disappointed,"I am in complete agreement with the other reviewers that it is just pitiful that MGM has decided to release this in piece-meal fashion. I love the Outer Limits series and it is a major disappointment not to be able to simply buy the complete series: season 1, season 2, etc. Whoever made the decision to release this fantastic series in this way should be fired after having their behind severely beaten!!! Oh, I'll probably buy them anyway as released; it just really bugs me!"
2,Disappointment,"This collection is a waste of time as it excludes many of theseries better episodes such as ""Tempests"" (outstanding), ""Lithia""(very sensual in it's original form SHOWTIME),""Alien Radio"" (spooky)among a host of other superior episodes.Perhaps some day they will issue the complete series as originallyaired on Showtime."
2,Cop-chop issue,"I think making theme chop-chop's is an unintelligent way of issuing a series. It must be the works of a marketing manager having no clue about quality.I haven't seen the series but is very intrigued and want to buy it. But when I buy something I want to get the complete works. Not a minced leftover by some surely ignorant editor (annoying those with a different taste). Any series issue ought to start chronological and be complete. If the studio wants to serve the low quality market segment, then by all means chop it up - afterwards. Please have a little self-respect, dear friends at the studio !!:o)"
4,Good six pack,"The turn of the millennium Outer Limits reboot had a hell of a run. If you don't want all 154 episodes, this six DVD collection is a good ""best of"" with different themes to sample some of the best story threads of the series."
3,Short Changed,"When I bought this disk set, I thought it was all the episodes placed in categories, I was wrong. They are just handpicked episodes, some good some duds. Now I have to try and find the original new series as it was broadcast."
2,Where are the complete seasons????,"I really liked this show and I wanted to begin purchasing the seasons on DVD. But, I guess there is someone that apparently does not want us to buy it that way which is very dissapointing I would feel much better about buying them packaged as themes if I knew for sure that ALL of the episodes would eventually be released but until I have that reassurance I think I will wait on this purchase."
1,Very Disappointed,"The Outer Limits-The New Series is one of the greatest science fiction/horror television shows that I've seen, and I've been patiently waiting for MGM to produce this show in DVD season sets as they have done for the original series. I am extremely disappointed in the decisions they have been making regarding the release of this series. I will NOT buy this 6 disc set. I reiterate the words of a previous reviewer when I say that people do enjoy this series and would probably buy this, but not when it's produced with such incompetent negligence and disrepect for the fanbase. I hope people will boycott this edition lest it be a subtle marketing ploy (often done by George Lucas with his orginal Star Wars movies) to hook devoted customers into buying this edition, and then to release a set in season format with additional episodes among those that have already been released. Get your act together, MGM."
1,"Wow, this really sucks!","I LOVE Outer Limits, but I ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT buy any DVD's until they release them season by season! Get smart MGM... Stop alienating your potential customers!"
2,"Awesome series, abysmal marketing ploy","I absolutely agree with reviewers who have criticized MGM for releasing ""The Outer Limits"" in thematic chunks. What's the point? When Showtime first aired this SF anthology series I was awed (of course, then the Sci-FiChannel purchased the franchize and drove it into the ground). So why this lame maketing device? Once the themes are exhaused, then what?""The Outer Limits"" was a remarkable anthology series, but what will happen to the many episodes that aren't thematically related to others? Or (unlikely as it seems), will all 100 episodes somehow be pigeonholed into thematic units? It makes no sense.Until this outstanding and unique series is released in the chronological order of their original airing and we can see this series as it was meant to be seen, I'd avoid these DVD releases."
1,theme based?,Having DVD's released in themes sucks. I will probably wait to buy it till it comes out season by season so that I can know I'll get every episode.Someone tell the movie company to change the way they are doing this.
3,Can Anyone Tell Me???,"Which, if any of The Outer Limits - The New Series, contains the episode(s) Final Appeal pts. 1 & 2? This 2 part episode is the one I've wanted since it aired in September 2000. Any information anyone could give me on this would really be appreciated. Thanks!I have not purchased this set and I really don't need to if it doesn't contain the episode I'm looking for since I have several of the other releases."
1,Missing important episodes,"I agree completely with those who expressed disappointment with lack of full season episodes. One of my favorite episodes from the Outer Limits New Series was with Brent Spiner (of STNG fame as Data). It involved aliens taking over the earth and Brent was a de-programmer and it has a surprise ending like much of the original OL's had. Anyway, it did not make the cut in this ""topic"" episode release. I will not buy OLNS until there are full season episodes."
2,Where is season 2?,"Damn, damn, damn. I love this show and got season 1 when it first came out. Where is season 2? I normally perfer to buy DVDs brand new. But this one. I'm settling for a used one."
1,boycott MGM,Outer Limits is my favorite series but nobody wants to watch just alien episodes and then robot episodes and then...I want them mixed up like the series originaly was. I am also disapointed that there are episodes missing. Until they come out with every episode in order I refuse to purchase even for $20.
2,There's no hope for MGM...,"Soooooooo..what about the customers (like myself) that already purchased the ""sex/science fiction"" and ""time travel/infinity"" series that were previously released???? Are we supposed to buy them all over again, just to get these other ""theme"" collections? MGM is insane. As another reviewer said, I wish I had recorded these episodes myself. No thanks MGM."
4,As advertised,"I purchased this cover for my '95 Nissan 300ZX and it fits like a custom-made glove. Easy to install and, when rolled, it stores compactly on the rear deck when not in use."
3,Very basic,"If you know anything about networks, protocols or general CompTIA Net+ knowledge, don't waste your time. This book just explains what a web server does and defines the different ways it does it. My suggestion would be to go for the NET+ books, they are bigger but have more depth of information. I rankd it a 3 because I was hoping it would explain more of how to set up a web server."
4,"Neat, easy to use, reliable & great for bedroom","We needed a small bedroom humidifier for the winter months to off set the effects of dry gas heat in our home. Needed something small, durable and easy to maintain & fill that is cost-practical.After reviewing a number of reports and talking with a friend who has one of these,we settled on it and have not been disappointed. Pleasant additional surprises are it's decor (fits right in with the room furnishings) and simple adjustment of operation."
2,lots a random snap shots,Somewhat interesting collection of old disconnected photo of random RVs. Not a lot of research on the various rigs on how they came about or what happened to them. Not much insight on how the industry evolved.
4,Unique features to this Guide,"This is a nice source for those of us who wonder how traditional print style guidelines apply to the web. Unlike many other books on web style which cover more of the visual aspects of putting web pages/sites together, this guide provides a solid reference on how to communicate your CONTENT to a web audience, in a format that suits the medium."
2,Not Practical Enough,"This book will be most useful for individuals new to the web and just starting out in designing web pages. The design principles are few and are obvious to anyone who has surfed the Internet. I found no ""forward-looking advise"" or ""deep principles of design"" as promised in the reviews."
