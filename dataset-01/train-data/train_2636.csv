4,"""Be sure to get a brand-new chin!""","The short was, as is usual, great (did you know that the narrator and the older speaker were one and the same?), but this was one movie that I just had trouble believing hadn't been edited by the MST3K people. If it hadn't included a short, I just wouldn't have believed RZC was in its original format, it was that jumpy. The host segments were lower than usual, but the riffs made up for it. I didn't understand what was supposed to be funny about ""I'm Cherokee Jack,"" and I personally would've used more Three Stooges jokes (""Nyah-ah-ah, this is almost as bad as when we were caught by the Nazis!"" ""Oh, a wise guy, eh?"" and where were the Stooge sound effects when Coleman Francis was pushing people around?) and done a little bit more with the ""Castro"" appearance (I loved ""Get...real...beard.""), but that's just a matter of taste. And what was the deal with the young woman in Cuba?""Hey, commies are cute!"""
2,So are they still in Cuba?,"This is not one of the funniest I've seen. Red Zone Cuba bores me to tears because it's disjointed as hell and I don't know what's happening, and M&TB just couldn't save it for me. Even the skits weren't all that great. Folks curious about MST3K might want to choose another episode."
5,Such pain,"Coleman Francis who also did Beast of Yucca Flats and Skydivers brings us Red Zone Cuba, which shows what happens when the U.S. tries to invade Cuba. This story is told in flashbacks by John Carradine who also sings the opening credits song, that will have your ears screaming in pain. Well through some lapping of footage they try to make it seem like a huge force is storming the Cuban shores, but its really only like 7 or 8 people. Coleman who also stars and 2 other guys get captured, witness an execution or two, they escape and get back to the states. Some guy gets thrown down a well and later these three guys get gunned down.This movie is so totally painful, but thankfully the MST3K crew makes it an oh so breezy experience. They shred everything in this movie, like Coleman's voice and lumbering oaf like presence, Carradine's voice, the jump cuts between scenes and the characters that seem to have no place in the movie. But its a very funny episode here and well worth buying."
3,Nice cheap jack,Purchased for changing golf cart tires....works well. I wouldn't mind using it on a small car but anything larger than that I wouldn't feel safe given it's small footprint.
2,WFB in Hell,"Buckley as Mephistopheles conniving for the soul of America - from enfant terrible' of the CIA's creature, the ""Conservative Movement"" - to old conjurer too pooped to Pope over the sinister Neocon realm he created.""Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven."" -- John Milton"
4,Infinite Psychedelia,"The language is truly beautiful in this book. Reading it feels like walking in a mysterious and luxurient tropical forest. Hoots, beeps, deep shades of green, flashing reds and yellows, sudden appearances - that is the undercurrent in this book. And just like in a rainforest, I got increasingly nervous the further I got and wanted to find a way out. The narrator in this story is a visionary young boy, who describes a couple of threatening happenings in his town. His father is aquitted for a murder he didn't commit, his mother rages through town to find him, the forest is being cut down and life flees from it. The fate of the two opposing characters - the black African Queen-like figure and the white Ambassador - is ornamented by the threatening and dreamlike (en)chanted events. A psychedelic combination."
3,A good score,"While listening to music, I like to have a score with me. This book is quite complete and clear. Listening to the music and have my thought flowing with music. This book helps me to understnad the harmony of these melodies."
1,A little much...,"I had high hopes for this book when I got it. I have alot of fears and thought it may help to read it. As a Christian, I thought the chapter on dreams was very odd. It actually says that all of our dreams are from God himself and if we have a dream we need to go back into that dream and analyze everything and talk to everything, including the lightbulb(That isn't a joke. It really says this) and ask, ""Lightbulb, why are you in my dream?"" According to them the bible talks of dreams and interpretations of dreams that God sent. I agree with that. But, I don't think every dream we have is necessarily one God is sending a message to us in. Most of us have had sinful dreams that I am sure God had nothing to do with. And, yes, in the bible times people had their dreams interpreted, but they didn't interpret them by themselves by talking to things in the dream. There was usually someone with the gift of interpreting. Anyways, this book was strange to me."
1,Terrible..,"I have recently fallen in love with the Jack Black products, but they got this completely wrong. It's like gel from the 80s, ""lightweight"" my butt. This makes your hair super stiff, and unlike most newer hair products, does not simply brush out. It leaves your hair feeling gritty and with all kinds of white residue. Gross. So upset I spent so much money on this junk, I could've gotten the same type of gel from Walmart for $0.99."
2,Was better before,"On my third bottle of this gel. It seemed great at first, good volume, goes on clean etc. But the last bottle I got of it seems a bit sour. Whereas I loved the aroma of this stuff at first, it now strikes me like they just didn't get the mixture right. Not sure if it's a bad batch or a change to the entire product.I will say that the Jack Black hand creme is an excellent product to which I am deeply committed. You can't go wrong there. As for this hair gel, I'm going back to Khiel's."
3,Ugly edition for a fine classic,"Space Ghost is cartoon history. It spawned other cartoons like Shazam, Myghtor, Herculoids orBirdman and the Galaxy Trio: The Complete Seriesin its own time and inspired BBatman: The Animated Series, Vol. 1more than 20 years into the future by way of Alex Toth's fantastic character design for the title character.It sure deserved a better rendition than this mere DOUBLE SIDED DISCS. And the last 2 episodes on SIDE B of Disc 1 are unwatchable due to a bad writing on the disc, maybe 'cause it was heated from writing side A or maybe both sides were recorded at the same time.If you have to have (scratch that) OWN Space Ghos on DVD (like me) buy it. Everybody else wait for a better edition."
3,New Point of View,"My memories of space ghost seem to be better than the actual show. While I still enjoy it, the enjoyment is less than my remembered enjoyment."
5,Space Ghost and Dino Boy,"This is the way to do it. All 20 episodes give you all the Space Ghost and all the Dino Boy stories from the original show in the one package. If you enjoyed Gary Owens' voice of Blue Falcon, in last year's Scooby Doo/Dynomutt Hour release on DVD, you'll think he's just right as the voice of Space Ghost too.This was Hanna-Barbera's first serious super hero show. Space Ghost, Jan and Jace, and monkey pet Blip respond to calls for help from their Ghost Planet, and tackle galactic threats like Metallus, Brak, Lurker, Brago and Creature King.The last six stories form a serial adventure, in which you'll see guest appearances by Shazzan, Moby Dick, Mightor and Herculoids, which is an obvious cue for subsequent releases of those characters' shows too.Here's hoping they put out the later series ""Space Stars"" (made in 1981, with Space Ghost, Herculoids, Teen Force, Astro and Space Star finales)."
4,THE ORIGINAL IS STILL THE BEST!,"This is the ORIGINAL series, not that coast-to-coast crap bastardization that raped our memories. The fun's all here; monsters/aliens, power bands, cool sound efx,and Gary Owen's voice. Dino Boy is pretty cool, too,predating both VALLEY OF THE DINOSAURS and LAND OF THE LOST by nearly a decade. Watch for an homage to the pterodactyl fight in ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. (which might have inspired this series in part). And there's a cool, informative documentary on the late Alex Toth and his influence on later series like BATMAN:THE ANIMATED SERIES and SUPERMAN:THE ANIMATED SERIES.So why 4 stars? Because the DVDs are double-sided discs, which means unwanted fingerprints and scratches (which were on mine but didn't affect the playing of the DVDs). Also missing, and mentioned by another reviewer, are the linking segments showing interaction between Space Ghost and Dino Boy. Otherwise, everything is intact. A must-have for fans of vintage Saturday morning superhero action toons!"
5,Excellent. Sure brings back memories.,Item was received promptly and in excellent condition. The animation looks great! Sure brings back the memories of sitting in front of the TV on Saturday mornings as a kid. Very enjoyable.
3,Sometimes memories are better than 'reality',"A little disappointing. Jonny Quest holds up better than Space Ghost after 40+ years. JQ serves up an occasional slice of 'cheese', but Ghost dishes it out in large, animated chunks. An episode or two at a time is about all I can take."
4,Sixties Kid,"Good quality, brought back great memoiries of Saturday mornings in the sixties. Just like Jonny Quest it encourged kids to aiways be honest and truthful. I sure don't care for the Japanese cartoons of today, TOO WIERD and unrealistic!!!"
4,Outdoor Heater,"Nice product, generating a lot of heat. Assembly instructions were very good, and the packaging was excellent, but the assembly process proved a bit more complex than anticipated. It took two people for several of the steps (such as hooking up the gas line nozzle to the burner nozzle). The tiny set screws in the upright stem holder may have slipped out during shipping -- do NOT throw any packaging away until you account for them! I have no idea why they do not include them as one of the shrink-wrapped, clearly-labeled assembly screws and bolts. The piezoelectric lighter is hit-or-miss, although that may be a breeze factor; the unit lit up very effectively with a gas match, and burned hot very quickly. Operating instructions are not as good as assembly instructions. We bought the wheel set, which is a very good investment if you expect to ever move this beast."
2,NOT stainless steel,"I've been looking for stainless steel cooling racks and when I found it here I ordered 3. When they arrived, I noticed the surface flaking. Which indicates these are chrome or nickel plated. These are NOT stainless steel as advertised.Update: One of the reviewer states that the term ""stainless steel"" means ""machine washable"". Stainless steel is steel with a percentage of Chromium and another element which makes them resistant to rust. If you've heard the term 18/10 stainless those are the percentage of material that makes them a certain grade of stainless steel. I still have the racks because i can't seem to find stainless steel racks. The search goes on.Update: Looks like Amazon finally got around to taking ""Stainless Steel"" off the title."
5,Best cooling racks I ever bought,"Money wisely spent. I bought two of these substantial, sturdy racks and use them nearly every day to cool cookies, muffins, bread loaves, buns, cakes, waffles, pancakes, etc. The lines are close enough together that cookies don't bend or fall through. These racks also work in the bottom of my large roasting pan, to keep meats off the bottom of the pan. no more scrubbing by hand and no more rusty cooling racks. Buy two, so you have one available while the other is in the dishwasher. You'll love 'em."
5,Tae Bo Ultimate Upperbody,"I love this tape as much as the others. This is a great one for those days when you don't have the time for a strength training routine. It has it all built in, you use your own resistance, but still get a great workout, combine this workout with the others and you will have a great total body workout. I do this tape about 3 times a week, it is a complilation of several great videos. If you are a Tae Bo video collector, you will have to have these. I have every Tae Bo video made, and I love them. This is a must have for anyone new to Tae Bo, you are gonna work but you are also gonna have a great time. And before you know it your gonna look great in no time at all. Enjoy!!!"
1,disappointed,Got this DVD for my mother. It took a really long time to arrive and all the artist listed on the cover were not on the DVD.
4,Vintage Garner & Friends,"James Garner's talent for charming and humorous unpredicability is at it's best in ""Support Your Local Sheriff"", nicely assisted by a cast of good western character actors of long standing. It is a delightful romp.""Support Your Local Gunfighter"" is an often strained attempt to recapture ""Sheriff's"" success and falls short of the mark (as many sequals do). Nonetheless it gives the impression that the actors - at least - had great fun spoofing themselves."
4,Support Your Local Gunfighter/Sherriff,"These are basically the same movie but both are funny and you can't help but love the cool, debonaire James Garner."
2,"dated, dated etc.",the only thing that saves this really dated western is the hilarious performance of the late Jack Elam!
4,James Garner,"James Garner, great actor! These two movies are still favorites of mine. Always intertaining and stand the test of time very well. Two Classic Movies."
3,"Not what I expected, my fault","I did not look close enough at the details for this product. The price was what attracted me for the two movie deal and that resulted in my order. What I found when it arrived, is that it was in 1:33 aspect ration and not 9:16 or 2:35. The quality of the picture was fine, but it does not fill the flat screen as I would have liked. My fault and not the sellers."
5,Support Your Local Gunfighter & Sheriff,Entertaining to the max. Great line up of Stars. Really a delight to watch. Just plain good clean fun with a lot of good laughs.
3,"Good movies,but those DVD's....","I bought the two pack of DVD's featuring both Support Your Local Sheriff and Support Your Local Gunfighter. I love Support Your Local Sheriff and Support Your Local Gunfighter was a decent movie as well(although,I wouldn't want to watch it over and over). My only issue was the DVD quality. Good grief,these movies are terribly dark. I had seen SYLS on VHS and the color was wonderful...but the DVD is so dark,it's hard to see faces and details during most of the film."
2,Buyer Beware,"Though ""Sheriff"" is anamorphic, ""Gunfighter"" is not. In other words, if you have a widescreen TV, the picture will not be scaled to fit your screen; instead you must watch a picture 75% as big as it could be. How a non-anamorphic DVD could be released in 2010, I don't know, but it's something you should be aware of before making the decision to purchase this (mislabeled double-sided) disc. (If you are going to watch this on a 4:3 ""square"" set, you won't have any issues.) Also, the side that is supposed to have one movie has the other and vice versa. A mild annoyance, but very basic error on MGM's part. Boo."
4,Go West,"If your taste in westerns are ""noir-ish"" like Eastwood's ""The Unforgiven"" the 'Suooort Your"" pair should be passed, but for a good time with the family and the popcorn bowl they both are choice."
2,I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REVIEW THIS,"This movie is hilarious. But bad... hilarious.I found myself bust out laughing at some really weird stuff and I'm not sure if it was intended or not.This movie will be a perfect candidate for MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 2020. If you love sitting around with friends and making up anecdotes to go along with the movie and laughing at your own jokes, this is a movie to pick up.I bought it, and I bought it for one reason... CHYLER LEIGH.She won me over in NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE, and I think she has a bright future ahead. She's a fearless actress who has beauty, innocence and a wild side all rolled into one. I really just wanted to own it for the nostalgia of it, and I'm pleased with owning it, but to be fair....THE MOVIE gets 1 star, CHYLER gets 5 stars and it equals to an overall 2 stars... okay, so I'm weird."
5,The best book about a Philadelphia/NBA Sports star ever,"As the author states in the introduction, ""I have tried to write about him [AI] with affection, but secure in my conviction that he'd have little respect for hagiography""This book is an amazing window in to all that is Allen Iverson, a 'genius' a 'basketball prodigy'. It is also a reflection on the complexities of black athelets in America. A must read for fans and 'player haters' alike.WoW"
5,About Allen Iverson,This book is about Allen Iverson and his life and how it was like to grow up where he lived. Iverson lived in NYC where people that he hated would try to start a fight with him. His friends would have to keep an eye on him. Allen Iverson then tried out for a team to keep him out of trouble. Then he started to play basketball and that worked because they weren't able to mess with him. Then Iverson grew up to be a professional basketball player. Iverson then played for the Sixers and became MVP. His life was really hard because his mom would stay on top of him but his mom was nice. Iverson then met a girl and she became his girlfriend and then they had a baby. Iverson just kept playing basketball and his wife was proud of him because he played so well and that's all about Allen Iverson.
4,books,"I don't really remember this purchase, but think I gifted it to a 3rd party, maybe a high school. Amazon service and delivery were good as usual."
4,Good Read for A.I./Basketball fans!,"I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was honest and more detailed than most books about athletes. It did not sugar-coat or villanize the subject. For the most part it just presented situations and let the reader be the judge. There were some things in the book that made you not like AI and there were things that made you really like AI. In the end, I think the book really captured who AI is: A work in progress, an honest guy who plays with enormous passion and lives the same way. What makes him interesting is his unpredictability. His life off the court seems like the one on the court. You never know his next move. Yet you never doubt his confidence and self-awareness. This is a very good book for AI fans and anyone interested in knowing the details of his seemingly tumultuous life."
2,No critical analysis,"My main criticism of this book is that it reads like it was written by a marketer pushing a brand. There is absolutely no criticism of Iverson's behavior - every fault or misstep is spun in a way to glorify AI. This book has enough material to be good, but it fails in the analysis of AI and his character.Don't get me wrong - I am not an AI hater. I think he's an interesting and compelling enough figure to deserve a biography, but that bio should not try to excuse every one of AI's faults. A good biography might have discussed them, and possibly tried to paint a picture of the man Allen Iverson might yet someday still become. This book squarely tries to place blame for every one of Iverson's travails on society and the authority figures surrounding him.The book just refuses to strike a balance that Iverson's troubles are partly caused by the circumstances he grew up with and partly of his own creation. It glorifies every poor choice as a refusal to become ""whitewashed""."
5,an incredible reference volume,"the author has done a great job of defining the times and of digging through the details of the renaissance of road racing in america. if you weren't there, you feel as though you had been once you finish."
4,15-month-old loves it!,"My 15-month old has never watched the Barney show, but he loves this book! After reading it only a couple of times and doing the hand motions with him, he started doing some of them by himself! He loves to look at the pictures of the children doing the motions (pat your head, tap your nose, now bend down and touch your toes...). There's a different motion on each page."
5,Great Interactive Book!,"We have really enjoyed this book at our house! My kids love to imitate what Barney and the children are doing, and we love to do the actions all together over and over. (""Pat your head, tap your nose, now bend down and touch your toes. . ."") It's a really fun way to learn body parts, and it gets us moving and laughing together. Though toddlers and preschoolers will understand the book's contents best, it's also a good choice for babies because they can see Barney and the children very clearly, and babies love bright colors and faces. And after you've read the book and done the actions many times, Baby will most likely start to imitate you, and, behold, a fun tradition is born! This is a great way for you and the kids to interact and have some fun, and the fact that they're learning at the same time sure doesn't hurt!"
1,Laura loses me,"I got a lot of enjoyment out of some previous patrick henden books like dancing fawns and miriam, so i expected to be reasonably pleased by this book, but regretably it was quite a failure. Sometimes he can pull off writing erotica in a mysterious and elusive fashion, but here, its hard to know, which character is speaking, its tiring trying to follow the plot, and there's no pay-off for doing so, because there's very little heartpounding erotica to be had. The titular heroineseems much more aggressive and potty-mouthed than previous Henden female lead's and the sexual theme seems to be ""keep your moon up proud, and do not deny the entry of the pestle.""To that end, most of the sex is either lesbian in nature, or anal, which gets a bit tiring, for fans of regular intercourse."
3,"Fine Performances and Recording, Marred By Programming Gimmick","The music is a perennial favorite, the performances are very lively and committed, and the beautiful recording is spacious, warm and vivid; but Chandos' decision to arrange in chronological order the twelve sections of Bizet's two popular orchestral suites derived from his opera Carmen was a mistake. The whole thing ends in an innocuous, understated and most inappropriate fashion; i.e., it ends on a harrumph and not with a bang as it should.This is one of those recordings for which the CD player's programming function was made -- and going to the trouble of programming is worth the effort! Chandos does supply the original order of the suites' sections in its track listing. However, there are many fine recordings available for which one doesn't have to go through the fuss.The couplings, the equally popular L'Arlesienne Suites, also receive rousing and spirited performances and present no ill-conceived programming gimmicks."
4,Very good for the price,I bought this mouse pad because it is very cheap. It works great with my Microsoft basic optical mouse. The pad is slightly slippery so your mouse will glide more than the average mousepad because the surface of this mousepad is hard. I like this though because my mouse moves faster. The only downfall is that the edges are kind of sharp and I sometimes scratch my arm because I keep my mousepad near the edge of my desk. If you keep your mousepad stationary near the middle of your desk then you will have no problem.
5,beautiful mouse pad,"I wanted to have a smooth pad for the mouse to slide across and in addition to this,I have a wonderful Florida scene to view."
3,Cheap but functional,"This mouse pad is nothing to brag about. It is cheap but it works well enough. If all you want is something to put under your mouse, for the price this is good enough."
1,fake one,"It's so slippery, my laser mouse didn't work at all.do not pay attention to other positive comments, which are all fabricated. trust me."
3,pretty picture,"This pad makes my mouse glide too quickly sometimes. I have adjusted many times however. Overall, fair priced item."
5,mouse pad,"I like very much because it's not in your way,size is just right and makes you comfortable with it, price was great and shipping is free with prime account having it is the best thing you can do if you order a lot. Seller was very specific about it."
3,OK shoe storage bench,"Very fast delivery to my home. The bench is functional as stated. I am Asian so shoes coming off at the door is standard procedure. When assembling, use care handling the pieces since the finish scratches easily and a power screwdriver is mandatory (way too many screws). The top bench piece had misaligned predrilled holes thus my 3 out of 5 stars. Better than having 16 pairs of shoes randomly tossed on the floor."
5,Hip Hop's Houdini's!!!,"Hearing this album makes me wish that Houdini still existed so that he can make this album vanish. The production of this album was done so poorly that they mustve recorded this album in a back of an alley by a gas station. The hook for Tippy Toes was making me tippy toe all the way back to my room (cue rimshot). A guy named Coke singing RnB, that is a joke waiting to happen. As for the guy named Zincere, too bad there is already a guy named Sincere in the rap game....oh yeah, and your off beat too. But as for the total review of the album, pure hotness, this stuff right thurr is about as hot as ice! I see big things coming from this label in the future, polyphony records has some extroadinary artists in their buffet of rappers."
5,well made product,"These stainless bowls are thick, have a nice finish, and are extremely well made. I bought my wife a full set, I liked them so much I purchased another two for my dogs.The entire ""it doesn't hold 8 quarts"" is insignificant to me. I choose a bowl from my cabinet based on its visual size, not what's stamped on the bottom. It's not like they are measuring spoons."
2,"The bowl is not 6.5 quarts, maybe 5!!!!!","The bowl is not 6.5 quarts. And the bottom says 9quarts, too funny. It's nice stainless but they need to change the quart size."
1,6 qt. bowl is closer to 3 qt.,Not a 6 quart bowl. Described as 6 quart. Close to 3 quart. No conversions explain error. Target has 8 qt. stainless bowl (7.5 liters) but closer to 6 1/2 quart. Target has stainless bowl labeled 6 qt. but is the same size as this so called 6 Quart AMCO stainless steel bowl. Got exchange. Same wrong size. Returned for refund. Good customer service. Sad product is so badly mislabeled.
4,"Good Stainless Bowl, but Not Perfect","One of the better mixing bowls for the price, but not perfect.Pros: Good balance between strength and weight.Cons: Small blemish in finish on 1 of 3 bowls ordered. Bowl, esppecially the larger ones had small dents.The discoloration on the finish is fine as long as it does not ""grow"" and the bowls are going to get dented up if used anyway, so not a big deal. My opinion is that they could be a little cheaper for not being a ""perfect, blemish free"" product."
3,A little different from the music videos,Several of the tracks here are a bit different compared to those used in the Mortiis music videos. Parasite God in particular has a different lead-in and some instruments are more in the foreground in the music video.
2,Numbers washed off.....makes measuring rainfall tricky,"I got this rain gauge as a gift and liked that it was easy to read and nice looking. I didn't use the copper leaf part, even though it was pretty, it covers up the first inch at the bottom, which is typically what you would want to read on a rain gauge. My main problem with the gauge is that the first big rainstorm we had - and granted, there may have been some hail - all of the numbers and measuring lines washed off the glass tube. So now I am left with a blank glass tube and I am unsure how to even remark it with a Sharpie because I'm not sure if an inch is really an inch, etc. Would also like to know where to get replacement, as was mentioned by someone else. Kind of a letdown for the price."
2,MUCH SMALLER THAN IT LOOKS,"The Rain Gauge is really very nice looking and well made, but it is so much smaller than I had anticipated. I should have paid more attention to the size when ordering it. It looks dwarfed in my garden spot."
4,A nice slice of CHEAP TRICK!,"Right off the bat, i've been a fan since 1979, i think cheap trick is the greatest working american rock and roll band on the road these days! the guys are awesome! keep up the good work, guys :)as for the DVD, i like it, i wish there were more songs on it, but a lil' CT is better than no CT at all!like others have posted, the running commentary is awesome!funny stuff, indeed! overall, buy the dvd, you'll enjoy it."
3,Could Have Been Alot Better...,"Very disjointed for lack of a better word. The track list is big disappointment and the playing marginal at best. Zander's voice is stronger than ever, Bun E. kicks..., but Rick Nielson's amateurish guitar playing is really brought to light here.Trick did four nights at the Metro playing one of their first four albums in its entirety at each show. Why not show one entire show start to finish in the spirit of the original concept? Long time Cheap Trick fans will love and hate this dvd simultaneuosly. At times they really rock with no equal and at times they sound flat out old & tired."
5,Now I know why I'm a Cheap Trick Fan!!,"Well folks after viewing ""Live in Austrailia"", then ""Silver"" (in that order-oh, and don't forget ""Every Trick in the Book"") Music for Hangovers typifies the true energy of Cheap Trick in a smaller venue. I like the stripped down versions of the songs (sans keyboard), because it didn't abide by the rules of a studio album. Bun E. is one of the most dexterous drummer I have ever seen, almost watching a whole marching band in one person...Robin singing was excellent, Rick's guitar playing was awesome and Tom's bass playing stunned me..he was so note perfect, everything thing he did shaped the song. This reminds me for some reason of a Hard Rock performance I had seen in Miami a few years ago. More intimate, music cutting right through you like a knife, and that connection between audience and band. To be quite honest I could have done without Billy and D'Arcy but I would tell anyone to buy this first before buying Silver. Peace"
2,OK for complete beginner to digital photography,"I was hoping this DVD set would provide siginificant coverage of creative and 'pre-shutter' technical aspects of digital photography. I was expecting significant information on white balance adjustment, lighting options, etc. Instead, it is a primer for thoses with virtually no experience using a digital camera. If you already know how to copy images from your camera onto your computer, open them in any photo editing software and print them out, then I doubt you will find this DVD set very useful.I suppose it could be useful if you are currently intimidated by digital cameras and want to understand the basics of how to take a photo and print it out with your home computer."
2,not the best,"im not learning algebra for the first time, but got the book as a refresher in algebra. I have been out of school for over 15 years and wanted to re learn math. Initially the book starts of well, but then it just seems to cram in material not focus on the steps taken to solve the question. So i think it fall shortin this area. because i umderstood math i havw been able to figure out howmthenanswer came about, but if your new to algebra you may find this book just as fustrating as e class. I think they shoukd have just used less questions and shown more on how they got the answer."
3,Schaum's Elementary Algebra - Incorrect answers,"It was 30 years ago that I used Schaum's series for myself. I find the explanation to be clear and easy to understand. I recently bought the Elementary Algebra (3rd Edition) for my daughter and tonight was the first time I sat down to get her to practice solving a few problems. Out of five problems I randomly picked for her to solve, one had an incorrect answer (5.5L). I thought my math skill had gotten rusty after 30 years, so I tried another similar problem (5.5j). The answer was again obviously incorrect, so I went on the internet to see if others had the same experience. I wasn't the only one and I am disappointed that I had to tell my daughter to follow the explanation, do the problems but ignore the answers."
5,"Beautiful, Haunting & Moody","Being a big fan of everything related to Phil Anselmo (Down, Superjoint Ritual, Christ Inversion, Pantera etc.) it was almost inevitable that I would come across this album; what with his wife being the singer and all. After buying Southern Isolation and listening to the first song all I could say was, ""Wow!!!!"" I then proceeded to listen to the album another 10 times that same day. Opal can not only sing beautifully but can also write awesome lyrics. Come Back And Let Me In (Going Down The Wrong Road) has to be one of the best songs ever written!!!... Even though there is a ""lonely"" vibe running throughout Southern Isolation, there is also something romantic about it as well. This is the perfect album to listen to while laying out under the stars on a summer night with your girlfriend right next to you...just unreal..."
5,"Aunque hay muchos hombres que lo niegan,","NOSOTRAS SOMOS EL MOTOR QUE MOVERÁ AL MUNDO DEL FUTURO... DE UN FUTURO MUY PRÓXIMO, AMIGA !Lee este libro y estarás de acuerdo, CON NOSTRADAMUS Y CONTIGO MISMA !"
1,worst guidebook ever,"I would give this book no stars if possible! This book was NOT what i would call a guidebook. It was a book listing hiking trails with extremely brief descriptions. It doesn't even tell how to get to the trailhead for most of the descriptions! But the author does take the time to go on and on and on about his beliefs and agenda for what the wilderness areas of Colorado should be like. If you are looking for a book that gives plenty of personal opinions, this is maybe the book for you. But if you are looking for a guidebook to co wilderness, don't bother with this piece of trash."
3,Item seems good - not for SC model!,"After Amazon sent me the wrong part, I received the correct part the very next day (kudos to Amazon's customer service).The muffler seems to be of decent quality - the welds between the U-pipe and the muffler canister and the exhaust pipes and canister seem to be -okay-. It's not the most consistent weld, but I suppose you can't expect much more from a $67 dollar muffler.Upon fitting, however, the flange DOES NOT MATCH up with the stock catalytic converter!! I have the supercharged model. There is about a 1/2"" total difference between the flange holes (meaning about 1/4"" for each flange hole if centered).Also, the portion of the muffler pipe that actually engages (fits inside) the catalytic converter is a different diameter than the OEM one.So, unlike what Amazon says, THIS DOES NOT FIT THE SUPERCHARGED MODEL."
5,Very Impressed!,"Needing a new muffler for my antique beloved Toyota MR2, I found this well-regarded OEM by a company still manufacturing in the USA on Amazon at a steal of a price. It fit the car perfectly with no welding required, just bolted on with a power tool and a new gasket at the local Midas shop (they were impressed with my ""bargain"" too). Seller shipped timely. Couldn't ask for more."
4,"A nice book, but holds little advice","This book is nice and interesting, it really can give you inspiration and in me it has awoken an old dream, to travel around the globe. BUT, this book is'n a guid-book and it doesn't give you a lot advice. It's more of a journal, in which the authour tells us about his adventures during a bike trip across the US. What I liked about this book is that the authour, D. Wooten, isn't an athlet and not an experienced bike rider, and it's nice to resd about the challenges and the triumphs of the ""real people""."
3,A must for keeping up maintenance on your Mr. Coffee,All electric coffee machines require cleaning. Most suggest this be done once a week to keep it operating at peak performance. I would suggest getting the large carton of these cleaners to save money in the long run. The process of using this is easy and takes about 20 minutes to finish the entire cleaning procedure.
3,$23? LOL I'm laughing so hard I can barely type,"You can find this on amazon or in just about any store for $6.79, why pay $23 for the exact same item? Because Amazon is jacking up the price on you if you're a prime member, what a rip off."
3,it is ok if you are a porn junkie (fan)...not a thesis,"this is an ok book for those who like to read ANYTHING about the porn stars we so love. i preferred jerry butlers raw talent for more of an ""inside"" personal touch."
2,A FAILED ATTEMPT,"This is a hystorical recapturance of the pornogoraphy industry, that fails to bring its readers;clarity, objectivity and history as well as worthy information. Although this book attemps to uncover the thesis that it presents, it fails drasticly making it the most unclear, piece of work i have read. The reader may be delighted by the evidence that is provided in the book, in order validate the claims being made, it again fails by allowing an overtake of these evidence, abandoning the whole point at hand. In the end this is a poor example of writing, and a unuseful source of information, that can be better obtained and understood by the sources that set out to validate a non existant and unclear thesis and objective."
2,Sensational!!!-NOT!!!,"Fo someone who has never seen, read, watched, anything on the adult industry, this book is sensational. For most people however, it is merely a way for Mr Ford to get rich, by presenting a rather dull narrative of re-hashed garbage about the adult film industry. I suggest potential book buyers visit one of Mr Ford's websites, read the same thing for free and save your money."
5,Possibly the best grief book I have read in 2 years!,"Since losing my daughter 2 years ago, I have read many,many books on the subject of grief. Dr. Smith's book is at the top of the list! He gave me the permission I needed to be angry at God..he let me know that that was okay, and that I was okay. He showed me in such a human way that he too felt as I did when he lost his son, and that the pain of losing a child never goes away, all we can do is hope to learn to live with it. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has lost a child, and also to those close to someone who has suffered this tragedy in their lives."
5,Great Vise with large opening capabilities!,"This Wilton spec'd Chinese made vise is well worth the money. Large screw mechanism. Reversible feature let me have a nice vice for U-joints, etc without breaking the bank. I would definitely buy again. No regrets! Wide jaws, 2 anvil areas, easy operation, easy reversal, great construction. Great Buy!"
3,Good Concept,The concept of this brush is good but it's a little flimsy and tends to bend if you apply too much pressure. It does work well in corners and in between the tines on the grate.
4,Decent,I have to admit that the first game's soundtrack was better than this one. All in all the music from this game was decent. There just wasn't the same haunting quality to the tracks as Shadow Hearts had. I would still advise anyone that enjoyed the first soundtrack to pick this one up.
5,A feminist dystopia,"A book lost to modern readers, the Wall could be compared favourably to the Road, or Oryx and Crake, or early science fiction novels like 1984. It has one lone narrator and protagonist, who lives through an unexplained world changing event, surrounded and ensconced by an impenetrable wall in the company of cats, cows and crows.Middle aged, middle class, and seemingly helpless, survival skills become second nature, and only the smallest of comforts keep her alive and sustained. Yet, throughout there is no sense that this woman is self pitying or paupered. If anything the protagonist seems to grow, and learn not only how to create a livable environment for herself, but one for her companions, keeping them warm, safe and occasionally breeding.The contrast between the facts of dissolution and daily life is stark, but breathtaking in its simplicity.A book to remember for its message, warmth and strength."
4,A necessary guide for NT device code construction,"This is not a book of recipes how to build driver for this kind of driver or that other kind of driver... but all the details about the code construction and the different parts of a NT device driver were very helpful for my work. Though, I'd enjoyed more examples and more topics about the DDK library."
3,Disappointing book.,I was disappointed by this book because it simply assumed you were a robot with Microsoft's DDK at hand. It was missing major information about the actual structure of the various kinds of device drivers and doesn't add much value beyond the chaos that is Microsoft documentation. Thumbs down.
4,great primer for legacy NT drivers,"For neophytes, writing a Windows NT device driver is often an extremely frustrating experience. I first wrestled with the DDK when I was asked to write a device driver for NT (version 3.5). The DDK documentation was wrong in several places. Thankfully, it has improved, but still leaves a lot to be desired.Years later, Art Baker was the first to produce a readable driver development. It was, and still is, an excellent primer for those interested in developing device drivers for the NT operating system.The information is still relevant for those of us who must maintain legacy NT drivers."
5,Excelent book,"Excellent job revising the NT Device Driver book for Windows 2000. My group used the previous version, which had numerous errors and slow reading. I have also read all other books on this subject matter. It is obvious Mr. Lozano understands his audience. The book demonstrates expertise on the author's part. I especially enjoyed building an actual driver as I read through the book. Great presentation!I look forward to more of Mr. Lozano's books."
3,"Good for introduction, but beware!","The book is really useful if you are programming in a ""conventional"" single-processor environment and do not wish to experiment too much. As pointed out by others already, there are some GLARING errors. So if the thing does not work and the book says it should, check the DDK!"
4,Good belt,"It took quite a bit of tightening of the tensioner before the belt stopped squeaking. Once it did, the belt works great. Honestly, I can't tell by usage if it's better than another brand. However, it does look well constructed. The materials look like they will last."
4,"Robben Ford and the Blue Line, In Concert","This is from the Ohne Filter German TV show, and if you're familiar, all their stuff is high quality. Rock-solid band[trio]. Only 4 stars because ""The Paris Concert"" is slightly better."
3,Big Hits Missing,"Don't get me wrong, I really like what I see on this video. But, Come On, How come he didn't play anything from Bridge of Sighs?"
2,Fine For Beginners,"If you're new to both muzzleloading and hunting in general, this book is for you. It would make a fine gift for someone just starting out. However, I didn't find much in this book that would justify its title, nor anything new that an experienced hunter of any stripe could put to use. It's pretty much ""been there, done that"" for the vast majority of hunters. So if you buy it, do so for its low price and fine quality photos that will put you in the mood for next season."
4,Westinghouse Digital frame,I had trouble with frame freezing up on certain pictures. Once I called service dept. and found out it couold only read Jpeg photos it has worked great ever since. I would recomend this product.
1,Freeze-frame display is useless,"No matter how many times I power it off and on again, change the images in the SD card, etc. it still will display a few images and then freeze with a partially updated display. It's useless, and not even a good shape to use as a paperweight. Forget about service from Westinghouse. They don't service products unless they cost millions of dollars."
4,You Get What you Pay For...,"First time reviewer...ok, the frame came as I expected it to with no issues. I did not have any issues setting up the system with pictures that I transferred onto an SD card. It was pretty much plug and play and I love the random mosaic feature the most. The only issue I had with the screen was that it was noticeably brighter on the entire bottom edge of the screen. If you focused on it you could really see it as an issue, it can get annoying if it keeps catching your eye. It seems to me that the main light source of the screen is omitted from the bottom and causes this problem. Otherwise it is a great digital frame for the price ($100 w/ shipping)."
2,I Expected Better,"We bought this frame for ourselves last year for Christmas. We wanted something big enough to see pictures across the room. The reviews for picture quality were good even if it appeared to be somewhat user unfriendly. We got the frame and it is pretty unfriendly but we were able to get it going. We really enjoyed it and the quality of the pictures. HOWEVER, about two weeks ago, the pictures were displayed with a red hue; then, with lines across the whole picture; finally, the frame went totally black. I contacted Westinghouse but the warranty is just for 90 days. They said to reload the pictures and see what it would do. Nothing. You might want to think about the cost versus the length of time the frame lasts when purchasing it."
1,Westinghouse 10.2 LCD Digital Photo Frame,"I'm surprised this item is so defective for the price. I've tried various ways to operate, but it just freezes and won't do anything. I've given up, and am taking back for a refund today. My advice, by another product, don't take a chance on this one. From reading the reviews on this site, looks like Westinghouse needs to recall this item. Too many unsatisfied customers."
4,pretty good large display price - not too user friendly,"I haven't had the problems that many others who've reviewed this product have had. Basically, I just need a large size electronic display for my digital photos. As it is, I found it to be a decent option for the price.I think size wise, it's very nice. I had a 7"" frame which was too small to be seen properly from across the room. At 10"", this one is quite visible. And, close up, the picture is bright and the resolution is good.I do find the fact that the camera displays pictures in an odd order a little annoying. The buttons could definitely have been better designed. But, for just putting a few pictures on a memory card of some type and turning it on and forgetting about it, it's not bad.When you read the other reviews, think about how much control you want. Are you looking for a decent priced, large electronic photo display, or do you need a sophisticated, user friendly media display device?"
2,Great when it works,We bought 4 of these frames for family members. Two of the four had problems with mosiac view freezing up after about 5 minutes. This occurred with both the internal memory and compact flash memory card. When the frame works it's great. We decided to return all 4 frames due to these problems.
2,Loved it when it worked,"I loved this frame but had problems with the slide show freezing after about 5 minutes. I bought this one because I loved the Mosiac view. Tech support wasn't much help. They told me that even though all my files where jpg that if I had done any editing or cropping of them that it would cause this problem. The biggest problem is I had no way of knowing which picture of the 200 hundred or more was causing the problem. Since I edit many of my pictures and don't know which I have and which I haven't edited, I gave up on finding the solution to fix it and returned the frame. When it worked, I loved it."
3,"Puzzles, not lego","An interesting collection of old puzzles. If you are heavy interested in puzzles (block puzzles, wood sliding puzzles and different pentomino/ -omino puzzles), you probably have seen some of these before. If not, you will get a big pack of new ones, collected in one book. (We are talking about 32 puzzles divided in 4 categories).The lego bricks are only used in 2-D (flat on the table), and we are talking about stricktly regular bricks, not any tiles or flat bricks. If you see the puzzle, and have some lego bricks, you probably find it more interesting building the puzzle without looking at the instructions. I guess, even that will in most cases not be a challenge.In general I will say I dont regret I bought this book (because the content was as expected), but the layout is simple, the binding quality is poor, much of the stuff you can allso find other places, and then the price have to be commented as high..."
4,"Dark, melancholic, hopeful","These three words describe the feeling Saviour Machine's music gives: dark, melancholic yet hopeful...The sounds are almost haunting, sad, aggressive at times, but overall they are full of despair! Saddness drips from every song... You can immagine Eric Clayton crying while singing with his huge operatic voice, trying to let the world see the abyss it's falling into!The cd is pretty versatile, though it's not at all like Saviour Machine's latter works... The music is much more rockish and way faster... Eric's voice is not fully developed, though beautiful still... The piano is not as important as it's in their later albums, and their are also less symphonic parts...This is my second fave SaMa album... But then: all of their music is great..."
4,Buy it!,"This is just outstanding. I do not know why this CD does not sell in stores. The music, (Metal) the vocals, the lyrics, the producing the values, the truth coming from this Cd are breathtaking. Everyone who ever wondered about Apocalyptic Mysteries should take a trip with Saviour Machine."
3,Dated; better books out there,"This book is from 1997, which means the photos were taken in the early/mid nineties, and it shows. There are some nice photo's, but you can see that it's quite an old book already: the photo's are definitely not as sharp, nice,... as they are today. Underwater photography has evolved a lot the past two decades.I haven't read the text, so can't comment on that. I'm reselling this book, as for me, it's not a keeper."
1,Bellydancer in Oviedo,"I was very disappointed with this DVD! The instruction was okay, but unlike other instructional DVD's the dance was not choreographed step by step for the student to perform the steps to a dance at the end of the lessons. The last piece of the DVD, just had the instructors performaning the movements. Very disappointing!"
4,Instruction from the best of the best,"Although this was clearly thrown together, the dancers did an excellent job of instuction under the circumstances. These women are the best of the best. This was not intended to be a workout or performance video but rather an intro to BD movements and isolations and that is exactly what it provides, nothing more. I have many, many BD videos. Each of them provide something but none of them provide everything. That's what you take a class for. I would recommend it and have purchased one for myself and one as a gift."
5,Great Video,"We really enjoyed the videos in this set. As I own property on the Kenai pennisula, I am constantly striving to learn more about Alaska, and living in all parts of Alaska. This is well worth the time and money!"
5,Dick Proenneke,this man lived alone in the Alaskan wilderness for 30 years! All the videos on his life (Bob Swerer productions)are really great ....
2,Eco Alaska,"These four DVDs cover Bears and living in Alaska and how the oil companies are destroying Alaska, and it was not what I expected. But you might enjoy them, it depends on what you are looking for."
5,Thorlo Women's Mini Crew - cool & comfortable,"I've tried other brands of hiking socks, but they seem to wear-out so quickly. These Thorlo's have lasted well beyond hiking in the Canadian Rockies and many, many washings. Well worth the price to have comfortable, long lasting hiking socks!"
2,Size runs small,"Not real happy with these. I ordered the largest size and they are still smaller than marked and, of course, shrink in the wash. Keep looking."
5,nice quality,I machine wash/dry these and they have held up great. Well worth the money. They are a nice height and weight for hiking socks. I ordered two more pair. The sizing is accurate as well.
5,"Perfectly snug, lots of cushion, incredibly comfortable","I wear these socks with my boots and rain boots because they never slip, never slide, and always give me the perfect amount of cushion and warmth without ever becoming too hot. They're also never itchy. Very nice socks; I have six pair."
1,Waste of time and paper,"I'll make it short - this book is SO stupid and booooring. Looking for HiTech thrillers read ""Mount Dragon"" by Lincoln/Preston or ""Society of the mind"" by Eric L. Harry instead."
1,"fasle advertisement, misrepresentationNOT KILLER PRIEST","this case displays the movie killer priest and has pictures from the movie and the short uninformed summary of the original killer priest..but when i popped in the disc labeled ""killer priest""...i saw a totally different film from the old classic i know and love!!!!! there was NO evil conman/sorceror, NO iron palm!! and of course NO levitating ""killer priest"".check out the REAL killer priest on vhs. its under wu tang collection, but its not part of their shoddy dvd series!!!!!!its a hard to find tape, most likely to be able to find on ebay, or websites for genre flix.i contacted XENON and GOT MY MONEY BACK!!!!!"
1,Off focus,"Unlike a previous review, there are stories in here that don't deal with Gettysburg at all. This is a ""Top 40"" women of the CW, not Gettysburg. And some of these women contributed nothing worth reading, let alone writing about. Poorly written."
3,Why only half of the Cronkite dinosaur video series?,"This set is peculiar. It contains several videos from National Geographics about dinosaurs. These are somewhat old but otherwise OK. What is really odd is the packaging of only TWO of the four dinosaur documentaries made for A&E; back in the early 1990's that were presented and narrated by Walter Cronkite. The original series had four episodes, but this set merely contains two of them (A Tale of a Bone and A Tale of an Egg). What is missing are A Tale of a Tooth and A Tale of a Feather. Why? Are they planning the release of another set with these other two parts on it? Again, some of this stuff is dated, but it still comes off rather well consdering their age.The set has no menus or any frills what so ever and play much like the DVD-R stuff sold by the History Channel from their website. Again, why?Because of the two missing episodes as well as the ""no-frills"" presentation on the DVD, I gave it 3 stars out of five."
5,An Excelent Read,"""Evil"", in the strict sense of the word, might best have been left out of the title of this book. Baumeister does an excellent job of explaining the inner workings of the human psyche as it pertains to cruelty and violence. These actions are deeply or thinly veiled in all humans and held in check by the strength of ones self control and/or morality. A small step at a time could lead any human to acts of cruelty or violence, scarcely noticing the descending path one has taken. I wouldn't say that this book is light reading and it is sometimes disturbing, but it is well worth the effort for anyone who seeks insight into the darker sides of humanity. Beware, you might recognise some small part of yourself within these pages.I am a subscriber of Scientific American and was referred to this book by their recommendation."
4,Very good information,I have found this book to be very insightful on the topic it covers. It uses real life examples which can be very sad but it also proves the point it is trying to make.
3,Danger: product is brittle!,"From personal experience -- think carefully before mounting this to anything that might hit against an obstacle! For example, if is on a wheelchair and gets caught in a heavy door, the thin, hollowed-out construction makes it likely to break badly. The peices are useless, somewhat sharp, and probably impossible to repair."
1,Spilled the coffee,I live in Seattle so a cup of coffee is part of the uniform. This sounded good but that's all. Never quite got the coffee to sit upright. It had a tendency to flip over. Finally the holder got stuck in the wheel of the chair and OOPS. All gone.
3,"Wheelchair - yes, walkers - no","""Ableware Wheelchair Cup Holder - 706220001On a walker, the cup holder is too flimsy. I wouldn't put anything made of glass or pottery in it. It will hold a 20 oz. plastic bottle, but I always put tops back on.It's EASY to uninstall for cleaning. However, if the main clamp is too big for the tube, you're in for a bit of work. According to the product specs, the clamp will fit a 1""+ tube and has a sleeve for 7/8"" frames. Either my tape measure is wrong or I'm very tired, but my walker has a 1""+ frame. To keep the holder in place, I'm using the clamp, the sleeve and a few rounds of electrical tape to hold it. And I can easily wiggle the cup holder around.The seller's website (AllegroMedical) says: ""The Ableware Wheelchair Cup Holder can also be attached to any round tubular device such as walkers or bed rails."" True, but no guarantee it will work well. If you want a walker cup holder, buy one for a walker..."
5,Excellent Product,"Loved this product! Held cups, mugs, etc. - wonderful product - Definitely would recommend."
2,flimsy,Can't be clamped on to the wheelchair to hold beverage securely. Tried in multiple places - forget holding anything more than 3 oz.
2,Too Small,Am really glad to find a cup holder that will fit on my music stand. Am REALLY disapointed in the size of vessel the holder will accomodate. Why even have slots in the side for the finger ring of a coffee mug if the standard coffee mug doesn't fit?
3,Cup Holder,"This plastic cup holder broke when I used it on my walker and someone wasn't careful when they laid my walker in the back seat area of my minivan. I did like it, but found another one that isn't so apt to break."
2,Not a great design,"1st it took me a bit to get it on my chair, but that could just be my lack of skill in that area. Then, within a week of getting it I found that it didn't make much sense for going through doors, when I broke it. If you think about it, a wheelchair has just enough room to fit through a typical door. If you put a cup holder where mine had to go, its not gonna work, & I was not prepared to take the thing off & on as needed! I am on the lookout for one with a better/easier design."
2,Broke within a few weeks,"I wasn't there when it broke, but on the wheelchair it sticks out several inches on the side. Somebody rammed it into a door frame and broke it without really trying. It was not too hard to install, but I knew that it would only be a matter of time until that happened, and it did. I was disappointed that it broke so quickly, but am not sure what would have been better. Perhaps a rubber type holder instead of the flimsy, but stiff, blue plastic."
4,Good product,This product works very well. It only works on cans and small diameter cups though. We bought it to clamp on to our gazebo swing. Only draw back with this application is that it collects water from condensation or rain in the bottom of the cup holder.
1,no star rating only the system made me give it one.,BAD! Just plain BAD.It's a zombie movie you expect bad acting but this was bad and made worse by the editing. The editing was so choppy it made me nauseous. The sound wasn't any better than the editing. Nothing about this movie (?) was coherent.
5,Stainless Baggage Door Latch,"Much more studier than the cheap plastic ones that came on the RV. The Texas sun cooked those to powder in about 2 years so I think these will last much longer. Easy to install, just had to make a new hole for one screw."
2,Not very good...,"I wasn't sure between this or another more expensive trimmer. As excepted for $10, this one is not so good. The design is poor and it's REALLY loud !"
1,Cheaply Made,"Following instructions,I first attempted to remove the plastic shield covering the blades. When I did, the blade head separated from the body of the device. Impossible to reattach.A waste of money."
1,Buyer be ware,Bought the first one and in less than a few months it broke ... bought the second one and the same part broke around the same time ... cheap is cheap I guess ... buy some thing that lasts and do not waste your money or time on this product ... I will never buy another Vidal Sassoon product again.
5,The Hawk Soars High,"Lessons From the Hawk offers its' readers an interesting perspective on classroom management. It provides the reader with the tools needed to implement the ""Micro"" system of classroom management. Kennedy divides learning into four different types and offers a method of identifying those types in your classroom. The instructor can then use the micro system.I liked this book because it was an easy read. I also liked it because the ideas seemed tangable. I feel that I could use this method in my classroom and have success with it. I had the opportunity to observe micro in action and was instantly made a believer. Micro works, and this book will show you why and how."
2,Not new,"This book is a reprint. The Star Publications book, with a date of 2001, is a reprint of a book written in the late 1800's. In fact, there are few texts out there that are modern. The Hippocrene ""Modern Pushtu Instructor"" is also a reprint of an older text. While this may not bother some people, others might find the older texts' methodology a bit pedantic or the langauge may be outdated."
4,well worth watching,"a brillant movie.also a very well executed murder done by a ameture fuelled by a step by step guid to kill in cold blood.with info on everything to wear,plus info on weapons to use.he grabs his book and goes out to comit cold blood murder in execution style. a well done true story that is well acted out.plus if u like court room battles this one is for you!"
4,Really good fun,"I bought the English language version that already released in Europe and it's a great game. Some of the best graphics I've seen on GBC and the gameplay is fun and challenging. The box graphics suggest that this is a product for younger gamers and it can be, but I'm an experienced gamer and I like it also.You get alot of entertainment for a small price. I hope they release more games based on that little purple Rhino character."
2,"GN Pro Performance 3/4 Sleeve Shirt, XLarge, Green Trim","While the shirt is fine, I did not notice the XL, thus it is much too large for me. Had to give it away. I wear a size Large"
3,Great product but is it useful?,"Amco makes great stainless steel products but do you really want to use stainless steel tools for serving/mixing/tossing salad? Stainless steel leaves spots when wet tools are not dried and knowing how everyone upkeeps their products, you're sure to have black spots.So to conclude, good tools but it'd be better or more practical if you get a wooden salad serving set."
2,Watch out for back cover!,"I ordered this book as a gift and found it completely unsuitable because of the photo on the backcover. The gift was intended for a father of 2 small children; he certainly would not want a book with a cover photo of a man with a vulgar word written on his forehead and making a vulgar gesture. Neither one of us is a prude, but this is something you don't want around children. I only wish that Amazon could let customers know what the back cover looks like in cases like this. I wasted money and time! I'm sure the inside content would have been interesting, but a coffee table book's cover--back AND front--need to be suitable for public consumption."
1,The worst of all movies,"I have never seen anything like that. The most lame, the lowest of all cinematographic works! The acting below any standard! Script? is there any script there??? Language... the most atrocious of all Polish speaking! Comedy??? Do they know what comedy is all about??? I couldn't watch the whole thing. I think it would take a bottle of vodka to be consumed before watching that atrocity!!! Not worth a cent to pay for. It looks like Polish cinematography is dead!!!"
1,The Book Sucks!,This book is not worth the energy that I expended to carry it to class each week. I agree with everything that the other reviewer said. I had to purchase 2 extra books to help me learn statistics. I simply don't recommend this book to anyone.
1,Let the confusion begin....,"This is just about the most confusing statistics book ever written. Even my professor does not like the book but has no choice in the text for class. If math is not your strongpoint, I suggest getting ""Statistics for People Who (Think They) Hate Statistics"" by Neil Salkind (recommended by my professor)and ""Schaum's Outline of Statistics"" by Murray Spiegel as supplemental reading. I would burn this book if it wasn't so expensive!"
3,easy to use,just so so. It doesn't work and I cannot get the manufacter to respond to the problem. I have since bought one from the drugstore it works fine
3,Review for blood pressure cuff,"After using a different brand cuff for almost ten years, it died. So I read a number of reviews and decided to purchase the North America Healthcare TV3649 Wristech Blood Pressure Monitor. Basically it reads accurately which is important. The reason I did not give it a better rating is that it is soooooo slow. It takes, what seems like forever, to get a reading. Other than that, I would recommend this unit. It appears to be well made and has a large print on the screen."
2,slow cuff,"This is not the best of portable cuff,i bought two in the last 3 months for coworkers and they take forever to give you result...both of them"
1,Not accurate,"I received this item as a gift and I never could get a normal reading. Knowing my ""normal"" this monitor flucutated 40-50 points over a few minutes time. I could not (nor could others) get a consistent reading. It is either inaccurate or just a piece of unreliable junk."
4,REV-MUNOZ,"Wristech Blood Pressure Monitor As Seen on Tv Wristech New and Improved Model. FDA ApprovedTHE MONITOR SEEMS TO BE EASY TO USE,HOWEVER TO GET AN ACCURATE PRESSURE READING THE ARM'S POSITION IN RELATION TO THE HEARTH POSITION HAS TO BE VERY PRECISE WHICH IS NOT EASY TO ACOMPLISH. ANYWAYS, ONCE YOU GET AND CAN REPEAT THAT POSITION THE READING IS CONFIABLE."
2,Pressures fluctuate a lot,Pressures fluctuate a lot and usually are lower than what my doctor measures. It's not reliable... specially for the diastolic pressure that shifts a lot in between 2 sequential readings.
1,Geez,Wholly inaccurate. Would give drastically wrong readings frequently enough to be completely useless. This purchase was a waste of money and time.
5,WrisTech is accurate and handy product,I used WrisTech 15 minutes before I went to my doctor's office. My doctor got the same numbers as WrisTech. I use it all the time. I use it before and after meal that way I know what food raises my blood pressure.
3,Its Okay!,"I am a nurse, and a speedy, light weight BP machine is always the way to go. This product works fine if you use it correctly.. It must be LEFT wrist with the persons hand at the level of the heart rate, If it is'nt the machine would read either Hypo or hyper -tensive..which can create problems. But Other than that.. it works fine... Hope this helps."
4,"Works great, but keep an eye on readings","I have to say, I love this. I am a CNA, and I use this daily on residents. You do have to keep an eye on readings, but overall, I have zero complaints for the price. It does give kind of whacked out results sometimes... normally on pt's who are moving around too much, or are normally hard to get readings on. Good buy :)"
1,Not accurate!,This Wristech is not accurate at all. You can take a reading three times in a row and get very different results each time. I wouldn't depend on it for monitoring a serious condition such as hypertension. Too risky!
4,Blood Pressure Monitor,This is a very good low cost monitor - easy to use and has a memory feature. Be sure to follow directions to get accurate readings - such as your arm should be on a table about level with your heart.
2,Wris Tech Blood Pressure Monitor,It doesn't work and I cannot get the manufacter to respond to the problem. I have since bought one from the drugstore it works fine
1,not at all accurate,"One minute it told me my blood pressure was so low I should probably be dead and the next, I had high blood pressure. Not sure how this product could possibly be useful, so I had to return it."
1,Toy medical equipment,"This product was not worth the money. I could have purchased a better piece of medical equipment in a toy store. It was very light weight and did not give accurate readings, when it gave a reading. I tried to use this several times but was embarrassed because it either misread the BP or it read an outrageous pressure sure as 150/150. I eventually got frustrated with the device and returned it."
1,BP Toy,"I bought this thinking it would be a good tool to take quick measurements. This device is completely inaccurate. It is not worth the free shipping let alone the purchase price. If you are really hypertensive or suffer from some sort of cardiac myopathy, I would suggest steering clear of this. I didn't realize this was an ""as seen on TV"" product. Epic Fail!Update: I have found wristcuffs useful in my line of work as a screening tool. This particular one is trash. I would advise sticking to name brands. Any positive reviews on this product are fake."
1,Not reliable,"Of what use is a blood pressure instrument that gives you very different readings from one minute to the next? I can absolutely assure you that if your blood pressure reads 132 at 12:00 and 112 at 12:02, that it isn't because your actual BP has dropped that much. Bottom line, you can't tell what your real BP is with this product."
1,Do not waste your money on this product,"I am really shocked and disappointed! How such products are allowed to be available!The fancy look of this product hides a horrible results! It is not accurate at all, this product for sure will miss lead you! Then you will be afraid about your life!I strongly recommend Amazon to remove it from the site and other customers stop buying it."
3,Does What It's Supposed To,"This product starts out on a bad note when you open the box. No batteries. The first thing you have to do is find/buy some 'AAA' batteries. Not a good look.I don't really know how accurate it works. It seems to be accurate enough for home use. If it says your BP is very high I would make a trip to the doctor's office.The device is decently made. Not high quality. Decent. A lot of plastic.The real question is ""Is it worth the money?""I got this on sale for $15.00. The regular price is $40.00. If I had paid $40 I would have a lot more complaints. For $15.00? I feel I got a decent deal."
1,"Well made, but not accurate at all","Depending on how and where I hold my wrist, it goes from either 100/60 all the way up to 170/100. My normal blood pressure is usually 125-130/80-85. The pulse count is right, but the blood pressure is way off. Due to this variance, I cannot recommend this unit to anyone for any reason. Get a cuff unit instead."
2,Not as good as the reviews,"Bought this product because I want to check my BP at work and the overall reviews were good, but it just doesn't deliver. It looks nice, has a good case, and is easy to use but not accurate. Readings are all over the place. My wife is a Registered Nurse and we compared the readings to her checking my BP & HR manually as well as with another machine she uses at work, overall the WrisTech failed on accuracy. Would not recommend if your seeking accuracy. Rated 2 stars because we don't use the word HATE more like disappointed."
3,NA Healthcare TV3649 WristBP Monitor - it's ok...,"my blood pressure has been erratic, so my Dr suggested I get a BP wrist cuff. There are so many to choose from, so I just ordered one. I've been having a visiting nurse for another issue, but she and I have compared my BP with her manual arm wrap vs my wrist cuff. This morning immediately following her reading I used the wrist cuff. The systolic was 17 points higher than her reading and the diastolic was 13 points higher. That's a big difference. I have been writing down which method has been used and made a list for my Dr to interpret, even given the difference in readings. I gave it a rating of 3 because I guess it's better than not being able to measure my BP at all, so I'm grateful to have it."
2,Good while it lasts,"This blood pressure device seemed pretty accurate while it was working, but after a week it stopped working. Since I need to take blood pressure readings every day, this monitor has not been a good purchase. I guess you need to put more money into these things because an inexpensive monitor only goes so far. I would not buy this again; I would have been better off investing in a more expensive monitor."
1,Crappy old products,"Used my blood pressure monitor one time, now will no longer turn on and battery cover just falls off. I have used brand new batteries, the thing just stopped working."
2,wristech blood pressure monitor,It is not accurate. I have compared with the pressure monitors aat the hospital and it is off by 20 or more. It will vary from 116 to 180 when taken one right after the other
1,looks good but inaccurate,"This looks really great - easy to use, handy. However, I tested it 3 times against my doctor's BP cuff, and it was about 20 points off (not always the same amount off). My doctor said he usually found the wrist bp monitors to be inaccurate. I also compared it with another bp monitor, and finally gave up on it. I would have returned it, but by the time I had the chance to compare it, it was too late to return it. Not sure if they're all like this, or I just got a lemon - but I don't use it. I just got a better one."
2,variable readings !,"I am aware that blood pressure readings do vary , but this monitor gives widely varying readings one after the other.For example :- 165 / 86 , 150 / 83 , 137 / 80 , ! The monitor does not seem at all accurate or reliable."
2,battery door problem,"I have had it too long to return, but I am having trouble. I finally figured out that I need to press on the batter door to get it to come on. You must use it exactly as directed to get consistent readings, but that would be with any, I guess. Great price if you don't get a defective one like mine. It is a snap to use."
1,Dosent Work Don't waste Your Money,Brought this product on amazon 2 of them to be accurate. The first shipment did not work sent it back and asked for replacement of same product gave product benefit of doubt. Second shipment arrived same problem did not work. Amazon just throw this product away it seems that none of them work.
2,Doesn't work correctly.,"I don't have time to write more for this product which just doesn't give the right answer, and that too different values each time you test it. I thought of taking it for the price, but we should all remember that good product always costs more. Just want to warn other users not to waste their money on this. I bought it for my father, and couldn't even return it in 30 days - money wasted."
1,sifarber1@gmail.com,sifarber1@gmail.comUnfortunately we have a very poor review.We have struggled with this product since we rec'd it.It is very inconsistent never giving the same reading and leaving uswith not knowing where we stand.We have always been very satisfied with Amazon items but would like to return this item because it serves no purpose for usPlease adviseThanx Si Farber
1,Terrible Product,"I purchased this product in order to check my blood pressure. I took it to my doctor's office to make sure their blood pressure machine was calibrated the same as this one. It was so far off that my doctor suggested that I throw it in the trash. If you want to accurately test your blood pressure, don't by this product. It's worthless."
1,Inconsistent readings,"I borrowed this from a friend after being diagnosed with high blood pressure. The readings are consistently inconsistent and ranged from normal to high. Thankfully, I got to try this out before I purchased, because it would have been a waste of money. When monitoring BP, you need to know where things are at, not that just that you have a blood pressure!"
3,Value for money,"Pretty good gadget for the price it offers. Bit tricky to get the exact reading but once you know how to handle this, it can be quite precise."
4,nice item,good accuracy.very easy to use. fast deliverery I would recommend seller.A very good gift idea for christmas.Has great potential to possibly save lives
5,Does the Job,"Easy to use. Seems like it could be a little small for someone with a large wrist, but fits perfect for me."
1,Ouch,This stuff burned my skin. I am a 50+ African American female and had never used Avon products on my face and was surprised when it started tingling then burning. It's been 6 months and the discolorations are still very visible. This may not be for everyone.
4,"Product is nice, the jar is not.","This product definitely did what it is supposed to (lighten the spotting and melasma that come with time spent outside). My issue with it is that the jar is impractical to use for a face cream; even with a q-tip, it is hard to get the product that that stays up at the top of the jar under the ""shoulders"". It is a cream and the fragrance was lovely, smelled faintly of cucumber or melon, I think, and lightened my overall tone (Caucasian, but with a touch of olive) such that my husband said my face was too pale. I have oily skin, and maybe this was a bit too rich for me, but the results were nice."
4,imo,"Not perfect, but very near & it is probably the best available if you don't want your napkins, ahem, loose. I am definitely not looking anymore after ordering 3 & giving away 2."
3,Overpriced - Would rate higher if it was 15 dollars or less,I bought this item well over 2 years ago and it still looks nice but it takes up more counter space than the traditional holder I had. This is not problem for larger kitchens. Still appreciate the modern look though. (Napkins can look messy if smaller than square).
5,"Looks Great, Works Great.. Enough said","If you are looking for a simple napkin holder (yes that pun is on purpose), look no futher. It works as great."
4,Good napkin holder,It holds a lot of napkins and they are easy to get out without all of them coming out. Would recommend.
2,Does it work? Depends on the napkins,"While the product should work in theory, it all depends on the type of napkins used, and the amount. If it is full of napkins, it works most of the time. When it gets down to about 20 napkins, they all start to come out. Especially the cheap napkins you buy for picnics for about a buck. It's not worth $24."
3,"Unnecessarily bulky, but works","I most totally agree with another reviewer who stated that this product is way too bulky--unnecessarily so. I live in Brazil, where napkin sizes are usually smaller, which makes the oversize aspect much more of an issue. However, on the good side, it works quite well and looks clean and sturdy. Best to all! Cláudio"
1,Same video as TAEBO II advanced - Just new name,I was very unhappy when I put this video on thinking I was getting an ultimate lower body workout to find it was the same video I have already just a new package and different name - Now I have to pay to ship it back - Costing me more money because I already have the video! Maybe next time they will creata NEW video rather than repackaging it!
1,Is it Wise?,"Being new to the study of the Craft, I certainly don't know as much as someone who's been a practicing Wiccan, but I do remember reading in more than one book on the subject that the use of magick in order to make someone like you better is not such a smart idea. Theoretically, the energy you send out in spell casting returns to you, and if that's true, then there is probably, a chance you could get more than you bargained for if you use magick in order to attain power."
1,"It can't hurt you, can it?","The energy you put out returns to you. While none of the stupid charms herein will do anything, except maybe make you feel silly, purchasing this book tells the publisher that works like this are needed.Put it down, and pick up something that will teach you."
1,12th Van Cliburn Piano Competition,I believe buyers of this particular DVD have been rip off big time! This is one lousy compilation of the event. There were no complete performances of the gold and silver winners unlike the 11th competition. I'd give this rating a 0 star if this is available on your chart.
5,FIVE STARS ARE NOT ENOUGH! THIS DESERVES 500 STARS,"I've seen all the Van Cliburn Competition videos and DVDs and have found them all to be great. But this one soars to the heights of musical and visual beauty. It inspires, it thrills, it exceeds expectations in every respect. Give yourself the pleasure of owning it. You'll never regret it."
3,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY!,"This book is NOT a complete anthology of scores.A more correct title would be ""Selected Full Scores"".The content is as follows:Dance of EternityHomeErotomaniaJust Let Me BreathePeruvian SkiesPull Me UnderUnder A Glass MoonVoicesI feel that this information should have been given by Amazon.com, because I was VERY disappointed when I found out that is was NOT a complete anthology, and the low rating should be seen in this perspective.However if you buy it fully aware of the content, throw 2 more stars in, 'cause the transcriptions are top-notch, and the book is nicely wrapped."
3,Uneven... very uneven,"First of all, this book is done by several different transcribers and the difference in quality between the different contribution is enormous. Those done by progressivetranscriptions.com are amazingly well done, testament to the dedication and professionality of these guys. There is hardly a mistake to be found.However, all the other tracks are another deal. The guitar transcriptions in them are from the official guitar books for their respective albums, which means their quality is good (John Petrucci reviewed these). The keyboard, bass and drums on the other hand seem to have been done by a person without experience or talent, or even both. They are embarassingly poor, and as a transcriber myself, I found it hard to read through the scores with these glaring mistakes present. Buy it for Dance of Eternity, Peruvian Skies, Just Let Me Breathe and Home if nothing else."
3,Very disappointing,"Besides not having Learning to Live I have found numerous errors in this book. The drum interlude part in Under the Glass Moon is EMBARRASSINGLY wrong. And for something that was supposedly reviewed by the band, it's very disappointing. It's a good book, but there's lots of improvements to be made. Also I have more recently found that Erotomania is improperly done towards the end as well!"
4,A fantastic collection of music!!,"This anthology is a really incredible compilation of some of Dream Theater's classic songs. The transcriptions are pretty much much dead on and everything is arranged very well. It's nice to finally have some keyboard music to these songs, especially for Dance of Eternity. My only complaint is that ""Learning to Live"" is not included in this book even though it has been stated otherwise. That disappointment aside, this is an excellent buy and is a very useful book for those who are interested in every musical aspect of the songs within the collection."
3,Why be misleading?,"I only bought this book for ""Learning to live"" that was listed in the description of its contents. Unfortunately this song has never been part of the book! I discovered that absence after buying it. Despite the book's interesting content I am disappointed from this purchase (I would have rated the book with 5 stars, but 2 stars were removed because of the misleading description)."
3,good book... good information... but not real advanced,"Lots of basic info in this book, but no advanced topics that you will be faced with in SAP optimization. Would love to see something more advanced from SAPPress"
3,Different,"While incredibly different than even his previous solo effort and much more different than anything done with Phish, it is still a solid record if you can block the amazingness of his previous efforts haha. For real hardcore Phish fans like myself, I don't know how you will recieve it, that is surely based on personal feelings. However, if you are new to Phish/Trey, than you will love it, very easy on the ears, not very much intelligence or appreciation needs to be put into this album. It's fun to listen to every once in awhile but definitely won't have the staying power of say a Junta or Lawn Boy. Sadly it's Trey's life and if he wants to make pop records now, it's his life, let him make the wrong decision haha."
3,Very good album from Trey,"I've been a Phish fan for more than a decade, and have seen them 30+ times. Yes, I miss Phish....but, I'm really pleased with Trey's latest effort. He is focused again. Even Phish fans can admit that the last two Phish albums were poor. Shine shows promise. In three years time Shine will be a memory, it will have made it's mark much more so than Undermind or Round Room.Listen to it for what it is, not what you think it should be."
4,"Trey Makes a Great Studio Album, a Springboard for Better Live Versions","I think a lot of people I know that have followed Trey since the 80's in Phish still want the Phish sound from him. Some of that sound is present here, but I think you need to give him the chance to keep finding his own sound that he started with his first self titled release.This album is less Latin sounding than his first solo release. The first single, Shine, is a great microcosm of this album as a whole. Trey set out to make concise solid rock songs. This may not be his best environment. We all know how he is a guitar God live. But his talents are more restrained in a record studio. Knowing this, Trey focused on songwriting and making tight focused songs.Give Trey a chance to make a solid studio rock album and you might really enjoy this album."
2,"I like the Honeynet Project idea, not so much the book","I bought this book based on the recommendations of other readers. The first 3 chapters which describe the Honeynet configuration are of some value. The book however turns into an extremely repetitive exercise, and there are at least one hundred pages dedicated to a news dialog between teenager hackers."
4,Good book but missing some info.,"I found this book to be very informative but felt the authors were holding back. I know The Honeynet Project has much more up their sleeves. Tool coverage is great, motives too, but missing ""meat"" of tactics. Still a very good read and recommended to learn more about BHats."
2,Disappointing. Way too much padding.,"Having seen Lance Spitzner's website and read other reviews of this book, I have to say that it failed to live up to my expectations. There is far too much repetition. It felt like Spitzner was still in the army, lecturing a class of new recruits and drumming everything in over and over. Maybe OK in a classroom, but not a book.The transcripts of script-kiddy IRC sessions constitute the biggest single section of the book, but have little real value, and very few words per page. The whole things has the feel of something that seemed like a good idea for a book, but when they got down to it they found there wasn't enough to put in, so they just bulked it out.There are useful and interesting things in there, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one."
2,"derived from ""livingroom- IT""","I read through the book, and it was O.K.. The Book is excellent if you are not looking for up to date knowledge about security and IP.I could not make use of any of the facts / chapters in industrial security environments, because every insight is derived from very simple setups which are not refelcting today's complexity of IP, Network Infrastructure and Security. As the author mentions within the first 10 pages::: the knowledge is derived from his living room. Sure it is no mirror of today's networks.However for people running small homeoffices it might be a good source."
5,I love this bag!,"I purchased this bag for my husband as a ""daddy diaper bag"" I like it so well that I use it frequently myself. It really holds a ton of stuff. The only thing I did not love about it was that it's changing pad is thin, I like the thicker one that came with my fleurville bag. My baby likes the thicker one too. Otherwise this is just a great bag overall."
2,Very disappointing,The true-life story of Rebecca Galloway and Tecumseh is gripping. This book did not do it justice. Rinaldi's version was incredibly confusing to me because the author kept mixing up the village of Old Chillicothe in western Ohio (where the Galloways really lived) with the much larger town of Chillicothe in eastern Ohio. Sheesh.
1,"Awful, Terrible, And Any Other Adjectives For BAD.",This book was horrifically terrible. We had to read it as an eighth grade class and everyone hated it no exceptions. Even the teachers who had read it said it was atrocious. Don't be fooled by others reviews this book didn't even deserve one star.
1,This book is Torture!,Who wants to read a book with 278 pages if only the last 78 pages have excitement in them and leave you hanging after the last page? I believe that any author who has been through some kind of education could write a book that is exciting while still trying to get across the message that the author wants. EIGHTH GRADERS Be alert before your teachers try to pull this book on you it may be the worst book you have ever read in your life!
3,Tecumseh,"A semi fictional story which begins in the summer of 1798, about a real girl by the name of Rebecca Galloway, whose parents had recently uprooted themselves from Kentucky to the Ohio Territory because they were against slavery. Rebecca's family has settled on land that had once been the childhood home of the Shawnee Chief Tecumseh. With her father's consent, Tecumseh periodically visits, and befriends 6 year old Rebecca who becomes his teacher. Over the next 10 years their friendship evolves until she is forced to make a choice. The book references many historical events between 1792 and 1813, that her family is either involved in or that 'everyone is talking about' such as the duel between Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr."
5,Wonderful writing -- wonderful reading,A beautifully told book. Ann Rinaldi does a superb job with interesting and well developed characters. I'd like to see more historical fiction of this calibre.
3,A disturbing thought,"Although I liked The Second Bend in the River, there was something that disturbed me. The age diffrence between the girl and the cheif. There was such a huge age diffrence. I calculated it once and don't remember what it was. The chief was old enough to be her father, by far. I have consulted my friend on this book who loves Rinaldi and she was also disturbed with the fact. Although it was disturbing I liked the book, although I don't often speek badly of a book. I hope if you read it that you might enjoy it."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,You've got to be kidding me! This DVD has to be the ultimate ...!!!If this isn't authorized by KISS then they should sue sue sue.....if it was advertised as a 4 song EP DVD....then I might not have a problem but it makes you think its a full-length concert!.The directors cut flashes through every camera angle so quickly it will make your head spin and is guaranteed to give you a headache! You have to watch the split screen version to get any kind of satisfaction out of this...
1,Terribly Disappointed,"I saw this in the store and stupidly purchased before looking up the reviews. I figured, if it's a *Concert* and it's 100 minutes it's going to be worth the money.Unfortunately, the *concert* was only 4 songs. To me that's a performance but not a concert. After watching 4 songs it changed to the multi-cam view and I thought my DVD was defective. That's when I realized the sickening truth.Now for the money I paid, I would likely have purchased it even if I knew it was only 4 songs. The difference is then I would have bought it expecting just 4 songs, but I would not have purchased that day. I now feel I was tricked into purchasing that day.I understand that Kiss was not behind this release and would have complained to pixelon.com if their website still existed.Kiss needs to put at least one full length concert DVD to stop their fans from buying shoddy material. At least next time I'll know to see if it's an authorized release and to read the reviews first.Kissed off,Jer"
2,"KISS, Don't Let Me Down Next Time!!","I have been kiss fan for 16 years. I want to say is this DVD really let me down! It's only 4 songs. The bonus are not surprising either. This DVD is not authorized by KISS. We hope the real full length make-up concerts DVD will published as soon as possible. DON'T LET ME DOWN AGAIN, KISS!!"
2,I'm leaving Las Vegas...,"It's never been more true than with this selection... READ BEFORE YOU BUY! Like the many other reviews posted here, this is a waste of money. I was extremely dissapointed to find only 4 in concert songs as the main attraction and not a full concert. When will they come out with a FULL CONCERT on DVD? The sound quality is poor here and the song selection is not amongst my favorites from the first three albums... except Rock and Roll All Nite. I havn't even bothered yet to view any of the bonus material. Why?"
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed. Only four songs. Very little or no crowd noise. It just did not have the feel of a real live show.
1,Embarrassing!,"I'm embarrassed I bought this DVD.But in all fairness to the band, this DVD is unauthorized. From what I've read the band does not want this released, but since the company who staged this event owns the rights to the performance, they can legally sell copies. But I'm sure the band is getting paid, or I'm sure Gene would have sicked his lawyers on them. The ""bonus"" material is interesting but could have been edited. I'm assuming the company in question is trying to recoop some money lost on this event."
1,Minnie Vanilli Revisited!,"I'll keep it short. Lip synced!! The camera angles change really fast to keep you from noticing it's a bogus performance. Also, peter criss isn't really playing the drums, and it shows. How sad for these guys. Finally, the Kiss impersontor band actually plays and sounds just as good or better than the originals. Oh, one more thing. The sound was hard to get to play on the extras; was ready to return it but it somehow started to play afterI hit every remote/home theater control button. Anyhoo...You want a good concert DVD?, try Alice Cooper Brutal Planet.....You won't be disappointed!..."
1,O-Ma-Ghog!!!!,"Alright, I was warned that there were only 4 songs but so be it. Figured at least it was a HIGH quality live recording. However, this was the most pathetic performance of a signed arena act EVER. They plodded through the songs so slow I thought Eric Carr would've climbed out of the grave. The best part of the DVD (if you want to here KISS with the energy of the 70's)is watch the tribute band footage. They blew KISS out of the water. Also the 1st black Paul Stanley I've seen. He even sounds better that Paul lately. Wish I spent the dough on BRITNEY SPEARS---------------better cheek!"
2,Live in Las Vegas?...yeah..they were alive...but that's it,"I am a huge Kiss fan and have been for many years. This was a major disapointment (wanted to check it out here before opening, but my wife did it without knowing). Well my suspicsions were correct....the DVD is says it's 100 minutes...so I figure it's a whole concert. To sum this up...the 4 songs they show are great for a Kiss fan, but this is extremely dissapointing and mostly DECEIVING because I'm sure most people will think it's a full concert. Shame on u Kiss for letting this go thru as deceiving as it it. Give us a real full concert on DVD and prove us wrong that ur just in this for the money :("
2,Pretty disappointnig,"I bought this thinking I was getting a copy of the concert in Las Vegas and what I got was a bunch of extras with 4 songs from the Vegas concert. The extras were cool, but I was thinking I was getting a whole concert and it didn't work out that way. If you're a hugh Kiss fan, you will like this, but be forewarned...."
3,"Kiss, the hottest band in the world ???","...maybe or maybe not. This DVD is not authorized by Kiss. The Sound is not as good as the supplemental stuff on the ""Second Comming"" DVD but it is in DD 5.1 and it is o.k. If you think there is a full show on the disk, you are on the wrong way. Only four Songs are available. The audience is looking very tired, specially when Gene tries to sing along with them. Anyway the show is o.k. and the DVD is worth to be seen. Not only for fans, for you too !!!"
2,KISS LIVE IN LAS VEGAS KISS SELLS OUT,IM GIVING IT 2 STARS AS KISS ROCKED THE HOUSE AS THE ALWAYS DO AND THE FIRWORKS ON THE GUITAR BUT THE DVD WAS A WASTE ONLY 4 SONGS KISS SOLD OUT.WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO PUT OUT A DVD OF A PARTY FOR SOME NEW INTERNET COMPANY OUT ON MARKET.ITS A RIP OFF AND ONLY 4 SONGS ITS A WASTE OF MONEY DON'T BUY IT DON'T RENT IT.THERES A REASON WHY IT SAYS SEE THE CONCERT THAT FATE DENIDE THEM.YOU WANT TO REAL KISS CONCERT BUY THE KISS SYMPHONY LIVE DVD THIS IS A LAS VEGAS DISASTER
1,Save Your Money!,"Two words...""... Sandwich"". Ridiculous production issues plague every piece of footage that surrounds the actual lackluster performance. The bonus footage features camera work that will make you suffer motion sickness (Tower Records signing) and horrific, inauadable audio quality as the band sleepwalks through various other appearances. I can't believe I got sucked into this one, a complete waste of money."
1,Huge disappointment,"Wow, what a disappointment! I too bought this DVD thinking it would be a full concert. So, I put in the DVD, only to find out it's four songs. The audience was so small, KISS was hardly in to it, and put on a un-energetic show, as far as KISS is concerned.And the extras? It's obvious KISS didn't contribute to this collection. It's unpolished, poor sound quality cam corder clips from various promotional events. It's like watch boring home movies!Stay away from this one!"
3,Buy or not to buy,"Alright, everbody told me not to expect too much about this dvd. As I am always curious about new kiss I was really dissapointed because of the slow playing of the wellknown songs. They sounded like kiss of courese but it would have been no missing not to have bought this dvd. the picture quality is really ok but the sound is disapointing to me. there are much better performances like the payTV concert this one rocks really."
2,Kiss Live in Las Vegas,"Word of warning this DVD only has 4 songs on it, you can watch those 4 song different ways like that is some special bonus. This is not a full concert. The one bonus is on a tribute band, has to be the worse shot stuff I've ever seen."
2,THANKS PIXELON,"This DVD is bad!Only 4 songs....Don't need to be a musician to see that the image don't work with the sound, But it is not a real Kiss Productionhere's an official declaration for this product:Paul answering to a question about Kiss live in las vegas....Some of you may have purchased or are considering purchasing a DVD or Videoentitled ""KISS Live in Las Vegas"" which is being promoted by Pixelon.com. Wewant you to know that this DVD or Video has NOT been approved, endorsed orauthorized by us. You should also be aware that the DVD or video does NOTcontain an entire KISS concert. Rather, the Las Vegas performance consistsof only four KISS songs from a limited appearance in Las Vegas for thelaunch of the Pixelon web site."
1,KISS...RIPP OFF IN LAS VEGAS,Well I was hoping for an entire farewell tour show. Something to remember that night when I saw KISS on their farewell tour. INSTEAD i get this four song piece of [trash]. With all these quotes from Paul & Gene about how they owe everything to their fans and the farewell tour was to show their gratitude. Well I guess this video was to makeup for all that sentiment and royally ... anyone who buys it. I hope I can get a decent trade in for it at my local used CD store. I've seen bootlegs that are higer quality than this. The packaging is totally deceptive. THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!
1,Gimme Gimme Gimme,"OK, so it's no secret that Kiss would bottle their own breath if they thought it would sell. That said; there's really no excuse that would allow any band of conscience to market something of such dubious quality. I wish it were possible to still think of Kiss as the cartoonish yet still awe-inspiring quartet they once were. Now that they have replaced 2 original members with imposters in effect and admitted (at least Gene has)that money, not the music, is the driving force behind Kiss, well they just come off as manipulative and sad. I'm giving up my commission in the Kiss Army."
1,Unauthorized!!!,This dvd was a bad choice I made a couple of years ago. I finally got rid of this at my local store today and a year later it is gone. I do not recommend this title so save your money.
1,I know Kiss is greedy but this is an all time low,Ok Kiss releases more greatest hits albums than most bands ever hope to make new albums and they all have the same songs but why on earth is it necessary to make a dvd with 4 songs. Kiss isn't that low on monjey that they need to rip us off with junk dvds but they seem to find it entertaining to rip off there fans/ I really like Kiss but who needs a dvd with 4 songs that are put on everything Kiss does lately. I wouldn't even recommend this to a die-hard fan this is just a rip-off.
1,The Historic [bad deal]!,"This is terrible. Did KISS actually have anything to do with this DVD? If they did, so much for their love of the fans. This DVD is a total rip from beginning to end. The outside of the DVD makes you think as though KISS pulled this out of their vaults, when after watching it you think they pulled it out of their toilet. I had a feeling KISS was starting to get carried away with making money, but know it is clear with this DVD.""You Wanted the Best, You Got the WORSE"" Save your money."
2,Not impressed,"I have to agree with most of the reviews. This is a major disappointment. I never thought I would see the day that I would buy a KISS dvd of a ""live"" event, only to find it is lip sync-ed. I forgave them for the WCW ""God of Thunder"" lip syncing, because I figured ""It's only one song, why bring all the equipment"". But this is bad. If they are going bring all the pyro, why not play it live?The dvd is pretty of boring, overall. The only thing that I can think of is that maybe this is not an officially licensed KISS product, and the band did not have any say so as to what went in and what didn't. If you notice the dvd is put out by Pixelon, which is the company who sponsored the event. So KISS may not have anything to do with it.I certainly hope not."
1,Kiss Dead in Las Vegas,"I just got this Dvd like the 1st reviewer. I was hoping for a all out [kick] final tour show. I have seen these guys live, and if they endorsed this has their farewell tour and a way to thank the fans that bought their records & Cds I say ""I wanted the best and I got the worst."" With only 20 minutes of concert time shown I can not believe a band named ""Kiss"" would do this. I say, ""Forget about this one, don't waste your 20 minutes, or your money."
2,Don't take it out on KISS,"Yes, this DVD is sub-par - only 4 lip-synched songs featuring quick cuts and the band is lip-synching but don't blame it on KISS - this DVD is not authorized by KISS and not promoted by KISS - it is an un-authorized release. Real fans already know this."
2,FOR TRUE KISS FANS ONLY,I COULD NOT WAIT UNTIL THIS DVD CAME OUT .BUT IT LET ME DOWN BIG TIME THE EXTRA STUFF ON THE DVD WAS GREAT BUT THE SO CALLED LIVE IN LAS VEGAS WAS BAD I HAVE BEEN A FAN EVERY SENSE THE 70'S AND COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD PUT OUT A DVD AND CALL IT LIVE WHEN IT WAS WITH OUT A DOUT BEING LIPPED WATCH IT CLOSE AND YOU CAN SEE WHAT I MEAN THE BAND REALLY LET ME DOWN WISH THEY WOULD ... GIVE ALL OF US FANS A TRUE LIVE VIDEO FROM THE BEST LINE UP PETER PAUL ACE AND GENE.BUT AS A TURE FAN ANY THING I CAN GET OF THE BAND I'M GLAD TO HAVE. HOPE THEY DO BETER NEXT TIME THEY PUT SOMETHING OUT
2,warning only 4 songs,"WARNING, THIS DVD HAS ONLY 4 SONGS ON IT! Don't buy it if you are assuming its a full concert. Don't buy it, wait for them to put out a full concert like they should. This DVD will probably appeal to the hard core KISS fan, but if you're not DON'T BUY IT. If you've ever seen them live you will be very disappointed in this DVD. It looks like something they quickly put together to make a fast buck. (KISS would'nt do that would they?)"
1,totally lip-synched piece of garbage,I have been a fan of kiss since the early 70's and was hoping I'd finally get to see a DVD concert of theirs. It was an impulse buy and I didn't check amazon first. Shame on me. I only saw one review that mentioned possible lip-synching but they dismissed the thought and concluded it was live. [anyone] can see that the music was totally dubbed. The most obvious is that Peter's drumming doesn't match the audio at all (watch the multi-angle version). Sometimes Paul's singing starts before he's even at the mic. Ace's fingers aren't quite moving with the solos (when they even show him) and the background vocals have way too many background singers. How could no one notice this before. Hello!??!!!? This plus all the negatives everyone else has already mentioned equals a total waste of money and a very sad day for Kiss fans.
1,What a RIP-OFF!!!,"Kiss might as well should have mugged me on the street for the $... that I spent on this DVD. I can't even fathom that they would do this! The back of the DVD case more than leads you to believe that this is the complete concert and not just 4 songs. Heck, the DVD is titled ""Live in Las Vegas, The Unseen Concert"". Not the unseen 4 songs from the Vegas concert. I wanted the best, but I got the worst! DON'T BUY IT!!!"
3,"Not too bad, not too good.","It's pretty cool to watch but no too great. I just like to hear ""Love Gun"". Another disappointment is that they're lip syncing their songs. It's their own voices but it still kinda sucks. You can clearly see Paul make a mistake by walking too far away from the mic and having to hurry back but his voice is already hear saying ""LOOK OUT"" in the middle of ""Love Gun"". He smiles at the crowd as he notices his mistake. It's not really a waste of money but it's not really a must have either. But they look great."
2,This ... is bad.,"I was so [mad] when I got this home. I had bought it because right on the box it says, ""Over 100 minutes of footage"". I thought, ""Great! I can finally show my kids a Kiss concert!"" and I took it home. There's only four songs!!! That's not a concert - ... I guess the 100 minutes includes everything including the interviews. The only reason this doesn't get 1 star is because of the extras that are included."
1,couda been great.......but sucks,"DVD of original KiSS.The show was very good, but very short set, 4 songs.The director (or editor) is a jackass, he uses all the camera angles and switches all the time, its nausating.Dont waste your time on this, for you cant watch the show because of its constant angle flashing, too bad too."
1,Waste of money!,"Sure wish I would have read the reviews but they were buried far down the page. How shocked must I have looked when I put the DVD in my player, and 4 songs later, the concert portion is over. If I were someone hurting for money I'd ask for a refund from Amazon, but for now I'll take this as an expensive learning experience."
1,The Big Flopper,"I bought this DVD and was excited to see a full length concert with the blood,fire and theatrics. This DVD [is awful]. It says on the cover the never seen concert. I wish I had never seen it. It only had four songs on it which only lasted about 20 min. I got to see more of the cover band performing than I did the original band. If I wanted to see the cover band I would have bought a DVD that said ""Kiss cover bands"". This is a waste of my time and money."
4,AN OK KISS MINI CONCERT,"First off all the preivous postings FAIL to mention this fact,This was Not a full concert,This was Advertised[at the time of the event back in 0ct of 99]A promotional event for a New internet company,called Pixelon,The Who,Dixie chicks,Brian setzer,and Kiss all made apperances ther in Vegas for this event,this was heavily advertized as such and many KISS websites stated this as well,Also it was suppossed to be broacast on the Net,[the WHOLE event not just KISS]but problems arose and it wasnt shown,this DVD shows the KISS portion of the event,Their small set is Ok,4 songs only done,on a smaller scale than their Headline shows the extras are ok as well But the Dvd Makers should have stated it was a partial showing of a much larger Event,On the plus side the multi angle feature is cool and the footage of old events[Move premire footage walk of fame footage are cool as well,overall for KISS Fans who need to have everything,I liked it"
1,Total Crap,This concert is a waste of your hard earned dollars.If you are a true kiss fan like me then you would be really P.O'D to think that you would get this ripped off.Save your money and buy something worthwhile.As once again I say this is total crap.
2,Avoid,"I am an avid Kiss fan...but this is garbage. The band look completely bored...so do the crowd...ther are only 4 songs, and the extras look like my grandma shot them. A blatant rip off, don't get sucked in."
1,Stop wasting our time and taking our money,"I'm a huge KISS fan. KISS fans know there are hundreds of concerts they could put on DVD. Can we get a full-length make-up concert for crying out loud? This DVD just has a few songs. I wish Gene would concentrate on why we like KISS and less time on making KISS coffins...credit cards....Live CD's and DVD's, preferably stuff we haven't heard or seen before. Let's get it right for a change."
3,Worth it for the extras,"True,this is not a KISS approved DVD,but it has tons of extra footage that make it worth the $$."
1,this DVD Sucks!,"Ok, I bought this disc because I really wanted to see it! I am a life long KISS fan, but this thing is a complete [waste of money]. Basically you're paying for five yes five songs. The footage looks to be so over produced that somehow, it looks like kiss is lipsyching with the music. Though in most parts it is obvious that the music was recorded live. There is almost NO audiance noise excpt what was looped in after the fact..."
3,STOP CRYING,"THIS IS THE WHOLE CONCERT!,, some of you need to do more research before you buy,,this is not live in las vegas,, this is lip sync in las vegas,,the 4 songs are great, for what they are,,, paul and gene, were not happy with this,, they tried to stop the release,, but could not ,, this is not a mercury records release,, this is a pixelon.com release,all in all its ok, but DO NOT blame KISS, its not their fault."
1,Kissed Off!,"Gene Paul Ace and Peter ought to be ashamed of themselves for putting out this garbage. 4 songs with lightning fast camera angles, so fast it'll make you carsick! Then when the 4 songs are over they replay the same songs with different camera angles.I've bought alot of things from Kiss over the past 20 + years but this is the single worst item next to Kiss toilet paper i've ever purchased. Save your money folks, I wish I did!"
1,Give Gene $immons more money,"WOW! Now I can see why they did not show this on TV.. They could not make any money from loyal KISS fans like myself. I would assume this DVD was put together in Gene's kitchen as they were thinking 'how can we get more money from our fans' I guess the endless touring on the Farewell tour was not enough. One of the greatest rock acts is nothing more than a continued way for Gene and Paul to make money. Not that making money is a bad thing; if your going to make a DVD with an actual concert, then lets make it happen and I'll purchase the DVD. Don't give me 4 songs that are poorly mixed and pass this off as a concert. I am too old to continue spending money on crap!"
2,NOT An Official KISS Release!!! Caveat Emptor!,"KISS Live in Las Vegas is NOT an official KISS release. The band attempted to stop the release of this DVD, but failed. The company that put it out cashed in on the rights that they had acquired to this show and released what is generally accepted as a very poor DVD.Only a few songs, not the best camera work or sound quality - this is for completists only. When even KISS doesn't want something released, you know it is very likely to be pretty bad....Buyer beware."
1,Just get Kinks Kontroversy and Greatest Hits...,"...and call it good (for a start). Kinks Kontroversy is where Ray Davies' songwriting achieves liftoff -- one great song after another, even the blues reworks sound awesome!The first two kinks albums are a few great singles surrounded by filler (arguably, OK). Not the best place to start. If you want the singles, get the Greatest Hits.Song for song, Kink Kronikles is probably the best intro to the Kinks, but its focus is not hits, it's songcraft. Lots of obscure gems, the album that conviced me.And then buy their other 10-15 great albums, e.g. Face to Face, Something Else, Village Green, and so forth.Enjoy the ride!"
2,Poorly made and tears quickly,"While it fits the 475 well, you will find that it tears at the snaps soon after installation and bleaches quickly in the sun even with periodic applications of Vinylex. Yet it costs as much as a good car cover. Unless you can make your own, you're stuck with another kind-of-lame part from the General Motors of BBQ manufacturers."
5,this a worthwhile read,"maybe it is about time that we all as a society pay more attention to our youth. must read. so many attitudes and behavior patterns are established at this age, that then are carried to adulthood. Many say that we are not out of this age until we reach our 40tis"
3,Purveyors of extreme dark metal.,"Just wanted to let it be known that these guys are death/speed metal. I believe they're from London, and they have released many more albums than Amazon shows. ""Breeding Chaos"" is a good disc, but ""As The Rain Gently Falls"" does the trick too. If dark metal is your thing, I suggest you drink the Blood Of Christ."
5,Men love Mash,"I was never a fan of Mash, but my husband absolutely loved the show. I starting buying him the series and decided to give it a try myself. Now, I am hooked. Most men love this show and can watch it over and over again. Women, give it a try and you will get hooked, too."
5,Master Mini-Glock Review,"Lenny Magill provides excellent information on handling your Glock pistol safely, as well as displaying how to completely disassemble and maintain your weapon. He gives many tips on defensive shooting and concealment methods. The video is thorough and professional. Lenny Magill is an expert in defensive protection."
3,"Good and easy, but not fantastic","Guess I was expecting more. It's easy to read and explains menopause and possible foods to eat, which is what it promises. But, read the entire thing in 20 mins. Seemed to simplified in some areas. A nice resource, though."
2,Eh...,"The movie was really good, but compared with the book I was a bit disappointed.. I feel they didn't portray some aspects of the characters, especially Rain.. Anyway, there wasn't even a Novella of the new book, Gathering Clouds.. that was the main reason I wanted the movie. Because I read from a V.C. Andrews fan site that they are sold with the DVD and got the link to buy the movie from that website. So that really irritated me. And now I can't even find the novella with a DVD. So if anyone knows how I can get that Novella, let me know because I wanted to read it. :)Thanks."
3,Book is better,The movie was okay. But the book is so much better. They left out so much.If you ever seen Flowers in the Attic by the same Author that was very good.
3,Pleasantly Surprised,"I ran across this when I was looking for something to watch on Netflix. I read the book when I was in middle school and I liked it so I figured I'd watch it. I thought even if it wasn't good, I could laugh at it. While there were some kind of corny laughable moments (the first 30 minutes of the movie in the hood), there were a lot of good moments also. It was obviously a little low budget but if you take it for what it is, it's a decent movie. I only wish they included some important things they left out from the book."
1,what the heck!,"this was the worst film version of a book that i have ever encountered. the acting was terrible...point blank. they deviated from the book way too much. they should have just stuck with the original plot. anyway, these people ought to be ashamed of themselves for wasting 1 hour and 20 minutes of our time!"
4,Rain by V.C Andrews Movie vs Books,"While the movie was good. As a movie alone it was powerful and moving and had just the right touch of Hope and Fantasy that every Girl dreams of. However, In Comparison to the book I was rather disapointed, there was much left out of the story and many loose ends that those not following the Books will be left to wonder about. Watch the movie before you read the books or Vice versa its up to you but In my Opinion the power of V.C. Andrews' Books Set the Stage for your Imagination Better than hollywood ever could."
3,Rain review,"This was an unexpected treat. I enjoyed the performance by Brooklyn Sudano as the main character Rain. Personally I never heard of the film, but when I'd seen previews of it on another dvd I was watching I went online to order it. It was good to see actor Robert Loggia who'd always been one of my favorites. Faye Dunaway's performance as the grandmother was grand! And another actress I admire is Khandi Alexander from CSI:Miami fame. If you want to see a good drama with lots to offer, this is it. After seeing Rain go thru all the heartache, pain, and terror she did and come out on top was inspiring!"
4,I could give 5 stars to the 1st part ..but the second.........,"The first part of the movie is awesome real action and brilliance with carter wong outshining the hero everytime. Its bad luck for the dud playing the lead role , but carter wong cannot be put second . The first part shows the maze and the training , the second is full of suprises , some that are cheesy and not needed. I felt the second part , where they leave the temple is where it starts to go a bit down .....but buy this movie the action is worth your money..."
2,Its Time to Be Serious,"Alan's book explains the Liberal View of believing only what one wishes. Alan argues that O.J. is still Innocent. In these troubled times, definitive rights and wrongs must be dealt with quickly and correctly. One can only recommend Hannity's new book."
1,And I Watch Alan's TEEVEE Show,Bless Alan's heart! God bless you Alan! This is a terrible book. It isn't even enough to get a conservative angry.
1,"Garbage in, Garbage Out","Got this as a gift and sifted through the ramblings of a mentally ill liberal. I admit I skipped a lot, but doubt I missed much. If this sophmoric tripe doesn't convince you the right is right, and the left is not right . . . nothing will."
3,Needs more liberal stuff,"I'm a liberal and this ain't liberal. I've always voted Democrat, but I don't think OJ is innocent, dude. I like freedom of speech, religion, press, and freedom to do what I want to in my home without people spying on me like Dick Cheney and John Ashcrap. I like CNN, not Fox. I think FDR was the greatest President, not Clinton. I like to ski, swim, and snorkel. Does that make me a conservative?!!??$!? I don't think so, Alan.I kind of liked how he poked fun of the stupid right wing neocons and stuff, but I wanted more conservative bashing. Another thing, why don't you bash Hannity and his all out lies, dude? Quit Fox and become a real liberal."
1,Alan's Bomb,"Well, its been over two weeks since the last reviewer submitted their review of Alan's latest wimpering tome. Its sitting at 5600 or something on the Amazon list. I've tried again to plow my way thru its dull, looney prose; Alas to no avail! Alan, sadly one comes to the final conclusion, Your book is a Bomb..."
1,What planet is Alan Colmes on?,"I'm thinking Alan Colmes should have stuck to hair-brained comedy radio before he got serious with himself. For those who are liberal, it reads like a bible but quite frankly there's nothing worth reading in this book. There are some outlandish chapter titles to get your adrenaline going, but other than that. Pass."
2,What?,Any man who thinks OJ was innocent and that Jesus would have been a liberal (pro-abortion?) lacks all credibility. This book just came out today and already a few 5 star reviews have been added. Did Alan give his family early copies of the book or something?
1,He's the Gilligan of Fox News,"Not too impressed with this book. Colmes is paid to be Hannity's fall guy, because Hannity isn't smart enough to take on a real liberal. I agree with another reviewer who saysColmes spends too much time appeasing the right. He is the straw man that Sean loves knocking down night after night on Hannity and Colmes. He's the guy everybody loves but who is always foolish and wrong.The right needs scapegoats they can laugh at. HA HA"
1,Read something by Al Franken or Michael Moore instead.,"Reviewer ""rezet"" says:""And most importantly, he sees both sides of the story. In fact, as a liberal, he will tell you in the book where he thinks conservatives are right"".How surprising that Colmes has something positive to say about the conservatives. The man makes his living as a mock ""liberal"" punching bag for a blow hard right-wing pundit. Don't take what this puppet of Fox's propaganda machine has to say too seriously. Try reading something actually critical of conservatives, like ""Stupid White Men"", if you really want to hear what liberals have to say. (...)"
2,poor,"I picked this up after reading Al Franken's books, and it was a disappointment. It's nowhere as well written and not as convincing. If you want to read something good, pick up ""Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot"" or ""lies and the lying liars who tell them""."
1,Liberal. Hah.,"Just look what book is being sold along with his at the top of the page. And then look just below that at the other books people who purchased this book have purchased. Books by Pawn Hannity, DICK Morris, and Man Coulter. Nice company Alan you big liberal you ! Ofcourse what can anyone expect ? Alan Colmes aka 'The Cryptkeeper' is Faux New's token 'liberal' he is a shill of the right wing.You have 'Sean' sitting there the Nazi storm trooper far right wing fascist bigot and then you have the person who is supposed to counter balance him who is limited to announcing commercial breaks and saying 'Gee Clinton wasnt too bad' to prove what a big liberal he is [because he liked a moderate democrat *GASP!*] now and again.I hope Faux News offices burn to the ground with everyone [Murdoch included ofcourse] associated with them trapped inside."
2,Colmes is no liberal,"Alan? Learn to have a spine, pal. Your book is weak and you fail to follow through when you take a stand on the issues. Did you even write this yourself? I bet Hannity did it for you, just like how he tells you what to say on your show. At best you're a jester over a water tank for the conservative viewers of FOX News to fling their tomatoes at; at worst, you're Hannity's pet, letting him string you along. You're not a real liberal, Alan. Stop trying to act like one."
1,Give it a rest Alan!,As I've said before NATIONAL HYPNOSIS!!! Liberals want to dupe the masses into believing that modern Conservatism and Lberalism are different ideologies (they both come from Hegel and Machiavelli the philosophies that gave birth to Communism and Facism).
1,Don't donate to FOX's agenda.....,...instead scroll down a few inches to the similar authors and read some books from some educated liberals who don't water themselves down for Ruport Murdoch.
3,It's a shame,"that books such as this outsell far better, yet little known, books such as ""The Fight is for Democracy"", which better outlines the basis and neccessity for liberal democratic thought post-9/11. Obviously the difference is that Alan Colmes is ""famous"" - although the reviewer above is absolutely correct that he is not much more than a conservative whipping boy. This is not an outstanding book, but I suppose liberals should at least be glad that a book such as this is finding its way into the hands of Amazon buyers more often than Bill O'Reilly's or Ann Coulter's new books. However, it would be far better if serious books by knowledgeable (yet relatively unknown) liberal thinkers (such as the book referenced above) were more popular. You, dear reader, can do your part by seeking them out on this site and helping them to the top of the best seller list."
3,Colmes is the only liberal with some sense,"Does mavaughn for Ohio really believe that Saddam did not have WMD's. It is clear to every knowledgeable person that he did, he used them and he was in the process of developing them again. ""READ THE KAY REPORT"". Bush was smart enough and courageous enough to realize this threat and deal with it. Mr. Colmes has enough sense to give credit where credit is due and not just oppose this administration because they are Republican. You liberals have absolutely know clue what you are talking about.This book is a decent read even though I disagree with about 99% of what Alan Colmes believes in."
3,White People Fear the Truth,"Alan Colmes does a fair job broaching subjects white folks may find too abrasive to digest, yet he puts a spin on the issues to make them palatable to the masses. Hip, hip, hooray; finally some white guy shows the gumption to champion reality. We only wish one of you so-called purveyors of the truth had the integrity to share with the average American, the phone records of the Brown's,not the fraudulent phone records that Marcia Clark, Petrocelli and the ""Dream Team"" stipulated to, would prove OJ's factual innocence. This is what OJ's federal filings were all about and what is hidden by the United Evil Conspiracy."
3,Review of the Reviewers,"It worries me that the future of our country is left in the hands of the backyard barbque pundit wannabes that submitted material for this page. The comments are so typical of the adolecent, lockeroom level discourse substituting for informed debate and polluting our culture. No wonder so many women think we men are jerks."
1,Alan is from Pluto!!!,"The book is a Bomb, no a Total Lemon!! It just makes one pucker up in total distaste!! The Looney left dislikes the tome more than the Conservatives who listen to his drivel nightly. Please save your money and time and invest in a good and highly interesting "" Money, Blood & Power"". Alan, you seem to be a reasonably serious, good guy; but an author, you are not..."
4,A unique perspective,"Alan Colmes couldn't convince me of many of his ideas, but I had fun plodding through his efforts at ""Colmizing"" readers. He presents often quite logical (even if one-sided) interpretations and maintains a fairly open mind. Bill Clinton most likely won't achieve the ""best prez"" status he assumes history will give him, and Mr. Colmes's efforts at presenting recent events regarding the former president in the most positive light possible are often rather astonishing. Clinton should appreciate such a devoted follower. What I enjoyed most was his light-hearted and often subtle sarcasm and humor, obviously a throwback to his stand-up comedy days. He has a unique writing style and I enjoyed skimming through this book. Best of all, I wasn't raging in frustration and anger at the end of it as I often have been with other political writers. Showing respect for everyone and still conveying controversial opinions and ideology is an unusual talent."
5,The Guideposts Handbook of Prayer,"Have you ever had a hard time praying? Or, coming up with the words you need to pray? This book makes it easy. It also makes praying a more ""user-friendly"" process. It doesn't seem quite so hard with this book. It has a way of cinching the distance between you and God."
4,Buju Delivers once again,"Buju delivers once again with Unchained Spirit. The first four songs may put you to sleep but they are well produced songs. The album picks up with ""Journey"" and ""Mighty Dread"" and the dancehall style with ""women dem Phat"" The duet with rancid is not too exciting.... Throw in a live version of Pull it Up with Beres and some help from LMS, GRamps, Stephen Marley, Wayne Wonder, and you got yourself a great disc."
4,One day this might be a classic...............,"I was looking for true unadulterated, hard core dancehall music but I was bamboozled on this one. Buju twisted me up when I first heard this CD. The first 4 tracks are commercialized tracks that maybe for a radio appeal, but to me it's not Buju. I always start this CD on the 5th track and take in the true reggae vibes Buju puts on this CD. I guess after purchasing his CD ""Quick"", I was expecting a totally different vibe. My favorite tracks are: ""better must come"", ""law and order"", ""guns and bombs"" and ""women dem phat"".oNe"
3,Cultural Colonialism Reversed,"Something doesn't ring true about this album. Actually, several things. The first four tracks are nothing but warmed-over 1970s US soul and gospel - slick, inauthentic, gloopy and faintly nauseating. A ploy to crack the US market, I suspect. Buju Banton is touted as Bob Marley's true heir, but Marley firmly put his cultural stamp on other styles and made them his own; Banton merely appropriates them wholesale, and despite the Jah-talk they sound bland and remarkably unJamaican. That said, there are 12 more tracks - 48 minutes of music - during things improve considerably. But this is a deeply flawed album. If you want cultural dancehall at its finest try super-righteous Sizzla's sophisticated 'Black Woman & Child' or Capleton's hugely exciting 'More Fire'."
5,Nuff Respect!!!!,"Big up to Buju for a big big showing. This album is much closer to roots reggae and a little less dancehall than Shiloh or Inna'....it not what i expected (dancehall) but the love for roots reggae bring it tru. the lyrics are typical Buju and inspire. The music is good, but the recording is a little less than perfect. Maybe cuz, not on VP????? Nuff respect!!!! Keep on Buju....."
3,"Decent, not great","This is pretty much your standard box grater. It is 100% stainless, so corrosion isn't a headache, and it's nice and sharp. However, the metal is a pretty light gauge and not as solid as I would expect. It isn't going to break, but you could dent it fairly easily."
2,Fell Apart In Less Than Two Months,"I was attracted to the simple traditional design of this grater and I will still give it a star for that. Although I only use this item occasionally at home, I expected a commercial grade box grater made for daily restaurant use. After less than two months of very light use the box came apart at the seams. It is past the return date and now I have to spend money to buy a new one. I have posted some pictures, as you can tell by the design there is really nothing keeping it from falling apart. It is just crimped metal at the corner, no spot weld, no frame to hold it in place. I recommend you keep away from this one despite the clean utilitarian look. Tsk, tsk Amco."
2,A disappointment.....,"I am afraid this play is not of great interest. The plot is rather bland (nothing much ""happens"" here). The action is static. But worst, much of the acting is not believable. Worst here is the son ""Tony"" (portrayed by Ellis Rabb), who comes across as a dime store Kevin Kline. Rosemary Harris, portraying Julie Cavendish, is the only particularly likeable character in this drama.I am afraid this show is a yawner......"
5,In LOVE with Petula!,"WOW... Petula truly shines here! I'm naturally a rock-n-roller, but had to get this gem from Petula Clark. Hearing these songs plants your feet into another time and place. Absolute '60s joy. May God Bless You, Petula, for your contributions to an amazing musical era! If you love the '60s, GET THIS ALBUM and join the Petula Fan Club (Hmmm... I'll have to look that up!)."
2,O.K.,I adore Petula Clark and think she has an amazing voice.This particular Cd did not encompass all that I had expected.
3,CD quality not great,"The songs on this CD are absolutely tops, but the quality of the CD itself is not great. It skips easily when played on a CD player (there are no visible scratches on the disc), but worked OK when I put the music into iTunes."
3,An okay collection,"Pet Clark had a big hit ""Downtown"" and after that one her career was mediocre at best. This CD contains all her hit records but like I said, after ""Downtown"" it was down-ward."
3,Good Collection,"Overall I bought this for a sampler of PC's music, bascailly I got what I wanted, but not being a big fan found a lot of cuts just not all that interesting. Sound quality is good, song selection is fine, I had hoped to discover some interesting songs, that didn't happen for me."
5,Outstanding Collection and Remastering for Pet Clark,"This cd is an excellent collection of the best known Petula Clark songs. Petula and her arranger/producer Tony Hatch were a team much like Dionne Warwick with Burt Bachrach and Hal David. The songs, production and Ms. Clark'svoice are in peak form throughout this collection. The remastering is a sonic delight.Never mind the inferior MP3 version...if you grew up listening to these songs as I did you'll agree this is the best they've ever sounded. Petula is a pop legend on both sides of the Atlantic, and this compendium of tasty 3 minute masterpieces are a testament of how great pop music can be when its done right."
4,Great feel good book but not a lot of business info,"Dave Thomas autobiography (if you want to call it that) is a collection of lessons learned on what leads to success in everyday life. There is little in here about the building of Wendy's and some things about his personal life but it mostly recounts the stories of those he knows and what makes them successful. For those looking for a lighter read about common sense, good values, and treating people like you would want to be treated this is a great place to go but not for a lot of business information."
4,Good Intro for kids.,"For kids, a good introduction to martial arts. Enough action to entertain, combined with principles such as respect & personal discipline."
3,Haunting Tale has touch of Film Noir,"Set in 1940s Hamilton Ontario, I thought this flick did a great job of telling the tragic story of intruige surrounding the Evelyn Dick murder trial. I thought the acting, especially by Fricker, was very good and particularly enjoyed the period setting, lighting, and music."
4,"Good, but not as much as his first album","With his 1989 album ""Philly Fillet,"" Doug Markley showed us that he is definitely a talented guitarist, capable of smooth jazz, and pounding, piercing instrumental jazz fusion. This album is pleasant and solid, but it concentrates mainly on light jazz sounds, with less emphasis on the experimental, risk-taking practices of the previous album."
4,"Good pics, but wait, there's more","I won't go into the plusses and minuses. Read the other reviews for that. It takes good pics, sure. Not great, but good. But I dropped it. I mean a good drop...onto cement. I heard the thunk and a crack and thought ""Time to get a new camera.""Surprise, surprise. I don't know what the crack sound was, as I can't see anything on the camera, but the bloody thing still works fine and has shown absolutely no effect from the hard fall. And that was a few months ago, and it's still working fine. Okay, yeah, it now broadcasts FM radio rather loudly, but still takes fine pics (just kidding about the FM). Try than with a Canaon or Nikon!"
5,Panasonic does it again with DMC-FZ30,"The FZ line of Panasonic cameras has been outstanding, now the best yet has emerged! The DMC-FZ30 has most of the features that were lacking in the DMC-FZ20, a moveable LCD, 8megapixels, and some of the menu features are now accessable via buttons. After using this camera for a month I have found it takes great pictures and the Image Stabilization and High Speed Focusing are super! The only fault I have found is that the noise level above 200 iso is un-acceptable. I'm sure Panasonic will address this problem with their next release. Until then I will continue to enjoy this model."
5,Pnansonic FZ30 digicam rocks,"the Panasonic FZ30 is almost as good as a dslr. It is almost but not equal to the dslr because the fixed lens digicam will never compare to the dslr on the shutter response. Other than comparing to the dslr, this camera has the best shutter release than most of the other digicams. The picture quality is good, and the noise problem most people complained can be taking care by softwares."
4,Pre-purchase info,"As with the previous reviews, a lot of people have done their research.As for the RAW Support, Adobe has release a Camera RAW Plugin 3.2 update (9/26/05) that supports the Panasonic FZ-30 RAW format.http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=3067This plugin will work with Adobe Photoshop CS2 and Photoshop Elements 3.As I will probably purchase this in the next few weeks, I will update my review."
1,Great Camera if you get one that works,"I purchased FZ30 in early December 2005, in early January it died, wouldn't turn on. I sent it in for warranty repair, they replaced a fuse and returned it, it died again in exactly the same way in early February, they replaced a fuse and returned it again. It has now died in exactly the same way for the third time. Panasonic customer service refuses to replace the camera and I'm stuck in an endless loop. Panasonic service is terrible. If you are unfortunate enough to have warranty problems forget it."
1,DOESN'T PHOTOGRAPH UFO'S WELL!,"Unfortunately there have been people that have had to rely on this camera to capture images of a UFO, but when published amongst their peers, have been seen possibly as a street light. That's obviously the fault of the camera, and it's no doubt when you consider that Panasonic doesn't want you to know about UFO's in the first place (which everyone knows). Of course they'd embed technology to keep ANYONE from being able to properly photograph a UFO, especially if it's remained perfectly still for the duration of the evening that it was spotted. Panasonic can't hide their intentions forever, and when the UFO's grow in number they will eventually be photographed using other camera manufacturers, and then the gig will be UP."
1,Grainy Pictures-disapponting low light performance,"This camera is acceptable in bright daylight, but lower light situations result in grainy pictures. It was really noticeable. I was disppointed and returned it--other people may like the effect, though. I am ordering the Kodak P850. Kodak is known for its vibrant colors and it costs less. Best of luck to all!"
4,Social Anxiety: Book Review,"I bought this book for purposes of continuing education. It is very well done from a scientific viewpoint and I believe many people can learn a lot from it. The limiting factor of this book, in my opinion, is its 1995 publication date. In this field 8 years does make a difference in research and application information available. I would really like to see this book updated by the excellent authors, especially the last chapter which is entitled ""Chasing Away the Butterflies"". This chapter essentially deals with treatment."
4,showdown......,"Well i have seen the episodes but not in this dvd.It includes difrent episodes witch are very diffrent. The episodees are not in series ,not like shadow the hedgehog series.I think they are funny and cool because of the action and humor.~me"
3,Useful for the unwilling to draw on their creative energies,"I don't know about you, but I can easily emulate nearly every aspect of this book with flying colors. Pantheons are probably the easiest task a DM has in his campaign - all he has to do is pick several belligerently-sounding combination of sounds, call upon his knowledge of any mythos, and, presto!, a pantheon. Giving powers to specialty priests is not the hard part - the hard part is putting the motives behind the gods, at which I can't say this book succeeds too well. Unless you have a hounding desire to perfectly comply to the letter of the Forgotten Realms materials avalable, I don't see this having much success among those who want to create rather than copy."
4,A good addition.,"Useful for the culture of any demihumans your group may be encountering... I don;t find it ESSENTIAL, but it IS nice to look at every now and then...."
5,Amazon to the rescue,My daughter needed this book for a course and as usual her college bookstore did not carry it and the nearest bookstore was a 30 minute ride from her campus. The seller got her the book in plenty of time for her class. She not only enjoyed the class but this book was interesting in it own right.
2,Really a 2-piece set,"The baster bulb cracked for me too on the second use. It is terrible quality. The brush was ok, and the thermometer was fine as well. The rest was useless. Overall, it's not a bad value if you buy it understanding that you will be getting only two functional pieces: The brush and thermometer. I'd still suggest KitchenAid products instead."
2,Not as pictured,"The picture with these labels does not make clear that there are colored ""initials"" behind all the spice names. The colored letters are a fancy swirled font and detract from the clean lines I want in my kitchen. I did not find that many of the spice names I needed were included. The shipping costs were too high (twice the price of the labels!!!) and they folded the labels to fit into a box for priority mail. I would MUCH rather have had the labels in a flat envelope and saved $6 on shipping. I never used these and never returned them. I don't like them but they are not worth the cost of returning them."
1,Buy something else,"I purchased these labels because they looked the most interesting of all the ones that were being sold on this website. I purchased them to attach to a set of new glass spice jars, but they are totally inappropriate for this purpose. On the website they show up as nice writing on a white background, but in reality the labels are printed on clear tape. When you put them on a glass bottle with dark spices inside it is impossible to see the label, much less to read it. In addition the labels are not sticking to the jars. They keep coming off. I wrote to the vendor about this a week ago and they haven't responded to me yet. If you are planning to use the labels on glass jars definitely buy something else."
3,SO/SO,"Okay...i simply love a few of the songs...but i will have to admit i skip over the majority of it. I think this is one of those you either luv them or not type of groups. Bought it for the ""New Money"" song...but the novelty of that has worn off. It'll remain in my mix of CD's but not one of my favorites."
4,Is this book much different than his book Never Fear Cancer Again?,"I have purchased his book ""Never Fear Cancer Again"", and was wondering if the information in this book is different enough to warrant purchasing it as well or if it is basically the same info. Thanks.Rating is for the above mentioned book as I couldn't submit comment without rating."
5,SIMPLY GROUND BREAKING !!!!,"I have followed the advice in this book since 2005 and have not had a cold since.Raymond Francis uses his background in science, and outlines his path to health in very simple straight forward common sense advice that everyone can understand.On a broader note,this country needs to embrace Raymonds health model to save it from financial collapse due to the staggering costs in psuedo health care today.All I can is READ THE BOOK !! .:)"
5,Excellent!!!,Excellent advice and uncommon wisdom for anyone who wants to maintain their health or improve it.
5,Never Be Sick Again,Very happy with the book. Received promptly and in goodcondition. Excellent transaction.
1,never be sick again,"Amazing info but not realistically do-able. One would have to make major life altering changes and really....it's not happening.While I agree on removing chemicals and have done so within my life and it has helped but, the way this is presented here....sorry, I just didn't like the book.That being said, this is my recommendation.Great condition! arrived quickly with no issues, will use seller again!Interesting info but not the path for me. Check out how Dr St. Amand is treating this disease. I am pleased with my treatment and am on the road to recovery without the drug companies reaping benefits ($$$$) on my pain.'What your doctor may not tell you about Fibromyalgia' or anything by Dr R Paul St Amand is worth purchasing."
5,Chronic Illness,"I must admit I haven't read this book yet, but it was recommended to me by someone else with chronic illness. I look forward to getting into it."
1,Be wary,"Raymond Francis tries to convince us that his ""rules for living"" will prevent you from ever getting sick and, therefore, live longer than you could ever had imagined. His ""rules"" are based on what he tells us were the diet and life styles of generations gone by all the way back to the cave men. What he fails to explain is how people today live decades longer than the people in the past without following his rules. If fact, may of his ""rules"" contradict the wisdom of our ancestors. For example, he tries to convince us that milk is a poison (this alone should tell you that he is a quack). This is only another pseudo-health book. It's designed to take money out of your pocket and put it into his. How to do that is probably the only thing that Mr. Francis did learn from his so called studies."
5,Excellent book.,"Here is another book that does an excellent job on explaining why diets don't work, and what to do to loose wight the natural way."
5,Fantastic and Helpful,"This is the best health book I have ever read. I am a professional athlete and after implementing only a few of the practical suggestions in this book, I feel better and my performance has improved measurably. Very impressive. I recommend it to everyone."
5,Paradigm Shifting,"Decades ago, Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring permanently changed the way I thought about the environment. Never Be Sick Again has just permanently changed the way I think about health. This book obsoletes most of our existing approach to medicine. An enjoyable, informative, and must-read book. Truly paradigm shifting and highly recommended."
4,Compelling...Definitely worth a read!,"This book has really opened my eyes to the modern world we live in today. When one stops to think for a moment, we are constantly exposed to toxins from various sources throughout our daily lives. It's time to have the wool pulled back from our eyes, and that is exactly what this book aims to do. The research that has gone into this book is very interesting and thought-provoking.My only ""complaint"" about the book is that it leaves you with the feeling that it is nearly impossible to escape all of the toxins we are all exposed to, so it made me feel a bit helpless. However, there are many things we can do to improve our health that have nothing to do with the medical community. It is time we all learn that medication is not always the answer to cure our ailments. The answer may be lying right in front of you at your local supermarket."
4,Informative,"This book is well written, giving the readers ideas how to take care of their health. Prevention is considered more advisable than treatment."
4,More than I expected,"I saw the ad that Sevendust was putting out a new album as a follow up to the self titled and home a couple of years ago. Just then, I heard WAFFLE on the radio, and thought that all of the songs were going to be like that...poppy, appeal to the prep metal crowd,.... I heard the album, and was I ever blown away...wonderfully done, the guest appearences (Aaron Lewis) were well selected, and all that. Then again, it still does fall short of Home. If you want the best of the best, that is the one I recommend, though this one is worth your music dollar as well (or maybe the time taken to download, that is!)"
5,SEVENDUST ROCKS,BEST ALBUM YET. IF YOUR A TRUE FAN LIKE ME YOU SHOULD DEFINENTLY GET THIS ALBUM. THE BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM IS XMAS SONG
3,OK but not heavy enough,"I love sevendust. The self-titled album was great, despite a few tracks where rap was present (Terminator), and home was awesome with heavy and growling lyrics .... HOWEVER, Animosity, though melodic, is just not heavy enough. The guitars arent as heavy as they should be. Dont get me wrong, melody is great...and very important in an album. But songs like ""Live Again"" don't sound like rock....too soulful one could say. LaJon has an awesome growling voice....I want to see it present in the new album ""Seasons."" Any sevendust fan has got to know what Im talking about. They make better albums when they are disjointed and dont have a ""sound."" I hate having to write a somewhat unpleasant review of a band that got me into the metal scene. Sevendust is the first rock band I ever truly liked....but as I got into bands like Pantera, and Type O Negative and Tool, I look at Animosity and just feel disappointed in the lack of heaviness. ..."
5,their best cd,coming from a big sevendust fan i would have to say this is their best cd and i own them all. if you like sevendust cause of their melody than this cd is great for you and if you like them for their hard stuff then this cd is also good cause they have a few heavy tracks here aswell. any fan of melodic hard rock should pick this cd up its worth it. my favorite songs on here are shine damaged crucified and live again.
5,Sevendust Brings it all to the table,"Sevendust's third album ""Animosity"" is easily their most hard-rocking and memorable album. While not as emotionally heavy or draining as the follow up to this album, ""Seasons"" songs like ""T.O.A.B."" remind you of that person you just don't like, ""X-Mas Day"", with it's emotionally stirring chorus is easily a wonderful acoustic power ballad for the new millenium. The high mark though has to be the groove heavy ""Dead Set,"" the most intense and catchy hard-rocker of this collection. Sevendust once again prove although they do not get the full recognition they deserve, their music surpasses almost anything that fills listerners ears today. An intense and emotionally resonating experience."
3,What happend guys??,"Its like someone cut off the... of the entire band, this CD is totally soft and these guys have potential to do more with what they have. In Home, these guys simply got loose and it is one of my favorite CDs, I am pretty dissapointed with Sevendust right now. But hey, they still got their own original sound and it is much better than this Linkin Park/Alien Ant Farm/Hoobastank/Lost Prophets thing thats taking over."
2,Decidedly plain...,"I bought this album on the strenght of the clips previewed here,but after finally getting hold of the album im disappointed,its just like everything else out there,there does'nt seem to be any orginalality in most of the songs.there are stand out tracks like T.O.A.B,trust and xmas day,but all in all there are FAR better bands out there."
2,Eh....this is Sevendust?,"Sevendust, one of the few shining bands in the middle of the nu-metal explosion, really went for a more mellow edge here with 2001's ""Animosity"", and it's safe to say that it didn't work. After the surprise success of the ""Angel's Son"" single from the tribute to late Snot singer Lynn Strait and not to mention tours with Creed of all bands, vocalist Lajon Witherspoon and co. attempt a radio friendly sound here a la Puddle of Mudd, Nickelback, and the rest of the host of immitators, and sadly ""Animosity"" marks the appearance of Sevendust attempting to take the road to success by jumping on the modern rock bandwagon. Songs like ""Praise"", ""Trust"", ""Follow"", and ""Live Again"" are made for radio drivel that when compared to anything from their self titled debut or even ""Home"" lack in style and originality. Sevendust's next album, ""Seasons"" sadly continued to find Sevendust going in this direction, and not surprisingly, that album comes off as lame as well."
3,Disappointing!!!!!,I starting listening 'Sevendust' with their first album and would consider that album a HEAVY ROCK masterpiece. My favorite debut album of all time. I must have listened to it a 100 times. The next album (Home) I liked and still like but there was definately an indication things were getting a little less harsh. 'Harsh' is what I want and like from 'Sevendust'. If I want softer music with a more produced sound I will look else where. I say stick to what you do best! There are definately some edgy segments to the songs on their new album but they are wrapped up in a much softer more produced sound. I am disappointed with it.
3,Few steps shy of being great,"I've listened to Sevendust for a while now. And I'm still disappointed with what I see from them. The songs are lyrically good, along with the rest of the musicianship. What detracts however is the bands incessant desire to scream on every track, despite how the song flows. Most of the songs are quite good, but their flow is just disrupted by the screaming. I can't wait for the day that Sevendust realize their potential and figure out that they don't always need to scream in a song, and thus disrupt its flow. Proof that this can be accomplished is the song Live Again which flows very nicely and is my fav. off the whole cd. And yes I know that all the Sevendust fanatics are saying that the screaming is what makes them so great, so just take my opinion as you want, I don't care what you think."
3,Still strong...but more melodic,"I always considered Sevendust an underrated band. For one, their lead singer actually can sing which puts them miles ahead of a lot of other rock bands out there. There are some great songs on the CD, but it seems like they have kind of gone in a more commercial mellow direction. I've read interviews lately where Lajon said they want to be more successful than just going gold and it was frustrating seeing all the bands that opened for them go platinum. This album sounds like they are trying to ""fit in"" a little more. It's still a strong effort, but I was looking for something heavier."
5,Very nice,"This album is very good. I haven't heard much of otherSevendust. The drummer is like a machine and the bassplayer is very good. The two guitarists come up withinteresting riffs. Some of the slower songs aren't asgood. My favorites are ""Shine"" and ""Trust"" which arein Bb. I like the backing vocals. The lyrics are not thatspectacular. But anyway, it's enjoyable from start to finishand none of the songs [are weak] or are obnoxious so thatmeans 5 stars. By all means, check out ""Corrected"" fromthe Scorpion King soundtrack..."
2,Awesome album with brutality worth owning,"Sevendust is just unpredictable in their sound they have a very good charisma that no other nu metal band has and this album proves it. Their niche seperates them from all the other weak metal bands like Nile, entombed, 3 inches of blood and morgoth just listen to the riffs they're astounding in creativity and not cliche like most doom metal bands. All in all in it's simplicity it is a well thought album full of ear ripping riffs and chaos this release is definitely a must have for any fans of TRUE metal not that grindcore/death sh*t"
5,One of the Best CD's I've Ever Bought,"This is truly an outstanding CD. After waiting almost 2 years for a follow up to Home, this CD really delivers. If you like Sevendust, or just good hard rock, it's a must have. GO SEE THEM LIVE!!! I've been to 3 shows, and they are without a doubt the best band on tour these days."
4,Animosity-Sevendust,"This album, like most other nu-metal albums out there, has that heavy crunching noise inspired by Black Sabbath. Sevendust crunches just a little bit more on Animosity and it makes a big differance. The soulful singing of Lajon Witherspoon differs sevendust from the rest of pack, and for the last time just because lajon is black DOES NOT MEAN HE RAPS. there is not oe rap line on this album. the helpful shouting in the backround by drummer morgan rose adds a nice little back-forth thing on songs like praise, the first single, and redefine. This is sevendust's most melodic album with xmas day, live again (the new single) and a new version of Angels son, the tribute to late Snot singer lynn strait. all in all, the melodic singing of lajon witherspoon and the crunch of the 2 heavy guitars in the backround make for a new, refreshing nu metal experiance. buy this album"
4,Pretty Good,"Pretty good albumn. Does not have a lot of staying power. Listened to it like crazy when I first got it, but now it is collecting dust. Angel's Son is a sweet song though. A lot of emotion and great music in that song."
5,metal you can groove to,Sevendust is jammin'. Open your mind to their music and get inspired. Melodic as can be heavy metal with a hip-hop and techno influences. Their singer is of color and his bandmates are white. That I find super cool. It only helps against prejudice and racism in music these days just because. Nu-metal with soul. Not so popular like Korn or System of a down; Sevendust has that on their side too. I love underrated kick ass bands!
4,I CAN FEEL THE MUSIC SO MUCH!,"EVEN THOUGH THE GUYS HAVE MELLOWED OUT A LITTLE, I COMPLETELY DIG EVERY SONG ON THE ALBUM. IT'S THAT SEVENDUST GROOVE I CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF, I LOVE IT. IF YOU ARE A TRUE SEVENDUST FAN, THEN YOU SHOULD LIKE ANIMOSITY JUST LIKE YOU LIKE HOME AND THEIR FIRST CD. THEY RULE NO MATTER WHAT!"
5,The best Sevendust CD yet!,"I have all the Sevendust CDs and this one is the best! Sevendust originally recorded about 40 songs and took the best 13 and put them on this CD! There are no quiet and boring songs, only heavy metal here! I definitely reccomend this CD."
2,Hitchock would have been offended by the comparison.,"Midnight Fly was promoted as Anita Mui's first effort with English; too bad she didn't speak up. What is audible is how uncomfortable Mui is speaking the language, so why use it at all? I was excited about the pairing of Mui and Simon Yam but this film was a waste of two wonderful talents. I'll give five stars photography, but as a thriller in the traidition of Hitchcock -- the master would have been offended."
2,"Glenn in Durham, NC","With a few exceptions, this collection is just a tired retread of a bunch of songs that have appeared on various ""Jock Jams,"" ""Jock Rock"" and ""Greatest Sports and Jock Jams"" collections. The addition of alternative/dance artists like Moby, Fatboy Slim and Groove Armada does little to offset played-to-death radio fodder by Britney Spears and N'SYNC and old chestnuts like ""Get Ready for This"" and ""Whoomp! There It Is"" which have appeared on countless other similar collections."
5,THE ALL-STAR JOCK JAMS VARIOUS ARTISTS,I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS CD FOR ALONG TIME AND I FINALLY HAVE IT GREAT GAMEDAY CD.
2,Not Satisfy,I bought these items but was not happy with shipment when received. Company sent me wrong items in package. I emailed them and told me to send it back and will receive shipping $. I sent items back and they sent back to me again last week stating I did not check reason why I was returning products after we were back and forth through emails. Now I have send it back and keep losing money by sending them back. Not happy and satisfy with company and products.
1,THUMBS DOWN!,"I thought this was a great deal and at first was pleased with all the accessories. However, I began to realize after the car charger quit working by the third charge, that this was not such a bargain. I was left with a completely dead phone in the car and was unprepared. Also, the leather case that came with this is stiff and awkward. I wound up spending more money on a set from verizon, and that set is clearly a higher quality (both charger AND leather case) and worth it."
2,Cheap,"I was not impressed with this product. The product was cheap and for the price, I think I could have done better. The case fit and I will use it but the whole package was not worth the money. I ordered 2 and wish I would have looked for a better quality product."
4,Good Demonstration of Why You Should Move,"This is one of the better Lenny Magill videos I have seen. He does a good job demonstrating the options for movement; forward, back, lateral, diagonal, etc...from several different angles. He discusses the reasoning and then shows several force-on-force excercises using Simunitions as well as three real incidents.At the end, you should be convinced that moving is a key survival technique. The video does not explain how you hit the target while moving. That, as with any self defense skill, will have to be learned in a hands-on class and through practice."
1,Useless,"I am a massage therapist and was looking for a book on how to incorporate hot stones into my massages. I was EXTREMELY dispappointed with this book it is more of an advertisement for ""La Stone"" classes. Don't spend your money."
5,Greatest band ever!!!,"The first CD I listened from Saviour Machine was Legend II and since that time they became my favorite group. I almost cry when I listen to this CD, it blows my mind and I admire the talent of this group for making music so perfect and beautiful, along with the incredible voice of Eric Clayton this is how music must be done for God, perfect in every way. I highly recommend this and any CD from Saviour Machine to all the people who likes good rock opera music."
4,Everybody in the office loves this monitor stand,"I'll bet I have purchased 5 different types of monitor stands over the past few years for workers under my supervision. This is the one that seems to be best liked by the employees. It looks good and can be adjusted to meet varying requirements. Solidly packed, easy to put together. Recommended."
5,Good buy,Great monitor riser. It's very basic. You just remove the number of pieces that you need to from the legs to get the stand to the right level. It's simple and works great!
4,bennjeri,"Very nice product; however, measurements are not accurate. I purchased the one that measures 15"" x 12"" and my 12"" laptop DOES NOT fit under the stand so I had to return it for a larger model."
5,Perfect,We love these. We had an ergonomic evaluation and risers were recommended for many of the staff members. The best part is that they are adjustable for height. Everyone is so happy with these risers and no more neck pain!
3,height increments too large,"The legs assemble with 1.75 inch sections. Although that seems to provide a good amount of height control, the platform was either too low or too high for my comfort."
3,Didn't work out for me.,"I sent this back, it didn't work out for me. The construction was great, I loved how it was adjustable, but even without any extra legs on it it was just too high for me."
5,"Simple, nice-looking, height-adjustable monitor stand","Recently, I tried to mount my two 24"" Asus monitors on pivoting monitor arms. When I found out that my monitors didn't have VESA mounts on the back, I had to scrap that idea. So as a plan B, I chose to get two of these adjustable-height monitor stands. Specifically, I purchased an extra-wide one for my main monitor, and this more regular-sized one for my second monitor.I like the two stands very much. The monitors had different bases on them, so I have one at 1/3 full height and the other at 2/3 full height. (In case you are wondering, these stands can adjust from approximately 0""-4.5"" in height by 1.5"" increments.)The two stands together, along with my black monitors, look classy and were easy to assemble. For a relatively inexpensive price, I highly recommend these if monitor arms or other mounting solutions will not work for you.Jon"
5,Monitor Stand,I needed a stand where I can put a small LCD TV on and be able to store things under the stand. This works. Thought price was a little high but couldn't find anything else that I thought could work. I'm happy with the overall product.
4,Rizal's Contribution in Shaping A Nation's Fate,"This masterpiece work of literature written by the famous asian historian Gregorio Zaide, tells us of the contribution of Doctor Jose Rizal in shaping and awakening the entire nation from the pit of corruption and injustices. For those of you young Filipinos there....read this book. This will ignite a flame in your heart...the flame of patriotism. Because of the hellish political instability, poverty uprising in our country, I think patriotism and love for country will solve our countlessproblems...for if we have love...we will not only think of our own good but we will be directed to the thought of serving the country FIRST before our own interests. The book will indirectly teach you how to destroy that greed in your heart and love your country..."
3,Good video,"The scientific Angler videos are a little antiquated. I enjoyed watching them, however, watching them felt like taking a time machine back 30 years."
4,"I know, you know","I know books. I read a lot. I know how to spot things that I like in books. I spotted many things in this book that I like. Believe me! I know, and now you know"
3,I must know more,I read the previous review by C. Milton and his review makes this book sound like a classic. On the other hand The Changing Seaway is not really as imformative as I had hoped. It dramaticized the cargo ship scene and I would suggest possibly more detailed books if you are intrested in this topic. Now I know stuff!
5,Amco 4 piece stainless steel measuring spoons,"I love the set of stainless steel measuring spoons I ordered through Amazon.com. They are so durable compared to the other plastic spoons I've owned, which always seemed to be getting chewed up making it almost impossible to read the unit of measure on the spoon. Also love the round shape and long handles that make getting into small places much easier. I plan on having these quality spoons around for years."
1,Low quality. Black metallic residue on spoons.,"These spoons are 18/0 stainless steel. That means it is composed of 18% chromium and 0% nickel. Nickel is added to stainless steel for corrosion resistance and durability. 18/10 is better than 18/8 stainless steel, and 18/8 is better than 18/0.There are spots of black metallic residue all over the spoons. I don't want whatever this stuff is in my food. There are also cracks around the rim of one of the spoons.I'm disappointed with these measuring spoons and will probably discard them."
1,NOT AS PICTURED,"the spoons i received are not the ones in the picture. (I have the ones in the picture which are amazing and was trying to order more). the ones i got have an annoying sort of tail on the end of the spoon and the bowl part of the spoon has a flat bottom, not round. Annoying! they look trashy, not a pleasing shape at at. not the streamlined, clean shape i was looking for. yuck."
1,Excuse me....GORE LORD???,"GORE LORD? You have GOT to be kidding me. The band name is a laugh riot in itself! And look at those song titles! Ridiculous, even by death/black metal standards!Thank you, Gore Lord, for making me laugh again. Next time I need a good laugh, I'll just pop your CD in and let the good times roll!"
4,Not bad,"Gorelord is a really bad name. Song titles are not really new, people probably are familiar with Cannibal Corpse and think this is just anther rip off band. What about the rest of the cd? Anyone listen to it? I actully have listened to the cd. The songs are sicker then Cannibal Corpse, the vocals are better then Corpse, and the singer actully plays guitar and bass. So I give him props for playing alot of the instruments. Cd isnt really that bad, just the name."
1,"A Review of ""Gorelord""","First of all, the bands name is Gorelord, which basically sums up just about how good the music will be. This one should really make you laugh. If it doesnt, yo have no sense of humor at all. Take some time to study the awesome song titles: ""Necrophilic Orgy in Entrails and Cum"" is a perfect example. If you dont know what a necrophilic person is, its someone who has sex with dead people, and i dont even listen to this abysmal genre. I was lucky to find a cd with such quality music. And the Intelligent reviewers that gave this one 5/5 stars such as Japanese Grindfreak & RottingCorpseBreath need to be introduced to more upbeat music. Im sure theyll be watching ""The Devil's Rejects"" fairly soon or sucking their ugly girlfriends blood, etc. This cd gets 1 star of five, if zero was possible thats what I would give it."
1,It must have lost something in the translation ...,OK the cover says that the author has established himself as an intrepid explorer of an uncharted sexual landscape ......I'd sayMatter of fact it's uncharted cause no one wants to go there. It's a very disjointed story with seeming witty and trite expressions interspersed throughout the book .... obviously not my style of book or erotica ....
4,"Pain, joy, disease and parenthood","Richard Cohen has endured many obstacles. It is a moving (and reluctant) memoir about a progressive neurological illness and how it permeates all aspects of his life. He has acomplished so much, when many others would probably give up or be paralysed with depression caused by this illness. Read the book, and look at your life differently. His children's reactions and adaption to his problems is written in a very special way."
2,The end seems tagged on,"Even though Cohen claims to be coping, and who am I to judge since I am not in his position, he mainly seems angry. I don't blame him. The last chapters, my lovely wife and we are so happy, seems artificially tagged on, as if an editor complained. I don't think he is 'lifting his life above illness.' But then, I doubt I, or anyone else, could"
1,sad,"Mr. Cohen is a huge black hole; I once did not feel his love for his children...my impression is that he was after all a very lucky man. he managed to put up with a demanding career, had the big luck in a great woman and I think wonderful kids...Instead of bitching so much, be thankful Mr. Cohen for what you have! In other country or other financial situation you would be long gone."
1,From the first page..,I really didn't like this book..from the first page. I never did try to pick it up again. Not worth your time.
2,"A long, angry whine.","This book is one long, angry whine. Page after page, the author repetitiously complains about his illnesses and their symptoms. He recounts how he dumps his, seemingly unlimited, anger on his children and his long-suffering puerto rican wife. He just fails to accept his lot and 'get on with it'. Instead, his constant crying and moaning makes this book a long, tedious read. His bad luck was being born into a family suffering from inherited Multiple Sclerosis. His good luck was meeting a woman who has put up with his constant anger and complaints, given him children, kept the family together and provided all the financial support. His life could be worse - he could be on welfare."
5,A Book That Needed To Be Written,"""A Reluctant Memoir"", the subtitle states, but this truly is a book that needed to be written, by the author and for the reader. The philosophy that emerges on these pages could only result from actual life experience. Richard Cohen has courageously chosen to forego his personal privacy to share his hard learned insights. ""Privacy belongs to those who feel they cannot reveal limitations they will not admit to themselves."", writes Cohen in this ""must read"" for anyone wanting a deeper understanding of living and loving."
3,A Reluctant Read,"Although gaining more insight into what life can be like with severe and chronic illness, I had a great deal of trouble with the way this book was written. I felt as though the author couldn't decide how he felt or where he was headed with his thoughts. I guess maybe that's what happens with a memoir -- it is descriptive. It just seemed that so many times the contemplations were strung together haphazardy. Perhaps I was looking more for a narrative and development of the characters (family). Nevertheless, I do admire survivors such as Richard Cohen."
2,surprisingly badly written,"I am glad to see that this book helped MS sufferers, so that it perhaps will do some good to persons who don't mind the quality of the prose. I was quite surprised and disappointed in the writing given Mr. Cohen's journalistic background: I found the sentences abrupt and the use of cliched phrasing abundant. Nor does Mr. Cohen himself seem particularly contemplative about what he has undergone. It may be that journalistic style simply does not lend itself to describing the understanding of an experience; it is useful to report what happens, but the nuances of an evolved response get lost. Many of the sentences and paragraphs read like bullets in a memo describing an atrocity (no argument about the diseases both being that). At the very least the book needed a sympathetic editor who could smooth out the jagged prose, but perhaps also draw more emotional processing out of him--or have postponed the book."
2,A scary read for MS sufferers,"Those of us with MS tend to stick together. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this book to sufferers of this illness. Despite his claims of optimism, the anger and bitterness of Richard Cohen are strong themes in this book. I found myself questioning whether or not I have, or ever will have, a similarly angry, defensive, and demanding effect on myself and my loved ones.Mr. Cohen has many amazing professional and personal accomplishements and I was hoping to read about how this man had managed to create such a full life for himself in spite of his obstacles. Instead of hope I found fear."
4,Great Book,Really good look at how chronic illness impacts not only your life but those around you. Great point of view from someone who's been there.
1,DEFECTIVE DVD,"I bought this DVD for my husband's birthday present. He tried watching it today, and it starts in the second quarter. Needless to say, I'm returning it."
5,Solid and Attractive,"I bought to hold up a large white board which would normally wall-mount, but my office arrangement doesn't provide that opportunity. So, I have large, heavy item on easel which can be whisked away to closet storage or displayed for conceptual thinking work as needed. Glad I got the ""heavy duty"" version since writing on the board requires a steady support."
3,Lack of Quality Control,"I bought three easels to replace several we have at my workplace that are broken. Two of the three easels I received from Amazon were not property assebled as the rivets that hold the back leg to the top piece were not attached to the back leg, rendering the tripod easel worthless. The two replacements I received did not have this problem but I would warn customers that Quartet's quality control is lacking. For such expensive easels this was a disappointment."
3,Handbook of Texas Birds,"Texas is too large for any one book. Though somewhat helpful, it's mostly out of date."
3,Tos Handbook of Texas Birds,The book has a lot of written info on the birds but not enough photos to identify them.
3,Sorry Mick Gotta Tell It Like It Is,"Mick Foley is a pretty good author to be a wrestler. I enjoyed his previous two books and thats why I picked up the third. That being said its not that great of a book to be honest. In the book if Mick gets things to go his way then Vince McMahon is God. If things doesnt go Mick's way, Vince is the Devil and the people that help him are demons. Out of the three books that he wrote this is the worst of the three. Check the book out of the library if your looking for a good read when you have nothing better to do. Otherwise save your money. Foley is good but this book stinks."
1,Wrestling book?????,"This is the worst wrestling bio book ever and for one very good reason: there is no wrestling in it! Oh yes, sorry, about 50 pages out of 300 are about wrestling... The rest of the book is meaningless... I am sorry I ever bought it..."
2,Rambling and Unfocused,"There is a good book, a good story, or a good narrative in here somewhere. Unfortunately, it is completely obscured by a rambling storyline, a forced diary structure, and several hundred poor attempts at humor. The book smacks of an attempt to squeeze a few more bucks out of those who loved ""Foley Is Good"", so you have three options. Either buy the former if you want to know about Foley's life or buy one of the author's two fiction work if you want to check out some great (albeit disturbing) coming-of-age fiction, but under no circumstances waste your time with this one."
3,Hardcore Diaries,"Not Mick's best work, but he is still by far, the best author to come out of the WWE. The book itself is well written and gives you insight to how things work in wrestling. The one thing you can always count on is Mick's terrific sense of humor. After reading this, you will see Mick Foley is a big man with an even bigger heart. He truly lets you see his human side."
3,Interesting,"Mick Foley is a really interesting guy. He cares, and seems very down-to-earth. I will admit, I didn't have very high expectations for this book. I haven't read any of his others, so I really don't have anything to compare it to.I understand a bit about professional wrestling, I used to be a fan. I thought it was interesting to see how the angles get created and carried out. It's clear that by being a journal-type story, the events are taken care of in chronological order, but it seemed a bit too disjointed and jumpy for me.If Foley wasn't so personable and such a nice guy, I don't think this book would have been as easy to read. But he is a nice guy, and he very obviously cares. I hope he continues to use his celebrity to do all the wonderful things he does."
5,a good Foley Book..but not a great one,"I liked the book...it was very complete..but I wish would have more things..like DX, ECW..., I really like the part that he talk about ROH and the possibility of him joining TNA..I didn't know that one....But overall is a good book about WWE and the booking decision..something a fan don't want to miss it.."
5,"One of the best wrestling books, ever!","I love reading wrestling books to gain insight into a business that so little is known backstage. Mick Foley has always given one of the more honest insights, also more down to earth. This one chronicles his journey to ECW's One Night Stand and all the bumps in the road to. Some of the stories he shares with us really touch me when he talks about burn victims and children's hospitals, to his own child choking. Moments like those (and so many more I don't wanna give away) turn this hardcore legend into a true legend. Read this if you're a fan of the business, read this if you just want insight into a man's life with so many connections."
3,up and down mostly down,I bought this book and thought good book I finished it in 2 days and too much unappropiate words especially about chrisy canyon Mick dissapointed me
1,Mick Foley The Hardcore Diaries,"I like Mick Foley,I love wrestling books, this was without a doubt the worst book I've ever read in my life. the only reason I gave it 1 star was because I tried to leave it blank and it wouldn't let me process my review. Save your money!"
1,No One Else Mentioned It...,"I really could not enjoy this book for every reason already listed. However, no one has mentioned the one thing that made this a little tough to stomach: Foley's obsession with masturbation. After reading Tietam Brown and this book I get the feeling Foley is really, really looking forward to teaching his sons about this. I'm not saying Foley is a pedophile; I'm saying he spends way too much time writing about masturbation and teenage erections.Granted, I'm sure he thinks he's being cute and funny. Much like how he drools all over the WWE Divas (even making sure to reference masturbation) and mentions them in much more reverent tones than his wife. Just being cute and funny.This book, much like Foley himself, is self-indulgent and what I'd expect from someone who cannot accept that he was only a part of wrestling history."
1,"Self-serving, long, uninteresting","This was a major disappointment in every way imaginable. I wish I had a nickel for every time he plugged one of his own earlier works; I'd be a millionaire. How many freaking times does he have the use the phrase ""#1 New York Times Bestselling Author"". Yes Mick, we get it. You sold a lot of books. But why did you need to write another book just to brag about your earlier accomplishments?In terms of insider wrestling information which is what I was hoping the WHOLE book would be, it is again a diappointment. I actually had to skip over many sections of the book because the content was so incredibly boring.I would highly NOT recommend this book; if you are a true blue die hard Foley fan, read on his other 2 autobiographies, or rent this from the library."
5,Hardcore Diaries,Mick Foley did it again ! This book is another bestseller! Once you start reading it you can't put it down.
1,poor quality and not the same as photo,"I ordered these tongs and they are NOT the same as shown in the photo above. The one in the photo is like the Amco tongs we purchased about 5 years ago and it is a favorite -- it has automatic one-handed locking and unlocking by squeezing the tongs and holding them up/down -- NO little lever to pull/push to lock/unlock with your other hand. BUT THESE tongs do not have the same locking mechanism. They have a very cheap difficult little lever to pull/push for lock/unlock, and the tongs seem flimsier. NOT recommended."
1,Item in picture is not what is shipped,"As the previous review states, the item in the picture is not the one shipped. Both are AMCO 12"" stainless steel tongs, but like the previous reviewer, I have the original and like the one-handed, sliding rivet lock. The one shipped has a flimsy bent piece of metal which is sharp and requires two hands to lock. Guess it was wishful thinking that the previous reviewer received a product shipped by mistake, but yep, they are showing a picture different from what they have to sell. Too bad: the original is a favorite."
2,Capitalism at its finest,"Billy Blanks should be ashamed of himself. He is just using his name and slapping his face on video box covers. He has built good brand recognition and now he is capitalizing it to the max. Instead of making a true ab video that focuses solely on abs, Blanks and his production staff decided to piece together footage of his other videos. The editing is poor, at times not giving you time to transition into the next exercise, other times only working one side of your body. Save your money and buy a protien smoothie or an Atkins bar."
4,edited together for abs abs abs and more abs!,"ok, i know it hasnt come out, but I saw a clip of it, and letting everybody know whats in store with this video.It is about 55 minutes long, and it is a compilation of all the 'live' volumes, i think volumes 2-12.It wasn't redone, just all the volumes edited together.It seems to be about 25mins of kicks and some other 20 or so on toning the abs.It has many of the old moves, but some are slightly changed, maybe makes them more advanced than the old positions.I just think they should had re-recorded these 'ultimate' series, because u can see the people's outfits change every few minutes! that is why i give it 4 stars and not the 5."
5,This If that is A Latin Bomb!,"This girl is super talented, her voice is excellent, really not you because it doesn't get the success that point deserves, the best Track in the Cd is I believe in which this accompanied by DJ BOBO is excellent, Another very good one is you Quedate Conmigo which was the first single of this Cd, Angel is one of my favorite ones for my this Cd it is totally excellent."
3,"Good effort, but not enough.","Her last cd was a pop bouquet full of vigor, and heart. This is meaningless. Last things first. Why DJ Bobo? He tried to do an Irene Cara on her but it sucked. ""i believe"" should have had more vocals for her. If she wanted a good producers, Why not Mike Stock, Matt Aitken, or Delerium? Te quiero todo para mi is the only song that reminds one of the last CD. La Bomba sucked major ~!@#@!#. Quedate Conmigo is a pop slice of tango. Other than that not much. So get only if 1. You like Ballads or 2. you are a Patty Fan, See ya"
3,She's all over the place!!!,"I personally think this is not one of her better cds - she is all over the place exploring pop. La Bomba's ""reggae-ton"" does not work for her. I would not run to get it. Instead, get the one prior to this one, the one titled ""que el ritmo no pare"" or better yet, get the one that includes ""niña bonita."""
5,Banginess mixtape all hype cuts and a few exclusives!,this cd is hot from start to finish. I am a fan of the hiph hop honeys dvds but i didn't know they do mixtapes too! Shouts to DJ Strong for doing this one up big!
1,Too Commercial,I thought this cd was way to commercial. There is way too much advertising going on that you can't even enjoy the music.
4,Nice lotion,"A nice, thick, nongreasy lotion with very little scent. I got it to use on a new tat, and have used it all over. My only wish is that it had sunscreen to protect the color."
5,So easy to find this Great product,"I'd been looking all over for this filter in the stores. Finally got the idea to look online. Very pleased, item shipped quickly, and saved a lot of time by purchasing it here."
2,Not quite...,I don't think this filter is as good as the original that came with my dirt devil. The seal (or lack of) in the connection between the filter and the vacuum is not quite good enough.
3,Dirt Devil filter,This filter is what I needed although it's hard to clean and I think it costs more than it should.
3,"Beautiful Pictures, but little substance.","This book is a must for the fanatic Ewan admirer, if only for the umpteen absolutely gorgeous pictures of the star. However,the actual text, although interesting, seems little more than a compilation of previous Newspaper and Magazine articles. Although I did find several tidbits about the actor that I hadn't read elsewhere, I also found serveral quotes that I had read before, but were wrongfully reproduced here -- in other words, Ewan was being misquoted. So, in turn, I wasn't sure what to believe in the book. However, like I said, some of the b&w stills are breathtaking, and it's definitely a good bio of the actor (although I'm not sure how accurate!)"
1,not good,"If your expecting a documentary with the clarity and production value of ""End of the Century"" or ""Filth and the Fury"" THIS AIN'T IT! Picture taking 40 hours of bad home video (really awful sound) and editing together and calling it a documentary. No current interviews, No voice over making any sense of the chaos...No thought to flow or storyline, just a mishmash of stuff banged together. A real dissapointment. The saddest part is that for those fans out there who want it, this material could be a great source for a documentary with actual substance. I've liked the dolls for years and was really excited at the prospect of them getting their due. Its a shame this is what its been reduced to. Shame on everyone involved."
2,only for the INTENSE fan !!,"Insightful in the off stage lives of the boys. Kibbutzy narration is at times boring, other times hilarious. The youthful Dolls traveling, that is a strange circus indeed. Whereas Jerry and Johnny are normalized, Sylvain totally blows one critics statement threw the roof. The statement was, ""You don't think that the Dolls actually walk the streets in the daytime dressed that way, do you?"" Well, Sylvain did. Reminds me of my lost friend from Detroit, who lived for a time on cheap red wine and bagged popcorn. (he also worked at one of the porno stores in a seedy neighborhood). Totally unpolished New York Doll performances make you want to walk down the block, and catch some kids performance in a local driveway or garage."
4,Smells Great,This product was exactly what I ordered but kinda scared me as I recieved the package because the box seemed previously opened. I had to tell my friend I wanted to smell it so I was the one that opened it.
5,A cologne for men which isn't too musky or too sweet smelling,"I discovered Candies for men a few years ago through a friend. I enjoyed the fragrance which isn't too musky or too sweet smelling for me. One of the few colognes I dabbled on my neck daily.In past year or two, I couldn't find it anywhere. Luckily, Amazon has connections and saved me from some stinky scent for men elsewhere. Its an unique scent which can be used for men or women. I highly recommend the product!!!!"
5,Best of it's kind,"I have an older edition that my sister bought for me for christmas several years back. It's one of the few books i'll have for the rest of my life because of its incredible value as a comprehensive herb and plant info resource. The edition I have has pictures, names, references in the front with longer descriptions in the back in the same style as an audubon society field guide book. It's great for picking up and reading random stuff or to lookup the medicinal uses of a specific herb. The book never ceases to amaze me. Of all the herb books i've read, this one is time and again the most useful."
4,Herbs,I am taking a medicinal botany class and was not satisfied with the information the text book gave me and wanted to know more I saw this book and ordered it. I love it. It is a must have for someone interested in herbs even my instructor found it helpful.
4,Pleased,I was very pleased with this product. It didn't have to be a perfect book but it was very acceptable.
5,KINGSBURY - FORGIVEN,"Well written, enjoyable, sad, good solution's to some difficult situations. I think this would be a good book for the youth of today instead of the hateful, dark side, books they are reading."
5,Forgiven,Karen's books are FANTASTIC and very inspirational!!!! I feel lost if I don't have another one of her books to pick up after finishing reading one.
5,Worth the Wait,I was so anxious for the next book of the Firstborn Series and this was definitely worth the wait. Excellent book from beginning to end. Two thumbs up!
3,Disappointed,"I have to confess that I was disappointed in this book.It seemed to methat the story really did not go anywhere, it just went on and on. Theplay practices took up so much of the book and did not seem to me thatit had any bearing on the story. I was so sure the young drunk driverwas going to be taken under the wing of John Baxter. I kind of just scannedover parts of the book, I put it down many times and had to force myselfto finish it, It was a gift to me, so I did finish it, I also was givenFound, but I'm going to read something else before I start that. KarenKingsbury's Redemtion Series were books I could not put down. I wishthese were as good.."
5,Love Karen Kingsbury,Love all of Kingsbury books. I have given books to my friends and family and they also love her books. Sad I finished the serier though
3,Enjoyed the book very much.,I chose this book because I have been reading the entire series and have enjoyed the story of the entire family. Its very true to life.
4,"Like Zinc, Didn't Like Faster","First.I think Zinc is a good UK DJ. He is on the True Playaz label (DJ Hype's label), but has also started his own record label Bingo Beats.I appreciate the concept of the album - a album whose beats get faster and faster with each track until you get to the last track and it is (maybe) too fast.But, I didn't like the beats. Sorry. I like heavy, not just fast, beats.I don't even know if anyone will ever read this,but I would suggest you save your $35 and get another album by Zinc (that I know is good, like - BEATS BY DESIGN)There are only 7 tracks on the album, and I am not sure if each one is worth $5.Also, even though I thought the concept was interesting -- I own turntables and could re-create the same effect as the FASTER lp with my own records."
3,see parris and die,"received the book in a very short time. actually in time for vacation. book was somewhat anti-climantic in that i was in the marine corp, at parris island at the time of the writing. still enjoyed it."
5,BIRDMAN,"growing up i always enjoyed the hanna barbera super-heros and this is an excellent addition to my collection now if only someone would putSAMSON AND GOLIATH and the 1967 FANTASIC FOUR series onDVD[hint ,hint]"
5,Biiiiiirrrrrrrrrddddddd Man!,This package is great. Every episode of one of the great cartoon heroes of all time. Bring on the Herculoids!
4,"Sleek and elegant, but a little top-heavy.","I bought these chopsticks for my brother-in-law and his wife, who live in a very modern-style home. These chopsticks matched their decor well, but they require a bit more attention when eating, due to the weight at the top (while resting the chopsticks in your hand, they tend to fall back). They are also a little harder to maneuver due to the square-ness of the sticks in itself. Otherwise, they are very nice and well made."
2,Amco not Asian oriented.,"No Asian would buy this and to add, my grandmother would call me a disgrace if I even owned this. I'm a loyal Amco fan but I gotta admit, Amco should never go into Asian cookware, or tools.On the sidenote: it's a great present for those couples who wants their significant others to learn how to use a chopstick. Shows initiative. =)(I think the guy or girl who invented this probably made it for people beginning to learn how to use a chopstick cause there would be absolutely NO other reason for it. Grips on a chopstick?! Married a non-asian eh? ha ha... it's cool.)"
5,The BEST MOST HILARIOUS BOOK! RUN TO THE BOOKSTORE AND BUY THIS!!!!,"I'm not kidding. I am a book finatic, I read all types of books but this one takes the cake for the laughter, realness, honesty.. etc. I love Denise!!! I wanna know what Happened with Harold!"
3,Pretty Funny but Degrading (For the author),"I will admit that I found myself laughing really hard while reading this book (more-so in the beginning) however, at one point I stopped and expressed my concern (to my boyfriend) about the information that she decided to share. There were one too many stories about bad decisions, on her part, such as dating married men and not getting the point that someone is not interested in you. I began to think ""Goodness what is wrong with her"". On the other hand, I could not put the book down and finished reading it in a few hours."
3,This was hilarious!,"I Wish I Never Met YouDenise N. Wheatley 3 1/2 starsThis comical collection of dating mishaps is hilarious!The narrator, no name given takes you through her dating dilemma's with Doug the Heinous Dragon, Preston the Project Mishap, Ernest the Uncover Sugar Booty, Warren the so called Wonder..ect..At the end of each dating story she gives you tips labled Bottom Damn Line:on how to avoid the same disaster.We've all had a few dating dilemma's but this sisters stories are wild. Yours won't hold a candle to these. In her quest to find Mr. Right she definitely meets some jokers.My Bottom damn Line:This books was Bananas! straight up, no sugar coating. This nameless narrator was oustrageously funny. I enjoyed her mishaps. Glad they aren't mine.reviewed byDawn"
2,Alright...,"Everybody lost their minds over ""Tip Drill"" with the credit card scene, but they should be more offended this book. The whole book is full of stories with a woman going to the absolute extreme every time a man didn't act the way she wanted him to. The narrator was a golddigger, greedy, violent, vindictive and reminded me why men think women are so doggone crazy! The stories at the beginning were humorous (one story actually did happen to me, with the dude from the club who she bought the Bubblegum for--except mine was a WuTang t-shirt) but the ones at the end disgusted me. Burning down houses and urinating on people just isn't funny to me."
1,If quality attracted quality....,"You'd know what is wrong with this woman's dating life. I really didn't find it funny, I found it downright cruel."
3,Purchased it for the maintenance section which does the job,"Purchased it for the maintenance section which does the job. Other than that, its some rather rudimentary insight into shooting positions and patterning. However, I did find the maintenance section and a few other chapters useful."
4,Good Instructional Video For Beginners - Recommended,"""Mastering the AR-15"" is a good starting point for those new to the AR-15. The video includes good instructions for disassembly and cleaning, as well as decent sections on the proper operation of the AR-15. We found a lot of useful tips and tricks on the disc, ultimately saving us a lot of time and trouble down the road.Production quality is better than most of the free content found around the Internet, and it is convenient to have all the content on one DVD.Recommended!CFH"
5,One of the best Korean films ever made,"I felt full and complete after watching this movie like I had a fantastic meal or read a great novel. Foreign films such as Failan, without big Hollywood budget, relies totally on the talents of the director and actors for their creativity. I wish there are wider reviews and distribution of foreign films in America. I found about this movie recently by a word of mouth."
5,Great Movie!,"Well, I realize there was a lot of good reviews and bad reviews. I guess this is a type of movie that would depend on the type of person you are. If you really enjoy watching movies about the hardship and reality of life then this would be a great movie for you. It shows that life can never be the way you plan it to be and things can often go wrong. It is a very sad movie and I am surprise I had so much sorrow for these two actors.But if you like action movies a lot more than this might not be the movie for you because it's more focus on real life situations that goes on around the world.I thought it was great...and Cecilia always knows how to play her roles well. =)"
4,Failan is Ceciia Cheung's name in the movie...,"alright, here's the synopsis of this romance/somewat action/comedy movie.This korean guy(he's abot40 mid40) is a petty gangster that owns a arcade. and one day he receives a letter from our cute Failan(cecilia Cheung). what happened is that she got married to him without him knowin it....must see for girls...i duno if guys will like it, personally im more of ' young & dangerous' "" a bettr tomorrow' ' BEAT' type of guy...but this movie was 'cute'o and the korean guy and Cecilia Cheung never see each other in the movie..."
4,7 members?,"i got this cd for like 7 or 8 dollars at a used cd shop and its worth more than that.the thing that really stands out on this cd is its originality-it doesnt sound like any other band at all.at times it sounds a bit thrashy.plus maniac and killjoy singing together.awsome!the lyrics are cool but the song written by faust stands out quite a bit.if youre one of those people who only like the nbm classics like in the nightside eclipse,de mysterrious or trassylvanian hunger you wont like this but if youre willing to venture off give them at lest a listen"
2,Handle breaks under weight of ingredients,"I can't recommend these measuring cups. The handles aren't very strongly attached; shortly after I purchased a set, I was holding the one-cup measuring cup by the handle while it was full of flour, and the cup snapped off and fell to the floor."
1,"Wow, these are TERRIBLE QUALITY","I was concerned when I bought these and saw that the handles and cups are two separate pieces (it's just something that can break). Well, they broke. I was drying off the 1-cup today and the handle just fell off... I wasn't even applying any force. They have never even been in a dishwasher. What a piece of junk. I bought them because they are recommended by Alton Brown -- but now I'm going to look for something that is better quality. AVOID THESE, THEY WILL BREAK."
1,Could be better if they were accurate,"These would be great if they were marked correctly. In my set, the 1 cup measuring cup is inscribed with the legend ""1/3 cup"". Nice quality control, guys. If you are looking for precision, look elsewhere."
1,"Flimsy and Horrible, Waste of Money","If I could give these no stars I would. I have owned them for ONE month and used them MAYBE 6 times, and the 1/2 cup measuring cup already broke. The handles are glued (not even welded) on. I was measuring out shredded cheese today and the handle just snapped off. Cheese isn't exactly a heavy material and it couldn't even stand up to that? I am very irritated and feel like I completely wasted my money!"
2,"As with others, handles break off","The cup portion of these measuring cups is fine. However, as several others have pointed out, the spot welds on the handles are horrible. For the 1-cup, lasted about 6 months. I expect this could be extended if you don't put them in the dishwasher -- but what's the point? (I'll hand-wash pots and expensive knives, but measuring cups don't get cut that kind of slack.)"
2,cups are two pieces,When I received these I was disappointed to find out each cup is not one piece. The handle is separated from the cup part. I am concerned this may be hard to clean.
1,Poor Quality,"These are poorly made, they seem to be made of a very cheap stainless steel, and there are marks on each of the cups and handles which make them look like they've been used."
3,sturdy cups,"I bought this as a top reccomendation of Cook's Illustrated. I don't like the little spouts, they confuse me as to how to get an accurate measurement and also they scratch things. My bundt pan I ordered at the same time was scratched from the spout. The price was good."
3,Not a very heavy gauge stainless steel,"Slightly disappointed in the quality of this measuring cup set. First the weight/gauge is less than what I expected and the handles are ""spot welded"" to the cups and feel flimsy. I've washed several times and am beginning to see rust spots. On the positive side, the shape of the cup and the length of the handle is such that you can easily scoop your ingredients out of bags or canisters."
4,Amco measuring cups,"I purchased these Amco stainless steel measuring cups directly from Amazon a few weeks ago, and I am glad I did. Since losing all of my stuff sometime ago, I have had to start all over again. I am grateful for a site like Amazon where the selections are always plentiful and the prices awesome. My motivation for purchasing this particular item, first, the quality of the stainless steel, second, the design incorporating pour spouts to prevent splatter, and of course the price point. Always a great selection, I recommend this product to anyone who needs this item but have limited resources with which to purchase."
4,measuring cups,"I ordered these because I used to have plastic ones that lasted about a month, 2 broke. So i decided to go with some stainless steel ones. So far I like them, they feel a bit cheap but work out just fine."
5,measuring cups,"These are probably the best measuring cups I've owned. I bought a set of plastic cups a couple of years ago and it was hardly anytime before the sizes began to wear off, even with hand washing. I had had a metal set of cups some time ago but they got separated and eventually were lost. These are much better than those were. The handles are very sturdy."
5,It makes me wish I'd seen the stage production.,"I was completely mesmorized by this production. It had my undivided attention from start to finish. My first introduction to Eugene O'Neill was when I saw A Long Days Journey in the late 70's with Deborah Kerr. It was a play I have never forgotten. If I had one wish after watching A Moon for the Misbegotten on film it would be to turn back the time 25 years so I could see Colleen Dewhurst as Josie in person. O'Neill's plays have an all male cast with the exception of one very strong female role. It took a strong yet amiable personality to play Josie, and Colleen Dewhurst was just the actress to capture the attention of an entire audience while not upstaging the other actors. If you love Colleen Dewhurst, Jason Robards, Eugene O'Neill, or the theatre in general, this is one performance not to be missed."
3,Surprising,"Unrpredictable, ad-lib live recording. A few selections are easy to enjoy some are too ""free jazz""."
1,Cheaply Made,"Don't buy this, the glass portion will not even stand in the holder. Very cheaply made."
5,A great Bowl!,"I love this bowl! There is nothing like stainless steel for versatility, you can use this for anything!"
5,"Great deal, nice bowl, sturdy construction","While I wasn't willing to plunk down $80 for an overpriced All-Clad mixing bowl, I was looking for a stronger than usual, commercial-style mixing bowl, sturdier than what is typically sold at say, Target or Bed Bath & Beyond.This mixing bowl is easy on the wallet, and is a strong little number as well. The steel is definitely quality, and fairly thick, and the bottom is also flat for a better grip on one's countertop. I also purchased the smaller 2-quart bowl as well, and the bottom of that is sheathed in an attractive blue rubber, that also enhances traction on countertops.My only gripe is that now I need to buy the 6 quart as well, for larger jobs such as cake batter or salads. Really a nice set. But, I'd say save yourself some money and get the bowls individually, rather than the set of 3 bowls for $49.99 that Amazon is also offering."
5,All the Amco mixing bowls are top notch,"Great value for such a fine product, as all the Amco mixing bowls are the highest quality, and it's the perfect shape. Sturdy with a half-inch lip makes it easy to hold onto and can be used for anything. I doubled up on the 4- and 6-qt. sizes.______________However, if you're measuring, this bowl holds only 3-quarts of liquid volume; which converts to about 2.58-quarts of dry volume. (The kitchen industry is riddled with these measuring inaccuracies.) If you need accurate liquid volumes for mixing bowls, buy the Tovolo, Roscan, or Cook Pro brands."
3,Dry,This book just seems like an overview of PID Control. I have found it hard to stay interested in the text.
2,"Mine didn't exactly leak, but...","...I finally got rid of it, since the cheesy ""anti-drip"" tip on the spout didn't work, and I always ended up with a greasy spot on my stone countertops. Poor value for the $$"
4,Great Addition to the Kitchen,"The Amco Italian Oil Can is great! It makes a perfect addition to the dinner table. My guests and I absolutely adore it's shape and concept. Also, it compliments any kitchen decor when not in use."
3,silent eloquence in photos of a hard life,"very well edited and prepared. The photos say a lot. I thought there might be a bit more text, but that is probably for another Colin Escott book and I plan to buy it as well"
1,You can't get audio CD,"It does not have audio CDSo, you can't practice Listening Part of this bookYou can purchase the CD at the Pearson Education website, paying about $90.It's really dirty and tricky. -_-;;"
4,Nice design but could be bigger,"Well made, good design, but for a large strainer, it could be bigger. I like the fact that it has two pieces at the end that hold the pan."
3,corny but informative,"This video is embarrassing to watch with anyone else in the room. However, it is informative and thorough despite the idiotic way the host presents himself in the previews for his other productions."
1,Looking for a great adventure movie?,"Then don't bother with this one. Cheap, cheezy special effects, pitifully predictable plot line, shallow characters. Made in 2008 so you'd think they could do a better job with the effects than the cartoon like scenes we watched. Nope, I'd give this one zero stars if it would let me."
2,WHO MOVED THE CANYON?,"IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS THIS MOVIE WAS NOT FILMED ANYWHERE NEAR THE GRAND CANYON. BUT EVEN THE ACTUAL LOCATION COULD REALLY SAVE THIS TEPID/DERIVATIVE MESS.HISTORICALLY INCORRECT, SOMNAMBULENT PERFORMANCES, CHEESY CGI MONSTER, LAZY DIRECTION AND STUPID PLOTTING ONLY ADD UP TO A PRETTY BAD MOVIE. SHANN9ON DOHERTY AND MICHAEL SHANKS LOOK EMBARRASSED."
4,The Lost Treasure of the Grand Canyon blu-ray,This movie was very entertaining. It had some good special effects. You will like it if you are a Shannen Doherty fan.
3,A Little Of This & A Little Of That,"Joe Cocker for the ""Smooth Jazz"" generation. ""She Believes In Me"" written by Bryan Adams and Eliot Kennedy with backing vocals by Bryan leads the way. I bought this CD for that song alone. That song and ""Lie To Me"" makes the purchase a worthwhile one. However I would have liked to have seen Ol' Joe cut loose as he does on the latter cut, more often than he does."
3,Good Joe....but...,I'm an avid Joe fan and I enjoyed most of the tunes on the CD and but I wish he would lose the strings and bring back the horn section. Something about a string section with that voice that just doesn't do it. It cries for a couple of trumpets and a saxophone.
2,It's sad...,"It's sad to see a great talent like Joe Cocker go to waste on easy listening drivel like this. The voice is still there, but until he finds some decent material and hires a real band, don't bother."
2,I have not changed my mind?,"I reviewed this latest Joe Cocker release several months ago[see import version], and I still have not changed my opinion or rating. The problem with online cd reviews is hardcore fans refuse to rate a product honestly. I am as big a Joe Cocker fan as you can find, but but I am not about to award this cd 5 stars and give it some sort of classic status like some prior reviews have? This cd is lightweight fluff compared to his more energized releases like ""Unchain My Heart"", ""One Night Of Sin"",""Organic"" or any of his late 60's or early 70's output. I have every Joe Cocker album ever made and ""No Ordinary World"" is without question one of his weakest releases in a recording career that spans over 30 years. I look forward to a little more gusto with his next release."
3,Slow Burn,I expected more pictures of Centralia. A page with a picture and a page with a few sentences from residents just didn't cut it with me.
4,Brings Back Memories,"This book is very well done, and I feel uniquely qualified to review this, because I grew up in Centralia. The photos are very good and the documentation is as accurate as is possible with all the conveluded information that is ""The Centralia Mine Fire"", I would recommend this to anyone who wants more info on the fire."
2,Practical Jaguar Ownership,"It may be a good book if you're dealing with VERY old jaguars, but it's almost useless if you have a Jaguar of less than 30 years old. It contains good advice regarding maintenance of leather and wood interiors. It did not said too much about the XJ-S, a model that definetly will be a classic and is a wonderful piece of machine."
2,Is not a book for mechanics,"This book focused on older jaguar models from 1940 to 1975. It is mainly a collection of personal stories of the author and his cars. It talks a little about interior restoration and jaguar automobilia for the collector enthusiast. However, it lacks any value regarding mechanical matters such as engine, brakes or general maintenance details."
3,18 Bronzemen III coming soon!,This is definitely no way to prepare for another sequel! This film would have got five stars but for the fact that the ending was very poor.There were plots left undecided and business left unfinished.So many questions left unanswered!I'd still advise real martial arts fans to see the film simply hoping that there will indeed be a third part to conclude this saga.
5,Maturity,"After hearing this CD four or five times I was hooked. There are a few classic sounding songs on this one, but they've also took a new direction on this one; a direction I think fits really well. There are a lot of big chorus' on this CD; the vocals are exceptional. The studio sound they captured is excellent. Overall this is a great effort by Sevendust."
1,Nothing !,i took this product for diabetes and to me it was like taking nothing because it did nothing for me .
1,Seattles Loch Mess,"Corny acting. Silly plot deviations showing the human side of the monster search (your wives yell at you a lot.)Production suffers when you can't hear what is being said one second, then it's too loud. Overbearingly loud music.Not even worthy of the title mockumentary. The Indian connection was pretty much contrived, and themonster itself a standard Plesiosaur that travels to and fro the ocean via secret tunnels. Check out ""Incident at Loch Ness"" if youwant to be entertained by a Lake Monster. That movie is hilarious. This is garbage."
1,Bad Movie,"Can't believe how some say this is well done. Must be the producers of the show. Just rented the movie. Poorly put together. Would have&#65279; been better if straight true documentary. Acting and scripting as bad as Billy Jack movies. Makes mockery of such a creature if one exists. Wait, maybe that's the way the movie is suppose to be, all of the above...oh, I get it...Witch Blair Project!"
1,"90% Advertizement, 10%Marines","I recommend the VHS version. I jumped at the opportunity to have the silent drill team on DVD. Unfortunately, the DVD recording has the same quality as a VHS tape as well as pour sound. The aftermath is a prolonged ad. I was in the Marines and this DVD recording lacks attention to detail, except for the Marines in it. It has three minute references to becoming better target shooters for competition shooters, to make the sale ads. I felt I lost an hour of my life watching the advertizement on this DVD, then I took it outside and shot it!!!"
1,YouTube is better!!,"I gave it one STAR just to get this published otherwise it would get Zip. Very disappointed to get a DVD that was shot with a home recorder. The disc started with a few minutes of film obviously taken off a TV screen, very fuzzy and washed out. My heart sank when I remembered what I paid for this junk. Then the image improved for the taping of the Color Guard and the Silent Drill Team performances. Not too bad with some close and wide angle shots. The cameraman didn't always zoom in on what I wanted to see but it did break up the shooting.The whole scene is a concrete or blacktop drill field with stadium bleachers, don't expect to see a beautiful and historic background like Arlington or DC.I'm not kidding, what I found on YouTube was mostly better. TOO EXPENSIVE!!U.S. Marine Corps Battle Color Ceremony Featuring The Silent Drill Team DVD"
5,US Marine Corp Drill Team DVD,The DVD is better then a 5. If there is anyone who has been a marine or on the drill team this is great for their friends and family to see what they were involved in.
5,"Bravo-Great drama, humorous, believable, and touching.","It's difficult to get me to sit in one place, yet read a novel. I literally could not put ""A Song For The Asking"" down until it was finished. I was raised in the area where the story takes place, and found Mr. Gannon's writing so accurate that I felt I was in the plot. This is not your typical formula story but rather a gripping account of a family's life that will have you begging for more at the end of the last page. Steve Gannon is not a writer you will soon forget. More please!!"
5,Song,This was the first book that I read from the mind of Steve Gannon. I was sucked in by the first chapter and just couldn't put the book down. It almost ruined my marriage!! His characters are so real and human that I felt that I knew them from somewhere in my life. Perhaps I did! Great book --Steve Gannon. Keep writing.
4,Violence mixed with a heartfelt storyline,"Truly believable characters, it wasn't long before I was identifying with this family. The only problem I had with this story was the unexpected violence and the depth of that violence. I found myself skipping entire chapters, yet it had no effect on me being able to follow the saga of this family-- a good compromise. As a result, the book was a very quick read, and yet touched me deeply. I'm looking forward to seeing the next book by Mr. Gannon."
1,Boring repeative story,"How many times can you demonstrate what an ass the main character is? Over and over and over with no real story going on and totally boring characters. The big event that happens to 2 of the characters is so underwritten and totally unbelievable. Terrible book, I skipped a lot of pages and didn't miss anything."
4,tracy talks vintage,"This book is great fun and so colorful! Rather reminds me of the times she is covering. Although she touches on the early post war years, the book's focus is on the 60's through the 90's. There are wonderful photos and illustrations and great text. She covers everything in fashion from clothing to jewelry, shoes and purses; the book is really a complete history of modern fashion. In that sense, it becomes a ""what to look for and how to find authentic pieces"" guide. The source list is worth the price of admission. I learned some things and am happy to have this in my collection."
1,"Eye Candy for the Super Rich,, and Shallow to Boot","This book starts only at around 1940 and just gives a few glossy pictures for each decade. Models and model-lovers should love it, but it's really more about the culture of buying couture and outrageously priced clothing than it is about vintage. A big ho-hum, and a little bit of a ripoff for the money. Shallow, shallow, shallow."
1,Not good unless you're collecting for a museum.,"Snobby tome that all but ignores giving advice on how to find quality, fit or style, but demands that you look for only museum-quality Balienciaga or Chanel couture that the average shopper could never possibly afford, much less wear. The photographs are very nice, especially the cover art, but I'm skeptical about any ""Vintage Expert"" book that describes the obviously flapper-inspired cover photograph as evocative of the 1880's - a serious gap of 40 years. You'd really think they'd know better. Save your money and put it to better use at your favorite local vintage shop or textile museum. Or both."
5,fine vintage,This is not a book for grungy secondhand roses raking around the fleamarkets for funky bargain clothes but for the serious connoisseur of fine vintage this book is indispensable.
4,Spanish-English Dictionary,"Although a little bulky at 2"" thick, this book is one of the best dual language dictionaries I've delt with. Great shelf resource, but you don't want to have to carry it around!"
4,Spanish Vocabulary Builder,Lots of words. Easy to read. Excellent pronunciation guide. Way too big for any normal pocket.
4,A good book about a great plane.,"Comes very close to covering everything about the F-4, from development, variations and deployment. It covers foreign users as well. The spey engined version gets a fair amount of coverage in terms of its development but comparitively little on its deployment. Some coverage of the isreali deployment and use but little about the range of modifications done while in isreali service. Other foreign users only gets a brief mention."
5,Touches my heart,"Roseanne's velvet voice and honest lyrics really touch my heart. This CD is easy on the ears and lifts the spirit. I have been searching for ages for a female vocalist that expresses what is in my heart, that sings the songs that speak my mind. All the selections are very well done, and it would be hard to choose just one as a favorite. I get a kick out of ""My Baby Thinks He's a Train"" and the versatility of her voice as she emulates the rhythms and sounds associated with trains. ""Never Be You"" is strong vocally and speaks to that lost love we all have known. ""Seven Year Ache"" is a song with no equal... it just draws you in. ""What We Really Want"" ... is love... so true. I really like ""No Memories Hangin' Round"" with Bobby Bare - they are so good together. The guitar work and instruments are all excellent. You can't go wrong with this CD."
5,gotta love roseanne,I heard Roseanne interview on NPR Terry Gross and fell in love with her and now her music. She is truly a warm person and soothing voice to listen to. I especially love that she has duet with other favorite artists! you go girl!
2,A little disappointed,"I received my earrings on time-they were one of many that I ordered. I sent them back for a replacement-one was almost clear, the other had a little bluish tint. I've ordered blue topaz earrings from them before-so maybe this was just a bad batch or the checker didn't match them well."
4,Excellent introductory book,"""The Death Penalty : A Debate"" is an excellent introduction to the topic for two primary reasons. First, it presents the two main opposing view points argued well by experts on the subject, so regardless of your own position you need not fear that the book is biased. Second, it covers the subject thoroughly, addressing each issue individually, and relying on facts to support claims. This means, after reading this book, you'll have plenty of ammunition the next time you want to argue the subject with someone esle."
4,Working honeymoon in Ireland,"""Laced"" is a fun few hours of light reading in the Regan Reilly series. Regan and Jack are on their honeymoon in Ireland but you know that crimes and mysteries surround them wherever they go! So when a handmade lace tablecloth is stolen from the castle/hotel where they are staying, you know they have to catch the culprits. Follow them as they investigate the crime all over the Galway area on the west coast of Ireland, and sit back for a fun adventure that also includes ""ghosts"", scam artists, and dental mishaps."
3,Satisfactory mystery adventure...,"This is the first book of the Regan Reilly series that I have read, and I will probably be enjoying more of these stories in the future. I was looking for something light and humorous with a bit of danger and mystery, and this book was it. The mystery wasn't so much a mystery as it was a chase really, but it was still a good story. I really like Jack and Regan's relationship; they solve crimes together and still manage to have a good time as well. I might start back at the beginning of this series when they were just dating to see how their relationship progressed over the years.The story was good, like I said, but I would have enjoyed maybe a murder or two instead of just a few things being stolen...the ghost kind of made up for that part in a way, but there's nothing like a good old-fashioned murder mystery. Anyway, pick this up if you are looking for the same easy reading you get from Carol's mother, but expect a little more humor and adventure."
5,Mystery set in Ireland,"This was a good little book, and the setting in Ireland was nice. It was fun to read about the Irish characters entwined in a mystery. I enjoy Carol Higgins Clark books."
3,Tablecloth mystery,"A mystery without a murder is a fun read, but Carol Higgins Clark needs to work on the character of Jack Reilly. He just doesn't come into the story as well as the other characters.Margaret Raftery and Felicity Buckley put the spice in the ghost caper and lift the story out of the mundane. Regan and Jack Reilly have a work filled honeymoon as thieves invade their haunted retreat. But all the pieces of the little subplots come together like the threads of the prized tablecloth.Just the book to take to the dentist office.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,Not bad,I read this book in 1 day. It's a fast and easy read! I did enjoy it; but I wish they would develop the character of Jack more and make him seem more like he is part of the team. I loved the fact that he and Regan got to work together more but if my parents showed up on my honeymoon....ARGH!
4,Love the details on Ireland,Typical Regan Reily series book. The detail did give a good visual of Ireland.
4,quick and fun read,I really liked this book. It is a good light mystery.I picked it up and didn't realize it was written by Carol rather than Mary. I will look for more books written by her.
1,Nancy Drew Marries One Of the Hardy Boys,"Another cookie cutter script. Easy read if you have to be mindless, like commuting to and from destinations."
4,"Decent, but not the best in the series","I love this series and the fact that unlike the books by her mother all the books by Carol Higgins Clark follow the characters through their lifetime. Laced was a fun, quick read. Excellent choice for a day on the beach, or a plane ride. Wasn't my favorite out of her series."
3,Irish humour,"Husband and wife team of investigators, Regan and Jack Reilly are newly weds, spending their honeymoon at an historic hotel in Ireland when some characters from their past seem determined to make a shambles of their holiday by carrying out another robbery right under their noses. It's a pleasant tale with engaging characters which I would recommend as a one day read in between heavier works."
3,Fun Read,"This one is a lot better than the last Regan Reilly mystery, although our sleuth's new hubby Jack Reilly still seems badly under-developed,inept and unconvincing as the head of the NYC major crime squad...What saves Laced is the Irish folklore woven through the storyline and the colorful characters. A fast, fun read."
4,Positive Advice,"Instead of telling you what you can't eat, Elaine Magee tells you what you can eat. There is great advice on managing blood sugar levels, as well as, advice for general well being. Aside from positive advice about nutrition, Ms. Magee also explains what is happening to your body when you have type II diabetes. A well rounded guide that gives you simple, practical things which help you cope with the symptoms."
1,Is this Homer Simpson's version of diabetic advice?,"I was absolutely shocked when I read this! I threw it in the garbage!I don't know what kind of diet she has looked at for diabetics but mine doesn't include cafe mocha with chocolate syrup,or cookies with white sugar,brown sugar,and syrup, or donuts!If I followed this book I have no idea what would happen to my blood sugar!my diet does not incorporate the things she says one can eat with diabetes,like 2 big slices of pizza at a meal! Come on now -get real!Ice cream bars? cookies?pizza?donuts?If you want to lower your blood sugar and get off meds forget this book!"
3,Cyberchase Carnival Chaos,"As an avid fan of the show, I HAD to have this game, and now that I have it, I'm not sure what I think of it. It's kind of hard (I can only do two games on it), but, on the other hand, it's a lot of fun to see the charaters from my favorite show on here. (Especially Buzz and Delete- I really like them.) So, I think a die-hard fan should look into it, but be prepared: it's not as easy as it looks."
3,20 gal hose end sprayer,"Works really good, The only problem I have is you must remove the the top in order to attach the hose since it is one solid piece."
4,Its a Book.,"I received it tightly wrapped in cardboard in good condition.The box was a bit banged up so I had to question the handling quality, but overlooked it as the book was in excellent quality.No smashed or wrinkled pages, everything was in order."
5,One of those rare books...,"There a few books that conjure a simultaneously bizarre reaction within a soul: like a biblical epiphany, Dagget stirs new paradigms that made me so excited that I could barely put down the book to complete my daily tasks. Yet, I could not turn the page to the next chapter because the elegant revelations of our place in nature evoked so much thought and ""wow"", that muddying the gift of a previous chapter with another would do it no justice.Tom Bean's photography is enlightening and beautiful; a great match for a great book. Environmentalists take heed--if you think we don't belong here, you'll find that you are more alien than those who put their soul's work into the land.This book is in my life's top ten list!Rev. D.M. North Dakota"
2,Load Handler Cargo Unloader,"This product claims to be able to unload up to 3000 lb. of almost any type of material one would usually carry in the bed of a pickup truck. For many light loads such as 500-600 lbs. of fireplace sized logs, this product worked very well. However, when I tried to unload about one ton (2000 lb.) of fill dirt from my pickup, the product was unable to handle it. I had to shovel some of the dirt out before the load handler was able to remove the rest. And, this was with a plastic liner beneath the load handler's fabric to reduce friction. In conclusion, I like this product for moving light loads, but am very disappointed that it can not handle nearly the amount claimed."
3,Caution when using!,"Used this product several times to unload leaves and cut grass. Recently I needed it to unload 2700lbs. of top soil. The bar was bowing but manufacturer claims 3000lbs, so I kept cranking with difficulty. Should have known better, tail gate bracket broke in half firing it like a canon ball just missing my head. So stick to light loads and be careful at full capacity, what ever that weight is."
5,worked as described,I used a tarp under the roller mat and put a half ton of compost right where I wanted it. The thing works just as described.
4,"good, but with limits","I was skeptical, but thought I would try the ""Unloader"". The unloader worked almost as promised. First trip to the Quarry was a 3000 pound load of stone, I did have to shovel off some (500 pounds) to get the ""Unloader"" to work. But on my second trip to the quarry- only picked up 2200 pounds, and the ""Unloader"" worked just as promised. In defense of the product- the plastic bed liner (reccomended by manufacturer) in my pickup is worn and has some rough spots. Probably with a bed liner in better condition, the ""Unloader"" would have worked fine. Easy to install and remove from truck. Saved alot of time for unloading stone."
5,"Clear, Precise and Useful","Before reading this book, I didn't know anything about exposure. The author clearly explains what is the relationship between shutter-speed, aperture and film speed. Moreover, he teaches how to use these three parameters to shoot creative photographs. The end of the book is related to special techniques (e.g. panning) or situations (e.g. shooting at night).For every concept, the author shows one or more photos thus, it is very easy to understand what he means.Great book !"
5,This is one book on photography that you can't do without.,"I think all of Bryan Peterson books are the best, if you care about taking better pictures. Buy them all."
2,Not his best book,"Although I admire Bryan Peterson's books, I would not count this as amoung his best. It is a compilation of articles that one can find in other books of his but it doesn't really give you a thorough basis in the topic of exposure."
5,Should be the first book read by aspiring photographers.,"Of the zillion books on photography available, Peterson's was the only one I've read that addressed the craft of photography to my satifisfaction. He doesn't go over the head of the novice nor does he speak down to the beginner. The three technical properties of exposure are discussed in easy to understand terms. Another characteristic I appreciated is that all photos carried reference to film type, shutter speed, and aperture. If I had found ""Understanding Exposure"" first I could have bypassed a couple dozen books and be a little ahead of the curve for amatuers."
5,I love this book,I am so excited about this book. I am new to photography and this book makes it easy to understand and fun to learn. I am excited about getting back my first roll of film to see how my pictures came out using these easy to follow techinques given by Bryan Peterson. I think this is a fabulous book for beginners!
2,very basic.,i would recommend this book for beginners in photography. i would not recommend this for those who already well versed in photography since there is nothing new here. and most of the topics refer to film photography which is already irrelevant nowadays. the book only shows one huge photo on one topic then the author discusses a lot of topics but is not backed up by sample photographs of what he is writing about.
5,I love this book!,"This book is excellent! I am new to the world of SLR cameras and this book has helped me to understand metering better than I ever thought I could.I had a question about something in the book and I found Bryan Peterson on the Internet and e-mailed him. He got back to me within 24 hours with an answer! I was impressed.It's a great book--easy to read and very helpful. The only drawback for me was that he is using a fully manual camera and it took a while for me to figure out what he was talking about when he said, ""I turned the dial until the correct shutter speed was indicated"". This is what I wrote him about and he explained to me that with a manual camera, you choose your aperture (or shutter speed) and then turn a dial to find the correct corresponding shutter speed (or aperture). With my camera, if I choose the aperture, the correct shutter speed is automatically displayed for me. I don't have to turn a dial to find it.Get this book! You need it, lol!"
5,Must have for amateur photographers!,"Book is great for amateur photographers. It is loaded with photos and author diligently describes how each of the photos were taken (aperture, shutter speed, filters, lens....). If you want to improve your skills, this book will help you a lot. 144 pages, written in a reader friendly manner, tell you about the essence of photography - exposure. It's not only a technical manual but also a guide to greative approach to photography. Very useful and pleasant reading.Enjoy!"
5,Great explanation on photography,"Peterson, with his teaching experience, explains in a very understandable vocabulary, what is really important in photography.I change completly my understanding of camera and photography and learned how to experiment."
5,Best book for beginner,"Bryan Peterson did a wonderful job explaining basics of photography such as F-stops, shutter speed, depth of field, etc. in a very easy to understand way, and there are many great pictures to illustrate how to achieve success by using simple techniques introduced in the book. A Must Read for beginners."
3,"helpful, but not overwhelmingly so","A good book for beginners or intermediate photographers. Really no new or radical information - just solid info that can be gleaned from any one of hundreds of sources. Nicely illustrated, though."
1,What a disappointment!,"After reading all the 5 star reviews of this book, I ordered the book. I was dismayed at the waste of pages containing the authors personal photos with little or no exposure information given. Peterson goes into a very mild discussion of exposure in the first few pages. The balance of the book is about other aspects of photography. Very little is actually devoted to exposure technique. He barely mentions exposure meters and assumes everyone has a 35mm camera with a built in meter. HA!! Avoid this book."
2,Not the Digital Version,"I actually ordered this book twice. The first time it never came - lost in delivery. It was like pulling teeth to get a refund from the third party shop Amazon went through.Anyway the main thing is this is a fine book full of great advice for film photographers (digital was really not even in existence much then in early 90's).There's another book by the same author, same title that is the revised edition - Amazon: why not a link to this book to help out your readers??!! This is the version you'll want in any case. Suppose Amazon just helping their vendors clean out their warehouses."
2,This book doesn't deliver,"It's more a photography primer, and less an in-depth discussion of exposure. Sure, shutter speed, aperature and film speed are discussed. But the reader will not learn how to use a camera's meter to select a *proper* exposure for a scene.There are numerous examples of exposures, like 1/125 at f/2.8, but there is never a link between the camera's suggested reading, and the final exposure values selected (hint: they're not always the same). A book with this title owes it to the reader to go the extra step - and more.John Shaw's 'Nature Photography' has an excellent chapter or two on exposure - I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to get their head around the concenpt."
5,Just take a chance,"I recently purchased and have read about 90% of this book. It's very helpful in explaining the exposure triangle as Peterson describes it, as well as depth-of-field including when to use it, how to use it, and how to compensate for it.Some of the most important advice that Peterson gives is to take some chances with your photographs by trying different techniques and types of film. He also notes that even the best photographers end up with two or three great photos out of a roll of film. This makes me feel a little better that most of the photos I take aren't fit for lining the bird-cage. It should also help keep things in perspective.I'm looking forward to finding the time to attempt some of the techniques described in the book. There's nothing in it specific to Digital Photography, if that's your area of interest, but if you choose to shoot with film, this book will be invaluable."
5,The Best Book about Exposure,This is the best book I have read about exposure. It is so easy to understand that I have began to shoot pictures setting my camera on manual mode for both the aperture and shooter speed. This book is a must have for anyone who is serious about photography.
3,"A good, but flawed book","Peterson does a good job of explaining exposure basics to the beginner and answering the questions that most beginners have (i.e. when to use a fast shutter speed or large aperture), but does not get much deeper than that.I also have a major gripe with this book because of an error that is sure to confuse some beginners. Peterson consistently writes about ""increasing"" shutter speed from (for example) 1/15th to 1/8th to 1/4th. When you go from a shutter speed of 1/15th of a second to 1/4th of a second, you may be increasing your exposure, but you're decreasing your shutter speed. No doubt someone has read this and been a bit confused by it.That gripe aside, this is still a pretty good book that covers the basics and should put beginning photographers at ease. Probably a good book for all beginners to look at."
3,solid reference guide for the impatient,"if you're either 1--non-tech inclined, or 2--just want the ""quick route"", then this is the book for you!otherwise, like me who's 1--wanting to study photography more seriously, or 2--more tech inclined, than there's far better books to study from on the art & science of photography."
2,"Very basic photography information, presented poorly","If you need to understand aperture, shutter speed, film speed and their relationships, this is a good book. Of course these are some of the most important aspects of photography, but if you are looking for more as I was, this book was disappointing.I wasn't terribly impressed with the photos. And I was terribly unimpressed with the writing, editing, and even grammar in several cases. Finally, the book is a little dated at this point. I bought Freeman Patterson's Photography and the Art of Seeing and found it much, much, much better for me."
1,not worth it,"I didn't care for the graphics in this game, even though I had high hopes for a game that would run both on my Palm tungsten E2 and my PC. But I find it distracting if I can't clearly make out the pieces or see the position on the board, and this failed in that area on both platforms. Luckily I didn't spend too much. I much prefer Fritz or Pawn on the PC, Chess Tiger on the Palm."
1,Not even worth a look,"Poor graphics, few features, limited playing styles, nothing to really recommend this title at all. Don't waste your time. Buy ChessMaster for $20 and forget this one exists."
1,Kasparov Chessmate?,"I have never played Kasparov chessmate but after readingthe reviews dont think I will be purchasing it.But if your really interested in learning chess and improving your game there is one I can recommend! CHESSMASTER9000Great PC chess program! Too much to list!Its money well spent!I have improved my game and on my way to becoming a High rated player! The sky's the Limit! Before chessmaster I used other programs but nothing can compare to Chessmaster9000!Just my opinion,..."
1,Get Serious,"Garry must be desperate to allow his name to be attached to this product. There are half a dozen free programs that do what Chessmate does, several in the price range that are superior (e.g. Majestic Chess), and many that, for a bit more, can really play chess (Fritz 8; Rebel 12; Chessmaster 9000). These last 3 also have didactic funtions that are greatly superior to those of Chessmate. If you want to beat up a computer program, Fritz and company can be suitably lobotomized with a little fiddling; if you want to get serious about chess, Kasparov Chessmate is not the way to go."
2,sugar coated,"The best account of Pat Tillman can be learned from his family and friends in ""The Tillman Story"" not in the biography channel presentation."
4,I've got things to do with my life is a great book about a great man.,"I've got things to do with my life is a great book. Well written with attention to detail. My only complaint is that it is somewhat inaccurate with some of the more recent details about Cpl. Pat Tillmans death that have come to light. A great book, though. Especially for young men searching for a great role model."
3,TrickStyle... ugh...,"The Dreamcast version is way much better than the PC version-- I got the PC version because I was expecting the very same soundtrack used from the Dreamcast port... but no... the DC version proved itself more worthy as a gamer's buy than the PC-- the songs don't even play, which I doubt there even IS any music to play in the background-- just the race, and when you're flying around in hoverboards, pulling insanely awesome tricks and the like; damnit I expect there to be some kind of psygoa-trance/breakbeat/techno going on as my BGM... a major let down-- don't buy this unless you're going for the Dreamcast port... just take it from me, please."
2,Peter?s Woven Grass Mat for Rabbits,Rabbit liked it too much... tore it to pieces... it didn't last very long... and he's a small dwarf rabbit!
2,"For the money it's fine, but kind of sucks",It was super cheap so i'm not like mad about it but it's very thin and flimsy and the grass is extremely old and dry.
2,No enough information on product,"These sellers do not give enough information on their rabbit products example all mats should give actual size length and width, crock bowls need their weight not just diameter."
3,Not as large as it looks,"The quality of the mat is thick and good, BUT it is so small. The measurements are not the same as on the package. The bunny in the picture must be very small."
3,paw-rest that doubles as a snack,"I bought these for my Satin Rex doe, whose feet were suffering from the wire floor in her cage. The mats are, as other reviewers stated, on the small side if you have a large rabbit. I ended up changing my doe's cage to one with a level surface (i.e. no more wire floor for the waste to drop through) to spare her feet. She still enjoys her grass mats as an especially cozy spot to lay, but when she's on hers, you can't even see the mat as it is so tiny in comparison to her body."
2,nice mat.......but....,"The idea of these mats is pretty cool and appealing. The reality isn't even close.I found it cheaper to just buy - or pick - some grass, hay, hemp, or whatever, or something for them to chew on. None of my rabbits ever use these to sit on - they just tear them up."
5,Awesome for my bunny,My bunny loves this grass mat. She uses it to lay and play on and nibbles on it. She loves it.
5,Rugged and bunny likes it.,"It has held up really well. Bunny chews on it occasionally, but hasn't really damaged it much.She seems to like using it. And I don't expect to have to replace it very often."
3,As advertised,"It is what it says it is, but my rabbit wasn't interested. She neither sat on it or chewed on it."
1,Cheap rabbit mat,"This is the worst rabbit mat I have ever purchased. The other mats that I have bought typically last my rabbit a couple months. This one lasted a few days. Once he started chewing on it, as rabbits always do, it fell apart. What a waste!"
5,Bunny mats,These mats were for my bunnies and they really loved them - chewed them all up and had a ball doing it. There is a tiny bit of each one left for a little more chewing. It's good for their teeth.
5,Woven Grass Mat,"Excellent product for my Lionhead Bunny!! This is a safe and effective way for him to relieve boredom in his cage. He has chewed on it a bit, however, for the most part it is still in tact after a couple weeks time. He mostly just uses it to sleep on within his bunny box.Will purchase this product again as needed. Not happy to pay shipping cost as the shipping was as much as what the mat cost...However I was unable to find this product anywhere locally."
5,My bunnies love this!,I bought the mat and thePeter's Woven Grass Pet Bedat the same time and while they do play with the bed some this mat is chewed on and played with every day. As they break it apart the grass is in big enough pieces that it is easy to gather up the loose bits. I have taken the loose grass and bundled it up and tied it (with another grass strand) and my rabbits went crazy for that as well.
3,Pretty small,The rabbit in the sample picture is really small! My bunny is as big as the mat.He does like it though. I see him chewing on the corners and unraveling it when he's bored.
4,Grass mat snacks,"These are great. However, don't think your bunnies will use this as a mat to lay or walk on.Most bunnies love to disassemble yummy items and it took mine about an hour to turn this into a pile of individual blades of grass :) but they loved it"
4,Must Have,"Our bunnies love this mat! They chew it up and make a good mess. It saves my carpet and furniture from being chewed. I keep a few around the house in their favorite spots. It can be messy once they have it down to nothing, but well worth the investment."
5,Bunny Love,"My buns loved these mats! Digging on them, chewing on them, throwing them, and eating them. They last for a long time, even with my German Giant / Angora mix tearing these up daily. We bought several for him and they were always something we could buy we knew he would enjoy having in his cage or in his favorite spot to hang out."
3,Nice mat but...,I like this grass mat because it is woven so nicely. But my rabbit loves to eat it nibble it and move it all around. His constant chewing of the mat forced me to take it out so I can get some peace and quiet.
4,Bunny loved it,"Oliver tore into this immediately. Took about a day and half to demolish it. Ate some, tucked it into corners. Moved it out of the cage to the bedroom floor. Made a mess. Ate some more. Had a great time. I will get her more to play with but wish they were cheaper and then I could do it more often."
3,My rabbit didn't like it and chew it up,My rabbit hated this mat. She never stood on it (not like the picture showed). Basically she hated the mat in her cage. So she just chew it and made it disappeared.
3,"Standard, cheap grass mat","My bunny really likes it, but I would suggest leaving it in a cage because he tore it to shreds in about an hour flat."
3,ok -but a little prickly,"The product is as described, but these mats are woven with a lot of rough ends exposed in various places - which means the surface is prickly in spots. I have ordered two kinds of mats now, and the other kind I got was smooth on both sides. I will order the other kind in the future."
2,Not as good as they make it seem...,My rabbit loved this. He loved it a little too much because it only lasted a day because they don't just sit on it like in the picture they chew and dig at it. If it was stronger I would recommend it but until then go find another product.
3,Decent mat,"Decent mat, not what I was expecting, I thought it would be a tad more flexible and comfy for my rabbit, but he just used it to pee on for some reason. He is neutered as well so I don't know why he always wanted to pee on it. I ended up having to throw it away. I will not buy this again for my rabbit, but others might like it."
5,Great Resting Pad,"Got this for our rabbit and she loves it. She's had it a couple of days and she has chewed on it a little, but uses it mostly to rest her little paws on. I will be putting in a second order for this item."
3,Woven mat tastes too good!,"I got this so my bunny could have relief from her wire cage on her feet. Only thing is, she ate it!! It lasted a couple weeks, that's it. It's not cheap enough to buy a couple of these a month. Going to go with wood instead. For a mat, I don't think this was the best material for her, but if your bunny doesn't eat it, it could be great."
4,I love it when I want it.,"It got here on time. And my Rabbit plays, chews and drags it when ever he wants. Some days he really loves it. Some days he does not even know its there. But over all, it makes my Bunny happy. It really depends what kind of bunny you have. Its a little small, so if you have a bunny that loves to chew, it might be gone pretty quick. That's why I didn't give it five stars. Over all its a nice mat for my bunny. I would by one again."
4,"Great Mat, Perfect For Chewing!","I don't feel comfortable using mats in my rabbit's cage that don't specifically note that they're for rabbits, so this product is perfect! It usually takes my bunny about 3 weeks to crew through the whole thing. They used to be sold flat but are now folded in the package, so it takes the mat a bit to unfold which is annoying, but overall it's a great rabbit mat."
4,Small but our bunnies love them!,"Bought a couple of these for our 2 rabbits. As other reviews have stated, the dimensions are incorrect and these are much smaller. Even so, our full grown (and fat) Rex fits in it. Our 2 bunnies are pushing each other out of the way to get in it. Get extras though, they eat through them pretty quick"
1,Peter's Grass Bed for Rabbits & Small Animals,"The dimensions stated are: Size: 13"" x 5"" x 9""BUT the beds I received are: 9.5"" L x 3 3/4"" H x 8.5"" W.Nice for a guinea pig or similar size animal, but MUCH too small for any normal sized, non-miniature adult rabbit!! Also, bottom is not flat so the bed rocks around on a flat surface. I bought three of them mail order and unfortunately I can't return them without paying $8.50 return postage, even though the size was misstated (UPC # 66501 00531) :("
2,Smaller than description states,"I had to return this. It was not even close to the measurements stated in the ad. I had no use for it because it was way too small. Had it been as stated, it would have been perfect."
5,5 Stars!!!,"i didn't buy this for my rabbit, though i do have one who is named Peter Rabbit,(lol) but for my guinea pig. She really liked it because it gave here a safe place to hide , (as guinea pigs are the type who like to hide) and a nice source of food right in her face. she loved it,too! sometimes Peter will chew on it and carry of a few peices, but he isn't really sure exactly sure what it is.you should totaly buy it if you are thinking about it!"
1,Potty trained bunnies,"Our bunnies were really interested with this when we gave it to them, after a few days it really started to stink because they started to use it as a bathroom."
3,little grass pet bed,I purchased several Peter's woven products and this is the only one that I'm a little disappointed in.The bunny pictured in the bed must be a mini because this is not nearly big enough for either of our bunnies to actually sit inside it like it shows in the picture.The grass mats are bigger and they had a lot of fun with the grass ball too.
4,an edible awesome bed,"Arrived in safe packaging. Bunny loved it! A bed he could eat,great for medium to large bunnies, nice high sides."
5,Nice bunny bed,This is a nice bunny bed. It's small for a full sized breed but perfect for smaller rabbits. according to my bunny it's also yummy.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!! FAKE!!!,"I've used Threads for years and this is NOT the same stuff, just some knockoff cheap stuff. I have gone through so many bottles of this stuff over the years and this is DEFINITELY FAKE. I guess someone refilled the manufacturers bottle with cheap hair product??It smells different, and it doesn't look threads when you put it on your hands and pull your hands apart...BUYER BEWARE! THIS IS A FRAUD!!"
1,AMAZON SHOULD REMOVE YOU FROM THIS SITE,"YOU ARE FOR SURE A STUPID PERSONChe and Castro KILLED 1,000's people"
1,What's next?,"Charles Manson cutlery? BTK Killer nylons? Seriously Amazon, ditch the Che gear - he murdered children in front of their parents. Hopefully this will disappear before the Cuban community organizes a boycott against you. Nothing like losing a mil or two in revenue to get your attention."
1,Make terrorists believe you're just one of the gang,"Che Guevara was a racist, writing that blacks are ""indolent and fanciful"" spending money on ""frivolity and drink"". He was also a mass killer. Hundreds were reportedly executed on his watch, and that doesn't include the deaths incurred in the wars he was constantly trying to start. He also wrote how he savored ""the acrid smell of gunpowder and blood of the enemy's death.""The communist revolutionary who dedicated his life to fight capitalism has now become nothing more than a piece of merchandise. Lesson learned: In the end, capitalism always wins."
1,Gimme some more hardcore stuff,"How about a nice Heydrich buckle? Or a Dzerzhinsky one? Maybe some Pol Pot or Abimael Guzman buckles, c'mon! And don't forget a Tirofijo one.So what? Today, when killing folks is again fashionable (thanks Bush) I ain't see the scandal in celebrate mass murderers.Like Angelina Jolie said in her last movie: ""kill a million to save one billion""."
1,I Don't Understand Either.,I was very happy to see that most of the reviewers here have the same opinion I have. I live in a metropolitan area where they sell the same pic on T-shirts. I wish kids were educated to what a horrible dick this guy was. This is a product that should be eraticated. Who are the idiots that produce and design stuff like this?
3,Inspirational and full of ideas,"I agree with another reviewer that the recipes could use suggestions for alternative ingredients and yet the book is still inspirational.I realize that a lot of the recipes are obvious and practical. The book includes some recipes that are very exotic in their origins. It inspires me to make the things that I've been thinking of making and yet when I finally have the time, it isn't obvious to me what I wanted to make, so I'll flip through this book and I'm reminded of some things I want to try."
4,Hyolodyn review,"Great book, everyone should read it and put it into practice. I have doubled my income.RFoster"
2,PowWow In the Ivory Tower,"Take a novel. Hand it to an inexperienced script-writer who only knows genre dialogue, and has never been outside the soap opera community. Make a movie or a tv show that ignores the original audience because the script-writer doesn't read books. So instead of the tongue-in-cheek dry dialogue of a Tony Hillerman, you get a stilted cliche As The World Turns with Injun cops. And I use the word ""Injun"" advisedly. The sneering at the Navajo attitude toward the dead, and at their culture is unbelieveably crass. And the writing down for an American audience -- well, perhaps our reputation for a trashed educational system is getting too well recognized in the world."
2,Bad adaption of a good novel,"The movie adaption is not up to the high standards set by Hillerman's novel [Novel gets a 5-star]. It had the elements to make it a good movie - great story, great actors and the most beautiful setting in the world, the Southwest.But they botched it up- bad direction and screenplay. The deviations from the original story (not major) and the additions were not needed. The scenes are incoherent and some left unexplained. Some of the dialogs are plain stupid, for instance - Emma shows up at Janet's apartment at 5 am looking concerned. And Janet says ""This is not a good time"". In the end it appears as if Leaphorn did not solve the case at all (different from novel).The pluses - Authentic locations (except at Chaco). Good acting by Studi and Beach. The movie does a decent job of showing the Navajo life on reservation, being somewhat true to the novel. And if you are bored of watching NYPD, CSI-Miami etc. etc., the Navajo Tribal Police Dept comes as a refreshing change."
3,Good but lacking,"This melodramatic film is passable but could have been much better. The major problem, as it often is with televised films, is with the script. The story is confusing, with two subplots and flashbacks all going on at the same time. The acting is fine with the exception of a red head playing an archaeologist (or is it anthropologist?) who smirks outrageously throughout her lines. She could have a fine career on daytime soaps.The leading feature in the film is the scenery. That provides half a star on its own. The rest...well, watch it after your brain has said goodnight."
4,Hillerman Rocks,"My husband and I are Hillerman fans and looked forward to seeing the filming of his stories. When living with a Navaho woman, many years ago, I learned a great deal of Navaho culture and enjoyed seeing essences of it filmed. We enjoyed all three films and wish more had been made. The scenery was beautiful; the acting great; and the special features were informative. We highly reccommend all three films."
2,Weak Acting and Screen Play,"This is a horrible PBS Mystery compared to the British ones. The acting is weak. For people who have not read the book, the ending left many questions unanswered like why were the first two murders committed?"
4,A thief of time,The movie followed the book pretty good Really interesting.enjoyed the movie and the service was pretty fast. Would recommend to others
4,Good read,I enjoyed this story as it felt like a classic love story. The characters are trying to find themselves and realize who they are as they fall in love and begin their lives. I really liked it because it was an uncomplicated but touching story.
1,Sorry to say I was disappointed...,"There isn't anything worse than a bad book. I had a hard time even getting half way thru this book! I never finished it. I really did not like it. I thought the characters where boring, the romance was tacky. I hate bad reviews because that means I just read a lame book. Sorry :("
2,dissappointing,"Fantastic story, but this edition seems to skip significant passages from the orginal. Lots of texture, nuance and story narrative is lost in the process. Big disappointment. Find another edition."
5,"If You're a Follower of The Way, Buy this Book...","The Chronicles of Tao offers a rare glimpse into little-known aspects of China as well as Taoism. This fictionalized account of the life and spiritual path of Saihung immerses the reader into a culture richly portrayed by Deng Ming-Dao. Alternately exciting, funny, surprising, and insightful, TCoT does bog down in places but is a worthwhile read."
2,such a disappointing edition,"I just received this disappointing single volume collection of the three related books:The Wandering TaoistSeven Bamboo Tablets of the Cloudy SatchelGateway to a Vast WorldThe combined edition seems to be missing all the diagrams and drawings. For this reason, if you are a serious reader, I recommend buying the books separately. The Wandering Taoist seems to be only available as a used book. The others are available used or in expensive ($20) editions."
1,Fiction Passed Off As Fact,"Sadly, this book seems to be an attempt to create a real-life character based from what is obviously fiction. Eventhough the book reads very well, those seeking true historical facts about the life of Taoists should look elsewhere. I recommend looking toward some of the material written by any numbers of scholars specializing in Taoism (Livia Kohn, Michael Saso, etc.). This book is nonsense!"
2,Taoism 101,"I found this book to be a fairly informative,yet bland introduction to Taoist culture. Also a bit formulaic in it's tendency to glorify the ""mystery"" of it all."
5,10 stars.,"It seems to me that this book has definitely been underrated in one specific area, it's capacity as a teaching manual. Don't misunderstand me, there are no exact step by step instructions, but there is a wealth of information that profoundly elucidates taoist philosophy and practice. For anyone aspiring to the Path, this book is of immeasurable value as encouragement and a thourough grounding in Taoist priciples. I can't say enough in thanks to the author and Master Saihung for allowing his story to be shared."
5,more than my expectation,I received the dvd after 2 weeks from the order even if was expected to be dispached within 1 month and half. Very good!!
5,Simple ipod car solution.,"If you're looking for something to use your iPod in your car and don't want to deal with the issues of transmitters, this makes for a great choice. Simple, the wires have range, and the sound quality is better than a transmitter for less than half the price.The only downsides I can think of is there's nothing to hold your iPod, so unless you've got a convenient cubby close to a power source and your cassette deck, it could require some finesse to set up, and more things come with the kit than you really need to set it up in your car. Not that I'm complaining..."
3,"""It's Okay""","While I was quite disappointed in the sound when using the plug in tape portion of this kit (I eventually bought an FM transmitter to use with my IPod) the variety of chargers, extra headphones and the ""holder"" have been very useful. Would I buy it again? Probably not."
3,disappointed,"I bought this pencil sharpener thinking that it did have the auto stop but it does not. It sharpens pencils fine, but is not as fast as its larger counterpart. I'm disappointed in it overall."
1,The worse pencil sharpener ever....,"I do NOT recommend buying this pencil sharpener. Another poorly ""Made In China"" item to add to my collection. I've wasted numerous pencils because it unevenly sharpens. For example, one side will be sharp and the other side still has the wood all the way to the tip....so you have to keep sharpening to try and even it out, wasting much of the pencil. It's really annoying that something so simple doesn't even function properly."
1,Poor construction,"Bought one of these at Costco. Within a year the plastic gear on the internal motor broke, so all the machine would do is make a grinding sound but not sharpen. Then bought a replacement at Costco. That one didn't work even out of the box - completely dead.These are junk, I will move on to a different brand."
4,Functional sharpener,"As a small business owner, my office products and equipment must be efficient, cost-effective and functional. I've found that the iPoint electric pencil sharpener does its job, but didn't knock my socks off. First of all, I was surprised to hear the motor laboring when I pushed a pencil in with a little bit of force. Sure, I was in a hurry to get a fresh point, but it seemed to take longer than it should. I've since discovered that a slight amount of pressure works best and doesn't over-burden the motor.The form and function are fine, and I expect it to last a long time with the titanium bonded cutting blades. Also, don't let the reservoir fill too much before emptying, or it will be messy. In all, I'd say this was a good medium-duty sharpener, suitable for the home or a small office."
1,Broke after 1 month,"Yes, this thing worked well - for a month. Now it just spins and spins with no results. Too bad I can't find my receipt."
1,Bad bad sharpener,"This sharpener is of very poor quality. It works temporarily until it melts down -- batteries short out quickly, with a loud pop and lots of heat. Stay away from this piece of junk."
1,It looks nice but dies easily,"For the record, it does sharpen the pencils easily - but every time when I try to dump the pencil waste, and afterwards, the iPoint died! There must be some stupid design in it that triggers the auto-stop bug and it's a stop *forever*! I have tried 3 times and it failed me 3 times.Decide for yourself if you want it."
1,Poor Pencil Sharpener,"As a classroom teacher, I do not recommend buying this sharpener. I was looking for a sturdy pencil sharpener for the classroom. This looked like it would hold up. As you can see it is March and I am shopping for a new sharpener. It only sharpens one side of the pencil. My students are left with one side all wood and one side of lead showing. I have to be creative and find a way to chip the wooden side of the point. Not a good buy for the money."
4,Excellent for 2009 Toyota RAV4,"This product is solidly constructed and comes with large universal side mirror pockets. Heavyweight material (check the Covercraft website for properties of Technalon) -- and the four year warranty is reassuring.Nice and snug around the vehicle, covering the outboard spare tire as well. Had considered an expensive custom cover, but this works just fine.Does not come with a grommet for antennas, even though customer service from Covercraft said it did. The RAV4 has a small rear deck antenna. I'll place a plastic cone over it so I won't have to put a hole in the car cover, and the antenna won't be bent after the cover comes off.The color is a very light tan; I would have liked a slightly deeper tan but lighter does reflect sunlight better than darker.All in all, well worth the money and an excellent alternative to a custom cover that easily costs 2X."
2,32-bit only for 2 out of 3 games!,"I got this on a recommendation from a blog that rated these games very highly for pre-K to 1st grade kids. As I have a 3-year-old and a 6-year-old, I was very excited to find this set so affordable on Amazon. Unfortunately, 2 out of the three games (the I Spy and Huggly Saves the Turtles games) will only play on 32-bit systems and are NOT compatible with newer 64-bit computers. The Clifford game installs and seems to be playing fine, but we are disappointed that the other two are completely useless for us."
4,Good Purchase,"The animals' eyes look too crazed but overall craftsmanship is good. The tunes it plays are cute and simple, not too annoying."
5,This is great with essential oils and fragrances!,"I ordered this warmer to use essential oils and fragrances after viewing other sites which said this could be used with liquid oils. I was disappointed when it arrived and the instructions said ""never use water, chemicals or oil in this unit."" In choosing to use oils I understood the product would not last. I have used it daily for nearly 2 weeks, my house smells great! In using oils, I can change the strength of the scent to very strong to weak by adding water. I am glad I ordered this warmer!"
4,quick shipping,Very nice warmer. I had a problem with the tray. It had a hairline crack in it and Seaboutique replaced the tray right away! Thank you.
1,BEWARE,"I had a bad case of poison oak and was told by the pharamacist to wash with the Tecnu. I was on hydrocortozone as well. I washed with the product and my case worsened and here I am 5 months later with skin damage, and still seeing a dermotologist. Be careful."
5,My girlfriend swears by it!,My other half if extremely allergic to many things since she is Atopic. Very sensitive skin. She applies this with good results. I think we will be long term users of this product.
3,This stuff will only work if you have not developed the rash yet,"I got this stuff cause I had a slight break out, a few spots on my forearms and a slight spot below my eye. I was recommended this stuff so I picked it up and used it. The small rash I had turned into a massive reaction that ended up with my eyes swollen shut and the poison ivy all over my body. This stuff, if you use it when you have the rash, actually spreads the oil out and you end up with a worse rash. If you get poison ivy and the rash has already developed, then just use caution to not spread it and regular soap with a steroid cream. You will completely regret using tecnu if you have the rash. I gave it three stars cause I havent used it like its supposed to be used so I cant speak to how it works as far as preventing the rash."
3,balanced experience,"worked well the first time i used it, whjen the rash from poison ivy was kind of older, but now with my current, worse case of poison oak, its not lived up to the hype.."
1,This did not work for me.,"I used this product over and over and it's not helping. Sure it takes away the itch, but there's NO WAY it removes the oil. I use it twice a day, I've had poison ivy for FOUR WEEKS now. I just keep getting it in other places. I'm going to go buy Zanfel."
1,Save your money. It doesn't work.,My daughter has an extreme reaction to poison ivy and we bought some of this stuff to help her get rid of it by washing with it. She tried it for two summers with absolutely no results. We finally took her to a skin doctor who told us that this product doesn't work and gave us a prescription wash. The Rx wash works much better. Tecnu is a waste of your money. Don't buy it.
1,So much worse!,This product has made my poison ivy rash itch so much more and spread. GHAAAAAAA it itches! Stay away from this product.
5,Great Product,I never heard of this product but was desperate to stop my 6yr old from scratching and spreading the rash. It stops the itching longer than the doctor prescribed oral medication. I have even seen a decrease in redness of the affected area.
4,Technu / Poision Ivy Review,"Key to getting rid of poison ivy is prevention and knowing that you came across it. The earlier this product is used the better. In my case I didn't know I came across it or something that had the oil (maybe my dog). Now I have rashes on my forearms, I did apply this and it does stop the itching. Im not sure about the removing the oil once the oil is deep in the skin which causes the rash. Again this product, like most products are probably most effective when the rash is in its early stages. The more you use it the better. I bought mine at my local CVS for $17. A little pricy but after nothing else works you are willing to try anything."
5,Works better than Cortaid Poison Ivy Care Removal Scrub,"I had very good results with Tecnu Extreme Medicated Poison Ivy Scrub. The next time I got poison ivy, I couldn't find it, so I tried Cortaid's version. Cortaid's version was better than nothing, but did not work nearly as well as Tecnu. In both cases, I used the scrub after a rash had developed. Both products relieved the itch, but I thought Tecnu did a better job of keeping the rash from spreading."
1,Did not work,"Purchased tecnu at the local drug store 5 days after poison ivy appeared on forearms. It did not relieve the burning or itching and washing with tecnu only ended up spreading the poison ivy further. If you have poison ivy, get a steroid shot or pills for real relief."
4,Works Well But Cortaid by J&J Costs Much Less,"Like most people, I'm allergic to poison ivy and poison oak and have had innumerable cases throughout my life ranging from mild to severe. Absent a shot of cortisone for a moderate-severe rash, Tecnu Extreme works well at reducing itching and speeding healing. However, Johnson & Johnson has come out with Cortaid -- same function and effect -- for less than half the price of Tecnu."
1,technu extreme review,I was sold on this product until I used it. It does not help poison ivy outbreaks at all. It does NOT shorten its rash life. It does NOT reduce itching. It does NOT reduce rash life. This product is good for nothing except emptying your wallet.
4,Very pleased with this product!,"I have yet to use this product, but it sounds like it will work well, when ever I would need to use it. The shipping/processing speed was a little slower than I would have liked, but it did arrive with in the shipping dates given."
1,Not like the origional oak and ivy,I have had many cases of poison oak and for years i used the oak n ivy clenser and its worked great. Recently my local walgreens stopped selling the normal stuff and went for this. This stuff is crap. Its irritated my skin and has made the rash spread faster. The oak and ivy cleanser was much better and would reduce my poison oak fast.0 star on effectivness(made it worse)Oak and Ivy cleanser 5stars. GO BUY THIS STUFF!
3,Not for all bird cages,"We used this waterer with our old bird cage, and it worked just fine. Especially once we got the hang of how to flip it over without losing all the water in it! A really good feature is that the birds can't soil the water and yet they can still drink as if they were outdoors. The problem came when our finches began escaping the old cage, which had 5/8in bar spacing. We got a new cage with 3/8 in bar spacing, and this item didn't work with the narrower bars."
5,GO COCKS!,"My baby was born into a USC Gamecocks family and has worn this outfit many, many, many times throughout the first year of his life. We are very happy with it!"
3,Good - But Not Neoprene!,"This case is O.K. but not great. Price reflects quality. This fits the Zen Vision:M 30GB, although some of the other reviewers are purchasing for the 60GB. I don't know what others have received, but this is made of plastic and not anywhere near ""neoprene scuba"" rubber material. It has a ""felt-like"" inside surface and smooth black (not shiny) outer surface.Pros:Case itself fits well and has openings in all the right placesSmall metal landyard ring on middle back for your own strapWorks for the priceCons:Should be ""neoprene scuba-like"" look - not actual rubber & not paddedAgree with reviewer that said arm band strap being flimsy"
4,Excellent for the Price,"The price was the main thing that attracted me to this product...I wanted a case for my zen but wasn't too particularly concerned about scratches, except those to the screen. I really like this one. I can access all ports and buttons because of the way the case is designed. There is a clear plastic screen in front of the zen screen. It protects the screen and does not interfere with watching video.The only thing I don't like is the armband. The armband itself is okay, but the two narrow straps that you are supposed to put the armband through are flimsy. One ripped off shortly after purchase while I was trying to adjust the armband. The little plastic disc you attach the belt clip too also sticks into your arm. The Zen Vision: M is kinda heavy for an armband anyway however. Other than this, the product is good."
2,"SUBSTANDARD QUALITY, YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET",HINGES ARE LOW QUALITY AS WELL AS HANDLES. YOU MUST CARRY BY BOTH HANDLES OR RISK LOSING INVESTMENT. IN OTHER WORDS A PIECE OF JUNK
2,Terrible hanging sleeves,"The outer case for this product is fine, and comparable with another metal case I have, other than using plastic handles instead of metal, but the sleeves are terrible. Each plastic sleeve contains 4 small pieces of plastic that need to be removed before you can even use it. I timed removing them from one sleeve at 31 seconds, so it may take 5 hours to remove them all in a case this size, not to mention generate a big pile of small pieces of trash. The sleeves are also very cheap-feeling, and the poor molding on the plastic hangers interferes with tracking. Actually placing the disks in the sleeves is a rough fit, and I worry about scratching the disks."
1,Poorly constructed,"Very little padding meant that by the time the item arrived one corner was literally falling out. It had been banged apart in shipping. Inside, the case looks decent, it has rails for hanging three rows of CD/DVD discs and includes dozens of plastic sleeves. But the construction of the case itself is so poor that neither Super glue nor Elmer's can ensure. When I tried lugging it by the handle the side was literally coming out. Too bad. The only reason I did not return it was because I was so busy that it sat for a week when it arrived before I gave it a glance. I'll keep looking for better item."
3,Watch out for the Glitch,"My 8-year-old son loves this game, but the glitch is really a problem. You get all the way to the end, prepared to play the final round, and then you have an ""o"" where you should have an ""l,"" and you can't go on. If you can stand that disappointment, it's still fun to play, and blessedly non-violent. As for the ""true"" nature of Batman, my son is clueless, so I'm not worried about that. Except for the glitch, it's a great game--I like playing it too. I'd buy it again for a reduced price."
1,NO!,"woah woah woah woah woah... Batman is violent. Batman is disturbed. Batman is a borderline madman. Batman is just inches away from the edge and being a killer... Batman is not for five year olds and for any Batman product to cater to five year olds is a terrible misunderstanding of the character. It's like making a version of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" where everybody goes home after having learned a lesson. No. Just... no."
1,The worse Iris book I have ever seen!,"While reading all these nice reviews about this book I am tempted to write my own opinion. So it is - this is the worse book about Irises I have ever seen. First, do not expect much information from this book. The book contains mostly pictures and pictures are the bad part of this book. Some of them are out of focus, some other have completely wrong light, many pictures are with gray, bad colors, etc. Finally, many pictures doesn't really show the structure of the flower, they show something that sometimes even doesn't look like a flower. In a few occasions I found also that text and the picture doesn't match (or the picture was so bad).Any way, I am very disappointed. I lost some $$."
2,Not quite what I expected,"Only the first few pages contain information. First page covers types of irises, second page tells how to read the book, third page covers planting and growing tall bearded iris. All the other pages are just alphabetically listed iris photos with a caption below each one detailing: hybridizer, year, bloom season and height. This pictorial guide is simply like another iris catalog."
4,"slow, but worth the money","per my experience, it is not usb 2.0, but 1.1, but considering the price, who will mind that?"
1,BUYER WARNING: Will not work with a case,"The product works...unfortunately, the connector that goes through the bottom of the ipod has a snug fit. It will not go through any case. I have one of the thinnest hard shell cases with an opening left at the bottom, but even a few millimeters will prevent the attachment from connecting. You will need to remove your case each and every time to use this charger."
1,Does not stay extended,"I purchased five, three would not stay extended right out of the box. I dropped one and apparently that broke the extension-lock. The only positive is that they do charge my phone and seem to let it communicate with my computer."
1,Looks good does not function,I loved the convenience of the design. IT DOESN'T WORK. IT DID NOT WORK FROM THE FIRST TIME I TRIED IT. It's not even big enough to use as a paper weight.
4,"Cheap, portable useful","I picked this up in 2009 and it works great. The retractable big is a little flimsy and the cable seems kind fo weak, but the connection is fine so keeping it on a desk, in a drawer or in a backpack works great.The cost was cheap, which makes this completely worth it for a replacement or spare cable. My girlfriend keeps this in her desk drawer for her ipod and I'm thinking about getting one for my travel pack so I can always charge my phone."
2,Breaks after 2 weeks,"I bought this item for $[...] with no shipping costs. I received the item rather quickly. I carried the item in my purse in a special compartment, so the retractable cord was great. When I first used it, it was a little fussy, but then worked fine for two weeks. After that, I began getting syncing errors, and it began to become unpredictable with charging. I am sure to get only genuine apple cords from now on."
2,Did not last long.,"Purchased this for the retractable feature, so as not to have a long cable all over my desk. Great idea, but poor quality. Did not last very long until it broke, since then I have gone back to regular cables. Rather deal with a long cable then poor reliability."
1,Waste of time,Don't bother with this. Doesnt work most of the time when plugged in to iPhone 3g. Go buy an ice cream instead.
4,"For the money, its a good buy","At first, I was a bit skeptical about this, but then I decided to take a leap of faith and went with buying it. Its been 2-3 weeks since I got the product and have been using it everyday almost, and I'm happy."
4,Does what it needs to,I'm happy with this retractable Ipod Touch cable. It does exactly as it should and the retraction still works; I've been careful pulling on the ends. Connection plug goes in snug and stays until I want to remove it. Computer and wall charger have not had any issues seeing the Ipod.
3,Took two times to get it right,"Pros:- Seller ships fast- Decent customer serviceCons:- May not actually work** I received the cable and the moment I opened the package, I knew immediately that it wouldn't work. Why? Because the shape of the plug of the USB wasn't even rectangular. It was slightly bent to some odd shape. For $2, I thought...eh, you get what you paid for. But I sent an email to customer service anyways telling them that my usb cord was flawed. They sent me a new cable quickly and the new cable actually worked.So...if you are willing to take a risk and spend some time going back and forth, go for it.If not, get something else."
2,"Charges, but doesn't sync","I bought this for my IPod Touch 3g since I lost my sync/charging cable. This charges my unit just fine, just doesn't work as a sync cable."
3,You get what you pay for,"It's not bad at all, just don't expect much for how much it is. Everything's good about it except sometimes its very slow syncing with my iPhone (mostly slows down itunes)... but no biggy if you're patient and realize how much you bought it for"
3,Good for the price,"You can't beat this for the price, it works perfectly fine, but can get stuck a little bit sometimes."
4,Its exactly what you buy,"I have had it for a few weeks now and it works just fine no problems. Its obviously made from a cheaper material than the original one from APPLE but for its price it is well worth it, plus it has a retractable cord for easy storing."
1,Horrible Quality; Won't fit iPhone jack smoothly,"The quality of this item is pretty bad. I plugged my iphone into it a couple of times, but I wont try again because the connector doesn't fit properly and feels like it's going to break off!"
3,Didn't work for very long,"I originally wrote a glowing 5-star review for this product, but I found eventually that it doesn't last very long. I'm now quite happy with the Monoprice-brand cables I bought to replace these ones. They aren't retractable, but they're built more robustly than Apple's official cable and are definitely more solid than this retractable cable."
2,Not what is pictured.,"I ordered two of these items to use with an adapter on my car and avoid the mess of cables that there is normally with my current car charger. It was very disappointing to see the dock is nothing like the picture displays and with my current case won't plug in to my iPhone 4. Not much use for them now.Aside from that, the package was in great condition, it arrived quite fast and the retractable piece works fine.BEWARE! This won't fit with most of the cases. If you're bold and don't use any on your phone, then this cable is a good purchase."
2,Does Not Sync with Ipod Touch 3G,"Besides waiting weeks for it to arrive from China, when I finally go it,I get an error message when I connect this to my Ipod Touch 3G to my Windows XP computer saying ""USB device not recognized."" It does show a charge when I connect it to my AC/usb adapter. Buy it only if only want it to charge your Ipod/phone and not to sync."
3,iPod retractable cable,This cable does not work on iphone 3 or iphone 4 models. This will work for a 5th generation iPod video.
3,Gave up the ghost after a year,"I keep a charger in my backpack for when my iPod, Bluetooth headset, and cell phone are running low on power. I like retractable cables because they prevent the cords from tangling up, and this one was the right price.However, recently (after a little more than a year) the cable wouldn't charge my iPod Touch (3rd gen). After a little detective work I found that the cable was at fault. Your experience may vary, of course, but be advised that the cable has failed for at least one owner."
1,Didn't work for me...,"This charger did not charge Ipod or Iphone. Too cheap to return... the retractable mechanism worked quite well, but still point if it doesn't charge anything."
1,useless with a case,"I was disapointed with this sync cord. i cant use it unless the case is off, and it's a pain in the butt to take it off, so i am just not using it. If you order this make sure your case isa very slim case or easy to take on and off."
1,Charges super slow ... if at all!,"This retractable charger stinks! Avoid it and look for others with greater charging power. Sometimes, i have to plug/unplug this device 20-30 times till it works...and when it does work, it takes about 3 hours to charge any apple product! What a joke!"
2,crap,"I had it out of the package less than 5 minutes before the wind-up mechanism shattered and flew all over the room. The cable itself seems to work, although it seems flimsy as well. I'm using it as a back up."
1,Not Case Compatible,This case is not what is pictured. The phone-side of the able is large and square and does not fit into the iPhone or iPod with the case one. Not recommended.
4,"Cheap, but works.","I bought a few cheap iPhone sync/charge cables. This was one of them. It is very thin and probably just as flimsy as the one Apple gives you with your device. I plugged it in and it worked, no fuss, with iPhone 4. Also I find the retractable part to be just a nuisance - something to get broken. The cable is very short as it is, making the spool in the middle almost pointless."
4,Ipod retractable charger,"The charger does exactly what I wanted it to do, provide easy-to-use additional charging capability for my Ipod.Ipod Mini / Nano / Video Retractable"
1,not what is pictured,Product is not round as shown in the picture. Is a square fixture which I was trying to avoid so I would be able to use it with my ottobox casing.
2,"This is OK, i guess, not that great.","I received exactly what is picutred but the cable does not extend that far, its actually shorter than the USB cable that comes with the iPhone/iPod, I planned to use it for long distances but I ended up using it for the USB connection in my car stereo."
1,Not same as picture.,I bought this one too going by the picture and that the info said by apple. After researching the apple website I found that apple does not sell a retractable of this. Will not fit in Speck case for iphone 4s. Not happy!!!
2,Poor,"the quality of this was not very good, it did not last more than 4 months before it was useless. I bought a different brand for the second one"
3,Will Last at Least a Year,"This is great if you're tired of all the clutter of wires and if you travel with it a lot. I've used it across two countries and for about two years now and only recently did it start getting a little flaky with its connection (connecting and disconnecting when my ipod charges). It still works most of the time, and it worked absolutely perfectly for the first year and a half at least. So, if you take good care of it (as you should with any wire), it is a good little product for the discount price."
1,"Good idea, Flawed product","The concept is as desired, however, the case fell apart, the end cover did not stay together and within three weeks failed to provide a charge to the Iphone. Was a waste of time and money to purchase. Not recommended."
3,"Good Intention, Poor Execution","The intention is good - make it retractable, and you won't have to deal with a messy and/or tangled chord. However, the way it's made is so cheap that the chord itself ends up being tangled in the retracting ""house.""The chord is very thin, so it does not extend and retract smoothly, therefore it ends up tangling on itself as you try to pull it out and reel it in.But I gave it 3 stars because it's so inexpensive.Ultimately, you get what you pay for - this is a cheap product in both senses of the word."
4,Good option for travel.,This cable works well and retracts out of the way which is a big plus when traveling or for a quick move when using a notebook PC.
2,Unreliable,"Bought two of these. One is fine, the other just stopped working after using it less than a month."
1,fail,bought 3 - 2 have failed. 1st unit failure was absolutely no connection (power or data transfer) after working fine for about 2 months. 2nd unit failure was plugging it in caused other USB connections to stop working.
4,Great for the price,"I've had this for a couple weeks now - it is as pictured, and I've not had any problems with the cable. Occasionally, there's been a little problem pulling it out to a length, or retracting, but it's not a serious issue...just try again, and it will likely pull to desired length or retract.Great buy for the money, no real complaints. I would definitely recommend."
1,Cheap,I ordered this a while ago and have only used it twice. Now the product does not work. I am very disappointed and have requested a replacement; I will update this review after I receive seller's reply.UPDATE:I have received my replacement even that does not work either. My computer still says a USB device has malfunctioned and it does not recognize it. Do not buy.
1,What was I thinking,"This unit caused a USB port surge that shut down all USB operated items (keyboards, mouse) on computer in office. I have had to restore my computer at least three times. And I can not return it, as it is over 30 days.My advice to you... choose another USB cord."
4,Just as expected,"Just as advertised, fits my needs as expected. Fabulous value for the price. Apple wants 18.95 to do what this little gem does. I wanted to use it to connect from my keyboard USB to my iPod Touch -without a lot of extra cord hanging around! Will not take a lot of abuse as is fairly light weight - what do I expect for $3.00?!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,This thing is garbage. It stopped working after the first charge. I know it was cheap but the shipping cost so much more that I expected it to at least be a decent charger that would last me longer than one day.
2,not as shown,the ipod end of the cable is wider than shown (it has the lock release tabs on the sides)so it does not fit into the i-phone with the otter case on.
5,Well pleased.,It works well; just make sure you pull it from both ends or else it gets tangled up. Good buy for the price.
4,Does what it is supposed to,"I purchased this cable knowing that it would be a bit short for my desk, heck... I wanted to use it to plug my ipod into my car USB charger. It is small. It does offer some audible interference when using this in conjunction with headphones. Other than that, I'd buy one again."
4,Pretty good for the price,"This was the cheapest connector I could find to replace my cord when the vacuum ate it! I've only had it a couple of hours, but my experience so far is that the construction is definitely cheap (I ordered two and one of them suffers from the wires being exposed slightly where they go into the USB connection). Fortunately, these are cheap as dirt. Be warned that mine came in a standard USPS shipping envelope with no packaging. Looks like they just tossed them in and shipped them. Also, they oddly made the shipping ""Time Sensitive."" Good for me, because I was relying on my car adapter for power for a few days!Overall, they seem OK so far and it's going to be nice to have one at work where I don't need to worry too much if it gets snatched."
5,They work well--what more to say?,"I bought two, because I always seem to need another iPhone charging cable. They work well with my iPhone 4, both with the power charging module and for syncing with my Mac. The plug fit easily into my snap-on iPhone case. The retraction mechanism is a standard pull-from-both-ends-at-once one, and it works just fine. Yes, there are squeeze-release tabs on both sides of the plug, so take care to squeeze them when removing so as not to harm your device. All-in-all a good buy."
4,Great for the price!,"I bought this to have a spare connector. It works great, but every once in awhile it seems to not charge my iPhone. You have to make sure it is connected right, but not a big deal."
2,Sensitive Retraction,Charges well and extends and locks reasonably well. But the retraction is very sensitive. Slightest bump and it retracts . Very inconvenient in the car while talking on phone.
1,Cable Not What Is Pictured,"The cable they sent me is not what is pictured. I was looking for an inexpensive cable that would fit into my IPhone 3Gs while the case was still on. The cable pictured has an iphone/ipod connector that is rounded like the Apple branded version. Unfortunately, the ones they sent me are completely rectangular, so now I'm forced to shave down the plastic and glue the housing back together. That is precisely what I was trying to avoid."
1,good cable but bad retracting mechanism,"this product is dirt cheap and it does a good job at charging, but thats about it. when it comes to retracting the mechanism does not lock and it breaks easily. i got one and upon leaving bad review they sent me a new one, not 5 seconds after opening it the darn thing broke, so now im stuck with a cable which does the job but i guess one cant be picky if its only one cent, if u want a retractable cable this is not the cable for u"
2,Poor fit and doesn't retract,"When I initially purchased this, the connector appeared to be too big to fit into my iphone. I loosened it up in an old ipod from our technology graveyard, and after it fit easily into my phone.I was thrilled at first with the size and ease of this product. It's compact enough to stash in your purse or pocket for the inevitable daily iphone battery death, and you don't have to deal with messy wires getting tangled up in your hairbrush or other mystery purse contencts.However, after a couple of days of use, the cord stopped retracting on one side. I've also found that it only connects and charges about half of the time - it's very fickle about positioning on the USB side.I'd suggest shelling out a couple of extra dollars for a more reliable cable."
4,"Cheap but portable, and it works","My original USB cord finally ripped at the dock part, but it lasted as long as it was supposed to. I've been trying other 3rd party USB cords, but most of them end up causing the ""unsupported accessory"" message every time it plugs in. I got this charger a couple of days and haven't any pesky messages yet. You can tell it's a little cheap and I'm a bit wary of the cords on each side, but as long as you use a reasonable amount of caution, it should be fine. It's also very convenient to carry around and you won't have to worry about any wear and tear from being stuffed inside a backpack or a purse. One thing I don't like about it is the length; it's pretty short compared to most USB cords."
5,Great,"Great transaction easy and quick will do business again, great item should come in handy one day! . . . . . ."
4,charger retractor,I got these since the wire retracts and that keeps the wire from getting tangled and broken. Also easy storage. Just throw in the drawer. No tangles or broken wires
1,Does NOT work for 3GS or Newer iPhones and Devices,Bought this and learned really quickly the cord does not work on an iPhone 3GS or any other newer devices. I was very disappointed.This does work on an iPhone 3G and first gen.The cord was very flimsy and shorted a few minutes after.
2,"Crappy quality, you get what you pay for","The connector still works but the retractable part died the second day of use. I pulled it to use it and it didn't retract after that. For the price, it's a cheap backup charging cable."
1,very poor quality,"i bought three of this item. upon pulling the cord out for the first time two broke instantly. They litterally broke apart with bits of plastic falling off. one worked just fine. the company was responsive and replaced the two broken ones with no questions. however one of the two new ones broke apart immedialty too. i would say stay away from this product. if you really want a retractable cord, i think it is worth while to spend a littel more on one that is better quality. in this case you really do get what you pay for."
3,"Decent for the price, low quality","The cable works with my iphone 4, ipad, and iphone 5 with a 30 pin to lightning adapter. However, the cable is not very durable and I can see the wires exposed by the pin connector side only after my 3rd time using it.Also note, the actual cable is different from the photo. The 30 pin connector isn't shaped like that, it's more blocky and has release grip on it.I didn't expect much for the price, it's cheap enough to buy multiple ones in case one of them breaks. I would suggest buying more than you need so you can have a spare or buy a better quality one."
3,Worked between 6 months and a year...,"It worked between 6 months and a year before, like usual, the coil unraveled. Even now, it works on the rare occasion, but usually the ""USB device not recognized."" message pops up so it doesn't charge."
1,Fell Apart Second Usage!,"The retractable cable device is about as flimsy (Okay - cheap) as I've seen. In my wife's car, used twice, the white plastic casing fell off the USB frame. I glued it back on, but the USB frame itself wiggles precariously. Quite seriously, for short-term use, emergency back-up, it might be handy. But for regular, reliable use it won't last very long unless handled with absolute ""kid-gloves"" I don't know anyone who could manage that. Retractable devices, in general, are a long-shot. Seller was ""Seller1ON1""."
2,"Such a hassle, didn't work.","Sometimes these cheap iphone accessories work and other times it seems you get what you pay for. For this particular product it's the latter. It worked sometimes, most of the times I'd get a message saying that your phone isn't compatible with the charger. Until I unplugged it and plugged it back in 25 times in order for it to work, only to walk back to it to see the same error message. The retractable part worked and saved space, but not really worth it when it doesn't charge your phone. I usually don't write reviews on Amazon, but this product is a piece of junk."
1,i phone usb data sync,this product didnt work for my I pod. it wouldnt fit in the connection to the I pod . waste of time :(
2,worked sometimes,This product worked at first then it stopped working with ocasional moments where the charge would take effect. Threw it away.
4,iphone usb retractable cable,Wire is little to short and iphone repeats warning the cable is not supported other wise great price and works like it should.
4,Adapter cable works,This product is great for the money. I bought 10 of them and will never need to look for an adapter again.
2,Worked for a while,"This cord worked for the better part of a year until it just started to give problems, I never really expected much of it but I expected more. The small wires in the connection to the phone are very easy to break and that's what happened to me, it also lost it's ability to retract after a while. It worked great while it lasted and one could argue that I use it more than others because my iPhone needs a new battery but I'm going to try another one."
3,Retractable iPOD Charger,"This product has a good idea behind it, but lacks the construction. It says there are (4) levels of length, but when you retract it to charge your iPOD, it doesnt stay at any length. It is reliable in the sense that it definitely charges, but I just think that the design is flawed. What I do like about it is that a normal iPOD charger doesn't lock in, this one does.All in all, a decent buy for the $. A regular iPOD charger would have a longer cable, probably last longer, and would be a better buy overall. Not all that impressed, but I needed a charger quick! I still use it a month later so it def is reliable to charge!"
4,Broke after some slight abuse but...,"WHO CARES? It's dirt cheap! It snaps solidly into both the USB port and the iPhone. Perfect for that go-to person, but if you need a long cable you may want something else. I had the thing for a good 5 months before I accidentally bent the plug. It survived but it's sort of touchy now.P.S. There's an identical charger in black somewhere in Amazon, but in my experience it doesn't plug in solidly at all and I have been having a few issues."
3,It works.,I ordered this cable in five months ago. The cable I got didn't look exactly like the picture on the product now. The iPhone end of the cable is bilky and feels cheap. There was no sheath coming from off the iPhone end to protect where the wires meet the plug. After only three months of sporatic use the wires started to come apart. It served it's purpose for a while. Great product for use in the car but it could use better a little better construction.
1,Did not work both of them which I bought from this seller,I bought two quantities of Iphone charger from this seller. I connected to my lap top to check. Both of them did not work. It did not beep or giving any sign that it is charging. I left it to see for more than 5 hours on each of them. Still it did not charge. It did not costed much but still it is a waste of time..
2,Won't lock in place,"This would be handy if the reel would lock when fully extended, but I ordered 2 and neither will lock."
3,It's ok,"It's ok, especially considering the price. It works. Mine has trouble staying extended (shrinks back like a frightened turtle at the slightest provocation)."
5,Riveting!!! You cannot put this book down.,"This is one of the best World War II books I have ever read. It is a combination of history text and memoir and will appeal to readers of each type. This book is well researched, and well documented and tells the story of Anzio that is both informative and engaging."
1,Save your money,"If you have to see this, rent it. Or better yet, borrow someone else's copy. This is not Tim and Harvey at their best. It is more like a couple of friends making a home video for submission to America's Funniest."
3,Good But Not Their Best,"We love Tim Conway & Harvey Korman together!! We did enjoy this one, but we also felt it was not one of their best. I think the problem was more in the writing than their performance."
5,The Great Outdoors DVD,This item arrived in good condition. My son was amused with this DVD and wondered where I had ordered it from. I plan on borrowing it from him to watch it. Thanks.
2,waterlogged,"I purchased this watch to wear as an everyday watch...I swam with this watch that is supposed to be ok to wear in water...wrong, water ruined the watch and now after only owning it for 3 months I have to throw it away...next time I'll buy a Casio."
3,Boring,This book is boring and it is just a collection of stuff that is found around the web assembled without feeling and motivation
2,Seams irritate toes,I was not happy with this item. The seams irritated my toes when I had the fin boot on and especially when I wore my zoomers with it. I am thinking of returning it for a refund. The last 2 swims I have had to take them OFF so that my feet were not tingling. The rubbing of the zoomers was more comfortable than the seams rubbing my toes.
5,Totally Absorbing and Beautifully Written,"Just This Side of Normal is so compelling that you find you must read it all in one sitting, and then go back and read it again. The book's organization, vignettes which are loosely chronological, keeps the pace lively. A powerful story about love and struggle, it's told with tenderness, humor, and great courage."
5,Worth Every Penny What you pay For,"I connected to Test this with Yam RXV663 along with POLK Audio R50 Main Channel to test it, through the supplied capacitor, sounded very good. Quality of the high frequency was very clear not tinny sound as most of the folks reported, am sure it is going to sound much better if conncted via proper x over network. Bought this as a Gift to my brother who was in need of a tweeter, will post comments after my brother does this."
5,An Excellent Adventure Story,"This was the first novel I remember reading on my own, perhaps in the fourth grade. When I had a child of my own I decided to seek it out and see if it was as good as I remembered it being nearly 40 years ago. It has really exceeded my expectations! As another reviewer stated, it has a wondefully evocative atmosphere and is a real page turner. It also does a great job of getting into the head of a young orphaned boy who finds himself in a new and rather frightening situation. I'm reading it to my 10 year old son and I'm enjoying it as much as he is. Highly recommended."
3,2gether's The Hardest Part of Breaking Up,"We live in a world of constant overload of media icons. The reigning icons of the moment are bubblegum pop groups like N'SYNC,Backstreet Boys,Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera,etc. The creator of 2gether(a fictitious boy band) have taken a cue from this current craze to give the people(mainly teenage girls)more of what they want. 2gether's resonant mockery of boy bands is practically flawless. They feature the heartthrob, the bad boy, the ingenue, the cute one and of course the venerable member of the group.Their new single the ""The Hardest Part of Breaking Up(Is Getting Back Your Stuff)"" is highly entertaining and comically true. Dealing with break ups are bad enough but getting your stuff back is even harder. For a good laugh, something fun to dance to or a song to relate post-breakup, listen to this song."
5,I LOVE 2GETHER!!!,"2GETHER'S 1ST SINGLE OFF THE ALBUM ""2GETHER AGIAN"" IS ""THE HARDEST PART OF BREAKING UP"" IS SO FUNNY. I WATCH THE VIDEO LAST NIGHT AND IT ROCKS 2GETHER IS SO CUTE (CHAD'S THE HOTTEST). THEY ARE THE BEST BOY BAND AROUND. GO 2GETHER!!!"
5,2gether roks!,"This is the best song out there! its a song you cant get tired of nd the band rocks! Chad is completely gorgeous and if you have no other reason to buy it, buy it because chad is on the cover = )"
1,again...not worth the postage paid,"This didn't work at all...not as a press...not as a cutter. It's a very lightweight, cheap, import and a waste of money. Luckily, Amazon came thru and refunded.I made ravioli and used both the square and the round press, both are offered by this company. I used 1.5 teaspoons of filling which still came out of the ravioli even though there was plenty of room around it. I tried both an egg wash and a water wash to hold the dough, pressing out all the air with my fingers and then used the press.It didn't work...not to press the dough and certainly not to cut. To give an indication of how poorly made this item is...when you sit the press on the counter...the metal doesn't touch all the way around the diameter. It rocks because it's not level. I reverted to the tried and true upside down drinking glass, with far better results."
3,ravioli the hard way,"We have the ravioli press and thought we would purchase this just for the extra scraps. It does what it is supposed to do, but I just don't find much use for it. It is well made for the price, so if this is what you are looking for, I would recommend."
2,Repetitive,"We own a lot of educational/entertaining software for kids. I bought this hoping it would be a step up from some of the Reader Rabbit and Jumpstart programs for Math. I was disappointed, as it is very repetitive and the ""story"" doesn't seem to tie together. My daughter played it once or twice, but hasn't been interested since. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The math is too difficult for the age that would find the games fun."
3,Mostly Okay,"My almost 6 year old enjoyed helping me navigate the puzzles the kids have to face, since he is a big fan of the TV program.We ran into a problem in the vampire mansion, however. There was not enough information given to sucessfully navigate this screen.Some of the challenges in this game were over the head of my Kindergartener. He was able to do one or two things by himself.I would not reccomend paying full retail price for this title. I think that the 8-11 year old crowd that it is recommended for would be bored."
2,LOUSY description -- what size are they?,Can't rate it because the size (length) is not given! I love the largest ones but can't tell if this is what I want!
4,Great mill - clogging problem solved!,"I bought this unit over a year ago and mechanically it worked great, however, I could never get it to grind properly without a lot of trouble. The other day I finally sat down and closely examined it to discover what the problem was.It seems that the little door flap that prevents the coffee grinds from spraying all over the house was miss designed, which caused a clog in the mill and prevented the grinds from coming out of it.I have since created a simple work around which acts as a spigot like on your hose bib outside (without the valve). It holds the door open and directs the grinds at a 90-degree angle into the receptacle. Now it works perfect, no mater what type of coffee beans I but into it. I am actually going to buy another one so I can have one for decaf and one for full strength.If you would like directions on how to create your own adapter or would like to buy one, just email me at rtaylor@salesforce-automation.net"
2,I would have liked it if it had worked,"I had to return this item twice because it was projectile grinding TWICE! Every time I went to grind coffee I had to wear a biohazard suit. It was mess. Nevertheless, KitchenAID took both back and replaced it with a grinder that worked. Thanks to KitchenAid my coffee has never tasted so good!!!"
2,Too high Maintanence,"I can not reccomend this grinder as 1) it has to be constantly cleaned (or it stops working) and the grinds end up all over your counter. There is no self contained collector, just a small glass cup that catches about 95% of the grinds when the piece is clean and much less after only one use. It's a mess and not so exceptional that it's worth the trouble.I'm going back to a unit that has a self contained grind collector. I'll save a fortune finally getting all the grinds to the coffee cup instead of the counter top!"
3,DVD has its moments,About 60 minutes of footage on this dvd. Compliation of 6 of Luke's other DVD's. Lot's of girl on girl action and several x-rated parts. Lot's of hot black women dancing and showing all. Quality and lighting of some of the footage is not very good. Also some of the women are not very hot.
5,Best book on Ayurveda I've ever read,"I picked up Essential Ayurveda on a whim at a natural foods store when I was really looking for something else. What attracted me was the simple recipes and the pleasant, conversational voice of the author. When I began reading it at home, I was so glad I had trusted my instincts! I have been interested in Ayurvedic diet for many years but felt it was complicated and hard to prepare. But this author shows how simple it can be--and very clearly illustrates how the loving, respectful, harmonic way of living with and caring for yourself flows through all of life--not just diet. A wonderful book. I think it's the last book I'll ever need in order to understand Ayurveda better. I also already have ""Heaven's Banquet,"" which the author recommends as a great source for balanced and healing recipes. Now I'll go back to that book with new eyes!"
1,Heard It Before,"I've heard this ""out"" kind of jazz before, but played in more a melodic way. I think guitarist Tim Ziesmer has spent too much time in his basement emulating Ben Monder and Bill Frisell licks when he should have been focusing on developing a unique composing and improvisational style.Unfortunately, this album falls flat when you have somebody not being themselves and trying to be something they're not. Let's not kid ourselves, there is only one Frisell and Monder.The band seems lost half the time, but that's to be expected when you have somebody who don't know what they want to do as a leader.If you want to hear ambient jazz guitar music played right pick up some Bill Frisell, Ben Monder, John Abercrombie, Terje Rypdal, Steve Tibbetts, and David Torn."
1,tmnt,The condition I bought was new. However the box was broken and the disc was damaged.In my opinion the rate out of 10 is only 1.
5,H.A.T.E.,"The DVD I got didn't look like the picture that's being showed to me now. But anyhow, these shows are great. This DVD is so popular I guess that it is so rare now, that when it is for sale, people have to pay a lot of money for it.But I had bought this DVD this time around for a very special friend who didn't have it and couldn't find it or afford it, so I helped her out. I already had bought my own copy back in '07. Still running good."
5,A winner!,"I looked for a textbook to use for a Bible study class that stepped outside the normal box we usually use. Everyday Life in Bible Times was the best I could find for a short term study that was very readable, interesting, informative, and made the Bible stories ""human"". Our class of 20 relish their copy of the book and will use it as a reference for future use. I really recommend this book for this kind of study.Everyday Life in Bible Times"
4,User Friendly,"The meter is very easy to use. The large digital display is nice. The microphone pickup is a bit sensitive to direction. The sound pickup openings are on the very tip of the probe, underneath the round foam wind screen, and facing in the direction of the long axis of the probe (think of looking through a paper towel roll). So if you tilt it slightly up, down, or to the side from a direct line-of-sight to the sound source you will get different readings. They could have made a more omni-directional pick up. Other than that I'd say it's a good meter for the price. Shipping was fast. I would buy it again as an entry-level meter."
4,It fits in your purse!,"I bought this product because I'm doing a masters thesis on acoustics/loudness in specific venues. I was looking for a product that was easy to use, fairly small, and easy to assemble. I found that I bought it at a great price and I have gotten a lot of use out of it. And ladies, it fits in a purse, which is great! It saves me the feeling of embarrassment from strangers when I am doing field work! This is a very compact product...not clunky at all. Perfect for on the go research/measurements"
3,Sinometer JTS1357,"I recently used the Sinometer JTS1357 to evaluate room noise caused by air handlers, which when running prevent reasonable conversation resulting from the noise. The sound level meter seemed to work but as others have commented, it shuts off automatically too quickly. My chief complaint is that the LCD readout is not back lit, making it difficult to see the data. The tripod mount threaded hole is handy. If the manufacturer would extend the ON time and backlight the display, the unit would get high marks."
2,DOA,"Can't really say much about this product as it didn't work. Followed all instructions and display read 120 db and never moved regardless of how much noise was present. No, the MAX setting was OFF. Product was returned for refund"
2,"Defective, not calibrated, or ??","I bought this particular meter because I wanted to test the noise levels of my air purifiers. One of them is AHAM tested at 23dB at its lowest setting. I was looking forward to an ""under"" warning. Instead it read 40dB. The air purifier is rated at 40dB for its medium speed. The meter displayed 52dB at 6 feet. I turned off all noise generation in the room; dead silent. It still read 40dB."
2,LED screen defective,"Sound meter works.But LED screen cuts off top of readout.Holding gentle finger pressure on the screen makes it work, but have to maintain finger pressure.Returning meter.Would give it 5 stars if the LED screen worked properly."
2,No short cuts here,This book still goes into the who's and why's of KABBALAH.There is nothing Modern about this book.I thought that maybe it would go into more of the Kabbalah Magic but instead it gives you lessons on Kabbalah.If you are looking into Kabbalah Magic try something else by another author.
3,For my son,My son like the justice lords story line.these arrive in new condition excellent value for my money the shipping was more or equal to the price of the toys.But like I said excellent value I wish I can find all of them this good.I also wish the whole team was sold as a set.
1,I was so sorry I had bought this book...,because it`s very far from the marvelous and classic legends of my Country...
5,A life-saving publication,"Following the advice in Dr. Bob's Trans Fat Survival Guide isn't always easy, but the resulting increased energy, enhanced mental awareness, and reduced pain makes it very worthwhile. Dr. Bob DeMaria not only tells you the ""do's and don't's"" of a healthy diet and lifestyle, he explains why in detail. I don't feel like I'm exaggerating when I say that this book can literally save a reader's life if he or she follows the advice in it."
1,"Product listed as new, but was used","Product listed as new, but was used. Box was ripped (probably from when it was FIRST opened) and taped back together. Inside box, the origanal Reader Rabbit sleeves were missing. All three disks were shoved into a used plain white sleeve, and they didn't even try to face one of the disks through the window. Watch for items listed as New."
1,Too Wordy,This story could have been told chronologically in 100 pages or less as a BET Arabesque novel. I did not like the way it jumped back and forth from the past to the present. I lost interest very quickly.
4,Cute Easy Read (I listened to the audio book),"This was a cute story about childhood best friends becoming lovers. It was light listening, the actors did a good job performing the book, and I laughed several times. Easily something to listen or read by the beach or on the plane."
4,not sleek but genuine lovable sexy,"The models are not sleek fashion models on a modern couch. They are not sexy in the way a sports car is considered but more like the comfortable, worn, brown vinyl sofa that pops up throughout the book.The predominant feel is of skin and the beautiful hairs and colors that are noticed when in a sensual, engaged state. The photos may move anywhere on the body but never feel like the bare naked exposure of pornography. I found this book refreshing. Artful but not in the tired, traditional ""ART"" black and white erotic photography way.The best sexy images I've seen in a while. The only criticism is that, for an unusual book, the models were of the body type and age of most models in fashion magazines. The women are no doubt beautiful but the same beauty could be found in models of other ages and shapes - maybe in a sequel to Sofasexy."
2,"puzzle pieces, one per page","It's a little collection of flash-on-camera closeups. Some of them have that accidental-snapshot charm. The cover photo is by far the most engaging. Perhaps the pictures could be cut out of the book and assembled into a Hockney-esque collage of a famous model. Not much money, not very well spent, in sum."
1,Not thrilled,"When I read the editorial review for this book, I was really excited. I really have liked the editorial stuff that Rankin has done for a variety of different publications, but this book is really not at all what he's capable of. When the editiorial review stated, ""some of the sexiest models and glamour girls participated in this project"", I had to laugh. While they maybe top models, when you see the photos, the models are not made up to be sexy or glamorous, despite the closeups of cleavage and body parts. If you think what you are receiving is a book of full body glamour shots of sexy models on the retro sofa, please reconsider. What you get is a lot of closeup shots of body parts instead. Sorry Mr. Rankin but you are way better than this."
5,Wonderfully funny! Great 'insight' to life in the womb!,"I have a copy of both 'Eggbert' and 'Eggbert & Eggberta', and we read them everytime my wife is expecting. They never stop bringing the laughs. I remember reading them at my grandmom's when I was little (before I was supposed to be reading them, I'm sure)!!Wonderful reading, everytime."
5,a great book,The book is really interesting and easy to read. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in applied linguistics.
4,a worthwhile read,good for history buffs who do not care for the glorification of revisionist native stories
3,"Good basic introduction, but little else.","I am a games programmer who was wanting to get better understanding of some artificial intelligence applications and theory. This book provided a reasonable introduction, but very little more than I had picked up from my own experience. Search algorithms, State spaces, goal oriented planning and all the basics are covered, but it doesn't go much farther from there. If you know NOTHING about AI it could be a useful addition to your library, but if you're even a novice like myself with introductory understanding it probably won't offer you anything new."
1,Not good for beginers,Not good for an introduction for AI.Not at all student friendly as the language used in the book is hard to comprehend and understand in one go.Don't buy this and even you get this book free don't take it
4,Magical,"This was the second Tarot deck I owned, the first being the Rider-Waite deck. It's much less morbid and creepy than the Rider-Waite, which is what I was looking for when I brought them.The artwork on each card is gorgeous and magical. There's something very comforting about these cards. Each card of the major arcana depicts a different Goddess originating from all over the world. I love how the artist expertly captured the essence of each Goddess in the work, it's what drew me to the deck in the first place.I don't use them very much anymore, since I found other decks with which I work better, but I still pull these out to look at them once in a while."
4,An interesting and pretty cool deck,"I liked the artwork on this deck. The cards are a bit unusual size to handle, but nothing that couldn't be overcome. The artwork is unique and rather nice, not artifical in any way and rather natural. This is a very positive deck with the LBW and even it's companion book with a very positive spin oon the meaning of the cards. Now the majors are a little unusual as they aren't your typical Major Arcana, but the do work and are refreshingly differant then most decks. I really didn't get the ""Path of the Goddess"" stuff all that well, but it didn't bother me as that had no real bearing on readings or just sharing cards. The minors are the usual fair, but with very differant artwork and style. The court cards are slightly differant an almost natural feel to the artwork. I do like this deck and would use it to give readings to females. If you can find the companion book, it would be a good investmeant."
5,Deck lovers favorite,"As a avid deck lover, this deck rules. It is gorgeous. It is easy to use to give readings and the booklet explains a lot. Anyone who loves Goddesses or reveres them will appreciate this deck. Suddenly the divine seems so accessible.The Major Arcana is 0. Beginnings-Tara,1. Magic-Isis,2. Wisdom-Saraswati,3.Fertility-Estsanatlehi,4 Power-Freyja,5.Tradition-Juno,6.Love-Venus7. Movement-Rhiannon,8.Justice-Athena,9.Contemplation-Chang O,10. Fortune-Lakshmi,11.Strength-Oya,12.Sacrifice-Kuan Yin,13.Transformation-Ukemochi,14. Balance-Yemana,15. Temptation-Nyai Loro Kidul,16.Oppression-Wawalak,17.The Star-Inanna,18.The Moon-Diana,19. The Sun-The Zorya,20. Judgment-Gwenhwyfar21. The World-GaiaAfter thinking about, I realize this deck is so successful because of the goddesses she chose to portray the major arcana and the pictures accompanying it. The interpretations are cleverly done and well thought out. I recommend it to anyone."
4,Magnificent deck,"It may not be my favourite, but I have fallen in love with the Goddess tarot deck. The artwork is beautiful and powerful, the meanings empowering, and all in all is a wonderful deck to use for self-empowerment. I especially enjoy the inclusion of Freyja, one of the Goddesses I work with a lot. My only complaint is that the cards are very wide and those with small hands will not handle that well, and that is why I have taken off one star. If you enjoy beauty, do yourself a favour and purchase this deck. It may help you tremondously in the long run."
5,My first deck,this is my first tarot deck and I would recommend it to a beginner or someone more advanced. It talks about all the cards and explains all the spreads (and how to do them.) It is a fun deck with great pictures!
3,"Beautiful, but I cannot use it.","Card imagery is very beautiful.But since my memory is old, remembering a total different story pains me.And I also cannot connect with this deck sadly. Perhaps because of the pastel colours of every card, I can't really feel anything different.I have done readings with this card. After looking up the LWB, I find they are accurate and practical. They tend not like other tarot cards to give you unexpected insights, they focus on giving advice like how to solve problem. A usable tarot for the practicals, but not for personal growth."
5,goddess tarot review,"I have been collecting tarot decks for a couple years now, and have more than a dozen decks I use regularly. The Goddess Tarot is a kinder, gentler deck than most. While I have had very accurate readings with others, when I read for myself, I find very depressing outcomes. Not so with the Goddess deck, as others have mentioned, it points towards reasons why things are the way they are, instead of beating one over the head with what the problem is. I found this very condusive to meditation, and found some very satisfactory answers, to some very thorny problems in my life. I would very highly recommed this deck for those with some experience reading cards. Wonderful addition to any collection. Beautiful artwork is a plus!!!Old Goat"
2,So-so deck,"Is it just me? Sure, the art is good. Sure, we need Goddess depictions. But, I found the deck curiously lacking in any kind of traditional tarot symbolism that would clue the reader in to the various interpretations of the card. If you've memorized the goddesses and know what they stand for, you are in good shape. A beginner, however, won't derive much benefit from this deck. Pretty pictures may go a long way for some, but symbolism is at the heart of the tarot. I like a little more meat with my veggies."
3,The Goddess Tarot Deck,"The artwork is beautiful. The thing I didn't like about the cards is that most of the Major Arcana cards have different names. To someone who is new to Tarot, it makes reading the cards a bit trickier. For example, instead of ""The Fool"" this deck has ""Beginnings"". Some may find these cards easier to read, others may find it more difficult... depending on whether or not you are learning the Tarot from books/guides or from intuition."
5,Excellent!,"Hard-to find album, was in great condition. This was a gift for my dad. This made him very happy. Thanks!"
3,Not exactly what I expected...,"When I saw the Scholastic label on the movie I was quick to think that this movie would be great for my three daughters.We popped it into the DVD player and I was automatically very disappointed. Maybe all Scholastic movies are like this, but with this being our first, I had no idea that it wasn't animated. It was like a story was being read--just pages of a book with the words on the bottom.If your children are a little older perhaps this would be more interesting. But for my 4 year old and 2 year old? No way. They were over this movie within minutes."
2,Containing some obvious errors,"The book contains some obvious errors. For example, when describing dynamic programming, the recursive formula is wrong. Another example is on P.162, where it is said that the KA/KS ratio exceeds 100 for conservative genes.In general, the book briefly touches on a lot of topics. While the book is meant to serve an introductory purpose, some details necessary for understanding the concepts are missing."
4,Good product,"Good price.This book was originally advertised as ""like new"". Right after the purchase, the seller notified me about some highlights on the 1st chapter of the book and I requested a 20% discount that was immediately accepted by the seller. After arrival, I noticed that not one but two chapters were highlighted and the external appearance wasn't ""like new"". The discount was fine and a good deal but they should have been more accurate on the original ad."
1,Faith in McCrone: McCroneianity,"Science, properly understood, means proving a hyphothesis and having that proof replicated by one's peers. This was not done with McCrone's ""proof"" obtained only by McCrone using his ""instruments"". No verification by reputable laboratories equals taking McCrone's ""proof"" as a matter of faith ..........in McCrone. A fool's choice."
1,Broke after first use,This amplifier stopped working after the first use. To return it for repair on warranty would have cost almost as much as the item cost. I was disappointed. Save your money and buy a better system.
2,PA Amp,Pyramid PA105 Amplifier With Microphone Input (80-Watt) This is not a useful product for me.The talk over does not allow you to use it to perform because when you have a cd player hooked up or any other input the talk over shuts the music down where you can't hear itAlso it has no kind of eq and the tone knob doesn't do much
3,Good book but missing some of Toby Crabel's meat,"James Altucher comes closest to describing some good trading strategies.However, you still need to know the fundamentals of trading taught by Toby Crabel or Linda Raschke. A good book."
4,I will keep it for reference,"I liked this book because the author offers creative, original trading ideas. I plan to keep it as a reference, which is more than I can say for most books on the subject. Maybe the readers who didn't like the book were expecting the author to do their thinking for them."
3,For Beginner,"Bought this book in anticipation of fresh ideas. For the beginner this is a great way to get the mind flowing with new thoughts.Personally I didn't find that it sparked anything new for me. But what doesn't work for some may work for others. If your a seasoned trader I wouldn't get it, but if you are a beginner I would order it right now."
4,Focused Strategies for Gaming Institutions and Retail,"This is not a book about how to pick the next MSFT, or how to be a master of the Universe. It outlines several strategies by which traders can make money from1. Panic2. Slippage as the result of institutional biasesThere is not a lot of detail about risk management, back testing crietria, optimized bet sizes etc. - the author dismisses a lot of The Street's ""curve fitting"" and over-rationalization through numbers. The basics of how to run your own book - that is for you to figure out. What this book does is demonstrate how one trader - who makes a living from it - thinks and tries to game his opponents.As for the opinion that Mr. Altucher is not running a hugely successful fund (in AUM terms), that seems to be the case. But then again, he seems more intent on being an asset MANAGER, rather than an asset ACQUIRER, which is what most >$5bn HFs are now.Give this book a read - it will give you IDEAS, not a roadmap."
1,Statistically invalid strategies,"Most of these strategies do not forward-test very well; the results are based on small sample sizes. If these strategies were so great, then I would expect that the author would be running a hugely successful hedge fund, which is not the case. If you want to ""trade like a hedge fund"", then you must have access to the best information flow and awesome number-crunching power at funds such as Renaissance, SAC, and Citadel. Being in the hedge fund business, no truly successful hedge fund trades this, or for that matter even has time to write a book about it."
2,Don't believe the hype,"Pros:1. The text was clearly written and would be easily understood by anyone with a basic grasp of technical analysis.2. Mr. Altucher presents some well-researched and back tested trading strategies that a trader could easily adapt and include in his trading plan.Cons:1. I really thought that the title was misleading. While there were roughly 20 chapters in the book, several of the chapters detailed a strategy, then showed it to be statistically unsuccessful in practice.2. The author could have spent more time on the strategies that were shown to be statistically useful, as opposed to strategies that averaged less than 1% returns or losses.Had I purchased this book, I would have been quite disappointed. Since I borrowed it from the library, I did feel that i learned from it and reading it was worth my time. I would not purchase it for my personal library, nor would I recommend it for a new trader."
4,Trading Strategies Simplified,Clear understandable look into Hedge Fund strategies and how they work. Altucher's writing style is straightforward and helps you understand the concepts.
1,A disappointment,"I am very disappointed after reading this book. The so call ""20 strategies"" are nothing but pre-school materials. If any body can calls ""Buying when price touches the lower Bollinger Band"" a strategy is simply just joking to himself."
5,uplifting and grounding,"The essays in Earth Bound are often paradoxical. They manage to be uplifting and grounding at the same time. I like to read them in the morning, before I start my day. Nelson alerts us to a fact that I find useful to remember: One can't transcend physical limitations until one acknowledges--and embraces--those limitations. ""We are all products of nature,"" Nelson writes, ""Now is our time to honor, rather than condemn, our bond with the planet."""
3,Wishing there was a little more info. on getting the correct size,"I bought 2 of these caps for my kids (ages 10 & 8). They both have naturally bleach blonde hair & pool water turns it green everytime. We have tried all the creams and shampoos out there and was finally at my wits end when I bought these caps. I was disapointed that even after the ten mins. it took to get the cap on and adjusted right that it still let water in...& my kids still ended up looking like punk rockers with green streaks in their hair. On the other hand, it did keep the water out of thier ears & for the first time they didn't complain about swimmer's ear."
4,"Good fit, easy to get on","Easy to put on my child's head: We bought it so we didn't have to put elastic bands in my child's hair that pull the hair when getting them out of wet hair. The cap does not keep the hair from getting wet, it just isn't as wet and we don't have to tie her hair up with anything else. It is easy to get off and on."
2,Too small,"The cap didn't fit down over my 12 year old's head very far and squeezed his head so tight he couldn't stand to wear it for more than a few minutes. Granted, he did inherit my big head, but I would skip the junior size and go right to adult if I had to do it over again."
3,Runs small,I bought this for a birthday party my daughter attended where bathing caps were required. She is 6 years old and has long curly hair. It kept popping off because it was so tight.
2,Way too small,"My daughter is only 4 years old and her head circumference is at about 25%, which translates to the average head size of a 3-year-old. The swimming cap was way too small and gave her headache. It should be called ""infant"" rather than ""junior"" swimming cap. To give it some credit, the material feels nice and the color matches that on the screen. However, it may only work for a doll."
4,too tight even on a small head,Found this to be tight even on my 5 yr old's head. had to pull through his head. I find the TYR lycra caps to be better than the silicone ones.
4,Gebirgsjaeger in Action!,"Gebirgsjaeger in Action!Still today, this book ""Alpine Elite: German Mountain Troops of World War II"" by James Lucas is one of the best English Language sources on the German mountain divisions of WWII. Based on extensive research and interviews with some 200 former members of the Gebirgsjaeger, the book provides both a stirring narrative of the exploits of the mountain units and a wealth of information on their equipment, organization, and tactics. It is an indispensable reference for persons interested in combat in mountainous terrain."
3,pitcher,"This pitcher will not seal for storage in frig and i don't like that lacking feature. otherwise the looks, etc are super just don't care for the fact that you can't close for storage."
4,My daughter LOVES this!,"Winx Club is my 6 year old's favorite show, and she has started saving every penny she can get her hands on to buy up the DVD's. This is a great DVD with 5 episodes. Winx Club products tend to be on the expensive side, but thankfully the DVD's are pretty reasnably priced."
4,"Winx Club, Vol.3- Bloom's Secret Past","The greatest part of this DVD is that you get to know Bloom's past. Although it's a little sad, which is unusuall for the Winx Club. Kepp up the great work."
3,Fun times.,"This is a fun disc to have if you are a big fan of the Disney parks.Some of the perks of this CD is that if you're on a ride at Disney often times you don't really listen to the song because you're on the ride. But this is great because you can hear what the song actually is!Favorites include: Main Street Electrical Parade, Yo Ho, Maple Leaf Rag and Grim Grinning Ghosts (from the Haunted Mansion).A good buy for Disney lovers!"
2,Sounds Like Violence.....sounds great,"Another awsome band from the good people at Deep Elm. Sounds Like Violence hail from Sweden and represent their country well. Grittily sung, sometimes shouted, lyrics with an almost sad, but frustrated undertone. I cant quite compair SLV to any other band I've heard....but I'll try. Picture early (EARLY) Cure meets My Chemical Romance with just a touch of heavyieness. Awsome heartfelt words meshing wonderfully with emotionally played instruments...pick this one up NOW, you wont be dissapointed."
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"Ok so here's how dance music typically goes:The artist makes a standout, kick-butt single that floods compilations and dance floors. They may do it up to 3 more times, but they'll release an album eventually. And the album...will leave something to be desired. As good as acts like Angel City, Iio, and Deepest Blue are concerning singles and mix additions, their albums are less than stellar. More like...filler.David Guetta, however, has a stunning little album on his hands here. His lyrics may be repetetive (one verse, sung a bunch of times with a chorus interjected) but the vocalists are great and the music is extremely engaging. And despite the repetition, the lyrics still remain somewhat poignant and relevant.The music is flooded with 80's influences. The beats aren't overpowering and the little intricacies within the melodies and harmonies and beats are interesting to listen to and increase the overall enjoyability of the album.You just can't go wrong here. Wonderful stuff."
1,samples don't work with Avid Xpress DV 4.6,"The book jacket says that the book's DVD-ROM will work with Xpress DV 3.0 and higher. The .omf video files were compressed at 20:1 using Media Composer and Xpress DV 4.6 does not support the 20:1 resolution, meaning that the sample video files cannot be imported and used in Xpress DV 4.6. This is a shame, because it seems like a good book and this is not really a problem that the author could have foreseen. Unfortunately, most places won't let you return a book after the DVD has been opened, so let this be a warning, FYI. Hopefully the upcoming 3rd edition will fix this problem."
5,Simply Incredible!,"I can not ""truly"" put into words how great this book is written. Sam Kauffmann not only shows you the tools in the AVID system, but with ""every"" tool gives you the reason and purpose for it. Unlike other manuals, you really feel that you have grasped the concepts for each chapter before moving on. I am working efficiently, intelligently, and creatively in Avid because of this book. Sam Kauffmann is a professor at Boston University, and after reading this book I can honestly say if I were a student at BU...I would never skip his class! Simple Incredible!"
1,He must pay for good reviews,I purchased this book for my son based on the reviews. My son does have some editing experience. When he complained I reviewed the book and decided to work with my son to get through the book. We then sold it on Ebay.They guy that wrote the book spends to much time bad mouthing the software program. He also fills the book with little cutzies that are stupid and a waste of space.Most of what is written can be outlined and accomplished in about 30% of the space that he uses.I dropped the book from out production facility in Ventura and Tucson.
5,FRAGRANCE,THEY ARE GOOD. GREAT FRAGRANCE AND EASY TO CARRY ON YOUR PERSON.I WILL BUY MORE. THEY ARE PRICED JUST A BIT HIGH THOUGH..
1,Disliked it very much,"The music ruined it for me. The modern music already sounds dated and was stupid when it was new. Also, the settings and costumes weren't right, they were not accurate. I felt the BBC was working too hard to be modern and relate to a younger audience, which isn't interested anyway. The color was drained out of this production, dark and dreary, says I."
4,I am giving this production 4 stars instead,"of 5, because I thought it could have been longer and given more justiceto some pretty critical aspects of Elizabeth I's reign. Aside from that it is pretty well done. And to those who gripe about Ann-Marie Duff's ""middle class"" accent, I say, get over yourselves.If you are really concerned about authenticity, you should know that, 1) the accent of the Elizabethan Britons resembled the accent of the American south much more than the upper class or even lower class or middle class British accents of today and 2) at that time there was no universal ""upper class"" accent, all accents were regional with little or no class distinction inherent in them. It took the establishment of the British ""public schools"" for the current ""posh"" accent to come into use. If you don't believe me, go look it up."
2,Anachronistic blend of history and modernity,"Although I normally enjoy period pieces, especially Masterpiece Theatre programs, I could not get into this production.I found the modernized soundtrack and fast-cut video editing to be distracting and offputting. Many of the characters frankly looked too ""modern"" to be believable, particularly Tom Hardy who would have been more suited to a street gang film.I am an older viewer, so this may very well have affected my response to the film, which seemed geared to a more youthful audience.Production values, of course, were high and lent the film a sumptious air but it ended up being little more than eye candy.I've seen so many other, better, Elizabeths, that I cannot recommend this one. Obviously, I'm in the minority, but that's nothing new for me. I have, let us say, oddball tastes!"
2,disappointed,I found this production dreary and uninspired. The soundtrack was extremely unpleasant and distracting.
2,"Elizabeth was strong, here she is very weak","I agree with other reviewers that Glenda Jackson's portrayal of Elizabeth inElizabeth RIS THE DEFINITIVE portrayal of the Virgin Queen. I think ""modernizing"" history and dumbing down historical accuracy is a real shame. It shows such a lack of imagination and desire to connect with people and events in the past. Although this treatment is not as egregious as the Italian mafiosa version of Elizabeth's court in other ""modern"" versions, the only thing I did find interesting was Tom Hardy's very earthy portrayal of Dudley.Why are so many modern treatments of Elizabeth trying to weaken her so very badly?Skip this (or at least correct your understanding of the complexity of Elizabeth's cunning and character) and rent or buy Elizabeth R. Superb treatment and a real window on history."
5,The most true movie I have seen,I have watched several movies and read several books on Queen Elizabeth and this is by far the most accurate movie available. Although I love all movies about Queen Elizabeth I have found this one to be the most historicaly correct.
2,Glitchy,"When you try to take the tests, the scroll button wont work right away when you click on it but your time will still keep ticking down... and i have a very good computer, its frustrating, the time ticks down at least a few seconds before the scroll actually goes down, and it might go to far then it'll take more seconds to go back up. It just is very laggy when i took it... and now i am abandoning it... dont buy it."
5,Excellent Product,"I recieved mine yesterday and am very pleased! They have TONS of information on both the ACT and SAT (two separate disks) including lessons and test strategies, drills, and four full length tests that provide full length solutions. They also analyze your results and give you suggestions on what to work on."
2,"OK, but same as 2003","its a good product for average students.if u r looking for a very high score, its not too effective.its also almost exactly the same as last years version.in addition, the quality could be better in that in looks really old and uses old video lessons. looks like mid-90s if u look at their clothes."
5,Princeton Review 2004 CD,"Great Deal, shipped quickly. I did not purchase the entire package just a loose CD. Thanks for the option. It saved a lot of money and was great."
3,a very good workout almost ruined by production quality,What can I say about this good and tough workout except for its a bit hard to look at.Tracey deserves better!!!
5,Another amazing FitPrime!,"Anna Benson has done it again! This workout is amazing, and really does work your whole body, esp. your legs. New moves that are fun, and actually make you smile while doing them! Tracie Long is a personal favorite, and her cuing is probably the best yet! The background is better than ever, not as cluttered as in the past. No ball, which some will love, and Tracie tells you exactly which poundage she is using. I highly recommend this to anyone with a FIRM/FitPrime background. Newbies will need to lower poundage, it is tough!"
3,Little Sister,"From the cover: Amid the beauty and terror of the jungle a lovely young woman learns the secret of her own heart.Little Sister was the name the natives gave to their golden haired nurse, Linda Dale. But to the men who witnessed her selfless devotion to the sick and diseased, she was a beautiful woman... Joel Starling offered her fun and gaiety. Martin Parks offered her the more subtle pleasures of the mind. Only when Linda was struck down by a jungle fever did she realize her choice was a much deeper one - between her beloved vocation and her woman's heart."
2,Probably best suited for 10 year old boys,This book contains very easy folds for kids (which to be fair is the target audiance). I'm sure young boys would delight in it! The front cover gives a good representation of what is inside.
5,"Finally, a readable, informative guide to MCI","I am pleased to strongly recommend Paul and Hank's book on the organization, deployment and administration of mass causuality incidents. This book is head and shoulders above what has previously been out in the EMS/Public Safety world for handling disasters. It is an excellent combination of academic education with real world scenarios as examples of application of the principles set forth. The chapter on the World Trade Center explosion was both gripping and an awesome learning tool for the future."
5,Great manual for all emergency responders,This is a wonderful reference and operational manual. Cristen and Maniscalco have painstakingly taken the steps required to present this material NEEDED to understand managing these events while remembering that in the heat of battle an operational reference is a handy book to have at arms length. This manual satisfys both requirements.
4,reckless and wild,"when I first saw this it was desperate but not serious.. but seriously a fun movie.. got lost in the mainstream, but a fun movies with bit parts played by notable b listers.."
4,Coin Reference,"A nice reference for collectors of Philippine coins minted during the American administration of the Philippine Islands, 1903-1946. Although coin values are dated, the history and detail of the coins is what gives this book value. Recommend one be added to your library or available to you during collection of Philippine coins. Current valuation and additional information obtainable using ""US/Philippine Coins"" by Lyman L. Allen, 6th Ed 2008-9."
3,Facts About This Book,"Author's name is NOT John Barrymore Jr. It was written in 1925 by John Sidney Blyth Barrymore (1882-1942), son of Maurice Barrymore and Georgiana Drew, shortly after he played Hamlet in London, and before he met and married his third wife, Delores Costello. This book is a very small collection of very short stories about his life up to that point, with a few photos, and the book's pages are not numbered. It is more a collectors item than a real autobiography or resource for detailed information on the actor, the man, the myth, the legend, ""The Great Profile."""
3,Gift for a nephew,"The software arrived on time and as advertised. Since this was a gift for a nephew for Christmas, I have not yet received any feedback as to how helpful the Math program is for a third grader."
4,Great software,"I bought this for my 8-year-old to spend more time practicing math. My son likes math and he likes playing this software. He asks to play it rather than needing to be prodded, as he was with the Math & Science Excelerator I bought for the same purpose. Even the neighborhood kids come to play it with him. I would also recommend it for kids having trouble with math as it puts the concepts into visual perspective, rather than just repeating equations."
5,Martdar,Great educational tool- it is a game- but it really is an educational aide. Excellent math activities..
5,Great software and highly recommended.,This one is a homerun with my nine-year-old son. He loves this software. The characters and story line are so appealing to the age ranges on the product that you almost forget that you are learning math too! I am extremely pleased with this software.
3,Valves wear out quickly,The product is good if you don't need to adjust the valves a lot. The plastic wears out quickly especially from accidental tightening. The metal lever 3 way valve by Hagen works a lot better and is easier to adjust.
1,not worth the money,i bought this to split between two bet ta tanks .i attached it and turned the first valve which was very hard but it work .the second valve would not turn the top piece came off i put it back finally got it to turn no bubbles same with the third. save your money don't buy
4,"A different, yet strong showing from Metric","I know it's a lot different from what Metric usually does (leading to the odd release of it, even though it was one of their earlier works), but the music flows really well and I listen to it just as often as I listen to other albums like Fantasies, Synthetica, Live it Out, etc. If you like the band, or even just Emily Haines, it's a worthwhile album to get."
3,Clifford the Big Red Dog: Phonics,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas this year. It was the first computer learning game she ever tried and it has been great in teaching her the basic mechanics for moving the cursor around the computer screen and using a mouse. But now, just 3 months later, I find that she is bored with the game. There are only a handful of games at the carnival to play. She seems more interested in decorating the float with the prizes she's won from these games instead."
2,May not be what you think it is.,"This came up when I searched Amazon for compressed air cleaners for electronic products, but it is NOT compressed air. When they say cleaner, they mean cleaner--as in spray on, not through a straw but like wood furniture polish, and wipe off with a cloth. If you're looking for basic canned air cleaners, this is not some new-and-improved version that's anti-static. This is canned spray-on liquid, not canned air."
2,not satisfied,"The product can be goo for what it was made, but I was expecting a dust can, so it was pretty upsetting when I saw that this was just a cleaner. I cannot use it for what I wanted and I cannot return it either"
2,I Think a Better Title & Synopsis would have done this book Wonders,"The book version I read was 219 pages long...Though the apple doesn't fall far from the tree in this family, the writing is rather dull. Until perhaps the last 30 or 40 pages, does this story become more intriguing. And unfortunately, by the last couple of pages, you pretty much know how it's going to end..."
3,"A decent read, but something's off....","If you're thinking about purchasing this book, please do. It's totally worth the read. I had some minor issues with it though. My problem though.... I watched the movie first. The book and the movie are TOTALLY different from each other. There were some similarities between the book and the movie, but not many. For one, the setting was different, the storyline in general was different, and the ultimate outcome was insanely different. As for the book itself, I found the dialogue to be sometimes a bit overdramtic in some conversations and then not dramtic enough in others, particularly when it mattered. Other than that, the story is well crafted and the characters are pretty believable; some more than others really. Anyway, I recommend the book to read at least once. It's pretty good."
4,Humanities in Western Culture,"It is so exactly about the same as brand new, there's no difference and the amazon were a better deal than purchasing at the book store at any college that offers much higher!!!I would want to purchase the books from Amazon again in the future!..."
3,Intense and realistic.,"After 18 years of marriage and a child conceived before marriage, Elizabeth Sinclair wanted a divorce. She feels lost, unhappy. Donovan Sinclair has been so involved with his work that he seems a stranger to Beth. Once they separate, Beth can't seem to trust Donovan or herself to reunite.Beth is somewhat selfish, but her friends call her on it and she tries to get past it. The teenage marriage explains her need for freedom and the taste of another life. A bit abrupt in the ending."
5,Excellent product,"This toy has a great quality, my son is very happy with this product. i recommend also the seller cause i got it pretty fast without any problem."
4,Good overview of the basic ideas,"The New Turing Omnibus is a gentle pass over many of the abstract concepts of computer science. It focuses on concepts, so if you want to learn to program in a given language, or if you want to master your Windows or Linux OS, look elsewhere. However, it does review all of the theoretical matters, from automata to logic maps, algorithmic analysis and beyond. It is a great read for a budding Computer Scientist, Electrical Engineer or Mathematician. Ideal readers would be younger students in Math or CompSci who want a gentle introduction to the real underlying concepts that govern all of Computer Science. Definatly a must for all CompSci book shelves."
5,"66 Concise, Witty Excursions in Computer Science...","If, as according to A. K. Dewdney, ""W. Rouse Bell (was) the great English writer on mathematical recreations"" thenDewdney is the greatest Canadian writer.Period."
4,OmniBus: The only way to fly.,"If you are a geek like me or want to be an armchair geek for an hour or so at a time, then this is the book for you. I loved it and I still reread some the chapters from time to time.It is not only good for you but it's tasty too! :)-- smerkdaddy"
5,Are you studying implementation of Electronic Medical Records systems? Buy this book.,"A very good book. Covers non-technical aspects of implementation, such as project management, team-building, change management, the importance of buy-in and having a physician champion. Written in 2005. I wish there were a more recent edition.The book probably tells you a lot of things that you've already learned in your classwork concerning implementation of EMRs, but it's nice to have this book in such a clean, concise format, rather than reviewing your own crummy notes."
2,I really wanted to like it...,"Thank You for smoking is one of my favorite books, so I had high hopes for this book. These hopes were dashed in the first 40 pages, as I found the characters unappealing and storyline boring. In keeping with my protocol of cutting my losses after the first 40 boring pages of fiction (or 15min in movies), I put the book down, got on the computer, and wrote this review as a warning to others. Get it from the Library if you must."
2,Thud of an ending,"The main theme of the soon-to-be crushing expense of senior citizen entitlements is certainly relevant today and I found his over the top play on it an engaging and funny. Ditto on his portrayal of how Washington DC works behind the scenes, though I certainly hope it's closer to fiction than reality. Most of the characters are interesting and never are lacking a witty retort.The story moved at a good pace and, as I approached the ending of the book, things were moving along ... and then all of a sudden - epilogue. Pardon me?Another reviewer noted that epilogues are usually a writer's away of wrapping up without having to write a decent ending, and I definitely concur. The rushed ending left me feeling somewhat cheated out of the proper ending I deserved - an unfortunate way to end what was a entertaining read."
2,Boomsday Review,"I personally did not enjoy this book. I read the first half, was bored by the predictable characters, andskimmed the ending. I might have enjoyed it more if I had checked it out from the library, saving myselfthe purchase price, though I probably would just have returned it early."
4,I LOVE REBELS LIKE CASSANDRA DEVINE,"Boomsday is a drop dead funny look at one rebellous blogger, Cassandra Devine, and our current dysfunctional Social Security system. Cassandra's solution is simple: Give Baby Boomers government incentives to kill themselves by age seventy-five. Why should that upset anyone? If her father had not blown her Yale tuition on a dot.com start-up, she would've never wound up having sex in a minefield with a U.S. Congressman to begin with. Okay, so she has some anger issues...This book reminds me of Evelyn Waugh's irreverent book The Loved One, also (recommend). Buckley is hilarious!"
4,"Clever, funny, timely, satisfying","Jason Reitman's brilliant ""Thank you for Smoking"" elevated Christopher Buckley's humor to the mainstream. If you enjoy political satire, this book is tremendously fun. Cassandra Devine, an intrepid 20 something blogger creates a national stir when she throws down the generational gauntlet and challenges boomers to ""voluntarily transition"" at the age of 70. Buckley does a great job setting up Cassandra's back story. Her character's motivation is clearly established and helps to anchor this absurd but increasingly plausible solution to the social security crisis. I thought the book had some weaknesses regarding the plot but the point of the narrative arc is not the arc, but following the spin and in this area Buckley succeeds tremendously. I plan to read all of his books. I laughed the whole weekend over Boomsday. Recommend!"
3,satire... but it kind of creeped me out...,"I listened to the unabridged CDs.Given the governmental bailout and takeover of the financial and automotive industries along with taking control of the tobacco industry... As well as the absurd dilution of the dollar... and the indication of yet another costly stimulus package in the works the premise of this book went from satirical to prophetical. And as much as I began enjoying the listen it quickly began to creep me out. I can actually envision this or something similar happening.However, for my hourly commute it was definitely worth the listen."
4,If you like Buckley... but it's no Thank You For Smoking,"I have read every Christopher Buckley novel since Thank You For Smoking. None approach it. But if you like Buckley, by all means, read Boomsday. It is enjoyable. But while I turned dozens of people to Thank You For Smoking, I probably won't do the same for Boomsday."
2,Disappointing,"Great idea for a story, a few clever plot twists, a little bit of humor, mostly a vehicle for gratuitous profanity. SKIP IT!"
1,FORGET IT!,"I was expecting something along the lines of Sinclair Lewis' ""It Can't Happen Here"". IT ISN'T. At the least I was hoping for something funny. IT ISN'T. Life is too short to spend time reading dull, absurd books. THIS IS!! Don't buy it. Don't borrow it!"
1,Any daughter will do,"I got as far as Page 8, where Buckley explains that Clytemnestra kills her husband in revenge for sacrificing his daughter Electra. There are different versions about what happened to Iphigeneia, but I never heard that Electra had been substituted. There seemed little reason to read further."
3,Middle of the road for Buckley,"There are two things you can always count on from Mr. Buckley: spot on political satires and unlikely but thought provoking plots.This book follows Buckley's standard formula: A heroine who is up against the higher ups in DC who has a flawed hero with a heart of gold helping her out. Surround with outrageous caricatures and crazy situations, and let the reader enjoy the ride.From the beginning, the action is fast and furious. It doesn't let up until the last page. In this book, Buckley skewers baby boomers' entitlement mentality, pork barrel politics, religious leaders, and blogging. It sounds like an amalgam, and it is a testament that Buckley can tie all of this together and have a fun and riveting story come out.I really enjoyed this book. It's not as good as White House Mess or Florence of Arabia, but miles ahead of many so-called humorous novels."
1,Pass,"This book is not worth reading, not well written..Spend your time on another book. Had to read for a book club"
4,Delightful,"I found the scenario rather timely and particularly appreciated how well Buckley was able to provide his characters with conflicting motivations and emotions which we all face. While some of the events may never be realized, I found most of them extremely plausible and felt Buckley has a wonderful sense of humour."
4,Hilarious,Probably one of the funniest and most cynical writers around today. There's an uncomfortable aura of truth about today's situation as well
3,Some Great Moments Dragged Down by the Blunt Hammer,"Buckley is an entertaining satirist and while I enjoyed this book fairly well, I have to knock a star off due to the heavy handed and at times insultingly simplistic manner in which he deals with his BIG THEMES.In order for satire like this to really work, one must believe that things could actually occur in the real world, and that's where this fell apart. It just wasn't clever enough to pull of its conceit and was so improbable that it was impossible to suspend disbelief.And then - the story just ends - bang - it's over. The ending felt like Buckley simply tired of the story and simply quit.Thank You for Smoking was wonderful and it's clear that Buckley has a great talent - it's just not on full display here."
3,"Good book, horrible reading by Janeane Garofalo","The book itself it excellent; full of inside Washington DC humor and crisp writing. But Janeane Garofalo's voice throughout the audio book is nasal and very loud. I had to turn the treble way down in order to listen to the book, it was that bad.I recommend reading the book instead of listening to it, Janeane Garofalo's voice really got in the way."
3,Not witty enough,"I really enjoyed the film version of Thank You for Smoking, but I didn't find this book anywhere near as entertaining. There were some amusing moments, but the social commentary seemed somewhat banal and outlandish, and the characters were predictable and unlikable. I expect more from my satire.Then again, it kept me reading till the end."
4,"""Modestly Good""","A pretty good way to wake people up to the Social Security problems. Unfortunately, Janeane Garofalo is not really up to the task of reading this novel. Her weaknesses kept dropping me out of the story. I wish I had bought the book instead."
5,Politics Anyone Can Laugh At,"If you liked ""Thank U For Smoking"" you'll love this - Buckley's trademark, over the top, wit is on full display. The book tackles some major political issues with humor, and just refuses to take itself seriously. Best of all, all sides of the debate are mocked, but all the characters are also shown to have at least some redeeming qualities."
2,Great idea doesn't go anywhere,"I had hoped that this book would be as good as ""Thank You for Smoking."" It does start out promising, but the plot is very one-note and ultimately the book is pretty dull. Read ""Basket Case"" by Carl Hiaasen (or most any of his other books) instead. Far more enjoyable."
4,I Was For It Before I Was Against It,"Was a little slow and far reaching at the start but full of satirical one liners and political wit. While the humor caught me, the plot did finally thicken and I was finally captivated.Great read for those who love politics and are amazed by the transparency of spin. Buckley brings in all the players; the cold-blooded Republican business tycoon, the extorting evangelical minister, the hypocritical Roman Catholic Cardinal, the blue-blooded Junior Senator, the GenXer, the GenWhatever, and the spin masters. Brought a smirk and a furrowed brow to my face as I wondered if this wasn't too far from the truth. Looking forward to more from Buckley."
4,Watch out Baby Boomers,"This is a great comic novel that is both clever and funny. This is the first book I've read of Buckley's, but it certainly won't be the last. The political satire is cutting and very funny. Buckley doesn't spare anyone. Unlike most comic novels, Boomsday isn't a comedy of errors as much as it's a comedy of spin.Media spin, the way it controls everything the see and hear and read in the media is the central theme of the book. It is this spin that takes a red-bull fueled comment on a popular blog through the political process and debated on the Senate floor.It's a good story, very clever and worth reading."
4,Fantastic debut.,"Kate Northrop, Back Through Interruption (Kent State University Press, 2002)There's something wonderful about Kate Northrop's poetry, something missing from much of what I've been reading recently, but I couldn't put my finger on it until, while looking Northrop up in preparation for this review, I came across another review of the book that defined it: space. Northrop's pieces somehow avoid the density of the common poem without hearkening back to pre-modernist days. There's a good deal here, mind you, but it's presented in almost spare, windblown style, despite never straying far from the poetic mantra of ""image, image, image.""""When he enters the room,the walls darken,just slightly, and a cloudcovers the lake. But nobody notices. The party'salready started,and our hosts, dreamlike, serve up the lastof the summer cocktailsto gorgeous guests....""(""The Murderer"")An excellent collection, one well worth checking out. Kate Northrop is going places. ****"
2,I wish there was a better book,"If this were a less expensive book the rating would go to 3-4 stars but compared to books of similar subject matter (Porsche 917: The Winning Formula) the photographs are not very good and the paper and printing process is at best mediocre. To add insult to injury, the book is more than ""Porsche 917"".I purchased this book as reference for model building. It is some help in this respect. But the paucity of color photos and the poor resolution cause me to downrate this book."
4,Impressed!,"I have been taking PSM2 for 2 months now and I have noticed a significant DECREASE in cramping and bleeding. Although, some of the pain is still present I am quite pleased with how little pain I do feel! It is very nice to not have to dread one week because of my period! The only reason why I did not give it five stars was because I still have some bloating. But this product is certainly worth a try!"
4,Solid and fun indie album,"Santi is straight-up a fun album - and not in the shallow, good-for-only-a-couple-spins way. Much like the Arctic Monkeys, Academy is able to maintain an up-beat, poppy sound without growing monotonous or soft. Hooks are rampant, and the vocals are strong. If only they could come up with a different name...-Brandon"
5,just as good as almost here,"when i first got the almost here album, all the songs sounded the same. Then when i played it a few times and got used to the songs, i loved it. It still is one of my favorite cds. Then Santi came out. I got it and listened to it, and yet again, all the songs sounded similar. i then listened to it more often, and now i like it almost as much as their first. please dont let your first opinion judge the album! it rocks!"
3,"Another good album, but still sounds like all of the others.","I enjoy The Academy Is... in the sense that I enjoy whiney rock every now and then. The have some catchy lyrics and chords, but at the end of the day, I have a lot of trouble telling one song from the other. So, while I do enjoy TAI's music, it does have the pattern of sound repetitious, leaving me only wanting to play it every now and again. But, if you have a drive during the summer, roll down the windows and crank this. It will make for an enjoyable time."
2,close...but no cigar,"The academy is... took a shot at changing up their style, and it didn't work. There are a handful of good songs on this album, but nothing more. I would definitely recommend gettting their first album and hopefully their third one will be better."
3,"Amusing, attractive, but lacking substance","Almost Here was a grand album, including such incredible tunes as slow down, the phrase that pays, and black mamba. With the addition of the new album, Santi, to their library, I have to say that The Academy Is excels in the short, fullfilling radio-friendly beat. Santi is drowning in tunes which are infinitely appealing and fun, but there really is not much else beyond that.Sure, the lyrics are entertaining and the songs simple, but it does not take much intelligence to bop your head to the dumbed down beats which TAI offers. Undeniably, I think their a great band, and the attempt to hit the mainstream head-on is close to sure-fire success, with an album littered with simple singles, and lacking in depth.Stand-outs are neighbors, chop chop, and bulls in brooklyn, but ultimately; it bleeds into one 39:44 second session of enthralling yet reasonably generic music."
4,excellent CD,Good music from a great band. This album has some very strong songs and is another welcome addition for any James fan.
3,Good CD,"I've been a James fan for 12 years, and I love anything with Tim Booth's voice in it. I'm glad I bought this CD but it's not among their best. I'd say ""Seven"" is awesome, ""Laid"" is incomparable, ""Whiplash"" is wonderful, ""Millionaires"" is great, and this one, ""Pleased to Meet You"" is very good. Ravenous James fans will want this album but if you're going to introduce someone to James for the first time, I'd recommend ""Laid"" or ""Whiplash""."
2,Pleased to Meet You,"For their finale as the band James, this album is surprisingly weak. Although all bands should evolve with the times, James has evolved into something totally forgettable. Unlike Whiplash and Laid, this album lacks any lyrical wizardry that defines James. It seems that Tim Booth is trying too hard to make these songs sound profound. Instead they come off as just that: loosely strung together sound-scapes and forced phrases. If you are looking for background music, I'd recommend Pleased To Meet You. If you are looking for James, stop your record collection at Millionaires."
4,Another excellent Jame album,"I never would have suspected that James would top the excellent ""Millionaires"" album, but this is a valiant attempt. The only song I don't enjoy very much is ""Junkie"". ""Gaudi"" and ""Fine"" are both very very cool (make sure you get the UK import, rather than an cheaper Canadian or European copy, because otherwise you will not get ""Gaudi"" or ""What Is It Good For"", which is also a good track). ""English Beefcake"" may be the best James song ever. The last two tracks close the album strongly. Highly recommended!"
3,Double D Fun,"The Double D Avenger is a uniquely entertaining DVD starring former stars of Russ Meyers films. Kitten Natividad has always been my fav, and even though she's on the plus side of 50, Ms. Natividad still delivers the goods. This movie is for the kind of men (and women) who like good-humored fun, like the original ""Batman"" TV series. The girls are buxom and there's lots of double entendres and politically incorrect humor (like an early John Waters movie without the X-Rated stuff). The ""Crockazilla Plant"" scene is as funny as anything I've ever seen in a movie, and the character of ""Orbs, Leader of the Ta Tas"" should have her own film. Just lots of fun and a real guilty pleasure. Plus...Forrest J. Ackerman has a cameo!Joey"
1,"Sad, poor humor and nothing more","Lots of booby humor, they said Booby in every form ever imagined. But if you want even low level nudity Disney's how to fill a wild bikini puts this to shame."
5,Benny Hill Fans Rejoice !,"This B-movie is an absolute riot ! Very few flicks today can come close to the clever cheekiness of Benny Hill's comedy. This one definitely does ! The risque slapstick, saucy humour, visual gags, and innuendo are reminiscent of Benny Hill. And just like Benny Hill, this movie does not resort to offensive gratuitous nudity. Bravo to this film's creators !"
1,The Double BAD Movie,"I was looking forward to watching this dvd. After viewing the movie I couldn't believe how bad....and I do mean BAD, this movie was!! It truly was the most pathetic thing I have ever watched. I mean it would take years of practice to act that bad so I guess from that stand point they did a great job. This piece of trash is now just that, it currently holds it's rightful place, in our local land fill. My apologize to the land fill."
3,Legendary Pink Dots - 'The Whispering Wall' (Roir),"I wanted to give it a 3 1/2 star rating.Believe it or not,this is the band's 40th-something CD.They've been at it since 1980.One might even go as far as to say the LPD has become one of THE better known 'cult bands'.'The Whispering Wall' tends to showcase some of frontman Edward Ka Spel's way-out-there poetry.The tracks that sort of made me sit up and take notice were the airy psychedelic ""In Sickness&Health"",""King Of A Small World"",the somewhat industrial ""The Divide"" and the later half of ""Sunken Pleasure"".Keyboardist The Silverman and saxist Niels Van Hoornblower are still a vital part of the band.Should appeal to fans of Psychic TV,Skinny Puppy and Nurse With Wound."
4,A msut for cruising the Maine coast,This is a companion book to Don Johnson's Cruising Guide to Maine Vol I Kittery to Rockland. See my review under that title.
5,Biba Rules!,"This is the best Italian cookbook money can buy! The recipes are simple and are always delicious. I bought two copies and gave them to some newly married friends. If you are a single girl looking to land your Italian boyfriend, then I recommend buying this book and cooking him a few dinners. I'm convinced that is how I landed my sexy Italian husband...Thanks Biba!"
2,Can't rate till I hear from the seller,The book I ordered for a friend it was mailed to him had pages torn out also a colour plate . I did e mail the seller but have not heard yet
2,Biba turns out some of the best books and recipes around.,"I have lost track of the various recipes of hers I have tried...all were a success. The directions are clear, and easy to follow. The recipes are just like ""homemade"". Make one of her dishes and your back in ""momma's kitchen"". I would recommend her books to anyone who wants to learn what Italian cooking is all about. If you have been fortunate enough to see any of her cooking programs on TV - she is an absolute delight. No nonsense - gets to the heart of matter and makes you want to run into your kitchen and start whipping up whatever she happens to be making. Mangia...Mangia!!!!!"
1,Advertizing claims much overstated,"I thought that this would be handy device to let me share a printer between my iBook and my son's PC. How wrong I was. The manufacturer's claim ""works with any USB printer"" with both Windows and Macintosh is pure hype, Right off of the block, it doesn't work with any multifunction printer, something that the Buffalo tech support people will tell you from the start. And as near as I can tell, only printers that Apple supports by default work under OS X.And to add insult to injury, the Buffalo technical support people can't even tell you what printers they *do* support. But be sure and call and ask, just in case."
1,Is the worst book that I read,"The estructure of the book is very intersting, however, the edition was many, but may, error (ex. pp 73, equ. 3.53; fig, 11.18, and so on). The major problem is that the program was comming on with the book not work and the line code added in the end of the book call subrutins, in matlab, that was compiled (*.dll files).If you are a beging not bought this book.Eng. Alexis. Tinoco Msc."
4,This is tape #2.,"This is the second tape in the series of 3 tapes that are available through Amazon (or anywhere else, apparently).""Going for Gold"" focuses on Herb Perez, who is a real-life TKD Olympic Gold Medalist; ""Broken Promise"" is about a misunderstanding between two of the WMAC Masters."
1,Not too impressive,"I'm not sure why people are going crazy over this book. I purchased it after reading about it in two different magazines, thinking it would be entertaining to read. But I found myself bored after only a couple of pages. Nevertheless I read on, determined to find out what's so special about this story. Which is basically about a woman in a relationship that has grown dull. And who finds herself tempted by another man. The book plays out the different scenerios of her staying with her longterm boyfriend or pursuing the new lover.I just really couldn't get into it. I found some of the authors style choices very distracting. For one I didn't like that she gave the new lover a ""grammar deficit"". It was really annoying for me to imagine the characters getting involved when this guy sounded like an idiot because of the way he speaks.Overall the book was mildly entertaining but nothing I would recommend to anybody."
3,"It's Just ""Okay""","There are not many good options in software for children, so that this at least rates as okay is something. It is educational for sure and definitely teaches math and grouping of sets for faster counting, money values, etc. But it could be more appealing for a 5-year old boy.Other options to consider are the clue-finding, problem solving computer games of Myst (my son loves working on these with mom and dad); and the Leapster computer with K-1 cartridge. The Leapster is similar in that you must go around and complete educational tasks and earn tokens for doing the fun stuff. And the fun stuff is fun and rewarding. Yet the fun reward stuff in Math Missions is only 3 arcade style games that are not that special or interesting. Also, they are timed and go so fast that a 5-year old who isn't used to video games has a lot of difficulty. My son enjoys the math educational portion way more than the fun stuff so that the reward is not very enticing."
5,Great Software!,It's a great learning experience and really gets the kids interactive and it's amazing how much math and concepts they get in real worl dapplications just from playing this game! I would recommend this to anyone who wants their children to learn math and be ahead of their class! It gives your kids confidence to be the best at math in their class!
1,Scholastic Math Missions,This seems to be very old technology and have had extreme difficulty with the disc loading. I finally had to uninstall it from my computer and have not been able to reinstall it.
5,Las Sociedades Secretas,"Este libro es sinceramente una recapitulacion de los acontecimientos historicos que han causado que nuestra historia sea de la manera que es, sinceramente es un trabajo estupendo y es deverdad necesario que muchas otras personas se informen a travez de este libro de los origenes de nuestra sociedad moderna y como sociedades secretas han buscado de una u otra manera mantener control sobre pobnlaciones enteras a travez de los bancos y sus prestamos impagables sus mentiras y conspiraciones."
1,Essential Blues Guitar By Dave Celentano,"This would have been a Good instructional video... But ,Theres no close up on where to place your fingers .No close up of Fret placement.I just wasted my 19.95 + Tax.My advice is to buy another video, this is not the one to try to learn the Blues .Also its geared for playing an electric ,not accoustic."
2,Not very good at all,"These DVDs contain mostly personal stories and less historical accuracy of how each war broke out and why. It did not even go into why the American revolution started.The video quality is awful.The first three DVDs were pretty good, but the rest were lacking badly.The invasion of Panama is gone from this set, although that was a major victory for the USA."
3,"Interesting story, not the greatest writing style...","The plot of this book was pretty interesting, especially the last part of it. It seemed to drag on a lot, though. The first part of the story in particular dragged on a bit. Still a rather fun book to read if you've played Magic before, though."
2,Book Review,"I received the book fairly late in the estimated window provided, and it's in pretty poor condition. The binding is in very rough shape, and I can't help but wonder if it will even survive another read. It's entertaining, sure, but within a matter of another read or two, the book will start coming apart, and the description of condition mislead me to believe that it was in perfectly good condition and that implication leads me to believe that it is worth adding to my collection. I'm disappointed and may have to order another copy from a different seller to keep an ""in tact"" copy for my collection."
1,This is the WORST M:tG novel ever!!!!,"The characters and events were unoriginal and not very imaginative, the storyline was hoaky and reminded me of the old 1950's sci-fi movie plots. It might just be me, who knows... Buy Magic: the Gathering, Arena instead, for the same price it's 1000x's the book, action, and suspense!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"not good, sorry","no images in this book except for illustrated oned, no photos at all. just black/white unclear how-to pics.SAVE YOUR $$ PEEPS!"
5,texas justice,"would love to watch the video, but somehow it was sent to a wrong address,probable my screw up, please send it to the address following: 1438 sleepy hollow ln., new braunfels, tx. 78130. many thanks!!!!!!!"
1,Its a Serious Joke. Save your money.,"The person Idolizes Warren Buffet and constantly refers to him in the book. If you want a book on Warren Buffet there are betters ones else where. Use a search engine on ""Cult of personality"". The examples are pityful and hard to follow. I am really glad I didnt buy the book and I borrowed it from the library."
5,Wow!,"Saw her live and was blown away; heard the CD and more of the same! An amazing performer, an amazing voice, amazing songs...what can I say? Sheryl, Ani, Alanis--move over for this girl!! And you heard it here first..."
4,Very interesting...,"An interesting story that kept me going. Without giving too much of it away: A WWII era sub is transported to the future, only to find themselves in the company of other ""warriors"" from humanity's past and future. They've all been recruited to aid some of the inhabitants of the current earth in an ongoing internal struggle. Nice plot twists and lots of characters."
5,Great Phone,This is a top class phone. Im going to list the top 10 reasons why u guys should buy:1. Its the smallest pocket pc.2. It runs on Windows ( mine has never crashed and its fast)3. Great music playback.4. Great Movie playback.5. good to check emails on.6. nice resolution on the screen.7. long battery life.8. good support by clubimate.com9. sleek design10. Its CHEAP!!Update the phone and u are Good 2 GO!
4,More than my expectections,"It's nice and useful more than I could imagine when I bought it. The wireless function is very powerful when you are able to catch the line (in your home or in the hotel or .... free wifi ...). A lot of software are available to personalize your PDA / smart phone!The shipment was very good and the transaction through credit card was perfect! Thanks a lot, it was really a good deal!"
4,"Good product, wonderful service from imate","Pros:1. the product works very good, convenient and easy to connect to my outlook calendar to keep everything in order.2. imate service is very convenient, you can chat with experts online, it also provided free software, wonderful.3. battery is longlasting, do not need additional one.Cons:1) few bluetooth earphone can connect to this cellphone2) sometimes the alarm rings 1 or 2 hours ahead, ruin your sweet dream.3) if you set password, and if a call comes in when the phone is locked, there is chances that your phone will not respond to any other function rather than dial. you have to reset the phone. don't worry, doing so will not damage your setting, just reboot the system.overall, good product though there is some flaws. I like Windows Mobile."
1,WIDNOW MOBILE PHONE,"I DON'T RECOMMEND TO BUY WINDOWS MOBILE PHONE. WHEN I GOT THIS PHONE, THE CAMERA IS BAD. I LIKE LG CU500 BETTER THAN WINDOWS MOBILE PHONE."
3,Good Pocket PC but impractical Mobile phone,I purchased imate Jam basically to use as mobile phone but lack of keypad and impedance of using stylus plus its bulk and weight make it a lousy mobile phone. I did not like the soft key pad. It is not as practical as the real thing
5,Very funny,i found this book very funny my friend memorized a few phrases to use on the teachers he doesnt like and best of all even if they look it up they wont know what he meant... (its complicated... kind of)
2,"fun, for a bit","This is a very short book that provides translations of non-exactly standard Latin-English phrases, grouped by general theme. There is neither a coherent narrative, nor anything about ancient Roman culture (even presented in a comic fashion), which means the book provides little other than (very) light entertainment. The various sections cover topics like ""Romulus and Remus jokes,"" ""T-shirt Slogans,"" ""Trash Talk in the Colosseum,"" ""Road Rage,"" and the like. Still, one can find some gems, like: ""Illuci ivi, Illud feci"" (been there, done that), ""Malim predari"" (I'd rather be pillaging), ""Go ahead punk, make my day"" (Age, calamite - fac mihi hunc diem felicissimum), and ""Quagis?"" (Wassup?). You get the gist, there ain't much more..."
1,X-treme Latin is X-tremely Lame,"Did these other reviewers read the same book? It consists of very tired uhmm ... ""jokes,"" which you have to know Latin for in order to get the ""hilarious"" translations. Translating something lame into Latin does not make it funny! The only tidbit I found amusing was on p.15, the Latin for 'If you can read this, I lost my trailer,' which would be pretty funny to have in South Carolina. As for the rest of this yawnfest, the only Latin you need to know is 'caveat emptor'."
4,"A Nice Cat Book - a review of ""Ginger Finds a Home""","Both my children like this story. [They are boy and girl; just turned 4 and 6.]The artwork is simple and attractive and the story is gentle and clever. As a mom I particularly like that Ginger doesn't just bound after the little girl and that it takes patience and persistence to coax him home. And once home, the little girl needs to be understanding of how Ginger feels.He lookedin all thecorners andunder allthe furniture.But poorGingerwasso nervous...that when the little girltried to shut the door,he ran out into the garden as fast as he could.Four Stars. [B+]. Good read-aloud. Good story that has something to discuss."
5,The begiining...,I had read my class the original Ginger book and then I found this prequel. We loved it! Wish the author would write another.
2,cd,I guess I just do not enjoy this type of music as I thought that I would. The music is good for those who like it but I did not find it spiritually uplifting as I thought that it would be.
1,Horrible,"The Bratz dolls are no where near as good as the Barbie My scene dolls. These dolls don't even have feet! There heads are blown way out of proportion and their makeup doesn't even MATCH what outfits they come with! Their whole body shape is messed up. These dolls are for babies. If you are a teenager, adult, or pre-teen, you should buy a barbie my scene doll. They are much better, stylish dolls than these awful dolls called bratz."
5,ONE OF THE BEST DOLLS EVER!,"Like I have said in previous reviews, Meygan is my favorite brat! This doll, the newest Meygan, is totally up to date fashion wise. The brat dolls are educational because they teach kids the styles of today and each one has a different personality. It is for the older crowd, not the 3 year olds that want to be a ballerina, just like barbie, when they grow up. The clothes look really good on this doll and she provides alot of fun!"
4,More than one prisoner,"the story of a man who has spent 25 years in prison is illuminated by the hardships of the others in his life. Gordon Loomis' brother, Dennis, is imprisoned by the affair he is having with a local beauty, which endangers his wife and kids; his neighbor, Jada, a 13-old-girl with a crack addicted mother, is imprisoned by the danger of her life; and his only friend, Delores, is imprisoned by her own weak nature, which has deprived her of happiness all her life. Loomis' problem of resuming his life after incarceration is accentuated by the problems the others face, which makes his story a rich portrait of a contemporary community plagued by crime, drug abuse and the hopelessness they all share. at first, this novel was hard to read, because the characters seemed insignificant. but they and their problems grow on you and it becomes highly impactful."
2,"Excellent writing, depressing story.","Morris has a way of writing that enables the reader to get deep into a character's psyche, and this book was no exception. Each character in this book is in some way intensely desperate, and very real. Morris' writing style is incredible, her descriptions sharp, and her pacing satisfying.That said, this is one of the most depressing books I've ever read. Nothing good happens until page 266, and it was a tough, tough read up to that point. I had to push myself to finish it. While Morris' writing is phenomenal, this just isn't the way I want to spend my free time."
3,an enjoyable read,"I loved Songs in Ordinary Time, A Dangerous Woman, Vanished, and Fiona Range; this one was OK...an enjoyable read, but I found one of the main characters irritating enough to diminish the overall pleasure of the book."
5,Excellent,"This is a must-have for classical guitarists. There are advanced, standard-repertoire pieces suitable for performance as well as approachable pieces for study - all spanning from the Medieval to the Romantic era. Best of all, the editing and fingerings make the music approachable every level of ability. It does not get better than this."
3,Entertaining but sparse...,"I was hoping for more; but what I was given was a romantic account of Napoleon's conquest and a 'cheer for the underdog' telling of Champollion's obsession with the ancient languages. Would I recommend the book? For the budding Egyptologist I would - but if it's answers you're after, try Cheik Anta Diop's Civilization or Barbarism or, and I'm sure they're out there and I'm sure I'll be reading them, a multitude of more descriptive and scientific works about the decipherment of the heiroglyphs. In fact, a glossary at the back of this book cites a large number of advanced readings - maybe I should give it a second look."
2,Keys of Egypt,"What a shame this is disappointing. For anyone wanting a good, well-written modern biography of Champollion, with lots of background on hieroglyphs, they should go for The Keys of Egypt by Lesley & Roy Adkins."
2,All over the place,"I bought this book at a museum bookshop in San Francisco. I was mainly interested in the story of Champollion deciphering the Rosetta Stone. The author jumps all over the place chronologically and topically and doesn't get to the main story of the deciphering of hieroglyphics until the very end. The book is discursive to the point of absurdity. And this guy has taught writing at Columbia University!!! Mon Dieu, what a bad example this book is."
3,champollion,I found the style of plot the author pursued as confusing and laborious. He was all over the place for waht is a fascinating subject. I would not be inclined to purchase any more of his work.
3,Fascinating story but a difficult read,"I picked this book up because the subject intrigued me. I was hoping to read an account of how the Rosetta stone was discovered and ultimately deciphered. Instead, the author focuses the narrative on the two main protagonists, Napoleon and Champollion. The book is written in the present tense, with allusions to the future, and is primarily a poetic analysis of the two characters. It seems the author's primary focus is not to tell the story of the Rosetta stone, as much as to understand humanity through these figures. About these two men Meyerson writes,""They are eternal types who have always existed and who always will."" As Daniel Meyerson teaches writing at Columbia, NYU, and Bennington College, it makes sense that his book would be more literary than historical accounting. This is unfortunate for people like me who would like to read an objective histoy on the subject, but would interest people who enjoy literature and language."
5,The ultimate field guide for LA!,This book was required for the field Botany course i took as a Wildlife Management student at the University of Southwestern Louisiana. This book remains my favorite for field identification of many common plants in the southeast. It is easy to use. The photos and descriptions provide enough information to accomplish the task of identifying specimens to common and scientific names.
2,this was not my kind of movie,other than being a english movie I did not find it that great of substanceif you r not interested in political movies do not buy itas usuall I had not seen itanother one of my mistakes of the dayMust only buy movies I have seenchfancier
1,Dull and Mindless,"If you think the world would be a better place if Joseph Stalin was still around you might like this film, otherwise you should skip seeing it. The characters are cardboard cliches. The plot is silly. To extend the running time to three hours the film is filled with meaningless cuts of military jet landing that have nothing to do with the story. ""A Very British Coup"" has none of the wit, intelligence and charm of ""House of Cards""."
4,The British are so good at drama...,"I really enjoyed this movie. Yes, it is the story of a left-leaning politician. Yes some of the accents are a bit hard to understand (captions, please). But if you loved the House of Cards, with the incredible Ian Richardson, playing the role of a conservative right wing Prime Minister (after Margaret Thatcher no doubt), you will love a Very British Coup which speaks to the political turmoil doing the 1970's era Britan that was the impetus for the rise of Thathcherism. Social unrest, union strikes, global gamenship are all on display in this movie. The British do this type of drama so well. This is top form BBC drama..."
5,The Best of the Best Political Thrillers EVER ON TV!,"This is the very best of the best of political thrillers on television. I saw it back when it first was on PBS years and years ago. I am thrilled it is now available on DVD. I always hoped it would show again on PBS and was disappointed that it did not win the viewers' favorite they had on television last year. Perhaps that was because they only voted on Masterpiece Theatre? But I thought this was on Masterpiece Theatre. Then again, it could have shown on Mystery. Anyway, it is fantastic and those who don't enjoy it show that they are hopelessly right-wing and therefore contemptible."
1,Self-indulgent lefty excrement,"This is propaganda without a shade of subtlety or nuance; I understand leftist Brits go in for this sort of thing. Story's Harry Perkins is a paragon throughout, and don't you know good intentions beat back all troubles. His enemies do not possess a shred of decency of course, just like in the real world where everyone who opposes unions is a big poopy head. For people who prefer cartoons to reality only."
4,An engrossing political story,I like to read of political shenanigans and this book showed just how the establishment can silence an idealistic bunch who happen to rise to power.
5,From Go to Woo.,"I read this book while my husband was studying honours year computer science. It was,in one word, readable. I could understand it, and it gave me a good grasp of the field and a better appreciation of what specialists in computer science actually do with this stuff. I am not a computer scientist, but like to be active in understanding what my husband is up to, and I could take this book in. So, while it is probably not for the complete novice, I found it educational for an arts grad who has obtained all of her information on computing osmotically.Great read, when will it be in print again. I lent my copy and it never came back home."
1,Rich Parents?,"""Mommy! Daddy! I WANT to make a hip-hop album!""That line was probably followed by: ""why of course, honey, but let's talk about it after your riding lesson, ok?""I can't say this album is a complete waste. It did, after all, provide at least 15 minutes of laughter. Who on god's earth would spend 20 bucks on some idiot rich kid mumble his way through rhymes like ""we went to the pool/it was pretty cool""? Nobody! So listen to the free smaples and get a nice fat chuckle out of it. But keep Jammin', Adman! You Barmitzvah is not too far off-- maybe mom and dad will buy you a better producer."
4,Great acting but VERY low-budget,"Was not expecting a lesbain story when I first saw this but I really did like it. Shot on Video somewhere in The Bronx i was shocked at how at first i was very distracted by the ""video look"" and the really low-budget style of shooting, but I really got hooked afetr a bit and thought it was very cool."
1,Garbage 4 Life,I have watched this numerous times & it's ridiculously STOOPID! The camera work is a joke & could have been recorded on a cell phone at the time for better quality. Also the cameos by Carrot Top & former UFC light Heavyweight Champion Rashad Evans adds to the goofiness of the movie. I can't believe the director was allowed to do sequels after this. The only good thing on the movie is the speech by Tony Tomahawk which turns out being in the deleted scenes. In the scene Tony teaches Toro about the streets in a weird but sense making analogy about lions & sebras....
2,Paul Neal,Very dissapointing .Where are all the complete film clips of there singles.I think the promo for this is very misleading
2,A mediocre documentary with little music,Those expecting full song videos and interviews with Slade band members will be disappointed. There are brief concert and television clips interspersed with short interview clips with music critics and other band members commenting on Slade songs and offering some insight into their musical style. It does get across the band's impact on rock music of the 70's and big Slade fans will want this DVD. The DTS and 5.1 soundtrack is ultimately a waste since music is at a minimum on this DVD.
3,Could Have Done So Much More,"Whilst I enjoyed the insight into Slade, I am left a little dissapointed, that the producers could have done more with this product. No song is played in its entirity, and we listen to half a dozen so called critics disect the Slade singles. No sound clips of TAK ME BAK 'OME, CUM ON FEEL THE NOIZE and 'EVERYDAY' The critics seem to omit the issue of Slade deviating from their foot stomping patch by making a critically acclaimed film (Flame). Also very little from the Band themselves as far as interviews go. But still at least some recognition for the many hours of joy they brought me in my youth. For the fans only, for those wanting to know more about Slade... you had to be there."
3,definitely recommend,"if you're into trance/techno, you should definitely add this to your collection."
1,Terrible experience,"If you want this for recording, do yourself a favor and buy an acoustic electric guitar, or use a shure sm57 instead... !!!terrible for recording!!!....Nothing else to add"
5,Wonderfully Annotated Edition of an Arab Classic,"Though this book is somewhat expensive, it is definitely worth the money for those interested in understanding the political philosophy of al-Farabi. His book is truly beautiful in its philosophical grace. As a Christian whose tradition also was profoundly impacted by its contact with classical philosophy, I could not help being pulled in with great fascination peering into how Greek philsophy was adapted and understood by a philsopher of Arab-Islamic culture.This edition is excellent. Included with the translation is the parallel Arabic text with variants and an extensive introduction and notes written by the translator, Richard Walzer. Walzer's work here is excellent making a reading of the contents of this book a study in itself."
4,Fundamental Islamic Philosophy,"For a reader of Western philosophy, this tome comes as a wonderful and exhilarating shock. al-Farabi is at heart, a NeoPlatonist with regard to politics, an Aristotelian with regard to logic, and a Spinozan with regard to metaphysics. His command of the tradition is apparent from this immensely brilliant and comprehensive work of political theory. Beginning with an account of the First Cause, and the beginnings of becoming, al-Farabi lucidly sketches the existence of all the immaterial and material bodies of the universe, until we reach the art of politics and governing. This is a wonderful work of philosophy, even if certain sections (in particular the section on the organs of the body) are a bit tedious and outdated. A supreme part of the Islamic canon."
4,A good read on the dynamics of early speed,"Charles Carroll knows his subject and knows how to communicate. Written in 1991, the book contains excellent insights and is a good read. It is unfortunate that neither the body of the book nor the appendix contains adequate information concerning the results of his study of the initial segment of Quarter Horse races; especially the 50 yard times that are referenced but not quantififed."
2,Just OK,"I always enjoy reading handicapping books and try to take at least one idea from each that I can use in my handicapping methodology. This just didn't give me that. I don't play quarter horses, so maybe that's where this is useful, but basically this is just another way to calculate speed figures, but the process is more simplistic than even the published figures. Bottom line- I enjoyed the read, but I don't think there is anything I can use to improve my handicapping."
4,Honegger:Symphonies 1-5; Pacific 321; Rugby,"I bought this set especially because I like the 5th symphony and was interested in Dutoit's interpretation. I don't agree with the reviewer who held that the 3rd. sympnony was his best. I played in a performance of that piece, and most of the musicians in the orchestra disliked it. Also, some wit had penciled into the parts a letter ""d"" before the ""g"" in ""Liturgique"". The 2nd symphony is for strings and the score could well have been discarded into the waste basket. In order to appreciate Paicific 231, one must see the movie that was made for the score."
4,New SVA ref book puts the formal analysis vs dynamic simulation debate to rest,"When I saw this book, my first thought was, ""Don't we have enough books on SVA already?"" However, having worked with Ben and Srini in the past, I was curious to learn more. As I browsed through the book, it became evident that this is a masterpiece. This is the first book to take a design verification engineer's and manager's perspective in the assertions arena. It puts the debate on static formal analysis versus dynamic simulation-based assertion checks to rest by providing guidelines on how and where to use these technologies appropriately. The book also includes a lexicon of commonly used temporal requirements/properties in plain English. This is valuable reference material for engineers working in the trenches."
3,Cheap but not good,"Not real Spanish stuff. Look rather primitive and dark, lack of elegancy of real Spanish plates. Do not recomend."
4,Lisa Lee,"This toy rocks!!! I've had it for almost a week and I am almost a pro already!!! As long as you know the two tricks to doing it you can do anything! (They are in the directions!)The only thing is don't go to crazy because I did. It hit my finger and cut it!!! It didn't bleed though!!! I would definitely say though GET THE SATURN ONE!!!!! It looks so cool when your in the dark!!!!! It is a really, really, really fun toy!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Poor Quality New Product,"I had to return the item because my dog pushed open the door too easily. Advertising the product as new was misleading because it was a poor quality new product. Given the vendor's return policy, I have just wasted my money and am not likely to shop with this vendor again. The vendor should consider putting a better description of its product with the advertisement."
1,dog crate,Inexpensive for this size crate but I got what I paid for. The quality is not there. The metal is thin. It is hard to close the door. Spend the extra money and go for a better quality crate unless you plan on using it for a very short time.
5,An incredible text,"I had the pleasure of taking several classes taught by Dr. Clinton at Southern Illinois University. His knowledge of the classics and how they relate to modern government is simply incredible. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest. It is defintely written for a scholarly audience, however. Don't pick it up if big words and lots of footnotes intimidate you."
2,Nothing too special.,"When I first heard that Nelly would be collaborating with 'N Sync, I wasn't so sure what the result of that would sound like. It's an okay hip-hop song. The original version of ""Girlfriend"" was rather boring, but with Nelly lending his rap talents to the remix, it's somewhat better. But after the radio stations played this song to death, it's dull and annoying."
4,The Remix is better than the original.,"Its a pretty good cd single. It features 4 songs plus a enhanced video of ""Girlfriend"". I dont really care for Nelly, but this remix featuring him is pretty good. I never really cared for the song ""Girlfriend"" until this remix single was released.I still haven't seen the video for ""Girlfriend"" yet. For some reason my computer cant access it. So thats the only down side for me. The remix of ""Gone"" is cool. I didn't really care for the spanish version of ""Gone"" though. But its a worty cd single to add to your Nsync collection even if you already own their album ""Celebrity""."
3,NSYNC Mixes It Up With Nelly,"When NSYNC decided to collaborate this past Winter with Nelly, it was no surprise to the true fans of Pop and R&B. Nelly's style teeters on the brink of mainstream while NSYNC's style borders on the brink of non-mainstream pop. Bringing these two acts together was a work of genius for Jive.Musically, Nelly brings a rap style to this Neptunes, mixed track that reminds me greatly of Lisa ""left eye"" Lopes's appearance on Space Cowboy. The beat compliments Nelly's rapping style and when Justin jumps in with his voice, it's almost as though he and Nelly could have been doing the song by themselves.The Spanish version of Gone feels weird to me. It's teaching me a lot of new Spanish words though ;).All in all, I would give this cd 3/5 stars. I would love to see more collaborations with NSYNC and Nelly in the future."
5,The must have book ...,There are lots of books out there on the subject of World War 1 aircraft ... But here is the one you must have if you want and need to know the various color schemes for planes and special markings used by the pilots. This book brings these airplanes alive for the reader and as a research tool ...
3,"Ok game, but poorly written software","As a Scooby-Doo enthusiast, my son cannot find too much at fault with this game. It's actually pretty fun. However, I was annoyed with the fact than when I installed it on my computer running Windows XP using the administrator account, you could not use it on any other account (my 6 year old obviously does not have an adminstrator account). Most well written pieces of software do not need to be run as a system administrator and have access to the system registry, but it is not the case with this one. It took forever to figure this out, because it lets you play part of the game without this, but when you send Scooby to the pagoda to get scooby snacks, it just takes you back to the main menu.That said, I can see some value in this game. It works your memory (e.g. the pagoda exercise), it works your math skills (such as when you make recipes for Shaggy and Scooby), and it works your deductive reasoning skills (such as working to solve the mystery)."
3,OK,"The game was great for us adults and was a hit at our dinner parties, but our 19 and 16 yr old children found it too scary and had very bad nightmares at night."
2,Not too good.,"I received this gift for Christmas, and was very dissapointed. The Scary Stone Dragon has a great plot, but I solved it in 30 mins. I have two other ones that I've played for days, and I still can't solve them! Do not, I repeat do not, get this game."
1,Does not remove scratches...,"Although aware of other negative reviews, I went ahead and ordered this product. It DOES NOT remove scratches, so do not bother."
4,"Great, but don't expect miracles","At first use, I noticed just a slight improvement to my cell phone. But, using it two more times, I noticed more and more of an improvement. yet, some small, tiny scratches were still noticeable. Worked great, but do not expect miracles."
1,Made screen worse!,"While I figured this was too good to be true, it was inexpensive and the previous reviews seemed to be split down the middle, so I thought I'd try it. Not only did it not buff out the fine scratches on my MP3 player, it left a ring on the screen, as if moisture got just under the screen. Really wish there was a product that could help my screen (which accidentally got put in my purse next to a nail file). Only gave one star because the system won't let me give zero stars."
2,Not for matted screens!,I don't do reviews but feel it's important for people out there looking to repair their LCD monitors/TV's. This does in fact buff out the area treat so you're left with a semi gloss hot spot on the matted screen! Seems like this should be listed in the product description as to avoid ruining a screen as has been done in my case. I can't say if it buffed out the scratch as the one I have is pretty deep but didn't want to GLOSS that patch anymore than has already been done. If you have some small scratches on a gloss screen I believe this product will work well for you but buyer beware otherwise!
2,Didn't work for me.,"I usually don't like to say anything bad, but honestly this didn't work for my scratches on my cell phone. I got the scratches from a nail file in my purse. Maybe they were too deep? Who knows?"
2,I Was Hoping for More,I bought this product to fix the scratches on my cell phone. I was skeptical but proceeded to purchase it. The product arrived in a timely manner. I applied the product as instructed & the scratches remained. I applied another coat the next day & still nothing happened.
3,Important sidenote,"Although it may take a few buffs, it can get the job done, and get rid of some of your scratches. It's a tad small though. About the size of an average adult pinky finger.With all the new phones coming out, i feel like i should point out that scratch removers should NOT be used on touch screens. If you buff out too much, it will mess with it's sensitivity. It COULD be used, but it's a bit risky.Another note: People say it doesn't work, but it does(eventually). It's not going to get out a scratch within a matter or seconds. You might as well try using sandpaper for a result like that. It's slightly abrasive, to keep from damaging any more. So use a bit, and keep scrubbing."
1,"False advertisement, not suitable for iPad","The listing for this products states that it is for use on the iPad. However the description says do not use on screens with a coating. As stated in the user manual, the iPad and iPad 2 have an oil resistant (oliophobic) coating on the display, which will become less effective over time. Also, iPad is not listed under the subtle ""attention"" section of the user manual. Also, some iPhones have a similar coating. this product whould likely ruin your oil resistant coating. This will result in excessive smudging and streaking while using your ipad and your device will always be more difficult to clean.If your iPad is under warranty, use of this product may affect your warranty agreement as the iPad user guide specifically warns against such products. Some customers have had scratched screens repaired under warranty.Amazon should not allow this misleading product listing, which describes the product as a ""scratch remover for iPad"""
1,Confused and Disappointed,"So I bought this based on the positive reviews, but after using it as directed (both versions of the directions -- on the package it says rub vigorously, but on the tube it says rub gently), I got no positive results whatsoever. I spent about an hour trying to get small scratches out of my cell phone screen and a glossy LCD display, but the product did nothing for either. Now the LCD has a barely visible discoloration around the scratch, but otherwise the product did absolutely nothing for either item. Even though most of the other reviews seem positive, I'd say you should at least research a few other options before going with this one."
1,This stuff sucks!!!!!!!!!!!,"my camera has some scratches on it. I didnt expect this stuff to take out big scratches, but it didnt even take out the small scratches. This stuff actually made mt screen worse. Im seeing scratches on it that i have never seen before. If you are reading this review, remember, to never,never,ever get this crap in a tube."
1,Not worth it totally waste of money does not work,I will not recomend these item to no one please don't lie it does not work at all i waste my money.Very disapointed!
1,This product does NOT work!,"I was skeptical about buying this based on the reviews, but the price was appealing and some of the success stories had my hopes up. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 with the smallest scratch on it that I wanted to fix. I followed the directions the sender sent me which stated I needed to apply pressure while polishing my screen. This ended up giving me a white pressure ring around my tiny scratch. Then I saw there were directions on the bottle that said, ""gently polish"" so I feel lied to. This product is not worth the $7 and doesn't do any good."
1,Not good for LCDs,The Displex Display Scratch Remove does not work for LCD TVs. After using the whole bottle not even a single cm looked better than before. Do not buy if you are trying to fix a scratch on a LCD.
1,"Not worth your money, vasaline works better,","I have tried this and it did nothing but leave a smear across the screen, I tried it three times with the same out come, I wouldnt recommend it"
1,Complete Crap,This did nothing but make the scratch look twice as bad. I tried it several times and each time the scratch grew wider.
2,Did not work,"I bought this to remove some scratches form a laptop display, but this product actually made them worse.I'm still giving it two stars because I may have used it on the wrong kind of material."
1,Didn't work at all!,"I bought this product because I had dropped my PSP between the couch cushions and when we put the recliner up it had a scratch on the screen, It wasn't horribly deep, but bad enough to bother me. From what I could tell this would have solved my problems, but it didn't. It came out a runny liquid, I followed the instructions but the scratch was still there, so I tried it once by letting it sit overnight and still nothing. I have tried this product a total of around 8 times on the same area, it was the worst investment I ever tried. But what was I expecting from a cheap 6 dollar product?"
1,Useless,"Tried it on a cellphone screen, and I'm pretty sure it added more scratches than it removed. At least i received it fast"
1,didn't help and made new scratches,"I used a clean cotton cloth (none were included as stated in the description). I think it has created new scratches! And the deep scratch I was trying to buff out, no luck..I followed directions. Disappointed and upset. My screen protectors are coming today, going to put those on, and prevent any new scratches..is all I can do now."
1,Don't bother!,Total hype. This product does not work as claimed. Even after many applications and time spent with my 60gig video iPod the scratches remain. Beware that the product costs seven dollars and they charge another seven to ship it!
1,didnt work for my camera screen,"OK, yes i know this is more of a scratch remover for cellphones, (or so it says) but i decided to give it a try in my sony h20 camera screen (since i read good reviews of people using in their cameras, ipods, and psp) my screen had a medium size sracth on it, but to my big disappointment it let a big yellowish stain all around the sratch! it ended up looking horrible! it looked worst than it was.I dont know if this works on cellphone screens but it certainly didnt work on my camera screen."
1,worse than worthless,I tried to use this stuff to polish the scratches off of my palm pre. Now they're all quite a bit more visable. They look like little rainbows.
1,Didn't work for me.,I used this on the display to my digital camera that had gotten scratched with keys. I have a very small canon pocket camera that I bring with me when I bike. I followed the instructions and this did absolutely nothing to the scratch. I know it may be that the display is different from a cell phone or a hand held game. So all LCD displays are not alike .
2,Did no harm,"I was unsure about the product from the wide disparity in reviews, but since there appears to be no alternative, I tried it on an LG Decoy phone. The good news was that, despite warnings from others, there was no negative consequences--no pitting, rainbow sheen or other problems created by the product.It did take out some minor scratches but all the noticable scratches are still there. They are definately smoothed out to the touch, but readily visible."
