2,I agree with reader from NJ,"If this had been my first Anne Rivers Siddon's novel, I would have never have read any others. I found it terribly boring and the characters not up to par. I would definitely recommend you read Outer Banks, Colony, or Fault Lines, Up Land and The House NExt Door"
1,using this product for a migraine,"If you are buying this product to relieve migraine pain please save your money.The cranial cap is ineffective and non-refundable. It does not mold to the head and it only stays cold for ten minutes. I would reccomend buying a rectangular ice-pack, hard or soft, from CVS or other such retailer. Take the rectangular icepack and drape it over the top of your head. Then fasten it in place with a long sleeve t-shirt wrapped turban style around your head."
3,ok but not great...,I like the lamp ok but its not that great. Trust me it looks better on the amazon site than up close I have this and am very disappointed with it. The liight bulb didnt come with it and the wires on the back included to help mount it are waay too short I had to go buy wire just to be able to install it replacing an existing light fixture. So save your money and go to home depot.
2,foot rest,"It's noisy and the movement of stepping on it isn't very smooth. There isn't a stop when the foot rest is pressed towards the downwards position, so it hits the floor which is loud enough on the hardwood floors, it even startles me and I'm the one pressing it. I wouldn't recommend this product as it needs improvements. Not worth the money."
1,Piece of garbage.,"As you can tell by the description we are very dissapointed! The picture and description of toy made me purchase this item for my son who loves trains. However, once opening the product my son wasn't interested in the toy. The pieces do not stay together, and as he tried to push his new ""choo choo"" across the table it fell apart. Even the plastic that the toy is made out of is cheap and flimsy. Such a waste of money!"
5,Wonderful book!!!,"If you like reading about fictional families like Nora Robert's - O'Hurley's, the Fortune's Child series, then you'll love this series. A must read."
1,"booooooooooooooring, or how to make you hate good songs","ok, this is a remix album... but why not a little more variety in it? as always happens with all this projects, some remixes are good, some are mediocre, some are bad... but here I started to hate the songs 'cos the remixed songs are always the same: 'How do I know?', 'You know where to put it' are repeated till boredom. this cd is really really boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooring, and it doesn't deserve a better review."
1,MY EARS ARE BLEEDING!,I swear to god if I ever meet this band I am going to kill them! They ruined Evanescence's songs! I felt like puking after I listened to it! I didn't buy this off of amazon but my mom bought it for me at best buy thinking I would enjoy it. I wanna burn this! If you love Evanescence as much as I do then you will take my advice and NOT BUY THIS CD! Trust me you are saving yourself from bleeding to death from the ears.
1,Ouch...,"Just gave this one a spin.Never again. If I could put a cd in the recycle bin of my pc I would.The vocalist tries... she's got some talent, but not many can match the original. There are moments where this sounds like a karaoke session with a drum track and really bad keyboard sounds.The track ""Haunted"" is played so squarely... it's like it's made for my grandparents.Please believe the bad reviews. I'm not sure anything else needs to be said. If you want Evanescence, listen to the real deal.(Empty Trash)"
1,...,"I'm not into Evanescence AT ALL and I heard this cd by coincidence. I only thought Imaginary (Origin) was okay. And as if Evanescence didn't cover My Tourniquet badly enough(yeah it's by SOUL EMBRACED actually), this horrid band must make it even WORSE.Compared to this, Evanescence is God -and me saying that, says a lot...I kinda dislike Evanescence-..Suddenly I feel so much more respect for Evanescence, that they arent as horrid as this band..."
3,Shes no Amy Lee but woah...,"Title says it all, this ISN'T a bad tribute at all, i'm not very fond of the vocals, but the instrumentals sound almost if not that, exactly PRECISE as to how they were on the Fallen album. Get this not for the mediocre vocals, but for the EXECELLENT note for note instrumentals on this cd."
2,Evanescence a Tribute Album,"I think it should be flattering to Evanescence that people are covering their songs, but Amy Lee puts so much conviction in to her songs you can almost feel the pain she has gone threw. In those songs the people are too happy and I don't feel convinced. Music is about feeling, they wern't singing with feeling at all. Later Days."
1,wtf?XD,"I'd buy this CD for a laugh. Nothing more. If you want Evanescence music, buy Fallen. If you want a joke, buy this."
4,Very good cover album :),"This CD is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be; folks, get over the fact that the singer is someone other than Amy Lee!Static Heaven definitely has some talent here. The songs My Last Breath, Everybody's Fool, and even Bring Me To Life were done better by Static Heaven, in my opinion. However, the songs Whisper, My Immortal, and Taking Over Me sound better by Evanescence. Also, the bonus Electro remix of BringMeToLife is nothing to get excited over...All in all, it's a quality cd (and usually cheaper than Fallen)."
1,A bad copy...not a tribute,"When I first saw this CD the question that came to my mind was why a band with only one official album have a tribute CD already. Then when I listened to the CD the question switched to why did the band permit them to do this tribute.This CD isn't a tribute, it's a copy. Every one of the songs on the ""Fallen"" CD is copied, including the bonus song ""Farther Away"" that's a bonus track on some import versions of ""Fallen"". Plus they added a terrible dance remix of ""Bring Me To Life"".I would be fine with that if the remakes were good, but they aren't. The songs on the CD range from bad to REALLY bad. The lead singer tries really hard to match the vocals of Evanescences real lead singer but most of the time she fails. Some of the songs sound like a bad Las Vegas lounge band trying to cover an Evanescence song.They call it a tribute, I call it an insult. Do yourself a favor and just buy ""Fallen""."
2,An average tribute,Not great. The singer's voice is weak and whiny compared to Amy Lee's powerful vocals. But I have to give it two stars for the music. The music is great.
1,Sorry i even bought this,"Okay, I was really excited when I bought this at a local music store but I literally had to turn it off it was so bad. If you really want a good tribute CD, get the string quartet tribute to evanescence."
3,I liked it...,"I thought this CD was good. It took talent for them to do this. No, it wasn't Amy Lee... Not even close... But it was a nice gesture and ya can't blame them for trying. :)"
1,I'm so glad Evanescence doesn't sound like this!,"She tried. I'm sure she tried, and I'll give her that much, but the girl singing here just doens't compare to the richness and the range of original writer and vocalist, Amy Lee. I profusely recommend that you buy ""Fallen,"" the original debut album from Evanescence, rather than this pop-sounding so called tribute."
1,YUCK!!!,"OMG, this is disgusting. I feel violated...i mean sure i admire them trying to sing them, that they like them that much...but it sounds totally...brittney spears or something like that. Pop i guess. Like some other people said on here, if ur gonna do this, do it better. I would definetely recommend the original over this."
5,Super tool for trimming flowers,"I've owned one of these ""thinning shears"" for over ten years.Absolutely the best tool I've ever seen for quickly trimming stoutrose stems or other woody or tough flower stems. Makes preparingflower arrangements a snap. The edges are as sharp as they wereon the 1st day - a marvelous product!"
5,My kids LOVE these,"This is the only vitamin my daughter will take without crying. I don't think these are the best tasting children's vitamin out there, but they are better than the chewables I took as a child. My daughter does not like gmmi bears or jelly beans, so even though those taste better she won't have a thing to do with them. She does like a gum and gum has always been forbidden in our house (until now). It is so much nicer to have my daughter remind me about taking her vitamin.If gum will get my daughter to take a vitamin everyday then gum it will be! Why should taking medicine be a chore?"
1,Let's teach our kids that medicine is candy!,"Do you want your kids to believe vitamins are candy? That they can and should be scoffed down like sweets? While Vitaballs don't contain elements like iron, which can be fatal in relatively low doses, a lot of ordinary multivitamins do. Kids should be taught to be cautious with vitamins and other medications, and packaging them as candy does NOT send that message.If kids are taught at an early age that vitamins are safe to consume like candy, they are likely to develop similar attitudes to other medicines and drugs later in life. So, if you want your children to think drugs are fun, that taking medicine should be a recreational activity, by all means, buy Vitaballs. If you want healthy children, feed them properly. Honestly, garbage like this is the last recourse of the lazy parent."
4,Solid If Slightly Rough,"I saw this band live in Charlottesville, VA last night, and while their line-up has changed slightly from this release, I am not disappointed I bought this album. The musicians are exceedingly talented if not totally polished, and it's a pleasure to listen to them. But who really wants this type of music (progressive bluegrass, maybe?) to sound manufactured? A large part of the attraction is in the humanity and truth, and this recording has it. The version of ""I've Just Seen a Face"" is marvelous, and so appropriate to the arrangement I'm almost suprised Lennon & McCartney didn't think of it. Support an independent band's tremendous and sadly largely unknown talent by getting this album and enjoying it. Then find them playing live somewhere and go."
1,Buy some that are made out of metal...,"The first time I used these push-up bars the flimsy plastic they're made out of cracked in three different places. Perhaps they will still hold up and not fail entirely, but I'm not going to risk an injury finding out. In the trash they go... I suggest you buy some that are made out of metal tubing."
3,Decent pushup bars,I weigh well over 200 and these aren't as sturdy as some I have had in the past. But they do a decent job.
5,Great,Very smooth turning. Great for organization. It does add some height to the items on it though. I had to move the shelf above.
5,Life saver,"I bought the OXO Good Grips 16-inch turntable to go into my long corner cupboard where it gets hard to access items. The turntable has made it so I don't feel like I have to crawl into the cupboard to reach anything! Plus, it can hold a lot of weight. I have many canned items stacked onto the turntable, yet it still turns freely and without effort."
4,"High-quality, but doesn't fit where intended","This is a high-quality product; very stable and neat-looking. However, a word to the wise - if you are buying this to make an awkward corner cabinet less awkward, make sure you measure for clearance in the opening, not just whether there is space on the shelf inside to fit this. Because the base is so wide, it wouldn't fit in through the opening (and wouldn't you know, the awkward corner one is the ONLY upper cabinet that doesn't have the shelves mounted on the adjustable plastic peg things). I had already opened the plastic, so I put it under my kitchen sink to hold some cleaning products, which is more convenient and looks very nice but not necessarily something I would have spent the money on."
5,Good quality turntables...............,"Was very pleased with the quality and ease of turning the table, even with heavier items. Bought four - 16 inch turntables for my kitchen corner cabinets. The rubber base insures against any slippage in the cabinet itself.....very sturdy. Would certainly recommend."
5,Great for organizing my fridge condiments,"I have more condiments then I can fit in the fridge doors! I needed a good way to steal keep them easy to access and not cluttery - this is the perfect solution! Before I had them in a fridge Binz container, but then you have to go through it to find everything and the front ones block the back ones. This makes it perfect and I even keep my milk and cream cartons on it too. Turns VERY smoothly and is well built. Very pleased - love OXO they rarely disappoint!"
5,I just got this and I LOVE IT!!,"I want to get a couple more!! I put it in my pantry, put so much stuff on it, all that I can reach and immediately thought - I want another one!! And of course, why did I wait so long!! This holds all the veggie and olive oils I have, vinegars, cookies sauces, etc. I just love it!! Oh and it's really sturdy. It's so big at first I didn't think it would fit, but it's absolutely perfect!"
5,Good quality,"This is a nice big lazy susan which I use in my pantry. The slight edge prevents things from slipping off when you turn it. It turns smoothly and quietly, and the rubber feet hold it firmly in place. Well worth it."
5,The turntable is perfect!,"This turntable is just perfect for my corner cabinet. I have several heavier type bottles on it, such as olive oil, and it turns easily."
3,I have no clue -,I have not clue this is not for me....I am not sure yo guys why you need 19 word in this review to require review....
5,Nambi,I love it!! Very sturdy; spins easily. I hated my side-by-side fridge until I put one of these turntables inside. Now frequently-used items are easily reachable. The other is under my bathroom vanity and holds my many bottles / cans of hair care products. I am ordering more for my vanity and pantry. My only wish is that they were available in 10-1/2 inch size. Definitely would highly recommend and am very pleased with them.
5,Practical,"This is a great product. Hold all of the seasonings, the oil & vinegar as well as the paper napkin dispenser all neatly and it rotates so no one has far to reach for things."
3,"Fun for the kid, not so fun for the adult","My 5 year old son really likes making ""bugs"". It is a nice father/son activity.However, the replacement goo is unreasonably expensive and the on/off function doesn't work 1/2 of the time.Often times we fill the molds up with goo but can not get the oven to start. After 10 or more minutes I can usually force the cooker to work but by that time the little guy isn't too happy.Removing a hot mold plate from the oven is also a bit on the unsafe side. This should not be done by a child - I have a hard time getting the plate out without burning myself.That said, it is one of his favorites."
4,Fun for kids,Yes you have to purchase the 60w skinny light bulb (its just a chandelier bulb) which is no problem to find in the store...I found mine at the grocery store.The has given my 6 year old boy lots of entertainment. He loves making bugs...even big sis got into it too.I would've given it 5 stars if the bulb was included...
3,Incomplete Memoir,"This is supposed to Clarke's memoir of his life after he moved to Sri Lanka, but other than a few recollections of his early days on the island, it mostly consists of essays and columns he wrote about space travel. I would have preferred a more insightful memoir of a westerner living in an Asian country instead of just Clarke's takes on the planets and conjectures about the future of space travel. The most interesting parts come early in the book, where Clarke writes about meeting a variety other ""colorful"" western residents, including the legendary Major R. Raven-Hart, the author of the wonderful ""Canoe Errant"" series of travel books. More anecdotes like that would have brought more life and color to this otherwises lackluster memoir."
1,Omron Pressure Cuff - Center Aisle LLC,"I retrurned the cuff on March 9, 2011 because it wasn't large enough. I requested a refund and as of this date I have not been refunded."
1,"book is alright, seller sucks","I ended up only browsing through this book and ended up needing to return it and the seller was absolutely horrible about returns.I think in the end I spent $15 returning it to them, and I never saw a cent of my money from the return."
1,Buyer Beware,"True - this has been ""evaulated"" by the EPA. You can NOT use them in a real estate transactions. You can't even sell these in some states. So beware, you are not getting a $4000 Radon Measurement device for $120. You are getting a device that I think is probably good for a homeowner. Eleven dollar charcoal canisters are approved for real estate transactions."
4,Good book.,"It's a good book. It allows you to feel as if you are a part of the picture instead of having a bunch of information told to you. It was easy to learn by being able to relate. I wish the pictures had more color. I don't think you're ever too old to like pictures in an academic book. But overall, I love the format of the book."
3,"Not bad, but misuse of titles distracting...","This book wasn't too bad, although I think Ms. Fairchild has several much better works. I also lamented the misuse of Philip's titles. I found these constant mistakes both irritating and distracting. I would like to say that it was also very irritating to hear him called the Earl of Rockford, MARQUIS of Chalmondelay on one page, then the MARQUESS of Chalmondelay, Earl of Rockford on the next page. They aren't at all the same thing!!! Then he was Philip Chalmondelay (as his family name), when it should have been his title! Argh.All in all, it wasn't a bad book, just occasionally a bit sickening sweet. The characters were likable, and it ended decently."
5,don't take your own ignorance out on the product,"i don't yet have children, but shpping on this site i saw this adorable set and went to read the reviews for it. how unfair can you be to write a negative review on a product because you thought you'd receive it with the crib pictured? if you are someone who relies on reviews to evaluate the safety and quality of things, i'm sure you're disappointed to see that someone rated it a one because it didn't come with the crib! i think this seems like a beautiful set. for those with little sense, i can tell you, it does not come with the crib pictured. i would actually not want to see a picture of the bedding not on a cirb, so thanks babies r us for showing it that way."
1,not enough information in description,"I bought this item thinking that it came with the crib... the description does not mention what it cincludes and the photos do not say nothing either, i returned it and lost money in the shipping."
2,Plastic shovel!!! Not all metal.,"I looked for small construction vehicles from Siku as I had seen some at a friend's that was all metal. The most vulnerable part - the backhoe shovel on the excavator - is made of plastic and seems very breakable. It is moveable and I can imagine that my son will use it often until it breaks in a couple weeks, then it will lose its attraction. Also made of hard plastic - the undercarriage, the back portion of the flat bed and the tires on both vehicles. Might as well by matchbox or something else local, as this did not hold up to the reputation of an all die-cast metal toy I thought it was."
2,Too small for little hands,"This is a very cute toy, but is not very user-friendly for little hands (that don't yet have much dexterity). This toy is really quite small; be sure to check out the size before deciding if it's what you're looking for."
5,Good book for the 'realistic' bride,"I recently became interested in books that depicted the engagement and wedding planning process in a realistic light. Perhaps because I did not fall into the fairytale dream wedding scheme, but then again, how many of us do?This book provided an eye opening read that catered to my emotions are a bride to be...and not just a bride, but a woman who just happened to be getting married and experiencing a big change in her life and status as an individual.I found myself in the stories in the book...I found myself laughing at the irony of those stories and how I was feeling and I also found myself mourning along with the stories of the loss of the single self and readjusting as a married woman.I knew I was experiencing the things that are talked about in the book, but I didn't really understand why. Now I have a much clearer picture. I highly recommend this book to any bride to be!"
5,"Whew, so I am normal!","This is a great book for every bride-to-be! While I am thrilled and cannot wait to marry the love of my life in front of family and friends, it is nonetheless a very emotional and scary time. This book made me laugh, made me cry, and most importantly, made me realize that all of my feelings and emotions are completely normal."
3,Interesting,"This book wasn't what I thought it was going to be-- I thought it might tell me about how to deal with nosy people, how to take time for myself, things like that, but it dealt a lot more with the emotional preparation involved in the stage of engagement, and all the emotional work you need to go through before getting married.This book is geared toward women who don't cohabitate with their soon-to-be spouses, though, so buyer beware. I've been living with my fiance for two years and a lot of the ""letting your single self go"" work has been done, so if you're like me, maybe there's a better book out there! I still recommend it, but just know that you'll be ignoring a good deal of that section!"
1,More about me than help in sales,This was a more about me book than a help in sales. Most you could not apply to how and why people buy something. Not worth the money.
4,Very Pleased!!,Love S. McDowell workout videos and once I saw this online I decided to purchase it as it was a very good price. Received within time listed. DVD was in good condition and no delays in starting even though product was/is used. Thank you.
1,Do not purchase,"This is absolutely the worst exercise video I have ever used. Her instructions are minimal at best and usually the camera was focusing on the ocean rather then the move. There is no real warmup and no cooldown at all. She uses some Muay Thai in her technique but she called a knee strike a ""face smash"" ????? I am glad that I didn't pay retail and I wished that the seller would have let me return it. Luckily, I only paid $1.00 + shipping (3.50)"
2,Terrible Instruction!,The workout routine is okay but the instructions are terrible. The instructor just transitions without giving you time to adjust or figure out what direction to go. There are blackouts during the routine which are very annoying. I'm just happy I only paid 6.99 for the dvd and it came in a box with the aerobics dvd. I suggest sticking with the Tae-Bo collection even though it costs a little bit more than this series.
4,Really Good,This DVD contains for 20 minute (approx) workouts - two that incorporate kickboxing on the aerobic step and two regular kickboxing. The ladies are energetic and fun without being annoying. The workouts - especially the step/kickboxing - will work up a good sweat.
2,Poor production,"This video has poor production value, they change camera angles too often and seem to cut away in the middle of the workout. It is a good long workout but difficult to follow at times do to the poor production."
4,Great Vintage Book,"Great overview of Vintage... one of the first books I've read on Vintage, although I've been a collector for a long time. This book is easy to read and has photos for reference... I would have liked some extra shopping references and online references to sites like:..."
5,"""...narrating the history of Spanish language in an approachable style and using simple language...""","""How was our language born? How did it expand? How has it diversified? Alatorre answers these and other questions by narrating the history of Spanish language in an approachable style and using simple language. This book provides us with elements that allow us to understand the language's origins and to follow its development. And as the author says, to share in the magic of its history."" Such is how this treasure of the Spanish language is chronicled and included in ""The New Essential Guide to Spanish Reading"" which is published by America Reads Spanish: a campaign aimed to increase the use and reading of the Spanish language through the thousands of libraries, schools and book stores in the US."
4,Great book for teachers just beginning learning centers!,The book provides great ideas about how to get a learning center set up in a classroom. Excellent information provided to copy.
3,If You Want To Construct Learning Centers In Upper Early Childhood Classrooms,"Opitz gives us an unusally rare look into making centers of learning in Grade 1-Grade 4 classrooms.Some do not always work for all kids, but implementing these in your room will break the monotony of traditional groups and discussion. The book organizes itself as a How-To manual by taking you through a series of steps to creating the learning areas."
2,police is not obeying enough rules,"original and inventive, as always. the stories worked better than usually by the author. some with real interesting concepts. but he never knows how to stick only to the story, to obey sensible literal rules, how to form the stories in a sensible way."
1,Painfully dissonant,"An album entitled ""For Relaxation"" should be relaxing to listen to. It shouldn't have such incredibly dissonant chords that it induces a headache! This music would be more appropriate for the soundtrack of a cheesy evil sci-fi movie.There are some beautiful nature and animal sounds under the music. It's just impossible to enjoy them through the awful notes."
5,Finding the reason for human existence.,"A pomegranate of a book where each seed of truth plants itself within your heart as living awareness: person to person, moment to moment. Again and again I have read, reread, absorbed, mulled, contemplated and meditated upon the fruits contained within the covers of this book. Buxbaum reveals and explains insights ""found at the beginning of the Torah and at its very heart."" An Open Heart: The Mystic Path of Loving People holds significant teachings for every human being. This is a very important book to have and to share with others."
3,psychological,"in its balanced approach which makes sense in the system of mind magic and hermetics, however i have a decent background in this formal feild of study i imagine anyone else might be lost without it, slightly outdated we will say but at the time must have been eyeopening, helps one prepare to do a future study in ceremonial magick if they are ready of sound mind to partake as a beginner."
1,midlle pillar,"The original printing is far superior,enabling you to use the system without complication,and bringing instant results.Although the authors are very competent,the distractions are far too great to allow a straight forward delve into,and acomplishment, of the original.Where can i obtain the original,please,anyone?"
4,An outstanding work,"If your into the application of of esoteric knowledge into your daily life this book is for you. If the study of Psychology is your intrest, this book is for you. You will only better yourself and deepen your knowledge of kabbalah. If your anything like me as soon as you pick this one up you'll just about have to see it through without any breaks. yes its that good. A definite favorite of mine."
2,No es una obra de arte.......,"Es un libro de los narcómanos. Lleno con muchisimas frases de la lexica inormativa. Si a ti te gustan tales momentos y acontecimentos, entonces este libro para ti!"
5,GREAT BOOK!,"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK, BRINGS BACK ALOT OF MEMORIES. THE STORY IS VERY POIGNANT AND GIVES INSIGHT OF LIFE IN JAMAICA AT THAT TIME.ALSO VERY INSPIRATIONAL,YOU FEEL GOD JUST RESDING IT."
2,Superskin wheel cover,"Make sure you measure your wheel's diameter before ordering. This wheel cover is made in 3 sizes and Amazon does not make that clear when ordering. It is shipped in the smallest ""A"" size and my wheel needed the next size larger ""B"" - minimum 1'5/8 diameter. So I sent it back asking for next size up and got nothing for feedback."
3,Cheaper then the last one I bought,"This works, but it's cheaper leather then the last one I bought for a different car. The leather is thinner in places and didn't stretch evenly so some places the seam is tight and others it's a bit wide. Several times the eyelets tore through trying to get it even as well (didn't happen with the other one).Sewing it up took about an hour, and you REALLY want to have a thimble on your finger to help push the needle through so many times."
1,Don't bother,"Don'T botherTHE WHEEL COVER IS OF VERY very poor quality ,stiff, dry, thin leatherand extremily dificult instilation.iT WILL TAKE YOU HOURS OF AGRAVATING STICHING."
1,Roxio Easy Media Creator 7.5,"I was suckered into upgrading my current 7.0 creator. There's no difference. I thought I could start to copy DVD's I couldn't before, but I was wrong. I also thought that the newer version would be more user friendly than the previous version, but again I was wrong. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Just Say No,"Positive - lots of tools.Negative - lots and lots and lots of menus and screens.Even the most simple task like editing home video is now three times more complicated involving different programmes within the toolbox and different pop-up windows. Whatever the opposite of intuitive is, this is it.Too many features look like half-baked bodge-ons from Roxio rather than a thought-out whole. And don't expect any help at all from Roxio. For a laugh, you should visit their product forum, where members of the public try to help each other to get Roxio's stuff to work, having completely given up on support from the software house. I have to admire the company's candour and bravery for hosting the forum, because it is one long list of complaints!Frustrating to use, I wasted my money upgrading from VideoWave 5 to this, don't make the same mistake. Should have bought (and now will buy) Power Director instead."
1,Roxio Easy Media Creator 7.5,"This is by far the worst computer software I have bought lately. I wanted to use the program mainly for data transfer. The drag-to-disc feature won't recognize that there is a disc (yes I know what kind of CD to use)in my cd drive. It was so bad that I uninstalled it! Bad program. Oh yeah, I have a new P4 computer running XP Pro. There's your review...you gonna print it?D Parker"
1,What a botched job they did,"I have used Roxio Easy Media Creator 6, and with the new computer I got Easy Media Creator 7.5. Bad mistake. It seemed to install okay, but when I clicked the ""Registration"" button under tools, I got a ""Page not found"" fault. What?!! Then I entered the support nightmare. Roxio's support via various Web pages, automated ""answers,"" etc., is UNBELIEVABLY bad--poorly designed, leads in circles, etc. I finally was able to submit a question, though when you click ""Submit"" you get no acknowledgement, so I apparently submitted 5 or 6 copies. When the system they have did respond with answers to my 7.5 problems, the answers were all about version 6. I wanted to stick with Roxio because I have lots of playlists and labels already created, but I'm going to uninstall and dump it. Don't use this product."
1,UgottaBkidding,"If you are considering purchasing this with CD burning as your primary concern, Save Your Money! 7.5 is a cataclysmic disappointment. An actual downgrade from Version 6. I should have left well enough alone."
2,Doesn't work with widescreen,"Once I figured this software out, I was able to do a slideshow of my pictures, integrate video, and produce a decent DVD. Only problem is, it distorts all my video footage by forcing it into 4:3 whereas my DVD camcorder shoots in 16:9. This sucks. I have been buying other software packages ever since trying to get my video to stay in 16:9. Roxio support did e-mail me back with the blanket statement that it doesn't support 16:9 at this time. Even in the new 7.5 version. Roxio needs to join the rest of us in 2005 and bring their software to be compatible in widescreen."
3,Outdated,"This product has been superceded by Easy Media Creator 8 Suite. Roxio is now owned by Sonic (makers of 'MyDVD').7.5 was an incremental upgrade. 8 is a new product with a new interface and numerous new features. It is a huge product suite that makes lots of system changes- install it carefully.Always make sure you have your registry backed-up before installing software like this (I recommend Iolo 'System Mechanic' 5 or 6 for registry maintenance and back-up- as well as other maintenance you should be doing regulary).Even better, buy a disk imaging program (I recommend Acronis 'True Image 9') to make digit for digit copies of your drives before making any major changes to software and hardware configurations."
1,EMC 7.5 still has bugs,Do not buy this product. I've been attempting to contact tech support regarding DVD Builder for the last week without success. DVD Builder is one of the applications in EMC 7.5 and it is totally useless. There are postings that go back to 2003. One would think Roxio would have fix the bugs by now.
2,Order was not complete .,Order was not complete but the seller cheerfully and immediately refunded my money. Would recommend this seller to anyone.
1,Terrible software,"I loaded this software to my computer. When I tried to run it, I receiveda message ""Missing Certificate File- reinstall"" I attemptedto re-installand received same message. I attempted to remove program from computerand received message "" missing certificate file"" Every time I rebootmy computer, I receive a series of messages about missing Cetificate File.I have to cancel each one.I went to Roxio web tech support and they wanteed $49.95 to takecontrol of my computer and fix problem.I googled issue and found this was a common problem.This looks like a planned consumer rip off"
2,There are other better CD/DVD software,"I tried both Roxio and Nero. Nero is what's left on my machine now. Roxio is crap. It's unstable and took me hours to clear up the mess after I uninstalled it. Roxio used to be the king but it went down the hill since verion 5. If you are to buy a CD/DVD software, look elsewhere instead."
1,I wish I could rate this lower than one star,"I upgraded from 7.0 to 7.5 on a Media Center PC. Simply put, this software is a piece of crap, and I've spent countless hours trying to eliminate it from my machine since. I can no longer burn DVDs, and can no longer record under Media Center. Whenever I try to run Video Wave, it crashes before I can even call up the settings -- that is, it loads and then crashes immediately.The Roxio support site is a joke. Don't even try.Don't waste your time or money. Go with something like Nero if you prefer, just stay away from this garbage."
2,has no support for dual-layer discs!,"i've been using roxio products for many many years. for me, they've installed and been VERY useful. but appears roxio's latest version isn't really up to date at all - they appear to be selling a version without dual-layer disc support. i'd wait until they release a version that does.this version is essentially obsolete."
4,One of the better consumer Video Editing/DVD Authoring solutions,"I am suprised to see so many people trash this suite so quickly. I never use it for burning CDs/DVDs/Audio player (Nero, Winamp anyone?), but a combination of Roxio Capture, Videowave Professional and DVD Builder is really good for camcorder DV->DVD video editing and conversion. Features include support for still images, videos of differing resolutions/specs, video effects, overlays, text overlays, etc. you name it. Pinnacle Studio 9 is still a notch better in terms of features (the only feature that this suite doesn't seem to have - manipulation of audio volume of video tracks in the timeline), but its wickedly unstable and gets my Oscar for the most crash friendly program. Call it my uncanny luck, but Studio used to corrupt my projects just after I spend hours editing the video and done with it making me start all over again. I was looking for a stable alternative and this suite has saved my day."
2,unsure,"was hoping it would help aid in mole removal. seems to have flattened it some, but its not quite going away yet"
1,item sent not the same as one displayed,"Beware if you want to buy this product. The image displayed shows a cable with two male 6-pin ends. The packaging on the product clearly states '6-pin to 6-pin', which is not the case, but rather '4-pin to 4 pin'. This is certainly the fault of the company, Offspring Technologies, and Amazon is somewhat complicit as the image they display of male 6-pin ends of this product online is NOT the same as the 4-pin ends that one can clearly see, through the plastic packaging.Now I have to decide if its worth the time and hassle to return this foul-up."
2,Not what i expected,I expected the book to offer more assistance to those that have been a CASA for awhile. This was more for those new to the role.
3,Better ways to spend my dime,"I can think of better movies to pass the time with. I understand and accept that it is a corny film, and there were some good moments. But I wouldn't watch it a second time"
2,"Excludes a large part of the Caribbean, the Bahama Islands","A book on this subject is a welcome addition to the library of any herpetologist. However, this book has a number of shortcomings including its exclusion of the entire Bahama archipelago. A book with this title should include these islands with their endangered species. The book includes 8 color plates each with up to 11 color photos of native species. Unfortunately, a number of the captions do not match the photos on the plates making them useless to the uninitiated.This book will be useful, however the typos and missing geographic coverage along with the unusually high price for such a small book are definite drawback.This is a college-level, acedemic textbook and not a field guide which may account for its price."
1,FOX/Groening Continue To Frustrate DVD Fans,"First of all, they could have fit more episodes on this disk. Second, why the random choice of episodes? Why not put ALL the Halloween episodes on, or at least keep it sequential?These guys seem almost purposely spiteful in the way they ham-hand their DVD releases... can they get it right once? Is that so much to ask?Apparently."
2,Just Buy Each Season,"We bought this DVD under the premise that it included episodes 5, 6, 7 and 12. Key word being included, not only. Never assume is a lesson well learned. We were then highly disappointed by the fact that these were the only episodes on it. In my opinion these aren't even the better episodes. Unless you just want these four you had better just settle on buying the season releases or taping the slew of them they play on Fox the week of Halloween."
1,Save your money!,"Thanks for nothing, FOX! Why can't you release seasons 4, 5, 6???This isn't even a well-thought out idea not being all the treehouse of horrors to date and all. It seems to me FOX is just looking to make a little extra $$$."
4,A great selection....short and sweet review,"I am a simpsons fan, and I bought this DVD. I LOVE the TOH episodes, and personally I think 5-8 were the best for a compilation. Plus, the featurette with the aliens was nice too!"
1,What a rip-off!,"Your money would be better spent buying Season 1, Season 2, Season 3, etc. of the Simpsons rather than shell out hard-earned cash for this junk. If they are going to release a ""Treehouse Of Horror"" DVD, what not have ALL the episodes on there??? What a freakin joke! Do the masterminds behind this two-bit excuse to make more money take us for idiots? Don't buy this DVD! Buy the season series instead and get ALL of the ""Treehouse Of Horror"" episodes!!! Makes sense to me...."
3,Save Your Money!,"Of the 13 ""Treehouse Of Horror"" episodes (With the 14th on the way), Fox give us four (5, 6, 7 and 12), with no commentaries and no bonuses (Other than the Kang & Kodos featurette), all for a steep price.My idea is to save your money for the box sets! Unless you want to kill time with that until the Season 4 box set come out!"
4,"Halloween, Simpsons-style","The ""Treehouse of Horror"" Halloween episodes of the Simpsons have consistently been some of the funniest of the series. It's great to finally see some of them collected on one DVD. For the Simpsons completists who already own the first three seasons on DVD and plan on buying the rest, you don't have to worry about getting redundant material because this DVD collects the later ""Treehouse of Horror"" episodes that probably won't be in season anthologies until years from now. So, if you were holding out for that reason, I recommend you stop holding out and get this DVD now."
2,A great idea gone horribly wrong!,"The Simpson's Treehouse of Horror is the best of the Simpsons, but I for one am insulted with this DVD. The Halloween episodes, which there are over a dozen at present, should be released either as a complete set or in sequence (1-4, 5-8, etc). The cost for this set may be minimal, but the cost per episode is still higher then those of the complete seasons. I'll wait for them to do it right. They may be greedy, but they aren't stupid."
3,misleading,it was an alright dvd...but if you look at the dvd case it shows mister burns as dracula....a very funny episode...but the episode is not on the dvd
2,Treehouse of horror.,"The best episode is not on this dvd. They should of put ""Treehouse of horror II"". That halloween episode is way better than these! WHY FOX?! Why couldn't you put my favorite episode on a simpsons halloween dvd?? That halloween special is when homer, lisa, and bart have nightmares because they ate too much candy! Their dreams are so funny...and in homers dream, a robot falls on mr. burns. When homer wakes, up he finds out that Mr. burns head is stiched onto his! The only reason I kind of do not like this dvd is because they did not put in that hillarious episode..but i still like some of the episodes on treehouse of horror.Ps. In the episode i was telling you about, those 2 drooling aliens come to earth, and when homer lets Ned Flanders use his magic monkey paw that only granted him bad things, Ned wished that those aliens were gone...homer was mad because NED made a wish without a bad thing happening to him."
3,Moderately Amusing,"As a Simpsons fan, I was intent on buying this DVD, which bears a number of Treehouse of Horrors. I am NOT buying the Seasons on DVd, because I'm only collecting those of my favorite show, M*A*S*H, however, to remain on topic-this DVD had a number of my favorite halloween episodes and was glad to have. One things I'd like to point out,- as a network, Fox must edit to fit in commercials, and the DVD extra, which only an observant one will notice, is that each episode is unedited. There are a number of scenes I've not seen before on TV, and yet, saw on this DVD. So, that's a good little extra feature, but other than that, all we have are the four specials."
4,I know it's just to milk us for all we're worth....,"...but the Simpsons is the Simpsons and it's still great tv. I give it 4 stars cos I know it is to milk us fans...but that doesn't change the fact that it's high quality tv. I love the Sismpson. Viva the Simpsons. May they never die. :)But also, may they continue to put out the boxsets and do it faster. Twice a year would be nice and affordable for most fans."
3,"I smell a rat... I mean, a pigeon-rat!","You can't beat the price and considering the SLOW release schedule of the complete seasons, you could be forgiven for grabbing this disc to tide you...HOWEVER would it have been too much to include Treehouse #3 and #4 (two of the best of the series)?Also...be advised that while the DVD case pictures Mr. Burns as Dracula, that episode (from Treehouse #4) IS NOT included with this disc. What's the big idea?"
3,TOH is not an accurate representation of The Simpsons,"In response to a below review by a person who has never seen The Simpsons, but yet bases their entire take on the series on this one DVD, that's not fair at all. Treehouse of Horror does not follow the storyline of the show - they are little one act parodies of horror movies that come around Halloween each year. Parents with small children should be smart enough not to show their kids something with ""Horror"" in the title. It is not fair to judge an entire series on a DVD of selected alternate-universe storylines. The humor on the Simpsons in the good years was far from crude - see Mr. Plow or Marge vs. the Monorail.As for this DVD set, it's just a random sampling thrown together to make money for the holidays. Save your money and buy a boxed set."
2,Just 4 episodes?,"Wow, I love the Simpsons, but this DVD is a ripoff. If they were going to go through the trouble of releasing a Treehouse of Horrors collection, they should have included all the Treehouse of Horror's to date, instead of just 4 of them. Last I counted, there have been 13!! They shouldn't be wasting their time with cheesy 4 episode sets. Instead, they should focus on releasing the seasons a little quicker. By the time they get around to Season 8, there will likely be newer, better medium than DVD. Save your money and wait for Season 4."
4,Who Needs MY Opinion,"... the amazon.com review above nails it perfectly-- there's little I could possibly add.That said, I'll give this 4-1/2 stars because: (a) I reserve the full 5 stars only for the absolute best, and Brahem has definitely produced a couple of these during his career; and (b) this recording retreads the ground of this group's earlier outing, ""Pas De Chat Noir"" somewhat. Then again, if a vein isn't exhausted, why cease mining?In short, this is great music-- lovely, atmospheric, exquisite, and of a seemingly effortless fluidity."
4,really a travel in the dream land,"I ordered both Le voyage de Sahar and Le pas du chat noir recently. When I received them, a performance of Anouar Brahem was announced in Cairo, Egypt, where I am living. Although I enjoyed the concert, I have been a little bit disappointed by the live performance, since A. Brahem was not performing with the two musicians accompanying him on Le voyage de Sahar and Le pas du chat noir. I feel that this trio (lute + accordion +piano) is a wonderful one, and definitely Le Pas du chat noir is the best album. I enjoyed Le voyage de Sahar too though."
3,just a remark,"Though i find it interesting and nice music it surprises me that the song 'e la nave va' is to my personal opinion simply stolen from philip Glass (Glassworks) a classical 'minimal music' icon from a few decades ago, it is the same rhytmical structure and chord progression, strange people get away with this"
3,Good If You Don't Have Fresh Lavender,"I am used to being able to pick lavender fresh so this lavender does not seem very fresh. It is a good insect deterrent to keep in cupboards, drawers and closets. I put it in little cloth bags. I needed some right away, but will definitely try to grow my own next time."
2,I Returned this Book to Amazon...,"I returned this book to Amazon after reviewing it for a couple of days. I was put off by the dry writing style. I borrowed Scott Kelby's ""Photoshop CS2 Book for Digital Photographers"" from the library and much prefer his easy to read style.Mr Evening's writing style just wasn't for me."
4,Excellent coverage 4.95 Stars,"This is the first version of this book that I have read. I have found it to be an excellent read for anyone wanting to get the most out of CS2. Pretty much every aspect of CS2 is covered, from the layout of the program windows to calibrating your monitor to photo retouching.The only reason I am not giving it a 5 is because of the way the author dismisses working in the LAB color space. Ever since reading ther Dan Marguilis ""Photoshop LAB Color the Canyon Conundrum"", LAB has become a major part of my workflow. Martin Evening has either not read Dan's book or disagrees with it. Too bad because I think that Martin's insights would be valuable.Never the less I highly recommend this book. I would also like to mention that even though the book uses only Mac screenshots and keyboard references, as a Windows XP user I did not find it to be a hindrance. The folks at Adobe have done an excellent job at keeping the interface on the 2 platforms identical."
4,ADOBE PHOTSHOP CS2 A PROFESSIONAL IMAGE EDITORS GUIDE BY MARTIN EVENING,EXCELLANT BOOK. COVERS CS2 WELL. UNDERSTANDABLE. STILL READING AND LEARNING.
5,Pro's choice,This is the only book you'll need to get started.Used it as a text book for digital imaging classes and still refer to itoften. I have a whole shelf full of books by some of the best in the business and this one is the most well worn of all.
1,Avoid This Book,"I hate to write a negative review. I really hate to. I am a serious photographer, though, and a Photoshop user with intermediate skills. I bought this book having seen write-ups in places like ""Luminous Landscape"", expecting that it would help raise my game and teach a lot of new techniques in PS. What a disappointment. Yes the book is luxuriously produced and has color throughout. The problem is the content and organization. Evening never explains any concept well. He hints at the potential of each technique that he covers, then gives a single example of how to use it, and rarely more. Even the workflows mentioned in the examples is confusing and incomplete. Dodging and burning turns into a confusing discussion of how he revived an old archival photo. Sharpening becomes an advertisement for other software. There's really nothing ever systematic or complete here. Surely there must be better guides to Photoshop. This one left me wishing for a refund."
3,I'm rewinding it...,"If you don't know Goldrush yet, do not start with this one. It starts off great (track one is one of their best), but you can tell the rest was a collection of B-sides and extra tracks not suitable for the full-length. Get the debut album, if you like it (I did, ALOT) then get this to hold you over till the next one.Recommended if you like - DOVES, EMBRACE, TRAVIS, ATHLETE"
4,Great Little Films,"The review stating that The Brave has a glitch in its smooth play on a DVD player was submitted well before I purchased this set myself. I took a chance, and for that I was rewarded with a perfectly functional two-disc set. Both films play perfectly on the DVD player. Perhaps it was simply a bad print on the previous reviewer's disc.Both films are excellent, the acting shines, and if you are a fan of either Johnny Depp or of the Indie film genre (or both) then this set is definitely for you. Do not expect great action sequences or explosions, this is not Pirates. This is film brought down to its most basic layers: good script and superb acting."
1,Don't Support DVD Pirates,US DVD market is flooded with Korean and Taiwanese bootlegs. Both countries never signed international copyright agreement and these discs are being distributed by organizations that wildly participate not only in movie piracy but also drugs and prostitution. Use google or yahoo search engine (keyword: Korean bootleg dvd or similar) and learn the truth for yourself. Please don't support criminals!!!!
2,The Brave,"Gack. Still, Johnny Depp with long hair does have a certain appeal. That was pretty much the only good thing about this movie."
3,This product is Manjar not Dulce the leche,"Good taste, but is not as good as the Rio Platense Dulce de leche. It would be great if we could find in Amazon Dulce de leche from Uruguay: Conaprole, Los Nietitos..."
4,A sweet return to those early years,"How did this one get missed? This movie popped up on DVD with no promotion, no fanfare, and yet it is one of the most heartwarming flicks I've seen in years! Rob Reiner returns to an age he knows well and depicts every tender, awkward, and funny moment you remember when you were 14. Yes, it may not be as complex in tone as Stand By Me, but the emotion is dead on, and every shot feels warm and familiar. It's a nice return to movies of the 80s like The Breakfast Club and Big that win you over with story rather than special effects. Everyone can relate to this movie!"
3,:|,"This movie was okay. I watched it with my friend after reading the book and felt afterwards that I had just wasted three dollars and an hour and a half. While this movie wasn't bad, it wasn't all that good either. If you have some extra money and time to waste, rent this movie."
4,Very cute and fun family movie!,"I thought this movie was very captivating and fun to watch! It deals with more of heavy topics such as a failing marriage and mental handicaps, but I still think it's safe for kids eight and up."
3,Warm and Enjoyable but Lacking Character Development,"This is a good movie, warm and entertaining, but with less duplication of story line, and deeper character development, it could have been great. The back and forth accounts of each of the two main characters' versions of their interactions is initially interesting but its novelty wears off. Too much time is spent on the two main characters when there were so many interesting characters in this film and they deserved deeper development."
3,Love the movie but the disk I received was defective!,"This is one of my favorite movies, wonderful story about young love. So I was very disappointed when my dvd finally arrived and it froze in the middle of the movie! I bought it from THE WOODLAND GROUP, LLC (vsource)!"
5,My favorite movie ever,i love love love this movie. i love it so much that I got the book that the movie is based on and read it over and over.
3,cute story,"predictable, but cute. The characters are well acted and the script is quite interesting. the only reason I gave it a 3 instead of 4 stars is that the 1st 45mins are very slow. Worth watching."
2,Why such lazy writing and film making?,"This was poorly written and woodenly acted. Isn't a family film worth doing right? Then why the boring repetition from his and her point of view? Why so much filler? We DO know the difference between well crafted family films like (Natty Gann, Little Woman The Sandlot, etc.) and films like this one."
5,Pretty good,"After seeing the front cover of this film and reading the synopsis I had an expectation that was perfectly realized, a rarity. In any case, my wife and I both agreed it was a very good movie. Not something we'd necessarily watch again (we watch almost nothing twice, though), but far and away better than the 53% rating it was given on Rotten Tomatoes. It's true that not much happens but we both found ourselves interested throughout the movie and surprisingly would have even enjoyed another 30 minutes or so added on the end."
5,Family movie,"This movie is about that first love. Love between Julie (Madeline Carroll' character) and Bryce (Callan McAuliffe's character) when they were second graders. One of my all time favorite movies was 'Stand By Me'. This movie is along those lines. Takes you back in time to your childhood memories.There are no special effects, no surprises in this movie. It is a great family movie for all ages. The only thing that bothered me a little was flipping back and forth between Julie's and Bryce's version of the story. This kind of flipping back and forth can get a little repetitious.We liked it, we hope you like it too!"
2,Brown Sugar,"I purchased it to get a specific recipe - banana pudding pie - that was in a magazine I no longer have, BUT it wasn't in this book."
2,I liked the Kevin Bacon best,"I can see why the movie did not do so well in the movie theater, I was hoping to see Julian do more danciing"
3,not as good as the first one!,The movie was fine to rent but not to buy. The first Footloose was much better than this. The Footloose 2011 story line was not as believable!
5,Footloose,This movie was really good that I would recomend it to my friends and family. For a remake it was great.
3,"Respectable, but lacking","This is one movie that really should not have been remade. The original still holds up just fine, and there is nothing new they could add to justify a remake. On top of that, I felt that most of the characters lost something in the translation. I really didn't have any reason to feel anything for any of them. I don't want to blame the acting, but something with the changes in story or how key scenes were played out just left me wishing I was watching the original instead. In the end the movie is watchable, but I would feel very sorry for anyone who might watch this one having never seen the original, because they probably wouldn't even give the original a chance afterwards... and that is where all the magic of this story is. One last thing to add for argument to watch the original over a remake... Kevin Bacon. Enough said."
5,loved it then..loved it now!!,loved it when it originally came out..loved just as much now!!my favorite line on the movie...your sexier then socks on a rooster!.....LOL
3,I liked it,Color me shocked but I actually liked the movie and I didn't want to.. being all loyal to Kevin Bacon and such. Julianne Hough was really good and I'm surprised because I thought she was terrible in Rock Of Ages. Pretty much a redo of the origional but still worth your time.
5,Great Christmas gift,This was purchased as a Christmas gift but I know my sister will love it since she talks about it alot
3,footloose 2,Best part of movie was Julianne. Way to much like the first movie. Could predict every move. Was exspeting something different to only get the same
4,No Surprises,"If you loved the original Footloose, you will certainly like the update. All of the same elements are present. The story line feels dated, but then who expects originality in a musical? This movie delivers what you would expect - a good cast, good music and excellent dancing. It's fun and entertaining."
4,"Good, but not the original","I love this movie, but still like the original better..... Great comparison, I think they actually studied the original....but brought it to today's reality."
2,Pretty lame remake,Sometimes remakes make sense and are fun to watch and occasionally even surpass the original movie - not this time. This movie felt like it was just going through the motions and wasn't fun to watch.
2,Substandard,"Not the best remake I've seen. Acting was substandard. Main actor was not the best, Ann's Dennis Quade has been better."
3,Modern Day 2012 Garbage Re-Make,"Definitely made for today's generation. Different sountrack from the original, Ren's Mom is gone, Ren's from some other city (not Chicago), his friend Willard is very hard to understand. Dennis Quaid as Ariel's father seemed stiff in this, it just wasn't moving fluidly along. Ariel's boyfriend looked about 30 yrs. old. When playing ""chicken"" they used a school bus? LOL. Beaumont is now Bomont?Rap garbage music infiltrated this movie, not the place for it, along with line dancing to rap music? Odd. Some movies just should be left alone as originals. Where'd most of the original music go? They replaced it, ugh! Go with the 1984 version. The soundtrack rocked and so did the acting, dancing and the movie! I'm sure those that are 30 yrs. and younger will like this movie. I'm early 40's and have better taste than this. I thought I'd give it a shot. Hey they remade True Grit and it wasn't a flop so I've heard. Footloose- It's ok to pass a couple of hours, but not a keeper."
2,"Too poorly motivated and too contrived to earn my ""but in""","Not without its moments - actors Kenny Wormald (Ren) and Miles Teller (Willard) have good chemistry, especially their first meeting (which plays out like a ""meet cute"") - and there's some clever re-imagining of the classic songs, but overall too poorly motivated and too contrived to earn my ""but in"" to the movie. I mean, Rusty is obviously into Ren when she sees him and she's a way better choice than Ariel as a girlfriend but then all of a sudden out of nowhere Rusty and Willard are together? Where did that come from? Just needed to get the good girlfriend out of the way so the hero ends up with the girl the script calls for without looking like a total idiot for passing up the good girlfriend?"
1,NO CLEAVER TITLE. JUST WATCH THE ORIGINAL!!!!,"HOLY CRAP!!!! i can't believe how they desecrated this film! i'm not a troll. i actually wasted 2 hours of my life watching this because i was forced to on a plane and now i wish the airline would give me my money back for making me suffer. story was flat. characters were flat. acting was flat. ren, willard, ariel, ariel's older boyfriend rusty, ariel's father the preacher, everyone lacked the personality and edge that set each one apart in the first one and you are left with a complete and total feeling of just plain blah and disgust. avoid this flaming pile of dog crap at all cost and get the original."
2,Pointless remake,"Not sure what the point of this remake was. We only watched it because some of it was filmed in my partner's home town. Dennis Quaid was not at all convincing as a Southern Minister. Much of the movie was similar to the original (again, what was the point of making a remake?) Where there were differences, some of them were insignificant and others were just plain stupid: the game of chicken on the tractors in the original was replaced by a school bus race that turned into a smash up derby. Really???"
2,bowel loose,"I want to be clear the only reason this film is getting 2 stars is because I like the remake of some of the songs and willard danced better in this remake.I have never bothered to review a film before, but I felt after watching this film it was my duty to warn people. the bad acting random lines from old movie, the dance off at a drive in movie theater were all the girls danced like they were swinging on poles ohh wait they did swing on poles. This movie could have been so much better, the 15 people that gave it 5 stars must have been all men and had the film on mute.old movie 5 stars, new movie money better spent on mcdonalds cheese burger, both have fillers, but the burger at least tastes good!"
2,Didn't like the casting,"I'm sure I'm biased because I saw and loved the original. I didn't like the way the characters were portrayed by Kenny Wormaid as Ren, or Julianne Hough as Ariel, or even Dennis Quaid as the preacher dad. Miles Teller as Willard was great. The accents were generally bad. I was bored through most of it. Choreography and dancing were great - but a lot of it was the same as the original. I didn't buy Kenny as the outsider bad boy. Pretty disappointed."
1,Horrendous,"Absolutely ruined the movie. Bad casting, bad acting, bad storyline changes. Save your time and money. If you're a fan of the original, this one will just make you mad."
2,Poor acting; unnecessary remake,"This remake is practically the same as the original except that the acting is awful, the music is not nearly as good, most of these folks cannot dance, and...well, you get the picture.Why???"
1,christmas gift,this is a gift for my granddaughter so I can't rate this DVDI haven't seen it thank you very much
1,Foot loose,I receive this movie on a plain DVD with no cover. It was in a envelope with the title written on it.Was not in any form of original packaging. Could not give as a gift!.
1,junk,Honestly the movie starts off alright but then ends up being horrible throughout.Do not buy or rent this movie pleasel
3,Mediocre,The movie wasn't as good as the original and didn't seem to have the amount of music and dancing as the original.
4,Good movie,"Big fan of the old Footloose. New one is surprisingly good! Acting is quality. The storyline is similar, but not an exact replica. If you liked the old one, watch the new one."
3,New Footloose,"I like that the new version was updated. I was surprised that I would enjoy the movie as much as I did.Both the old and new version are in my opinion ""B"" movies and equally fun.What I didn't like was how the dance sequences were filmed, the camera cut around too much and you only caught glimpses of them dancing.You're going to enjoy the movie and kick up your heels to the music!"
5,awesome,I grew up watching the original and was a little concerned how this one was going to come out. I was presently surprised and my kids enjoyed it as well.
4,Cut Loose Again,"I was a little skeptical about this remake. but i was very surprised on how well it was made. this movie ended up being pretty good (thanks to denis quad for being such a great actor) i thought that the cast was excellent. i can't say that for to many remakes. but the original is still the best. i was a liitle worried about the guy who played willard since chris peen did such an awesome job. but the new guy held his ground. julianne hough did a pretty good job as ariel. kenny wormald was not to bad as ren, but kevin bacon was better. i measn keny did a good job don't get me wrong but kevin was better. the original always is. and last but not least dennis quad was excellent as shaw moore. him and john lithgow are equales. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend that you do. p.s. they should of kept the tractor scene. one thing i do have to say is that they did tell what happend to shaw's son. in the first the just tell you in the movie not show you like in this one."
4,Hated only because its a remake,"After seeing the 2012 Footloose remake last night, I honestly can't see what the big deal is. Is it because it is a remake and therefore evil by existing?All in all it is not a movie to get worked up over. My complaint of the movie is that is too much like the original. While it did try to update some of the events, it did preserve most of the plot and remaking some of the iconic scenes in exacting detail.It should have been a lot more different.Also, while the inclusion of the songs from the first movie was a good move in my estimation, giving them a rockabilly twang does not work for me."
3,Footloose? Classic or new?,"This is not a ""bad"" movie, but then again neither was the '84 version. Although some parts are updated, the movie is almost identical to the original Kevin Bacon movie. Even most of the dialogue is virtually identical, right down to the VW beetle used by Kevin... is it the same one?This has been one of the disturbing trends to movies/shows being ""remakes"" of the originals... hard to improve a good movie / story line in the first place. Not really sure why they bothered. Replaced a cassette tape player with an iPod, the tractor ""chicken"" scene with a bus race, but pretty much the same movie.Other than some ""modernization"" it's the same movie... good, but doesn't warrant more than 3 stars, the original deserves 5, watch both of them, you can hardly tell them apart... Can't give more stars for a ""copy"" of a good movie. Sorry."
3,surprising,"I was ready to have a snarky comment on this movie. Then I watched it. It's worth watching. I never thought I'd say that. The phrase ""Footloose remake"" sounds like the start of a stand up act. And the soundtrack was pretty good, too."
2,Why?,"I don't understand why this movie was even made. It's almost an exact word by word, scene by scene, camera shot by camera shot...remake. Just watch the original, it has much more charm and heart than this one."
4,good for a remake,I was surprised that I really did like this movie. Usually don't like remakes. The only part is I don't think the dancing was as good. Really like Willard and the uncle.
3,Chic flick,"Not bad for a chic flick. I'm not a fan of singsong dance movies, if that's your thing you'll probably love it."
2,Michelle Byus,I didn't watch the movie til the end. The music was no good and it ruined the movie.Not as good as original Footloose.
2,Terrible,This movie commits the worst crime: making footloose boring and unoriginal. Instead of re-imagining the movie we get the exact same one with poor covers of the songs. Why not just watch the original?
1,Footloose remake,"I had to turn this off, couldn't even finish it. I think it's hard to improve on the original. But as soon as Ren went into the separation of church and state, that was it for me. So tired of endless political correctness. And the story changed so much from the beginning....just didn't like it."
1,Bad Remake of a Good Movie,"This film was pretty terrible. There was little dancing and the acting was abominable. Because of so much traffic on Amazon, we never got the HD verstion."
3,The new footloose,"Well, for the most parts the movie was a remake of the first...same language, same hits, same songs. There were a couple things that lost the movie for me....the scene in the warehouse with Wren dancing...the first one he was angry, but never vandalised anything. He didn't have to here.As for the quality of the HD. I have a great TV and downloaded this through Amazon HD, the movie was by no means HD. If was hard to view, especially during anytime that there was a lot of motion....during a dance movie, that is a lot of the time. It became almost pixalated, little blocks of pictures. It never tracked to clear itself up but the viewing quality was more like ONE star.Makes me miss my DVD,"
4,Awesome!!!!,This was a great feel good movie. I liked that it showed the young people standing up for what they believe in a positive way. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is I would like to have seen more dancing. I loved the message.
5,Must own,"Went to see this the weekend it came out. My wife and I loved it. They took the origninal film and added to it. More humour, better story telling.. Fantastic. This is a must have. I hope it will be released in time for Christmas, as my wife promptly told me exiting the cinema its on her Christmas list.."
1,pointless remake,"a repeat of the same movie you saw in the 80's, only the original had better actors, better soundtrack and had more heart. this is just trying to make money off the name, almost scene by scene like the original, same dialogue with some added new things here and there to make it more modern. this movie has no soul. avoid it and watch the original."
1,Skip this terrible remake and see the Bacon version.,"Downloaded for wife who like the Bacon version a lot. BUT this??? Girl is hot for sure but guy is no Bacon in any way. Why was he cast in this?? Slow, prodding. If you interested in Footloose see the Bacon version. This version is not recommended at all."
3,This review may or may not change,"I saw and LOVED the original. When I saw the preview for this movie, I nearly wanted to rip my eyes out! I am hoping that they did NOT butcher the original just to make a quick buck. Footloose is almost, not quite but almost, on a level with Grease NOT Grease 2 btw. However, the original Footloose had soooo much dancing, great moves, self expression, and GREAT songs that all ages could enjoy. I am curious to see the remake, HOWEVER, if the preview is actually how the movie will be...I will give a bad review...a very bad review. So if you're like me and loved the freedom of expression and originality that the original footloose brought...watch the preview because I'mma wait a bit. So keep your eyes pealed for my updated review AFTER I watch and hope for the best =)"
4,New Footloose,"This Footloose is a good movie, but nothing compares to the original with Kevin Bacon. There is a good soundtrack to this one."
3,"was ok, but not as good as the original","The update was good in some ways, but I only found myself wishing for the version that I grew up, which seems rougher around the edges. This version was a bit too produced/smooth, from the movie to the soundtrack. Great for a fun night where you don't want to expend too much brain power."
4,I missed Kevin Bacon but was pleasantly surprised,"Enjoyed this far more than I expected to. I'm a big fan of Kevin Bacon, and I feel like a traitor saying I liked this movie, but I gotta be honest. Good cast, good music, overall well-done dance movie."
2,Why Mess with Perfection,"I think it hurts Hollywood to give new movies a chance - choosing to stick to formulaic hits that worked in the 80s - and regurgitating them for todays audience. Why mess with what was perfection? Not every film needs a ""remake"", several""sequels"" or now the addition of ""prequels"". Take a chance on less grand productions and make some of these Indy filmmakers box office gold. This movie was almost an exact take on the 80s version with none of the real chemistry or acting chops (K. Bacon). Two thumbs dowm.....and two big toes!"
5,Updated but stuck to original,"I was leary about getting this movie, but I absolutely LOVE how they kept it so close to the original. What I really liked is how they changed Uncle Wes to be more laid back, giving the little girls much more acting in the movie, and most of all how they brought Vi into a more outgoing woman, rather than seeing her (in the original) just sit back and keep her mouth shut. Overall, I absolutely love this movie, but still watch the original now and then too. And the soundtrack to this updated version is absolutely fantastic!!"
3,"Decent to watch, but looses the themes of the original.","The original Footloose is about loss, recovery and morality. While this version keeps fragments of these themes, it has more to do with religion and politics. For me, this makes the difference between an amazing story and an average one.It's still worth watching, but I do not think it has the impact or poignancy of the original movie."
3,pleasant surprise,"I wasn't sure what to expect about this movie, but it was a pleasant surprise. The movie was not quirky or cheesey. It was a nice carefree movie."
2,Kevin Bacon & original cast have nothing to worry about!,This movie is ok if you are watching it for free and there is nothing else you to do. If they would have remade it like the original it may have been better but trying to add in details from the 2000's made the movie cheesy. The cast was beautiful and made the watching tolerable but the essence of the movie was ruined with the new details.
3,Not very impressed.,I know it is not the original but I expected it to be a little better. Wish directors wouldn't change the story line of movies when they do a re-make.
1,lame,"if you saw the original, don't for a second think that this is any sort of compliment. bad music versions, and even worse dancing."
3,Not the original,It was worth watching but there could have been more dancing. The original was much better.Not one of those movies that I would watch again.
5,Fun Movie,"Grew up on the corny 1984 version and refused to see this version in the movies, I thought ""how can you remake Footloose?"" but then I rented it and loved it!! It's fun and just as corny as the original. Footloose isn't meant to be an Oscar nominated film, so don't watch it expecting that. The soundtrack, I like the changes that they made to that too."
1,"Worst remake of a classic, ever","There are no redeeming qualities of this movie. They used the same script, same setting, same technology; heck, they used the same dance moves, and the same vw beetle! The only change in this movie, except for a few minor bits and pieces, is the sub par actors! Wow. I have never written a scathing review, and this is more time than I have to spare spent on this type of activity, but I am so disappointed."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,Although I almost always detest the movie industry remaking movies that are the ultimate classic and original works this remake is worth watching. I loved the 80s music from the original soundtrack and was happy that the remake chose to keep the original soundtrack - with a little twist. The dancing isn't just grinding (which sums up what our generation's dancing consists of these days) and the characters back stories seem stronger. Way to go!
4,GOOD,Good remake of a classic Kevin Bacon movie. Followed storyline. My children loved it. recommend to all ages. would buy again
2,Footloose and not so fancy free...,"We rented the movie because we loved the original when it came out, and were extremely disappointed to find that it was a mediocre remake of the original 80's classic. The acting was stiff, the dancing was ho-hum and the character seemed to be trying to play the original actors playing the characters. The movie missed a great opportunity to refresh a classic 80's movie and reinvigorate it for the next generation and instead left you with the impression that it was directed by a bunch of high school students. I am glad we only rented it."
3,No Fighting Willard.,"It wasn't too bad a remake. I really liked some of the new actors and still preferred some of the old ones like Bacon. I liked that they didn't add too many new dance styles with people just constantly break dancing all over like most new dance movies these days. I do wish they would have kept it back in that time era though, i find it hard to believe a town would pass a no dance law in 2011. However, all in all it was a pretty decent remake."
1,Worst Movie Ever! Butchered the original.,"This movie doesn't even deserve one star. It was a train wreck, so bad I couldn't stop watching because I thought it just had to get better at some point. Nope. And boy did they butcher the original in every way possible. I had to immediately watch the original after seeing this version just to get it out of my head. Don't bother with this remake - just watch the original. And if you happen to have seen this and thought it was bad, please watch the original. It truly is a classic. Come on Hollywood - is their anything original in there anymore? Yikes."
1,Garbage,"Anyone who thinks this is a good remake should be committed. The acting is a joke. The Preacher is pathetic and weak, not a domineering presence like in the first one. Ariel is self centered and uninteresting. Chuck is barely even a rival, and Ren is impossible to empathize with as he comes off as disrespectful and unnecessarily cocky, like a lot of kids nowadays. This movie is like watching a poorly directed bubble gum commercial, and would actually make a great example of what not to do in a movie, as though they've basically stuck with the original storyline, the scenes utterly lack the poignant moments and emotions of the first one, and the dialogue just tries to explain the story so much that it is terribly unrealistic, unlike the first one. It's a good indication of what ridiculous taste this country has now, as it really seems to have no heart and soul like the first one did. It's sad to see that people don't know the difference."
5,Excellent Remake!!!,"I was 18 when Footloose came out; I've watched this movie many many times. My friends and I had alot of dance parties and we wore this soundtrack out so I was a little worried about what Hollyweird was going to do to this movie; knowing the usual garbage they put out. But I have to say this was a great surprise. They had alot for the original movie with some new stuff so you didn't know exactly what was coming next. Chris Penn was excelent in the original and it was hysterical watching Willard learn to dance however the guy who played Willard in this version did an excellent job and it was just as funny watching him in those scenes. Still a fun movie; ended up dancing at the end, as usual. And it was great to hear Quit Riot again; haven't heard that song in a very long time. Two thumbs up!"
4,Pretty darn good,"As a fan of the original I didn't know if I would like the remake, but it was faithful enough to the original (music and all) that I enjoyed the similarities while appreciating the updates. I agree - better than I expected!"
1,Does not compare to the classic,"I rented this movie with high hopes of seeing a great remake of a great classic. I was very disappointed. Maybe it would have been different if I had not seen the original, but for me this version just doesn't compare and was very difficult for me to sit through.They did make some changes to ""modernize"" it a bit for today's youth, but I felt those efforts were corny and lacking. Even the efforts to try to mimic the original version were corny. I was also disappointed that Ren's mom was not included in this version. Overall, a huge disappointment for me.Sometimes it's best to allow a classic just remain a classic..."
1,Not Good,"Not to our liking. We like dancing type movies, but this was crude. We watch just a few minutes of it."
3,footloose,Horrible remake! First off classics are made to be left alone this just goes to show you Hollywood has no idea how to make a good movie anymore. I mean visuals don't make a moviehowever special effects is there to take the movie on a journey with good story line not be the storyline because storyline was rushed just to sell another picture.Case in point the girl with the dragon tattoo I mean come on guys really. Noomi rapace made that movie better than an international movie should have been. Daniel Craig was good as well as rooney but it just to me lost something in the cast that made the movie. Julianne huff is very pleasent on the eyes but the movie was crap compared predecessor. Ms huff will have a good carreer I think though.
3,Not much different from first footloose,"Its like watching the first footloose with a different cast.The first was a little more exciting this movie you knew what would happen,and when."
2,Horrible. Just horrible.,"I was ""forced"" by a friend to watch this movie. It was horrible, especially in comparison to the original one. And that's saying something. Cheesy acting, cheesy script."
3,Worth seeing,I liked the first one the best. Enjoyed seeing julianne in this one. Not a bad movie but needed a little more of something.
2,Derivative,"This movie is completely direvative of the 1984 movie. I understand it is intended for the youth of today, however, aside from some variation in music, most songs from the 1984 movie turned into country-western sound, the script sticks very close to the original. It seems to me that dusting off the older movie is a much more enticing movie for viewers of all ages."
1,Footloose,"Not good at all, yes it was current with music styles but nothing to compare with original. This just did nothing for me and my children ages 22,19 and 13 they did not like either. Kevin Bacon is the man, no comparison...."
1,remake??!!,"This remake is not good as original one. Poor actors, boring, more violent and less country than original one. Don't buy, just rent it."
2,Errors In the Ambient Century,"I bought this book having read a review in ""The Wire"" magazine, the review said the book was bad, but I did'nt believe it and bought it. I have since read it and can honestly say that I have never read a book with so many factual mistakes in it. As the writer of a ""History of Electronic Music"" for a magazine and a lecturer in Computer music I would suggest that you do not buy this book until all the errors have been corrected. A typical example, ""Robert Fripp studied JG Bennett at Sherborne House, Dorset"", the Sherborne House where he studied Bennett is in Gloucestershire,near Cheltenham. Another ""EMS produced the ""Portobello"" synth, it was in fact called the PUTNEY. There are many more mistakes which makes the book difficult to recommend to my students or indeed anyone else until such time as it has been corrected."
2,Missed opportunity!,"Upon merely skimming through the index, I came upon numerous errors, as have the other reviewers. I list a couple that I spotted with ease:Incredibly, there seems to be no mention at all of Isao Tomita, at least according to the contents and index.Wendy Carlos has never owned or used a Moog System 55.Giorgio Moroder didn't use a drum machine in anger until at last 1981, when the Linn LM-1 was released. The drums and percussion on all the groundbreaking 1970's Moroder/Bellotte recordings was provided by drummer Keith Forsey or through the use of Moog synthesizer modules. It was a tape loop of Forsey's kick drum that provided the only real drum sound on 'I Feel Love'.The inaccuracies in this book made me refrain from buying it, which was a shame since the effort was clearly well-intentioned. Roll on a properly error checked new edition!"
2,simplistic arrangements,"Although it says these songs are done by an orchestra, it sounds more like someone on a fancy keyboard."
5,Healthy Eating for Life For Women,"This book will show how easy life changes can help you improve your overall health. From easing menstruation cramps to strengthening your bones, to losing weight, you'll find it all in this concise, easy-to-read guide. It's a perfect gift for all women. It also has over 100 mouth-watering recipes."
4,Healthy Women,"Every woman, wants to look good and feel great all through their lives and if they don't find everything helpful in this book but take some tips away then what more can you ask?Today more than ever it is important to look towards a healthy way to live your life.Nina Bagnall"
2,a book with a little too much hype and some interesting claims,"This book has provided a lot of useful information about nutrition. However, I think its title is somewhat misleading in that it doesn't capture the book's very strong PRO-VEGAN stance on all nutrition. I also don't see it as very balanced in discussing any common difficulties or necessary precautions that are often associated with a vegan diet. Finally, I really don't appreciate the authors' constant reference to ""making a few SIMPLE changes in your diet"" or their ""delicious"" recipes. I don't agree that the changes they are talking about are ""a few"", nor are they ""simple"", but they require a complete and thorough revamping of an average person's diet plus a possible increase in grocery spending. And whether or not something like soy milk or beans is ""delicious"" is very subjective to say the least..."
5,Best Lasagna Pan Ever,"This pan is the best lasagna pan I've ever had. It's heavy and cooks the lasagna beautifully. Lighter pans tend to brown too much. Plus, this pan is very good looking on the table. The handles are handy and the pan is large."
1,Probably not worth your money,"I got very little out of this book. I think it's far too shallow to be of any practical use. There is a slight amount of theory in the first two chapters, but after that it's just a bunch of ""recipes"" for simulating the various topolgies. These ""recipes"" don't contain much useful information. If you're a beginner, you'll get lost because so much is left out. If your already an experienced power supply designer, you probably already know everything covered here. The CD has some good demo software, but you can download that stuff yourself for free."
1,Waste of Money,"There is a lot of clever advertising surrounding this book, but I found this book utterly useless. I was expecting to see a lot of sample code and examples of the various topologies: buck , boost, forward etc. If you interested in learning the spice language then I recommend one of the books by Muhammad H. Rashid,instead."
4,Good for a break,"This product does not last as long as some other 24 hr products, but seemed to work well enough to break the cycle of using the same drug every day."
5,Great Product - Great Price,This is a very effective antihistmine for me. This is a great product at a great price.
4,ALergie Doggie,It is hard to find Clemastine over the counter. This is the highest recommended allergy medication (vet source) for my pooch.
5,Better than expected.,"This is not like a factory original, but it is pretty darn good. I recommend it to anyone whose steering wheel is a bit rough."
2,Labor Intensive,I checked the reviews before ordering and noticed that it took another reviewer took 4 hours to install. I AGREE! It is not wide enough. I did not realize that there was different widths. The picture shows a smooth texture on the leather. It is NOT! I am truly disappointed
1,waste of money,yah it taste good but i finished a bottle and saw no difference at all ever since i took it i felt like all my energy was drained and after i stopped i felt like i had more energy
1,tacky and pointless,"I checked this book out of the library rather than buying it, thankfully. Virtually every pattern in this cheesy book is available on the author's (equally cheesy) website for FREE, with links to buy materials to make the projects directly from the author. How genius. The information in this book is so fundamental that it is laughable, and easily available for free on the internet with minimal effort. This is just a really dumb book."
1,Sterile and Boring,"Ektomorf = the Hungarian's answer to overworshipping 90's Sepultura and Soulfly so much that they make a tribute band that demonstrates no creativity or originality in their music, and instead have to take the formula, water it down with idiotic lyrics, and have it given bad reviews like this one. Avoid at all costs. There are lots of better bands on Nuclear Blast."
3,what did you expect?,so how could anyone emulate soulfly and (recent) sepultura and NOT be a nu metal band?
1,F**k You Too,"Review by Tyler Wagnon:Try to imagine a Hungarian band trying to emulate Soulfly and Sepultura. Now try to imagine it being more boring than you ever thought possible. This whole album is full of lame nu-metal groove and even has a song called ""F##k You All"". What a f##king joke. Get this $hit away from me."
5,AWESOME AJ STYLES BEST EVER,This is my favorite wrestler and I plan on getting more than one of these because this figure rocks. He is wearing his blue attire and it looks AWESOME. I just wish it didnt have the lever on the back but besides that it is AWESOME.
2,worst wrestler ever,Dont get the AJ Styles wrestler. The lever on the back is stupid. You cant even wrestle with it on the back of it.the WWE wrestlers are way better than the AJ styles. Dont waist your money. Get the WWE wrestles.
1,wwe rocks,"How many times do I have to tell you that tna is not good enough to be a show. WWE has so many good wrestlers like: Triple H[ten time champion],Kurt Angle[only olimpic gold medalist in wrestling history,undertaker and John Cena.I never saw Jeff Hardy wrestle on tna anymore stupid kid. WWE just has a way better brand. Tna stinks."
1,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's goin' on?","Look, TNA figs are fine. They're made my Toybiz, former makers of the fantastic Marvel Legends toyline, so the pose-ability,likeness to source material, and sculpting will be very good. What's gotten me confused is this: why are people arguing about a Wrestling action figure review? I don't get it. Frankly, I'm not a ""kid"", I'm 16; and I have never seen anything as idiotic as this. But, that said, this is a decent figure."
5,LOVE IT!,"I love this book. Brains are unbelievably fascinating, and this book covers everything, including philosophy, stories, anecdotes, humor, and brain facts that are downright startling. It is an amazing book, and so well-written it is hard to put down. It is not an easy book, but it is fantastic. Highly recommended for anyone who has the slightest interest in brain research."
2,politically correct drivel,extremely politically correct and left of center. the only excuse for purchasing this book is as required reading for a basic psych class.presentation of info is fair and would merit a three star grade without the constant calling for socialized medicine.
4,Worthy CD,"Lots of space, and wonderful improvisation make this a very good CD. After many listenings it has really sunk in. At first I found it a little disconcerting, but after some late night driving with this in the CD player - I think I finally have comne to understand what's going on.My only regret is this CD could have been a 5 star for me. But it's not. Why? Because I wish Paul Bley had been on piano. He really knows how to use space. Mike Cain is good, but Bley would really have elevated this to superb. Still, A wonderful effort!"
4,Understated,"I listened to this CD several times when I first purchased it and nothing moved me. After a few years I have just revisited this very understated and controlled series of mood pieces and now things are jelling and the total package is sinking in. For me the CD begins at ""Priestesses Of The Mist"" - a contemplative and atmospheric piece that slowly builds, then subsides. ""Jack In"" shows DeJohnette's skills to the max; this is the fastest paced and most syncopated cut; the use of space to shape the lines by Michael Cain can sometimes be frustrating. ""From the Heart"" shows the group improvising through many melodies and working over several themes, again without ""raising its voice."" This CD takes time to get used to; I would advise you stick with it and it will grow on you. One has to accept this for what it is --- a compiliation of improv works, very exacting and deep in mood, but nonetheless rewarding for those who play it more than once or twice."
5,"Great Calue, Great Glasses","OK, if you look VERY closely you won't confuse these glasses with ones that sell for 2x or 3x the price, but if you entertain and want very nice crystal glasses that feel good in your hand, but for which you won't cry a river if one gets chipped or broken and needs to be replaced, then these glasses are absolutely for you!"
3,Glass a little thick,"This is a decent glass, not a great one. The glass is thicker than I would like. It is a good party-ware stem (probably durable and stands up to the dishwasher) but I really would not consider this a stem for really evaluating delicate wines. All things said, its OK and definitely sometime I will get a lot of use from."
1,Cheap...,"This ENTIRE BRAND of glasses feel VERY VERY cheap. I'm not a 'wine snob', just ur average wine drinker. They were thick, and plastic!!!! Not glass; very disappointing...I also bought another set in this brand for a birthday gift around the same time, and this was very embarrassing....would suggest not to buy"
4,"A good book for fans, but if you are new to the show....","This is a really good book series for B5 fans. It makes a great companion & fun reading after you have watched each show. But I would recommend it mainly for those that have seen the series & are watching it again. The reason I say that is because it is laced with spoilers all throughout the commentaries. That's fine if you've seen the whole thing already, but it stinks if you are watching it for the first time. If you don't mind that sort of thing...go for it, but this is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. For a good ""non-spoiler"" companion guide, I highly recommend The Babylon File: The Definitive Unauthorized Guide to J. Michael Straczynski's TV Series Babylon 5 by Andy Lane Versions 1 & 2. He shows no mercy sometimes. If he does or doesn't like the show, he let's you know. But it's a blast to read."
4,Essential Reading for the B5 Viewer,"The Babylon 5: Season by Season guidebooks are an essential read for fans of the TV series. Containing photos, interviews, essays, and in-depth rundowns of each episode, each book is indispensable for B5 vets and newbies alike. Strongly recommended."
5,Polish heart,"Madam Podles is beathtaking, deep Artist, sensitive and dramatic. But that pianist sucks, no soul in his playing! Sadly..."
5,One of my favorite AT books,"I really enjoyed this book. I like that it is by an ""older"" woman like myself with a woman's perspective. She really put me on the trail with her and the other hikers. I especially liked how she had kept up with her hiking partners and gives a long list at the end telling about them and what they have done since leaving/completing the AT."
4,Worth a read - twice!,"I recently read this book for the second time. I have read many AT thru-hiking books because I hope to one day throw off these 9:00 to 5:00 shackles and attempt it myself. This is one of the better books out there. I like to read about more trail details so that's why only 4 stars. However, it was a great read."
5,Search For Animal Chin Special Edition,"I really enjoyed this DVD, seeing the original Bones Brigade today was way cool. This DVD came with the making of Animal Chin, and seeing all that went into the making of this film was awesome. It comes with the Bones Brigade commentary, as well as the Bones Brigade Video Showtunes. I highly reccomend this to any fan of The Bones Brigade, and/or skater that love the whole original Powell Peralta family."
5,Taking me back to good times,"I was stocked to see that you could not only get Animal Chin on DVD, BUT, they went further and made this out of sight Special Edition! And even a free Search for Chin sticker! Seriously, if you grew up skateboarding around the time Animal Chin was the must watch video, then you must get a copy quick! Its so worth it! And I thank god for here as many stores in my area didn't even carry this masterpiece! Two thumbs up from this guy!"
1,This should never have been printed,"This book is so poorly written that after just 60 pages I wonder if I should even continue reading. Even if you get past the multitude of typos, incorrect grammar and inconsistencies, the total lack of structure makes this a difficut book to read. In short, it is a work of an amateur writer. That he may be a subject matter expert I don't contest, but he surely makes for a poor writer. The book is very disjointed and this makes following the reasoning almost impossible. I am very sorry I invested in this and had I had a choice I would have given it no stars."
1,Caribbean Workout - Big Disappointment,"Since I find background music so energizing, I assumed that this video would include Caribbean music. However, there really is no music to speak of and the instructor's directions are too fast and unpredictable for me -- I have only tried the low-impact. I'm sure if I watch it long enough I will learn her routine, but I don't feel at all inspired to continue with it."
2,Not for a beginner,I bought this video thinking it was for a beginner and it is not. If you are not familiar with aerobics this is not the video to start with.
5,Better than buying it at the exhibit!,"I bought the ""Full Fledged"" book at the Tut exhibit because I didn't know that this one was available. All I got for another $15-$20 was a disc of the audio tour. It doesn't help much when you have left the exhibit. Other than the disc, the books are identical.I bought this for my son who went with us, he was very pleased and I was even more pleased at the price. Plus, I didn't have to lug it around NYC for hours after buying it."
4,Better price at Amazon,Good book to remember the exhibit. Just saw Tut at the Field museum. Museumstore price was nearly $50. Could not wait to get home and order the book.
4,Great for Card Making,"I have to disagree with the previous reviewer who said that this glue does not dry. It does dry, and relatively quickly.Previously, I was using Elmer's Memory Book Glue Pen to glue all of those little infuriating pieces together to make Cricut cards, but I always had a problem with wrinkling and warping. Eve drying the cards smooshed between books resulted in somewhat warpy cards. This glue solves this problem. It's thicker than other glues, and therefore takes some effort to get out of the tube (the only reason I deducted a star) but it's easy to control since it comes out slowly and the results are fantastic! No more warpy cards!"
2,Don't know if this works...,"It is not very comfortable. I will continue to try it, but don't know if it helps. My husband cannot confirm whether it lessens the snoring or not. My five-year-old grandson said I look a bull (with a ring in its nose). Nice, huh?"
3,zacapañecos a todo dar,This is good music para aquellos guatemaltecos proud of nuestra musica cumbiañera...ritmo y sonido from guatemala querida...this album will make you dance como en los bailes que hacemos los chapines...if you like la pachanga y el buen ritmo zacapañeco...this album is what you need...hope you enjoy it como lo disfruto yo.
2,Disappointing,"An interesting, creative premise poorly executed. The plot develops too slowly; the motivations and personalities of the characters are never well developed."
2,Mucho ruido y pocas nueces,"Es una lectura entretenida y hasta ahí.La mínima ambientación histórica para hacer el relato fluido, el facilismo de la Inquisición para truncar personajes repentinamente, una buena parte del libro es la ""transcripción"" del alegato del protagonista en el juicio al que se lo somete.Y a partir de allí el argumento ya no es tal, sino una larga, laaarga nota al pie.No espere demasiado el lector."
2,Una novela que nunca alcanza a despegar,"El anatomista es uno de esos raros libros en los que la información de la cuarta de forros es más interesante y se encuentra mejor escrita que el libro en sí mismo. El guión es ingenioso, y recuerda lejanamente a ""El perfume"" de Patrick Suskind, pero donde Suskind acierta en la descripción de los ambientes de la época, el detallado dibujo de los personajes y sus obsesiones, y sobre todo, en la elegancia de la narración, Federico Andahazi fracasa, al leerse su libro básicamente como un guión de cine inacabado, con tres o más estilos narrativos entremezclados. No hay transportación del lector a la Venecia del siglo XVI, no hay buen manejo de la intriga (el final es predecible) y no hay tampoco ese ritmo trepidante que caracteriza a las grandes novelas.Al final, la obra fracasa en distintos niveles, y nos queda una sensación como que Federico Andahazi le dio vueltas y vueltas a una sola idea que tenía en mente, pero sin un desenlace satisfactorio."
2,Malfunctioned after only a few uses,"This is great for cutting potatoes. However, I use onions in several meals a week, and after only a few uses, one of the blades started coming loose, bending, and cutting into the plastic cutting board below. I was no longer able to effectively use my Nicer Dicer.However, the booklet says it has a 5 year warrantee. So I sent it back to the company.WARNING - if you do not buy the Nicer Dicer directly from the Nicer Dicer company, they will NOT honor the warrantee.The quality of the product does not match the price! Buyer Beware!"
3,Disappointing............,"While this works fine for onions and peppers and some herbs - it is a DISASTER with midwest, garden-fresh, juicy tomatoes. What a mess; and yes, I did the recommended wetting the blade and had the skin the correct orientation. I had some success using the less juicy Roma tomatoes but the clean up after any tomatoes is just too much work....back to my knife for salsa and bruschetta prep."
4,NOT AS EXPECTED,"Good product, easy to use. Cutting blades are not too good. OK with onions but not with tomatoes."
4,Can't find replacement parts,I bought the Nicer Dicer a few years ago and have enjoyed using it. But now one of the clamps has broken and I can't find where to contact the company for a replacement part.
4,"One goood, one bad","The first Nicer-Dicer we bought has been excellent. The design makes it easy to clean; disassemble the unit and it naturally cleans the support blocks. We have had it for about two years, and it has not had any problems or failures.The second unit I bought for and had shipped to my daughter, and it arrived with multiple pieces cracked. She is waiting for an OK to return it. This, of course, is time and effort consuming, and leaves a bad taste for the product. She also complained that it could not dice onions. I expect that she had too large a piece and suggested that cut it into a smaller sections. And place the cut side against the blades.Maurie"
2,Limited As To What it can Do.,"I bought my dicer for one dollar at Goodwill. That is about a true value of this gadget. I found if I peel the red peppers it will work on the fine dice grate. Tomatoes must be really firm to dice them. It works as well as the fancy ""Heavy Duty"" chopper I bought for $169.00 and this device is a time consuming nightmare to clean. I still rely on a sharp bladed knife. I wonder why most gadgets create more work than using basic techniques."
5,Worth every penny.,"Great product, my mom had in for a long time, and I have use it at her home to help her prepare meals. I just got one for myself too! It just cuts the time you spend chopping vegetables. Love it!"
5,Best Apple Chopper EVER!,Enough said. It's a GREAT product for chopping and dicing food/veggies! I believe we have 3 in our family between my mom and my grandmothers.
2,Watch out for tablet monitor problems due to heat from the touch pad!,"I purchased the Gateway CX200X convertable notebook from Gateway direct within the past month. It seems to be exactly the same model as the CX2615. I was very happy with the notebook until I realized that the display was showing an alomost imperceptible defect. I.e., there is an area of the LCD display that rests directly above the touch pad that becomes very overheated when the unit is used in tablet mode - what you will see is a tiny area that glows slightly brighter than the rest of the display. I was afraid that if this persisted overtime that it would permanently damage this part of the monitor. Needles to say that Gateway denied any knowledge of this condition (that I and my IT team discovered) and I was assessed $150 restocking fee for returning the unit. I argued that it was a design problem to no avail.This is obviously a design flaw, but Gateway will never admit it. Beware!"
5,Great DVD,Order arrived on time and am pleased with the video. I will order more videos of this type in the future. I watch them while exercising on staionary bikes and treadmills. Helps the time go by faster.
5,Peaceful and informative,Get to know loons in this serene and interesting dvd. It is informative and well-done and well worth watching.
5,Great book!,"I first encountered this book while working on my Ph.D. many years ago. Now, as a full-time mom to two little ones, I find myself invoking what I learned from this book ALL THE TIME. It is an academic book, so it isn't exactly an easy read. However, this books is one of those classics that reinforces to me why we shouldn't be sending our little ones (2 and 3 year-old) off to preschool. Little kids need dialogue and real word situations to learn.In fact, the knowledge contained in this book is one of the reasons why I am home schooling my children."
1,A Very Difficult Read,"For a book about language and meaning, it is extremely difficult to derive anything from this book! While it includes examples of conversations including young British children and their development, they are only useful if you have had no exposure to children. The remainder of this book is dedicated to explaining how children develop the ability to express and create meaning, but is almost impossible to follow.There are many great sources available for language development, but this is not one of them!"
3,A Fairly decent thriller,Though not lundgren's best film by any means this was a fairly decent thriller that combined seediness of film noir and tension of a psychological thriller.Give Lundgren some credit for playing real person and not trying to be unstoppable action hero.
1,It's as stupid as it sounds,"This is one of those direct to video movies that you will pass over, and with good cause. This mess of a film is so stupid, sexually tame, kinky extreme, and plot pointless that it's a miracle it was even made. I'm sure the book it was based off of was ok but other than that you really must question why bother.Dolph Lundergen plays a guy who returns to his home town because his wealthy brother has been murdered. His wife seems upset and the mother is devasted. the movie takes place in the 1970's so they try to have this old movie feel to it. Try again pal. This movie could of easily of have taken place in 1999 and you would have never known. Any ways Dolph wants to find the killer. So he tracks down some of his brother movements and after viewing this video of his bro in a kinky sex act he goes into the under ground sexual organization. Eventually he finds the killer but you will probably be asleep by then.Don't waste your time."
2,I think Jills just ripped me off!,"Being a BIG fan of director Anthony Hickox, when I saw this movie was available on DVD, I immediately purchased it. However, gone is the trademark Hickox style, eschewing his past ""Waxwork"" style in favour of a more downbeat work. I secretly hoped it would move along like his movie ""Payback"", but no, it just ambles along from one scene to the next. However, Hickox's commentary is great. . . funny and sincere. Dolph Lundgren seems to be lost without a big gun or someone to hit, and one only wishes that Hickox would let him loose with a bazooka or something. The DVD is fine, with a crisp picture, and Hickoxs' direction is as stylish as ever. I hope that he will embrace the DVD format further, as I would like to see commentary's on all of his movies. Now, do I buy the other Hickox/Lundgren movie ""Storm Catcher""... only time and my bank balance will tell . . ."
2,LAME LUNDGREN,"JILL THE RIPPER is set in the world of kinky sex, and with a serial killer who offs men she feels deserve it. Dolph Lundgren offers a pretty lame performance as the hero, an ex-cop who returns to Boston in the 1970s (why there-who knows?) when his high profile brother is brutally slain by the aforesaid Jill the Ripper. The killer's identity becomes pretty apparent early on in the film and Lundgren's attempts to bring emotion to his role as the alcoholic sleuth fail miserably. Even in the fight scenes he has, Dolph seems listless and lethargic. Director Anthony Hickox should have insisted on more passion from Dolph and maybe this film could have become a little more involving."
1,DOLPH LUNDGREN'S WORST MOVIE EVER!,"DOLPH LUNDGREN SINKS TO AN ALL-NEW LOW IN THIS MOVIE. THIS TIME, DOLPH PLAYS A FORMER COP WHO RETURNS TO HIS OLD TOWN IN THE 70S TO INVESTIGATE THE MURDER OF HIS BROTHER. DOLPH GIVES WHAT HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST WOODEN PERFORMANCE OF HIS CAREER IN THIS ONE. ACTIONLESS PLOT REALLY KILLS THIS ONE. EVEN THE BIGGEST DOLPH LUNDGREN FAN WILL HATE THIS MOVIE. NOT EVEN WORTH A RENTAL. SAVE YOUR MONEY INSTEAD."
5,Answers my questions about rug hooking,This book is a beautiful overview of rug hooking and a practical guide for beginners. It gives the basics every new rug hooker needs to know and serves as as inspiration for experienced hookers.
4,heavy duty serious tool,"Pros of this ladle are:-shape: handle is soft and feels ergonomic-measure: 1/2c and 1c mark inside of it-weight: it feels very substantial and ""professional""Sort of cons:-it is stainless steal so it will scratch your pots, if they have some kind of coating and you scape soup from the very bottom. On another side - you probably don't want plastic.-handle seems to be a bit too long, but may be I just don't cook soup in pots tall enough when the length would come handyOverall, a nice addition to your kitchen tools."
2,UNSATISFIED - I RETURNED IT,"While this ladle may be sturdy, it has what I consider to be, a major drawback. The silicone (which has a rubbery feel to it) on the handle begins just 2 1/2 inches above the serving cup, and it is GLUED onto the handle. This means that whatever size pot I use, even a 1 quart saucepan, the silicone portion of the handle would go into my food. I AM DEFINITELY NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. I returned it."
4,One Slight Issue,This matches the stainless utensils I ordered before. I got this for ladleing oatmeal mostly. I'm suprised that the oatmeal seems to bond instantly to the ladle to the point that I can't just rinse it off before putting in the dishwasher. Perhaps there is an issue with stainless and cooked organic rolled oatmeal?
4,A great ladel for a good price,The ladle was actually much better quality than I was expecting for the price. The stainless steel was constructed well. The ladle brings out a good amount of soup when used. The cleaning is quick and I have not had any problems with cleaning on or it tarnishing.
3,way too heavy,"If I were to join Rapunzel (from ""Tangled"") we could be the dynamic duo--she with her cast iron skillet and I with my hefty ladle. This thing is a beast. I'm not sure why ladles are heavy. The handle is designed not to heat up, which is nice, but that long black strip in the center is ugly. The metal is smooth and well-finished but if you are like me, and your ladle serves dual purposes--like soup and sometimes drinks--you will find this unsightly. Great if you need to wield a weapon at the dessert table though."
5,This Christmas Tree Garland is so cute!,"I have two artificial Wizard of Oz Christmas trees. One has more expensive ornaments, Radko, Polonaise, Hallmark...The other has Oz toys, beanies, Madam Alexander toys from McDonalds, and various other little Oz toys.This garland is so cute. I wasn't able to put it around perfectly because there wasn't enough, but here and there it's really cute. It's on the tree with the expensive otnaments."
2,Disappointed,"Pros- Nice leather- 3/4 length fingersCons- Quality. There was one seam beginning to separate before they were even used- Excessive padding. Lots of padding may be a 'pro' to some people, but if you are planning to do heavy lifting where grip can be a challenge, the amount of padding is noticeable- Fit. The fingers are just too snugBottom line- Used them once...that was enough"
1,Worst Pair of Gloves Ever!,"I purchased these gloves based on reviews I read and because of their price. I work out 6 times a week and put heavy use on my gloves and have gone through several pairs from several brands and styles. These were by far the worst!! They fit me horrible, were quickly stretched out and fit loose which caused loss of grip and major discomfort while lifting heavy. They also ripped from the thumb and several finger seams. I have used other brands sold by amazon and although none have been long lasting they were at least pleasant to workout with.I've had them for five months and are not completely worn out, except for the fingers as described above, but I have to get rid of them. I also recently developed a sprain in my wrist which may have been caused by the lack of grip and slipping these gloves gave me.My advice is to STAY AWAY!"
3,Comfy but fragile -- could work for you depending on your needs.,"I've been a personal trainer for more than 12 years, and I've tried dozens of gloves, and here are my thoughts:These are the comfiest gloves in the market. However, since they are super soft, they're also fragile. Thus:-If you're looking for soft, comfy gloves and don't do serious lifting, buy these. These are super comfy and would be 5 stars for you. Perfect for women.-If you lift more than light weights (e.g., if you bench 120+ pounds), do not get these, as these will rip up on you in a week or two. Thus, particularly lousy for heavy lifters. 1 star.Based on this, I'm giving it 3 stars."
2,Disappointed With Durability,"I ordered these based on good reviews, but I was initially disappointed because these gloves came with no wrist wrap. Turns out that was my fault, I needed to order the ones that specified ""wrist wrap."" I was confused because the price with or without wrist wrap was about the same. The real problem is the durability. After 10 weeks of wearing them for an hour a day, four days a week, these are ready for the trash. I probably only washed them 2 or 3 times, because their lifespan seemed to shrink every time I did. These are just poorly made- seams ripping, padding coming out- although the leather grip surface itself is pretty hearty. I was hoping, based on recommendations, I could get six months out of these gloves, but not even close."
3,LIttle tight for a large size.,"The gloves fits not too bad.might of gotten maybe a xlarge if they have it. It foam is comfortable when lift 40+ pounds.The material is like from a basketball husk and is stitched decently. Though they packing is from Wisconsin, the materials made are in china. Go figure. Once i uses these gloves more i'll add changes to this later."
4,Good quality gloves,"These are good quality leather gloves. Some things worth noting are that they are 3/4 finger gloves and will push material down to your palm when you grip something. The 3/4 design is more protective though and will leave more skin on your fingers for the heavier lifts.The stitching looks high quality. The fabric looks high quality. The glove feels good.I give it four stars because it is a very little bit over padded for a 3/4 finger glove. I feel like there is just a small bit too much padding when I pick up weight. A Great buy though with no regrets.UPDATE: Today marks one year of high intensity bodybuilding with this product. Here's the downlow: They are still great and no stitching is falling out. I've actually rubbed part of the elastic web away, but I could easily get another 6-10 months out of these. If they are your style, don't even blink about it, they last!"
1,The newer model is inferior,"I bought these exact gloves 2 years ago, and they were great. Padded, durable, and comfortable. The new model feels lighter, cheaper, and has less padding. Boo!!"
3,OK but smell bad!,"I've had these gloves for about 2 years. I like the fit and padding and they are easy-on, easy-off. The color is more brown than the orange-y color that shows here. But,they literally stink! I wash them regularly, but they always smell like old sneakers. Even my trainer noticed it. I'm online now shopping for a new pair."
2,Disappointing,"I've had these gloves for about a year; use 'em twice a week on average.Fairly quickly, the fabric holding the velcro straps began separating. And more recently, the seam on one of the thumbs has separated the whole length of the thumb. (For the record, I've only washed them once, in cold water on gentle, precisely to keep 'em in good shape for as long as possible.) And finally, the padding [which it turns out I prefer not having in the first place] on the right glove has always been a little bunched at the base of the thumb / palm, and has always hurt a bit during press exercises.I've still got a $10 pair of Harbinger gloves in my gym bag that I used constantly for about five years; they were always more comfortable than the Ocelots, and held up way better."
3,Ocelot has gone down in quality.,"I was excited to find Ocelot gloves on-line through Amazon. I bought my first pair about ten years ago when I was lifting more often. The pattern of the leather is exactly the same, but the thinkness and texture of the leather is not. The leather is stiff and seems to be thinner than the plush soft leather in the older pair. The county of manufacture has changed and that could be the reason for the lesser quality of leather. Hope that Ocelot can get their product back to the quality they had years ago. I will go the a sporting goods store next time and try to fing gloves of a higher quality next time. I would return the gloves if I had an easy method like they have at LL Bean's method of providing a return lable. I'll still using the old gloves since they're not worn through yet and will try the stiff new gloves next."
1,Waste of time if you like comfort.,"I am 6 feet tall 180 and have normal size hands for my size. Only been working out ... 30 years .... these gloves are too small. What are the other reviewers talking about? I bought both the large and the 2XL and they still feel like my hands are being ""squeezed"" like sausages. If you like that, fine. If not then continue the search. Very annoying!"
5,Great Gloves,"Very high quality gloves. I've been using them solid for a few weeks, and they haven't torn or come apart at all, very pleased."
5,"Good Gloves, Great Value","I have a pair of Ocelot gloves that are about 8-10 years old, and after 3 weightlifting sessions a week and occasional use warming up on my heavy bag, I've finally worn out the leather around the wrist. The gloves still work fine for lifting, the palms and fingers still have plenty of cushioning and are comfortable, the gloves just have holes at the bottom of the thumb. These gloves don't cost much, and they are money well spent.They are sized small. The pair I have is XL and I have 8.5 inch hands, which is usually a medium/Large. They are a bit roomy, but the Large(back then) seemed a bit snug."
2,Lasted 3 months,"I used these gloves 4 times a week consistently for 3 months, during which time I noticed a decrease in calluses on my hands, so they did the job better than the cheaper model Harbinger's I used previously. However, the seams around the thumbs started to fall apart around the 3 month mark. If you don't mind purchasing new gloves every 2-3 months, then these will do. Currently shopping around for more durable gloves."
2,Messy Mesh,"These gloves are very comfortable and nicley padded in the right places. However, the quality of mesh that is used is of poor quality and or not sewn well. The fist pair ordered needed to be replaced as the mesh portion of one of the gloves had a hole in it - about one inch in diameter. Amazon was great in sending a replacement pair timely. However, in about 2 months with average usage (maybe 2x a week) the mesh on one of the gloves became unattached at the seam which attached it to the leather. This has only spread and now the glove has a complete hole in it. Poor quality and not a product that I believe will last long."
3,Not bad had better. Little pricey for the quality,I expected the padding to thicker for the price. I was spoiled with my $15 sheik gloves for a few years and these looked similar. They are adequate but for what you are getting the price is a little high. I would shop around.
2,Older ocelots were made better.,"I have owned several pairs of these gloves throughout the years. These are not what they used to be. I cant find these in the store anymore so I went to amazon. When i opened the package i received from amazon not only were the gloves different color, but they are not made nearly as well as they used to be. The leather is cheap and the gloves are totally different now. I mean they are not horrible for the price but whatever changes they made in manufacturing these needs to change. These used to be the best gloves you could buy for the price, now they are just ok."
1,Five out of six gloves for left hand only,I ordered and bought three pairs of the large size gloves. What I was expecting was three right and three left gloves. What I got was five left and only one right glove. The factory really screwed up on this one. Do not purchase these when their quality control of the packaging is so bad. I purchased these through Amazon.
1,Bad News,"Had a pair of these that lasted 5 years and were great...the sewing unraveled, but after 5 years OK.. My new pair unraveled the second time I used them...The new style is bad too...I'm done with this brand."
1,good looking gloves. bad quality,I got this gloves to give as a gift to my workout partner. Not even within 3 weeks of use it seemed that the seams from the thumb started to become apart. After reviewing them closely it turned out that the leather just ripped.Of course my friend didnt want to say anything about since they were a gift and now is too late to get them exchanged.
1,Do you like stained hands ?,"Do not buy these. Unfortunately, like most things these days, the gloves are made overseas in a sweat shop, in this case Pakistan. They are made cheap. The worst part is the dye that was used to color the leather bleeds and bleeds. I have thoroughly soaked these and wrang them out 100 times to try to get the dye out so they won't stain my hands, but no success. You will have brown hands after you workout, and the stains are hard to wash off. I just threw them out after 10 uses and ordered Harbinger Pro gloves."
5,The Best Book for Practitioners,"This is, without a doubt, the best book on communities of practice. It is written for practitioners and contains many real-world examples. The first two chapters on value and structure are extremely interesting and a pleasure to read. Chapter 3, ""The Seven Principles of Cultivating Communities of Practice,"" is worth the cost of the book alone.Chapters four, five, and seven are invaluable for organizations that depend on communities of practice as a key component of their knowledge management strategy. The authors offer guidance on how to create, capture, and transfer tacit knowledge.Michael BeitlerAuthor of ""Stratgic Organizational Learning"""
3,Seems like it never stopped,"I thought the book overall was a fair book, it talked mostly about Communities of Practice in organizations and what they are doing with them. What I felt the book lacked was a good solid foundation or numerous case studies on how to get a Community of Practice started.Overall the book was pretty good but seemed like a lot of repetition of text in the later chapters. I would like to have seen the author provide more real world scenarios throughout the text."
4,Important book - read it,"Communities of Practice are significant. They tend to enable cooperation and innovation without a lot of the constraints that prevail when people are very concerned about who gets credit for success.I learned of this book from the Army's head of Battlefield Knowledge Management, the co-chair of a ""connecting the dots"" CoP to facilitate the sharing of information across government agencies. There is considerable money available for this purpose.Appropriate for standards setting, government interoperability and other task force type of activities, this book is the seminal work on the subject and is required reading. Anyone who is working on projects of any kind, needs to know Wenger's theories and descriptions or practice, especially if one is dealing with knowledge, taxonomy, interoperability and moving a new discipline into fruition. Great for consensus building and shared tasking outside your organizational boundaries."
4,Great Primer,"For those who are tasked to develop Communities of Practice (CoP), this is a great resource AND reference. I plan to keep it in steady rotation for (especially) checking the stages of CoP development and how to facilitate my CoPs through them."
2,Don't be fooled...nothing like the other Total War games!,"I bought this, thinking it would be similar to Rome Total War and Medieval Total War. This couldn't be farther from the truth. A very boring game I wish I could return!The box didn't even come with a guide book--something both other games came with and there are no built-in instructions within the game.A waste of my money."
3,Decent,Was a fine hat but it was kinda stiff and tight. I like my hats looser and kinda hangy. Better for a boy probably
4,Great Toy,"I'm not sure when the other reviews were written but I just received this yesterday as a gift for me 3 year old son. It's a wonderful toy! He LOVES it! There was a great instruction manual that came in the box (VERY easy to assemble!!) and none of the scenery papers were folded. They were all straight, unfolded in a protective plastic wrap. Maybe the company heard the complaints and fixed all the complaints because I have no complaints about this toy! My son loves playing with it and drawing on it. He even woke up his dad at 5am to play with it again. It will also be great for him as he gets older and can draw more things. There is a great alphabet play that tells you what to draw. The magnets are so fun too and so are the different scenery pages. Great toy!!The only bad thing is the eraser is a tiny yellow sponge that does not work at all. I use a big kitchen sponge, wet it and squeeze out most of the water and use that. It works much better!"
2,Too Busy,Was cute the first day. My 5 and 6 year olds liked listening to the sounds of the magnets. They won't move the background screens around. They just liked the noises. A little boring.
2,Better comic than calendar,This selection is not nearly as funny as the Non-Sequitur books and strips that I am used to seeing.
5,A gift,I have all of the Lilian Jackson Braun 'The Cat Who' books and bought this one for my daughter to read. So far she hasn't said whether she liked it or not.
1,I should have read further....,"I love and have all of the ""Cat Who..."" series with the exception of ""60 Whiskers"" which I'm waiting to come out in paperback. Since I've read all the books, I was itching to continue enjoying the exploits of Qwill.... I bought this book only to find out that I have the 3 novels (3 tales) already... Next time, I won't be so hasty..."
5,Lilian Jackson Braun,"Braun is truly one of my favorite authors. Excellent read as always. I wish ""Cat Who Smelled Smoke"" had been published."
3,The Cat Who,"Interesting book, this is my first read of this author and probably will read more of the series."
2,only 2 good songs on this cd for me.,"beachball and everytime are the olnly good songs on this disc, in my opinion. beware"
2,Dissapointed,"After watching videos from duplicolor, I was excited to try this product. Color is very weak... I purchased Red, Black and Blue and found all colors to be too weak to be useful. I took all unused cans to the paint recycling center and resorted to plan B. I printed stickers on 8.5"" x 11"" sheets and tiled my graphics onto my car."
5,A+++++++++++++,"Exactly what I wanted. Nickel strings with Ernie Ball legacy of great strings. Super fast shipping.Strings are nice and snappy, tone excellent for Blues. Thanks"
5,Soft silky hair,My stylist had this product and used it on my coarse dry hair. I use this on a regular basis and my hair is smooth and silky. I love the smell (cocoa butter) and so does everyone else. Great deal !
2,One Hospitals view,"I have read about half of this book before I got so fed up that I put it down. It is focused on two hospitals that merged. One of the hospitals was a stellar nurse oriented hospital, the other more money saving oriented. It discussed in depth the problems that came up between the two. Although these two hospitals may show what is happening in the industry, it felt more like an internal study of the merger of these hospitals rather than a commentary on the ""Dismantling of Nursing"". Very disappointed. Waste of money."
1,YAWN!!!,I bought the book for a collegiate course and hated every boring line of it. The entire book is about nurses whining.
5,Great Beach Read!,"Cape Mayhem is a terrific read. The quirky characters, the detailed Cape May setting and the unexpected plot twists keep you well engrossed. A great gift for shore lovers."
5,guns and ammo magazine,if you like guns. like to shoot. want to know the newest ammo out there for home defense. this is a great magazine to get. it keeps you up to date. lots of great articles about guns and ammo. articles about the newest piston AR15 to the old flint locks. is a great read and lots of great information for the shooter
1,You'll be waiting,I ordered this magazine and another one on the same day just over a month ago. I already received two issues from my other magazine. I'm still waiting on my first copy of Guns and Ammo to read. Hopefully I'll get my first issue before the end of the year.
1,Still Waiting,I'm still waiting for my first issue to arrive. I am trying to reserve judgement. Guns and Ammo used to be a great magazine. Time will tell if it still has standards and good writing. All too often articles end up about the writer and not about the performance of the weapon.
4,Guns & Ammo Magazine,"It's a great magazine to keep updated on new products and gun news. Covers a broad range of different products, so it's not the same thing every month. The writing is alright, but not amazing. The one thing that bugs the hell out of me is how every article talks about how amazing each product is. I can't imagine every product being as amazing as the authors make it sound, you can obviously tell who's writing their paychecks (the major firearm manufacturers). If you want a more subjective review of guns and other products, you may want to look for another magazine provider. But don't worry, it's still entertaining"
3,Has not started yet so hard to rate,Has not started yet so hard to rate. So when I get it I can do this again. Nothing for now
1,STILL NO MAGAZINE,Where the F IS MY MAGAZINES? Been months now! DO I NEED TO GO TO BBB.org?!?!? THIS IS BS. CAN SOMEONE CLUE ME IN?
1,Bad Service,I haven't received it . Not very good service from you guys . probably won't make that mistake again .
1,What is taking so long?,It's been almost two months since ordering and paying for this magazine and have not seen the first issue. Great magazine but horrible service!
1,DID NOT ORDER IT!!!!!!,This is not a review. I cancelled this magazine because they never got the receipant's address right and kept sending it to me and I would have to resend it to my grandson. I will contact the magazine again and try to get them to cancel it. Any help you can give in this matter would be appreciated.
1,magazines not reccomended,ordered magazines from amazon in mid november. have recieved the two car mags. but have not recieved the gun mag. as of jan 6th. cannot get hold of anyone on amazon to complain. will stop using amazon. too much electronic gizmos are bad for your health.
5,"I'm Not Really A Gun Phreak, Honest","I enjoy reading this magazine even though I am not some right wing, government hating, racist radical."
3,Engineering Book,"Interesting book, covers alot of topics in the satellite realm. Unfortunately, you have to be an engineer to enjoy all the fine points, and mathematical equations. Not a bad book, but definitely not for the beginner. A good reference book, though."
5,Suena,"Great music for old salsa lovers. The best of the best. Salsa de la fina, salsa con cache, como Dacia el Ismael"
1,Wrong ones,"Bought these pads 2 months ago. Just got to the brake job over the weekend. Not even close to the right ones. Looks like I can't return them past 30 days. Moral to story, if you buy auto parts from Amazon, check them right away and make sure they are right."
5,AWESOME!!!,"Wish it wasn't just a mini series!!! Funny, smart, and addicting! If USA ever needs ideas for a show, definitely go back to Political Animals :)"
5,Great new show,This is a great new show! My husband and I both love it. We love discussing who the characters remind us of and what we think will happen next. So much fun! I hope it comes back next season!
5,I.Love.This.Show....,....about Hillary Clinton (my connection - I'm not in the know). It's a great series. I love the writing. I love the plot turns and I pray nightly for a continuation of the series.
1,Where is the talent?,"So disappointing....I assume A LOT OF Talented people were involved in creating this show.You are stuck....walk into a door....run until you drop....but, don't continue until youshow us more then 'bonking' and loose zippers. What happen to the original idea? You havelost the mojo. Hopefully you can pull it together."
1,Terrible Show,"This is one of the most disappointing pilots for a TV show that I have ever seen. I couldn't even get past the first 8 minutes. Who is that horrible man playing Sigourney Weaver's husband? He's terrible! She was awful in the role. If that was supposed to be Hillary Clinton.........what a joke. Not even close and not even remotely similar to Bill Clinton.Terrible, terrible show! I am requesting a refund ($1.99)."
3,New Political Show,"To me, this show is a parable of the Clintons political careers with a boring storyline. I'll be surprised if it makes a second season. Sigourney Weaver is outstanding, as always. The camera work does not make for great viewing, and, as I stated the storyline is weak."
4,worth seeing more than once,excellent dramagood for the political junkie or weaver fanneed to view in order to understandgood dramabest to view in order to get full contextgood for political junkies or s weaver fans-she is excellent in this series
5,Political Animals The Best!,I love this show. It has great acting and a very good plot line each week. I want to see it continue for a long time.
5,Perfection,"Stayed home sick from work today and came across this miniseries. Not much of a television watcher but this show seemed to represent a promising, and unfortunately rare, portrayal of a strong, intelligent, and successful female politician at the top ranks of government. In my hazy flu-addled state I thought I'd only be able to muster up enough energy to watch the first episode. Well, I was hooked after the first episode and watched all six today. I can't usually sit still to finish an episode of any TV show so this was amazing in itself. I thoroughly enjoyed the miniseries and heartily recommend it to anyone who enjoys a nuanced portrayal of politics and decision-making as well as of the people who are involved. I'd definitely give this series five thumbs up if I had five thumbs! :)"
2,Quaint,"This is a delightful relic from the past, with great ink-drawings. The info is good, but somehow not pertinent to modern readers who are seriously wanting to 1-up the world . I'd recommend Winning Thru Intimidation. Sorry, don't remember the author."
2,mmmmmm mmmmmm good!!!,"Pumpkin Seed Cheddar is the best of Dr. Kracker snackers, and all the varieties are excellent. While they are nutritious, they are also filling so that the urge to snack is satisfied much more quickly than other snack crackers. The sturdy structure allows plenty of peanut butter, cream cheese, or whatever your choice of spread, but they are also delicious by themselves."
2,where is the cheese?,"I read the reviews for this product and was excited. My family and I are trying to eat and snack healthy. This sounded like a perfect product. My son was the first to try them and asked me where is the cheese ? I tried them and I asked the same thing, where is the cheese flavor? They are very crunchy and have lots of pumpkin seeds, but no cheese flavor. They are not bad but disappointing if you are expecting cheese flavor."
5,Rana the Best,"Grupo Rana is one of the best groups in Central America. I love the way the sing and the way they're. I have never seen such a beautiful people like them. One of my favorite from grupo Rana is "" Erick"" I love him."
3,Father Said:Poems,"Judging by these poems Mr. Sirowitz did not have warm loving parents with a good marriage but some of the poems are amusing some of them make a good point. At the price that I paid which was minimal, those poems were probably worth the price of the book. I plan to pass the book on at the next library sale."
2,Very Poor Design for the money,It comes in two pieces with the magnet attached to the Back Plate:- and the Magnet dose NOT protrude far enough out to attach to a metal surface!- and the back plate does NOT attach very well to the front pocket!- so that when it falls to the floor it all falls apart.Summary: Poor Quality!
3,Stresses Jesus' Humanity and not Divinity,"The author claims we can solve today's problems by being compassionate and having faith like Jesus who preached about the kingdom here on earth. Unfortunately, the author barely acknowledges Jesus' divinity and indicates that Jesus was only concerned with preaching repentance to the Jews and if they refused, they would be destroyed (which happened with the destruction of the Temple in 70 C.E.). The book is mostly valuable in describing Jesus' time, i.e. the different groups of Jews, the poor and the oppressed, how time was observed, etc. To imitate Jesus is commendable but to deny a kingdom in heaven doesn't make sense."
1,AS EXPECTED,TYPICAL ORBIS PRESS NONSENSE! If any faithful Catholic has found a book by Orbis without nonsense let me know.
5,In Your Face Jesus,"I was so stunned to read the one-star review that I had to write. Above anything I have ever read, this book changed my life. It was a clarion call for we who say we are Christians to wake up and absorb the radically uncomfortable messages of the real Jesus, Jesus the Jew, the Jesus who existed before the apostles hit the road to create the belief systems and institutions that undergird Christianity. His profound messages speak of love for the dispossessed, the exploited, the forgotten, and challenge our rationalizations about why we deserve to enjoy such cushy lives without thinking twice about our impact elsewhere in the world. If you want to learn, and to grow deeply and broadly in your faith and in its expression in the world, read this book. But be warned: you may feel a strong pull to radically change your own life -- for the sake of others."
1,Sorry Excuse of a Book,I would not recommend this book for lining a bird cage. Sorry I supported this author by buying it. I found little value and could not recommend it. If it were possible to give a minus star review I would give this 5 negative stars.
1,Christian apologetics,"I bought this book because I am interested in the life of Jesus as a Jewish man, and leader of a Jewish movement. In the beginning, I thought this book would fulfill my interest, because Nolan does indeed depict Jesus as a man. However, there are many falsifiable statements about the Pharisees (Jesus himself was a Pharisee!), and by the end of the book, it became a defense of Christian philosophy, and a polemic about how Jesus is God, and no one could fail to see that. I was VERY disappointed, because Nolan took thoroughly Jewish Jesus and Christianized him, when he was never anything but an observant Jew. This is the falsehood of Christianity through the ages, and one of the reasons why Jesus remains unapproachable to Jews."
5,A real treasure,My love for Jesus was expanded and renewed by this book. My appreciation for Jesus of Nazareth who spent his life reaching out to the poor and the powerless inspires me to do the same. I have many favorite quotes from the text. Our book study was a great success and all of the 20 participants now consider this book a real treasure.
3,Good combination of some great performances,"Kisna would make the director Subhash Ghai proud. In this movie Ghai has created some remarkable characters. Vivek Oberoi as the lead man and both Isha Shravani and Anotonio Bernart as lead women have performed very well. Kisna is a movie in which morals have been combined with art to convey a message about the essence of the Indian trinity of karma (duty), dharma (religion) and prema (love).One place Kisna fails is that it gets repetitive in parts. The fight sequences drag and so does the endless number of times Kisna saves Catherine. That apart Kisna portrays art in many forms - in Isha Shravani's dances, in Anotonio Bernart's flawless performance, in A R Rahman's music, in Shiamak Davar's choreography. Each of these by itself is remarkable but Kisna is a movie in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. Overall, a good movie."
5,Excellent camera,"I had the chance to try this camera before I buy it and I have to say that it was a lot better than other 4 megapixels camera and its very small size is very convenient. It is powerful enough to take great pictures during the day, at night or indoors with poor light, the autofocus feature works perfectly for every situation and the AA betteries last long enough. What I like the most is the video feature, I took some and then played them with Windows Media Player and I was very impressed with its image and sound quality.Go for it! Great digital camera!"
4,Great small budget camera,"This is my second digital camera. I own Canon Powershot G2 and I am very happy with it but I was looking for a light, small camera to take it with me anywhere is the pocket or purse. Coolpix 4100 is a cheap, handy camera, very easy to use. You can take great shots with it. The only thing which may bother is the flash. It is not very strong so pictures taken with a bad light may be blurry. And everytime you take photo with a flash, you will need to wait few seconds before the flash recharges. However, for that amount of money, I think it is a great buy!"
2,Battery Trouble,"Within a couple of months of buying this product, it started giving trouble in respect of sensing the battery. A couple of shots after inserting a set of brand new batteries, the camera starts indicating that the battery is exhausted/low and one cannot shoot any more photos (or do anything else). The problem is intermittent - it works sometimes. It has been a really frustrating experience and I am still trying to sort this out."
2,stay away from this camera,"I used to have an Olympus Camedia 4100, and decided to switch to a smaller camera with the same resolution. The performance of this Nikon is really disappointing. In auto-focus mode, photos mostly turn out blurry (which never happened with my old Olympus). The camera does offer different settings for different types of shots (portrait, indoor, outdoor, sunset etc.), but only portrait generally produces crispness comparable to what I am used to."
4,Easy to use camera with pleasant results,"The 4100 is an easy to use camera with several nice features that deliver better than expected results. It is perfect for vacations and parties, and most other personal uses. This is not a camera for photo enthusiast requiring lots of options and lots of zoom capability. Overall, it is a great bargain.Pros:- Priced a significant amount lower than competing models- Very easy to use and intuitive menus- Great picture quality (not excellent)- Compact and solid, but not at the expense of usability- Usefull scene and picture framing toolsCons:- The batteries won't last more than twenty five pics w/flash- The LCD display is not so great in sunlight- The 3x optical zoom is only good enough for close objects and portrait shots (this is why it is not 5 stars)- The digital zoom seriously sacrifices image quality"
2,Not so good camera if you have young children,"I have this camera for 4 months now. Generally, it takes good pictures. However, if you have young children and intend to take a lot of inside photos, where the flash is used, I would not recommend this camera for the following reasons: (1) the shutter delay is very noticable (after you press the button and by the time the picture is captured, the kid has moved out of the picture), (2) when the flash is used, this camera take a long time to recharge the flash and until the flash is recharged you cannot take another picture (the delay is roughly 10 seconds for an inside shot -- for me). Anyway, I was so fustrated by having a lot of shots of my kid's head and missing a few pictures waiting for the flash to recycle, I broke down and got a Kodak. But I will still keep this camera as a backup because it is fairly compact and does OK for taking outside pictures."
1,When will the zoom motor stop working?,Why don't you go ahead and buy this just for the thrill of guessing when the zoom motor will stop working. Took just over a year for me (lots of people reported the same). Sending in for repair will come in at the price of buying a new camera - which will be a non-Nikon for me.
3,A lot of pictures and mistakes.,It is a good book. It has a lot of pictures and also too many wrong information. It's a shame. David Donald haven't made a final revision.
4,"It's ""Okay"" but a Little Too Highfalutin'","This would be a really nice sign if it weren't so jazzy. i mean look, it's got two other languages besides english and all them fancy zig-zags. Not to mention it's in bright YELLOW---nearly went blind looking at it! Tone it down next time fellas."
3,"""Living life as a teenager""","While reading this book I couldn't help wondering what happen to the ""Hippie's"",""Jock's"",""Greaser's"" that I went to High School with. This book was a walk through memory lane. This book took place in the city but it could of been anywhere. The feelings that the characters had were alot like my own. The tests,homework,hormones,drugs,violence,fun,failure,dating,fear, growing pains,ect...All of these experiences made us who we are today. A fun and easy book to read on a rainy afternoon in Fla."
4,Tropical delight,"If you're fond of lightweight, comedic detective shows set in tropical climes (think Magnum or VIP or the uber-kitschy Acapulco HEAT), you'll like this one. The transfers are a bit pixelated, but who cares? (At 8 shows per disk, that's hardly surprising.) My wife and I particularly love watching it in winter, when the fictional Key Mariah looks like a little bit of heaven. As someone else observes, there are no mountains in the Florida Keys, but that just adds to the show's cheesy charm. (It was shot, I believe, in a different location each season--Mexico, Israel (!), and South Africa.)"
5,"Thin plots, no emmy nods, but...","I used to watch this show in the early 90s when it was part of Crime Time after Prime Time. I love the laid-back style, scenery and architecture. (It was filmed in Mexico, not the Keys.) It strongly influenced my decorating style (palm tree paintings, beautiful colors, wooden shutters, and white stucco.)If nothing else, ""Nick Slaughter"" in a wife-beater or an open shirt is worth the purchase price, and there is plenty of scenery for the men, as well. It's a light-hearted escape that will leave you feeling like you've spent a few hours in an adirondack chair on the beach, umbrella drink in hand. I highly recommend it!"
3,Tropical Heat But not Florida Keys,"Okay so I own the series and yes it is light entertainment with attractive characters BUT having spent plenty of time in the Florida Keys I have always found it disconcerting when they keep telling us it's Florida WHERE, INCIDENTALLY , WE DO NOT HAVE MOUNTAINS etc..notice those shots across the ""ocean"" with the scenic view of things that just aren't Florida. For fun and it is worth the price.."
5,This books makes you do the work!!!...,"Alot of people will not understand this book because their minds are not used to working on problems in the manner of imagining ""what might be"", and ""what if"" scenarios that that compel you to think in different dimensions. It feels very strange to think in different dimensions. These exercises take alot of mental persistance and practice to get over the initial feelings of strangeness that accompany the skills and powers that these exercises convey!!!"
1,Odd religous overtones,"I picked up the book thinking it might give me some practical advice. Which it did: buy what you look good in not what's trendy, hunt for bargains, etc. Nothing earthshattering but okay advice. What I found bizarre and offensive however was the frequent references to God and Christianity. It was not billed as a ""Christian's Guide to Shopping"" yet it had passages that instructed women to ""cover their bosoms"" ""as Christians"" need to be modest. Is this necessary? I found it offensive and off putting."
2,"How to save $$$ while having a large family and living the ""righteous"" life.","I mistakenly got this book from the library because I was interested in another book with a similar title. I must say I was taken aback by the religious mentions on almost every page. This book showed a frugal way to shop through thrift stores, garage sales, etc. That is not a bad thing but the presentation was all wrong. There was one part describing a mother and 10-year old girl shopping for shoes that just depressed me. It was so bent on finding the ""sensible"" shoes that the enjoyment of finding a great deal was sucked out. In another part of the book some woman was chastised for working part time when the ""mending"" was piling up. That silly little job cost her more money in the long run because she just wasn't doing the ""right"" thing as a mother and wife. That was it for me. What a waste of paper."
2,Its not as good as her aerobic vidoes,"I love the Carribean workout series, but this dvd was only okay. it really didnt give me that great of a workout, but I am not a big pilates person to begin with. This just seemed slow and unchallenging"
1,very disappointed,I thought buying a item with a well known name as this would be great. I would have hoped the price would even out my possible satisfaction for this product. Also I loved the pink. When I opened the box the plates on the flat iron were hanging off. I tried to snap them into place but they would not stay. For the amount of money I payed i expected a much better product. Needless to say i returned it the next day.
3,Maybe mine was defective...,"THe wrap itself is actually durable, but the area to insert the iphone is not well made at all. The little slit ripped as soon as I put the phone in. Worse than that, the sides where the see-thru plastic meets the silicone gel wrap is glued. The phone actually touches the glue and the glue stays on the phone. I was less than pleased upon seeing that. The glue has a tough time coming off as well. Maybe mine was defective, but I don't know. Still it's the best for the money."
1,Only Two Movements of Rachmaninoff,"Beware! The recording of the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3 includes only the first two movements, with the second broken up onto two tracks and mislabeled."
2,Flawed recording of Rachmaninoff,"The publisher of the CD failed to provide the third movement of the Rachmaninoff 3rd piano concerto. The disc cover shows movements 2 and 3 but it really is the second movement split between two bands. However, the first 2 movments are likely the best recording of Rach3 one can find. Also, the Chopin is surperb."
2,"Good Product, Bad Support","My Coby CX-266 works well on MP3 files read from either a SD/MMC card or a Flash Drive. It seems that so long as the MP3 file is around 3MB the Coby can handle it. However, if the file gets much larger that 3MB, the Coby won't play it.Of course I called the Coby helpline. Neither of the two people seemed to know what a Coby CX-266 was. They were absolutely no help. They couldn't even refer me to a more technical person. Next I tried email. As you might expect, I have received no response from two emails.Here's my recommendation: If your Coby works well out of the box - you're fortunate. If you need Coby support for your product - you're sunk. I suggest that you wait for some other manufacturer to start selling a MP3 compatible radio"
4,Good as long as you know what you want,"I like this product, but I could see where some people would not.The good: It sounds great in my opinion. It plays radio and MP3. The MP3 can be from USB stick or SD Card. It seems amazingly hard to find a desktop MP3 clock/radio a reasonable price if you don't want to have to plug in an iPod to some strange dock.The bad: It's ugly. Looking at the picture I didn't think it would be ugly, but it is. Mostly because of the size. If it looked like this at half the size it would be ""sleek"" or ""elegant"", but at this size it is just ""clunky."" The places for the SD card or USB Stick are on the front. This means that they can easily be broken off if you were to bang on it trying to ""snooze"". In my case, I bought this for my 2 year old to go to sleep with at night and he could easily pull the SD card out and drop it down a heat duct. Last, most functions are only available through the remote which is always a headache."
4,They work for me.,"This is the 3rd pair of Valeo Ocelot weight lifting gloves that I've owned. They're the most comfortable ones I've tried, and obvious from the repeat purchases, I think they're great. The reason I gave them 4 rather than 5 stars is because the 2nd pair lasted only a few months before literally coming apart at the seams. The first pair lasted a few years and the ones I have now seem to be holding up well.Be aware though: when you wash them, their color leaks. Either hand wash them or wash them alone."
5,Believe what you read- these gloves are a must buy.,"I purchased these only after reading the feedback that had been left. I am so glad I did. They are everything and more than described. They are soft but they grip the bar so well, it's an amazing feeling. Their soft, no breaking in period. The color looks bright orange but they aren't. More of a beige/orange that (almost) blends with your skin. They do not scream out orange at all. The fingers are long preventing calousing on the middle joint area of our fingers. This glove is a winner, trust everyone who is raving about them, you'll be very happy you did."
5,Excellent!!!,"Gloves are soft and thin, but super protective! Didn't think the color was that bad. Buy these, you will love them."
4,Great Gloves,These gloves have great padding and great quality. I have small hands and ordered medium and they run tight. Should be ok after broken in. Fingers are 3/4 though and that could be bad or good depending on what you are looking for. It does restrict your finger movement some. I definitely would reorder when these wear out.
5,THIS SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO READ,"After reading this book I was hooked. IT is like twilight but in a catholic/Christian form. When i picked up this book in a Christian book store i thought ""o great another religious novel"" , but once i got started i couldn't put it doawn."
4,Wonderful examples of leading spiritual lives today,This book demonstrates what every Christian parent would like for their children. It does a great job of demonstrating how damaging living only for worldly pleasure can be and how rewarding living a fully engaged life can be. The only weakness I perceived was that most every character seems so fully aware of themselves. But the interactions of these characters were very open and transparent. It is how we all would be if we were fully self aware and fully in touch with our feelings.
2,Historical narrative of African ecosystem,"McCann, a historian by education, provides us with a synthesis of the changing African landscape. He argues that the landscape in Africa has always been unstable, and the cause for the instability is anthropogenic activity. His argument specifically deals with the forests of Africa, and he addresses the issue of 'perceived' deforestation. Essentially, he seeks to prove that whatever deforestation that is occurring now in Africa is simply part of a larger, human-induced cycle. This implies that deforestation is ""okay"" in Africa, because it has happened before and recovered before. However, his argument falls short when he employs the same methodology (researching historical narratives) to prove his points as he does to DISprove the points of others. It is clear that history is not the most accurate of teachers, and I had a difficult time believing McCann's selected historical essays had any more credence than those he attempted to detract."
3,cecilio gold lacquer brass finish trumpet,"i received the trumpet in good condition looks very nice, but the valves keep sticking no matter how often i clean them and lube them. my son has missed many music classes because of this problem. i guess they are right when they say,,""you get what you pay for"""
3,Good for beginners,For about a $100 it is a good starter trumpet with great sound but it is poor quality. After 2 months the valves started sticking and some orange color leaked out with valve oil which stained clothing. Get better quality if you know they will keep it up for few years.
4,Great mini detox ideas for your mind body & soul,"I've tried one of the mini detox weekends and it was amazing! I had been having a little too much fun and overindulging in food, alcohol and a lot of late nights leaving me feeling bloated, run down, and with zero energy. I thought this would be a great kickstart into a healthier me. Even though the detox is only over a weekend the mono-diet and complementary at home treatments really hit me hard (I was very toxic). By Monday I felt rejuvenated, fresh and it felt like it had given my digestive system a new kickstart. It would be great to give your body a boost every now and then.I can't wait to try the other detox plans including ones for the change of season, your spirtual side etc.. they all seem really logical and easy to do. I really recommend this for busy people or anyone wanting a boost to their health."
5,"Great gift , great resource","This book covers a lot of information that we cover in the food and nutrition classes that I teach. For my students, it's an invaluable resource with information I can trust It's balanced, accurate, and easy for students -- or anyone -- to understand. It's also become my standard gift for friends, weddings, and more."
2,For dietetics students...too simple,"I had to buy this book for a class, but only used it once. It doesn't really contain THAT much information, and when one has to do research, this in not the best book to use as a reference. If you're not a student, I'd say it'll be very helpful, but for students...it is just too simple and doesn't get into the complicated facts about nutrition or dietetics we really need to learn. I already graduated, and I won't recommend this book as the reference for a major course in dietetics."
1,The Completely Useless Food and Nutrition Guide,The information is so basic as to be useless. It is material you might have learned in middle school. It is not even a good reference.
3,Was expecting something more professional,"This book is dumbed down for the person that knows nothing about nutrition and has a short attention span. It reads more like a women's magazine than a reference book (and that is an insult to women's magazines, not women who can do better than this). I probably won't even bother to keep it."
3,still using the USDA Food Guide Pyramid?,"I was disappointed to see that this book still endorses the USDA Food Guide Pyramid. Walter Willett's Book, ""Eat, Drink, and be Healthy"" has a much more acurate and up-to-date pyramid that emphasizes the importance of unsaturated oils, nuts, legumes, whole grains, and fish, and he doesn't get paid by beef and dairy lobbyists who pay our government to spread the false fact that it is necessary to eat these products to be healthy."
1,Product defective,"I was able to get the computer up and running, but the CD-DVD drive was defective and I had to return the computer to Amazon."
1,Not jazz at all.,"I've heard better jazz from Montevani and Gordon Jenkins. In fact, this isn't jazz at all. It's commercial, uninteresting pap, good at best for creating pleasant background noise during a cocktail party. I see that someone wants more than $50 for the album. I tossed my copy."
2,PJ's struggle with 3rd output,"The Phunk Junkeez have always been known for great music, and very energetic shows. I have seen them several times and they are still a great band, but this album was a big disappointment. The PJ's hard to find self titled debut is nothing short of a masterpiece, if a copy is ever available, snatch it up! This album fails to bring any notable songs, as it is a bit slower with an obvious void left by K-Tel. The one bright spot is the short but sweet song ""Deadbeat""."
4,Phunk Junkeez: Tearin' up a Wack Planet!,"I had tha oportunity ta see these guys live in Columbus OH with ICP and Tha Kottonmouth Kings and ta say tha least...these guys were tha s***! I had ta get tha cd and it bumps! It goes beyond Injected, an ealier yet still cool title from this...this is definetly a must-have title."
1,This album was very disappointing,"After hearing the PJ's first 2 albums, Fear of a Wack Planet is a major disappointment. They're obviously lacking after losing 2nd rapper K-Tel Disco. Soulman makes a good effort alone, but the albums lyrics aren't half as good as they could be. The band also seems to have lost a lot of their ""phunkyness."" The PJ's best days are behind them, stick with the first 2 albums."
4,Very Good Music,"I really think that this band can go somewhere. Their Rap/Rock mix is sure to please many fans, but it isn't quite as good as it could be. Other then ""Million Rappers"" and ""Phunky Phunky (I am a Junky)"" there weren't any awesome songs. The other songs were solid, and some of them were quite good. I say buy this CD only if you want a Rock/Rap mix in the same songs."
5,My girlfriend thinks I like these pants more than her ...,"That's not possible, but it's close. I have two pairs of these and I LOVE them. I guarantee you'll never have a more comfortable night's rest."
5,Classic Satin Sleep Pants,I bought these to wear on my honeymoon in Vegas. They were so comfortable and my new bride just loved them. They wear well and don't bunch up or get wrinkled easily.They are so light weight and easily removable. They wash well and are still comfortable.
4,Not bad for the price,"Very comfortable, silky and sexy. The only issue I have is that it runs a bit small. I may buy more and get the matching top/robe too."
5,Great Buy,"These pants were a great buy. I chose the blue, and the color was a wonderful royale blue. The pants are very comfortable as well."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this for my better half, expecting a Satin-like textured pants, but what I received was completely different. It is very shiny, but it feels like plastic. I found this to be strange because the robe and shirt were very nice. Although it is funny to the touch...sadly, this will be returned."
1,Not as ordered,"I ordered this for my husband last year and they sent a matching shirt instead, never got the pants even after calls to customer service. Quality appears to be okay for the price, although it's never been washed or worn."
5,Nice!,"This is the first pair of sleeping pants I've bought like this, but they are very nice. Not quite silk, but almost! I would recommend them."
1,intimo satin sleep pant,"The garment I received was labeled large. In fact, at best it is a ""small"". The material and workmanship was good but the product was simply mislabeled."
3,try the silk instead,"I bought this pair of satin sleep pants and another pair of silk sleep pants by the same manufacturer. Although both were fine, the silk is superior in comfort and worth the difference in price."
3,Heavily Dyed,"We ordered the black pants, and the fit was good but they had to be washed four times because they bled into the sheets while he slept. Now I have one set of grey sheets to all my white sheets. They are not as soft as my normal satin, and they really had a smell to them even after a few washings. Just make sure you wash them several times before ruining a set of good sheets."
4,Nice Feel,"Wearing for the first time tonight. Feel a little tight around my upper thighs sitting down, but are pretty good walking around. I have thick thighs so can't wear regular cut slacks. Ordered large and am surprised that the inseam seems only 30 inches. I am 5'11"" and the fit is fine for me but not for someone over 6 foot tall. If you are kind of bulky go for the larger size (x-large). If you are smaller body type these will work fine, maybe even a little roomy for you."
3,snug,these pants are nice but could be irregular. if you are buying these for a tall man it might be slightly high water
1,NOT AS DESCRIBED,The title says these are satin. They are more like stiff polyester. They are not soft and silky. Even after washing them they are still stiff. Very disappointed and wish I could get my money back!
1,cheesy fabric,"Didn't like the fabric, was hoping for shiny satin. Also, large size was much too short for my 6'3"" hubby."
2,Not What I Expected,"I bought a pair of satin pj pants in a store for my hubby and he loves them but now I can't find any in stores so I ordered a pair of these. Normally my husband who is 6'3"" wears a size large pj pants. So that is what I ordered. The pair that came is not only much poorer quality than the one I got in the store for about the same price but they are tiny! They are very short and the waist size would barely fit me (I am 5'3"" and about 140#)!! I was very diappointed and might try to return them."
4,great product,"got this screen back in february, for $900 I've been a proud owner since then. My main fit with this unit are the following: LCD could be more bright it's very difficult to watch a movie with sunlight on it, and I would have enjoyed DivX playback, nicer graphics and user customizable backgrounds the ones that come with it just bite. Aside from that a great buy, I love the dual zone technology on this you could be listening to something on the front and have your passengers on the back listening something totally different."
4,"Good if you have a horse, but...","I was trying to find a step that would help me be able to get into our family van, without the expense of a specially mounted metal one. I stepped up on this, and felt like if i put this out beside the van i could almost be over the roof! ^_^ So still looking for a proper step for me.but its very nice, and, as someone who did ride many years ago, this is light enough to move around to wherever necessary, but not so light the horse could easily bump it out of position"
3,Binding Fell Apart,"Great art, good story, although I wish there were more of it in this collection. My main gripe is with the actual workmanship of the book. The cover and outer pages separated from the inner pages upon my reading it. The inner pages are still stuck together (fortunately), but they are just floating between the covers.I have kept the book in an air conditioned room since purchasing it. I did not spread the pages out or otherwise abuse the book. I carefully flipped through, spreading the pages maybe 60 degrees apart, holding the thing in my hands so as not to stretch it. I am pretty disappointed that it would fall apart even when I was so careful."
2,"Great Art, Story is Melodramatic, Childish [and] Bombastic.","This is an interesting book, but it's too sparely written to have real substance. It's like seeing the idealized visuals to a dramatic future-war Wagner opera - There's a lot of imagination and interesting design involved and you can kind of imagine the music, but without more character depth this just didn't ring True or Great to me.If you're under 20 then this kind of thing has a certain magnetism, but adult comic-connoisseurs.. don't get too enthused about all the brilliant reviews here. If it was really that good you would have heard about it already."
5,An EXCELLENT Product,"My hardwood floors are nearly 70 years old. Refinishing them is both cost-prohibitive and impractical. I bought one can of Bruce and then ordered two more. The floors look very much like they have been re-sealed and buffed. The only other things that you need are a good, thick applicator and a friend to help you move the furniture. I'm so happy with this product that I'm about to order two more cans to wax the rest of the floors."
4,A 3.5 star piece.,"This is a nice accent lamp to put on a mantle or in a corner where there might be a lack of light. It's a little smaller then I thought it would be, but once lit it looks good. Adds light to my maritime themed living room."
4,"Dries fast, holds tight","Krazy Glue is excellent on plastic. I usually use it to repair my daughter's toys. The other day, I used it to repair the plastic latch on my medicine cabinet that had fallen off. Once this glue dried, the latch held strongly enough to be completely usable once again.Krazy Glue dries quickly and holds tight. I usually hold it in place for 30 seconds and then leave it to cure overnight. Be careful with the hands. I sometimes get it on my skin and it is tough to remove. In fact, I can't remove it by washing. I just have to tough it out until it wears off. A solvent might do the trick, but I haven't tried that.I find the precision tip isn't so precise for me. I tend to get a little too much everywhere. It also clogs every time I use it. I need to use a little needle to unclog the tip before using. The glue, however, is wonderful.Great product. I always have it around for emergencies."
5,An award-winning saga inspired by a true story,"An award-winning saga inspired by a true story, When I Find the Ocean is a movie about a young girl coming to terms with the loss of her father. The ocean claimed the life of Lily Strickland's father; lacking a way to say goodbye, she leaves her grandparents and mother to confront her own fears amid the challenges of the wilderness. A deeply emotional, family-friendly movie unfolds, shot against breathtaking seacoast, river, and forest natural scenery. Highly recommended. PG, 104 min., closed captioned (but not subtitled)."
5,GREAT MOVIE!,"I loved this movie. Anything with Lee Majors is family friendly. It is sad that the little girl was so abused, but until we outlaw hitting kids, people will overdo this stupid, senseless manner of child-rearing. I love when, ""Grandpa,"" Lee Majors decked the abuser.My twelve year-grandson and I watched this together. He was mesmerized by every second of it.A lot of very important issues were raised here-Thank you to the producer and actors!My cousin was dreadfully abused by her real father and we had no idea. He beat her because he did not like her boyfriend.We often have no idea what goes on in ""respectable"" families."
2,When I Find the Ocean,"This movie has some famous actors in it yet the director (tonya holly) apparently could not get them to make this a really good film. The star Lilly, really would she not at least put up a fight to keep from getting beat by her mother's fiance? How could her mother, grandmother or grandfather not know she was being physically abused by their former daughter-in-law fiance? If you are going to get into civil rights of the 60s,at least do it some justice! I was not impressed with this movie and I live in Alabama."
4,"Originally, it was overpriced","I've tasted some of this extravagantly rich dark chocolate, 70% cocoa. And it is most delicious, no question about it.But call it artisan chocolate, or whatever you like, I would not have spent $12 for a 2.2 ounce chocolate bar, including the shipping --- as Amazon had originally priced it --- chocoholic though I am. At that cost, even I would consider it too ""rich."" I have tasted equally fine master work chocolate for less, and no --- for ultimate chocolate connoisseurs --- not of the drug store Hershey or Cadbury varieties.Maybe subsequent to April 13, 2008, Amazon lowered its price. I would not know. But as of April 17, 2010, the price was moot in any case --- since Amazon no longer offered the product. If it were revived at $8 something per bar, well, okay."
4,Delightful Story,"I enjoy this book for the reason that it is simple and fun. Kid's have a natural connection with animals and Martha is a lovable family dog that has a special gift that helps her communicate with her family. I recently purchased it for a few friends who have toddlers. They all love it.I understand this book is part of a series. I have not read the others, but do recommend this one highly for toddlers and young readers."
4,Gorgeous book,"If you are looking for a coffee table book with gorgeous pictures, this is definitely a wonderful book. If you are looking for a book, as I was, that would show you photos of complete gardens so that you might create your own French-inspired garden, this is not the best choice. However, it is a delightful addition to any garden library. If you have been lucky enought to visit France, it brings back fond memories of the landscape. Enjoy!"
1,Never received!!! Hate the service!,It is very difficult to review a product or in this case a publication that has never arrived.Little help!!Where is it? And when can we accept it to arrive?Linda Drake
3,Too may paid online artciles even for fully subscribed user,"I have been a subscription member of HBR for over 2 years now and am a fully subscribed member (Online + Print). The quality of articles and case studies are excellent and definitely worth the reading time. I try not to miss any article in the print issue.However, on the online front they can do better. For a fully subscribed user, it is a struggle that each time I do a search for any topic, I get a list 80-85 % online articles which I need to ""Buy PDF"" and just 15 -20 % articles which I can read online. Then why do they charge separate fee for an online subscription in fully paid membership? When I am in travel, I don't want to pull ou my credit card each time to a read an article on a topic of my choice."
2,Treat your current customers better!,"I was about to renew my subscription when I noticed they want to charge me $159 as a returning customer vs $129 for new customers. What a great way to promote loyalty...make your current customers pay more!HBR - you've got a great magazine, but you've got to start treating your customers right."
2,One great article per issue,"My husband had heard such great things about this magazine, so I gave it to him for Christmas last year. I just asked him if he would like me to renew it. He said that, unfortunately, it only has one great article per issue in it. The rest is no different from any other magazine, and that one article is not worth it to him for us to pay so much for the subscription."
5,HBR,"Bar none, the best business magazine on the planet. Not ever an easy read, but always full of valuable insights and ideas. Well worth the price tag IMO."
3,PLEASE BECOME AVAIL ON KINDLE!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this magazine and it's important to my career but I really want to receive it via my new kindle! Please consider this alternate media those of us who are reading our Wall Street Journals in transit. I need to bookmark and follow-up on the info in the magazine, hard copy is not as savvy as your readers."
5,An incredible book -- highly recommended!,"You do not have to see a therapist to benefit from this book! This is the best book I have ever read about addiction. I found it to be different from every other book I've ever seen about this topic, and it has been enormously helpful to me, which I have to say was a big surprise given my experience with other books. The author is thoughtful, fair-minded, and compassionate, and the case histories are wonderful. This book really is in a class by itself, because it talks about the emotional basis of addictions in a way that I haven't seen anywhere else. If you are involved with 12-step programs, I personally think this book is perfectly compatible with them. But whether you have been in 12-step programs or not, this is a must-read book. I highly recommend it to anyone with addictive or compulsive behavior."
3,grill cover,"Although this item fit very well, it did not hold up well in the elements. After only one summer, it developed tears in the fabric."
2,Cheap ass grill cover,"I have to replace my grill cover every year, sometimes sooner. It has made my grill last for 5 yrs without much rust and I use my grill all the time! The problem is at approx. $25 a pop, I could have bought another grill."
1,Please don't buy this cover,"I purchased this cover from lowes 2 yrs ago for around 40 bucks. It lasted 1 yr, i used it over the winter and when the season changed and it got warm out. It was dry rooted and tearing at the seems, there was a bee hive under the cover, they got in from where the cover had torn. It looks good when brand new, but it has no long gevity at all."
2,Does not hold up well in cold,"We purchased this grill cover with our grill last summer. It is attactive and fits our Charbroil smoker grill with smoker box very well. However, it faded considerably more than expected with the summer sun and it has not held up well in the cold weather. The material is very brittle and cracked and split when we took the cover off to grill on a 40 degree day. I'm now searching for another cover to fit our grill and will not purchase this one again."
1,Not durable,"I agree with everyone else: this cover isn't durable at all. It lasted 6 months for me in relatively mild weather before it got a massive tear. I boughtMr. Bar-B-Q Platinum Prestige Large Grill Coveras a replacement, and while it doesn't fit as snugly, it works fine with a bungee cord securing it and is worlds more durable."
1,Waste of money,"Considering how much I love my Char Griller, you'd think they'd make a cover to match the quality of the grill. I used this for less than 3 months in the California sun, and then it promptly tore along one of the seams. What a waste of money."
3,Perfect Fit; Need to Replace Annually,"Our Char Griller lives in Puerto Vallarta where the summers are hot and the sea air can rust and age most materials. We found our cover in shreds after one season. Still, I just re-ordered TWO of them. At this price, we consider it a 'disposable' but necessary item. The fit is perfect. We had no trouble with the seams. We wish they would make the cover out of a sturdy, reinforced fabric (like Weber does)."
1,Buy a Tarp and bungee cords instead,"This cover is a piece of garbage, but then again, I should have expected no less for $25.00. However, the grill (Model 2121) is great (except for the cheap Chinese made plastic wheels). Everything the previous posters have posted is ""Spot-On"". The only benefit this cover provides is, it keeps the dust off and will last if you keep your grille stored in the garage or some other ""Covered"" area. Forget about keeping it outside for extended periods of time because the elements (UV rays etc) will rot this thing out in a heartbeat. I live in the ""Peoples Democratic Republic of Kalifornia"" and even here the results are the same as they are in Texas. Soooo..save your money, throw a tarp over it instead or if you just gotta have a ""real"" grill cover, find one that resists UV Rays and be prepared to pay more. Remember, you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, in this case, you get less. T-R-A-S-H."
1,Not worth it!,"This cover is a waste of money. We live in the mid-Atlantic states and our weather is not that severe. The cover had a tear in it the first season we had it. The fading was pretty bad but that didn't bother us as much as the decomposition that occurred. By the time we decided to trash it, it literally came apart in my husband's hands when he took/tore it off the grill. We will be replacing it with a better one."
2,Not a cover for the Elements,"I bought this cover to replace the horrible cover I purchased last winter. The product description said it was vinyl, which would be better than the cloth covered vinyl cover I was trying to replace. When it arrived I was disappointed to see it was the exact same cover! Hubby bought the first cover, so I didn't know I was purchasing same item.I'm going to spray it with UV protectant, but I'm afraid it won't hold up. Last time it went from BLACK to light gray in less than a month on our morning sun exposure deck. This cover was not designed for the elements as sun and cold make it brittle and it rips so easily after a few months. Looking at it straight from the package you would think it would hold up as it feels heavy duty.I gave it the second star for its custom fit. That is the only thing it has going for it."
2,Cannot take the Texas weather,"The cover starts out great. Fits nicely, and looks nicely, however it cannot stand up to the Texas weather.The grill has been sitting out on an uncovered deck. About 6 months after purchase, the sun caused the cover to horribly fade and get brittle. Now the cover is all torn up because every time you take it off the grill, another part rips. I still plan on buying another one just to see how it holds up now that I've built a roof over the deck."
1,Junk,"I have ordered this cover before from the company and it lasted quite a while. This cover is ripping already and is faded. I don't know if they changed manufacturers or what, but not worth it."
2,Disappointed!,Cover was way to large for our Char Griller. It is cheaply made and is cheap material. Very disappointed in this Char Griller product!
3,CharGriller Cover,"Very inexpensive but also not very sturdy. I would have expected it to last longer than two years but at the price, I did buy another."
2,Find a better cover,The only thing that is great about this item is the smokestack cover and the velcro on the one end. It isn't heavy enough and tears easily.
1,"Horrible Cover, Good Grill.. .","Don't buy this cover! You'd think CharGriller is primarily in the cover and re-placement parts selling business.. . If you build a good/solid grill (why do you need a huge line of replacement parts.. .) The cover is worthless (big rips, and discoloration after 1 year). Not worth $5.Still a good grill (tub design with a smokestack), however it's innerworkings, and outside parts/racks etc. needs major updating.CharGriller listen up! Perfect Flame makes a better grill, with nicer components (and a waaaay better cover)!"
1,Perfect til it has to actually fight the elements,"I thought the quick tears were because the cover had to endure a Minnesota winter. That is what I thought until the 2nd one did not even make it beyond fall before getting ridiculous tears. I considered removing the shelves as part of the ""winterizing"" so the number of corners would be minimized, but the first major tear in the 2nd cover was from the chimney stack.I would consider continuous replacement if the cover cost less than $10...I mean, in all honestly those cheap blue tarp you buy to cover the stuff on top of your station wagon during a cross country trip fared better than this thing.But at over $25 + S/H this is not just a bad deal but a shameless ripoff. What a shame, the grill is so good. The cover is just land-fill filler."
1,read the reviews FIRST,I needed a cover and ordered it. I read the reviews AFTER I orderd it and tried to cancel the order quickly to no avail. I returned it unopened as no one was happy with the quality and I would rather lose the postage than the cost of the cover.I gave it one star only because I had to to submit the review.
1,"help, please","I received this grill for Christmas, pretty much based on customer reviews. Now, my husband will not let me move it out of the house until we get a cover for it.I read the reviews for the cover and don't really want to spend the $$$ for this one, that apparently no one likes. Can anyone suggest a different brand??? I am really tired of the grill in the house, can't really use it there!"
1,Won't last a season,"The vast majority of the other reviewers here are correct -- you're better off doing something else to cover the Char Griller. This cover is of extremely poor quality. The reality is that it is very prone to tearing and weather wear over just one season, and won't last.Having read the prior reviews, I even sprayed the thing down with heavy-duty Scotchguard in an effort to help before I first used it. Alas, that didn't help. Get a higher-quality fitting cover."
1,Cover ripped after 3 months,I wish I had read the other reviews before buying. I don't think the manufacturer put any UV inhibitors in the cover. I just finished duct taping the newest tears. We live in sunny California so too much rain or hard winters are not the problem. We rarely used the barbeque and so just sitting out in the sun destroyed the cover.
1,"Tears easily, and is not heat proof","Like many other reviewers, I too have had nothing but problems with my cover. The first year I used it, the cover started to tear. It now is a very loose deterrent to inclement weather, with the rust on my smoker being the condemning evidence. Also, the cover is made out of nylon or some other plastic like fabric, requiring the smoker to be absolutely cold before covering. This is horrible for damper climates like Pittsburgh. The burn-through on the fire box, (I'll write a review for that, too), poor construction of the cover, and the lack of an asbestos-like material have resulted in a rapidly aging smoker."
1,Why is garbage sold,As previously reviewed this cover is a piece of garbage.Better save you money and put it towards a new grill.
1,AVOID THIS,"Bought the 5555 cover for the 1224 grill in June. By September the sides exposed to the sun had turned from black to light gray. Tears started forming and quickly spread. Basically this cover is now useless to me in only 4 months. When I e-mailed the company, they would not replace this unless I could provide a receipt. I didn't buy this online, and I don't keep every receipt. Guess they don't value me as a customer, or the bad word of mouth this kind of customer service represents.On the other hand, I'm very happy with the grill itself. I wonder if I can find a better cover from some other company...."
1,Horrible,"First of all, I bought this expecting it to be a filmed interview. That was my fault. But what I didn't realize was that it is not authentic, probably made by some foreign country who knows nothing about the chili peppers, just to rip us off. (Even if I only payed $5.) The picture on the cover isn't even from a photoshoot, it looks like its from an award show or something, they're not even looking at the camera! Also, on the description on the back of the case there are so many grammitcal errors it couldnt possibly have been made, or passed by the Chili Peppers. Obviously made by an idiot. I don't even know if I'd consider this Chili Pepper's memorabilia for those reasons. So, if you are planning on wasting your good money on an unauthentic piece of crap, go ahead. But you could easily put that good money towards some real Chili Peppers stuff. I would recommend Funky Monks or Off the Map."
4,A very good and basic guide to US law,"I agree with many reviewers, this is a very good book to get the basics down on our US law system but it seems like when the author is finished with facts he sprinkles in his slightly liberal opinions. It didn't bother me too much but I would have wished he would have stuck to facts and not felt to need to add cute comments to his chapters. Oh well, it's his book but that was the only complaint I had. Otherwise his law explanations are spot on and quite useful for the beginning/intermediate student."
5,"Intro law book, a great read",Needed this for class and is well written and easy to relate to the real world. A great buy for any one interested in basic principles and hisotry of law in America.
4,A nice introduction,"I am a lawyer working in Australia. I am planning to do more law study in the US later this year, and read this book on the recommendation of a professor. While a section of the book after the introduction is a little straight-forward and essentially like revision for someone familiar with the common law, the book then moves into a very accessible and engaging introduction to some major ideas, landmarks and (more or less) large-scale developments in American law. As such, it was a very useful guide to a lawyer with no real knowledge of American legal history. A nice, quick introduction which would enable the reader to delve deeper subsequently in some of the issues the book discusses."
4,Enjoyed it more than I expected,"As I read through this pithy summary of American law, I was continually impressed by how rarely I disagreed with this obviously-liberal author's interpretations. Only when he suggested that the jury is still out on whether welfare reform has worked did I wonder what planet he's from.What I found most intriguing was his suggestion that law is a (sometimes lagging) representation of the views of those with influence in society. For me, an ""original intent"" guy regarding Constitutional law, that was an interesting new thought.Despite its title, this is a very interesting book, and a short easy read."
2,"Too much politics, not enough law","This book started out promisingly, and the first part of it is an interesting introduction to American law. Unfortunately, the last half of the book is almost exclusively about politics and administration. He spends whole sections on things like New Deal agencies and Great Society programs. Certainly, these were ""laws"" passed by Congress, but they don't tell us anything about the justice system. If you want to learn about the American legal system, I'd suggest Law 101 instead. It's not historically based, but you'll learn a lot more about how the system functions, and the principles on which it is based, than from this book."
5,I like it.,It is the first book I read about law. I borrowed this book from library just want to know a little about law. But it turns out that I really like it and I decided to buy it. I think it make me think a lot about the law itself and the culture of the law and make the law. The only shortcoming is I think it could better if it explains a little more context for each important case. That can help me understand the issue and the background.
5,An excellent book on voltage stability!,"If you are a graduate student or an engineer looking for a comprehensive book to help you understand the problem of voltage stability in power systems, look no more. This is the book to start with. It is very easy to follow, it starts from the beginning and covers a great amount of details. It also provides you with the list of references: a number of published papers and other books. The best thing about it, it is a new book, so it covers the most up-to-date issues. I highly recommend it to all power engineering people out there."
3,Could have,"An eight-year-old boy discovers a family of tiny people living beneath the floorboards of his Victorian country home, but no one will believe him. Eddie Albert plays Pod, the pintsized patriarch of the Clock family, who does everything he can to protect his wife and daughter when their secret is in danger of being revealed. Treated like vermin instead of the magical miracles they really are, the Pods wriggle through narrow escapes after being chased by a dogged cat and a tenacious ferret. TV remakes followed in 1977 and 1992, and the first big screen version was released in 1997 (starring Jim Broadbent as Mr. Clock).Somewhat slow due to too leisurely script-writing, but not bad -- especially for 70s nostalgists.Staci Layne Wilson"
5,BOO AUNT CECELIA,"Aunt Cecelia is absolutely ridiculous. Telling Jessi she can't take Squirt for a walk or go to Mallory's house. But I like how it turned out. In the end Aunt Cecelia is really ok. I liked the name Aunt Dictator! I like this book because it is just SOOOO good! I give it 5 gold stars, but if I could i'd give it 100."
1,It's not what the picture shows,"Very dissapointed with this product, it says 2007 and the picture shows Victor Wooten as he is today, but the dvd is a really old kind of 80's dvd,where he has a moustache and funny colours. I really thought this was a new dvd, so when i figured out what it was i was very dissapointed and mad. They sell it as gold, i could have buy it here in mexico for 2 bucks."
1,"Absolute ""Shocker""","Yes indeed, an absolute shocker. I expected a lot from this DVD. A great disappointment. The playing is great but hardly any lessons in it. I really expected a lot but pardon me for my expression, ""I regret buying this DVD."""
4,Good stuff for the advanced beginner,"This is listed as 2007 but its more like 1993 based on an internet search and the fashion on the video.There are some interesting concepts here. He discusses a basic right hand concept (double thumb, tapping) and then gives the background for it, ideas to take it further on your own and a song to illustrate the concept in action. A complete package.Now with that good stuff said this video is short on instructional material. Once you pull all the performances out (which are there to illustrate points but we will anyway) there is about 15 mins of instruction in here tops.I would say that if you're just getting into bass (under six months), want to have fun and get out of two finger right hand playing then this video will show you some ways to do it. If you're an intermediate player there might be some interesting nuggets here if you stay open to receiving them. If you're an advanced student then you should skip this."
5,Springboard to Storytelling in the Classroom,"The best kind of manual doesn't just provide cookie-cutter activities but allows the readers opportunities to take and make them own. Raising Voices not only is packed with practical yet useful advice, it provides a springboard for one's own creative ideas to bring to the young tellers."
1,Noisy after 2-3 days!,"I give this product zero stars for making noises every 2-3 days, meaning it will need a cleaning every 2-3 days. Finally had enough of this annoying machine that I threw it in the dumpster. Air purifiers from ""The Sharper but Noisier Image"" will never set a foot in my house ever again! Stay away!"
2,Very disappointing!,"I am a big fan of Lisa Jackson, but I have to admit THE NIGHT BEFORE was a major disappointment. It didn't hold my attention like her previous novels, and the plot was just plain boring and predictable. I hope the next one is better."
2,Too Much or Too Little Going On!!!!,"I've read other books by Lisa Jackson, and this one is not her best."
1,The Night Before...what?,"I have read Lisa Jackson before but this was a total disappointment. Unappealing characters, unbelievable sceanrios, slow-thinking police, all contrive to form a disjointed, close-to-boring read. Save your money, readers. She can do better."
5,Great thriller!,"I have never read a book by Lisa before, but I have to say that this won't be my last. I loved this novel. The main character, Catherine Montgomery Bandeaux, wakes up in her room covered in blood, just to find out that her husband has been murdered. This event plunges Caitie into a web of deceit and betrayal, along with the meeting of Adam Hunt, a sexy guy she falls for. While Caitie uncovers the truth about her husband's death, more murders occur, which sends the already vulnerable Caitie on a rollercoaster of emotions. Should she trust Adam or should see try something else...anything else? This novel is great with a surprising ending that will knock your socks off!"
4,The Night Before,"Good mystery book but not one of her best one that I enjoyed. Good Author, will still buy her books."
4,THE NIGHT BEFORE,GREAT BOOK. STORY PLOT IS GREAT. I READ THIS BOOK IN 2 DAYS ON MY KINDLE...THIS IS HOW GOOD THE STORY IS
3,The Night Before by Lisa Jackson,"This book was readable, but not very exciting.Would of liked more body to the book, and much betterstory."
3,The Night Before Kept Me Guessing,I did enjoy reading this book. I thought the Montgomery family was pretty dysfunctional. I love to read suspense books that shock me with who the villian really turns out to be.
3,I have read better Lisa Jackson,"It was a decent read, sometimes Lisa Jackson is too wordy but I skip through it. The story was ok, but I have read much better Jackson novels for sure. Characters were not as good as other books, still worth a read, but don't spend $ on it if you can avoid it."
5,Awesome,"I'm not done yet, but I'm riveted! Can't put it down. Great story line, haven't figured out who-done-it. Can't wait to read the next one."
1,Disappoining,"Very disappointed in this book. Have read many of Lisa Jacksons books and have found them to be exciting and suspenseful with a believable story line. I honestly thought this book was ridiculous. Will try one more of Lisa's books and if it is as bad as The Night Before, she will be one author crossed off my list."
2,Too Long and Repetitive,"The story was okay, but the book could have been cut 100 pages. The biggest problems with this book was the excessive incest and repetitiveness.The characters also never seemed to develop in a book this size. The female cop, Morrisette, was the most aggravating character in the book. Everytime she opened her mouth all I could think was how much more stupid can this character get. The cops were bumbling idiots who were going around in circles.There was something missing with this book. I bought the Morning After, and I hope its better. But if the character Reed is the protagonist, I'm already doubting it."
1,"Well, this was... different...","Of all the repetitive, unlikely, unengaging books this has to be the absolute top of the list. As a matter of fact, the most appealing characters in this monumental work are the lead detective's sidekick's kids--largely because we never meet them. The whole thing makes you wonder if the editor was literate or even awake. Else it's virtually impossible to miss such gems as 'water foul'--those smelly swimming birds--or the schizophrenic, DID-afflicted, twin-channeling (so what's it to be?!) heroine pulling on her 'pasties'--to walk around festooned in snack food, I suppose.Save your money!"
5,Just the best!,"I have read every book Lisa Jackson has written and I am quite a fan. This book kept my attention from page one. So, maybe a few things were predictable, but she comes through at the end and gives you what you want in a thriller. A TWIST. As long as Lisa keeps writing, I will keep buying. I am retired and I read a lot. She can't write fast enough."
2,Slow moving and not enthralling,"I wanted something with intrigue and mystery, a real page turner I wouldn't be able to put down. Something where I'd be dying to know who the killer was, and eager to get to the end. I can't finish it. I'm bored to death. I don't even care who did it. It didn't [draw] me in at all. I keep waiting for it to really get rolling."
5,"Awesome, suspensful novel!","This book was suspensful right down to the last page. When Caitlyn Montgomery-Bandeaux's husband, Josh Bandeaux is murdered in his home one night, Caitlyn can't remember anything that happened to her the night before. Now, Detective's Reed and Morisette with the Savannah Police Department have suspected Caitlyn of brutally murdering her husband, even though the two were separated. The detective's find Caitlyn to be their number one suspect because #1 Josh was cheating on her with a woman named Naomi Cristman, and #2 Josh was going to file a wrongful death suit against his wife for the death of their child. Now, the detectives find that Caitlyn has a real skimpy alibi about where she was the night before. Did Caitlyn really kill her husband?!?!This book keeps you in suspense until the last page!! It's a great novel for anyone who likes suspense and romance all wrapped into one!"
5,MURDER MYSTERY,"There are two books in the sequence, this one, and The Day After. I bought both of them and they are great reading. This one is better than the second one, but on the whole, both are terrific."
1,dud -predictable and boring,"This is the 4th or 5th book I have read by this author and it seems that they are hit or miss. This is a miss. The main character Caitlyn is unstable, naive, and if you haven't realized by the 3rd chapter that she has a split personality...Her husband is murdered in the middle of a divorce and his lawsuit against her in the wrongful death of their child, but sympathy is hard to find becuase her weak character managed to get knocked up by the husband then marry him in the first place, who is widely known as a gold-digging, manwhoring, crook.I actually couldn't bear to finish this. I skimmed to find out who the killer was and found myself liking that character the best. At least they had personality. Skip this one."
5,Loved this story,"This fast paced western is an entertaining read about Michael Patrick O'Bannon, owner of a large ranch and going concern in Texas until one day he finds himself faced with some ill-begotten ranch stealers who attempt to take over the lands. While their claim of the lands no longer belonging to Michael appear to hold water, Michael knows better and has to make some fast moves to save his spread, culminating in a full fledged gunfight to the death. While the circumstances are fictional, the story is written around period events and is colored with period history. A great read in the flavor of Louis L'Amour."
5,Nice!,"Oh so old fashioned sweet, romantic adventure! Warm, na&#1111;ve, and full of high spirit. Love it!Didn't realize how I missed an old good western )))"
5,Our 2 Year Old's Favorite Book!,"I knew our 2 year old daughter liked trains when I bought this book, but I had no idea it would be such a hit! She carries it with her everywhere and we ready it over and over. The lovely, bright illustrations have lots of detail, so there are many things we can talk about. (If mommy and daddy get tired ready the story over and over!)We had to order a new copy, since the first one was literally loved to pieces!"
2,OKAY...BUT NOT THE BEST.,"I only gave this song 2 stars for it's possitive message. Most Hip-Hop and Rap songs these days are all negative with lyrics like sex, sexy women/men, drugs, girlfriend/boyfriend issues, etc. ""What Would You Do"" actually carries out a possitve message. However, the song got kind of old because of the constant radio plays. I also really don't like the beat of the music all that much. City High is not the best Hip-Hop group out there. There is much better Hip-Hop music out there today. I don't even really like City High's voices all that much. And in one part of this song, they copy the beat of Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg's ""The Next Episode"". Personally, I wouldn't buy this CD or anything by City High for that matter. It's a good song, but it's better if you just listen to it on the radio rather than buy this CD-Single. However, if you like this song, then this would definitely be for you. If not, then don't even bother."
5,Great cd,This cd is wonderful. If you like the song what would you do but dont like most of the other songs on the album then this is the cd for you.
5,This Is Off The Hook!!!,"City High is the next heat of R&B to be realeased soon. I have been listening to ""What Would You Do"" for ever a year now. I loved it the first time i ever heard it. You Have To Get This!"
5,Awesome song!!!!!,this song is awesome! it has a great message behind! everyone should get this song!!
5,a wonderful introduction to John Hay,"David Gessner does us all an immense service with this lovely description of his friendship with John Hay--the much-too-poorly-known dean of American nature writers. Gessner captures the spirt of this charming and visionary man at the end of his life. John Hay's dedication to place, family, and language, and his intense relationship with the natural world are an inspiration. Bravo!"
5,The Best of His Best!,"I first heard Jonn on a collection of Native American music. I had to buy this CD for the musical content. I was not disappointed by this or his other wonderful CD's.If you can feel music in your soul and have it lift you, then this is for you. Jonn will give you strength and balance.Meditate, soul search, or just listen to this fine CD and you will be sold on Jonn's deep routed talents."
3,Took a little time,"I would have been more prepared for this c.d. if I had first gotten my expectations out of the way. ""Wind Walker"", the third track, was the only piece that immediately appealed to me with its rich, upbeat nature and keyboard dominant melody. Otherwise, I was extremely disappointed with the Native American themed c.d. at first. It wasn't until after several listenings that I was able to begin to appreciate the rest of the c.d. Now I am able to listen to the c.d for what it is without wishing for the ""old"" Jonn Serrie. Anyway, I'm sure the ""old"" Jonn Serrie will be back in due time."
2,"Typical new age, nothing new or cutting edge here","I bought this CD on the power of the reviews that I have read here and was surely dissapointed. John is a good musician but, not anywhere close to cutting edge or charting any new territory. The reviews here would much better describe Steve Roach or Robert Rich, An OK CD, but limit your expections"
2,I fell asleep,"This video is a collection of 3 stories of 3 female ""ninja"". I have not seen the whole video as my headline describes very clearly."
4,Personal Styles and Effective Performance,"One of the best resources to really understand the ""Social Styles"" personality typology. Written by the pioneer researcher, the book is written with the rigour of a personality theorist, but is very accessible and applicable."
5,Perfect fit,Did exactly what the purchase was required to do. There was no surprises on this item. Fit right in and did the job that was required.
1,Falls Apart,"After about 6 months of use I was putting this cover back on my grill and a 2 foot seem ripped open right in the middle. I was being pretty careful when it happened too. It basically just fell apart. Unless you want to buy a new cover every 6 months, I'd steer clear of this brand.I bought the cover for my new grill just as Winter started. Never used it until Spring. After taking it off and putting it on about 6 times, the thing fell apart."
2,flimsy cover,The cover is very flimsy as far as the sewing on the seams. It started to rip the first time I put it on the grill. But now that I know that I just put it on very carefully. It does look nice.
1,HORRIBLE!,this cover started ripping less than a month after i got it. i tried to sew it but there was no point. it is ripped in a million places. now i drape its ripped remnants over the grill as best I can. it's pretty pathetic.
1,terrible,"tore very quickly, and barely fits if you have the side fire box on one side and the propane burner on the other."
1,Don't waste your money,"The Char-Griller with the side smoking box is an excellent smoker/griller. Far superior to its cousin, the Char-broiler. But this review is for the cover. Don't waste your money. The sharp edges of the wooden slats will tear this cover before the end of your first season of grilling. I keep my Char-griller in the garage so I don't need the cover anymore. Too bad that they don't make a heavy duty cover similar to the covers that Weber makes for their grills. Those covers are quality."
3,Average grill cover,"THis grill cover is only good for about 2 years max in the Texas heat. After 2 yrs the sun, heat, wind, etc. leaves this thing in tatters. It doesn't just hold up. But, it is hard to find a grill cover for my Kingsford grill that is shaped similarly."
1,Falls Apart,I've had it for less than a year and it's falling apart. I stopped covering the grill since water was actually leaking through and getting trapped under the cover. I'm wondering if anyone makes a similar cover out of better material.
2,Jerry Wallace re-sings his hits,"I was disappointed to find that these songs were sung by Jerry after his voice had started to fade with age. While the selections are great, if you are like me and prefer the ORIGINAL recordings, this one is not for you. Jerry does a good job , but the voice quality is not the same as it was ""back when"". This is acceptable if you are fan of his, because apparently there are no GOOD QUALITY original versions on CD."
5,Jerry Wallace Greatest Hits [King],"This is a very good album.True,his voice seems to waver at times but isn't that what a producer is for?There should have been a few retakes on a couple of songs.Bear in mind he was in his 60's when the CD was recorded.""Life's Gone and Slippped Away"" is one of the best songs he ever recorded.So true to life.Jerry is one of the greatest singers that ever lived though he simply didn't get the breaks that some did.Jerry,issue some more of your songs.God bless you Jerry Wallace wherever you are."
4,Good info,"Book had some good info that I have heard before, but it was good to get the ideas back into the head. Dragon and wizard theory was good in parts. But best point is to tackle the problems that you have control over, and let go of the the things you can't control."
5,The Anxiety Cure,"I have just recently acquired this book, and within an hour I felt like I was on the right track to deliver a knock out punch to this little dragon that has been messing with me for many years. I fully expect to win this one, and as I progress, I'll tell you more."
5,You owe it to yourself,"This book has helped immensely with my anxiety disorder. When it first hit me I had no idea what was happening. If I did not acquire the book and follow the steps outlined in it, I would be incapacitated by now. I confronted the fear--it was tough--but succeeded and am so much better off because of it. I highly recommend this book for anyone who suffers from any kind of anxiety disorder."
2,Narrow Focus,"This book is not about curing anxiety, it is about curing phobias. It does not address any other forms of anxiety, and says nearly nothing about GAD- generalized Anxiety Disorder. If you are starting from absolute ignorance about phobias, agoraphobia or current treatments, it might be worth while as a starting point. If you suffer from anxiety which does not present as a phobia or panic attack, there is little here for you. The advice, in summary, is to expose yourself to your fears and get over it. Kinda simple."
1,fantasy showed promise from review,"This book showed promise but got bogged down somehow. I lost interest....Too detailed and too long....Journeys and more journeys. Hardships and more hardships....It was beginning to be very repetitive. Would have been better if shortened. Guess I'm not very patient, but a well written book keeps me going."
5,Fantasic,"This book is definitely for all those Eragon, Eldest fans out there. It has all the pace, action and sensation of those books with a female perspective. Worth every cent of the 25 dollars i paid for the book!!! :)"
4,"Enjoyable, but difficult to get into...",I began to really enjoy this first book in the series about half way through the book (I had thought I would read it and not the rest of the series) and then couldn't wait to finish and start the second book and now am beginning the third book. I'm looking forward to reading it and then going on to the fourth book to see what the outcome is.It's not the type of book I normally read so I'm pleasantly surprised that I've really gotten into the series as I have.
5,Wonderful!,"I know this story has a bit of a Cinderella motif, however Cinderella didn't have powers and destroy evil...ever! I dont think there are enough female heroines these days and I am happy that Alison Croggon has the imagination to create such a complex and strong main character. I love the entire series and recommend it to anyone that asks!"
3,A long winded legend.,"Well, not-so-good things first: It was awfully long. While the descriptions of the dull miserable-ness of travelling on horseback over barren planes were very realistic, I think it could have been condensed a lot more, it took ages to finish and I found myself actually skipping half a page out of boredome, something I very rarely do with books. Also the plot is a complete cliche. Some things seemed to be taken straight out of other books, the Ice Witch was just TOO Narnia and the whole Fated One business TOO Harry Potter.BUT (A big but) I still think it was a good book! It had definate legend qualities to it, the initiation, Rachida, Norloch, they were original and well described making a very magical picture in my mind. The characters were brilliant. I had quite fallen in love with most of them by the end of the book, Cadvan especially. A last thing, the poetry! The lays at the beginning of each part were a marvellous touch."
3,Just too slow.,"Just plodded through this one. I liked the characters and the prose was intelligent. But the plot, urgh!, too slow and ponderous, not enough action and protagonists were cloyingly good.There are better options out there."
3,Reminds you of the Terry Brooks Shannara series,"The three stars is not for the fact that I have read them, it is in fact for the reason that I have not yet read these books but from the reviews I have read the books sound very much like the Shannara series from Terry Brooks which also have a distinct Tolkien quality. With that being said I plan to read the first book and then I will make another review."
2,SELF LOATHING,"THIS BOOK IS OK. IT IS A PREDICTABLE FANTASY AND IT IS SOME WHAT ENJOYABLE. BUT I AM SO TIRE OF WRITERS HAVING THEIR HEROES FEELING BAD ABOUT KILLING THINGS THAT ARE TRYING TO KILL THEM. JUST STOP IT! PEOPLE FEEL RELIEVED WHEN WHAT EVER IS TRYING TO MURDER THEM FAILS TO DO SO. WE DO NOT NEED OUR HEROES TO BE SAINTS, WE NEED THEM TO BE REAL."
5,~*~One of the Best~*~,"This book has to be one of my favorites. It is has a creative new plot, and is beautifully written. I love to read fantasy books, but all the ones I have read lately have been kinda 'blah' or just plain boring. Not this one, I am DYING for 'The Riddle.'I recommend 'The Naming' to all ages."
2,Chet Atkins Certified Guitar,"Disappointed in this,too much chatter and not enough on Chet Atkins. These multi star concerts become an ego trip for most participants and then lose sight of what it supposed to be about - CHET ATKINS GUITAR WORK!"
4,Correction,Contacted by seller and the DVD was forwarded. Fantastic performances and highly recommend this product and future dealings with Digital Row!
5,Quitessential Chet Atkins,"This DVD is Mr. Guitar showing his great musical talent and also his caring for and helping others.The 1950s and 1960s were my teen and young adult years. I always wanted to play guitar like Chet Atkins. And The Everly Brothers were one of my favorite singing groups(In my 40s I learned how to strum a guitar. Even now I play most days to relax. But, I can't even follow Chet's chord fingering!)This DVD brings back memories of my early days of listening to and appreciating great music. It also is a testimonial to a great musician and humanitarian.I'll also buy a copy for my son who plays guitar much better than me."
5,Great Collectors DVD,The DVD arrived quickly and in great condition. This is a once-in-a-lifetime performance of very accomplished musicians and vocalists. Chet Atkins is the best guitar player ever!
4,Chet Atkins' Certified Guitar Player,"This is a really great CD, (not a DVD). The sound was taken from the DVD. I have not been able to actually find the DVD for sale, but it must be out there somewhere? You do not often hear Chet sing, but he does on this CD. The other musicians on this CD are remarkable rendering a tribute to Chet"
4,"Chet Atkins, Ceterfied Guitar Player",This performance simply oozes class from every direction.I never knew how many musicians from different generes owedtheir start to this extraordinary man!
2,KISS apron,My daughter loved it........I didn't. She loves Gene Simmons though! I would have not been able to recognize it as Gene Simmons' makeup.
1,Awful,"Just a bunch of made up trash. I thought it was supposed to be a factual account. But even if it's fiction, it is just bad. The guy mixes up Aztec mythology with all the Native American tribes... it just gets worse and worse as it goes along. He's got southwest tribes dealing with plains tribes, I had to quit reading because it was so dumb."
5,Love this watch!,"Not only does this watch compliment every outfit from the most casual to business attire, it also conveys a professional image...from a distance. I absolutely love the expressions when people realize I'm wearing a Mickey Mouse watch. For me, it helps interject humor into otherwise tedious days."
5,Watch,I received great service on the purchase. The package was mailed right away and I received it when I was suppost to. Thanks to everyone that was involved in getting it to me.
3,Water Traps,"In the bathtub these will collect condensation in each of the clear domes. After bathtime if you play with them outside the tub they will dribble water for about a day afterwards. Also, they are supposed to magnetize to each other tail to head etc so they can form a chain, the magnets aren't very strong though so even pulling them gently in the bathtub all linked together causes them to break their grasp.So few bathtub toys so I was desperate and bought them but even DD thinks they are just so so. They have been banished to the sandbox outside instead LOL."
2,My son has never liked these,"All children are different, and for me this was a complete waste of money. My son didn't play with them when he was 1, and we brought them out later. He still didn't. Several times more...he's still completely disinterested. I think it might be because he had soft squishy squirters first and these hard toys didn't interest him. They also turn upside down all the time, which is annoying.You never know what your child will like!"
1,Paint melts,"I love most of the Munchkin toys we have but this set has angered me. We had this set in a basket under our sink in the bathroom. I did not think it gets that hot under the sink but it must have gotten hot enough that the paint melted and stuck onto the squirting animal set we have. Now we have orange, blue, purple, etc. dots on our other bath toys. We put the squirting toys under hot water to try and get some of the paint off. Most of it came off. Not that your child should be in that hot of water but it still worries me that the paint will be able to come off in little ones mouths. If a tooth emerges and possibly scrapes the paint, who knows what they will be ingesting. :-( I would not buy this product again and would not recommend anyone buy these products.Not to mention, I've never even used them in the tub yet. We just washed them and put them under the sink in preparation for our little one. She's 6months old and we are still waiting on using these."
3,OK,"This toy is ok, not great but not bad either. My son (21 mo) has had them for about a year and hasn't really cared for them a ton - but does decide every once in a while that he likes them. They do flip over in the tub a lot, but what is nice is that there are designs on their undersides as well so he can look at those too.But we also leave a few out of the tub and he does like to play with them with his Thomas trains (the small metal ones have magnets) and the turtles can connect to them. Overall, I would say that there has to be better tub toys."
4,Fun in the tub,"We own these, they are durable, easy to clean (don't get mildewy) and link together as they float in the tub. My 1 yr old enjoys them. I like them because they scoop up and dry off easily between baths, as well as stay bright and colorful after a year of bathing. I have even run them through the washing machine."
2,really cute...not well designed!,"I too thought these were really adorable and was very excited for my daughter to play with them at bath time. However, I was saddened to find out that they are very poorly designed. First of all, they float upside down the majority of the time and second they get alot of condensation inside of them...which makes me worry that the interior area that I CANNOT see may be full of mildew. Cute idea...but I think the company needs to rethink the design a bit!"
1,Disappointment,"Somewhere I read that these toys are watertight, but it's not true. Condensation has developed inside both the mirror turtle and the rattle turtle in our set. In fact, the rattle doesn't make noise because the beads are stuck to the side. The entire set also tends to flip upside down when in the water. We still have these next to the tub, and they do provide a little visual interest from time to time, but I would not buy these again or recommend them unless the company makes some design changes. If you are unfortunate enough to have plunked down the money like I did, remember to store the spinning turtles upside down so that the water can drip out between uses. As for the other two, once the water gets in, you may never get it out (just hope your kid doesn't suck on them.....eeuuuuw!)"
5,Great set!,"We use these bath toys inside and outside of the bathtub :- ) they are very well done, good quality and grab your Childs attention of you are looking for this kind of activity in the bath tub. They also hold up pretty well. All and all, I would recommend this set."
3,Promotes a diet that is sugar free and vegan.,"For many people the diet they suggest would be a major change. Here's the basics: Zero meats/dairy/eggs. Zero sugar. Three vegetables a day. Five whole grains a day. Three fruits a day. Two legumes (beans/peas/lentils) a day. I havn't read the whole book as this is not a diet I am willing to live on. For those of you who are, more power (and health) to you!"
2,Interesting verismo opera,"Disappointing recording of Leoncavallo's early opera.The orchestra and recording quality are quite good, however, the soloists are a rag-tag bunch of second rate provincial Italian opera house singers.There is frequent under pitch singing particularly in ensembles where can-belto competition generally rules. The lead tenor is very strained. Only recommended to students of verismo opera not the general public."
3,Ok..It's still working after a year. 12.08 to 12.09,"OK..This is the first review here.This camera...well..It's still working (one year as of 01.2009). I originally tried this product with the receiver inside (of course) and the camera outside through one 2x4 wall to about 60' and the picture was visible but very staticy; not a consistant clear picture. No known interference.I've moved it to within 25' and it seems to work very good. The picture quality is what you'd expect from a the lens specs I think. Not real high end IMHO. The motion sensor is quick and the motion/camera bar is adjustable in relation to the solar panel.Seems pricey although I didn't see anything much less expensive at the time. Also, wired or non-solar wireless were a bit less expensive at the time. Personally, I like wired systems but a lot may have changed in a year..."
3,Mild Tepid,"I have it on CD in the truck, and it's ok for a couple-chuckle... tops, and I am being generous. You will live a full happy life without it.Unless you are a rabid fan or a totality collector of David Frye; skip it and grab a vintage Leary or Sandler from the 1990s. Same era, right?You'll cry laughing or embarrass yourself trying to hold the laughs in while on the MTA commuting home with your headset on.You follow that parting shot advice.Cheers !"
1,Bring back Tricky Dick!,Give me a break! David Frye doing Bill Clinton is like the Strawberry Alarm Clock covering Alanis Morrisette songs. Hasn't our President suffered enough humiliation this year?
1,A good disc to use for skeet shooting practice... PULL!,"This is the worst comedy album I have ever experienced. I listened to the whole thing, and I feel like it robbed me of a precious hour of my life. The impersonations are lousy, and the jokes are so bad you'll wonder why you took the time to enter your credit card information. On the good side, the disc is light, and I discovered that I could throw it over fifty yards!"
2,The Bible and The Piano,"I was extremely disappointed. I had expected a spoken version of the New Testament. Instead, I got not only a spoken version but a spoken version with a piano or some other instrument/s playing in the background. It was very distracting, for example, to listen to the crucifixion in Mark's gospel with a piano banging away. It would be nice if there were some way to mute out the ""music""."
3,Slow Delivery,"My order took over 4 weeks to arrive. The estimated delivery date was incorrect...off by about a week. So if you need them in a hurry you might look elsehere.Overall, pretty happy with the purchase. Shelves pretty easy to hang and make a great addition to our nursery."
5,Excellent book!,"I suffer from this disorder and this book has helped me understand why I am the way I am. I am so very amazed...I feel like the book was written about ME; the author describes to the point the way I act, the way I feel, the way I do things, the way I am. The book helped me identify things, e.g. thought patterns, actions, etc., that I was not even consciously aware of before. My husband is going to start reading it tonight and I hope he will have a better understanding of me and the way I act, because our marriage is on the verge of collapse because of my behavior. I didn't know there was actually a reason for this behavior until I read this book."
3,"Outdated, Repetitive Book That Over-generalizes","This poorly-written, boringly-repetitive book touches on an important subject (obsessiveness) but could do more to help those in need. The authors appear to dislike people who are perfectionists, repeatedly calling patients names and even calling the disease a ""psychic disaster."" A variety of vague stories are told about people who have come to the psychiatrist with anxiety issues, only to have the doctor conclude that these people just need to get over their perfectionism!The solutions are really simplistic and obvious. This book could have been written by just about anybody and may have been better written by a more objective observer. Instead the M.D. author seems bent on trying to break obsessive readers by demeaning them, even heckling them. For those with the disorder it's probably worth reading, but in the end you may feel worse about yourself than when before you started!"
2,Stinker,"The book contains some useful information but the writer is no literary genius. It almost seems as if the book was a second thought. If he is a good doctor, he should stick to that and stay away from writing books. What he posits are negative attributes (in my opinion, and i'm not a PHD, so don't value this) could be useful for certain individuals, and many are useful for me. I contend that you have to be a controlling type personality to be an effective leader. Somebody has to be in control. It seems that if he had his way that everyone would be easy going; imaging an easy going nuclear power plant worker or an easy going military general. Bottom Line: some of what he sees as negative controlling aspects of one's personality are necessary......"
4,Good paperback therapy,"I found this book to be rather helpful. I feely admit to being an OCD person, and this book has helped me put many things into perspective. Wish I had read it earlier in life!"
3,Solid,"I was looking for help dealing with my tendancy to control things. It has increased my personal awareness and as a result I feel more capable of controling my reaction to historically difficult situations. Also, I have noticed an improvement in my relationship with my wife. It is a quick read and utilizes a case study approach of delivery."
5,Not finished but excellent so far.,"Paul Tillich was one of the foremost theologians of the 20th century. We all can profit by his work. Also a more readable book by him is ""The Courage To Be""."
4,Suspense filled until the end,"Daisy Frasier has left her old life in England and has taken on the identity of Lina Pritchett and living in Craggy Rock, Australia. She has completely started her life over with a job a local school teacher, married with a baby on the way. Now this girl really had some baggage that she left behind, but you will have to get the book to find out exactly what it is she is running and hiding from ...I'm not giving it all away. This suspense filled book will keep you turning pages right up until the end....will the now Lina keep away from her past or will it finally catch up with her? What a page turner!Looking forward to reading Emily Barr's other book: Backpack"
3,dragging this baggage,I found the beginning of the book a bit draggy and I wondered why I was reading it -- however it really picked up and it had a very interesting middle with plot twists that made me want to read on --- the ending? -- well I won't comment as I dont want to give anything away ????!!!!!!! --- I just wish it would of been different (hmmmm guess that was a comment)
5,"Finally, Excellent ""Instant"" Coffee!","What a godsend this stuff is! We used to have one of those fancy single-cup brew stations at work but due to budget cuts, they replaced it with an old-style Bunn pour through unit and packaged coffee that tastes more like pencil shavings.Now I just keep a bottle of Cool-Brew in the refrigerator and make superb coffee one cup at a time. I drink it black and it's never bitter, too weak or too strong. At home where I only make coffee on the weekends, I froze Cool-Brew in an ice cube tray and put the resulting coffee cubes in a freezer bag. When I want coffee, I jut pop one of these in a mug, pour boiling water over it and in about 10 seconds I have fantastic coffee at the perfect drinking temperature."
3,"Uneven, but particles of brilliance","This brief collection of Will Self's journalism is mixed--essays range from brilliant to banal. Self has emerges has one of Britain's most interesting writers over the course of the last two decades, and this early collection is a little window into his immense gifts. I was particularly drawn to the piece about feminist Andrea Dworkin, in whom Will sees an underappreciated political voice. And yes, there is plenty to hear about drugs, Martin Amis, and his parents, each of which is probably better served in small doses."
1,This book is a shame,"This is an awful book and those reviews are totally shameful self promoting gimick! It absolutely ruined my day!Coverage of C# is extremely poor, disgustingly poor. Game programming? I am not a game programmer, I might be able to savage something from the source code, but I doubt it.What a shame to the publishing business."
1,Amazingly Poor,"I'm amazed at the good reviews for this book. The only reason I can give for that is that perhaps the good reviews are all from the publisher, author and their many aliases.This book's spelling, grammar, and coding errors make it impossible to use. I'm surprised that the code included on a CD even compiles. I was so frustrated after the first two chapters that I wanted to animate the book, just so I could choke it to death.Do yourself a favor, if you want to buy this book just slap yourself in the face and save $30."
4,Very well written,This is a great value and an overall well done book. The C# code in this book ranges from beginner to intermediate level. It also provides a set of classes that makes game development easier. About the only complaint is that he doesn't go over things that would be useful in games like scrolling. But it is a good value and I highly recommend you buy it if you want to make games.
4,Can be a bit hard for the beginner - but worth it!,"Updated: I originally gave this book 1 Star, I've since moved it up to 4 stars.As I began the text, I was confused on why the writer jumps so fast into windows forms, this made it a bit harder, after when I added the DirectX portions I realized that this was the way it had to be, the DirectX classes and the Windows forms had to connect. There were also a few missing files on the CD - also getting me pissed off, it turns out the write emails you the missing files you just need to write him."
4,This book has a lot to offer,"I've read a lot of books and I've read a lot of review, half the time someone loves it, the other half they hate it. In the end it really comes down to comparing it to its alternative. In this case, the alternative is really nothing - sure there is Managed DirectX 9 by Tom Miller (which is great for directX), but it doesn't really cover Game Programming nor does it cover C#. There's also .Net C# game programming (which doesn't come out until Feb 2004).The inside scoup is that this book is a pretty good for learning both C# and Game Programming the GDI+ games run really fast, and the DirectX stuff is fixed through an email patch (the email address is in the book). I've also gotten some help with compiling, right from the author, which is cool."
2,Didn't work,"When I ordered this item, it took quite a while to receive it! When received, the item worked for a short time then stopped.I asked for a replacement and was told to download a return shipping label. I was not able to do this so your staff said they would send me a label in the mail. I waited for quite a while but never received the label. When asked why, staff said to send the item myself and you would credit my account. I wrote back saying I did not want a credit and to send me a label. I am STILL WAITING for the label to come!!?? I will dispute the charge if it is on my credit card so please send me the label!!I am not pleased with the service I am receiving from your company!!"
4,Epic story of Hungarian fight for freedom,"This book by Lajos Zilahy is surprisingly not as well known as it should be. It is an epic story in the tradition of the 19th century novel and recounts the story of Count Dukay, born in 1814 and whose life was intertwined with the Hungarian freedom struggle under the leadership of the legendary Kossuth. It gives a Hungarian view of the ""century in scarlet""- the mid 19th century era when revolution haunted much of Europe. The novel reminded me of Flaubert's ""A Sentimental Education"" that gives a view of the same era in France. ""Century in Scarlet"" deserves the same recognition as Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"" or Mario Vargas Llosa's ""The War of End of the World""."
1,a paid expert for dow corning-biased,this woman is a front for the plastic surgeons and the chemical cos. who are responsible for the largest cover-up of facts in the history of plastic surgery--the media pr and the cruel slap at sick women and children is disgusting--she also came out against agent orange problems (also a DOW product--if the public ever gets the real story in this silicone disaster it wont be thru drs and health persons like her--she is so tainted by dow et/al money that this book reeks --its smells of corporate cover-up and misinformation--GET THE FACTS ON THIS WOMAN AND HER BACKERS!
5,Parenthood and life perfectly captured.,Catherine Bateson's beautiful poetry reveals all the true life emotion of living. In particular the material about giving birth to a sick child in Poems from Ward 17 West displays tangible pain and a sense of alienation. Her use of metaphor is superb - images form above the page as you read. This work exudes authenticity.
3,NOT A FAN,PROS: Protects steering wheelCONS:- difficult to put on- The seems are rough and don't feel good on your handsI wouldn't buy this product.
1,so hard to stretch on wheel!,this is literally sitting in my trunk bc no one i know can fit it on my wheel. i am not sure if there is measurements i did not match up or what but whatever the reason this cover is not covering anything as it sits in my trunk. but considering the price is fair compared to others in the store i guess it is a good buy if you can get it to fit
2,Misleading,"Not really what you would call sports grip and NOT AT ALL A SLIP ON. Expect to struggle with this to get it on. And forget about even getting it on if your wheel is too big, by too big I mean extra small."
1,Odor NEVER goes away. Can't use,"I purchased this item 5 months ago. I tried it in my car for a few days but the strong rubber smell just made it impossible. The smell came onto my hands and I was constantly trying to scrub it off. I tried soaking it in vinegar (twice), putting it in the sun (its literally sat outside now for a month), and the smell isn't any better. The item is useless to me and I'm off to find one that might not stink so bad!"
1,Smells HORRIBLE!!,"I bought this as a christmas present for my dad's truck and let me tell you... whatever chemicals they use to make this cover make for a horrible smell. I aired it outside for three days prior to giving it to my dad and that didn't do the trick, and when I drove it over to his house Christmas morning, it stunk my car up. My dad didn't even want it because of the chemical smell... save your money or choose to spend a few extra dollars for a better product. I ended up throwing this out, I just wanted to get rid of it."
2,smells like cancer,Horrible smell that will stay in your car and on your hands for a looooooong time. My broke *ss got it because I'm ballin on a budget.
3,Steering wheel cover,The cover feels good under the hand gives good grip. Pain in the but to install put the sun to heat up some so it is easy to stretch over the steering wheel. Does have a smell to it which will stink for a bit
3,Fell apart after typical wear in 6 mo.,Nothing special for the price you pay but I would have liked it to have lasted longer. Feel apart by the seams after about 6-8mo of heavy driving. But it was only $7 when I purchased.
4,TOO BIG FOR 2007 HONDA CIVIC,"It would have been a nice product because of its quality vs price ratio, but the cover did not fit my 2007 HONDA CIVIC. I cannot give the product a bad review because NOWHERE does it claim to fit the CIVIC. If anything, I should be mad at HONDA for not sticking to the standard. I did give it one less star because it SMELLS...LIKE A TIRE. (how fitting). I also understand the complaint about the BULK added, but I expected that. I will continue my search for the perfect fit for my 2007 CIVIC, but would buy this again for future vehicles.Decided to give the product to my 16 year old neighbor, who assumed I was giving him a car to go with the cover. Some people's kids!!!Now accepting suggestion for amazon steering wheel products for a 2007 CIVIC...any help?"
5,Nice!,Everything i asked for nothing more nothing less it fit it looks just like the pic shows.....i would recomend it
2,If it is priced low.....,"Lasted about 2 weeks before it started shredding to pieces....The cover is still there, the message grip is almost all but gone!"
2,"eh, i'd pass.",Light weight. Cheap looking. Should have known it wasnt high quality because it was so reasonably priced. Next time i will go to walmart instead
1,Not what I expected.,Disappointed in product. Asked about returning and was told they would just credit my account which did not happen. Ultimately gave one to a family member who broke the first one getting it on and finally got the second one I had bought on with much difficulty. Would not buy again.
2,Cheaply made,This has been falling apart since the day I put it on. I don't recommend it to anyone unless you just need your steering wheel to be thicker.
1,Ugh! Fake Food,"I wanted a sugar splurge but I chose these Shortbreads by mistake... Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Glucono Delta-lactone, Artificial Vanillin and Artificial Butter Flavors... Yuck! If Amazon won't take them back, I'll have to throw them out."
2,an ocean of copied ideas and sheer lack of imagination,"Funny, I thought I had already read Lord of the Flies, but here it is set in Thailand all over again. So, Alex Garland likes Vietnam movies does he? Please send him as many as you can so we can keep him busy watching them and well away from his typewriter in the future. If ever a novel deserved having Leonardo Di Caprio in the film version, it's this one."
2,Nice try,It was good (for a first novel) but I've read better. I wouldn't have read it unless I had to for my writing class. It was hard to get into. It's not worth $13.00 I paid for. If you want to read it I suggest you borrow it from your local library.
5,BRILLIANT,"I cannot imagine how some people felt this was a 'boring' book! I was entraced from the very first page! I have never been to Thailand or Vietnam...it makes it all the more exciting! Garland's words painted incredible scenes in my head- of the beauty and tranquility of the island, to the viciousness of one's soul.I truly recommend this book for anyone with a sense of adventure.A MUST READ!"
2,read it on a train and don't expect much,This book is bound to be passed around by backpackers (hopefully none will buy another copy). I gave mine away as soon as I finished and have not considered the plot or the characters since I turned the last page. Read it while you are stuck on a train and you will be happy.
2,Everyone doesn't think this book is so great...,"Ironically, I was travelling in just the area where this book is set at the time I read it so at first it was very exciting to follow along (of course not to the mysterious island). Unfortunately, soon after the intriging beginning, the book starts to go downhill. It is realistic only so long and then it gets stupid and unbelievable. I found it a pain to finish. The ""..Flies"" parallel is the only reason why it seems to get any attention and I think that it is shallow outside of the copied plot."
2,Dull and pointless,"The book starts out interestingly enough, but halfway through you realize it's all been a set up for nothing. I realize the author was trying to make a statement about the values of western life, but instead has written a terrribly boring novel. The plot is razor-thin, the characters are character-less and the supposed insight winds up not really saying anything at all. A big disappointment."
2,Don't get beached.,"One dimensional story, one dimensional characters.One keeps hoping for somthing sudden to happenin this book that will pull the storyline out ofits duldrums, but the plot lingers in drawn-out and aimless episodes of a young travellerstumbling upon an island in Thailand. One readsthis almost detached and remotely, leaving no sympathy or excitement for the characters within the pages."
3,Glad I Didn't Buy It,"If someone hadn't thrown this book in with a bunch of gift books, I would have never read it. If I hadn't been working my way through said box while recuperating, I wouldn't have read it. If I had anything at all more promising to do with my time, I would have dumped this book in the garbage after 20 pages. But seeing as I didn't dump it, I didn't have to shell out my hard earned cash for it and I was momentarily incapable of doing anything more than reading - I'm glad that I didn't miss the gore at the end and the quirky psychotic interludes of our main character that made the whole book have any redeeming interest.Bottom line - The book's not a keeper, but if you can spare some time in the library on a rainy saturday, open it up somewhere for the last third and enjoy the good bits. Otherwise, this book's all bran and few raisins."
4,Great read for those that explore,"I just finished this book and I was sad to see it end. Alex Garland has done a great job at capturing the essence (travel bug) of what is out there for everyone but is (unfortunately) often only drawn on by the youth. I would recommend this book to those that have experienced their travel bug and would like spits of it thrown back at you. Just be thankful you made it back in one piece - a naive search for truth, beauty and purpose can often end up biting you in the ass. The main character, Richard is an extremely likable guy - a bit whacked, curious, and endlessing searching. I pictured Alex Garland's face (great back cover photo) often for main character Richard. Extra perk."
4,A generational statement,"Being just shy of generation x, I found this book enthralling. Not so much for the story, but for reading the first writer to truly capture what it means to be under thirty in the world today. Analogies between life and video games may seem trite to those of middle age, but they show the power that technology has had over the young adults of today. Comparisons between colors and tie-dye reflects a metaphor that not even children of the sixties would make, but shows the commonplace icon status that the revolutions of generations past hold today. The references to Vietnam raise for discussion the idea that this is how those under thirty see war at the turn of the millenium, not as a place where people distinguish themselves in broad daylight, but as a guerilla-like struggle of stealth. I think Mr. Garland does an admirable job of defining his generation without falling into the trap of simply painting them as disillusioned slackers."
5,Awesome!!,"This is definatly my favorite book! It was like an amazing miniseries on television, I couldn't wait to see the next part! I couldn't put down this book and I reccomend it to all!"
3,"3 stars because, simply - I just didn't like it much","There is so much great stuff in this book - a wonderful writing style, great characters, nicely described settings, and a distinctive voice of the younger generation. With all these elements, this should be a five star, hands down. But...well, I think the story just wasn't for me. As another reader said, I was ethusiastic for the first 60 pages, then found myself first dissapointed, then bored, with where the plot went. (Even the ending failed to creep me much.) I have a feeling the next guy over, however, would be enthralled - and that this rating is just personal taste. Read the book (I recommend it just for its writing alone) and judge for yourself."
4,"""To Each His Own""","I've read the criticisms and I can understand why people have had negative reactions to the book. However, I cannot stop thinking about ""The Beach."" I was fascinated the whole read and was totally surprised by the ending. I didn't think the beach was paradise by any means but the story really held my attention. I guess it just depends on what you like to read."
5,"""Lord of the Flies"" All Grown Up","For everyone enjoyed reading ""Lord of the Flies"" when they were in grammar school, this is the follow-up for you."
1,Wet fart of a book,I don't know why this book has such glowing reviews. Perhaps the backpacker slime that enjoyed this novel shuold write Timothy McVeigh for further literary advice.
1,a waste of my money &time,"it is the most boring book i have ever read since having read a dictionary there are a lot of descriptions so long and unrealistics.The story is classic.The beginning is a kind of treasure hunt but after a few pages there is no more action,just the secret communitylife. I would not recommend the book to my students."
1,It was dull,"He writes pretty well, spare, simple stuff, but nothing that blows wind up my skirt. And it's just a pretty boring story. I managed to get maybe half way through, and then I gave up, because NOTHING was happening and I didn't care.Not worth all the hype. Not worth buying."
1,"I sure hope the movie,""The Beach"" is better than the book","I had heard good things about ""The Beach"" from someone, so I went out and bought it. I am still trying to figure out what was suppose to make this a good read. I forced myself to read the entire book, hoping it would get better and it didn't. The storyline had potential but it went no where. People have compared this to the great classic ""Lord of the Flies"" well, think again...this book doesn't deserve to be in the same category. What I find very amusing is that the movie ""The Beach"" is going to be released in February. Everytime I see I movie based on a book, I always say the book was better. In this case--I sure hope the movie is better or it will open and close on the first weekend."
3,"Addictive, but never quite transcendant","Never quite as evocative, never quite as scary, smart, funny as it could be. Physical description not up to standards: we never know what anyone really looks like, not even much in the way of hints. And all of potential awe-inspiring beauty of the landscape is never brought to life. I kept reading, and griping"
5,The Beach is outstanding!,"The Beach by Alex Garland is one of the most exciting books I have read in years. A wonderful yarn. It details one traveler's search for ""The Beach"" an Eden for 20-somethings. Plenty of action and pop-culture references keep this book rolling. The plot is not unlike a modern day Lord of the Flies"
3,good... not great,"I was expecting more. I read this book after seeing the movie so I could fill in all the plot holes, and while it did it's job, I can't help but say I was a little disappointed by the whole thing... It's not a horrible book, and you wont hate yourself for having read it (like american psycho) but dont tackle each other to buy it"
2,What's wet and smells like fish?,"Stoned, sloppy and wealthy western youth get better than they deserve in the travel ghetto's around the world. Globetrotting in the search for some catatonic Eden in someone else's back yard is typical of the arrogance. The ghettos are there to primarily shield the natives from the westerners, not visa-versa. Garland's ""hallucinogenic"" writing style, suicidal Disney characters and all, is insincere and silly. Richard's epiphany from the jaded and squirrelly into some almost-crucified Christ-like innocent at the story end was unconvincing. It would have been more apropos and less tedious if the dope-freeloading gameboy-playing western beach colony had all been lined up and shot by the Thai drug traffickers 100 pages earlier than this book's ending. This was not an important yarn, but a flatulent yawn."
2,"Fast, cheap, and disappointing","Well, I was given this book as a gift after hearing A LOT of talk about it. And it was okay, I guess, it went by quickly though not altogether painlessly. I just didn't care about ANY of the characters, the story was somewhat interesting, but then only in patches. I was hoping the ending could be a payoff to salvage the rest of the novel, but no such luck. I do think this could be an interesting movie, though Di Caprio(sp?) is going to have to work hard to make anyone care about what happens to this character and after reading the book, I cannot imagine sitting for two more hours, watching these people. Really, don't bother--after all the comparisons are over, The Beach makes you appreciate the brilliance of Lord of the Flies. Save your time--re-read that one."
2,ONLY FOR 20 SOMETHINGS?,"I read the story in two sittings. Unfortunately, I thought it was too weird for anyone over 30. The ending was grotesque; I love it when a book keeps me thinking about it days or weeks after I've read it. However, this is one memory I want to go away quickly. Don't think I'll read any sequels; don't think I'll waste my money on the movie."
3,Beautiful but deeply flawed,"Garland describes the beach and the lagoon beautifully, but he also drags in intellectual content that he doesn't seem to know what to do with. For example, the idea of infinite possible worlds comes to nothing. The narrator Richard is a believable, brave, flawed guy, but Garland doesn't seem to know if he wants us to take Richard as hero or anti-hero.Toward the end, Garland doesn't seem to know quite how to finish, so he throws in some gratuitous violence and murders. It could have been rounded off much better!By the way, what in the world is a ""thousand-yard stare"" (last page)?Recommended, with reservations."
4,great read - unexpected ending,"I read the book whilst on holiday in thailand which added atmosphere to the read. Great story, turning the pages furiously but was slightly disappointed with ending. I feel it could have bee a bit more sophisticated like the rest of the book."
4,Apolcayse Now meets Lord of the Flies,This much talked about novel which is reminiscent of scenes from Lord of the Flies and has vague parralelisms from Apocalypse Now is an excellent debut for Garland. Richard's fantasies and paranoias are cleverly displayed through the use of Mr.Duck (especially in the last scene appearing as the unforgettable Brando- oh the horror). Tension is built gradually to what a reader would expect to be a nail biting and dramatic finale but this never materializes leaving the reader somewhat dissapointed. Leonardo is a big mistake- an American and a pretty boy! I would prefer someone like Ewan McGregor to take on the role.
3,I travelled this country 28 years ago during Vietnam War.,"Back in 1970 as an ex-Peace Corps Volunteer I traveled throughout Southeast Asia, hitchhiking where possible - Malaysia yes, Thailand no - and sleeping on the deck of a Thai boat making its way down the coast to Malaysia - stopping at an island that easily could double for the one in The Beach. Reading the book was thus eerie: in those days Vietnam was very real, not a movie; and Southeast Asia wasn't a tourist destination other than GIs on r and r. Interesting book. The interest in Vietnam - or movies about Vietnam - by the central character shows that it hasn't been forgotten. And the view of Southeast Asia in the book is at odds with my memory of it - mysterious, beautiful, confounding. I guess that's why the backpackers went looking for that pristine island. Again, an interesting book that got me to thinking about a very interesting - and different - time."
4,Can an individual honestly exist in a crowd mentality,"I enjoyed the read. The interplay of group mentality (social and psychological) vs. individuality was very interesting. I found the subtle mechanics of Richard's seemingly to assimilate into the ""group"" to parallel what is found in a few corporations. Alex must have experienced life to a fuller extent than most his age. The layers and players fit together beautifully. I hope that the film is not ""Americanized"" but stays within his vision."
2,Flash backs of Treasure Island ?,"Alex Garland has plenty of talent, but for some reason he couldn't finish the book the way it started. The creative flow ran out of fuel when Richard found the beach.(Advice, That would be the ideal spot to move onto another book.) If you are interested in fishing and gardening, then continue with the last half. Basically the book turns into lord of the flies in the last chapter. It even has a the same story plot as Treasure Island in the begining, it makes me wonder sometimes. I still can't believe it was made into a movie!!"
2,Eh.........,"It wasn't a bad book, really, but it didn't do much for me. I found myself thinking 'Lord of the Flies' the entire time I was reading about young Richard and his exploits. If this book is in your 'Maybe Read' pile, I'd say just watch the movie with Leonardo DiCaprio. The scenery there is awesome and more relationships develop on screen than in the book. Most of the movie follows the book in lockstep. There is some crazy violence in the book that didn't make it to the big screen, however.You never know - you might like it. For me, though, it was a fairly unmemorable book."
1,How can anyone like this book? Please tell me.,"This book made me very upset. I looked forward to reading it, but I found it terribly dull and static. Just a group of people spending months doing nothing in a remote beach in the Gulf of Thailand. Is that interesting or fascinating? I waited and waited for something interesting to happen, but nothing changed. I must admit it: I didn't finish it; I couldn't read more than 300 pages (2/3 of the book) and it has not been easy, believe me."
1,The WORST,"Can't believe people like this book so much. It never engaged me, never seemed believable or anything more than the stolen stories of Lord of the Flies and Robinson Crusoe combined. Lame and worst of all not even a good beach read!"
2,Dope Addicted Teenager Suffers Emotional Problems,"This book was nothing more than a drug-lovers novel written for crack-addicted hippies all over. Murder, lies, law-breaking and sex are common place, making a horrifying, yet strangely realistic story. A romantic eden collapses into hell, during which the characters minds develop towards insanity and memories that will never be forgotten... never judge a book by it's movie or those that star in it, horribly misleading. I watched the movie before I read the book and it gave me terrible preconceptions about the book, which eventually were proven untrue."
2,Good First Effort,"The Beach is certainly an impressive effort for a young man still in his twenties. I can certainly understand the ecstatic reviews - especially from the younger readers - readers still void of real life experience.The story line however, is sadly reminiscent of the pop reality of the late sixties with all the same ingredients, youth throwing off the shackles of responsibility, unlimited drugs, and adventure in an exotic land. This read will have a special appeal for the feminine gender with its copious doses of love and affection, although the contrived relationships are base and deceitful in their entirety.I look forward to Garland's further efforts as he becomes more seasoned and begins to write for a broader and more mature audience."
5,One of the best of the past decade,"""The Beach"" is, in my opinion, one of the best books made in this past decade. It is a real page-turner, as many people have described it. Garland captures real excitment in this almost modern day ""Lord of the Flies.""I would tell anyone to read this before seeing the movie, which has been changed from the book in many ways. The movie is good, but the book is much better."
4,An Generation X book for sure,I thought that it was a great book and flowed really well. I felt that he could have gone a little more in depth on some of the characters that you do not really get a chance to meet bringing out the conflict between them a little better. It was very entertaining and would suggest it to anyone that likes a reality break.
4,What we all think about at 3am in the morning..well I do,"Not the greatest book every written but there are thoughts and words in the novel that are usually hidden deep in our sub-concious or fantasies anyway!The day-dreaming segments were really clever, he captured what its really like to be stoned... Richard is a very real person for our generation,not unsacthingly honest but containing all the basic flaws of human nature, cruelty, deceit loyalty etc! To anyone who has travelled we should all recognise someone in the book, well I did! I was a bit disappointed with ending though the reality of a year later I thought was very clever, they were just where I imagined them all to be. Leo as Richard mmmm not sure on that one surely there is enough British talent out there to have given the part to. I am reading it again now and I am sure to find more I like second time round, if you haven't yet read it, go ahead and find out what all the fuss is about."
4,"A great weekend read, a classic page-turner","I got recommended this book when I was on Koh Samui last year by a traveller who spent the previous year in the Golden Triangle. I didn't get hold of a copy until six months later. This seems to have been the right time to have read it because I looked forward to reading it. I must say it is a great read, but to mark it as a classic is going to far.I don't know, I feel slightly insulted by Garland's portrayal of the visitors to Koh Samui and Koh Pangyan and his heroes hollier-than-thou attitude towards them. I haven't finished the book yet (page 301), but I feel their whole mythos is fatalistic and flawed.Still I'm back in Thailand this year and I can't wait...Just my two pence! Read it! Its fun !"
3,The book was ok.,The book was very interesting and i enjoyed it. I also recommend it to any one who loves to read.
4,"taut, exciting, and provacative read","Garland's debut effort introduces us to a gifted story-teller with a bright future. Focussing on the disenchantment of the current ""generation x"" and the search for worthy experience in a seemingly homogenious world, the story ultimately raises serious questions about the contemporary youth. Complete with suspense that draws the reader in a cleverly designed sublty, the novel is entertaining in the least, and at best serves as a serious wakeup call to the consequences of disenchanted future leaders of the world."
4,Enjoyable novel,"Imagine Lord of the Flies with twenty-somethings from the nineties, and you get an idea of what ""The Beach"" is like. The story is set in Thailand. If you've ever backpacked through Thailand, you will read about many familiar feelings and sights in the country. An enjoyable novel."
2,Disappointing,"The publicity of this book is what got me interested in the first place. Overall, however, I found it to be disappointing. I did like the style it was written in, and there were concepts I enjoyed, namely thoughts on travelling in general, and the differences between tourists and travelers. The plot, however, was a big build up, then the story just fell apart in the end. And that nonsense about mutilating the corpses--what was that about? The story had potential, but it failed to deliver!"
3,It's a recomendable book!,"I read ""The Beach"" in the English lessons at school. I found it very interesting and full of ideas relevant to readers and thinkers of all ages. It has got avery interesting action and I often thought of the problems and situations Richard finds himself in. The charakters in the book are well thought out. One critic is that in my opinion at the beginning the discription of the people and the area is too long and a little bit boring."
3,decent - but no lord of the flies,"This is a book you will finish very fast...it is like lord of the flies, but not as good of a story. The build-up to the ending was not detailed enough to make it completely believeable. Worth spending an evening reading this versus watching the movie."
4,In Search For Something Beautfiul and Exciting Then Before,"This book shows very loose reminisence to the movie but is one of the best works I've read coming from a author of his first book. If you love adventure, and searching for somthing exciting, then you would love to read this. It was tantalizing, a natural page turner, reviting at points. It's amazing what this book can do to a person."
3,Draws you in and dumps you...,"I agree with many of the commenters that, while Alex Garland is a very good writer, this story left me scratching my head at its lack of conclusiveness. There's no achoring theme or conclusory message to this tale. Although it was a total page turner, no doubt about that, when I got to the end, all I could say was, ""WHAT?! That's it?"". No lessons learned or even alluded to for the main character. No vindications or revelations. So, it was kind of disappointing in the end. One really has to draw one's own conclusions and take it for whatever personal ""lessons"" the reader gets out of it."
4,fun read,"Alex Garland's ""The Beach"" is a fun read that reminds me of Lord of the Flies. Garland, who has gone on to create atrocities like Dredd 3D, is at his peak here. A bunch of Gen-Xers, marijuana farmers, secret beaches, utopias gone wrong, etc. make this really entertaining. Not classic literature, but worth the time anyway. Much better than the movie."
5,Loved it and didn't want it to end!,"""The Beach"" is a fantastic novel! Great writing, believable characters, gripping story-line, twists and turns and thrills all combine to make this one that you won't be able to put down. I wish I had read it slower, or that is was longer (and it's not short). Much better than the movie!"
5,Unexpectedly loved it!,"This may have been more of a 4.5-er for me, but I'm rounding up instead of down because it kept me so dang engrossed. I mean, I dreamt this thing at night, which was...well, not so pleasant, actually! It's one of those books where you know things aren't going to end so well, and you spend the entire time waiting to find out how exactly it's going to happen. The book depicts a slow disintigration--of community, of morality, of sanity, and of paradise. It's a mashup of Vietnam War movies, Conrad's Heart of Darkness, video games, and travel literature about unspoiled Edens, and half of it seems to take place in the alternate reality of main character Richard's headspace, which worked really well for me. I can see myself reading this again at some point down the line, and I am definitely looking forward to watching the movie, which I have never gotten around to doing (now I'm glad I waited). I'll definitely be checking out some of Garland's other novels as well."
4,Excellent read,"Great book, excellent writing. Leaves you turning the pages and feeling uncomfortable and nervous with what's happening in the book. Very nice."
4,Entertaining beach read :-),I really enjoyed this book. The characters were interesting and entertaining. I found the story to be really imaginative and exciting. This book inspired me to go back-packing in Thailand. I've already booked the plane tickets!!
2,Dopes in Dystopia,This novel struck me as an overly lengthy magazine piece that only served to point up the authors youthful inability to deal with the so-called weighty issues he hoped to tackle. By turns boring and uninvolving it proved to be mere fodder fiction for superficial readers everywhere. The very fact that Leonardo himself has been cast to play the lead in this thinly disguised movie treatment should be warning enough. This could very well be the first video release ever put out in soft cover.
3,Gen-X nicotine- addict finds home with not-so-exotic losers,"The one thing I can say for this book is that I DID like the main character, but he was the only one. At times the narration was good, and I especially liked the parts where he was stoned. That alone should send up a few flags. I was a bit puzzled when nothing was happening in the first 160 pages, but when the plot got going, I'll admit to being a little hooked. However, I would hate to think that Richard, despite his flashes of nobility and his ability to amuse me, would be chosen as the fiction protagonist who represents my generation. I like to think that the perks of paradise involve something more significant and fulfilling than marijuana and tropical scenery."
2,A puerile rip off of heart of darkness and lord of the flies,"I really wanted to like the book but I found the characters hollow and any ""tension"" to be superficial. This is a pop culture book that has no soul. Alex steals from Heart of Darkness (specifically Apocalypse Now) and Lord of The Flies. Unfortunately, the pieces do no fit very well and leaves the reader with a bad taste in the mouth. Most of my friends love this book but I had to force my way through it. YMMV"
2,????????????,"I can't believe I wasted my time actually reading this thing, After seeing some of the rave reviews I stuck it out til the end, puzzling that somewhere in this excuse for a novel there would be something worth reading sooner or later. What is particularly galling is the readers in Amazon who found Garland's book The Tesseract to be a letdown from this one. I read Tesseract first, and after I got past the first part of the story found it extremely engaging. The movie industry should forget about giving Leonardo de Caprio a day at The Beach. This novel reads like the script of a made-for-TV movie: cliched, strung out with just a enough teasers to keep you watching until the next commercial."
3,Sorry Thailand,"The Beach is a good book. Garland expertly catches the transparency of pop culture youth. The character sketching is suitably scant ( during my reading, I found my mind drifting away and amusingly wondered how they would react if their mothers arrived by boat on a 'two week cruise of Thai islands - with free golfing excursions' ). The narrative is quick and the plot structure adequate for a book that never achieves the depth of the lagoons it describes. My only worry is that hoards of young 'travellers' ( minus parents ) will descend on Thailand - a country that is yet to be invaded - drunk on western pop culture. Costa Del Thailand here we come."
4,fear and loathing in utopia,"This reads like a lonely planet guide to utopia, via joseph conrad's heart of darkness. it has the twists, bells and whistles of great adventure writing, the pop culture in-jokes, crisp dialogue, coming-of-age undertones and true narrative ease. maybe some of the mysterious characters needed more background (what's the story with mr duck anyway?), but neither that, nor the occasionally dull dream foreshadowing sequence (a couple too many there if you ask me) prevents this from being a standout read, especially for (you guessed it) would-be travellers and backpackers. couch potatoes please refrain."
3,gen x neurosis,"Well ho hum. This book was very readable - churned it off in a couple of days. Unfortunately, it wasn't particularly well written and if it wasn't for an interesting adventure concept it would have annoyed me. I mean, how much Gen X selfish dribble does one need? Most of the females initially got described in terms of their breast size and the girl he did like - Francoise- was either cold (at the beginning) or secretly desiring him (mid-end). Not much else was written about her! And as for deceased characters coming back, well, it's a bit hard to take after a while. Ending was quite good though - very Hollywood. Let's see what they do to the film...Leonardo???"
2,Garland Wrote in the Sun Too Long without a Hat,"What a great premise...and what great promise. English hippie drifter and young French couple go to a remote paradise off the coast of Thailand. And then things start to go bad. The problem with The Beach is that it's like a day at a remote tropical beach. It's promising, it's pretty, it's otherworldly, but almost nothing happens. The threat of a violent run-in with Thai gangsters who grow marijuana on the island is briefly realized at the end of the book but Garland could have done much more with this interesting subplot. The characters are a mostly colorless lot. The men and women in The Beach all seem to sleep in the same room on one of the most remote islands in the world yet no sexual activity takes place. This is clearly no paradise by the dashboard lights."
2,A beach paradise without love or sex? No thanks.,"An overpraised book that owes much to Lord of the Flies, which is better written, more concise, and more profound, even after 40 years. Garland throws all his energy into setting up a few good violent scenes (especially the climax), but character isn't his strong point. Also, the beach community that Garland invents is hardly appealing, even at first glance. None of these fun-loving tourists has much fun; they don't even seem to like one another. All they do is smoke dope, play soccer occassionally, and fish. Richard, the main character, doesn't have one romantic interlude throughout the book (a 6-month span). Doesn't anybody have sex in this community? The American pop-culture references, which weigh down each paragraph of the book, in the end become vapid, repetitious, and tiresome. Same with the trippy dream sequences. The book just doesn't have much substance. Maybe the movie will be better."
4,Better Than The Film,"The book The Beach is better than the film version as it is much darker and leaves more to the imagination. The Beach is about a guy called Richard who is travelling around Thailand when he comes across a man who talks about the perfect island. (paradise). Not believing this man Richard goes to sleep and next morning wakes up to find a map stuck to his door and the man who had told him about it had killed himself. Not wanting to go alone Richard asks the french couple from next door to go with him, which they do. Once upon the island everything seems to be going fine until they find out that the island isn't all that it seems. If you have seen th film and didn't like it then give the book a try as it is much better."
2,The Beach is okay: nothing more,"I heard that The Beach was a decent book, comparable to Lord of the Flies. Don't believe it. It's roughly comparable in plot only. While the story is a quick and somewhat entertaining read, the writing just isn't compelling.Garland makes a few relevant comments on society and backpacker culture, but story's construction falls flat, especially at the end (where, in my opinion, the story should have began).If you're looking for some light reading, you'll probably enjoy this book. If you're expecting something more literary, this will disappoint you."
2,Readable but pedestrian,"I really wanted to like this book, and thought the initial setup was great. But after the first 60 or so pages, it's as if the author gets bored of his own text. You can imagine him staring at his wordprocessor around midday, thinking, 'It's such a pain getting Richard and co. from A to B. I'll let them spend a few weeks sitting on their arses smoking dope instead, oh, and they can do some fishing too. That should fill in time until all the blood and guts in the end,' A soothing read, in the way staring at prime time TV is soothing, but the writing style is too flat and clumsy to be considered great literature."
2,A fun read...but a great book? Not hardly!,"I'm completely baffled by the effusive praise this book is getting from readers and critics alike. Is everyone just astonished that a member of the Game-Boy generation can write reasonably coherent prose? It was fine entertainment, but not much more. What was supposed to be so great about the beach anyway? Life there seemed tedious and superficial, so why should anyone care that it came to an end?"
2,"Nice try, but not even close.","This book could have been a decent read; that is if the characters were even half realistic. They all are a group of pleasantly brain dead gen-x'ers who show no emotion at all. Only good part is the scenery. If you are looking for a fast read with a foolish plot and empty characters, try this book."
5,Beach Life,I though The Beach was a great book.It is young fun and just makes you dream of to paradise with them.It also makes you think how people have their perfect idee of paradise and that after it is just what you think that makes it that.I read this book with great interest and it made me think and wonder and it was action full it keep me going until the end.
4,Good Read,"Okay I went to the movie first but after seeing the movie (which despite the critic reviews I thought was brilliant) I had to read the book. The book tied up loose ends as in Richard's mindset when he was in the jungle and the ending was definitely a lot more grisly in the book. I did enjoy the story and found it interesting that it was written by such a a young author and I was completely captivated by Richard's character. Despite being a Brit in the book I think Leonardo di Caprio portrayed him extremely well and Robert Carlyle was brilliant as ever. Shame they could not have expanded his character in the movie as he was a pivotal feature in the book. If you've seen the movie and not read the book I would certainly recommend doing so as it provides an insight into Richard that you may miss. Normally I prefer books to movie versions but in this case, albeit a number of differences, I can say I enjoyed both and believe Danny Boyle did a great job as indeed did Alex Garland."
1,Pointless,"Having just finished ""The Monk"" by Matthew Lewis, a fascinating book, after all the great reviews for The Beach, I must say I am greatly disappointed by this book. The author never trully develops his characters, nor the relationships between them, so as I was reading the story I found myself not really caring about any of them or the beach. Everything is treated in the story on the surface, almost like the author doesn't want to (or doesn't care to) explore personalities or situations. I left The Beach feeling empty, much to my dismay."
4,THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A UTOPIA...,A definite must read for anyone who has used travelling as a means of escape. Alex Garland is a voice of Generation-X.
2,Mixed Confusion,"Well when I first started reading the book, it seemed interesting to me...yet as I kept reading on, there was so many descriptions and adjectives that kept going on endlessly that it just made me bored of reading. There didn't seem to be a good plot...and while reading this book I kept getting confused with all the charaters and the story."
2,"poor, poor Etienne","Does Garland know anything about the French language? Does he even know any French people? Before constructing characters like Etienne (who appears to be as dumb as a rock) or Franoise, he might want to at least learn how to use ""beaucoup"" in a sentence. C'est triste."
2,UHHHH What?,"I was expecting a semi-used book. My book was very old and the binding looks as if it is going to rip any second. I'm afraid to start reading it for that sole reason. The Cover is very cracked as well. I do realize the book is not hard cover and is paperback but the review did not say the damage was so. I was expecting to keep this one in my collection, though I'm seriously considering ordering a different one."
5,The beachy was peachy,"This was one of the best books I have ever read, a real page-turner. The movie however... not the goods. Garland knows his craft and has an excellent eye for detail. This story made me want to travel. Reading is fundamental as Tim Hardaway would say."
2,Quite superficial and simplistic,"It's not as good as other reviewers say. It's far from Robinson Crusoe or Lord of the Flies. It's more like a mass-market beach read. The entire book is quite superficial, the characters are hardly convincing, the plot is so-so, not very credible, especially the ending. It's nice that he gives some travel-style information on Thailand. You cannot really understand what is behind the main characters, which seem pretty random. There are some episodes where the writer tries to show off some ""magical-realism"", but they are pretty pathetic. The book is also unnecessarily violent. Read this book if you have nothing better to do."
4,A fast-paced intelligent piece of literature.,"This book captures the readers attention. It is clever and keeps you wondering what will happen next. The plot thickens with every turn of the page. The character, Richard, is complex and realistic and demonstrates true emotion.I would recommend this book to all college students."
4,"Exciting, creative, and unpredictable!","The Beach is a unique novel that explores an imaginative perspective about Southeast Asia. It captures a glimpse of experiences of the Vietnam War, while portraying cult life on the island known as ""Eden"". I recommend this book to any reader because it relates to all generations."
3,The Beach is an adventure waiting to happen!!,"Do you like adventure, excitement, and unexpected twists and turns? Then you'll love ""The Beach"", it's about a backpacker named Richard who is packbacking through Thailand. A strange man named 'Daffy' talks to Richard about a 'secret beach.' The man leaves Richard a map, showing him where the beach is and how to find it. Richard and his two friends, Etienne and Francoise, start on the adventure of their life. To find out what happens to Richard and his two friends, read this exciting novel, by Alex Garland, and let the adventures begin!"
4,Mating?,This book is quite entertaining but I believe it is owes much to Norman Rush's 'Mating'. Please email if you have read both.
3,Paradise Lost,"I enjoyed reading Alex Garland's tale of the discovery and subsequent loss of a secluded Thai beach paradise. Like in Lord of the Flies, the relationships between the beach dwellers soon deteriorate - cliques form and an atmosphere of pervasive distrust corrodes the initial island idyll until it unravels in death and expulsion from paradise. The writing is clear, even simple in style, but the increasing sense of menace is well captured. This is, however, very much a holiday read, and not for those seeking a degree of depth from the text."
5,The Beach,"l am writing this after having just finished reading 'The beach', prehaps l should have let alittle time pass to get alittle more distance & perspective but l have to tell everyone what a great book it is! The search for the 'traveller' can become the search for a haven. Travellers can leave whenever they like, going from one mess only to create another, walk away from that to another haven to spoil both physically & emotionally. No matter where you go there you are! To anyone who has called themselves 'a traveller', here is the ultimate adventure, l loved it"
4,!,"I thought it was a good book, but in no way comparable to Lord of the Flies, which is my all time favorite. It wasn't as deep, though it was exciting and well written."
4,Almost great,I enjoyed the book very much but every time the action seemed like it was going to pick up it just kind of fizzled out. Alex Garland is a very talented writer but the book never really seems to pick up a good pace. I would still recommend it though.
5,what a masterpiece,"I enjoyed this book to the maximum extent. i read it in about 2 or 3 days. It's one of those books that you have to know what happend next and you cant get yourself to put the thing down. Its kinda like lord of the flies, but not really. i hated that book and love this book.The Beach is very fast paced and adventurous..very good for a traveler....my whole life i have wanted to venture to thailand..that is one reason i read this book. i think whoever is reading this should read that book..go for it kiddos."
4,The Beach,"This book appealed to me on two levels: as a reader, and as a traveler. The premise sucked me in right away: a longing for the ultimate vacation spot, the ultimate beach. And before I knew it I was addicted to and facinated by it. It was like nothing I had read before, and this too appealed to me. The main character's manic trains of thought and the author's vivid style of writing were what kept me addicted. I highly recommend this book to anyone unhappily suck in an Oprah's book club rut. It is one of the freshest books I've read in the last few years."
2,May you never find what you are looking for,"The beginning of the novel is exciting. Describing the backpacker scene in Bangkok, and the death of the mysterious traveler with his story of a legendary Beach, untouched by human hands, that everyone is looking for. This searching for a Shangri La in exotic surroundings describes the state of mind of the young long distance backpacker very well, where Shangri La or the Beach can be a symbol for a lot of things. Once the Beach is found though it turns out to be a dissapointment. It's the searching for the unknown that was fun. The Beach turns out to be populated by your average collection of travelers you meet on the road. And after an initial spell of the ecxitement caused by the meeting of like-minded people, they turn out to be rather irritating and pretty boring. This is exactly what happens with the novel too. There isn't a lot to do on the Beach either. Reader, may you never find what you are looking for!"
3,The beginning shows promise but the ending is muddled,"The Beach is the perfect book to read if you are backpacking in Asia which is exactly what I was doing when I picked this novel up. The dialogue is sharp and the novel is impressive in its intensity and in its commentary on the pursuit of the exotic. This young, first time novelist has captured much of the controversy that exists in Asian tourism. Many westerners long for and, in some cases, expect the true untouched ""exotic"" when they travel to Asia. Of course, the irony lies in the fact that once they discover the ""exotic"" it is no longer truly undiscovered and hence it loses some of its allure. The weaknesses of this novel include a disjointed ending and a tendency to borrow plots from other books such as the classic island suspense novel, Lord of the Flies. Richard, however, is an engaging character as are his friends in the island community."
4,A Quasi-Classic for Gen-Xers,"True, this book is slightly overrated. Yes, the parallels to Lord of the Flies, Heart of Darkness, Animal Farm, On the Road, and Treasure Island are somewhat overdone. However, this may be the best novel to come out of Generation X thus far. It is rare to find a true page-turner that does not fall into the monstrous pile of best-selling trash that crowds the shelves of your local bookstore. This is a story about human interaction, disillusionment, and finally, the nature of mankind. At the same time it is a subtle commentary on modern society and how we are influenced by our surroundings (some may squawk at the use of pop-culture references, but these references are in the book for a reason). In the end, what separates this debut novel from many of the classics is style. Garland may not yet be the master of prose that Golding and Conrad were, but give him time. Definately a recommended read."
3,Second-rate LORD OF THE FLIES,"Don't misunderstand me - you cannot put this book down. Garland masterfully maintains the suspense from the first page to the last. However, the literate subtlety and depth of William Golding's ""Lord of the Flies"" is missing - thus the vague feeling of dissatisfaction when the book ends. Some of the problems are card-board characters, and sledge-hammer symbolism borrowed from Hollywood and video games. However, if you have a day or two to kill (preferrably on a lonely beach somewhere), then this book is a MUST READ!"
4,Excellent stuff,A fascinating story of how seculsion and idyllic surroundings can never prevent the human instinct for self destruction. The only criticism I would have is the infuriatingly short chapters which seem to punctuate the book needlessly.A must read for anyone visiting Asia looking for adventure.
2,Highly Overrated.,"This book is WAY overrated. Kerouac it is not. Not even close. There is no character development and no real tension, which makes the book quite boring. Its saving grace, however, is that it moves very quickly. This is definately amateurish literature for a TV generation."
4,better than most modern fiction.,"Let me just start by saying that I loved the book. It was the fastest well written book that I have read. I hear some people claiming that there was a lack of character development. Personally, I feel that these readers are too dependant on the heavy-handed writing style that is so dominant these days. One can tell a lot about a person by what video games he plays. Or I could be dead wrong. Maybe the book was terrible and I just miss Thailand."
4,"A vivid, powerful and fast-moving Thai adventure!","This is a great read... a powerful and disturbing adventure. The story follows a young backpacker Richard in a fascinating fast-paced trip to the hidden Thai island, Ko Samui, where the seemingly perfect community quickly turns scary and dangerous.The end is different to the filmThe Beach(which I watched first) but I dont think I have a preference. Both endings are equally vivid and cleverly thought out."
5,Excellent,"One of the better books I have read. Alex captures the great human struggle of the garden of eden ... we all search for paradise, nirvana, eden and just when we think we have found it, we discover that it can become hell and expulsion is bitter but necessary."
5,hours of enjoyment,Today I finished listening to The Beach on tape after several days of commuting an hour each way to and from work. I hardly remember the miles I was so swept up in this well-told story. It's definitely a tape/page-turner. Made me almost look forward to going to work just so I could hear another hour!
2,"I, too, was born in 1974...","So what?Any book that is touted to be the first great novel of any generation is bound to be disappointing. Personally I'm insulted by these authors with such large egos that they think they can even begin to sum up a generation, and then dump all over us all and portray us as a bunch of lazy, good-for-nothing, pot-smoking morons.Poor plot development, zero character development, juvenile style (it brought to mind a book called ""The Grounding of Group Six"" -- one I enjoyed when I was about thirteen), too many loose ends, anticlimactic, unoriginal... what more can I say? If you're looking for a book to take to the beach this summer, this would suffice. If you're looking for literature, read ""Lord of the Flies."""
1,Tried to like,"I read the reviews of the hardcover version & couldn't wait for the paperback version to come out. Maybe, because I am not a gen x, but I didn't get the story, didn't move fast for me. The only lesson I took away from the book, was be careful what you wish for."
4,2/3 of a Great Book,"I enjoyed the first 2/3 of this book very much. I enjoyed its realistic view of backpackers in Asia. If you have travelled there, you have seen them. Always looking for the more hardcore place. China, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia...always trying to out do the other. I found the book very entertaining until the last 70 or so pages. The climax or lack there of was a let down. The tension built and built but never reached its potential. A good book with a poor ending. I am curious to see the movie version."
3,This novel was so so.,"As a international student, I read this novel to acquire more vocabulary . It was intresting and relatively easy to read. The writer described the X generation well, however, I felt unpleasant that there were cruel expressions. It was too much for me. I could understand the theme of this novel, describing human nature, but I disagree the sense of value in this novel. It seemed that the writer agreed with euthanasia and drug abuse. During reading this novel, I felt somber and cold."
1,Over rated and an insult to intelligent readers,"The premise of the book is ok, but I found the self-involvement of the characters very boring. As one reviewer said, it's true that many backpackers are only interested in meeting other Westerners, not learning about the country they are supposedly traveling in. Reading the reviews by other readers makes me wonder what kind of lives they lead when they express admiration for the repellent characters. ( Or those who say they thought about the book at work...what kind of jobs do they have? )"
1,"Shallow characters, shallow plot, set in shallow water.","If you can't think of anything for your characters to do, have them smoke some more dope. That seems to be the most distinguishing feature of Garland's writing style in this lame tale about a bunch of uninteresting, shallow-minded, self-absorbed drifters who end up in their idea of paradise...a beach stocked with its own marijuana plantation and a Gameboy. None of Garland's characters evokes any sense of empathy, rather, they evoke a dull sense of disgust combined with a desire for the Thai authorities to find these people as quickly as possible and lock them away where they will never be heard from again.To compare this piece of...fiction with Lord of the Flies is an insult to the artistry of William Golding."
5,Paradise Totally Lost,"This book is so much better than the movie that I don't think they should share the same name. I loved the beginning down on kaosan road in Bangkok and then the whole trip down the islands and this sense of kids looking for paradise, the perfect beach, and instead finding a version fo hell. This is an important book about an era and time that is rapidly going away. For example, by now, the internet and e-mail has so changed travelling and the whole rave scene that any spot that's half-fine will be totally out on the web before you've set down your beach towel. Still, it was fun while it lasted."
5,Wow!!,"I just finished this book, after being motivated to do so by the movie. A GREAT movie, and an awesome book. The writing style is nothing short of facinating. I enjoy the format. It will make you think, just like the movie did. FIVE STARS!!!"
3,lost in the wilderness of one's own mind,"Given the hype this book has recieved, I expected a magical mystery tour, but instead I found myself with a novel that sputters it's way through an uneven tirade of sex, drugs, murder, and eventual insanity. It tries and fails to portray the ""supposed"" enligtenment of one character, aka, the rest of us, ""Generation X"", in a prettily wrapped package! Don't buy the hype! Garland started his novel with a level of extreme potential, but leaves the reader puzzled as to the ultimate point of this novel's journey. If you're into the sprituality and duality of human character-buy it. If you are into a good book to read that doesn't make those of us in our 20's look lost-then don't bother."
5,The Action Never Stops,"I had heard that this book was full of suspense and nonstop events. Once I picked it up, it just could not be put down. Seriously one of the best books I have read. Alex Garland makes it seem as if he really did experience this. To every last detail I still think it happend. I had also heard that the ending was crazy (which it is!)and that it wasnt in the movie.(Which i still have to see) Overall, it was a great read. For anyone who loves good (I mean really really good) books, this is it."
4,Is there such a thing as a perfect place?,"This is the perfect book for those of us constantly searching for a better place, a better life. In this novel, this utopia consists of a secluded beach off the beaten tourist path of Thailand. Backpackers from different parts of the world assemble here and form their own distinct society, away from the pressures of every-day modern society. Except that in Garland's novel, this perfect world soon comes crashing down and dissolves into a tale of madness, revenge and drug addiction.Garland's use of first-person narrative is very engaging and he has a writing style that makes for fast and easy reading. The Beach is a great ride, especially for backpackers, travellers and free spirits."
3,Flawed. <Spoilers>,"I found this book to be interesting, although not compelling. The character development needs a lot of work here. Worse for me, however, were the final scenes. Throughout the entire book, I was hoping above all hopes that the ending wouldn't fall back on the use of the derivative ""everyone goes stark-raving mad and pounces on Richard"" cliche. But disappointingly, that is exactly what Garland did, which I think is a predictable mistake for a novice author. If Garland were more creative and experienced, he could have written a truly unique novel."
2,It read like a TV show. . .,"I don't know that I would recommend this book to anyone, although there were some characteristics of this book that I really liked. I agree that most of the characters (except Richard) are very superficial, but the development of tension between all the different people was VERY good. That really is what kept me reading the book.Other than that, though, I didn't really enjoy it. It felt to me like a poorly-written version of ""Lord of the Flies,"" but written like a TV show. At the end, because of the fractured images and choppy sentences, I felt like the author merely got bored with writing and wanted to stop. This also made it difficult to follow the action.Overall, I'd say don't bother with this book. Read ""Lord of the Flies"" instead - it's much better."
2,Beached,"This book was the hyped book of the season, and it simply didn't deliver. Amid hipster pop culture references, this book follows a very well-travelled thematic path, ending up as a Gen-X ""Lord of the Flies"", which itself dealt with tired themes. This is a ""shocking book"" for the easily shocked."
2,Simply acceptable nothing more maybe less,Garland's book is easy to read but not that interesting. The story is simple. The characters are shallow. But the action is at least at the edge of being entertaining. So the book is acceptable to spend your time if you are realy bored.
2,An interesting but too long written novel,I read the book in my English lesson at school but it took a long time for me to finish the novel. In my opinion the first 100 pages of the beach were interesting and easy to read. But after this part it becomes boring. The describtion of the several problems in the community are written to long but the different characters trades are described too superficial so it was very hard for me to understand the relations between the Beachers.
2,Too many questions and no answers!!,"I read this book for the school and it took me a long time to get through it. Not because it was difficult to read, but there was no real tension in the book. Furthermore I would have liked to know more about several characters of the book: - Which motivation did they personally have to go to the beach? - How did they live before they came to the beach? - What did they feel in the community? The only thing in the novel I really liked was how Richard's two personalities are described through Mr. Duck. So I give the book one star for the description of Richard and one star for the description of how the community develops itself."
1,disappointing,"This book starts off well, but the last few chapters i had to force myself to read. I had to laugh when the 'mob' turned against him and started stabbing him ...a poor rip off of 'Lord of the Flies'."
1,Why waste your time?,"Remember when you were in school and required to read all those old tomes the adults called literature? But you opted, instead, for Cliff Notes and the like. You cheated, and now you must pay! Now, your 'just deserts' come in the form of books but not in their substance. And you get attempts like ""The Beach"". Just what you deserve. Life is too short to waste your alloted reading time on such drivel. Don't read this book. Read the classics, finally, and biography to learn about yourself and the world. Then go out in the world with that knowledge to effect yourself. Don't just sit around and watch. This book is like a drug that dulls the senses instead of perfecting them. Don't spend your intellectual life in a literary stupor."
1,"A Cliff's Notes version of ""Lord of the Flies.""","It's a book version ofa computer game--one dimensional characters, emotional distance from the action, and--don't worry--all the violence is ""cartoon violence"" so nobody really gets hurt. An unimaginative, lowbrow book disguised as a middlebrow book. The worst insult I can find: It deserves to be made into a movie."
1,"""The Beach"" should go out with the tide","This book is a bore. It starts out with great promise but quickly gets bogged down in a useless and weak plot. The ending is a great disappointment -- it's almost like the publisher called up and told Mr. Garland he had one day to finish the book. Frankly, Mr. Garland writes like the very young author he is. Don't waste your money on the book, or the movie."
1,The Beach,"I found this book really boring. The storyline is nothing much. The main character irritates me because I feel that the author tries so hard to create him to be 'cool' which in real life would turn out to be a really sad man if he really has that kind of personality. The story drags on and makes big deals about unimportant things. I think many people like this book because of the 'Paradise Island' which the author has described in the book - no work, free food, free dope, swimming all day, party all night etc. That's about it."
3,"Ok, but not as good as I hoped.","I bought this to read while in Thailand. I was staying on the beach in Chawaeng, thinking this'd be a great read. The best I can say is that it's an ok holiday read. It seems to take itself a little too seriously - like it's trying to become great literature, but needs just a little more. The dramatic point comes a little too late and is too obvious in coming - so the tension doesn't build as it should. Also, it seems like there was a storyline that got dropped entirely - there was a whole bunch of foreshadowing, but nothing ever came of it. I guess this might have been the authors attempt at a ""twist"", but it came off feeling more like ""oops, forgot that one"" :(Ah well - it's still worth reading once and provided an interesting fictional context to where I was staying. I never got out to the lagoon cos it was raining and high swell - yep, it exists and yep, you can go there on the tour.Maybe next time will be better. ;)"
1,Pretentious and mediocre,"Garland may be young, and this may be a first novel, but even making for allowances it is impossible to see why this book has been so heavily and expensively hyped. There are some good moments, and some well-drawn characters, especially early on, but as the book goes on (and, boy does it go on...) it loses it's way so badly, and reverts to so many tired and predictable devices, that all reading pleasure is simply gone. And, worst of all, this book lectures and self-loves to a very irritating degree."
5,Enthralling,"I couldn't get enough of this book and had a very hard time taking breaks from reading it. I couldn't wait to get to the conclusion, but also didn't want it to end. The plot, the flow of the storyline, the characters, and especially the setting - all fascinating. Start this book, and you'll have to finish it. Don't bother seeing the movie, it is very different from the book and very poorly done."
2,"New waves, same old beach","The upshot of this Gen-X reworking of ""The Lord of the Flies"" and ""The Mosquito Coast"" is that civilization is good for you so don't even THINK of trying to escape, because you'll only end up in the madness and despair that is the true legacy of human nature and the human heart. And since that's the case, don't bother about politics, either, because you'll just wind up in the same state. Thanks, Margaret Thatcher in drag. This thickly plotted (and therefore contrived) adventure story had a built-in audience among the backpacker set but really has nothing to say. Mild entertainment value."
1,How can I say this nicely...,"It s-u-c-k-s, but is fabulous if your into superficial plots, guts and vomit. I give it 5 stars in shock fiction, sensationalism and anything to sell books mentality.Oh, and did you know that Alex ""how else can I mis respresent Gen. X"" Garland did not even visit Thailand before he wrote this book, dispite what he has repeated in many interviews.Its a throw together, boring, sickening, childish piece of hack, and its a testement to the generation, to which I belong, that it was such a hit. It's fame to me is something akin to pompous people who expound endless metephors to look like they know art, when all they are looking at is a urinal... get it?So, if you feel like wasting money, reading about people pooing on themselves and wait 235 pages for a plot to develop... go for it.Don't say I didn't warn you:)"
4,Took way too long,"The book is in great condition. However, when I ordered the book they promised two to three business days and it took almost two weeks. I needed this book for school and if I had known it was going to tak this long I would have gone to the bookstore."
2,Oh please,"Not only is this book poorly written with overly simplistic characters and an amazingly stupid ending, it's also completely implausible.Suspending disbelief is one thing, but this takes it too far. We're supposed to buy that a bunch of 20-somethings are incredibly happy--in a glassy-eyed, cultish sort of way-- to stay on an island for years, accept assigned manual labor every day, live on fish and have no access to even the most basic supplies such as a pair of glasses or a tampon.The plot never seems to build logically, instead it careens along in a directionless way until the last 50 pages when, out of the clear blue sky, all hell breaks loose. I literally put the book down and said, ""What?"" outloud.Sadly, the first half of this novel shows glimmers of talent and style which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. But then it seems like Gardland wrote himself into a corner, and rather than fix the problem, he opted to explode the whole room."
3,standing on the beach,"I'll have to start this review by telling you that I didn't finish the book. It was not because it was boring, but because it glorified violence unduly, a shortcoming that I find intolerable. I picked up the book expecting a lot more commentary on the treatment of the third world as a Disney park, a characteristic of my generation. This was not addressed as significantly as I had hoped. When I read the book the movie had already premiered and I couldn't shake from my mind the chain of action as a short attention span gratifying made for movie novel. I mean, I know that it wasn't, but the transfer seemed that it would be all too easy. My friend, Scott, who loves the book brought up a good point. The book is written in the first person, Richard, who is a selfish and dim witted jerk. It is interesting to walk in these shoes, although my wife moaned with frustration as the primary character bumbles through a chain of really bad decisions."
3,The Beach is a sure trhill for all ages,"This is a powerful, rich novel that assembles the nature of human animals in such a force that the reader feels pull in every aspect of the story. It analyzes the egotistical view of males's perspective, in a way you can't but help admiring it."
3,Entertaining but loses its way.,"I agree the book does begin well and very quickly draws you into the story. I have some experience in the kind of travelling described particularly in Thailand, so I desperately wanted to like this book. The concept itself worked but I believe Garland struggled with a suitable ending for the tale. I have to disagree with a previous reviewer who reccomended ""Are You Experienced"" a thoroughly unlikable book with no redeming features I can remember."
4,"Great Book, lame ending, movie?","I wanted to read The Beach before the movie came out, and I'm afraid I'll be very dissapointed in the film version. This book was a quick read simply becasue I could not put it down until I had finished it. I like the fact thinking about family made Richard sad. It made me wonder what everyone else on the beach had left behind. My only problem with the book is how quickly everything wrapped up in the end, when all sorts of things had gone wrong."
3,Great Buildup-Poor Finish,My title says it all. The author starts out with a fascinating premise and I was enthralled by the events in the middle but the ending a total ho-hum event.
4,Life's A Beach,"This is Richard's story. He's an English backpacker who lands in Thailand and can't resist an adventure into the unknown. He finds one on offer at a Bangkok hostel, where he meets Daffy, an emaciated, pot smoking mad Scotsman who gives Richard a map to a secret island community - The Beach. He heads for the island with a beautiful young French couple, Etienne and Francoise, and they find a secret community that's very different indeed. The Beach is a fast-paced adventure story which examines how, no matter where we go, we cannot escape the ideologies our culture has ingrained in us. The narrative moves along at breakneck speed as Richard takes you into 'beachlife'. With his guidance, you'll grow to love some of the characters and hate others from the outset. I found this to be a really enjoyable read and couldn't put it down."
3,Standard Stuff,"Copyright 2005, so it is badly out of date. Not much here for the beginner who just wants to solve the problems that will get him up and running. For example, the index has no entry for 'audio' or 'sound' or 'video' or 'print' or 'printing', but plenty of information if you want to get up to your elbows in package management from the command line. It is the functional equivalent to another book, ""Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 Bible"" by Hill, Harris, and Vyas, which is also too old and too advanced to be useful to a beginner."
2,concepts and techniques,"I expected much better quality for the price, when the book arrived the last 25 pages or so were not even glued into the binding. Poor workmanship"
4,Nice player.,"I did a lot of research before buying the iAudio G3. It's a nice player.Pros:Great soundEasy to operatePlenty of featuresAdequate storage capacity (1GB)Long battery life (runs on one AA battery)Bookmark feature is handy for audio books and personal development programsCons:Earbuds are large and uncomfortableNo belt clip caseNeck strap is heavy and has a couple of clunky metal piecesHaving said that, the G3 is a quality product and I highly recommend it."
2,"Finally, Great Sound,Features,and Battery Life","I hope my decision process will help others in the search for a great MP3 player. After reading reviews on various players for several weeks, I decided on a Shiro flash player that could be expanded with SD cards and used AAA batteries.Easy to use and had good sound, but the 10 hour(or less)battery life and no resume capability became annoying.Then I tried the Samsung Yepp.Seemed sturdy and had good battery ratings, but sound quality much less than my previous player and forget recording quality. I then ordered both the IAudio G3 and I5 from Amazon. Both had great sound and similar features. I thought the G3 had superior voice recording quality,easier navigation of features, and buttons seemed sturdier than the I5's rocker switches. I kept the G3 and am very happy. The only improvement I could think of would be if it could accept SD cards."
1,BE VERY WARY,"bought the g3,it worked fine with my mac.It lasted a week then got stuck on shuffle which was very irritating. Then it started to go very strange. The screen would mess up. It would stop on its own.Sometimes wouldnt boot up. THEN wasnt recongnised on the computer and within 3 weeks of buying it had stopped functioning totally.now it will not start up.I have been e-mailing cowon constantly for 7 weeks trying to get support and an address to send it to to be fixed but no.one will accept responsability.it was the first thing i have bought of the internet and i will not buy electronics off it again.I travel a lot and i dont need this trouble.If anyone from cowon reads this please dont hesitate to step forward and fix my player with the 1year warrenty i am supposed to have."
5,Great mp3 player,I have had the G3 for about 2 months now and am very happy with this product. It has lived up to all expectations.
1,Purchasing This Product Amounts To Playing Russian Roulette,"I've owned this product for 6 months and I wish I had never bought it because the purchase amounts to gambling. If nothing goes wrong then you will be happy with the purchase, but if you have the slightest problem-game over you lose. The entire problem revolves around customer support which is based on the philosophy of, `if we ignore and intentionally frustrate the customer then the problem will go away.'Their right, I have gone away and will never return as a customer.For consumers, why gamble on a product when you can get a for sure product somewhere else?"
4,Music Player,"This unit has excellent sound. Excellent battery life. Amazon incorrectly states it has an AC adapter. Unit is not designed for AC use. Can draw power from your PC USB port, however.I wanted to record radio programs more than listen to music. This unit is great for music lovers, but radio lovers will not like the recording options. The FM sound is excellent for live listening. I returned the unit and bought a POGO AM/FM Recorder which is perfect for recording those long night-time talk shows. It costs $75-80 more, but the features make it worth the extra money..."
5,My Favorite Band...,"Thank you Five Eight for making another excellent rock album. Raw energy and beautiful lyrics is what makes this album so incredible. I have listened to their other stuff, but I cannot stop listening to this CD. My favorite song on the disc is A Man Is A Pent Up Thing. Originally released on The Angriest Man CD, this song grabs me everytime I hear it. Mike sings, ""I've got to love someone some way, I got to make it some someday, It's in my blood, When I write the greatest song, Well you know I still won't belong..."" One of the most powerful songs I have ever heard. Go out and buy this now."
3,Ehh,"Has to much writing in it, like the whole book was done for me. Not happy :/ Might as well bought it new."
3,Starts off with a bang - ends with a wimper,"I had to put my bits in to complement all the great reviews. Gibilisco indeed does a fantastic job introducing all of the basic concepts of electricity and electronics. The first two parts (550+ pages) are exemplary in their treatment of electronic components. I finally understood how to analyze an LRC circuit!!The second two parts, however, are not nearly as helpful. Perhaps it's because the topics become too complex for the simple presentations use in the first half, but I found the sections on Basic and Advanced Electronics (the last 250+ pages) to be little more than a cursory overview of various components and uses. Good as a very basic introduction, but little practical value.Overall, I enjoyed reading the book and learned a great deal from the first half. The second parts were interesting but less useful."
5,A Very Fine Textbook,"The book starts simply enough to be of use to beginners and grows complex enough to help professionals who need a review, such as myself. The tests are great for highlighting what you need to know."
2,doesn't explain much,"This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. When I first got it I was slightly disturbed because I thought I recieved the wrong book. Then it asks you questions about things you haven't covered yet. Things like the first chapter explains about atoms, protons, neutrons, atomic numbers, and isotopes. In the chapter review it ask many questions about resistors, solar cells, and conductors. Don't but this book!"
4,Learned a shocking amount,"I used this book to learn basic electronics so I could pass an employment test for an open position at my work. I combined this book with a college textbook to learn what I needed to know. This book successfully compresses all the major ideas of electronics into tidy chapters. I found this book easy to read and learn concepts from. However, it fell short on circuit analysis, so I turned to my textbook for that."
2,Not so good,"The book itself goes into many subjects relating to electronics. Unfortunately, the subject matter is too brief and vague. Some of the material is enough to get a clear understanding but most is not sufficient to teach oneself without the help of a tutor or instructor. Since this is a teach yourself book I find it inadaquet."
2,Could be better!,"I should first admit that I have only read the first 1/4 of the book. My first problem with the book is that it uses symbols for resistors, that look like two s's, but nowhere provides a key for this symbol. I turned to the internet and was still unsuccessful in finding a definition of the symbol. I think that book is mediocre in its exposition. I found websites that explained the basic topics better. Overall, I don't know if I can recommend the book."
4,Seventies Kids Stuff,"This dvd is entertaining, I enjoy the dated nature of it. Oscar Goldman,(Jamie Somers' boss) with the detectable toupee, acts like a jerk. The special effects and action are often silly, and the characters (apart from Wagner's) regularly approach caricature.The overall effect is comedic.The series is valuable as a document of mid-seventies popular culture, and Lindsay Wagner is charming to watch."
4,Great Bang for Bucks..,"Given the price of this watch it would be hard to do better without spending a lot more.The detail of the watch is good as is the finish and quality of the materials used (again given the price). I own watches of various different styles, sizes, materials, mechanisms etc and this fits in nicely without being embarrassed.Would recommend Stuhrling watches and would easily buy again. At the dollars you need to spend on these watches anyone can have a collection of different watches that will likely surprise all but genuine aficionados."
2,Gains seconds,"It is actually a nice looking watch. However, I returned it as it gained about 30 seconds per day. I am not sure if this is usual for the Stuehrling watches, but non-certified automatic watches should not gainer lose more than 5 seconds per day. I was not a big fan of the clasp as it was not very comfortable to wear. The original price seems to be a so called ""moon price"". All watches are on sale and it seems that this is part of Stuehling's/Amazon's marketing strategy. Only two stars from me as just the design is not enough for a watch, it should keep the time..."
3,"Stylish, but runs fast","The watch is stylish and striking. However, the watch runs fast. In fact, I returned the first watch because it gained a couple of minutes a day. The replacement watch did as well, but not as fast. I contacted Stuhrling Original and they offered that my reported ""time-gain"" fell within their tolerances (i.e. they know it runs fast).So, if you can tolerate a fast watch and have no issue adjusting the time every couple of days, I can recommend purchasing the watch. Just understand what you are getting."
3,small!,"There were no dimensions listed only weight. It is matchbox car size, in semi-trailer form. It looks well made, but I was looking for something bigger."
2,"Good, not great - 2.5 stars","This romance novel started out well enough. The beginning chapters of this novel, up to the hero, Gabriel's, escape from slavery on Maria's family plantation, are the best part. When Maria becomes Gabriel's ""slave"" in turn, it's so silly. For one, Gabriel keeps feeling guilty for making her work, AND keeps taking the work out of her hands, preferably so he can get her into bed. He also has these intrusive servants who keep poking their noses into his business with Maria, too. Maria just became a little sappy as the book went on. The romance between the two of them is just strong enough to keep you reading, but I really prefered Busbee's ""The Tiger Lily"" over this book."
2,Interminable,"The book started out pretty well and it looked like it had a good story going. Boy was I wrong!I could not find any sympathy for Maria who seemed to be delibrately courting the hero's wrath all the time. Didn't really buy that she loved him when she was being rude and hurtful any chance she got. She seemed so immature for most of the book, that I really did not feel for her predicament at any point. When she knew what her brother had done, why she continued to blindly support him was baffling to me. Her foolish and false pride was very off-putting. For the most part I just wanted Gabriel to give her the boot and find somebody else. Not that he was a saint or anything, but everytime he made some sort of overture she would go and spoil it by her delibrate rudeness and it was getting on my nerves. This book should have been way way short. I skipped most of it just so I could finish. Two and half stars."
4,love these mounts,"Been using another mount for years - that brand could be associated with indians. This one is equivalent to the other brand's premium mounts - very solid, very easy and accurate adjustment with the built-in vernier screws. Plus they're made in the USA, and cheaper than the others."
3,"Great flush-ceiling mount, Awful if extension column needed","5 stars for a flush-ceiling mount application. Easily connected to Panasonic PT-AE7000U. Very well built, sturdy, lots of fine adjustment options but didn't come with lag bolts for ceiling anchorage1 star if an extension column is needed. Bought a 12"" Chief extension column and tried 3 different columns and none would thread to the manufacturer's recommended 4 threads. Problem were the threads that were cut out for the locking hex bolt wouldn't allow the column past these threads in either the RPA-U mount or ceiling plate.Thought it may be user error but employee at Home Depot found the threads to be poorly cut also. So great product if it's a flush-ceiling mount and the extension column isn't needed, and until Chief fixes the thread problem, a frustrating and unsuccessful mount if an extension column is needed. BTW went with a Peerless PPA mount."
5,Fantastic Projector Mount,This mount is great. The included arms for attachment to the projector were easy to attach and very solid. The mount intself is very solid and well made. I did feel I needed to reinforce the ceiling where I placed the mount but the projector I was mounting was actually larger than my previous projector and I was concerned about the additional wt. The mount allows appropriate adjustment and holds position extremely well. I chose this mount because of Chief's reputation and the recommendation of the tech support technician I spoke with at SIM2. You will be very satisfied if you use this mount.
5,Used with Panasonic AE3000U,"Mounting the AE3000U was a little tricky at first. The trouble is that if the mounting holes of the projector are too close together, the four adjustable legs can get in the way of each other, making them hard to position. (Would have been nice if the kit also included two extra short legs instead of only the four long ones.) The trick is to set the feet to the maximum height to get better clearance. Anyway, it works great and it looks like it will work for just about any projector. I went with this brand since I already had a custom (not universal) RPA mount installed for an older projector. So when I got the new projector, I only had to replace the interface plate instead of the whole mount."

5,Wonderful book,This book is absolutely great. The double wedding ring pattern is the prettiest I'd ever seen. I'm working on my 2nd one. This is amoung my most prized quilt books.
5,"If you don't like using templates, this isn't the book for you","If you love 1930s quilts, you'll want this book. Beautiful pictures and instructions for making: Double Wedding Ring, Dresden Plate, Grandmother's Flower Garden, Hearts and Gizzards, Lone Star, Pinwheel, Square in a Square, Sunbonnet Sue, Sunflower, and 20 others.While there's a pretty good General Instructions section, if you've never made a quilt, don't depend on this book for detailed how-to information."
5,Baby music for the Crib,"It is a great product and so nice to be able to choose all the songs that I feel are soothing and comforting. I had a wonderful time gathering songs for the baby and will change them as he grows. The icrib has great sound and is so easy to use. It attached to the crib with no problems, Compared to the CD player that I used for my other grandson it is a big step up."
5,Love it!,"You can download your own music into an mp3 player or an ipod. Great sounding speakers, latches onto crib."
3,"Nice, but some problems","The iCrib is a good idea, but I agree with others that the lack of an AC power source is a big drawback. When the batteries run down, the unit emits a loud buzzing sound -- not good for a sleeping baby! I thought it might be just the one I had and got a replacement, but the second one did the same thing. I don't really use the light feature. Even with the problems, I still use it every night and it seems to help put my little one to sleep."
3,Great product. One glitch...,"I love this product but have one complaint that no one seems to mention in their reviews. The concept of a timer (15/30/60 minutes) is great. However, the machine turns off but fails to shut down the iPod causing it to continue to run long after the sound machine has shut off. I have to remember to sneak into my son's dark room, find the correct button on my iPod (by feel, which is difficult with a practically buttonless iPod). Thus, due to the extended 'play' time, I am having to constantly recharge my iPod lasts only about 2 uses. Poor design. Automatic shut off should shut off iPod unit too, to preserve charge-life! Other than that, GREAT product. Sound is good, volume adjustment is perfectly fine."
4,Nice sound system for babies!,"This is a great concept for music for babies. I wish the Creative Zen worked with it, but it works with the iPod. Also, it would be nice if the volume could be adjusted higher."
5,More than expected,"I bought this iCrib to replace an older crib system that broke (not Munchkin). I also wanted something more ""big boyish"" since my son will be two shortly.The product is well made, with wonderful planning on how the iPod (any generation) fits securely into the back. It has an option to have a nightlight on with the music, which my son finds quite amusing.5 stars for the iCrib. Munchkin continues to impress me on their quality, yet fairly inexpensive, items."
1,"Decent music, horrible reissue - caveat emptor!","Kitty Well's original 1962 Decca Christmas album is not her finest moment, though true fans (such as I) will enjoy it. My point, however, is to point out that this CD reissue on the Eclipse label is just awful - a genuine disservice to the Queen of Country Music. Mainly,1) it is poorly mastered from scratchy vinyl2) it contains just 9 of 12 songs from the original LP3) it does not have the original cover art or any appreciable annotation.MCA, who own the Decca masters, really should do the job right. Until then, buyer beware."
4,I'm confused...,"So why does a recording of Burton reading Dylan Thomas have a picture of Burton's Hamlet on the cover? In truth, Burton was a wonderful advocate of Thomas's poerty. But in the end, even Burton cannot surpass the marvelous voice of Thomas himself. Still, in all, this recording is a fine reminder of Burton's art."
5,Great Biblical Teaching,"Finally, a book that teaches the serious Christian how to pray effectively. Ever wonder why your prayers aren't answered the way you want them to be? Well, this book tells you why and shows you how to correct your prayers so that you will have an effective prayer life. I wish I had had this book 10 years ago. If you really want to pray with power put aside all you ""think"" you have learned so far about prayer and start over with this great book. If you are willing and you are ready to hear what God says about prayer instead of listening to what most Christian leaders are telling us this book is for you. Only serious, committed Christians should get this book. It is a must read."
5,Guaranteed to revolutionize your prayer life!!,This is certainly not your typical book on prayer. It is full of powerful truths that have been hidden from the Body of Christ for centuries. One thing that has held Christians back is the fact that they never really learned how to pray. This book will change your prayer life forever! I recommend it to every believer!
4,Releasing the Ability of God,"Charles Capps books are always a good read. Anyone desiring to improve themselvesspiritually will enjoy reading this book. I don't know why he used the word Ability in connection withGod, but I am not a theologian . It does put God on a personal level , more approachable. Thisbook gave me the desire to look up Charles Capps TV & Radio Ministry even tho I am a Catholic.A person can always expand on a spiritual level."
5,Want to unleash God's power in your life? Read this Book!,"WoW!! This book is excellent and right on! Charles Capps does an excellent job rightly dividing the word of truth and opening up the power of God's word. I can say with utmost confidence that this book has made a significant difference in my life. I am so thankful for the understanding that God provides so we can ""have life and have it more abundantly..."". God makes sure his word moves and thank you to Charles Capps for being an instrument of God! If you are ready to start walking with God's authority in your life as God intended us to ... then this book is a must read..."
2,Twist God's Arm? - I don't think so!,"This is a very interesting book. A red flag went up as I a read it. Searching the scriptures, I found that Capps takes his verses out of context. He does bring up a couple of good faith principles but that is it. This is a very ""name and claim it"" book. I don't believe in twsiting God's arm to get what I desire.Capps bascially states you DO NOT pray for God's will. If you do - then your faith is null and void. He also states that - and I quote - ""Jesus taught us to pray to the Father in the name of Jesus. We have authority to use His name BUT WE ARE NOT TO PRAY TO JESUS. "" This statement completely nullfies our right as children of God and goes against many teachings in the Bible.I would caution any new or young Christian not to read this book. His teachings are off and his ""name and claim"" ministry is dangerous. I didn't resell my copy of Capp's book - I trashed it."

5,This cup was a godsend -- wish it were easier to find,"Our daughter started out in life with a suck/swallow problem, severe acid reflux, and later failure to thrive b/c she struggled so much with bottle feedings. We finally got her to take her bottles, but as it came time to switch to sippy cups, the nightmare went on and on -- we tried about 20 different kinds of straw and sippy cups. What she kept gravitating to were her big brother's 10oz cupsicles, so when I saw these 8 oz cupsicles with handles while on a trip, I snapped up 3 praying they would work. She LOVES them -- the only problem is I'd like to have a few more and I can't find them anywhere. The handles take up a lot of space, so they don't fit well in her cooler bag, but the fact that she'll suck down her drinks in them is worth their weight in gold to me, no matter how I have to carry them. We've been happy with the big kid cupsicles for over a year, so I am sure we'll be happy with these long term as well."
1,Terrible cup,"First, the cap that hides away the straw is so hard to open that I have to struggle every time I use this cup. Second, it is very hard for babies to suck from this straw. I tried myself and I could hardly get anything into my mouth. Third, it's very hard to clean! The straw is very hard to take apart.I can't believe they designed such a cup for babies. It is so hard to use that I had to give up after 3 weeks' trying and threw it away. This is the worst baby cup I've ever seen."
2,"Good cup, bad lid","I bought three of these for my kids to use. Almost immediately one of the lids cracked at a seam and the cup started to leak like crazy. I contacted Munchkin customer service and they very quickly sent me a new lid. Since then all three lids have cracked, and when I contacted customer service again, they again responded quickly and sent me three lids, this time without handles.I have other Munchkin cupsicles that don't have the handles and those lids have never cracked or had a problem - there is just something about the design or manufacture of the handle lids that needs some work."
1,Never received the item,I never received the item.The seller no answered me my inquiries and Amazon do nothing this time.What happen Amazon?
5,simple and effective,"No, it will not add any exotic discovery to your culinary knoledge, neither will it get you new, unexplored recipes from beyond.But, it does help a lot with everyday lunches, snacks for meeting friends, and shows it clearly 'how to' that dish you always see at the vegetarian restaurant but never knew exactly what was in.Awesome start for begginers, great for little experienced and still quite worthy for experts."
5,Love It!,Wonderful melodies and harmonizing. These guys are great together and separately as well. I hesitate to call it soothing-although I guess it can be. There isn't a lot of percussion or loud bass. The vocals really come through and they blend beautifully.
5,No Bugs in the Word Perfect,"I discovered my MS Office had a bug in it, and came that way from the factroy. I looked Word over and it was clean. Then the program itself. It does everything and well, and it does it without the tracking bug on it."
3,"""Ooops, I'm an NFR!""","Did what was necessary, but I missed the part about it having a Not-For-Resale serial number. I still would have bought it, but I wouldn't have asked Corel a support question and embarrassed myself. Oops. (Not like that XP Pro Install disk that turned out to be a SP3 disk w/o access to IIS.)"
5,"A thoughtful, no hype, solid content book","I have just finished reading this book and have been rewarded, as a ""change"" practitioner, this book adds real value in bringing the streams of change together. It is rare when I read a book on the subject and find it rewarding, enhancing what I do at the coal face. No, quick fix recipes but a thoughtful, well constructed set of ideas that do justice to this complex subject. I would reccomend this book to those who want to get beyond ""listmania"" and into some real thinking of what is involved in the dynamics of change."
2,Steering wheel cover,Sorry to say but it is a poor quality product. I'm not satisfied with it! Hope you can improve it! Thanks!
1,This product was supposed to fit my F150 steering Wheel and it was to small,Product did not fit the steering wheel it was supposed to fitpurchased one from Pep Boys fit fine cost me a few more dollars.
1,horrible,"this thing is horrible, it fades in the sun after a couple weeks, its very HOT to the touch, and it stinks and has bad chemicals on it(says so on the cardboard insert)."
1,GETS YELLOW FAST!,It arrived a little yellow around the edges but it didn't bother me too much because of the low price but i had it on for a couple of days now and it turned all yellow and ugly. don't buy!
3,It was just ok,"The color of the steering wheel cover was not as shown in the picture, it was somewhat paler. I liked the sport grips."
4,insightful journey,Lear led a harrowing life that would have undone many of lesser mettle. I found her insights powerful on the effect unloving mothers and fathers have on their children and the subsequent victimization of those children by others (and their own selves). It deals with rough topics but the journey is worthwhile.
4,Could have been better,"I'm a big GG fan, and have followed the show since the beginning. However, seasons 4 and 5 were not my favorite. I found myself bored with some of the episodes and also felt the writers were trying to cram too many storylines in at once."
5,Great Show,"This was fun to watch and it was a great show. I'm glad Amazon offers this. Very fun, I wish it was a few hours long though :)"
4,Daring to Dair?!,"During the fourth season of Gossip Girl the writers wisely decided to only flirt with the idea of a Dan and Blair(Dair) relationship. Unfortunately, they decided to explore that relationship during the fifth season, a move that many feel ruined the series. Which is a shame because the fifth season was shaping up to be one of the best of the series."
5,Gossip girl,These episodes are an easy way to catch up if you have missed any on tv. The sound and picture quality are fantastic and there are NO commercials! ;) it is definitely worth the 1.99
4,Video Library,I do not own a television and turn to the Internet for my television fixes. I purchased the Gossip Girl passport and love how easy it is to watch the GG episodes any time. The streaming rarely has hiccups and I can re-watch any fantastic Chuck Bass scene as much as I want!
5,Addicted,I'm totally addicted to this and shamefully many other series but this is one of my favorites. I received this file and the quality is very nice and easy to watch on my kindle Fire.
5,"Love the show, but least favorite season","This show has always been over the top, but this season took the cake. I mean marrying a prince? Just because it was happening in real life does not mean, ""oh it is okay for a storyline."" No. To over the top. Oh well I guess that is what makes this show so entertaining. I gave it a five star though because this show as been my main and most favorite show since it started. Hopefully I don't have to buy it and my dad does. I'm going to try to sneak it into the cart hehe."
3,Not impressed,"I got this on a friday sale, so I paid less than it usually is, but, price aside, I was not impressed. It just is not really attractive and does not look like a quality item IMHO."
3,"Good start, but limited strategy","Gamblers who are unsure of all the rules of a casino game or want to understand the basic concepts of when to hold'em and when to fold'em will find the information in this text to be useful. However, once the simplistic directions in this book are mastered, you will have to move up to more thorough and specific books aimed at one particular game.By trying to cover all casino games, only cursory attention is given to mastering any of them. Therefore, with this book under your arm, you will be able to confidently walk into a casino and know that you are above-average at any table, but an expert at none."
5,A good introduction,"For a beginner, this book is a good starting point to casino poker. Most of the in-depth material is on Hold'em and 7 card stud, but the book does skim over some lesser-played games too. If you're curious about getting into the game, the price is right."
2,Not for the money,"Not at all good for the money. The handles started coming off in the first use itself. The canvas looks of better quality, but the stitches and all are poor. Don't buy. Look for better ones."
2,Good and bad,"The bag is decent sized with pockets at both ends and three zipper pockets along the side. All good there. When I got it, the hook and loop closure on one of the end closures was barely tacked down on two sides, instead of being sewn properly on all four.Beware when buying that you understand that this bag is NOT the one with the backpack straps. It presents itself exactly the same, at the same price, as the one with the straps, but does not have them. This is not something I enjoyed finding out when I recieved it."
3,Not so much Dumm,"This book was recommended to me . However, I found it to be very 'dry'. Perhaps because it is so scholarly?"
2,Great Bottle shape not so great fragance,"I gave this to my wife as an extra gift, fortunately cause although she loved the bottle it came in, she wasn't to trilled once she opened it and smelled it. I have to say it kind of smell like the cologne my grandma likes to wear. So instead she uses it as a nice decoration piece in the tray where her nicer perfumes are."
1,Well I don't know,It kind of smells like diorissimo but a cheap version of it. I will NEVER EVER buy it again... Judging from the reviews I though it was a good perfume. What are these people thinking?????????????
2,not what I wanted,This book was not what I wanted. There were no experiments to build a robot. It was mostly about programming and developing boards.
2,too many mistakes,"I agree with some of the other reviews. There is some helpful information inthis book but it's nothing which can't be found elsewhere.It might be worth reading but I suggest skipping theexamples since they contain too many errors, and aren'tspaced or documented well enough for easy understanding and debugging."
1,should be titled 123 robotics experiments for chior boys,"This whole series of books is so misleading!! There is nothing ""fringe science"" or remotely dangerous or interesting in most of these ""evil genius"" books. NOTHING EVIL and NOTHING CLOSE TO GENIUS. This guy should give up writing these awe-un-inspired books - the kind of books that are so mediocre they probably do more harm than good - when kids get bored and turned off by reading this crap they just might turn evil and hopefully burn all of predkos crappy books."
2,Misleading title,"This author has the ability to obscure even the simplest concepts.Perhaps it is intentional, sort of a puzzle book where you have to work so much more (and spend so much more) to get anything done. Calling this book 123 robotics experiments is misleading at best. More than half of the book deals with textbook homework of the dullest kind and generally assumes that the user understands terms or concepts that have not been previously introduced and which only a seasoned engineer would know what they mean.You will learn, enjoy and save a lot more if you get the BASIC Stamp Discovery Kit which is not only a superb introduction to practical robotics but it also includes all you need to succeed."
2,Bijbelse Verhalen Voor Jonge Kinderen,"Amazon.com suggests that readers of Arnon Grunberg's novel would also enjoy ""Bible Stories for Young Children"". Mr. Grunberg would no doubt enjoy that irony. Mr. Grunberg's bildungsromane about growing up in A'dam as a disaffected youth is mildly entertaining at times. In his attempt to shock us with his character's utter inability to care, his complete lack of direction and connection, however, one quickly looses interest. This is no ""Goodbye Columbus"" or ""Catcher in the Rye"" as the jacket copy writers claim."
5,electro perfection for fans of the whole retro 80s movement,"I was so excited to stumble upon this single by The Protocol, which is easily going to be compared to The Killers and The Bravery. The Bimbo Jones mix is a stompin electro house mix, and both the a-side and b-side capture that retro 80s danceable alternative rock feel. I've already ordered their other single ""She Waits for Me"", and just wish the remixes for that song would be released on a single--as far as I know, they are only on a vinyl 12"". I also can't wait for the full length CD."
1,Very disappointing....,"These are advertised as tiny sardines (tiny tots) but they are almost exactly the same size as the King Oscar double layer sardines in the red label. I have taken a photo of one of each can, opened next to each other. You can hardly tell the difference. Why should I pay so much more for sardines that aren't any smaller or different tasting? Very disappointing."
5,dr who,excelant dvd i allway liked the dr who programs but offent as not i wond up missing some of the episodes so now i can watch dr who knowing that i have all of the episodes
4,Healing Touch music,One of the best CD's for helping healer and healee enter a state of calmness and tranquility.
3,*NOTHING TO EXCITING*,"This was an okay read. I did like the two main characters, Penelope and Aiden. Their lives were a sad turn of events that was touching. However I was expecting a little more of an erotic story. Good but few and far between ""erotic"" scenes. I'm afraid I like it from the beginning to the end, unless the story is entriguing enough. This did not hold my attention. Which isn't the worst because I went to sleep at a descent hour. I hope this helps."
3,"Read it for the setting and imagery, not the story itself","I hesistated between 3 and 4 stars. The author has a deep knowledge of the region and people. Delving into the protagonist's mindset was thoroughly enjoyable.Wilson has enough analogies in this book to fill several novels. They're great, but there's just too much. The book is a murder mystery at some level. The premise and the high level plot is pretty good, but the story ties together at the end messily. Very James Bond / Desmond Bagley-like. You know -- tidy it all up with the bad guys volunteering all the missing pieces to the good guy.I recommend this book for the West African setting and its substantial, grey characters. This is my first Wilson book; I would read another."
3,promising start to series,"Robert Wilson's INSTRUMENTS OF DARKNESS is the first in a series of mysteries set in Africa featuring a white British character named Bruce Medway. Medway does odd jobs for a collection of eccentric Africans operating on both sides of the law. The plot is so baroque as to be almost incomprehensible, but what's really going on is lots of atmosphere. Wilson knows Africa and he gets the details right....Much darker than the No. 1 Detective Agency books, will appeal to fans of Le Carre, Graham Greene, etc.....Funny and exciting, lively 1st person narration.....recommended...."
4,Very well written.,"The subject matter is harrowing, but the book is very well written and difficult to put down. I liked it."
1,Be careful,"After several months my new UV lamp has stopped working. I contacted Amazon and the seller and I think is important for other customers to know how we are protected. AMAZON DIRECTED ME TO THE SELLER, THE SELLER TO HONEYWELL and so on. Finally, people from HONEYWELL explained to me that THEY GIVE NO WARRANTY FOR PRODUCTS SOLD ON AMAZON. I DO NOT KNOW HOW YOU ARE COVERED WITH WARRANTIES FOR OTHER PRODUCTS BUT BE CAREFUL."
3,Good and bad,"Amazon replaced my unit free when it broke after 11 months. The manufacturer told me to call Amazon and not them. Thanks Amazon for replacing the unit. It seems to me the manufacturer should have replaced it. The product appears to be good quality, so I am not sure why it broke after 11 months. I hope the replacement one lasts a long time. The unit is made to stay on all the time. I think other models turn on and off. I would say it is your call whether you want to give it a try."
4,"Very Good, but Not Complex",This is a great magazine for those who want to find out about current scientific topics but do no want to delve into the complexity of scientific matter like Scientific American.This is a great magazine to buy for those that are high school ages. Those who have strong technical backgrounds may find the articles a bit lacking in substance and length. The average article length is only about 2 or 3 pages and often you feel as though they could have added more.One particular enjoyment I find in the magazine is the What's New feature. This highlights the best new inventions and innovations every moth culminating in their annual Best of What's New issue in December.I would reccommend this magazine to anyone with a amateur interest in science and technology and wants to be kept up to date.
3,"Great content, but unsuitable advertising for your children","I have read PopSci for decades, and so quickly started a subscription for my son at age 10 when he showed interest. The articles are very good, but the advertisments are riddled with sexual peformace boosting products of all sorts.I think that PopSci has a responsibility to consider that it is read by and marketed to children as well as adults, and should take a closer look at its sponsors. I couldn't let him bring it to school without ripping out pages first. I haven't noticed this problem with other periodicals of the same standing. By the way, when I contacted PopSci about my concerns about this, I received no response. Do advertisers come before the reading public?"
5,Wonderful magazine for the inquisitive mind!,"I ordered this magazine for my husband, knowing it was up his alley, but had no idea I would like reading the magazine as well. I couldn't believe the latest edition with the prizes given to students/people who came up with great scientific ideas or products. Most were amazing, but a couple were eye-opening and made me think ""why don't we have that already??"" Plus this magazine had tidbits of electronics, many many ebay ads (haha, I love ebay too), and overall is quite interesting. Wonderful graphics that help you understand the scientific ideas. A great gift for an inquisitive person!!! A+++!!! Will reorder next year!"
1,Problems with the publisher/shipping,I ordered this a while ago around March/April and today is July. I still have yet to receive the first issue. I called them up and said they will fix the problem so we'll see.not so happy so far.
3,"Good price, but got old issues...","I ordered my subscription a month ago and today I just received not one but three magazines all at once. One was last month's, one this month's and one for next month. Why did I get sent expired magazines? I had already seen last month's and this month's issues at the library. Did I get sent old issues cause they were about to be recycled? Well I guess Istill have nine more left."
1,Did not want but they renewed,Did not enjoy not enough good article for a magazine of this type. tryed to cancel but no avail would not suguest even if you get it free.
5,Fun to read!,"I subscribed because Amazon was selling it dirt cheap (The postage has got to cost more than that price!), and was really surprised how much interesting stuff is in there. My son and I both really enjoy reading this little magazine. To those that consider this too shallow, you should know better. It's a entertaining little magazine geared for the mainstream reader and not for the M.I.T. crowd."
4,I look forward to this magazine.,"Having subscribed to Popular Science Magazine for the past three years, I have to say there is always something interesting and enlightening in every issue. The appeal of the magazine is more geared toward those interested in science fiction, tinkering, conceptual thinkers, and/or early adopters of new technologies. I can see where the appeal can lack for others as you can see from other reviews, but if you match any of the above groups that may be of interest, head to a local supermarket and thumb through a copy.If you like what you see, ten dollars is more than fair for the interesting and thought-provoking stories you'll find every month."
2,Too much advertising!,"Will the substave articles are interesting and informative, there is too much advertising. It makes me wonder if I have purchased a magazine to be informed about new subjects or have purchased advertising."
4,price for renewal,Would like to have realized the auto-renewal was more than original as income is very low. Was believing the auto-renewal would be at the price paid for the 1st years subscription of $5.00 but that was just a come-on to get one started. Great informational magazine at any price.
3,I want my old pop-sci back,"I had a subscription to this magazine for ten years, and loved every page of every isue- but, thay changed in the last year or so to trying to be more ""hip"" ;it doesent have the same information it once had, still good and shiny stuff inside, just not enough to warent twenty-four bucks for me. oh well."
2,Meh,"I used to love reading my parents subscription to this magazine... but it seems to have been watered down significantly over the last decade. Anymore, after the ""gee whiz"" factor wears off, I am not left with any real feeling of substance of signficant scientific insight."
1,Looking for more...,"I am currently a junior in college studying biology. I was looking for a magazine that would showcase new technology and have insightful articles. I was very disappointed with this magazine and I cancelled it after I received the first issue. It was short--less than 100 pages. Most of the articles featured scientific ""toys"", in which the price was included. I felt like I bought a lengthy advertisement instead of a magazine. The articles that weren't selling goods were not much better. One article blamed the Joplin tornado on global warming, and then backed it up with laughable evidence."
3,Good but not what I was expecting,"I believed this magazine to be more into science but it turned out to be a venture into ""here's paper for paper airplanes"" and ""look at this guy who invented a shower that recycles water"" as opposed to actual biology or physics and so on."
4,Great publication,I love this magazine and have been reading it for years. I think that the last few pages are just filled with way too many advertisements that have nothing to do with the kind of science that is in the magazine. The magazine overall is just enough science in not too sciencey of terms so normal people can really understand and enjoy it. This really is one of my favorite magazines because it covers a lot of different advancements in science and engineering all in one magazine.
4,This was a gift,This was purchased for someone else so I really can't rate it. I know that he thinks that it is pretty interesting.
3,Nice magazine,"This is a good magazine to read. There are better science magazines out there, but they cost more money. This is a good deal for the price."
5,Love Popular Sicence,Have always read this magazine. I would recommend it to everyone to keep abreast of what is happening now in the world.
4,"Good story, But more ads then i perfer","The magazine has alot of good articles and my only gripe is that there are more ads then there use to be a couple of years ago which I don't like, But it is a good magazine if you are in to science or technology."
1,"Used to be good, now they are just left wing hacks","This used to be a useful magazine. Now they merely carry water for the Global Warming alarmists. Their July 2012 article titled 'the Battle' is a perfect example of this new endeavor. It is the worst piece of journalism I have ever read. This is not science, it is political hackery. There is no circumstance where you should waste your money on this, unless you march in lockstep with Al Gore."
1,"To much left, to much sex.","I got real excited when I saw the 24 month subscription offer here on Amazon. I read Popular Science when I was a lot younger and I thought it was terrific, so I almost pulled the trigger on the 24 Month Deal. Instead, I went out an bought the current issue and started reading.This publication was not the great magazine that I remember. The articles are to short, capturing your interest with a new idea or angle and new ways of seeing things, but that is not always enough. The reader is left wanting for more. Based on their advertising it's hard to figure out the true target reader here in 2012. Now that it's punctuated by the far left, it's really hard to find a good reason to read this pub, or even look at the pictures. That's what Regan would say."
4,Interesting stuff,Popular Science has a lot of interesting articles that are written in a way that anyone can understand them.This magazine keeps one up to date on the latest science stuff.
2,Not what it used to be,I haven't read Popular Science in 10-15 years and was interested in getting the family into reading it. But yikes -- each issue is basically a huge ad. Many articles are just product spotlights a.k.a. promotion. Very little actual science content in each issue. Sad. Not renewing my subscription that expires in 1 month.
3,Buyer beware. A one year subscription reduced to 9 months.,Received 3 different issues on 3 consecutive days. Publisher mailed old issues that I had already read thus reducing a one year subscription to 9 months.
1,where's my magazine dudes?,"5 months and numerous phone calls to the subscription peddler and still not one single magazine has been delivered! i strongly urge the readers to not buy the subscription here and go directly to the Popular Science site, that is, if you actually want to read the magazine."
4,Popular Science,"Like the quick reads on new gadgets, as well as more in-depth science-related stories. Easy reads, very reasonable price."
4,12-year old Science-lover LOVES this,"Gifts that continue to arrive each month are always fun for kiddos and my 12-year old, science-loving nephew gave this gift 2 thumbs up. His interest level is far beyond childrens' science magazines and this is not too advanced for his knowledge level."
2,Shocked!,"I bought this magazine subscription for my grandson's 12th birthday. Luckily, I had it come to my house first. I had to go through and censor the magazine. It had very explicit advertisements geared towards sex. Not something a 12 year old should be exposed to. I found this under magazines for children 12 to 16. I think you should change the age group for this type of magazine. It's a shame that you have those ads, as I will continue to censor them as they come in, but I will discontinue this magazine in a year and go with a more age appropriate magazine."
1,Haven't received it!,"Ordered in May, 2007, it's July, 2007 and still haven't received any magazines! What's the deal?"
1,fraud beware,you will receive maybe 2 or 3 magazines after that none!. Beware fraud! its not just me review all comments before ordering
1,Entirely to Politically Correct,A perfect example of no science and to much politics. Just another rag for the climate change crazies. Don't buy it.
5,Always great.,I love this magazine! There are always interesting and informative articles in every issue. I really enjoy the articles about upcoming technological advances.
5,good reading,Pop Sci has been a favorite with me for over 40 years. The $5 subscription makes it a no brainer.
1,Lost Popular Science Subscription,I never received my subscritption to Popular Science. So I guess my review is either bad or inconclusive.
2,Only two stars . . .,"I can only give it two stars because three of 12 issues arrived in the past two weeks. To me, that is unsatisfactory. I expected that editions would be roughly 4 weeks apart."
1,"Great Magazine, but....","The Magazine is great, nevertheless my physical address was lacking information the senders (POPULAR SCIENCE) so, I only received 4 issues of a 1 year subscription."
2,Review,"Have not recieved this product yet, a month later. Nothing to review so far really. I wish I had an expected arrival date."
2,I Hate The Politics,"I have been a subscriber to Popular Science for nearly ten years. I never detected a political bias, that is until the current editor took over a few years ago. His political bias was immediately obvious. I don't need politics in my science, but liberal politics pervades every corner of the magazine under the current editor. Everything from the topics covered, to the perspective of the articles, is steeped in liberal bias. I liked the magazine a lot better without the propaganda, when the editor's politics were imperceptible. I will not be renewing my subscription."
1,Terrible ads,"I subscribed this magazine, hope my kids can enjoy it. Then I found out it has Viagra and enlargement ads. Come on."
4,Great for keeping up on new technology!,"This is the greatest magazine I have ever read. My dad got a subscription when I was about 11 years old ('87), and I have been a faithful reader ever since. If you're interested in new technology, and new ideas this is the magazine for you. Popular Science isn't always about the ""geek"" topics either, they frequently feature practical advances in bicycles, automobiles, nuclear reactors, skin grafts, fighter jets and everything else. Don't mistake Pop. Sci. for a scientific journal either. The writers do a great job of keeping the articles at an interesting level; they don't bore you with all the scientific principals of their topics, but they do explain enough so that you get the basic idea behind a concept. My one and only complaint about the magazine is that occasionally their stories have a liberal bias, but overall it's good stuff. There's a reason this magazine has been around for over 100 years. Try it out, I doubt you'll be disappointed."
4,$5 Popular Science Subscription,Took advantage of a special to get a year's subscription to Popular Science. I have enjoyed reading the magazine but probably will not renew.
4,Very good for scratching the surface of science.,"I do enjoy this publication greatly. It is not quite as technical and in depth as I would like, but how many people would subscribe if it were readable only to physics PhDs? I do rather enjoy the 'scratching the surface' approach to the articles. I find that there is enough information to give a good overview and decent scientific understanding of the topic yet it is not so complex that I feel as if I am 'working'.There are also some interesting nerdy fun articles such as the worst ideas from the DOD (flying humvees, mutant mosquitos, etc...) to keep a smile of your face. However, the vast majority of the articles are serious and well written. There is enough variety of chemistry, astronomy, physics, biology, and environmental science to keep most scientifically minded people interested. I look forward to each and every issue."
2,PG15-,"The biggest advantages of this mag are it's cheap and it's really 'popular'. Which means you don't need much science education to understand almost all their articles. It's an ok reading for children in their tender age, say 15 and below. Why PG? as other reivewers had pointed out, the loads of ads populated at the back of the mag are not scientific and often sxual oriented. If you do not yet wish to expose the next day delivered Viagra to your ten-year-old son, rip a few pages off before giving it to your kids."
2,"better than a comic book, I guess","When I was a teenager <cough>, I liked this magazine. But over the years I've become really disappointed in the thin gimicky style. Lots of hype and filler, and not much meat. These types of magazines tend to carry numb-brained scare-and-fantasy oriented titles like ""Will Einstein's theories cause lethal tidal waves?!?"" and ""Nanotechnology's promise of immortality"". <sigh>. Discover magazine and Scientific American are better, but only slightly. I'm much more impressed with Science magazine."
3,Nice,I've enjoyed Popular Science for years and this is the first time I have subscribed to it. I am very glad to have it delivered to my home. I am a little disappointed that it doesn't contain as much information as it used to.
5,Popular Science & the Future,"this magazine is great for keeping up to date (even possibly ahead of most people) with recent science discoveries and plans for the future. looking at what might be ahead is great, especially if you're planning and you can save up for certain things if that's what you're into.i would recommend this for anyone who likes science and is an intellectual."
4,Not just for Geeks,All the up to date news in the world of Science; written in basic easy to understand English. I have been buying this magazine for years.
2,I hope the car companies are getting paid...,"About half of every issue of this magazine is devoted to glowing articles about new car models and other commercially-available gadgets.When I subscribed, I hoped to be kept abreast of new discoveries and theories in science, as well as their practical applications. I was disappointed. Perhaps I'll try Scientific American next."
2,Did not received.,Well he is still waiting. This was a gift. It is med January and no magazine. It should of been delivered this month. I checked my order and everything looks correct so it must be on the order takers side.So far service is pretty poor.
5,For Some It's Cars.... For Others It's Science,"If you hate Vogue, Seventeen, YM, Teen People, Entertainment Weekly, US, etc. this is the magazine for you! If you're young like me ( almost 20 ) the people you call friends may just roll their eyes when you have this magazine on your table... It's way better than the [stuff] they read, I just wish there were more pages to it!"
1,Horrible,"This wonderful looking magazine is 2/3's full of adverts (low estimate). And is heartlessly supportive of weaponry for the mass murder of fellow men. Please do not shake hands with these uncaring people, I will not be buying their magazine again."
5,Great magazine! Husband loves it!,"Got this for a present for DH, and he is very happy with the magazine. Says, ""It has everything I want to read in it!"""
2,In appropriate contents in popular science magazine,"Initially, I thought this was a pretty good magazine so i renewed it but lately I noticed some real inappropriate advts in this magazines and I don't feel comfortable sharing this mag with my 14yr old. Such magazines are NOT good for grown up kids/13plus."
2,Problem with the auto-renewal,I renewed 3 time in a year. The auto-renewal kick in after 5 mos. I cannot cancel the order. Don't do auto renewal.
4,magazine,"I was hoping there would be instructions provided on how to view the magazine on my tablet, but there wasn't any."
1,Magazine subscription renewal,"So far, this purchase is terrible. I purchased this to extend my existing subscription. Supposedly, if I already subscribed to the magazine, my existing subscription would be extended. I would not have to worry about getting duplicate subwscriptions. I received my latest magazine Friday (Sept. 17) and there was a notice regarding my subscription expiring. My subscription purchase was on Aug. 18. How long does it take for this renewal to take effect? Can I find out if it has been renewed at all?Popular Science (1-year auto-renewal)"
3,A SCIENCE MAGAZINE FOR ME ??,"I DON'T KNOW WHY I ORDERED THIS MAGAZINE. MAYBE I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE MORE INTERESTING TOPICS OR SOME TWILGHT ZONE TYPE STORIES OR SOMETHING. MY BAD. SOMEONE WHO IS A SCIENCE NUT WILL PROBABLY LOVE THE MAGAZINE, JUST NOT FOR ME, SORRY."
1,Greenwashed,"I grew up with Pop Sci, used to be a good magazine. Now, preachy. Wake up, Pops,not everyone thinks the science of global warming, ethanol for cars, etc is actuallyscientific and rational. But like the NYT, dissent is heresy, and the openquestions about these issues are not only brushed aside, but scorned by the editorsand writers.If I want to read about conserving carbon I'll listen to Al Gore /sarcasm off.Don't bother. Like Scientific American, the magazine has gone to the lunatic left."
2,Turned Political,It's too bad that they have succumed to pushing the leftist political agenda. It used to be a great magazine. I'm not renewing my subscription.
1,"Still going to the wron address,","I am very upset, this magazine of Popular Science is still coming to my Mesquite address, It is supposed to be going to my son in Woodville Texas, I have received the second issue and my son has bot received any at all. Also I have not received Vegetarian Times as of yet at my Mesquite Address. I am thinking of asking for a refund for these magazines. I originally ordered them to go the correct address's and when I called to check on them when I ordered them the girl from Amazon messed up the addresses. I am getting very angry and want the problem corrected and additional issue added to the subscriptions to cover the issues not received at the correct addresses. you may contact me at 972-285-4969 I have also contacted the magazine themnselves and was assured that this would be corrected."
1,Popular Science,"I will not subject my children to the sexual nature of the advertisements in this magazine. It is outrageous, and of course varies from issue to issue, but don't be fooled- they are in cahoots with the rest of the media trying to pervert our children so we can have more perverted adults, no thank you! Put that crap somewhere else, it is unnecessary in a kids/teen geared magazine."
2,Too comitted to the notion of global warming.,"Treats the notion of global warming as proven fact. While climate has always changed and always will, the impact of humanity on it is far from settled fact."
1,Never got it,Ordered this magazine and was charged and still have not received a single issue 35 days later. Don't understand why. I Double checked address everything seems to be fine but still no magazine. Will msot likely call and see what is going on but greatly disappointed.
3,Ok magazine,"Quality of magazine is below my expectation. Seems many articles were written by kids (or fresh college graduates) . Besides, it blends in too much ideology in the contents. If without the excellent article in the last issue about the ""battery"" (forget the exact title), I'd cancel my subscription because even my children do not read it.I keep the subscription because it's cheap and for the occational good articles."
2,Shipping takes 4months!!,"I have read that this is a great and very interesting magazine, and i do not have an issue with the product it's self. BUT i ordered this magazine a(2 year subscription) before Christmas, and now Amazon says that the 1st one will arrive in march sometime? That is ridiculous, and even though it is a great low price, i would have expected it arrive by now."
4,Popular is Prime,"Fantastic value for money but sometimes mundane topics covered, however an overall worthwhile read of relevant scientific subjects and technology"
3,Works as expected,"Yup. It does what it says. It's a voltage transformer.It rattles a lot, which is very annoying.(Not just the usual 50/60hz voltage hum... I mean it actually *rattles* the metal casing. It's downright annoying and I ended up crazy-gluing the metal in several places to get it to stop making so much noise and rattling everything it sat on.)But it does work perfectly."
2,Nice accessory - but it's a battery-eater!,"We bought this crib light, despite reviews that it goes through batteries quickly. Unfortunately, those reviews were right. It eats batteries WAAAY too quickly - as in, it didn't last a month with very light use. The sounds and lights are captivating, and the voice-activated mode is handy, but having to unattach the thing all the time just to change the batteries (yet AGAIN) became a nuisance. Now it's just a non-functioning white box on our baby's crib. For ""womb sounds"", we just place a windup clock in the crib since it's the repetitive ""white noise"" that comforts the baby, rather than any electronic mother's heartbeat. I would have been better off spending my money on a musical mobile to hang."
2,Not that great,"I bought this hoping it could help provide a little response if our baby woke up in the middle of the night... but the light is too bright for that purpose, I think. (it needs to have brightness settings!)The sound sensor seemed a bit too insensitive, but frankly I did not even get to try out that feature.At least the device has the right type of hookup to be placed on the side of a crib."
1,none of them worked,"I would like to give zero stars since it didn't even work! I thought this would be a great item for our baby. I read the reviews and thought that it seemed like a good product (if you got one that worked). So ordered my first one and it didn't work, ordered another and it didn't work either. Needless to say I am returning the second one and not ordering anymore. I am not sure why Muchkin continues to put out a defective product, it will make me think twice about purchasing their products again."
1,"Good idea, but never worked",I used this product maybe once and it never worked again. I not sure why this product does not have any labels or symbols for the settings. There is nothing on this that says on/off or sound/light settings so my husband and I just kept flipping different switches to try and get it to work. We used it once for nap time and then tried to figure out what combination of switches to press for bedtime later and never got it to work again. This is certainly a poorly made product.
3,Not that great for just checking on the baby,"If you are buying this product just as a crib light for checking to see if the baby is sleeping on his back, it has some limitations. The colored lights vary in intesity to sometimes you see the little one and sometimes you don't. Also, for turning it there is a big button on top but turning it off is a differnet harder to find button. If you are looking for something to try to get the baby to calm down and fall alseep to it *may* work because the lights are pretty and the noise is typical for these things. It is a good price."
1,does not work at all,"Unfortunately in the interest of ""being green,"" I recycled the box some time before I actually put batteries in this thing. So by the time I discovered that it completely DOES NOT WORK, it was too late to do anything about it."
3,crib light,"When I received the first crib light it did not work. My husband even hooked it up to a volt meter. We decided to try a replacement instead of getting our money back, and the new one worked great. I like the colors and it turned on when my daughter cried. She's good about sleeping through the night, so I don't know if it would put her back to sleep but it did distract her from crying. (For a little while)"
2,"Pretty crappy quality, nice idea","The womb noise is excellent and the lights are nice, but this thing is terribly built. The voice activation feature does NOT work. My son was screaming his head off and it didn't turn on at all. I also tested it myself at a few different volumes and tones and it has never turned on even once. It also only turns on about 60% of the time when I'm just trying to manually turn it on. At first I thought something was wrong with my batteries because the light would flicker a couple of times and then wouldn't turn on at all. I would return it if I had gotten it at a store, but don't feel like mailing it back in. I'd definitely NOT recommend this thing to anyone."
3,Munchkin Voice Activated Crib Light,It goes through batteries far too quickly. It has helped calm our little one but has not soothed her to sleep. Maybe it will work better when she's a little older.
2,Stopped working after a month. Maybe.,"I bought this with my newborn daughter in mind, the voice activation being the selling point. The first thing that made me wary was that the batteries (4 AA) died pretty quickly. Within a week, I'd say. Then after I replaced them, it died again. I thought, batteries again. Wrong. It's dead forever. It worked as stated when it did work, and put my baby into a trance with the lights, but unfortunately it didn't work long enough. Boo."
4,"A good book ; maybe , but not for me.","After reading the customer reviews I had great hopes of enjoying this book.I agree with most of what the reviewers had to say;but I still found it long,convoluted and not very enjoyable. One reviewer suggested that Kennedy was in a class with Steinbeck and one day might even win a Pulitzer,I hope he's right.Steinbeck is one of my favorites but I am sure not to everyone's liking.By the way I read Riding the Yellow Trolly Car and didn't care for it either.However;that's me ,give it a go,others really liked it."
3,Could of done with out the intros,Not for every one but still a fast and brutal record. Defiled are underground even in Japan where they are from so owning a CD of theirs is a pretty big deal for collectors. l really don't get the Cryptopsy comparisons these guys are more akin to Deeds of Flesh and Monstrosity. Although Defiled are not as technical as said bands they definatley hold their mark with awesome tracks like 'disguised' and 'uncovered plots'. The bassist on this album is pretty wild his jazz influence is a welcome addition.
3,"Pretty good death metal, but needs work",This is average death metal by some japanese guys. The production could have been better for the guy's voice isn't audible like other death metal albums and music is too cluttered and has unnecessary changes in tempo. Recommended for people interested in japanese death metal.
4,Cute and Fun,Super cute! I love it and so do my kids. I bought the pink one for my five year old daughter and the green one for my almost two year old son.
5,FUN Space Saver ! ! !,"What a great way to keep all those bulky stuffed animals!Our son, now 2, Loves it! He can easily open the zippers to get his favorite animals in and out o the bag, and it is actually comfy too!!!2 Full Size laundry baskets of animals fit inside, with rom for more!!!************************************************************************"
3,Clever but poorly constructed,"This animal bag is a clever solution to the problem of storing overabundant stuffed animals and it worked for a few weeks before the bag split along a seam, the zippers are excellent but the sewing on the seams is not strong enough. It is not an inexpensive item and I am disappointed that it has fallen apart..."
1,One of The Most Over-rated book of DP's!,"I've read almost all of DP's books, too, & I've got to say that this is 1 of the only 2 of hers that I neither bothered to read the middle nor the ending of! Completely uninteresting & non-gripping emotionally! Don't be fooled by the earlier reviewer's raves -- I only paid $2.99 on eBay to get this, & yet, I've regretted spending even those few dollars! This one's completely unworthy of anyone's time or money in my opinion.... Lynne Graham's THE SCILLIAN'S MISTRESS has a sort of a similar storyline, but by far, far, far more interesting!!! Get that one through eHarlequin instead of this one if U wish for an interesting, emotionally gripping romance novel -- U won't be sorry with that one, I promise!"
1,"great idea, terrible implementation","So stiff that it does not adjust to the contour of the windshield. If you have a perfectly flat windshield would probably work great. Any curvature at all to your windshield, and this is not the wiper for you. Even if it says it fits, it may not. It didn't for my 2000 Accord."
4,Brilliant premiere recording of this important opera.,"Helmut Rilling prepared the performing edition of J.C. Bach's opera and made minimal cuts for generally good, dramatic reasons. Also, it's sung in German rather than the original French. This opera has two unusual features: a bare minimum of da capo arias and orchestrally-accompanied recitatives, some of which verge towards the arioso or arietta. The choruses almost assume the nature of another character in the opera. It's eerie how much this opera sounds like late Mozart (e.g., The Magic Flute) even though written many years before. It also points toward Weber. Leading a scaled down modern instruments orchestra, Rilling gets spirited singing and playing. I give this four stars only because of the translation of the libretto into German. Strongly recommended."
3,Could have been 200 pages shorter,"From a technical perspective the book seems ok. it actually has some useful content. It would be a worthwhile purchase.However I'm not wild about the book because our man Jeffrey wastes pages and pages ranting redundantly about current conventional HTML techniques. The whole first chapter or two are about this. I understand, I sympathize, and it's good to know. The problem is he doesn't seem to ever feel like he's made his point and it's time to move on. Maybe they told him the book had to be at least 400 pages and he wrote the rants to fill it in or something."
3,"Good Information for newcomers, however...","if you've read zeldman.com in the past couple years, then unfortunately there is not much fruitfulness to purchasing this book. The first 4 chapters pound the same 4 ideas into your head relentlessly but at least present it with a quick wit and some levity.I had expected a more technical based book I guess, and was a little disappointed in some of the lack of information as far as quick examples et al.However if you've never browsed zeldman.com, or are bogged into designing your sites with nested tables - or stuck working somewhere that forces this method of design on you - this is a great book for you for:a.) backgroundb.) useful counter points to argumentative 'experts'c.) a good starting point."
1,"Useless book, don't waste your money","This is the worst technical book I've ever read (and I've read thousands in my career).It starts with 150 pages of advocacy: why it's a good idea to design with web standards. Mr Zeldman: if I wasn't already convinced that designing with web standards was a good idea, why would I buy a book called ""Designing with Web Standards""?The author is one of those humor-impaired people who think they are witty. Example: ""If changing tag fashions were all there was to it, ...this book would be filled with delicious tofu recipes. Like tofu honey pie with blueberries. Yum! It's even better if you use cream cheese instead of tofu. And sugar - lots of sugar. And butter and eggs - don't forget the eggs.""If you enjoy reading drivel like that, you might like this book. Perhaps it should have been titled ""Jokes that never made it to the Tonight Show"". But if you want to read about designing with CSS and XHTML, don't waste your time on it."
1,not instructive,too much emphasis on Why you should be designing using web standards rather than what and how to implement them. not instructive at all. this is definately geared to the seasoned developer not for a newbie
5,Life in the easy lane with web standards,"It would be an understatement to call this book and eye opener for me. Jeffrey Zeldman makes a compelling case for adopting web standards and gives plenty of immediately useful examples of how this can benefit anyone.I don't know how the adoption of standards by the major browser providers passed me by, I just wish I had read the book sooner.I'll be using many of his ideas and I expect to see pages that are easier to modify and maintain, with less strain on our servers.I also find the authors frequent comments on his blog very informative and/or thought provoking. I highly recommend the book for anyone involved in site design or development (for public consumption or for intranets)."
2,"If you want to learn web design, this is NOT the book","I want to learn web design, so I did some research on the topic. It seems everybody is saying this is a must-read for web designers. So I bought the book, read it and I must say this is NOT the book if you want to learn web design. If you don't know anything about HTML and CSS, this might be a OK intro book. Otherwise this is a total waste of time. I didn't learn any web design skills, and any sane person knows he needs to use web standard, except in reality not all browsers are created equal, so you have to resort to hacks to make it work, which author uses in the book and are definitely NOT the standard the author was advertising."
1,Straight dope,"Zeldman is revered in web-design circles. In fact, most aspiring web jockeys aspire principally to remain in his good graces. Have a look through the reviews - there are two kinds. The 4 and 5 star reviews are written by the ingratiating suck-ups hoping to win Zeldman's favor. The 1 star reviews are by those with the kahones to tell it like it is - there's no content in this garbage. It is the total abandonment of substance in favor of style - and not the CSS sort you're hoping for. It's all edge, attitude and posturing, giving the suck-ups what they crave.You need a book that will show you how to do constructive things. You don't need to submit to a cult of personality, which is all Zeldman is."
3,"Good, but not great","If you already believe that CSS/XHTML is the present and future of web page design, much of this book will be useless for you. Zeldman devotes a lot of ink to defining these technologies and convincing the reader that it is time to use them.However, there are some good tips inside, and the writing style is easy to read (if often overly flip).On the other hand, if you are still building HTML 3 or HTML 4 pages, or didn't know that HTML had version numbers, then this is the book for you!"
3,Good book but...,"Dan Cederholm's book had 2x more information and examples and was 2x thinner.J. Zeldman's book is a basic introduction to CSS, but is quite good for XHTML, Accessibility, and standards in general. This book is general purpose. It's a lot of blablabla and jokes too, and sometimes distracts the reader from what she should stay focused on. It shouldn't be your 1st book or you might get lost at times. The few examples are interesting. Zeldman should release a 2nd edition without all the talking about his own life and sarcastic stories, but with all examples from A List Apart. It would be very interesting. Ok, buy it if you already read the masterpieces of webdesign like Dan Cederholm and Eric Meyer :)"
4,"Simple, cheap and complete","This book is just I was looking for: a smart, cheap and complete Web Standards guide."
3,Great book....can the humor,"I dont know about how you feel about dry humor and sarcasm, but, when reading a ""how to"" book, I dont need it. This is a great resource BUT, Zeldman tries a little too hard to be funny. Word of advice, skip pages and read the meat of the book.It was a chore reading this book......."
3,"Eh, just so-so","This is a very good book if:a) you dont mind starting on page 141b) you can get past trite attempts at humor such as ""Not a Panacea, but Plays One on TV"" (page 107) or ""Poop in the Soup"" (page 134)The first 140-ish pages involve the author trying to convince you that you need to use standards, where the standards come from, the history of web design etc. The real meat for me started in Part II.I was not really into the author's sense of humor, but hey, maybe that's just me.There are many tasty nuggets in this one - you just have to do a lot of chewing."
3,Not what I expected from Mr. Zeldman,"I am a religious follower of A List Apart and Zeldman.com and come to expect quick code examples or roads to examples that will simplify my life as well as my users' experience. Chapters 1-4 provide extensive history and info that, truthfully, I have read in some form on Mr. Zeldman's site. That being the case, I found little use for the book until Chapter 5 where I culled minimal amount of info that could assist my daily coding. Not sure if this is a book geared towards newbies, but in my opinion, my money could've been spent in better ways."
5,Simply Outstanding,"Zeldman is to be congratulated on this writing. The book approaches the topic of designing with web standards in a very practical manner. I recomment this book to developers, managers and site designers. This book does not teach you CSS, but rather it teaches you how to use CSSm XHTML, ECMA script and DOM to develop web sites according to standards.I must say that Zeldman, among other good writing traits, has a pretty good sense of humor."
1,It is cheaper to buy a small Swiss Army knife and a USB stick!,I have had the same problem as all the other reviews - the USB memory stick software quits working after awhile and then any files you have on it are hopelessly locked.Buy a Swiss Army knife and a seperate USB 5 gig stick and save yourself some money and frustration!
3,For transport on planes?,"Item Description Quote: ""The small all-rounder integrates numerous useful tools: a stainless steel knife, scissors, a file and a screw driver, to carry when travelling on planes.""This seems an incorrect desciption. Since when, in the last few years, were you allowed to take knives , scissors etc on a plane?"
4,Fantastic detail... needs more 'pretty pictures',"Though I've just begun reading this book and am only a third of the way through, I'm quite impressed with the depth of information relayed by the author. The straightforward, easy-going manner in which the information is delivered is VERY helpful, seems to cover everything in great detail, and yet remains an easy read. This is a great 'beginner' book for a novice like myself, and I imagine it could probably still teach a seasoned pro quite a bit.My one major complaint (as mentioned by the previous reviewer) is the fact that there are not enough color images. Considering the topic being discussed, it would have been nice to see more examples of different artists works and styles. I guess this small problem can be easily remedied by supplimenting the purchase of this book with the purchase of a couple of colorful magazines."
1,"Does the job, but...","Metal spacers provided were waaay too long and needed to be cut. Paint peeled off after 10 minutes of use, even after I cured the grill and firebox. Would have returned it, but I need it for the Outlaw Grill which is of better quality. Once I repainted it it was fine.Update: Yeah, this is the worst thing I ever spent my money on. Paint keeps peeling in new spots after every use. Not going to stop until I repaint the whole thing with my own paint."
1,"char griller -- awkward, rusts","We have had the chargriller for just over a month. We did not get its cover on in time for one rain. It rusted profusely. Its tray on the bottom of the grill filled with water and had to be scooped out. The side grill also had water and had to be tilted and wiped out. The instrument is bigger than expected, awkward and not finished sufficiently to avoid the rust."
2,"Bad design, assembled poorly","We ordered this smoker for our grill in preparation for smoking a turkey on Thanksgiving. The welding was off, and there were gaps in the sliding coal drawer. As a result, we were unable to regulate the amount of air getting to the coals. Perhaps as a result of this, the paint on the top of the smoker bubbled and peeled off. We didn't receive it until right before Thanskgiving, so we didn't have time to return it. I wish we could have sent this item back. I would recommend buying your smoker from a store."
3,"It works, but with subpar construction","As a smoker, it works. As a grill, go with an open top Weber or similar. That said,Positives:- The air vent is decent to control temperature within a reasonable range- The removable grate is a nice feature, something not included on many comparably-priced competitive units- Installation was simpleNegatives:- Paint is pathetic. Bubbled and peeled within first use, and continues after 3rd use.- the wood handle weeps sap when the box gets hot. Be careful, it's like hot napalm to the unsuspecting guest- the spacer legs were too short and required a few washers to shim it to the unitIf you buy this, get some fiberglass tape as well to seal the lid to direct all smoke to the adjacent grill."
1,No Pride,"This companies BBQ was great! but when i recieved this side box smoker I was amazed....The hinges were broken off, the tray is so crooked that i can barely get it in and out it has a huge gap that will have to be fixed and the whole box had to be tweaked to get it to bolt on.....good thing i can weld and fix things!........This was pathetic!I am very disapointed that a company would turn out such crap and actually let it go out the door that way!.............To make matters worse the box was in perfect shape so someone actually packaged it like that.......so it didnt happen in shipping just ........NO QUALITY CONTROL!"
3,"Works Decent, Looks Bad","I was excited to try out the new fireside box for my duo grill. Put it together, and it doesn't sit flush with the other part of the grill, and the slide out ash tray does not fully seat into the fireside box, making air flow control almost impossible. Those discretions aside, it performed its function, and provided great smoke at low temperatures in the main box. Be advised, the main charcoal box will cook hotter than normal after you put the fireside box on, and will be hard to maintain a low temperature due to all the air gaps after attaching the fireside box. All-in-all i would've kept my grill the same without the fireside box and bought a standalone smoker for the same price."
2,"Simple, but a rust bucket!","It does it's job, which isn't really hard. This is a simple concept without much to really go wrong. Purchased this item at a local store actually. I have the Char-griller 5050. Added this side box, and within 3 weeks the entire top half was covered in rust. 3 weeks! I always allowed my unit to cool, and then covered with the Char-griller Heavy Duty cover. Sorely disappointed in the quality of the finish on this side box. In fact my Char-griller 5050 is only two years old, and the mounts that hold up the propane deflectors on the gas side have completely disintegrated. I used to love Char-griller, but my next grill will not be from them."
2,Mixed breed of first two CDs,"Painting of a Painting was basically a combination of ""Smashing the Serene(still her best CD)--and Morbid Romantic. The lyrics were ok, none particularly moving, or worth remembering. I did not hum to the tunes like I did for the 1st album. I like Rachael Sage, and her quirkiness is still in her lyrics, but she needs some work done for her next album. I still enjoy Smashing the Serene--which is by far her best album, and I listen to that over and over...Anyone wanting a new voice to listen to, and can't find one, I highly recommend Smashing the Serene."
4,Kept my 5 year old's attention,My five year old listened to this whole book in one sitting. He didnt want me to stop. It was a great overview of our country's process of gaining independence. It introduces many of the concepts that can be expanded on later and with other resources.
2,Disappointing.,"I was looking for a concise, yet interesting, book about the American Revolution. Though the vocabulary is age-appropriate and the information factual, the style is uninteresting, and the book gives none of the fascinating details that could bring the period to life."
2,could have been a better case,"the case itself is somewhat chintzy, space is very tight, and could use a handle strap (can be awkward to carry in one hand because of thickness)"
2,ok,"The big display is a great feature. Other than that, there isn't much I like about this unit. When trying to use it as a multimeter, the numbers bounce all over the place, not inspiring confidence. Once connected to get a reading, the numbers continue to bounce, occasionally stopping the bounce to give a reading. The tach feature is very finicky to use. Again, sometimes it works, sometimes it won't, not inspiring confidence. I have another meter I use for higher readings, which I use most of the time. When I need to get a lower reading, I'll try to use this one, but still end up going back to the other."
4,Not top of the line but definitely a must have book!,"The lesssons are in simple terms and short, to the point. They are easy to understand for users with little to zero experience. Try out the first lesson by downloading it on line. You will be plesantly surprised!"
5,A Book to Return to Again and Again,"The author states in the introduction that ""Contemporary Christian worship tends to focus on fostering emotional intimacy with God. While this is a good thing, emotions will carry a person only so far, and then he's going to need something more substantive. Apologetics can help to provide some of that substance"" (p 19). In our culture of quick pleasure and easy emotion, it is refreshing to see a serious argument for something beyond physical satisfaction. I constantly keep this excellent source on hand. The bottom line is, it contains strong arguments for the faith that are unmatched in this day and age. It is not a light read, nor should it be, but instead focuses on ""mental"" satisfaction through the discussion of importance life questions."
5,Craig is briliant author,"As a Theologian and a Philosopher myself, I found this book very usefull, briliant, and one of the kind. Craig is a wonderful and a briliant author. This book explains clearly about the most common questions and doubts about the truth of Christianity. This book is a logical book, that bring together between faith and reasons. Highly recomended...."
5,Finally got this book!,Great book...! a must have christian book. Will help you not only answer questions about your faith to others but also will make it stronger.
5,Great place to start,"I am currently taking an apologetics course and this is one of the books required. It is a very interesting approach to offensive apologetics. I also purchased the study guide, but I have not received it as yet."
5,Required Reading!,"This book is one of the best apologetic primers out there. However, I would highly recommend you seek out the audio version of the book as a companion to or instead of the book. The audio version is fabulously arranged and is not merely a reading of the book, but rather a course in and of itself."
5,"Heavy....Duty! Reasonable Faith, by Craig...","I took a lot of Tylenol for this book, the language for me was a bit over my capacity. I had to read this for a class I am taking a www.lru.edu but after I got through it, wow, what an amazing Apologist he is, and appreciate his call and perspective. what helped me was to listen to him on Youtube a couple times to help me digest what he was saying in this book. I would sell my copy for sure, but I a very happy I read it once."
4,A Christian book written by a Christian for a Christian,"I found this to be one of the better Christian apologetics books out there. However, this book seems to be heavily geared toward the Christian reader; I initially believed that it would be directed toward skeptics. I found that the author placed a lot of emphasis on personal experience. The arguments are well laid out and very well organized, but several of his ideas have been refuted by various authors and speakers. Although, as an atheist, I certainly did not agree with many of Dr. Craig's points, I enjoyed reading his ideas."
1,Refer Standard Deviants Biology,"This was developed in the standard Deviants Studio, for sure this will be available in Standard Deviants store, before you buy this check the price and the get the cheaper one, as here the same products are been sold under different covers with different pricesPlease refer the following topic by Standard deviantsStandard Deviants School - The Dissected World of Biology, Program 2 - The Cell (Classroom Edition)Teaching Systems is releasing the above one in the following name but priced a HIGHHHHHHHHTeaching Systems Biology Module 1: Molecules and Cells"
3,This book is for beginners,"If you are preparing to write a story on how you grew up in South Dakota, before your parents moved to California and you eventually ended up in Maryland, this book might have good tips for your memoires.The book is designed for beginners and gives tips on how people should write without editing so that they keep on writing, then how they should learn editing to improve their writing skills, and finally how to write with love and emotions, a tip that cannot apply to all kinds of writers.So if you are writing on that cookies recipe you came up with, or the memorable trip you made to the Bahamas, buy this book.But if you are more of a professional writer looking to publish a book on your experience in civil, military or diplomatic service, then you might a more serious text book for better advice.Also the style of the book is probably designed for sixth graders, with exercises and examples of fake journals."
1,disapointed,"I am a long time customer of Amazon and Amazon is my first place to look for books online. Normally the order arrives as ordered, on time or better.However this time was a major let down. A 3-5 day shipping turned out to be estimated to be delivered in 3 weeks from the date of the order!While that is outragous, the fact that is was never delivered is even worse. To top that the response time of support via email is measured in days and not hours. Overall - big big disapointment in Amazon. I hope this is an abberation and the great service and reliable Amazaon will re-emerge quickly."
1,Immunics is a dangerous con ...,"Immunics is a dangerous con perpetrated by ""Bayard Barnes"", a New Age charlatan and cult leader who has frequently changed his name and identity to stay one step ahead of the law.Cults in Our Midst: The Continuing Fight Against Their Hidden MenaceAs ""Gavin Barnes"" and later as ""Bayard Hora"" he was the leader of ""Direct Centering"" and ""Naexus"".Do some Googling and see for yourself."
5,Excelente diccionario,"Este diccionario es muy bueno comodo y se puede llevar en el bolsillo o mochila, a pesar de su tamaño tiene mas de 80.000 frases y palabras traducidas. El precio del diccionario es economico se lo recomiendo."
3,Formula changed,"Halo ""Daily Greens"" was one of the rare vitamin products that my finicky 21 year old kitty would tolerate. When I could no longer find it locally, I searched for it online and reordered from this seller. Delivery was a bit slow, but free--a fair compromise. What saddened me is that the vitamin formula must have been changed (or perhaps the batch I rcvd was not up to par in some way). When crushed and/or added to liquid, it's color was vastly different from that of my previous batch. It also smelled very STRONG and was not palatable to my kitty. Where were the ""greens"" that manifested themselves in the color and scent of the older version? Finding another satisfactory vitamin supplement will require more trial and error, but I won't order the Halo ""Daily Greens"" again."
1,The Formula Is Not As Stated...,"I have a dog with allergies, so we must scrutinize every ingredient in every food item for her. I read the ingredients carefully before ordering and imagine my unhappy surprise when my dog started to have an allergy episode after consuming a dose of these. The formula on the actual bottle I received is vastly different from the website description given here. DON'T BUY THESE IF YOUR PET HAS FOOD ALLERGIES! Hope this helps..."
3,Halo Vita Glo Daily Greens on Amazon.com,"Tablets are fairly large and need to be broken up for my 17+ year old cats. They will eat them, but prefer Greenies."
3,The smell of this is something else...,"Like concentrated garlic and cheese. The smell is so strong, you can smell it out of the sealed bottle. And my cat won't willingly eat it, so I have to grind it to dust and toss it into her food.I'll update as time goes on.1) I read somewhere online that this product helps curb flower/grass eating habits in pets. My mom brought home a bouquet of flowers on 4/4/2012, and the first thing my cat did when the flowers were put in a vase was eat them. I'm going to up the dose I've been giving her, and see if that will ease her off of her flower-eating munchies."
1,not complete,"The book is about ancient,medieval and modern times and is nothing for Pellazgians, more then 20 Illyrian Tribes,Dardania, Pannonia, Thrakia, Epiri (Epirus),This is Balkan not only Greece."
1,not quite as advertised,"the disc i received would normally qualify as a ""bonus"" disc on most videos. it only included a boring talking head session with the film makers and a ""star"". it also included a completely lame collection of stills. not the advertised ""adult movies"" mentioned in other reviews. i returned it and was granted a refund. beware"
2,A simple Notebook,"This is excactly what the title means. It is a simple notebook, with some simple drawings and a quotation in every other page. The pages are without lining. It is a useful notebook for receipe writing, but not the most beautiful I have seen, nor the best organised. Simplicity is the word here."
3,Ok for the price,"These batteries are ok - I constantly need AAAs for my universal remote that has special lights, so I go through a lot of these. They do not last as long as the name brands but they are also a lot cheaper with free shipping so that's why I've been buying them. However, since I go through so many of these, I've deciced to invest in rechargeable batteries. Not to mention the hazardous waste that I will reduce with that!"
2,Not What I Ordered,"I ordered Samsung brand ""better"" batteries - I was shipped Samsung Pleomax batteries which show as having a much lower price ($5 less for a pack of 28) and I therefore assume they are of lower quality than the pure Samsung brand. I was NOT charged the lower price, however. Yet Another Example of where Amazon has failed to deliver to me the promise that their system use to inspire in me(I have given up trying to share Amazon Prime with my wife - she just orders as me now)."
1,Bait and switch,"Like another buyer, I received Pleomax batteries rather than the Samsung brand name batteries as displayed. The batteries I received might be good for the price, but the fact is that Pleomax batteries cost less than Samsung. Save some money and order from the Pleomax page instead."
4,PLEOMAX/ by Samsung AAA Batteries: Seem 2 Work as Well as Any-But Now Price 2 High!,"I purchased theseSamsung L3285WDPA3 Alkaline AAA Battery (28 Pack)for $7.82, w/ free amazon shipping last 2/09/09. Yes, they were the unexpected Pleomax(by Samsung) that arrived. But, they worked just fine in all items I've used them in - nearly, if not as, comparable to any other ""high-end, name-brand"" batteries (at least as far as I've noticed). For the price, it was a fantastic bargain! I just came on here to order more... until I saw that the price doubled to $15.72 and only sold by a 3rd party seller who's charging $9.20 for shipping! Too bad. I would definitely recommend them and I'd order again & again, but only if the price came back down, and, either fulfilled or sold by Amazon."
3,Motorway food is the worst in the world.,"This CD is quickly becoming my new found favorite Kinks record. It starts out with Here Comes Yet Another Day with lyrics such as Here comes a new dawn, Here comes a new day, Tune up start to play, Just like any other day. Classic Ray. Of course Ray has a few more food songs such as Maximum Consumption, Hot Potatoes, and Motorway. Then you have your classics like Supersonic Rocket ship and Celluloid Heroes. The live songs on the other half are a hoot with rave-ups of Alcohol and Dave's crunchy guitar on Top of the Pops. Then they throw in Mr. Wonderful, Banana Boat Song, and Baby Face for added measure. A good time is had by all."
3,"3 good books, 1 not-so-good book","I loved ""Aunt Crete's Emancipation"" and ""A Daily Rate,"" both books containing mistreated aunts who still stayed ""Christlike"" throughout the story. ""The Girl From Montana"" is a similar plot to another Grace Livingston Hill book, ""Ladybird,"" in that both books are about young girls who have lost their families in the mountains and go east to find relatives.I agree 100% with the review created by another reader from Utah. I purchased this collection from Avon several months ago, and was very displeased with Isabella Alden's false information about Mormons - I received credit from Avon, but as they didn't want it back, I removed the slanderous Isabella Alden story and ""blacked out"" all references to it elsewhere on the cover. NOW it's a good book."
2,Almost a good guide.,"My wife and I have been using this guide and it's predecessor for about 4 years now. This guide still is our first reference when taking a trip. The first 3 years, eateries were very good and mostly as advertised. Lately, and especially on a recent trip through Nevada, Colorado and Arizona it was hit and miss. Some of the reviews in the book are not up to date regarding the prices and food. We missed on 2 out of the three that we visited. We also figure that we are batting about .500 in our home area, San Francisco. We will continue to use the guide as we really enjoy finding good food on the road and there is little else to help us decide. Maybe a little more personal followup is needed before putting a restaurant in this guide."
2,Useless,"This book reviews restaurants in all 50 states. There where about ten in the northern New England area that would interest me, most I already new about and are well known. Why would I care about a restaurant 2,000 miles away. Pick this up in a store and you can read it, ten minutes and you'll have all the information you need. By the time you travel to all fifty states this will be out of date. It went into my recycling bin."
1,Not comprehensive enough,"Bought this book before a road trip. It proved to be utterly useless to us as we traveled thru NW Arkansas and Missouri. The only restaurants featured for Missouri were concentrated in the two major cities of St. Louis and Kansas City, neither of which we visited. Missouri is a big state and yet only two major cities were covered. What about the rest of the state?? Same was true for Arkansas. Guess if you were going to just visit major cities this book might be useful, but for road trips thru the rest of the country it is pretty useless."
1,If you eat food this book is not for you,"I am a road musician and found this book deeply disappointing. I know most of the towns they pass through and the authors consistently miss the actual food with real local caricature. There taste is for the safe, white, wipe clean menu version of road food. Their web site is a joke. Chowhound or Urbanspoon is a much better resource plus the Roadfood site constantly directs you to a pay service. The book may be a little better than having nothing to help find food on the road that is not from a corporate chain. Trust your instincts. If you get off the freeway looking for one of the places in the book and the place down the block or across the street looks more interesting it probably is."
1,not much new,"I bought this book in the eighties and found it helpful on some road trips. This newer version has little more. Some of these restaurants are no longer good and there are far better ones in an area. The concept is good, but I don't think the Sterns go back to these places to reevaluate and quite frankly I don't think they have added much that's new."
3,Not a bad purchase,"I bought this book, planning my road trip across the US and was excited to start reading it. It's written in an easy, colorful style, short reviews about each of the restaurants.I felt that there should have been photos in the book - how can there not be? The best dish, a nice design, or a pretty view, perhaps.Also, at times it seems that the writers were so excited about being able to eat and get paid for it, that they forget to actually review the food, and instead focus on the whole experience, which is usually a lot more fun when you are a critic."
3,These authors will die young...but VERY HAPPY!,"I bought this book in anticipation of a road trip this summer, and browsed through today. If I weren't familiar with the varied, delicious, and sometimes healthy food America has to offer, I would think we were a country defined by beef, pie, pork, pie, seafood, pie, ice cream, pie, and burritos. Oh, and did I mention pie?I understand: these foods are American, and they are delicious, and they are worth the calories. But...really? After a few Midwestern states, I couldn't keep reading the details. The restaurants served up the same food as everywhere else. I am sure the places are great -- and I look forward to trying some of them -- but I think some variety would greatly enhance the book.I'm worried about the authors, too...so much pork, beef, and PIE...I hope they eat like rabbits when they're not touring!"
4,Travel Companion,"What a great book to bring while you are traveling the United States. Wherever you are, you are sure to open your book and find a reviewed dining experience that emulates the region you are in. I will definitely bring this book along on all my travels."
3,men of color study bible,"Getting the used book is great but, when it has writing in it then it not the same. I had ti white out most of the writing in the bible in order to give it to someone else. I think that you should make sure that writing or love notes be remove from the the books, or let us know and sell it for a lower price. I am not happy with this order."
3,Okay read . . ..,"While the novel starts out good, it soon disappoints. The initial meeting of the hero and the heroine is funny and entertaining. And there are a few more interesting chapters after the first. I felt that at many times Bradford could be a jerk. Caroline cried too much and gave in too easily. She gave new meaning to standing around waiting for a man. The ending is good. I'd borrow it from someone first before purchasing it. It is not typical of Garwood's work. It's one of her earlier ones before her talents truly blossomed."
2,Disappointing! Easily dismissed from memory.,"I've come to expect to be instantly hooked with Ms. Garwood's particular style of writing. However,this is one that's only good for one read. It lacks a certain something that usually gets me involved in the story. If you want her best books try The Lion's Lady and The Bride."
1,Jared & Caroline,"I'm in no way a feminist and I enjoy an arrogant hero, but Jared was totally unlikable. He was arrogant in a mean and condescending way and he stripped the spirit right out of Caroline."
3,Rebellious Desire,"I thought this story started out really well and I liked Bradford and Caroline together. As the story went on Bradford proved to be exceedingly stubborn and unbending regarding his views about women to the point where I was getting really frustrated with him. And though I'm glad he finally saw the light, I still don't really understand his sudden change of heart, other than that the story was drawing to a close and things needed to be wrapped up. Caroline was wonderful and I felt a little sorry for her that she had to put up with Bradford's past baggage. The subplot about Caroline's cousin, Charity, was awesome, and I wish we could have seen more of Caimen. If a sequel had been written for this book, I would have been interested in reading a story about Caimen, Bradford's friend Milford, or perhaps even Benjamin. There were so many wonderful characters in this story."
4,Sweet and cute historical romance,"Rebellious Desire was extremely cute. I enjoyed Caroline's character, she was strong and definitely put the handsome, stubborn Bradford in his place. The storyline was sweet, sassy, and romantic.I have never come across a Julie Garwood book I disliked, she has wonderful writing style. If you enjoy historical romance, she is an author to look up and try out."
2,Dissapointing,"This book was definetly NOT up to the usual Garwood standards. I admit I grew to hate Jered (the leading male character) more than love him. I enjoy Garwood's other male charcaters, with their dark, brooding, protective attitudes, but this guy was just mean! Overall it was very dissapointing. I expect better from Julie."
1,Just Awful!,Julie Garwood is an exceptional story teller and has a wonderful talent for describing relationships in her Scottish novels and I loved reading each and every one of them. It was difficult to believe the same author wrote this book. The characters of Caroline and Bradford were so loaded down with endless internal subject chatter it wasn't possible to feel they were real characters. Tons of mindless filler and no story. Simply awful.
2,Rebellious Desire? Hardly!,"This story was slow, uninspiring, and hardly sensuous, desirous, or entertaining. The characters are lifeless and the story, boring. Don't waste your time. If you want truly wonderful historical fiction novels, go to Judith McNaught. Any of her historical fiction novels are worlds better than this one."
2,rebellious desire?...where!? where IS IT!?,"This novel was intriguing in the beginning but slowly dimmed towards the end. I wished Ms Garwood would have brought up a notch the chemistry between the main characters. BRADFORD JERED MARCUS BENTON is as arrogant as he is STIFF! Caroline is, or at least BECAME, nothing but a WIMP pretending to be brave. Overall, a dissatisfying and predictable story.SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT!great reads by Ms. Garwood are ""Ransom""(the best of all), ""heartbreaker,"" ""come the spring,"" and ""mercy"""
2,Can get tedious,"I like the beginning and the plot, but the story is not as well-developed as it can be. At some places, the story can even get tedious and boring, and I thought the author could've done better, given such a good storyline. I think the back cover describes a story that I expected to be more exciting."
1,book tooo small,I originally saw this bk in the library and was thrilled that Amazon carried it. Was shocked to see how small in size it actually is and the illustrations are miniscule. Sorry. am returning it. Where's the large edition with colored illustrations???
4,Great cooler but too tall,"I installed it on a p8400 on a GIGABYTE GA-EP45-UD3P motherboard in a Coolermaster Wavemaster case. It does a great job of cooling the CPU, I've overclocked the P8400 to 3.8GHz, with sys_basher putting a maximum load on both cores, the core temps are 37C.The one problem with this cooler is the height, it's 3/4"" too tall for the Coolermaster case. With the cooler installed it's impossible to put the side panel on the case."
5,The best of all,"The Thermalright Ultra 120 extreme is simply the best air cooler, I compared with some other coolers like the Thermaltake Big Typhoon and the Asus Silent Knight (note tha both are 100% cooper), the CoolerMaster Aquagate S1 and none of them are as effective as the Thermaltake. How ever it's not perfect, there are some details like the size and the weight(actually you must understand it is necessarily), it comes without a fan (i recommend you a 120 mm Scythe Sflex), and the retention brackets isn't quite good (it doesn't move from its place, however you can turn it a little). If you are looking for the best air cooler, this is it!"
5,Sales Clerk turned Flight Attendant!,"After returning from maternity leave I wanted a new career change and a job that would give me more time off. Working in retail for over 8 years I had always dreamed of becoming a flight attendant, but I wasn't quite sure what the requirements were. After reading this book it really helped me prepare. It was easy to read, not too lenghty and was straight to the point. I especially liked the sample tests, and interviewing tips like the do's and dont's at the Open House such as making sure that pagers and cell phones are turned off during an interview because it's disruptive and arriving early because seating is limited. I recently attended an interview with Northwest Airlines and was selected for a training date in March 2001. I couldn't believe it! At the interview I was amazed at the number of people that were there. I had no idea it was so competitive. This book helped a lot! Thanks"
4,Blow Dryer,Love the fact that this dryer is a little lighter in weight than the original one that I also have. It does not seem to have the same drying power as the original.. I keep this one in my travel bag for that reason..It is easy on the hair and does not seem to frizz out the hair as some brands seem to do all the time..
2,BAD RECORDING,"This album provides one of the only recordings of Galliard Sonata No. 1, but it is played poorly. His technique is not good (he slides between pitches), and the interpretation of the piece is quite odd. After all, it is a Baroque piece of music, but he plays it as if it were a Romantic or Modern piece. His excessive use of vibrato is quite distracting. Overall, this cd is quite disappointing."
1,bad,"u send me the wrong cd, it was dread, but not Mikey Dread, it was a rock garage band, the worst rock band ever. So i need u to send me the right cd."
4,A Quick Mystery,"Though I had no idea what I was sending to my kindle, I thought I would take a chance because this book is FREE! I was pleasently surprised by the story- and I enjoyed it thoroughly. It is the tale of a young woman trying to piece together her life and find her father's murderer after suffering from acute memory loss. The reader is drawn in as the character rediscovers her past and the mystery that surrounds her father's death and the nature of his killer. I would highly suggest it - an easy quick read."
5,Brilliant book,"Ben Hecht lived so many fascinating lives: a Chicago newspaperman in the wild days, a Hollywood screenwriter (check out his credits on IMDB -- its amazing), a flim-flammer during the Florida land boom, a foreign correspondent in Weimar Germany, and later, a figure in the creation of Israel. And he's a crisp, unsentimental writer who knows how to tell a story. This book should not be out of print. I've read it twice and won't loan my copy to anyone."
1,please don't waste your money,Full of bugs. Doesn't work with current itunes (duh!) Unforgivable to put this piece of crap out with a price tag on it. Would be too expensive as freeware. 1 star is too generous!
1,Worst Piece of Software Ever,"This is the worst piece of software that I have ever owned (including shareware/freeware). This is the 2nd product I have purchased by Griffin Technology (the other was the microphone for iPods). They have both been pieces of junk.This software is buggy, constantly crashed, diificult to add stations to record, etc. Avoid this product."
5,"A dark, well-written novel of murder and mystery.","Mr. Cooke is one of my favorite authors and for a good reason: he writes an excellent story! In this one, the first-person character, Jesse James Colton, arrives in Isthmus City [a Manhattan-like city in Wisconsin], a place referred to by bigots as ""Fairyland of the Dairyland"", and immediately gets himself into serious danger after he murders a transvestite who tries to force sex upon him. After hiding the body in a dilapidated old house, he is later raped by a truck-driver, and then out of curiosity calls a number he finds on a bathroom wall at the bus station. The series of events that follow seem to convince him that he is being haunted by his deceased victim and that his action will be discovered. Mr. Cooke's story is very intricate and constantly interesting. The ending is a bit surprising, and I won't spoil it here. Read it. Just read it, and you won't be sorry."
2,'Sweeper' a Mess,"The whole time I was reading ""The Chimney Sweeper"" I found myself wishing John Peyton Cooke had just gone ahead and wrote the gay porno novel he's obviously itching to write. As it is, we're kept well apprised of main character Jesse James Colson's physical attributes, his genitalia in particular. Still, I was willing to suspend disbelief. But when Jesse improbably becomes a policeman and manages to get his police blues in cotton rather than the standard issue polyester by feigning an allergy to man-made fiber, I stopped even trying to take this book seriously. (Cooke takes it further by having Jesse alter his uniforms so they accentuate his Tom of Finland bod.) ""The Chimney Sweeper"" does have a compelling story, and I kept reading despite its increasing ridiculousness with each chapter. Compared to Cooke's far-superior novel ""Torsos,"" ""Sweeper"" is a mess."
2,"Improbable, downbeat read","While this story has some interesting plot twists and good discription of time and place, it's too improbable to become all that compelling. It involves a former teenage runaway who becomes a homeless hood committing street crimes, then becomes a police officer in a fictional Wisconsin city (apparently, a combination of Milwaukee and Madison). People with backgrounds like that don't become policemen. In fact, most have college degrees in law enforcement and/or criminal justice, and have to go through the police acedemy. And that's just the most glaring example. There are too many lapses of logic for me to reccomend this book."
2,maybe useful for a sun visor but not for bath,"I can't use it for bath because it leaked water unless tighten enough my baby's head hurt.It can be a sun visor but not during hot day. It makes my baby sweat.And BEWARE: if you want to RETURN it, you MUST,1. All returns must be in unopened and in resalable condition. Packaging must not be damaged and manufacturer seals must be intact.2. Shipping charges for returned items are the responsibility of the buyer, new shipping charges may apply if applicable.3. All returns are subject to a 15% restocking fee.This product is not from Amazon, but from third party seller, Caterpillar Kids."
5,Background to the German Wars,"I don't disagree with the previous reviewer. The book deals mostly with the Prussian preparation for war. For more detailed accounts of the actual fighting, read Geoffrey Wawro's books on the Austro-Prussian and the Franco-Prussian wars."
2,Copy Machine Book,"This is apparently a copy of the original book. In the other 4 books I have, the photo section is printed in color on glossy paper. This book has black and grey photos that look like they were photocopied. Only the cover looks like the original. A bait-&-switch if you ask me."
1,Item received was not as described,"The item I received from Amazon is not what is described here. Despite the banner on the front of this book and in the image stating ""8 pages of color photographs"", the photos were very poor quality black and white photocopies. This was true for all 3 of the Babylon 5 season books that had photos. I am not even convinced that the text in any of the 5 books is not just photocopy as well. I paid full cover price and purchased directly from Amazon. After sending a complaint and asking how to get the correct item, Amazon immediately sent another set. These too were defective black and white photocopies. Although the book itself appears to be interesting, I would buy it from a book store and not purchase it unseen through Amazon."
1,Please don't waste your money,"Please, dont waste your money on this book. I read it from cover to cover just hoping that there might be a plot, but alas this book was filled with nothing but silly conversation that just left me yawning. This book felt like the middle two boring chapters of an even more boring novel. Like I said, please dont waste your hard earned money on ill coneived book."
3,Title a Misnomer,"Much as I've enjoyed Dr. John's music, this album was a bit of a disappointment. I love his New Orleans and swamp jazz but this album is heavy on modern jazz and is not his regular band. The title ""Funky New Orleans"" is, in my opinion, misleading. The emphasis is on ""funky"" rather than ""New Orleans"". The introduction, of Indian chanting, is distracting at best. I wish I'd ordered a different CD with his usual style!"
3,"Teetering on edge of great at times, but it never gets there","Marshall has authority on the subject and I believe that she, and her characters, know jazz. Her characters are carefully constructed--maybe too carefully. This book was very predictable because of the labored construction. The writing was satisfactory, and displayed a knowledge of jazz and character development but it took no risks. There were no breathtaking passages. At best, the writing was good, but at most times it was only a mediocre vehicle for delivering a story that, because of its predictability, needed the writing to be cranked up a notch."
1,Disappointing,"He gives many references to a cd-rom that does not come with the book. McGraw-Hill's customer service says they don't show a cd-rom for this book, and author's email addresse is a bad address.Very frustrated and disappointed about having bought an unworthy book."
5,Very hard to get in Pakistan - but worth it,I got this book while on a business trip to the United States and I found it to be one of the best technical books I've ever found.I rate books by how much I learn from them. Mr. Myke Predko's book taught me a lot and helped me to better understand programming and electronics. (...)
1,disappointing:dated and padded with IBM PC details,"I purchased this book twice. It references a CD containing code, macros, data sheets, and applications for the book. The CD was nowhere to be found. I contacted McGraw Hill who said return it, so I did. I ordered it from Amazon and it arrived, again without the CD. The CD is neither shipped with the book nor available from McGraw Hill nor the web. Predko's web site does not have anything related to the book and his email bounces.This book is very dated, written in 2000. I was disappointed with the lack of modern PIC information and surprised to find PC filler included. If I wanted a book on Visual Basic or the PC 16450 UART or other PC details, I would have purchased a PC book.This book was not what I expected."
1,1184+ PAGES OF WORTHLESS B.S.!,The best I can say about the book is that the paper has about the same consistency as the Sears-Roebuck catalog of years past.
2,Great content marred by bad organization and writing,"Myke Predko has a thorough knowledge of electronics, computers, and programming, so he is more than qualified to teach others the tools and tricks he has learned and developed over the years. Unfortunately, his conversational style does not work here because this complex material is not presented in a well organized fashion. Myke, for the third edition please collaborate with a writer or two; and a proofreader."
3,Riddled with typos,"I'm new to microcontrollers, so I'll defer technical judgement until I finish the book - or at least get further along.However, one thing I find disturbing is the extremely poor editing. I'm only on page 60 and I'm finding numerous grammatical and typing/printing errors - nearly one on every other page. For example: the page headings for a section on ""simulation"" are ""sTimulation"". There are examples of phrases where ""or"" was replaced with ""of"", and there are paragraphs containing multiple sentence fragments. In short it looks like the ""editor"" limited his review to running a spell checker, and even then failed to pay attention to what words the spell checker was replacing.Perhaps these are minor issues, but it makes the book difficult to read, and one wonders if the technical content is as poorly edited."
2,Reads like an encyclopedia,"A noble effort but too broad of a subject. He covers a lot of material. However, it appears superficial to me because much of it does not provide examples of practical implementations of PIC special features and configurations, so you left knowing about it, but you don't know how to implement it in real world applications.The book is good if you are interested in getting some knowledge of PIC Assembler. However, if you are a beginner, get a book on PIC Basic and use that language.No CD, author's website does not have a download of the book's code, and his email is a bad address."
2,Full of useful information as a reference,"This book is not for someone who already understands how a computer works. It is confusing, and in no way can hold your attention for more than a paragraph. The descriptions of the PIC architecture are vague and poorly drawn. It was much easier to understand how the Microchip line works just by reading their manuals. If Mr. Predko really holds this level of relationship with this line of products then he is to be commended, because it is outside the realm of practical use. All this aside, it really is useful for some small code snippets and practical interfacing. Just for that it is worth the money. Don't count on the book to actually deliver insight on the machines operation."
3,Not a primer,"When you consider the vast majority of microcontroller books, most assume that you have a good background in embedded design - this book was no exception. I can honestly say that there is no such thing as a microcontroller primer. I have only seen an online reference that guides you from microcontroller fundamentals to coding real-time OS'. Just stick to online references. This book is great for professional coders."
5,A vast cornucopia of ideas and info on PICS,"I have been using the book for the last 7 months , pretty much as my sole reference . It comes with a CD_ROM and circuit board for a PIC programmer , which makes it a great value . Myke usually goes out of his way , in his writing , to explain things in several different ways to ensure clarity . As a beginner , I found I could immediately start writing small usefull programs . I am now creating a fairly complex project for work . Although I still consider myself pretty much a beginner , I would highly recommend this book for experts and beginners alike . Both beginning and advanced topics are presented here , along with a wealth of valuable experience . 5 stars !"
5,Over 1000 Pages of details without any filler or padding,"This book is full of facts, examples and detailed discussions of everything PIC. Need to interface you PIC chip to external serial EEPROM, RS-232 connection, or that dreaded LCD display.. Then have no fear; Myke has it all covered for you. Have one of the chips without the required interface you need. don't worry, Myke shows you how to simulate it with bit banging techniques.As to the El Cheapo programmer which has the PCB included in the book. R5 is 10k ohm. R2 should be 1k to work with more computers (or so myke says on his web site). R3, and R4 are 1k ohm; U3's part number is more likely 214-3339-00-602R."
