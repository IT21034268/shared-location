2,"Would be nice, but picture is blurry","I had this KVM switch for a few days - it has all the regular features that other KVM switches have, for a good price. Housing is metal, unlike some other plastic switches, and it looks good.However, my main gripe with it was that even with excellent quality cable sets, the picture on the monitor was blurry. I couldn't stand it... had to get a Linksys instead that has no such problem.Oh, and one more thing: you need cables that are different than the regular KVM switch cables. For some reason, this uses male-male monitor plugs, unlike most other KVM switches, that need male-female connectors."
4,Perfect for musicians..,"Contrary to the poor comment below, the Fostex is quite easy to use; one must of course read the manual! It does everything it claims and quite well. For those who are hesitant about buying such a ""complicated"" piece of machinery, I suggest reading the manual and going through each function to learn how to properly use the machine. Doing thus, you will be rewarded greatly, knowing how to tap all the great features this machine possesses."
2,Not for cavemen,-I have read and went through the manual while using it and still haven't managed to record anything. It is complicated for those of us who just wish to press a button and record then press another button to burn a CD. I have figured out how to listen to myself playing on it though so thats a start. I am starting to think they sent the wrong manual for it. A friend of mine who was brought up around such items is going to hopefully show me how it works in a couple days after that I will edit this review.
5,the magic chrismas treasure,I'm a collectionist of christmas album. At the moment I have more than 50different christmas compilation. I think that Narada Christmas collectionis once the better disk for music selection and very high sound quality.Listenig this album is the good manner to appreciate the magic christmas treasure.
5,Truly beautiful Christmas music,"This 2 CD set was a lovely addition to my Christmas season this year. I like that most of the songs on the CD are familiar carols, and there is plenty of variety in the instrumental styles, so there's a little something for everyone!"
4,Review of the best of Narada Christmas,I have been looking for this collection for a long time. I was very pleased when I discovered most of my favorite Christmas music was covered. The Narada Christmas album was a highlight of my Christmas season.
3,Nice Lady,"For every Warner Brothers classic like CASABLANCA, there's dozens of Warners ""B"" movies that no one has ever heard of. This 1942 crime melodrama is one of them. Framed for a robbery, Faye Emerson is sent to women's prison; then, like her male counterparts in movies like this, she breaks out and tries to clear her name. This enjoyable, compact little picture moves so rapidly (running less than an hour) that you barely have time to mull over the illogical chain of events. Ultimately, however, the film's most memorable aspect is the appearance of young supporting cast member Jackie Gleason, a decade before his television immortality."
3,"Good, but incomplete","Good places to eat are hard to find. Finding an edible alternative to McDonalds or TGI Fridays is a must for long road trips. This book offers a list of good eats when you're a stranger in a strange land. The picks are generally pretty good although with I have encountered a few restaurants where I walked out wanting to write a stern letter to the Roadfood editors. But generally if it's in the book, it's a good meal.The main problem is that the book is mainly city centric, and is a finite work. There are some cities, and large pieces of states that have no entries at all. And if you know an area well, you may disagree on which restaurants they should have.Overall a nice book. If you use the roadfood web site, it has more listings."
2,Dissapointed,"Used the original ""Road Food"" about twelve years ago. We did a Southern States cross country and ""Road Food"" added wondrfully to our adventure; little Mexican Restaurants, crayfish, fried chicken, gumbo, sausage and seafood shacks. What great fun. We are anticpating another Southern journey this coming spring and looked forward to using the new version of ""Road Food"" to, again, enhance our trip. Got it five days ago and was very dissapointed that it is, now, almost entirely a barbecue catalogue. Not a lot beyond barbecue. Too bad. We'll have to look for the information we're after on the internet."
4,Haven't tried the food but loving the book,"We haven't been able to try any of the recommended food yet (but are hoping to very soon), but we're enjoying the book!! Good writing style and I like the layout. Only complaint at this point, so many of the midwestern resturants are in major cities -- what about places off-the-beaten-path???"
2,500 restaurants..and all of them serving the same things!,"ROAD FOOD just doesn't do it for me. Each synopsis seems to be a repeat of the previous one depending on the region. Sticking pretty much to the main highways and spending far too much time in the big cities (8 places in Pittsburgh alone) the repetitious style starts to wear thin. In NJ (My home state) you are pretty much limited to subs and hot dogs. This is repeated throughout the book, lobster roll and clams in New England, BBQ and fried food in the south, you get the picture. Occasionally peppered throughout are a few personal commentaries about the people and places, but I think this could have been a more useful guide by focusing on fewer places with more detail. The summary says you should carry it with you, but its size keeps it from being a good traveling companion, especially considering its narrow culinary focus. While not a total waste of time for the road food adventurer, it is so much less than it could have been."
2,Excellent resource for learning about regional cuisine.,"I drove around the country in 1987 and used this book extensively. Very helpful. I like its format better than Roadfood.(a newer edition - Harper Perennial.1992) Many of the restaurants in the book are now closed, so don't rely on it. Refer to it when travelling but always call ahead."
1,Worst... book... ever!,"This book sums up the rantings of a possible obsessive-compulsive person. I bet she has changed assignments many times, because some of her ""advice"" are serious career-limiting moves. I wonder if she has any little rituals to go to the water fountain (get the second paper glass, not the first, but not before having sanitized it first with her own antibacterial wipes brought from home. Test the water temperature with her own thermometer, and do not drink it until it reaches 70 degrees).If you just got a temp assignment and you want to get rid of it fast, buy this book."
3,I like these but...,"I like these but you need a few repeats to whiten your teeth. However, it is very mild on my gums and teeth. I don't feel sensitivity after each use."
2,Captivating yet overly simplified,"I was one of the many lucky enough not only to read this book but have the text analyzed in a classroom setting by the author himself. In this text Dr. Dicker displays his extensive knolwedge of the subject at hand. Yet in doing so he shows a tendancy to over analyze Descartes meditations eventually making anything beyond the original text segments very laborious reading, although I would recomend the book for the purpose it was intended for in my case; a very methodical introduction to basic philosophy."
4,classical,"very well written text about the algebra of standard model,but not for beginers,a very solid background in particle physicsand symmetry methods for physics is required"
3,So-so,"There aren't many books out there which treat practical group theory techniques as used by particle physicists. This book is an admirable attempt to fill a void, but it's a bit thin unfortunately."
2,Mediocre,"Georgi's book has its strengths and weaknesses. It is very strong on application to physics but suffers greatly from a lack of mathematical substance. It has all the earmarks of a mathematics book written by a physicist: lots of physical insight but poor logical structure. Clear definitions and statements of theorems are missing and contribute to the nebulous feel of the text.This is the kind of book that a casual reader will go through and think he has learned alot but for which the serious student who seeks a precise, thorough understanding of the material will likely end up confused at many points. It is a book of tools. The reader will not obtain a mastery of the subject but must suppliment this book with other, more theoretical treatments of representation theory.The lack of mathematical rigor is by design as Geogi mentions in the preface. It could have been a better book, in my opinion, had it been more fleshed out in that respect."
5,I love this show!!!!!,"I love this show, it was one of the best family shows. I can not wait until I get my copy, you can not find it anywhere on TV. So excited!!!!"
3,It is the show we remember,"My wife got this, I won't watch it but she does love it. Streaming through Prime is good across our 1mb DSL connection. Same show it was twenty some odd years ago."
5,Eight is enough,"Eight is Enough was my favorite show back in the 70's, I would be one of the first to buy the DVD set if it were to come out. So please put eight is enough on DVD. The Bradfords have always been my favorite TV family.Cathy Brown (Ozone Park, NY)"
5,Yay!! Finally Eight is Enough on DVD,I was so thrilled to find out the first season is coming out on DVD in Apr. I agree with another viewer who states they should put season 1 out and season 2 since season 1 there is only 7 episodes. I hope this is the beginning of all the seasons being out on DVD and not like Who's the Boss. Where season 1 was available on DVD and then that was it. No more. We supported these Stations by watching the show for the five seasons it was on TV and they made millions of dollars. The least they can do for us fans is make the full series available on DVD. Can't wait to get my first DVD.
4,Eight is Enough Pilot,Excellent show!!!!! Amazing to see Mark Hamil pre-Star Wars as the original David. So wonderful to have access to these classic episodes again. Looking forward to future seasons!
5,Not on DVD yet?,"Somebody has really dropped the ball on this one. This show was an important part to so many people in the 70's, that it is inconceivable that no one has figured that out yet."
5,Its about time!!!,"I loved the fact that they released season 1....But its a tease because there's only nine episodes! And, the best of the series it yet to come. The series imo really picks up in season 2! I hope they don't stop with season 1....."
4,eight is enough,This brought back memories of watching it on tv. It is worth watching again and again. Looking forward for the Rest of All The Complete Seasons thru Amazon.com
2,Sharing,Slow to send product.Does not communicate enough.Needs to let customers know more in advance when shipping.Ship when you tell customer
1,no list of what this book contains,Do you expect us to buy every ragtimebook in order to find a certain piece? Please add a list to your webpages where it says what musical pieces your scorebooks contain. Thank you.
2,Picture and description INCORRECT,"The LS-ADAT is a computer card not for the Aurora; the one pictured on the site is the LT-ADAT and it is a supplementary card for the Lynx Aurora. The LS version is a good supplementary card (not stand-alone) for several Lynx Studio audio cards, however the Lynx technical writing is possibly the worst out there. That carries over to the fit within the operating platform you are using. This is truly arcane and not acceptable plug & play; what you see is NOT what you get. Can you make it work, sure. Is it a cheap way to get ADAT and ASIO channels to mix,yes. Is it fun, HA! User-friendly, HA HA!! Audio performance from Lynx is excellent and this card does not affect that performance in any way. If you already have a Lynx LS audio card and you are needing ADAT I/O go for it."
5,"Beautiful Bracelet, Beautiful Price","The Fancy Jasper Bracelet by ""Cute Stretchey Gems"" is amazing in it's variety of colors and patterns. It exibits a good example of the of the different types of Jasper used for jewelry. It fits a 7"" wrist very comfortably."
4,Guide to Annuals,The Guide to the Annuals arrived in fine shape and was just what I was looking for. It also arrived quicker than I expected!Creighton Drury
4,good product but..,I think these suckers were used before I got them. The box had bunch of scratches and small dents on jacks made me think I wasnt the first one to use them.
1,Sloppy welding.,"The product looks sturdy and strong when looked at from the outside of it, but once you look on the inside of the stands the poor welding becomes very obvious. The pieces of metal are only welded on one side (the inside) when it should be done on both sides, and the work is rough, almost cracked looking and filled with holes. I definitely would not feel comfortable having the stands hold up my Corolla. I uploaded some photos of what the welds look like right out of the box so you can judge for yourself."
3,"Work well, but do not inspire confidence.","I have not had any issues with these, but every time I use them I wonder how many more times I'll be able to. They just don't look/feel real well made. Unfortunately, the ones that _do_ look nice are quite a bit more money. So just check them over before getting under your car and you'll probably be fine. It is nice that they are double locking."
4,nice jack stands,"good floor jack stands. Work well. Lift height was not as high as I hoped, but was as advertised. well built"
1,I returned it because,"the first time I used it out of the box, one stand's neck is broken. I decided this brand is the one I should avoid. And let my friend know it."
5,good,They arrived fast and do the job. I bought them for my boyfriend and he said they are sturdy enough to not feel nervous under them!
5,2 ton jack stands,"Excellant quality! The welds are good and the pins slide in and out perfectly! With free shipping and no sales tax, these are a great bargain. They are 12.1"" high, so make sure you have clearence to put them under your jacked up vehicle."
2,pedestrian - good detail but poor vision and lousy read,"The first time I've ever returned a book that I bought from Amazon. I should learn to avoid books that try to mingle two hot topics - they are usually not the best in either. It reads like a tape recording of someone trying to teach an avid beginner - cinema verite - step by step, key by key. With occassional lapses into first person naratives, on such subjects as the trials and tribulations of his early efforts to download and use Latex. If you are looking for a detailedhand-holding lesson (especially if you are trying to work with Emacs) this book might be exactly what you are looking for. Not me. I look good reads, conceptual overviews, sweeping grasp of the vision. This book was way too boring for me."
5,Awesome Car Washing Tool,"Terrific product, had my doubts about the spot free rinse and no drying but this product works! Case is nice so you can store the unit."
1,WASTED MY MONEY!!!,I used only 3-4 times and it doesn't clean as good as it advertised!!! WHAT A WAST OF MONEY!!!
2,"The soap leaves a film on your car, Still have to dry","I do not know how anyone can say this product works. The commercials show a man using the product on a black sports car, and it dries like new. I have a black Cobalt and used this product for the first time today, in the shade, and in 74 degree weather. I followed to instructions exactly and after rinsing I noticed the soap had left a white film all over my car! The water was drying spotless but the soap wasn't. The water also wasn't drying ""before my eyes"" either. I still had to end up going over my car with a cloth to remove the soap film. After I use all this I will not be buying a refill, if I even use it again. Luckily this was a gift or it would be going back to the store!"
4,Very nice,"I used this to replace an old leaking sunroof in my jeep's hard top. Function is great. Only thing to concider is either get the sun shade from the manufacturer or you will need to make one. In full sun in the summer, it gets real hot under the glass, even with A/C on full blast you can feel the heat coming thru."
2,"Not quite as good as his follow-up cd ""Sleight Of Hand""","This is an interesting slice of metal in the vein of early Metallica or Megadeth, but not anywhere near as fantastic as the mind-blowing, mostly jaw-dropping instrumental effort that followed it, ""Sleight Of Hand"". The cool thing about this cd is that you can hear the technical groundwork that Guy was laying down preceding his masterful follow-up. His fret-burning skill improved by leaps and bounds by the time he was ready to record ""Sleight Of Hand"". Check that out whether or not you like this cd...if you are a fan of Satch, Vai, Van Halen or Beck....Guy and his band play with more full-speed-ahead raw punk-metal energy and passion than I think I've ever heard a 3-piece deliver."
3,Pretty but ..,This shoes are very sexy and goes well with day and night events. The only thing is first few times you wear this pair it will hurt the back of your foot and you can get blisters like i did. I think it is because at the back it is so hard that it needs to be worn out to become comfy. But other than that they are really pretty.
3,Cheap and relatively functional if you don't ask too much,"First of all, don't expect that you can use this case as a clip-on holder for anything more athletic than brisk walking. While the clip does hold on well, it's so small that my iPod bounced up and down off of my leg like a kangaroo with every step. Secondly, the case provides protection of the iPod click wheel to the point that the wheel itself does not function well under the case. Once I removed that part of the case with a razor blade, it was much easier to use.In summation, the price is good, but the case is average. If you're just walking with it or looking for a bit of protection, it'll work. If you demand anything more, look elsewhere."
5,Powerful,"Here is an overwhelming book on an overwhelming artist. I was speechless when I saw the exhibit, and I remained so when I opened the catalogue. A definite must-have. The book is a comprehensive survey of Smith's career with an in-depth look at his series (especially notable is the uncompleted Cubi series, large-scale works which, due to their size, are rarely seen together and which constitute the apex of the artist's work).High-quality reproductions (seldom the case with books dealing with sculpture), breakthrough texts...too bad you can't touch the works!"
2,"10 minute book, no revelations","I'm a day trader and trade stocks, ETF's, and options. I always looking for new ideas to help me screen for ""buy candidates."" I thought this book might have some new twist on technical indicators. When I opened it up, I was disappointed. I literally read the book, cover to cover in 10 minutes. I went though it quickly because the material was so simple. Basically the theory in the book is as follows: 6 phases of a stock. Recovery Phase (50SMA < 200SMA, Close > 50SMA), Accumulation phase (Close > 50SMA, Close > 200SMA, 50SMA < 200 SMA),etc.... same simple concept for the other four phases. Then for the grand finale,the last chapter ""Putting it all together""...drum roll.... Was a review of the previous six chapters.. happy holidays."
3,"For beginners, maybe...","Unfortunately, this book did absolutely nothing for me. I've read many books on the subject, from authors such as Weinstein, O'Neil, Elder, Tharp, Link, Morris, Livermore, and many more. If you're an absolute beginner, then you may find it interesting, but still, it seems like there are so many texts out there (from the above authors mentioned) that are simply much better.I gave the book 3 stars because I was not able to get very far into the material, and I don't think that it would be fair for me to give the book a bad rating if I did not read it in its entirety. Still, the fact that I was not able to get very far says it all.Bottom line: I have to recommend a book by Stan Weinstein (Secrets for Profiting in Bull or Bear Markets) over this one."
4,Cool Book on Special Forces JTF2 Delta Force SAS et al,"Lots of information on SOF units in Iraq and Afghanistan, this book reads well and is jammed with pretty interesting photos. It includes almost 100 images including never before seen photos of Canada's Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2) in Afghanistan (which for me as a Canadian was worth the price of the book). Also included are pics of JTF2 Hummers and mountain operations,descriptions of their operations as well as Navy SEALs, Grom and a large chapter on the Aussie SAS (who come across really well as no-nonsense professionals.) There is also a good blow by blow account of the Moscow raid against Chechen terrorists in 2002. Up to date and worth the price."
4,Shadow Wars: Special Forces in the New Battle Against Terrorism,"This is one of those books that the so called main stream media journalists in the ""green zone"" should read before they ever leave the US. At a minimum it would spark them to get away from their peers and pursue stories like those filed by Micheal Yon. These are not the same old ""bad news stories from Iraq"" as seen on the main-stream ""news"" channels."
2,Pretty dry stuff -- A real slog,"I purchased this item sight unseen, based upon the website hype and the fact that it was in the bargain bin. Not at all what I expected. Pretty academic with a sociologist's focus on rituals and belief. 23 'Secret Societies' each receive about 10 pages of treatment. Half of each essay is devoted to the specifics of 'initiation rituals' in each sect, the other half to lore related to the sect or the sect's place in history. The author's thesis is that, throughout history, all secret society initiation rites are very similar and are all about 'brainwashing'. Pretty wide coverage including: the Assassins, Knights Templar, Sufi, Gnostics, Witches, Rosicrucians, and Tongs. Some of my other favorite sects/cults are missing. Also missing (despite the books academic patina) are footnotes. However, there IS an Index. The original copyright of this book is 1961. I read a 1998 reprint published by MJF books."
1,Buy at Home Depot for $21!,I just bought this EXACT product at Home Depot for $21. What is this vendor thinking? RIP OFF!!!
2,Disappointed,"Extremely thin mirrors, I was expecting them to be somewhat thicker. I ordered 3 boxes of these for a project and they arrived cracked and chipped and the seller refused to replace the box and would only refund me $10 which was nothing compared to the $140 I spent for a project that I couldn't finish. All I really wanted was for the broken tiles to be replaced and they were not able to do so. I would not purchase through this seller again as I also had another issue at the same time of this order regarding a table which they listed as having a door and to my disappointment arrived with no door."
5,Got a screenplay? Buy this book now!,"This is a how-to book that is as informative as it is entertaining. There are bookshelves full of screenwriting how-to books, but this rare volume tells you how to market and sell yours. It's an insider guide to Hollywood and off-Hollywood that will save you the pain of years of trial and error. Kouguell, an experienced screenwriter and script doctor, has drawn on her own experience, as well as the expertise of players from Miramax to Paramount, to show you how to polish your submission, write a killer query letter, hone your synopsis and pitch, pitch, pitch. Screenwriters: Read this book before you write another word!"
3,Not appropriate for high-school,"The concept of this book is great--already prepared information gap activities for all different levels. Unfortunately, most of the tasks are too difficult for Spanish I and II high-school students, and there are a few phrases/expressions taught which are not appropriate for the age group. Also, it uses some very low frequency vocabulary in some of the activities. There are a few brilliant activities, but it is more of a book for 2nd or 3rd semester college students, and has little to offer the HS teacher."
1,dvd case,Very nice piece of furniture EXCEPT one side was missing the holes needed to insert the pegs which hold the shelves. Pretty poor quality control I would say. For one side of the piece to be usable I have to get out my drill to make the necessary holes. Hope I can fix the problem.
4,Still learning,"I am still learning to use this calculator. I think it will be great when shopping for fabric. I am new to quilting, so I think this will help a lot."
3,It is just ok,"Since the late 60's I have been a great fan of The Foundations and have purchased several 45's from them. The selection is really good and covers most of the hits from the group. Nevertheless, as I am familiar to the original recordings on singles and LPs, I have to say I got quite disappointed with the sound I heard from the CD. If you just want to know the songs of the group then you will enjoy it, but if you already know them, what you will hear will not sound as you expected. It is just OK."
5,Great product,Bought the Sun glasses along with the Clear Saftely glasses for my brother's birthday. He does a lot of work around the house. Since these are bifocals he no longer has to take the saftely glasses off to read instructions.
4,Good Product,I have to frequently go into an automotive shop attached to the store I work in and safety glasses are required. Unfortunately I also need reading glasses to see fine print these days. These were the perfect solution. They function as regular safety glasses but if I need to read some fine print while in the shop I just look through the bottom section and I can see small numbers and letters. The price was great too!
1,Not as advertised,"These are not reading glasses, they are bifocals.They have a small area of the lens which has the visual adjustment.If you need them for working on anything that takes up your whole visual field they are useless.Furthermore, when I returned them because they were not as specified, Amazon changed my reason for return from ""Not as Ordered"" to ""Delivered Late"" and charged me for shipping."
3,Comfy and Hip,"BB shoes are the only shoes that fit me well and do not hurt my feet. The Bendix also fits well and is very comfortable but is not quite as sturdy as some of my previous BB shoes. The shoe is very flexible, it works from slightly less formal wear to nights on the town. It is just a bit too on the stylish side for formal work situations and a bit edgy for the morning coffee or bagel run."
3,A little disappointing..but get it!,"I HAVE to get all the ""Frasier"" seasons...this one is not as gut-funny..but..it's showing more emotional maturity and growth..it is a DIFFERENT kind of comedy...definetly for adults...so..when you're in the mood for wit and dry humor and intelligence..this is the show for you. I just love David Hyde Pierce and Kelsey Grammar..and all the characters entanglements and very HUMAN, REALISTIC lives."
1,FORCED Commercials At Start of Disk 1!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I hate this! Will NEVER buy any more Frasier DVD sets, NOT when I am FORCED to sit through several minutes of commercials for other TV series!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Same thing happens on my season 4, only fewer commercials. By now they're probably doing it to all the seasons. Avoid this set!"
3,Love Frasier but what about Captions/subtitles,"Absolutely love the entire Frasier series but I do not understand why they continue to not include captions for hard of hearing people.Im forced to purchase outside region1 Frasier which has English subtitles.Seinfeld, Friends, Golden Girls, just to mention a few have subtitles......why not Frasier.....disappointing..."
3,Tip for Getting Past the Mandatory Previews,"Although this DVD set doesn't let you access the menu during the previews, you can use the skip/search button to quickly get past them. Just hit it 6 times in a row, and it should bring you to the menu. (A better solution then sitting through 10 minutes of previews every time)."
5,HOW SCATTY IS NILES? LOL,"ONE OF MY FAVOURITE EPISODES!Halloween Episode 3At Niles' literary-themed Halloween ball, Niles and Martin overhear snippets of conversation leading them to believe Frasier and Daphne are sleeping together, and Frasier has impregnated Roz. Niles then challenges Frasier to a duel leading to everyone finding out that Roz is pregnant....EVERY EPISODE IS EXCELLENT ITS A GREAT BOXSET IF YOU ARE A FRASIER FAN OR A FAN OF COMEDY FULL STOP! A MUST FOR YOUR COLLECTION."
5,the excellence continues,Frasier has always been just about the smartest 'comedy of manners' on TV - and it continues to hold true for Season 5. There are lurking dangers that they may be taking this too far ( it did go one season too many ) Roz is pregnant... the Niles and Maris break-up stretched out a little too far... but hey: it still works. It's still funny. It's better than anything currently on network TV.
2,And now the jeers,"The high points of this fine series have already been covered, now instead of the show, let's talk about the product. Very big JEERS AND SNEERS as Paramount once again makes us pay money to watch its advertisements. Be prepared for 5-10 minutes of advertising you can't fast-forward through in order to watch your DVDs. You can even use the ""title menu"" button. All standard control methods to bypass the advertising have been blocked on the disks.The show is a first rate 5-star accomplishment. The product, or rather its company, is turning into a 1-star annoyance with each new disk they put out. Hence the overall low rating I give this set of DVDs as a product, not as a show. I paid for a show, not as tricked funding for advertising."
5,too too funny,"Frasier is so funny..I could watch that cast all day long!that's why i ordered 3 box sets, and will order the next one.and you can't beat the quality."
4,Wonderful Season--annoying situation with ads,"Season five is clever, warm, and funny. I'm so glad it's been released. My husband I excitedly put in the first disk. We were forced to sit through a long ad for Happy Days, and the disk is set up so the viewer cannot fast forward or jump to the main menu. We shrugged and waited.Following the long ad for Happy Days were ads for Laverne and Shirley, Mork and Mindy, McGyver, Charmed, and if you can believe it . . . The Brady Bunch. These are not brief missives, and you cannot fast forward. We were stunned and more than a little annoyed.My advice is to leave the TV off, and put the disk in the DVD player at least ten minutes before you're ready to watch it."
2,"Paramount, shame on you! Great show, chintzy DVDs","What nerve Paramount has. The company has so little regard for the consumer. What could have been a great set is merely average. NO extras of any kind on this set. NO deleted scenes. NO bloopers. NO interviews with the actors or creators. NO commentary. What DO we get? ADS! Crass commercialism has spoiled the legacy of Frasier, a show that so many people worked so hard on. The Seinfeld fans get extras galore. Seinfeld Season 4 has 13 HOURS of exclusive special features! We loyal Frasier stalwarts get nothing. This fan is very disappointed."
5,Frasier has something for everyone!,Frasier is a well written show with characters that the audience can identify with. Their relationships are filled with hilarious situations. I've continued to purchase the Frasier seasons and hope to complete the series shortly.
5,"Very catchy, awesome album",This album deserves more recognition because it's extremely catchy from start to finish. All the songs are unique and have very catchy hooks.
3,love what i hear on pandora,"Clicked on over to grab a copy, and BEHOLD! It is in the MP3 store, with none of the tracks available.There is nothing groundbreaking about this music. Its pretty much your standard house music.I wanted a copy because it seldom gets old. Originality aside, its good stuff."
5,The real Mccoy!,"Without a doubt one of the best masks I've ever seen and its an absolute pleasure to finally own one. Im a true fan of the halloween series (although some would agree that it went a bit silly towards the end and should have ended at H20). Now back to the mask, put simply its awsome!A true replica to the one used in the films and it is very, very freaky. Infact so bad I moved it out of my room and hid it out of the way. Believe me, you do not want to see that looking at you from across the room in the darkness! It is truly terrifying and is a real scare to people. Nobody has not been scared to death yet!The mask fits very well and is quite comfortable and the hair is ultra realistic. With a bolier suite you really do feel like haddonfields own michael myers! Don't delay. If you read this and you ARE unsure but are considering buying a mask - get this one!!"
4,...lose the spectacules,"Just a brief note for rock-music historians. Shortly after the release and critical acclaim of the Thick As A Brick recording, both fans and critics alike were anxiously awaiting Tull's next musical effort. Passion Play just built on the foundation already laid by Thick. Just skip the first 4 minutes of, the ""Hare Who Lost His Spectacules"" track, and you will have a CD worthy of any Tull collection."
5,Amazing!,"I got this album about 2 months ago (I am just now building my music collection) and of all my Jethro Tull cd's (including Thick as a Brick and Aqualung) this is my favourite. At first listening I was (to say the least) disapointed as I hated it and thought I had waisted my money, but I came over here and read some reviews and desided to give it a second chance this time the session went much better and I started to see potential. Today after at least 25 listens I am still stuck!The story of the hair who lost his spectacles isn't a big problem (I usually just fast forward through it) although it could have been made into a seperate track...The sound quality of the CD is very good and though I haven't listened to the previous productions I think it is very well done."
3,"I love Jethro Tull, but...","I honestly can't say that this album impresses me. It sounds like they were trying to recreate Thick as a Brick, but failed in every way.Musically, it's close, but still not as good. Lyrically, it has nothing on TaaB. It's impenetrable, and I would much rather spend 44 minutes listening to Taab then this album.I would consider myself musically mature, and I certainly don't get bored during long songs (especially considering that the lengths of my 3 favorite songs are 43:50, 26:00, and 23:32, respectively). This album just doesn't hold my interest for all 40+ minutes, and as such, I would not recommend it except to hardcore Tull fans."
1,terrible tull!,"This is the most disjointed record I have ever heard. No cohesivness whatsoever. Just when you think It can't get any worse, they throw in a nursery ryme to make things really entertaining. A big Tull throwaway!"
3,Good Book,"A good general book of famous photography. The pictures are, of course, famous, but not of the highest quality. A nice book to sit and browse through."
4,Excellent coffee table book,The perfect gift for the nerdy coffee-lover in your family! The pages are high-quality and the descriptions are informative and not superficial.
4,Como nuevo,"Pedi este libro de medio uso y me quede sorprendida cuando lo recibi, parece casi nuevo. Suplidor muy confiable."
1,Bull,"None of these covers ""changed the world"". Whether they will admit it or not, the American media don't rule the world. Least of all Life Magazine. If they're so important, why did they go out of business?"
2,inflate to 250+mmHg - amputate the arm why don't you?,"The 1st couple of times I used it, I thought it was great...but then lately, I've been needing to inflate it to over 250mmHg before the device starts measuring.and it deflates really slowly, so the pressure is kept really high, which really pisses off my patients.when it worked well... it was great: light, small, handy."
1,Returned it.,"Appeared well made and the instructions were clear and easy to understand but my wife and I did not like it. I purchased this on my Doctor's recommendation to get a cuff type because he felt the wrist band monitor's were not as accurate. Well, we could not get an accurate reading from the LifeSource and it actually HURT when pumped to the point were it signaled it was ready to start. To be fair my wife and I have a lot of body fat (large arms, but we ordered the large size cuff) and this may affect the accuracy of the reading and the pressure required. I like the manual inflate concept and wish it would have worked for us. But it did not and we returned it and continue to use the ForeCare Model 1300 wrist band monitor my in-laws gave us."
4,Large?,"The product is well made and I suggest this product to others. However, be sure to select the correct cuff size. This does matter for accuracy of the blood pressure reading. Though my friend is a large women, the large cuff is too large and gave false low readings. I had to reorder the medium cuff"
4,Works fine!,"I bought this because the cuff on the blood pressure monitor that my wife had was not quite the right size. Her's is a little nicer product with the batteries and auto inflation of the cuff. With her unit, it was actually a little nicer to use. This one does the job, but I just find it a little awkward holding the display with one hand with the air line twisting around and then pumping up the cuff with the other hand. Otherwise, it is now the proper size cuff for me and has been working fine."
1,Can't get this thing to work.,I can't make this thing work but maybe 1 out of 5 tries. I can't for the life of me figure out how not to get cuff errors. Very frustrating. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Not compatible with small cuff!,"I understood that this comes with a medium cuff and knew that would be too big for me, so I ordered the Lifesource small cuff at the same time. I liked the fact I wouldn't need to buy batteries constantly, so didn't mind the extra cost of buying a separate cuff. But when the item arrived, the box stated NOT compatible with Lifesource small cuff! This information was nowhere on the online information. What kind of manufacturer makes products that are not compatible with its other products-- it makes no sense."
4,No Medical Expert... BUT,"I'm no medical expert...BUT I experimented a little bit, and would use it a few times in a row just to see if it was consistent, and each time would get a different reading... So does it work accurately? I'm not sure.However, this shouldn't take place of getting a real reading from a medical professional anyways, and the readings were ""close"" enough to satisfy me. Also, the price was so reasonable that I kept it (I got it for $12.xx).The main user of this is my 64 year old diabetic father so that he could keep an eye on things between his doctor visits, and this device is easy to use that he has no problems at all operating it."
3,Covers what other books don't cover,"This book is a nice book if you know Visual Basic already. but not if you are a beginner since it does not cover the basic concepts of VB. It has nice details about using printer object, using VBScript in VB, dynamically generating controls, MS Agent and things of that nature. I wished to see something about DHTML in it but it was only mentioned but not covered. Its a good book, I wouldn't rule it out as a good book, but I wouldn't go as far as saying its for the experts. it helps understand new features in VB6 and provides good explanation of different topics. in short, its a good book..."
1,Source Code is vague and incomplete,"This is really one of the most horrible books, that I have ever read. Throw this book out event if you get it as a gift from your' boss ( If possible throw your Boss out too). The topics in this book dose't cover anything, you would probally be better off staring at the computer doing nothing. The sample code given in the book dosent work, this book is probally for a real 'Expert' who probally can figure out why the given sample programs dont' work. Moreover the authors style of coding is really horrible, there aren't any coding conventions followed. Not even a single topic is covered in detail. Please do your self an favour and buy any other book, except this on. If you sill have to buy this book, make sure that you read this book in a room that has many windows."
5,A nice VB reference book that filled with many ideas,"Let's see ... this book was written 6 years ago and you are wondering why I'm bother to write. Well, I didn't planed to write until I went over to Peter Wright's Beginning VB6 object which was also came about the same time as this text and I saw people still writing reviews on it. So ...I've always enjoy reading VB6 expert guide, even when the codes didn't worked. The fix utility tool didn't really worked either (i.e., the treeview controls etc.) Then one day I found the correct codes in the site justplanes(?) and now I'm a happy man.The author didn't spoon fed you with every nuances of explanation behind the codes, rather, he presented the topics with the codes and you go explore further. This is exactly how I wanted it. There are lots and lots of ideas here and examples that works (finally). Once you master all these topics, you will be well on your way to become an expert."
1,Don't be fooled...,"This book has a lot of content, and would be better suited to entry level Visual Basic developers.If you have at least one year experience with VB, don't waste your money. (I'm returning my copy to the store.)"
4,Good Book for VB Developers,This book gives the development tips for VB programmers. But there is no detail summary about COM/DCOM and ASP. For Win32 API this book is one of the best in the market.
3,Suprised by different version,"The DVD came in excellent condition but was a different version than I was expecting. Who knew that there were two different ""Return to the Secret Garden"" versions made? Not I! I still enjoyed it."
4,love this product,This is a great product that has been around for many years and has not disappointed me yet. I use this product on my stretch marks and for moisturizing my skin---it works great!
5,great so far for pregnancy!,"This was recommended to me as a great body moisturizer to use during pregnancy. I've been using it for a few months now and absolutely love it -- my skin feels great, it's helped a lot with preventing itchiness, and so far not a stretch mark in sight! Only negative is that it feels a bit greasy and can take a little while to fully soak in, so I only use it at night before bed."
1,Meh.,"The writing in this book was abysmal and the actual story was ... meh.If you want to read a book about the Naval Academy, you're much better off with The Return of Philo T. McGiffin by David Poyer, A Sense of Honor by James Webb, or Darkside by P. T. Deutermann."
5,Just Beautiful,"The Night Before...A Celtic Christmas by Dordan is forty-nine minutes and thirty-two seconds long and released on September 9, 1997. All of the music is in Celtic\Irish setting. Even the words are sung in Gaelic. The only traditional Christmas song on it is Silent Night; and that is done in a Cetic twist. If you love Irish music and Christmas, then this cassette is for you.

4,Very Good Product,If you can get pass the manual pumping you'll find that this product is very solid and very accurate. I checked it against my wrist monitor that was checked and found accurate at the doctor's office. Wanted a monitor that gave me the closest feeling to checking my blood pressure at the Doctor's office being that I have White Coat Hypertension. Definitely not disappointed. This really works.
5,Lifesource UA705 Blood pressure monitor,"It works great,no problems,its accurate and I like the 30 reading average.I would recommend this unit for puchase for someone looking for a manual monitor."
1,not consistent,"When I got this bp monitor, it worked the first time I used it. When I tried it a week later, it would not get a reading, just count down as it deflated every time. I thought it was me, so i tried it on my brother, it did not work on him. I finally got it to work on my mom, after the fourth try. I was very disappointed in this product, I did not trust the readings even when it worked."
3,Watch the size,"When I ordered this, I didn't notice that there were different sized cuffs. I saw medium cuff and that seemed right. My husband is 6'1 and 185 pounds- not a really large man. But the cuff would not fit around his arm and we had to return it."
4,Decent,"Works as advertised and appears to be only fairly accurate. Blood pressure is best measured in a hospital setting, frankly; this little thing gives a basic picture of one's BP within the guidelines as to whether or not there's a spike or etc. It's probably better than ballpark. In other words, I'm going to get another cuff and compare. I want the closest to accuracy as possible."
2,Readings too high,"The readings on this were much higher than at my doctor's. Like 20 points higher, for both systolic and diastolic."
3,It's okay,"Hanger came quickly and was in advertised condition.It's a perfectly standard banana hanger. However, the hook could be bigger.I'm going to have to get a bigger hook. The good thing about how this one is made is that the hook is easily replaceable."
3,Banana Hanger,Works pretty good; however doesn't keep the bananas from aging but keeps them off the counter and does look good.
1,Left Me Hanging,I ordered two of these. One of them was received broken in half. It was too much of a headache to return so I just threw it away. Guess I will stick to just books when buying from Amazon. Hard to break those.
5,Customer Service,I have got a very good and prompt service and response from Amazon for the book ordered.
3,"The Girl, the Hunchback, and the Monkey.","Five years ago, in Paris, the illicit gambling house in the Place Noire was raided by the police. Several of the gang were killed, one was caught and jailed, and one escaped by shambling off in the guise of a workman, accompanied by a young girl, a dwarf, and a monkey.Gilbert Hannaway, who was wounded as a bystander on the night of the raid, has been searching for the girl for five years. One evening, out of the window of his hotel, he finds her.Lord Ellingham is a peer of the realm, with a successful marriage, and a cabinet position, but he flees England rather than meet with the girl.Jacques Leblun, most brilliant of French detectives, desires to end his illustrious career by landing the long sought ""escaped"" man from the raid.And what of Ambrose the dwarf and Chicot the monkey? What secrets do they hold?E Phillips Oppenheim, writing as Anthony Partridge."
4,Errol Flynn Adventures,All the movies were great. Only problem I had was that one of the DVD's were scratched and didn't play very well.
4,Bring backs those memories.,These songs were instrumental in my late teen years. Each one just seems to remind me of one event or another as I was growing up. Highly recommended.
3,Light Reading on a Vacation,"Similar yet different from the Left Behind Series. Anotherauthor's touch. Didn't snatch me right up like those first few ofLeft Behind did. Final book is interesting in terms of looking over the story from an omni-perspective. If you are new to Christian novels and want to get a feel for the authors then you won't be unsatisfied. If not, there's plenty more out there. But, to each his/her own. END"
3,"Charges great, but doesn't sync my 1st generation iPod touch","I ordered this to replace one that was lost in a fire. I still had the adapter from my last one that can be used to charge my iPod in a wall outlet, so I ordered this replacement cable to fit the adapter (firewire). The seller was great and my cable arrived very quickly. Unfortunately, this cable doesn't work to sync my iPod. It charges great when plugged into my computer or used with my firewire adapter in the wall outlet, but I have no means of syncing my iPod. Since charging works, I can only assume that the wire isn't completely compatible with my generation of iPod touch. Sad.When charging, I love that this is retractable. It keeps the wires from getting kinked when I stuff it in a drawer and they're not all over the place when I'm charging it in the wall outlet. It keeps the wire nice and neat for travel. Overall, it is a good product, just not fully compatible with my iPod."
1,Useless,This item is a nothing but a power cord. It does not provide the functionality of the original Apple firewire cord. Your iPod will not mount on the desktop so music cannot be transferred. I have tried it with both Gen 2 & 3 iPods. You'll be disappointed.
4,More than described,"Eliminates cord clutter on your desk by retracting cord when not in use. This product actually has both a USB and a Firewire plug attached to the ipod connector, so it works for either connection type. Doesn't work properly with older ipods (like 3G or older), even though it fits in some of the same sockets. But for its intended and advertised use, it's perfect."
1,Only works with old iPods,"this product does not work with the new 5G model. if you have a new ipod, do not purchase this, it will only allow the ipod to charge, not worth the money."
2,Lacks depth and below-the-surface understanding,"Judith Miller's book is full of references to her ""friends"" in the Middle East. They all seem to live very privileged lives that are not representative of the existence of most Middle Easterners. I cannot remember an instance in which she spoke to an everyday citizen of one of the countries she wrote about. Of course, this would be difficult for her as she seems to have never learned Arabic despite her many, many years in the region. For these reasons, her book might be an easy introduction to the Middle East, but for anyone else I would recommend finding a better source of information."
4,Good General Overview,"Given that this book is a piece of reporting, not an academic study, it does an excellent job of giving the reader an overview of the rise of militant Islam and its destructive effect on this part of the world."
1,Biased and Inaccurate,"The author seems to draw conclusions that the ineptitude of the Arab leaders of today are somehow caused by the tenets of Islam and the teachings of its prophet, which patently is absurd. Most western readers are not aware of the fact that while all of Christian Europe was in the dark ages, the intellectual culture of the early greeks and Romans was being preserved and expanded upon by the Muslims. The Muslims have made tremendous contributions in the areas philosophy, art, poetry, astronomy, medicine, etc. If the religion was flawed, as Miller suggests, this period of flourishing would not be possible. The situation as it exists in the Middle East today is one that is perpetuated by the west (i.e. U.S.) in order to maintain their oil interests. Miller clearly lacks 1) an objective perspective, and 2) any inkling of knowledge regarding the history of Islam and Islamic culture."
3,Discussing an intersting subject with a biased agenda,"While the book has addressed the idea that islamic groups in different ME countries have different agendas and follow them using different means, the main theme of the book was to highlight the worst manifestiations of the islamic revival in the ME. Judith Miller only emphasised the fundementalist agenda and discarded all other islamic agendas and groups. Even in her countries selection she has discarded countries that have strong islamic beliefs and open societies like UAE and Malaysia, and other islamic countries were muslims are mistreated because of their beliefs, like tunisia and turkey.It would be interesting to see her write a book about the jewish fundimantalism as she promised at the end of her book. I think she will find many similarties between fundamentalism in Islam, Judism or any other relgion in the world."
4,A Spellbinding Look at a Troubled Part of Our World,"Look no farther than the Amazon reviews to see that this book has touched a nerve in the militant Islamic community. If you find yourself wondering about the Middle East and its many problems, this book will begin to unravel some of the issues that engulf this fascinating region."
4,"Enlightening, depressing view of forces at cross-purposes.","Taking into consideration that she is a woman first and a journalist second I found Ms. Miller's book to be an excellent eye opener. My first line is not meant to be insulting but I have to believe that a male journalist would have much better access to information, people and places than a woman. Nonetheless, I bought the book to read up on the homeland of a new acquaintance from Lebanon. Twenty-seven and idealistic he has been over here attending university for five years. He hopes to return to Lebanon, especially to raise children after he is married. After reading this book I have sadly concluded he has little to return to. Thank you Ms. Miller"
5,A fascinating portrayal of life in the Middle East,"I found this text to be a truly fascinating read; a thorough country by country analysis of the social, politicaland religious climate of the Middle Eastern countries. There is much to learn here, not so much as a study of thegood or evil (take your pick) of Islam but as a tremendously thorough study of the cultures of these countries andhow those cultures and practices developed. This is as good a ""history' text as I have ever read. Most of theinformation is conveyed through conversations with the locals.The message here is not what is good or bad aboutIslam. It is a well researched text full of information that you can use to form your own opinion. I highly recommend""God Has 99 Names"" to anyone with an interst in this area of the world."
1,"Uninformed, racist, garbage","For Judith Miller, an ""expert"" on the middle-east for 25 years not to even bother to learn Arabic or Persian is a travesty. She relies on interviews with corrupt politicians and displays little understanding of Islam. She does not quote one Islamic source for her backround on the religion, and writes like high-school researcher writing a book report from his or her household Encyclopaedia. She is fond of name dropping, and as a New York Times correspondant, has had access to those in power. But like some Americans who visit Paris and eat at the first McDonald's they see, she displays little understanding or compassion for the culture or people she is their to investigate."
1,Unserious,"The ""otherness"" of islamic culture has not only permanently benumbed some journalistic circles in the US, but it has also replaced the bad guy that reductionist American movie mentality has been so fond of creating. This book wants to exploit this niche of the market (thank God, merely a niche, though a quite big one). Horrid typifications, bad use of Arab, tendentious and prejudicial statements, research not carried to a full and serious extent: This and more forms part of the elementary threads of the book. Anyone who wants an academically or journalistically balanced understanding of Islam don't waste your time..."
2,A for Effort; D for Insight,"Judith Miller never really reached the heart of the Islamic world, in my opinion. She did her research; traveled everywhere and had, via New York Times, mega-access. What she did not have was the right kind of heart to delve into the depths. Also lacking was writing that draws the reader into the adventure. This results, no doubt, from being a mainstream journalist, not a freelancer who has time to spend with ordinary folks in every country."
1,Worthless,"Do not, I repeat, DO NOT read this book, as it is totally biased and the author is not an expert on the Middle East as she proclaims. She is not even fluent in any of the common Middle Eastern languages, thus has to rely on either translations or translators, which too are subject to biasness. There is nothing scholarly about this book!"
3,why all goodies in VHS format that can't last long? DVD pls.,"I've found out most of the goodies' it's not in DVD format forthe rock& roller collector likes....even does is 5 star, I'm not going to purchase this productin VHS format ""because tha damn Tape just can't last long forserious collector""!!!!! :( not to mention VHS like Smokie Livein Norway, Judas Priest Live sreaming of vengeance, Iron maidenLive after Dead..... etc.."
3,OK,I am an avid acoustic guitar player and I am always looking for new/different products to make playing more enjoyable. I gave these a shot and thought they were ok. I think they would be more suitable for electric guitars. They seem to wear faster than most as well. I'll have them as back-up but probably wouldn't purchase them again.
5,Best picks on phosphor bronze long-life strings,I love the pick attack with these. I have used almost everything out there over 20 years of playing and have settled on this pick as my go-to choice for acoustic guitar.
5,Great picks that work great on both acoustic and electric guitars,"I've been buying Dunlop pick for at least 15 years now, and I love the feel and the grip. The picks last for a really long time, and I would recommend getting several thickness' for different applications. But for sitting in a room playing around, with my acoustics and electric guitars this is a decent all round pick"
4,No more missed pills,"I have found that I have not missed any of my medications anymore since I got this. I like how easy it is to set and change times for medications. I sleep later on weekends and it is very easy to change the alarm for a later morning pill on Saturday.I do not like the small display. I thought a missed pill would be more obvious. But it has a small text indicator.The alarm is loud enough to hear across my house, so I would think anyone who can hear a doorbell will hear this."
1,Barley audible,I purchased this for 89 and 92 yr old couple the alarm was barley audible and I called e-pill to see if I had a defective one. They told me they had no complaints and put me on hold; when she came back she said I bought it on Amazon and to contact them to return it. She offered no help and would not accept that I might have a defective one. I had no problem with the seller just the manufacture VERY POOR customer service. I have returned this item
5,en-TRANCED,"I was lucky enough to see Hassan Hakmoun and his little brother perform for a live broadcast as part of Chicago's second annual World Music Festival last week. Although his performance differed from this recording in that the music was pared down to sintir and hand-held percussion, the effect was similar: repetitive (but never tedious) rhythmic ground as a basis for soaring, yearning vocals. Oddly, one western group that came fleetingly to mind was the Grateful Dead in their more contemplative improvisational pieces such as Dark Star--a similar trance-inducing music. I have always loved feeling so transported!"
3,"Solid Explanations, Interesting Speculations","This is an interesting book written for a wide audience. Rose, a distinguished biologist known for his theoretical and experimental work on aging, aims to give a concise overview of Darwinism, a historical background of Darwinism, some insight into the importance of Darwinism for our culture, and some ideas about how Darwinism might help to explain human behavior. He accomplishes all these goals in this relatively brief and well written volume. Though I don't agree with all of Rose's conclusions, this is a good introductory book with a good annotated bibliography."
2,My Impressions of Darwin's Spectre:....,"I found the first 3rd of the book very helpfull. I estimate that I was able to understand about 80% of what was written.I found the second 2/3rds of the book (with the exception of the last two chapters) nearly useless, because I estimate that I was only able to understand approximately 20% of what was written.The last 2 chapters, I understood, but did not learn much from them.P.S. I am educated, and have well above average intelligence."
3,Lacks visual appeal of textbook version,"The $70 dollar textbook version of this work admirably fills its role as an introductory college text. However, the edition available here and at general bookstores is photo-offset in black and white, and consequently the many color maps and photographs in the original lose their visual splendor. For the general reader I would recommend instead Thomas Martin's ""Ancient Greece: From Prehistoric to Hellenistic Times,"" which is just as good as Pomeroy et al. and less than half the price."
3,Bought because I had to,"This book was on a recommended list for my son's preparation for a competition. He loves history, but has preferred other books we found in the library to this one. It might be better suited to high schoolers or older readers."
2,Ugh,"Well...at least it's thorough. A little too thorough, if you ask me. Pomeroy tends to drone on and on (and on!) and you get to where you wish she would just get to the point already. Each chapter is *50-60 pages long.* There are a lot of insets with clips from speeches and the like, so that's not bad but it can be distracting if you have to really concentrate to read like I did. Good index, which was very helpful.In a nutshell, I suppose it's not the worst textbook I ever had but it's definitely not the best. Hopefully you will enjoy this more than I did, and perhaps I would have actually enjoyed it had it not been required reading."
1,What a sham!,"I purchased this book because I am rebuilding our ceremonial team.The tips, advice, etc. promised are nowhere to be found in this book.The author has padded the length of his book with an excessive number of blank endsheets, leading the reader to believe that this book is more in depth or complete than the small booklet available from Supreme.Save your money and stick with Supreme!"
1,Knights of Columbus a Guide for Officers First Degree,"I expected this book to be an informative overview of the first degree ceremony for officers that participates in the first degree ceremony. First of all, the ceremony is supposed to be secret so that any new Knight that participates is not informed prior to the ceremony. Knowing the outcome takes a lot of the charm and suspense out of the ceremony, if the candidate already knows what lessons are to be taught.What I read were excerpts from the official handbook that are not supposed to be handed out in the public domain. The worst part was that there were huge parts missing. The book is a shame because it was plagiarized from the Knights of Columbus and is not beneficial at all. IT really should be taken off the market.I feel that I was deceived and need to be refunded my money.Dennis- in Houston"
1,Not complete,I found several printed pages but mostly blank pages. I have been warning my friends to not buy it and to use caution when buying from this source.
4,What A Cool Book!,"I loved this book. I have all the Thoroughbred Books, and this is one of the best. I only wish Jazz Goddess was Christina's horse later on, instead of Sterling Dream. Otherwise, great book!"
4,In the middle,"I don't really like these prologue/epilogue books.Usually in the middle it's dreams or memories.Most of it's boring except when Christina got hurt.I agree with her,""I hope they ban hats at these meets from now on"".I HATE Ross!"
4,What a Great Book!,"I really love this book. I have all the Thoroughbred Books up to #43, including all the ASHLEIGH books, and the special editions. This was one of the best. I only wish that Christina's horse was named Jazz Goddess later on, instead of Sterling Dream. Also, I wish her boyfriend was Kevin instead of Parker. Other wise it was a GREAT book!!"
3,A Nice But Unrealistic Book,"I think the author should stick to writing about racing. In this book, a horse kicks eight-month-pregnant Ashleigh in the side. She has to go to the hospital. Her baby is born, but a blood vessel in Ashleigh's brain bursts. She goes unconscious, and she starts to dream about Christina, her baby, in her older years. In the dream, Ashleigh has died, and Christina is eventing. I won't go into further details.In this book, Joanna Campbell has Christina jumping a three-year-old filly and considering riding her in three-day events. Ridiculous! That would do damage to the young horse's legs, and the horse would be too young to compete, anyway. Also, in the book, the filly, Jazz Goddess, is born as a runt. But later in the book, she is portrayed as tall and big over and over and over. There's also a lot of other unrealistic stuff, but I'll let you read the book on your own."
3,Kind of a givaway,"This book was kind of a givaway.Lots of those things actualy happned in future books . And they could have said more about what happned while Ashliegh was in the hospital.But I still think this was quiet a good book,even if it was a little hard to understand."
3,You get what you pay for,For what I paid it's not a bad tool. The strap tore off the sheath the first day I wore it. One of the inserts in the handle fell out shortly thereafter. The pliers seem good and strong and the rest of the tools are serviceable but not up to par with the more expensive muilti-tools.
4,Great tool for the price,Bought this for a Christmas gift exchange. My father ended up grabbing it. He wares is all the time now. I have been carrying around a Gerber 400 compact for quite some time now. I thing the overall build quality is better on the Gerber which is made in the USA. This Winchester knife is also manufactured by Gerber but made in china. And excellent tool for those who don't want to shell out $50-70 for a Gerber.
3,Good Overall Buy For the Money,Tool works well but the holster strap broke after 3 months of wearing it everyday. Gonna buy a leatherman wave for my belt and use this in the tackle box. Worth what i paid
3,"Good multitool, but, get a Gerber","I bought this thinking in the Winchester name...Ok... old school guy... i know...But, this is a simple chinese rebrand multiT, for 25$, better get a Gerber...It's works, but, it's the chinese mass production issues... no good finishing, poor details, the tools are hard to open and a little danger to use, cause you must to open all to select one...It's really usable, but... like i said... too much for too less.Hey winchester... cmon!You have a name to honor, take care with this!"
3,It works...a little,"This product works, but mutes the volume too much for my liking. I cannot be too mad because the price is the best, however, I expected more.You do get what you pay for."
1,no support at all,This cushion sinks as soon as you sit on it. I had hoped for more support. It wasn't at all what I expected.
3,Just a plastic cushion,"Well it served the purpose of raising a partially handicapped person higher up in their chair. The name of it really is a stretch. It is just a block of foam cushion which makes it a little easier to get up out of a chair, but it is just a plastic cushion and requires a sheet or something to cover it, maybe a square pillow cushion? It is not a comfortable seat for long term seating."
3,NOT BAD,"The creeper is not bad, and the jack stands are ok, but watch out with the jack. It is ok, but this unit is very narrow, and you must be 100% sure your car is on level ground if you jack it up from the side, as this jack has a tendency to roll over being so narrow, it does not have a large foot print on the ground. Other then that, it is fine."
4,Ennis is Gold,You can pretty much pick up anything that had Garth Ennis's name on it and it will be an enjoyable read.
3,First time ordering this weight loss product,I have heard alot of good things about this product from people I know personally.Everyone I know that has taken it has had great success.
3,Good weight loss supplement,I have seen dramatic changes in my performance at the gym. I look and feel better too because of this product.
4,Working well so far,I have lost 22 lbs in my 4th week using this product. I am also dieting strictly and exercising with a professional trainer (who actually introduced me to this product.) Overall I feel great and will continue to use Zyroxin till I have achieved my desired weight loss goal.
1,THE REVIEWS ARE INDEED FAKE! I checked them!,"I am glad for conscientious people like the last 2 who blew the whistle on these fake reviews. I was looking at buying this supplement and would have never known the positive reviews are fake but I looked at their ""see my other reviews tab and they all only have the one review. The writing is also similar, one sentence, short, etc. which is another clue. I will know now to check this on other products I look at on Amazon. Thanks to the 2 real reviewers! (P.S. Feel free to check my other reviews! I actually have some!)"
3,It seems to be working well for us,I ordered this for my husband and myself to give us a well needed boost to lose weight. It is working very well for my husband me on the other hand I don't like to exercise I don't like the gym I feel too self concience when I'm there. I will continue to take it till I feel confident enough to go to the gym with my husband
3,Helping with baby weight,I just ordered my second bottle of Zyroxin and I feel that it has given me the ability to take off 7 solid pounds of weight I gained during my pregnancy.I hope this review helps others who are shopping for a successful weight loss product.
4,I love thos product,The results I achieved in my weight loss are phenomenol. People don't even recognize me because of the 57 lobs I shed taking this product.I will continue to both use and recommend this to anyone with weight issues.
5,Amazing Weight Loss Product,This is the first time a weight loss product actually worked for me without making me jittery or jumpy when I take it. Also no wierd side effects like insomnia.
4,I saw immediate results,Zyroxin is my favorite weight loss product I have found that works great. I don't feel amped up to the degree that I get the jitters. It gives me just enough energy to have an awesome workout without overdoing it. I will continue to use it. I'm not trying to lose much weight only 5 lbs but I'm trying to sculpt my body to look hot for summer!
4,Zyroxin review,"Great product, great results. By far the most effective weight loss supplement I have tried."
5,Zyroxin is The Best,I think I created a weight loss frenzy amongst my co-workers. Considering I gave birth to an 8 lb baby boy 3 months ago I look leaner and more fit than before I was pregnant! Zyroxin gave me the energy to work out and lose the 17 lbs I gained during my pregnancy. Everyone is amazed at how I look. Every new Mom that wants her fabulous figure back should try Zyroxin!!
1,ALL OF THESE POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE FAKE!,"There is only 1 review under 3 stars. The rest are fakes, their ids all look like real names but have no other reviews or activity. Don't fall for it."
3,So far I really feel this product is working......,I am thrilled with Zyroxin. I have lost 12 lbs since I started taking it 4 weeks ago. I get great energy without the shaky feeling I used to get when I used to take a weight loss supplement (which I wont disclose the name.)I really believe in this product and is worth trying.
1,Depressive Zyroxin results,"After two months of Zyroxin - first with the suggesed 3 capsules twice a day and then with 4 twice a day, I have not even lost a gram! Obviously, I continued with my diet and increased my daily exercises. Depressing - not only because of no reduced weight, but Zyroxin certainly doesn't come cheaply."
5,product is Working Great!!!,"Since I started to take zyroxin 5 weeks ago, I lost 16 pounds. I am feeling great. At first i had doubts about Zyroxin because of the other products that I have taken in the past. But, now i am releaved that I have found something that has worked for me."
5,Season 2 even better,"Season 2 is better than season one...now lets have 3 through 5, which are already out in the English PAL version!"
1,worst of the series! don't get it!,"I strongly disliked season 2 of waiting for god. I loved every episode of season 1; howeever, I found all except the very last episode of season 2 offensive, in bad taste, and painful. I felt worse after watching it. Don't get it - get season 1."
4,Love Diane and Tom but Track 7 is damaged,"I fell in love with this series and shared it with many people. Started buying the CD's. In Series Two, the Track 7 is damaged which is the only reason I'm rating it a 4, the series deserves a 5 unreservedly. I've had it reshipped 3 times but we're still unable to view that show. Bummer"
5,Almost like home,"This British comedy is no longer shown on PBS where I live and I've really missed watching it! Inasmuch as I live in an Assisted Living home, it is even more entertaining now. There are so many similarities to reality in both plot and personalities. What fun!!"
5,Delightful,No one does humor better than the Brits.This series is delightful and filled with laughs.
4,Waiting for God,"It's a great British comedy. I live in a retirement resort in Medford, OR and we see how close it is to what a retirement community can actually be like."
2,Just OK,"These are just OK. Nothing crazy good that I'd buy again. They taste like almond oatmeal and after it soaks in the milk a while, it tastes just like oatmeal b/c it turns it yellow-ish and thicker. FYI the boxes are tiny, like miniature cereal toy boxes."
3,"Uneven, and only Mildly Interesting","This book had been so built up by other people who had read it that I expected more. The writing is uneven and the first two thirds of the book seem to have almost no relation to the last third.The first two thirds of the book gave a few interesting details of life in Russia just before the Revolution, but other than that I foundit very uninteresting. It is not until alomst the end of the book that the element of cocaine is even introduced and when it is the book quickly winds to its unsurprising end."
5,Provides a solid foundation for anyone new to routing.,"Robert Wright is an excellent technical writer, and I found the book not just informative but a joy to read. If your studing for the CCNA, I recommend this book, ""Introduction to Cisco Router Configuration"", and ""Internetworking Technologies handbook"" all by Cisco systems press. Two thumbs up!"
2,Some good info but not well organized,"There is some good info in this book but the principle criticism with is a major lack of organization of the material. It is almost as though the topics were written on little pieces of paper, thrown into a hat, and then drawn one at a time and associated to chapter 2, chapter 3, etc. For example, a discussion of binary numbers and network addressing, a preliminary topic, is left until chapter 8.""VLSMs"" and ""IP unnumbered"" are combined into one chapter. Although both topics can be thought to solve a similar problem, not much of a case is made for that. There are actually no chapters specific to routing protocols, the heart of routing. Instead, an assumption seems to be made that the reader is already familiar with routing protocols, in spite of the first chapter assuming the reader knows nothing about routing."
4,A Military Must,"This reference guide is a must for anyone in or intrested in the Military. It is a valuble piece to start your military book collection and can help identify even things commisioned and nco's would have no clue about. ""put in on your wish list"""
1,Better Than Nothing,"Not really much of a dictionary, in my view -- e.g., the entry for ""TIS"" simply tells you what the acronym stands for. That's it. I was hoping for an actual entry, with notes that place the term in context. Maybe not encyclopedic, though that would have been great -- but at least the rudimentary entry of a ""dictionary,"" for Christ's sake! I'm just short of sorry at having purchased this -- what does it matter to know that ""TIS"" stands for ""Time In Service"" if I don't know what that *means*??"
2,Review based on first 100 pages - couldn't bring myself to finish it,I found it really difficult to keep reading this book since this is the second in a series and I didn't read the first one as it wasn't available as an eBook. But aside from that I had a really difficult time building any sort of rhythm while reading as the story was peppered with names of characters and locations that felt like pot-holes in my mind. And after about a hundred pages into it I simply decided to give it up as I had several books in my queue I wanted to move on to.
5,Great plot from humerous writer,"This is a good beginning to this series. Just enough introducation to place the setting and then very entertaining and funny with a nice plot, with several surprise events that helped the denouement along. Nicely written although a bit whimsical."
5,Memoir of Young woman's battle with diabetes.,"Andie Dominick was my writing instructor 2 semesters ago - she was inspiring as an instructor and, after having read this book I find her complex, but even more inspiring as she shares her life in this memoir. This is also a story of sisterhood, and the bond that she and Denise shared, partially because of blood, partially because of diabetes, that anyone with a sister can identify with. ( she would't like me ending a sentence with a preposition.) I cried until I had to put the book down, but was compelled to pick it up again before my tears were dry. I highly recommend this and am proud to know Andie!"
2,Unappealing Narrator,"I really wanted to like this book, and I wanted to like the narrator, because she has been through hell with her diabetes. But I found her attitudes toward the medical profession and her family hard to empathize with. She comes across as selfish and self-absorbed. A good medical narrative should offer some perspective on the ""big picture,"" I feel, not just the world of the patient. She's a competent writer, but she's hampered by her ""This happened and then that happened,"" prose style, and never looks into what others might be thinking and feeling. The prose began to feel so robotic, and so humorless, I found myself skipping paragraphs."
5,"Moving, and at the same time, tremendously true to life.","""Needles"" is an amazing book. Being a diabetic for nearly 26 of my 29 years, I was certain that the last thing I would want to read about was diabetes. Ms Dominick blew me away! I was emotionally touched by the personal, familial aspects of the book. The whole sister-sister relationship/bond was quite profoundly moving for me. In addition to the emotional reaction, I found myself wondering at times if the author knew something of my childhood/adulthood with diabetes. I often saw myself in the pages of this book. I suspect that many diabetics would say the same.I was thoroughly impressed by Ms Dominick's account of a lifetime with diabetes. It was not soft-pedaled and was presented realistically. People on ""the outside"" can nonchalantly say that this disease is controllable and therefore not a big deal. I applaud Ms Dominick for telling the truth about it and telling it so eloquently."
5,one of my all time favorites made me cry,"i am a diabetic and this book was wonderful, it brought me to tears growing up with diabetes is real tough and this book shows some of the hardships it is funny sweet real sad ecspicially for diabetics, this book made me cry it explains a lot about diabetes"
1,Pure Propaganda,"I am one of the people shown in this video.Before you buy it, I strongly suggest that you find my Bible codes web page and read the long critique of this video that appears there.You will find that the video got many basic facts wrong, and did not have any of the ""balance"" that it so proudly proclaims.If you still want to buy it after that, go ahead."
1,A complete drivel and deception of viewers,The video in question is purportedly a balanced account on the Bible code controversy. It is anything but. It provides forum for a number of code proponents while denying it to the code opponents. It competely distorts the real story about the alleged discovery of the code and about the ongoing dispute.
1,Terrible service because of the price,I have not received the product yet!I think the reason for this is that the books were very inexpensive. If it is going to take months to get a product it should not be posted for sale at a low price.
5,A sonic and spiritual sensation,"This is an exquisitely beautiful recording. Dominated by the sounds of piccolos and drums, the procession sounds hypnotic. Highly recommended."
3,Educational,"These videos give a good amount of information on Anacondas and Piranhas. The Anaconda had quite a few parts that you could barely hear the narration due to bad sound editing. But the information was overall pretty good. But if you're looking for an action, monster snake kind'a video go watch some fairytale Hollywood movie."
5,Science Fiction And Fantasy By Leading Writers,"For those of you that prefer pure 'Hard' science fiction please be advised that some of the sixteen stories here contain elements of fantasy, and I for one also prefer 'Hard' science fiction. Nevertheless, every one of these stories are page turners and will keep your interest. These writers are veterans, and at the beginning of each story editor Lou Anders, also an accomplished writer, introduces each one of them, they all have impressive credentials. All of the stories demonstrate great creativity, and the words just flow off the pages. After reading this, perhaps you, like me, will realize that a lot of unanticipated bad things may materialize out of future capabilities. Read and enjoy."
1,Zipp Vuka Pad Riser Kit,Well made of quality material. Too bad the design does not allow for more of a universal fit. Two reinforcement bars are positioned about 1 or 2 mm too far apart and will not allow the bolts from the pads to pass through and maintain proper alignment. This forced me to explore other options and the local hardware store came up with some plumbing fixture that work great!
3,Too Hard for a 5 year old to use,I purchased this toy for my nephew who is 5. He loves Spiderman so of course he liked the toy. The trigger that fires the webs and darts is impossible for him to use. The box lists the age range for this toy as starting at 5-years-old. My nephew became frustrated when he could not use the trigger. I'd say the age range for this one should start around 7.
3,no dad in the family,"this is a pretty good book dealing with the subject of a child not having a dad in his life. The only thing I really didn't like is that the story starts out with the child being teased about not having a dad, and I wouldn't like to put that idea into a child's mind if it had not happened yet. But overall, a helpful book to open the discussion."
2,Bland,"I understand the point of this book, to show that some children have deadbeat dads. But my problem is this, the books flows until the end. Suddenly 'Grampa' comes into the picture. Almost like a new part of the story, but then the book abruptly ends. It's doesn't flow and suddenly the question of grampa and ""Uncle so-in-so"" comes up. It's okay to not have a dad, and it's okay to leave the extra men out too."
2,"ehh, not that great!",Pretty disappointed by this book it was a poor portrayal of the situation at hand and seemed to try to portray a stereotype that does not always exist. I think I will have better luck writing a book of my own.
2,"for older children, really. meh.","this book won't be appropriate for my kiddo for years and years. so, if you are a parent of a young child, save your money for about 10 years."
5,A must read for the new year!,"I read this book in 3 days and savored every page. This highly entertaining satire gets you hooked from beginning to plot twisitng end. Erik Barmack brings you into the dark side of reality TV, all the while looking deep into what people do with their identity under the spotligt. I'm so impressed, Barmack. Well done for a debut novel. Looking forward to the next one."
2,I need Prozac after reading this,"I'm quite confused by this novel. The concept of going inside a reality dating show & mocking the surrealness is great. I just feel the concept didn't hit the mark. Everthing seemed to flash by quickly and only the ending surprised me.The main character's plan of going on the show as fictional character (that would appear castworthy to the network) was novel, but it never carried out. The book would've been the same with or without that angle. It served to do nothing but add more strange elements that felt underdeveloped.I never really felt like I was there, or even ""outside looking in"" when reading this novel. I simply felt like I was reading a book with a big black rain cloud hanging over it.In short, great concept...less than perfect execution."
3,The Virgin review,"Fans of The Bachelorette will enjoy all of the behind the scenes information about Producers and their manipulations of contestants, scenes, confessionals, etc. My favorite part was the witty episode reviews that make fun of the contestants and the show a la RealityTVWorld.com's message boards.However, I had a hard time feeling any sympathy for / relating to / rooting for the protagonist Joseph / Jeb. And the twist at the end seems a little over the top, even for a parody of the ridiculousness that is Reality TV. If you're willing to suspend ""reality"", read it for the behind the scenes show information and the sarcastic episode reviews."
3,Very Disappointing...but a great satire of Reality TV,"The book works exceedingly well as a satire of reality TV (and it comes complete with a shocking ending). They get the slimy host, players, and fans down. What Barmack completely misses on is Jeb. Who is this guy? Why is he never fleshed out? He wants to change--or doesn't he? Is the point that he isn't supposed to change? I have no idea. The book left me cold and perhaps that is the point. I'm so lost--like Jeb. Thumbs up for the pop culture rants, but thumbs down on the character study."
4,The Virgin - black comedy,"The Virgin will do for the Hollywood reality TV relationship genre what Evelyn Waugh's The Loved One did for Hollywood funerals. A dark, biting, insightful story of fame-whoredom and celebrity. I recognized many of the character types and lines from The Bachelor and Bachelorette shows. There is an amazing twist at the end. An excellent read."
2,A bit stupid and childish,What sort of book is this? What person writes such a book? In this book is no thrill. But only suddenly a person dies. And then the story continue with out of any interesting parts. I think I would be able to write also such a book!
1,expensive and cheap,"Packaging was horrible, came in a plastic bag, but the pearl is beautiful and shiny, i havent yet worn it and it hasnt yet ran thru water so not sure how it will maintain itself. The chain is ok, very thin and delicate, buti anyways bought the item for the sak eof the pearl and not the chain, so its fine.i think that its a bit expensive product for the price, may have gotten it cheaper at either the JC penny clearance section or Kohls clearance section , anyways!!!UPDATE- I am wanting to reduce the stars now. I actually took so long to put in the update because of personal reasons.After wearing this chain, in about 3 days, the pearl fell off on its own some where. there was no force applied. I was actually in my office when it happened. I am very very disappointed. It was expensive to begin with and then this is the cheap stuff i get.I prevously gave 5 stars to this product, but it didnt last even a week, thats pretty sad, i am going to rate it down to 1 star."
1,GQ: What's your Gullibilty Quotient?,"Another product milking the discredited psuedo-science of numerology, but if you're the uncritical, airy-fairy type that believes in whatever comes down the pike, you'll probably be slack-jawed in amazement throughout Secrets of the Bible Code Revealed.Want to distance yourself from pseudo-scientific thinking? Pick up a copy of Sagan's Demon-Haunted World or this month's Skeptic or Skeptical Inquirer magazine."
1,Rip off,"The code of the bible?After watching what the so called ""code"" is, you'll be disapointed after knowing that it is not that espectacular and the same result can be found on books such as moby dick."
4,Nice *Exactly as describled,"Nice product exactly as described. I like the two tone shiny and matte chrome finish, has a classy look. Over time this product may show some wear and may scratch easily."
4,basic to understanding Mackenzie in Texas,"Wallace's study is a basic source for Mackenzie in Texas but is short on his life and personality in other respects. I recommend that the interested reader check out Michael D. Pierce, The Most Promising Young Officer: A Life Of Ranald S. Mackenzie (Univ. of Okla. Press, 1993) for a scholarly study of Mackenzie's life."
5,"Buy it now, please","This is probably the funniest book I've ever read. I laughed out loud at most of them. If you have a short attention span like me, buy this book, its great."
4,Mostly available online for free,"This book is very good, but if you look inside you'll see that each one-liner occupies a full page, and that leaves you feeling taken advantage of. That, plus the fact that you can search most of these quotes online."
5,years of laughs,"Every now and then I pull this book out to see if a new acquaintance has similar tastes in humour. Usually, they split a gut over this stuff. If they just look at me with a blank stare, I know we won't be seeing that much of each other. My brother bought several Deep Thoughts books for my dad years ago on Christmas. We sat around for almost 2 hours as my dad (a former minister) read these in a deadpan monotone to all of us and our kids. We were rolling. Finally, we sent the kids to bed in the living room. Next morning they told us they had been plugging their noses to keep from laughing too loud because they could hear us from the next room and didn't want us to stop reading."
3,Good book. Funny and enjoyable.,It turned out to be an O.K book. Reasonably funny but maybe I expected it to be funnier or had already read some of Jack Handey's lines. I would expect a first time reader to enjoy it more than I did.
1,Broke first 5 minutes,We bought this toy today and it does not work. The trigger to shoot would not press and release the figure. We will return it to a Toys 'R' Us store tomorrow.
3,Good overview of Quality - Too Traditional,"I will never have the Quality background of Philip Crosby, but I felt strongly that Crosby's approach was long on the old school, prior to America's turnaround in Quality in the Mid 80s.Look at how American cars have improved in quality over the last 20 years. From our cars just barely holding together in the 80s to the great cars from the big three, all because we used new methods to get to quality.His methodology is more of the 50s and 60s military style of management. His quality method was inspection after the fact, not elimination of defects before the product is made.This a good book as a basic study in quality and understanding why managers have the approaches they have. It is traditional and will appeal mostly to 'old school' quality methods."
3,A Classic - In a Dual Sense,"A classic in both the best and worst sense. Phil Crosby is very readable, and his case study approach to Zero Defects implementation brings the management of quality to an understandable level. However, the book was written back in 1979, and it shows. The tools are dated, and many of the items noted by Crosby as implementation and employee motivation techniques are a bit worn. The management is timeless, the tools are not. Good background - but not as great as it must have been 25 years ago."
1,Mad about You MISTAKE,What I don't think the powers that be realized is when the show ended with Paul and Jamie divorced...that killed the show and any want to watch it over and over. My wife and I taped every episode on our vhs... but when the show ended with the two of them ended it ruined ever single episode... what a tragic and stupid ending... and they wonder why no-one ran out and bought the DVD's... awful. They should have protected the show instead of being edgy and ruining it.
5,Still Waiting For Season 4!!,"I hadn't checked to see if season 4 of MAY was available for about 6 months, but my birthday is coming up and I thought it would make a great gift.... but NO!!! Still no season 4!! This is really ridiculous!!!! Loyal fans have been waiting and waiting for years for the complete series. I agree wholeheartedly with others observations that idiotic shows that ended well after MAY have been released, but for some unknown reason we cannot get out MAY! Come on SONY!! Help a fan out!!"
4,I love it!,"I love it. This product is great for on the go moms who have to take their breast milk along. It really keeps the breast milk cold for a long time. The only thing that I realized is that it keeps it so cold, when baby is ready for a feed it might be a bit too cold, so what I did was carry my breast milk bags in it. I also carried a thermos of hot water so that when baby is hungry I just thaw it out in the thermos then put it into the bottle to feed her. Other than that it is a great product and I love it"
3,Remember when?,"After just now discovering the talent of Engelbert, i am playing catch up. This DVD is like a walk back in time to the days when he sang on variety and talk shows. Most of the footage are almost carbon copies of each other where he walks out and stands there and sings (beautifully) his latest release. While this is not the best of the Engelbert DVDs (Engelbert Live...is) it still is a great walk down memory lane, back to when singers could actually sing and were not electronically enhanced and manufactured."
4,soñar en cubano,"Me gusto mucho, la forma agradable, interesante y entretenida como la autora logra envolverte en la obra. Es una realidad que sufre y vive el pueblo Cubano. pienso que todo latino con sentido de soilidaridad debe leerlo."
2,No se sostiene!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"En verdad inicié la lectura con muchas expectativas y reconozco que soy una lectora muy exigente , no sólo en cuanto al relato en sí, sino también al uso del leguaje, la construccion en fin me gusta disfrutar de una buena historia bien contada. Esta historia, no se sostiene,no logró mantener mi atención, es cierto que son varias historia juntas, pero hubo momentos en que no entendía bien la relacion entre una historia y la otra, además de la relación de parentezco entre los personajes.Le doy dos estrellas porque tiene chispazos que le hacen a uno creer que la historia arrancará."
3,Hmmm...,I might have liked a slightly stronger adhesive on these (it's a press-and-stick sort of removable-bond) - and in fact the type where you peel off a covering to expose a more permanent adhesive surface would have been nice - but at the price for the quantity they are all right. Handy for stacking and marking your cash so that the robbers may more easily count out their take when they arrive back at the hideout!
1,Not enough adhesive!,These wrappers need more (stronger) adhesive...not nearly enough to stick together. I ended up using some double stick tape to get wrappers to hold together.
4,Excellent,"This a really good DVD for beginners trying to get into matte painting. It shows 6 pieces from start to finish as Dylan Cole paints and talks about the process as he goes. I learnt a lot from this DVD about choosing your colour palette, lighting a scene and atmospheric perspective. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone starting off in matte painting...I've already purchased Dylan's next one."
2,Magnetic 12 volt trailer lite kit.,The item I received was made in Tiawan---It did not come with a 4 pin connetor as advertized but with 3 loose pins and a ground clip. Upon connecting to my RV's 4pin connector nothing worked right. I orginally thought the problem was in the RV but decided to check out the lite kit's wiring first----good thing as I found almost everything mis wired. green and yellow to the low intensity filiment and brown brown to the high intensity. The white ground wires were connected to the brown running lights wire. After I completely rewired the product and crimped on a proper 4 pin connector it worked OK.
2,Very poorly balanced.,"Over all this book isnt worth the purchase. The ""new"" races require signifigant adjustment to either bring them into acceptable PC power levels or large adjustments in the ECL. At first I thought the core classes might save this book but I was mistaken. They too are extremely over powered. Aditionally the prestige classes are just plain silly. Even the spells are over powered. The only reason for the 2nd star is that it has some neat ideas, making it a seed book for a DM that wants to add some spice to his game world."
5,The Best Astaire Book,"Probably the best book on Fred Astaire's career, this has everything, including frame-by-frame analyses of each of his dances. Mueller is obviously a fan, and sometimes finds things to praise in films that are actually pretty dull (""The Sky's the Limit,"" ""Belle of New York""). But unlike most movie books, this one is fully thought-out, beautifully written, and just about exhaustive. Even the footnotes and appendices make entertaining reading."
5,Best Book for Astaire's Dancing Artistry,"Mueller's book is uniquely about Fred Astaire's dancing movies.All of them. One for each chapter. He covers almost every dance, and analyzes them in such detail as only a dancer, perhaps, can appreciate. I read this book a chapter a day, and watched almost all the movies. The book can be tedious in its detail, but his comments on the dances you've seen and the stories behind the scenes add to your understanding of the films and how they were made. He sees things you don't see in a first viewing of a film. Mueller's commentary can also be heard in several of the film DVDs as a special feature. He says less about Astaire's singing: he was a great interpreter of so many standards that were written for him. There was none better in expression of the lyric. Perhaps someone should write a book on his singing, which was a part of his great artistry."
5,Good Table lamp,I purchased this lamp for my bed room night stand table. It works great allowing me to move the neck for better lighting.
2,"Not white, more like yellow...also not very bright get silver-star instead","ok 1st i swapped these out for a set of my oem bulbs, yes there a bit brighter and a bit whiter then stock but that was all...plus thoes bulbs are 7.99 for a 2 pack.. these are $40+I also order a pack of the Sylvania H1 SilverStar which are $20 less expecting them just to be like the oem bulbs.... but no those bubs which only cost only 20 and were twice as bright as these and where WHITE unlike these....just don't waste your money because of the name"
5,"Great bulb, very similar to HID",This bulb flashes really white color and has very high output.. Very similar to my HID bulbs. I like it
2,A Bit Disappointed,"I thought when I bout these bulbs that they were 110 W bulbs. I took that away from the discreption. But, they are actually 55 W bulbs and I already had those bulbs."
1,Great if you like blue lights,"Bought the lights for the PIAA quality, but they are no more than cheap blue bulbs. They give off no light and make it hard to see at night."
3,Please think twice...,"The bulbs are tinted blue, it was a good start. Installation was easy but at the time the lights were on...uppps almost nothing changed.Those bulbs are overated, perhaps they will last for a long time but think is better to save the money and go straight for HIDs...definitly no bulb, despite of the price and look, can compare with those.My car is a Forester XT 2006."
2,"Better than stock, but not worth $$$",Waste of money. These were a slight improvement over the lights that were in my car and this could have just been because they were getting old. Don't waste your money. Buy cheap stock lights or HID's
1,Classic can't use this cable!,The Product Description says compatible with the iPod Classic -- IT IS NOT! The iPod does not even recognize the cable. The iPod keeps asking for the appropriate cable to be plugged in. It does work with the 5G video iPod.
2,Product seems correct but doesn't work as expected???,This product arrived quickly fits everything I plug it into put I was under the impression that it would transfer your Ipod data to a standard television set. Everyone I have tried I get sound but no picture.There were no real instruction with the unit and I have not found anyone who can show me a way to plug it in other than using the color connector to color connectors on TV but still all you get is sound.Unless you have seen one used and know exactly how to make it work I would not buy as I cannot make mine work. I don't believe it is user error but without an instruction sheet to follow I can only match color to color and hope it works.Send me the instructions for use and I will give you a new rating.
1,Does not work!,This cable simply does not work with any of the iPods on the market today. I would recommend that you purchase Apple's Composite Cable from their website because the chance of that working is 100%.
1,horible-usless,I was soooo exited then it came and I plugged it in and it did not work then I tried 6 other plugs and pressed every button on the clicker and nothing happened :(
1,Worthless.,"Didn't work, did absolutley nothing. Don't buy this, it will not do anything! Waste of my money and time. Worthless."
3,iPhone compatability,"Wouldn't work with my 3Gs or my 4S. Maybe will work with a different product. Looks like it ""should"" work with something else, not an extremely cheaply made product. Just doesn't work with what I have."
1,Not compatible with iPod Classic or Touch,"I was looking for a portable converter that could travel with me as well as something that would work with a video switcher. Using a 160 GB Classic I can get Audio only. Regardless of the settings for video out, the device waits for the correct cable and will not work. The same applies to an 8 GB Touch.I tried plugging the cable into a dock as well, but no luck.A case getting what you pay for...."
1,I was TOTALLY misled.,"This product does not work with any ipod made past the iPod 5th generation. I tried it with my classic (6th generation) And realized that after shipping costs, I had just thrown away 10 dollars."
3,Great Product... not for nano 3g,"This cables work great.. but if you have a nano 3g, try other cables, this one doesnt work for that"
3,not as good as I had hoped,the tips of my nails are a little whiter but the pink part is now lilac colored. I won't purchase again.
3,Doesnt perform as well as I would like,"I held out great hope for the product. It goes on smoothly and the first coat dries lighting fast! The first coat doesnt provide much coverage for yellowing or ridge reduction, but once I put on the 2nd coat I thought ""wow, this stuff is great."" It does have a lavendar tinge to it as well, but I didnt mind that. Unfortunately the next day the product began to peel off and not just a little, like half of it peeled from each one of my nails. They looked horrible. I thought it was a fluke and tried it again. The same thing happened. So if you are just looking for help for an evening out, it's great but the next day it will look bad. Also it doesnt not remove with regular nail polish remover you have to purchase pure acetone."
5,A well-crafted metaphysical reference book,"Donald Watson brings his extraordinary insight and clarity to this first-rate reference book of spiritual and metaphysical topics. Watson takes care to present both the meaning and the value of each idea in this well-illustrated book. Concepts from many different cultures and time periods are well represented, so this book is fun to read cover-to-cover just for the joy of learning about various metaphysical perspectives and practices. More than five hundred entries are described in sufficient detail to satisfy initial curiosity and to pique further interest."
1,Waterloo ML777 Tool Chest,"After reading reviews on this toolbox my expectations were high. I was very disappointed in the quality of this toolbox when it arrived. It reminded me of the cheap toolboxes I have seen around at bargin prices. It was dented from shipping, the drawers seem cheap, the metal is not heavy enough. I was tempted to return it, but needed it, so just kept it. I decided buying something of this nature needs to be inspected before committing to buy. I ended up buying the lower half of my setup at Menards. Spent more, but the quality was well worth it."
3,"GEORGE SAND, MYTH OR IMAGINATION","An overblown and too sympathetic depiction of a woman said to have had numerous flaws, indiscretions, and self-inflicted mis-fortunes. Surely those of us who have studied her elsewhere know of her selfish acts, uninhibited behaviour and ravenous sex drive. Forthright portrayal of this extraordinary woman was lacking, and clearly Ms. Jack played it safe. For feminist sake? However I commend Jack in highlighting Sand's genius. In this regard, she hit the mark."
1,Don't buy this. It's fake.,"This was a documentary originally produced for TNT. All of the footage that is supposedly ""real KGB UFO footage"" is fake."
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"Sorry to burst your collective bubbles, but the ""real"" footage contained herein is in NO WAY real. The ugly truth is simply this: the producers of this program hired a small crew (including one of the assistant editors) who shot all of the Russian footage segements, and the autopsy. It's all fake, shot in The Valley, and I personally know two people who were involved in the charade. Even worse, much of the other footage in this ""documentary"" was not licensed from its owners, and is thus STOLEN. The worst, absolutely, the worst kind of garbage. Just because this was shown on television doesn't make it real."
1,Phony Baloney,"The ""crashed flying saucer"" is set up like a tombstone in a graveyard. Any object this big, that crashed with enough force to bury itself halfway into the ground (as depicted) would have made a huge crater - and knocked the surrounding trees down. I guess the backhoe needed to create a convincing scene couldn't be squeezed into the producers' budget."
2,Not for Razor Scooter,"My son's razor scooter grips were falling apart - guess that's what happens when they put foam grips on. So, I searched on Amazon for new ones. I knew I didn't want foam, so we went with these. It did say that they would work with Razor. They are extremely hard to get on - which is OK since you don't want them falling off. However, they are too long. They stick out about an inch and a half. We haven't put them to an outdoor test, but I'm imagining the end that sticks out beyond the actual handle will be cut from the metal rubbing. The end caps that come with the grips do not stay in - they're not essential, but do give it a nice finished look. Perhaps they can be glued in? For the price, they work well, but I guess next time, I'll ask for measurements."

5,One of the best Series!,Despite the no extras part. I still love the show and I willnot sell my DVD set(s). I used ta watch Mac' with my Gradfatherwhen I was little and I utterly loved the show and now itsfinally comming out on DVD. I'm Very happy. I'm going to getevery set. I really love Mac!
2,gift for someone else.,i personally dont like macgyver...im a girl and from this generation..i bought this for my dad 'cause he likes stuff like this. he watched it as soon as it came. so i guess he likes it :p
5,MacGyver ROCKS!!,"If you had any idea how long we fans have waited for this DVD series, how many petitions we signed- all I can say is WOW!!I am thrilled to finally have ALL the episodes I have missed in one great spot.The quality of the episodes is not always the greatest but considering the fact we got them at all I am not complaining.I heard a lot of the DVD's are not running right but returning them is the best thing. Mine have been ok so far.There is and never will be another MacGyver.Richard we love you!!a PROUD MacList member!"
1,Disappointed,"This is not Wolinsky's best effort.First, it needs serious editing.Second, this is just a re-packaging of the current pop psychology thinking. Wolinsky adds to the confusion by adding another component. Instead of YOU acting out on unconscious urges, Wolinsky introduces 'Inner Child' and 'Hypnosis'... so NOW the Inner Child HYPNOTIZES you into acting out on unconscious urges.What's his answer? The same as the old psycho-analytic approach: awareness. When you can become CONSCIOUSLY aware of the processes and the relationships then *poof* they are resolved!I was disappointed that this ""Quantum Psychology"" expert put so little thought or effort into this book. If you have any education in the area of psychology, this is a waste of your time."
1,ILLEGAL,This appears to be an illegal dub from China. The simpsons have not released more than 10 seasons on DVD yet. Do not support this pirate by buying this garbage.update: it seems like the seller has changed this product. My review was made when it was a bootlegged simpsons dvd set.
5,Only glossy paper you can use for samsung,I used the HP laser Photo paper with my Samsung CPL 310 and It came out horrible. The ink melted off and everything. I consalted my user manual and it says Only glossy paper you can use with this particular paper is the glossy brocher paper. if you have similar problems I would try the brochure paper.
5,"Great price, Great paper","I was pleasantly surprised with this paper - I ordered it, along with some other ""brochure"" paper options that cost considerably more. This is just as good for my purposes, small run newsletters for my wine club. I ran it on two different Canon ink jet printers using their number ""8"" ink. Very high quality, sharp images and text."
1,"Pan-American Exposition ""Official views""","If you are interested in seeing Charles Dudley Arnold's photographs of the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, NY, you will be sorely disappointed by this book. Instead of crisp, clear reprints of his photos, all you'll get here are muddy, poorly printed photocopies (one per page). You are much, much better off searching for scanned images of the fair available for free on line. The reprints in the book are truly awful."
2,disappointing,hard to be disappointed by the Stones but this was a lot less interesting than I initially thought whe I ordered it. Apart from the novelty of seeing them at the very start when theya lot yunger this is not worth purchasing alas.
3,littleboots,"Sullivan was great. His show is a little dated, and corny, but as for the stones themselves, this is a historical record at best. Their perfomances are a bit lame, come on ""Let's spend SOME TIME together? Jim Morrison didn't compromise his integrity when the Doors played Sullivan. These shows are for die hards only."
1,Bafflling...,"I seem to be the first baffled reviewer thus far. Five stars? Come off it!Obviously, live performances by the Rolling Stones from the mid to late 60's are essential...but did the producers have to force us to sit through all of the other stuff as well? The ""Ed Sullivan Show"" was all but unwatchable...I know. I grew up avoiding it! The only times worth watching were when Elvis and the Beatles appeared. I didn't even KNOW that the Stones appeared on the show this often (like I said, I avoided it like the plague). Topo Gigio? Ughhhh!""The Beatles 1st US Visit"" could have been released in the very same fashion....thank heavens it wasn't.Hopefully, the Stones appearances on Sullivan will ultimately be released without the rest of this junk....I'll wait till then.I hope others will do the same..."
1,Not as advertised,"Watched the first Sullivan show in this set from 10/25/64. For a live show, it sure looks edited. And apparently it is. Multiple web sources list the actual guests on this episode. Missing from the DVD version are Jack Jones and the Cambridge Circus, a proto-Python group with John Cleese and Graham Chapman, among others. What really gives the game away is a segment with Phyllis Diller in which comes out and announces that it's Mothers' Day. Perhaps rights could not be cleared or sections of the master tape haven't survived well, but this episode at least does not seem to be as it originally aired. Buyer beware."
5,The very best of Stones live DVDs,"I have been a Rolling Stones fan since 1964, I got all Stones albums, studio or live versions,I rated this Stones DVD, recorded during the 60's area is the VERY best of all Stones live. PeriodAny Stones fan must have this DVD and compare with others, this one, to me ,is even better than their Gimme Shelter DVD."
5,Nice,"As mentioned, the performances themselves are sometimes a bit short and you better be somewhat excited to watch the whole Sullivan Show (commercials and all).Overall we have enjoyed it though-- a nice collection."
1,Chopped up & not complete,I thought these were the original unedited complete episodes. They're not. Totie Fields has a segment that only runs 2 and a half minutes. Shame on them.
2,meh,"the sword looks cool, butits not made for sparing, or much of anything else. all in all it will break if you use it."
1,More than a bit of bias ...,"Not only does Krause have people he know writing positive reviews, but he has also spammed the parenting boards on AOL with ads touting his own book ... but he doesn't indicate in the ads that he's shilling for HIMSELF!"
1,A little biased don't you think?,"Chelsea from ""Texas"" is a student in one of Tom Krause's classes. A little biased don't you think? Personally I didn't like the book at all. Way too many sappy, made-up stories. But if that's your thing, go for it."
4,A Different Age But Still Entertaining,"It may have been the turning of a different century, but it was also the turning of the era of popular song and the fledgling Tin Pan Alley industry. There are insights to music that you may remember from your childhood (March of the Toys), and comedy from the era (Please Let Me Sleep and Nobody). But even more, there are certain social issues that have changed very little over time (She Was Happy Till She Met You, I'd Leave Ma Happy Home For You) and one number in particular from English theatre that is seething with entendre (Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow-Wow). While these are not the most memorable of the era's pieces, they are well worth looking at again, and hardly a waste of your hard-earned entertainment dollars."
3,They smell like sheep,"This is an excellent scriptural primer on the subject of pastoral shepherding. I recommend this to anyone involved in leadership in any church. Not only will this book inspire you, it will also instruct you concerning the Scriptural basis for pastoring in the world wide church."
3,An easy yet challenging read,They Smell Like Sheep: Spiritual Leadership for the 21st CenturyA very well written work with many examples
5,Great Book,Fantastic reading for you that are Pastoring in need of a fresh and effective perspective in your leadership/pastoral position.Must read!
5,A great primer for all Christian leaders,Anderson lays down practical guidelines for Christian leadership in practical terms. He breaks down the book into useful sections such as mentoring. There's plenty in the book for you even if you aren't a leader in the church because the book provides excellent hints for reaching the lost and your Christian friends. My personal favorite part of the book was the great way that Mr. Anderson weaves practical experience into the rugged world of Christian leadership.
4,Qualities of the TRUE Shepherd,"With sufficient depth for any theologian, but as down to earth as the parables of Jesus, this is a book that will inspire and challenge church leadership.The premise is startling in its simplicity -- The true shepherd spends a lot of time in the field with his sheep -- so much time that he smells like them. The true leader who models his life after Christ spends a great deal of time wherever his people are.Shepherding, according to Dr. Anderson, includes the dust and sweat and smell of the field.This is an easy book to read, a difficult and challenging book to implement."
5,I LOVE J.B.,"J. Berk, i promise, i won't give your name away. But there're only four books left!!! and no one has reviewed it! the man that wrote these tales is one of my very best friends, some might go so far as to call us twins, and maybe we are in some wierd metaphysical sense; and if my twin can be my copy shop hero, this guy is my hero, he has rescued me from evil college hatboys and creepy photographer stalkers in used bookstores in eastern pennsylvania on many an occasion. read his tales. someone in L.A. is selling a copy for $198, need i say more about the value of this ringbound craphouse press vintage gem? does craphouse press doodoo second printings?? Four of you out there, and five if you've got the dough, still have a chance at a jolly romp through depravity.yours truly and forever,I.S."
3,Achieving Career Success on your Terms,It's a general guid but it did not hit on the day to day struggles of a black women in an all white corporation. Iwould recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about what NIA would do.
1,Worst Drivel,"Although a much published author, this book is the worst drivel I have ever read. Although it has good Christian values, the authors can't even follow their own story line. Perpertual contradictions of events suggest they need someone to proof read prior to publication. Fictionally set in 1800's the dialogue is 1980's+. A terrible disappointment to read."
4,The Best Concise Work on Systematic/Historical Theology,"Dorman provides an excellent overview of theology. Ultimately written from an evangelical perspective, the author includes historical developments that are both Catholic and Protestant, providing an accurate picture of the history of Christian doctrine. The book is great for those looking for the essence of the Christian faith in every major doctrinal area. A few areas are a bit skimpy, but overall he covers the theologies (Soteriology, Angelology, Eschatology, etc.) very well."
3,Not so bad,"Well this DVD is quite good, but there's couple dissappointments, I was at one of her concerts but she didn't sound like in this DVD, I mean this DVD has to many audio modifications, and I know it's live DVD, but it almost doesn't sound like live. At some places there's a little desynchronization.Video is great, but audio not so much."
3,hmm,"Ok, The Best Damn Tour was like the best damn tour she had so far, but this DVD is somewhat disappointing. Her voices are way too much produced and sounds really unnatural and different from her live performances. I know everybody does that when they release DVD but this one could've been much much better if they just kept her voice LIVE a little (like her first DVD). Some people may like it because it sounds almost perfect, but come on, what's the point of buying LIVE conert DVD? I don't think she sounded so terrible in the actual concert that they had to edit her voice for the entire concert."
5,LOVE IT!,i went to this concert and wanted to see it again. so i had to get this. and im really happy i did!
5,AMAZING DVD,"This DVD rocks! The sounds quality is amazing! The camera work was excellent! As you watch, you feel like you're actually at the concert! I love watching this DVD! GREAT WORK AVRIL! A previous review said that the DVD had been entirely dubbed after filming. This statement would be incorrect. Avril's crew REALLY cared about the sound quality of this DVD because the sound was recorded straight from the mic (which is quite an expensive process). All the little black stars (Avril fans) should own this EXCELLENT concert DVD!"
5,avril lavigne-live,"concert full of lots of energy and put together very well! two thumbs up,way up! 20-stars-avril lavigne rocks!"
1,Don't buy from this vendor,"I ordered Politics In America, Texas Edition. I was sent the generic edition (not the Texas Edition that I need for my class.). I emailed the vendor numerous times and did not hear back until I filed an a to z claim with Amazon. After filing the claim, the vendor finally emailed back wanting to know if I wanted to return it (apparently at my own expense even though I was not to blame for the vendor sending the wrong item), for a full refund. I have since emailed twice asking for return information but the vendor has not deemed it important enough to respond. I would definitely recommend that you stay away from this vendor. It only responded when I filed a claim and is obviously not interested in resolving this matter."
5,Great Deal!,This is a serious seller who tries best to satisfy customers.I strongly recommend him.p.s. The product is like new.
3,London Elektricity - Power Ballads,"London Elektricity's POWER BALLADS kicks off with the chaotic jazz of ""Out of This World"" that flounders for a moment until Liane Carroll comes in to smooth things out (similarly, she adds some funk to ""Remember the Future""). ""Power Ballad"" keeps its strings surging forth, but most of the album seems to ease on by. Luckily the easy-listening sample that dots ""The Strangest Secret In The World"" and the horns and wailing vocals on ""Hanging Rock"" inject some personality, as does the tenderness of ""The Mustard Song"" and the harmonics of ""Vapour Trails."" Good, but not spectacular."
4,Grossly under-estimated blues performer,I first saw Bryan Lee performing at the 2000 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and was left wondering why I hadn't heard of him before. He's obviously been around for a while and can play the blues in a unique style that's his own. I recommend any CD's of his and this latest one has him playing & singing even better than before.
2,"Bryan Lee, Live and Dangerous","Although I am a big Bryan Lee fan, this is not his best work. The ""Friday Night"" and ""Saturday Night"" as still his best live CD's."
1,MP3 BUYER BEWARE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS,"I discovered The Braille Blues Daddy on SiriusXm's Bluesville and decided to download some of his stuff. Had no problem with any of the stuff I got...except this one. The music is great (of course) but technical problems begin a few minutes in on Track 7 (Hug Me 'Til it Hurts) and continues through to the end. It sounds like a combination of ""white noise"" and a cd skipping (?). Essentially rendering this release unlistenable in this format. Amazon has been very dilligent (sp?) in attempting to solve the technical issues but to no avail (this has been an ongoing situation for a few months now as of this writing). Today I got a complete refund on the purchase price and previousily had gotten a couple of mp3 credits for the inconvenience. Naturally, I'd rather have the music, but thought I should warn MP3 shoppers."
3,Its OK,"If you are into City Building Sims, you will enjoy this game. Otherwise, don't bother. There is absolutely no challenge here. You build businesses and houses, but the worst thing that happens is you make no money. A failing business or empty house does not lose money. Even though you own the business, you cannot set prices, either. Furthermore, you are given missions, some of which the computer players will complete for you. There is no time limit on any of them. Progressing through the game unlocks different neighborhoods until you have all of Manhattan available; even though I finished the game, I never figured out what causes the next neighborhood to unlock. The manual is useless. There are a few bugs, such as missing textures (my doormen appear as grey boxes and some of my pennants say ""default texture"" on them.)"
5,THIS IS A COOL GAME,TYCOON NEW YORK CITY IS A COOL GAME. YOU CAN BUILD NEW YORK CITY ANY WHAY YOU WANT AND HAVE LOTS OF MONEY. THIS GAME WILL KEEP YOU FROM DOING ANYTHING ELSE FOR AWHILE BECAUSE IT WILL CONSUME YOU AND YOU DO NOT WANT TO QUIT PLAYING FOR HOURS.I LOVE THIS GAME.
2,BORING,"The game looks great, but besides that there isn't a single positive thing I can say about it. The camera control is atrocious, there doesn't seem to be a point to playing it, and it froze up even though my system surpasses the minimum requirements. Why bother building things when all you do is click on a plot of land, watch the building magically appear, and then if you want, add little touches like billboards or bushes? It's just boring. There's no kind of challenge to be found here; it's just click an empty space build a building. Completely pointless."
1,Old Game Even Older Graphics,"This was not a good game at all. It is old and accomodates old graphics cards and drivers and not the ones used today. I think it is time for the seller to retire this, throw it out and cut your losses before they get a reputation for selling old stuff that does not work well."
1,Problematic...,"The game is cool, in and of itself. I love building in NYC.BUT... the problem is that this game shuts down everytime the computer does any sort of automatic update. If Windows wants to update (or any antivirus programs... or any other plethora of programs that want to update every other week on modern computers) it shuts down the game and you lose anything you haven't saved yet. I shouldn't have to shut down ALL automatic updates everytime I want to play the game. I play other games, including Tycoon games, Sim games, and all sorts of others, and have NEVER had such a problem. It makes the game unusable... which makes it totally lame. If I could return this, I would."
1,I'm a Critic,"This game stinks, if I could give it 0 stars, I would. It doesn't even work on my computer! And my computer is a Windows XP! Take my advice, and DO NOT buy this product, you're better off with the game Zoo Empire. Zoo Empire works great and is tons of fun! Again, Tycoon City: New York is a horrible game. Please take my advice, and don't buy this game."
5,Very Effective Product,"These shields work great to block dust from semi-metallic brake pads. Be sure to follow the installation instructions and figure out what you are doing before placing the shields. I installed a set myself originally with no problems. Recently, I had a brake job done and the shop removed the shields and pretty much tore them up! They did offer to replace them, so I ordered another set. I allowed them to install the replacement shields and they only placed one of four correctly. I suppose they weren't paying attention. They even commented they were hard to install since they were so thick(huh?). (So much for ASE qualified ""technicians"") As it turns out, if you use ceramic pads the dust is white and is hardly noticeable. So it's a good product, but maybe not necessary for some circumstances."
5,The Raven Stone,This book is written with an extra ordinary command of our English language. Mr. Viets has very special insight to the human conscious. What an eloquent writer.
3,Not great... but close.,"Overall the canisters feel a little cheaper than I thought they would. You twist the lids to reveal shaker and pour style holes, which is nice. Unfortunately though some of the lids are nice and tight feeling, others are very loose and certainly wouldn't keep a fine spice like cinnamon from leaking out."
1,Quality issues,"I bought 9 sets of these for a total of 54 canisters. Out of 54 canisters: 9 do not stay closed: 4 have problems getting the lid to come off; 6 keep falling off the backing when we open the refrigerator door: I have ""lost"" 7 canisters to falling off the fridge and breaking apart, not to mention the cost of the spice now wasted. WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN. It looks gorgeous on the fridge and the concept is good, but the quality and design are horrible... I'll use these until I find something else for a reasonable cost to replace."
5,Jaw Dropping performances,"As a budding percussionist, I borrowed this video from my instructor, and was blown away. I just viewed the Vinnie Colaiuta solo from that video on www.drummerworld.com, and the effect is still the same. These three drummers, Dave Weckl, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Steve Gadd, are true virtuosos of the drum set. Each did their own set, usually consisting of two songs, and a blazing solo. Then, the concert culminated when all three drummers took part in a three way battle royale. Gadd layed the groove down, and then each drummer soloed over the top of that groove. To end, the three drummers syncronized what they were playing, came center stage, and hugged. Awww. Nevertheless, this video is definitely inspirational for any drummer; I highly recommend it."
5,Amazing product!! :),"Using it with my Canon Powershot SX 210 IS, thanks to reviewer Stephen's recommendation, and it fits perfectly! I have yet to drop the case or get it wet so I can't offer any thoughts on that, but I love it and will definitely look towards Lowepro for my future shopping needs! Perfect product!"
3,Lowepro Camera case,"Excellent product. I bought this for a Canon Powershot SX120S. It is a tight fit, not easy to put away or take out quickly. Otherwise, very nice product."
4,Easy to follow. Easy to learn.,"There are many reasons to recommend this product. What I liked best is that during the ""practice"" portion at the end, the screen did not go blank or have some pop up. The dance instructors still did the moves with you. They still counted it out, but they did so using more of a behind the scenes method.The instruction is based on the first DVD. If you already know and are comfortable with this type of dance, feel free to jump to the second. They did cover quite a bit in the first DVD that is still used here. A very good job. I enjoyed it quite a bit.My only drawback is that Shawn is very dry to listen to. Though he is good at dancing and very knowledgable about the subject, he is not excited about it. It reminds me of a lecture hall in college. Other than that, I liked it. I will be purchasing more of their stuff."
3,missing...,what no 'KISS THEM FOR ME'??? so what if it's their most commercial hit and maybe they're sick of playing it or selling out or whatever. it's a great great song!!ERIC ALVER
5,"siouxsie - chopped and screwed.,","yup, she drops it all an octave and throws in some scratchin'.gotta love it."
2,What's the point??,"I saw Siouxsie live on the ""Itch"" tour in San Francisco and my jaw dropped when I realised she couldn't hit the high notes. She was completely off key in some songs. They might have fixed this on the cd - you know these live cd's are actually rerecorded in the studio later-. But obviously her voice is not the same. Musically, if I remember there were only 3 instrumentalists, with the one guitar player having to play in a way that ""filled"" as much space as he could, instead of being able to play in a way that creates ""ambience"" like on their studio albums. Another dissapointment is that the album doesnt really have a strong ""new"" song in it! I mean after all these years, they could have written one new song! Few weeks after I saw the ""Itch"" tour, I went and saw ""Midight Oil"" live and thought to myself: ""now this is realy good live performance and not that Siouxsie chick!""."
1,Not trustworthy,"This book is so full of errors that I absolutely do not trust it. Mistakes include grammatical errors, index not matching text, and inaccurate substantive context. Nor does it add anything new. Most of the information could be more accurately obtained from more trustworthy sources. Much better books on the topic are available."
1,disappointing,"This book is not only badly written but in some cases, grossly incorrect. It is by no means comprehensive, nor does it even sufficiently cover what it purports to cover. I was very disappointed by it, and I hope those who are serious about learning about Bipolar Disorder look elsewhere. It is almost scary to know that this book is available. There are a number of much better books out there that are more accurate and useful."
3,Of course it was the Purple shaker,I was dissapointed that I got a purple shaker since I bring it to work to have a pre-workout shake. I guess I can't complain because Colors Vary. Love the small bottle to be more compact and limit my water intake. When I shake nothing comes out which is good. Just wished it was any other color.
5,Great Size!,"Service and shipment fast. These are the best blender bottles out there, and this is a wonderful size to take to work."
5,The one color I didn't want haha!,"These bottles are great for pre-workout drinks or protein shakes and the coil ball really helps to de-clump everything. When I seen ""Colors may vary"", I assumed it would be one of the 5 shown on the item picture (Purple,green,yellow,blue,and red). After having joked around with a friend about getting a pink one and then reassuring it wouldn't happen, sure enough, a pink one shows up in the box. Just my luck Haha"
4,lid snap too difficult for me to open,I love the size and quality -- mixes things well. My problem is my fingers are not strong enough to open or shut the little flap on top. I give it to my husband to do each time and he struggles with it. The good thing is that it is a good fit and doesn't leak. The size is perfect for my needs. I'm hoping the flap losens up eventually.
5,"So easy to clean, no plastic taste, rugged.","I bought the smaller of the Blender Bottles (20 oz instead of 28) because all I need it for it to mix juice with flaxseed oil and soy lecithin in the mornings (good for B blood types). I didn't want the giant bottle because it just wasn't necessary. I received a hot pink blender bottle. I'm not too keen on the color, and I wish that you could select which color you want, but hey, it's functional, and that's what I needed it for. Hot water shaken up in the bottle two or three times is sufficient to clean it; I have yet to see anything cling to the whisk ball inside. The flip-cap for the hole on the top is tight and makes a definite SNAP when you close it, but it's easy to open. The cap itself has strong threads that are not likely to cross-thread. It seems pretty damn indestructible.Great design, easy to clean, and doesn't impart a plastic taste on your drink. Highly recommended."
5,Single 20oz Sundesa Blender Bottles- Great Product!,"I ordered three of the Single 20oz Sundesa Blender Bottles, and must say they work very well. I ordered the bottles for protein shakes, but my boyfriend has began to use them for Crystal Light drink powder mix. The blender ball quickly transforms the powder and water into a smooth, refreshing beverage. As an added plus, the bottles are dishwasher safe."
4,It's a shake bottle...what more do you need?,"This shake bottle includes a whisk ball and also has liquid measuring lines on the side for easy water measuring before taking your shake. Just be sure to add the liquid before the powder for easier mixing. I would have given it 5 stars, but I would have liked to be able to choose my own color."
5,perfect,I drink shakes twice a day as meal replacements and blender bottles are perfect for shakes in the go I really like them
4,A Good Thing,"I use these shakers for my Protein shakes. They work well. One disadvantage...the little ball on the inside is a separate piece, so you have to keep track of it following washing because if you lost it, it wouldn't really be any good."
1,Can anyone measure?,"Ordered this bottle. Description said it's 20oz. bottle, but what I got clearly shows that it is only 13.52oz. or 400ml. The picture of the item is correct but the description says 20oz. Doesn't anyone pay attention to the gradient on the side of the bottle? Clearly 400ml or 13.52 fluid ounces. Someone needs to fix the picture to match the description or change the description to match the picture or better yet pay attention to what you're selling... is that too much to ask? Sadly the answer may be yes."
4,Ice cubes work just as good,"These kind of blender bottles do work good, but you can use any shaker bottle and put 2 ice cubes in and have the same effect."
2,Only 12 ounces,I already wrote a review for this item saying that the measurement on it is not what the picture shows and it leaks. I then got a rude e mail from the company because I left a low review. I DO NOT RECOMMEND buying anything from this company.
5,Classical Treasures - March Favorites,Love it....It gets your blood flowing. Brings back fond memories of marching in a band.
4,This Book is a classic! Pick Up on It! Tom Valentine's best to date in twenty books!,"Search For Health is the five year magazine thatTom Valentine published at his Carotec, Inc. Co.that now prodouces the very good Midas ReportTrue Health show, on 9.985 and 9.970 mhz, short-wave one, WWCR, Mondays and Wednesdays, 3-4 p.m.And the very good True HealthNewsletter that is published six times a year.All topics are covered including the phony SeaSilver, which many Patriots are being scammed onnow and the very overrated Essiac. A very easyto read Health Primer and covers the dietaryhealth industry thoroughly."
3,Disappointing,"A beautiful recording that brings out details I hadn't heard before in this symphony, but the performance, as a whole, lacks the thrust and momementum I'm looking for in this piece. The first movement isn't relentless and the third movement almost reaches a point of statis. I like Yalblonsky a lot as a conductor (sample his Mayskovsky recordings on Naxos), but this one is a real disappointment."
2,Not for the faint at heart,"This book goes into viewing not only the glamorous part of the commendattore's life, but mostly the darker side.Mr Yates takes a very interesting position, he gives the impression that dislikes italians and praises germans, english and americans in the auto industry, and that this book was written to expose the ""dark-side"" of Ferrari.The linking of Enzo Ferrari to the Mafia and to the Fascist governments seems a little far fetched.All in all I believe this book was written to discredit Ferrari and all the history and triumph behind them."
1,"If I could have awarded no stars, I'd have done it.","This is one of the worst videos I've ever had the misfortune to watch. It's a lousy excuse for a cultural film, composed as it is of a seemingly endless montage of architecture, horse-drawn carriages and a couple waltzing in a park, presumably because it was cheaper than hiring a group of dancers and a ballroom.That is, in fact, the word which defines this production: Cheap. The sound quality is horrific. As soon as you adjust the sound so you can actually hear the music -- which isn't that well done to begin with -- the volume shoots up so high it's almost painful. The film itself could've been shot by any reasonably competent amateur with a video camera and a couple of friends who have formal attire and can dance a bit.There's nothing about this DVD that I can recommend."
3,Great Detail,"This is an Audio-Biography cd, not musical. at the beginning of each chapter there is an small clip of Aaliyah's interview. There is an English woman reading her Bio... The first chapter is actually funny when she she tries to talk American slang. The bio is in great detail of Aaliyah's life. you might find out somethings you don't know. The whole cd is 60 mins approx. I would only suggest you buy this Cd if your a huge fan of Aaliyah,like myself."
5,Best Choice Among Outsourcing Books on Market,"I have reviewed seven current books on Outsourcing and I recommend this book as the most comprehensive and best written for action. Direct, concise instructions for all levels of management and professional staff deliver where the rest of the books falter. The others border mostly between textbook and/or economic theory. The Black Book of Outsourcing delivers real answers and purposeful directions to success.Without reservation, this is the Only ""5 Star Book"" on outsourcing available."
5,Outsourcing Impacts Hospital & Healthcare Industries - Management Take Note of this Book,"The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations finds through the survey process, consistent errors in reporting and accountability because of improper outsourcing procedures by hospital administrators and managers.Although this book is written for the general business community, Brown was a former hospital administrator and understand the impact of outsourcing on healthcare operations thoroughly.If you're in healthcare, and outsourcing (97.5% of US hospitals outsource something, the largest industry group of all GNP types to outsource), then I highly recommend you purchase this book and investigate what you're missing, ignoring or under-estimating! Two thumbs up!"
2,Consultants' Sales Pitch,"This book was written by two outsourcing consultants. While it has some useful information, the sales pitch (hire a consultant, hire a consultant, hire a consultant) is too much. The authors should have hired an editor. I bought their book. I would not hire them as consultants."
1,Doesn't deliver,"This was a good premise: twins pregnant by the same unsuspecting man? However, the characters are annoying, frustrating and not worth the trouble. The one twin is a congenital liar, self-centered and immature. Her sister constantly forgives the unforgivable and feels ""protective"".Maybe in the hands of a better writer this plot would have been interesting and emotional, but as is its fluff without the fun."
5,Sweeping landscapes in a vista of sound,"I have to agree with Aris in accepting that this album transcends the normal, or what one may expect from the ambient. Sometimes, and often quite rarely, music can take one to the beyond, where something quite intangible reaches the subconscious.This CD required only a single playing to feel part of it. The mood could be described as sombre, or 'dark ambient', but the music flows into scintillating patterns of dark and light. The sounds are woven intricately into different perspectives of imagination, ending magnificently in a kind of dance one would find at any destined frontier."
2,Pure Flying,"This was nothing but pure flying. I wish that there would have been some comentary along with the footage. All it shows is planes in the air. No documentary or dialogue. Just some music that is ok but gets on your nerves after a while. Some of the footage was computer generated and not real. Most, however, was pure flying footage. If you do not know much about military aircraft it is difficut to tell when you are watching a different plane. For the price you can't beat it. But if you want to learn more about aviation, this company makes a three dvd set of documentaries about bombers, fighters and attack planes that is much better and the price is about the same. This was a better choice for me."
4,"If you dont like Red Dwarf, your a goit","Red Dwarf is a great comedy series that is a toss up between a sci fi comedy, or a comedy sci fi. For me, it's a comedy set in space, sci fi sounds to geeky to describe this hillarious and long running series.season 2 is even funnier then season 1. and has some hillarious, and all-time greatest comedy moments. if you cant enjoy Red Dwarf, you must be a smeg head.EGGS- Animated Commentary about Queeg -On the main menu of disc 1. Highlight `subtitles' and press down. You will highlight a yellow button on the control panel of the screen. Press enter and the menu will pan left to a screen with the `holly hop drive'. There are two options, ""stop"" & ""start"". Select the green one ""start"" and you will start the producer's visual commentary about the episode ""Queeg""!these seasons keep getting funnier then the last."
3,Mixed Bag of Flight Tales!,"Subtitled ""More Adventures in Military Aviation,"" this book is a sequel to the author's SECOND LUCKIEST PILOT published in 2000 by the Naval Institute Press. It recounts various combat missions and other flights made by the author and other Marine Corps and Navy pilots from the Korean War to the fighting on Afghanistan.To be honest, I can't rate this book higher than a ""3."" Some of the stories are interesting, some aren't. And, at $28.95, it's overpriced.An optional purchase."
2,"Why add the ""-us"" suffix to Illyrian names?","The ""-us, -is, -os"" suffixes are used by Greek for Greek names. Illyrians don't use the ""-*s"" suffix.Bardyllis is wrong. The original name is Bardhyl. Bardyllis has been deformed to fit the Greek grammar.Ballaios is wrong. The original name is Bala/Balla. Bala is a family name used by Albanians in Kosovo in Duka Gjini valley. Also the Bal is used to call the older brother in some Illyrian tribes where addressing the older brother directly by name was not polite. This is still used in by Kosovo Albanians."
5,Masterful job of telling the true story accurately,"As the Prosecutor in this case I wondered if anyone could really capture the essence of this horrific story. There were just so many different aspects to the case, the mystery surrounding Brian and David's disappearance, the years of wondering what had really happened to the point where the case became a Michigan legend, the dogged investigators who never gave up chasing down thousands of tips over eighteen years, the eventual electrifying discovery of an eye witness who had lived in fear for nearly two decades and the gut wretching trial which revealed the horrific truth about the murders of Brian Ogjan and David Tyll. It's all in the book. Tom Henderson did a masterful job of telling the real story and letting the reader get a true life feel for what really transpired in this horrendous murder case. I was astonished at how he caught the true essence of the case. A mezmerizing read that I couldn't put down. Fabulous job Tom! You got it right."
4,Excellent,"I have always heard the stories growing up in Alcona County, it was good to finally have everything put together."
3,A far cry from fluid...,"I took a special interest in this book because it happened near my hometown. A witness list 18 years long is daunting to digest, (rightfully so) but the book reads in a report like fashion as opposed to a story with plot development, bouncing back and forth from present to past tense. There were many hard hitting moments and language that captured your attention but unfortunately that was only at times. However, the end of the book, when detailing the court case, testimonies and attorneys was outstanding. I probably would not have sought out this book had I not had the personal connection to the location."
1,Tedious,"This book had a good story line. However that is where the positives end. Maybe if you lived close to where the hunters went missing or were involved in this case it may be enjoyable. Just dragged on for me, a bit like the investigation really. Was glad when I finally got through this book."
3,Darker than Night,"Ok book, you probably need to be from Michigan to remember all that went on in the media, but anyone may enjoy."
3,Good Story - amateur-like writing,"This is a very interesting story, especially for someone who lives near Monroe, MI (one area where the ""bad guys"" operated) and who hunts every year nearby the crime scene, including when this crime was committed.This book has some serious problems with the way it was written, however. It does not come across as being written by a professional writer. There appears to have been little or no editing of this book, and even includes geographic errors (like a town being indicated as being east of another when it is west), spelling errors, alternately calling the same indictments ""investigative"" and ""legislative"" etc.The editing errors were very distracting to an otherwise interesting and apparently well researched book. I can't imagine a publishing house allowing this out the door without having adequate editing, but this one made it to publication without a thorough review."
4,Great read,Once I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. It was a little slow moving at first. The writing made me feel like I was there. I was from this area and it amazes me that it could of been anyone that had an encountered these two brothers that night.
3,maze: the deception,"After putting each ""room"" on a card and placing them on a table, I have found that the answer isn't forthcoming nor is the response from he publisher or author (as of yet). I hav e a suspicion that this is a grand illusion and that is no fun!"
1,It's FREE online.,"If you are remotely interested in this product look for it online. After I bought this book I was disappointed the clues do not accurately take you throughout the MAZE. Therefore, I went looking online for the answers to the MAZE and found the product was available online for FREE."
4,Brilliant & beautifully presented concept,"This book is, as the preface states, not so much a book as a maze in the shape of a book,, consisting of a set of beautifully illustrated rooms which are full of possible clues, each picture being accompanied with a narrative. Numbered doors leading from each room present a choice as to which room you want to enter next.One problem, it is impossible to find the shortest way by any ""obvious"" means, in the sense that you can pass through a series of plainly numbered doors and reach the goal. That must be deduced from the various clues. Unfortunately the vagueness of the problem's parameters make one uncertain as to just what it is impossible to deduce. I haven't yet, but suspect that when I find the solution it will prove painfully obvious.Anyone out there who has found the answer, I'd appreciate a hint!"
3,Maze Book,"I only bought this book because I was curious about it when I saw it going for (up to) $150.00. I bought a used copy for $6. It is an interesting concept and a challenge to solve. One of the things that makes it difficult to solve is, there are no instructions other than (can you do it in as few of rooms as possible but then specifies 16 rooms). The first time I read it I solved it in about 5 rooms (I assume this was not correct being it states 16 on the so called directions page). I also assume you should not retrace any of your rooms, but the directions do not stipulate that. If you like puzzles then you will like this book. I do not feel it is worth more than the cover price of about $10."
2,Maze,I returned it because I just didn't get it.Maybe it is for some of the geek type kids.I didn't give it to my nephews because Icouldn't understand it : (
5,Hands-down the best maze I've ever been lost in,"I first stumbled upon this book at the age of twelve. I always enjoyed mazes and thought I'd be able to add another notch to my belt in no time at all, an hour at most. I spent every free minute for the next several months looking at this beautiful book, completely lost in its simplicity.Twelve years later, I found myself entering the maze again, just as bewildered. I finally, with a little help from my friends (who think this book is evil in its purest form,) was able to find the shortest path from 1 to 45 and back again. Now if I can only unravel the hidden riddle and trace the answer through those many rooms, I believe I may just die a happy man.As for the author/illustrator Christopher Manson, I tip my proverbial hat to you, sir. I believe you may have me in check, but I've a few tricks left up my sleeve as well.I both fear and covet the next offering of this caliber, though to equal MAZE would be an astonishing feat.This is my favorite book. Ever."
3,nice but ... no answers,"The format of this book is interesting: each numbered page is a room. The reader's goal is interesting: find the path from the first room to the 45th room and back. The text follows a person (the narrator) guiding a small group of visitors around the maze-building. The drawings are all pen & ink (no color). The task & setup are fun, but ...Here are my issues: (1) The narrator is a bit nasty -- nothing unsuitable for young children, but certainly not pleasant. (2) You absolutely MUST solve at least one riddle to find a path from room 1 to room 45. (3) There is no way to know whether you have found the correct answer to a riddle -- or for that matter, the shortest path.My daughter & I have enjoyed reading this book together. It was intersting & fun. You'll enjoy it more if you aren't expecting a 5-star book."
2,Why waste your time?,"If you are an expert puzzle solver, especially with words, maybe you could enjoy this. My kids and I looked through it for 20 minutes and didn't feel like we got anywhere. I looked up solutions online and thought, ""Seriously? Who has time to figure this out!?""Ridiculously difficult puzzle. The artwork was nice, so it doesn't deserve 1 start, but I'd much rather spend my time digging into a puzzle that more than a dozen people in the world can actually figure out."
2,just didn't quite get this book,this book just wasn't what I expected.... kind of hard to understand.... I lost interest after the first couple pages.
4,Captivating but frustrating.,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. The pictures are nice, the story is intriguing, but the puzzle is unsolvable. I finally looked up the answer on the web and read about it. There are clues there, and if you're the kind of person that looks for those kind of clues, then perhaps you will solve it. It's tricky but not impossible. I would have been completely frustrated without finding the answer on the web. Buy it, and take a shot."
1,"Misleading, irrelevant, and badly edited","Please do not buy this dictionary. I invested in this edition right before living in Paris and many times was tempted to go down the street to Larousse's offices and throw it through the window. Buying a comprehensive dictionary indicates a need for precise definitions and accurate idiomatic word choice, not archaicisms and generalities. On these counts this dictionary utterly failed. I would wholeheartedly recommend the HarperCollins Robert Senior and Super Senior dictionaries, which are much better, and comparable in price."
3,"the exile - douglas fairbanks, jr.","Please release a DVD format of this movie ""The Exile"" starring douglas fairbanks,jr. with english subtitle, and language in english..."
5,'Meet The Outcasts / The Mod Sound Of The Arkay IV' (Collectables),"Was amazed at just how much I dug this split CD by two lesser known 'garage rock' bands of many days gone by. First, you get twelve tracks by Long Island's own Outcasts - liked the catchy ""I'm Back In Line"", the toe-tapping ""You'd Be Surprised"", ""Today's The Day"", the hip ""Groovy Feeling"" and the beautifully played ""Rain, Roses, Candlelight And Wine"". Then there are fourteen cuts by the Arkay IV in which most do not appear on their sole CD release 'When We Was Younger... Than Yesterday' (see my review) - Arkay IV lures you in with the should-have-been a major hit ""Little Girl"", ""Girl, You've Got A Lot Of Things To Learn"" and ""Another Way"". Essential."
2,The Outcasts win by a nose,"This if I remember right was a battle of the bands album, and after hearing it I feel that Long Island's Outcasts won by a nose. I'm actually looking for the album ""Meet The Outcasts"" where it has 2 rather boss songs from 1965 when they were called ""The Radiators"" with ""Nothing But Love"", and ""Something About You"". The rest of this could sound like they were trying to imitate The Left Banke, or The Hassles take your pick. The Arkay 4 not one song was good. I probably wouldn't have liked it back in my late ***** early 20's neither. With 60's punk sometimes it's terrific others not so terrific. This is one of the not so's ."
1,"Love it, but Lost it.","My geriatric cats loved this and they needed the calories. The problem is I can no longer find it. I was forced to switch to another Royal Canin formula. Shame on Royal Canin, as they have pulled product before and they should know sudden food changes do not sit well with cats."
1,Looks cheap,I actually ordered the Global Decor 170 Drink Dispenser and was sent this flashing version by mistake. I immediately called to send it back. I think this would be fun for a bunch of frat boys but it looks too cheap for us to put on our bar.
2,rather unimpressed,"This thing feels like it's going to fall apart as soon as you take it out of the package. Every moving part is loose in it's track expecially the pour spouts, but all of this is to be expected with a 50 novelity pourer. I will say it is a hit at party's though."
2,"Disappointing, especially for an Atwood fan","Life Before Man was a big disappointment to me. I love all of Margaret Atwood's other books and have always enjoyed the skillful movements back and forth through stages in the charcters lives. Unfortunatly, this device doesn't work well in this book because so very little actually happens. It is character driven and introspective to a fault, especially since none of the characters are likeable. Those in sympathetic positions (Lesje and Nate) are too colorless to inspire affection or loyalty, and Elizabeth, while possessing of some spirit and initiative, is too selfish and cold to inspire sympathy. If you've decided to read Margaret Atwood, please start with Cat's Eye or Alias Grace or The Robber Bride. There may be something to be learned from Life Before Man, but it's too sad and slow a lesson."
3,"Creative, but hard to follow.","I thought that it was a good story, but because of the three different people talking I found it hard to follow. They each gave their view, which is often helpful, but not here. For the most part they all told different stories and were never really connceted."
2,"interesting and at the same time, quite repetitive","The story was interesting. Although I've never read any of her other books, I've heard that many of her novels are similar to this one. The story was pretty much everyone having an affair with someone. All the affairs seems to worsen the lives of everyone.She does seem to understand men and women quite well though."
2,Sluggish and disappointing,"As a true lover of Margaret Attwood's work, I must confess that I found this book to be a disappointment. To be sure it is well crafted and well written. However, the story line is uninteresting and repetitive."
4,Life Before Man,"I originally bought this book because of the description of Lesje's character-her obsession with dinosaurs. Throughout the book, she was my favorite of the three. Nate was nice but so soft that he could never argue with Elizabeth, who I hated because of her extremely manipulative tendencies. I thought it was interesting how she was depicted at the end, and I loved the last line of the book. Very depressing, and I didn't catch most of the symbolism the first time around, so I'll have to re-read it."
4,Very Cute-Serve their purpose,"These rings are very cute. I purchased these as play jewelry instead of cupcake accessories for my Elmo-loving daughter & she gets a kick out of wearing a whole handful. These are adjustable, so you could end up with a pinched finger by using them as jewelry but they are a fun, cute product."
5,"Good toy, the kids loved them.",I used them for cupcakes at a party. The kids loved them and they hold up really well. It was a good price and you got what you paid for.
4,Only 8 in a package!,"Somehow I assumed there were a dozen in one package but there are only 8. I didn't have time to order more before my daughter's birthday so make sure to order two packages if you need 12. Otherwise no complaints, I thought the rings are quite cute on top of cupcakes. The kids gave the elmo rings to their moms as presents after eating their cupcakes."
2,Better to use for cupcakes,"These rings are intended for use as decor for cupcakes and that would be where I would recommend use. Because at the age most kids are in love with Elmo, these rings are way too big for them to use as rings. They fall off and then they lose interest quickly. Would be cute as a decoration if attached to a present with some ribbon too. Seem to be too big to be a swallowing hazard, but I wouldn't chance it = always supervise toddler play with this item. As decor for cupcakes or gifts, I'd give it a high approval rating. As a toy, I'd say don't buy it."
4,"Not top of the line, but pretty.","Pros:It is a pretty and elegant candy dish and it is surprisingly heavy so it's not as likely to get knocked over. The bowl has a diameter of 6 inches and probably holds about 3 cups of candy, which certainly is more practical than the more expensive, but tiny crystal dishes.Cons:As another reviewer stated, the dish is made in China. It says as much on the box. The inside label claims it was made by Bohemian glass makers, which is doubtful unless they were exported to China. It is also machine-made, as the two-part mold seam is visible and the material does not have much of a sparkle. The cut edges are too rounded to produce a sparkle by themselves.My main concerns with a candy dish were for it to be pretty, sturdy, have a lid, hold a decent amount of candy, and not cost enough to make me cry if it gets broken due to constant usage by clumsy guests. If those are your priorities, this is the dish for you."
2,GLASS MADE IN CHINA,"It is not 24% lead crystal, no ""sparkle"". The glass has some bubbles. The piece is a machine-made. You can see and feel mold marks thin raised line on the glass which indicates that two halves of a mold met.The piece is made in China not in Czech. I will keep the piece and get rid of it this Christmas."
4,Good Advice- and a Good Book,"I loved reading this mystery. I've never learned about Leigh Koslow before, but I still fell right into this one. Good tale with a cat. I hope that you try this movie and enjoy the same settings and characters I did."
1,Terrible Quality,Bought this product last week. Terrible Quality. Very disappointed with this product. It does not fit my 2006 Corolla well. No more AVS brand for me. I'm going with WeatherTech.
4,Perfect,"Exactly what I wanted, expected and fit perfectly. Super easy to install! Adds style to my vehicle. Smart buy for me!"
3,Wrong DVD region but prompt corrective action,"Ordered the PAL DVD for use in Australia. Unfortunately was sent an NTSC 1 (USA) region DVD. Apparently incorrect details on the website. However, the response to this mistake has been very prompt and fair.Feedback is no PAL region DVD's are available."
4,House Music HiFi and Graphic video are excellent.,If you really like house music. Buy this now!! The Hifi- 2 channel stereo mix is superb with headphones. If you like the Bargrooves cds or Cafe Del Mar Chillhouse CDs you should like this. This is the true apartment dwellers escape to house music with video. Also check out Cream The DVD.Happy listening
5,"Beautifully written, beautiful photography, a gem","Written by a scientist, in the language of a poet, with the illustrations of a professional photographer - remarkably, all the same man. Highly recommended story, history, and life of the caribou and the environment within which it survives."
3,A useful book,"The Men-at-arms Series covers ancient and classical China in five books, all by Chris Peers who is very familiar with the subject. This is the first book of this series. The chapters: Chronology -- The Shang dynasty -- The Western Chou -- The Eastern Chou -- The 4th and 3rd centuries -- The Ch'in empire -- Tactical and strategic doctrine -- Ten decisive battles. The text is clearly written and informative, the drawings by Angus McBride are good, only the maps are a bit primitive and not very useful. The follow-up to this book is ""Imperial Chinese Armies 200BC - 589AD"" (MAA 284)."
2,Bizarre reconstructions,The text by Chris Peers is OK. The bland artwork by McBride is pretty bizarre. The white tentlike hats reconstructed from pictorial representations of the Han period are wrong. They serve no practical function and only add to a woeful catalog of misinterpretations of Oriental representations by Occidental artists.
5,Good book,"First of all, the plates are anything but 'bland' but are in fact very exciting. Honestly, I am no expert on ancient Chinese warfare and thus cannot say how accurate they are. Regardless of the plates, the text is extremely useful providing an excellent intro to the subject; exactly what I was seeking when I purchased this book. It covers the ancient and mysterious Shang Dynasty, the Chou Dynasties, and the warring states that were finally united in the 3rd Century BC."
1,An abomination of a book,"This is an awful, ghastly book, full of hate and anger. One can certainly understand why the author, a German Jew, would be so quick to see anti-Semitism in Erasmus' works. However, this topic was addressed with far more erudition and intellectual integrity by Shimon Markish, another Jewish scholar, in the book Erasmus and the Jews.The book is filled with angry rhetoric and verbal excesses. He calls the German people of the time ""semi-illiterate"". He manages to apply just about every invective he can to his victim: cowardly, brutal, stupid, vicious, hypocritical, hate-filled, shameless, and on and on. It really is an embarrasmment to read.Avoid this book! Read instead Erasmus and the Jews by Shimon Markish."
4,Surprisingly good...,"Ignore the off-putting title and cover--this is an interesting and enjoyable little book. Dunleavy Mallorough lives on a planet where inexplicable forces cause sudden catastrophes, unless individuals known as Sources control the forces so that they disperse harmlessly. To avoid dying in the process, Sources are protected by Shields, who place protective boundaries around the Sources while they work. Dunleavy is a Shield who finds herself energetically bonded with Taro Karish, one of the most handsome, powerful, and charismatic Sources on the planet. However, Dunleavy had hopes of bonding with a quieter, more moderate Source. While the duo are learning to work together, they become involved in a plot to revolutionize how Sources and Shields are managed by the Empress and the Triple S, which trains and assigns Sources and Shields. This book is a nice little meal, not spectacular but definitely enjoyable. The sequel, The Hero Strikes Back, is due out in September 2006."
1,Nordine Bores For The Very First Time,Not among Ken's best efforts. Visual not a match for the audio. Boring!
4,Real kickboxing,"1) Read the previous review 2) I have the complete series of 3 videos. This is the introduction to Kickboxing and is essential for proper form. The second one is a serious *kickboxing* (not ""Tae-Bo""/cardio-kick aerobics) workout. The final has great (excrutiating, but thorough) floor workout and cool-down.I have had the pleasure of being one of Fairlie's students and her classes are great and never boring. She makes you work - HARD! The results are quick, after 2 months I lost 10 pounds!The workouts are also addictive...hence my purchase. Now I can do this great workout whenever & where-ever I want.The intro is a little slow, but if you venture forth to the second installment you will be greatful for the knowledgable instruction as proper form is essential.Enjoy!"
3,Season II much better; skip this one,"Corny punchlines, stupid jokes, cheap sets, and large and not infrequent plot holes kinda ruined this for me. Forget season I; you won't miss it. I highly recomend the second season and, well, everything past that. It gets way better later on, despite the replacement of Norman Lovett : ( . And I mean _WAY_ better. Buy them now."
1,Awful,"This movie was recommended by my 25 year old son who is usually very reliable. It is awful, not funny, and confusing. Maybe's its an age thing. I would not recommend it to anyone over 30!"
1,Agreeing with Minority,"Just one word - horrible. I just do not understand what is funny about this show and how it is popular. It's a mess. Poorly staged, bad lighting, annoying characters, insipid and I could not wait for it to be over. I bought Series I for my husband and me based on everyone's comments here and were we dissapointed. Do you want well done, well scripted and entertaining sci-fi? FIREFLY is the best I've seen. We love that show."
2,Expectations were too big.,I love British comedys but after my friends built this up in my mind I was fairly disappointed. The first 6 episodes are like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch gone on too long. The 'Cat' is not funny at all. I'm being told to stay with it as it gets really good but I don't know if I want to spend any more money on this stuff.
1,No cooling here,"I bought this item because the manufacturer claimed it would keep a laptop cool. I was also looking for a more comfortable Notebook stand. If you are seeking comfort ONLY this might be for you although it is quite high and hard to see over the top of the laptop if you are in a reclining position. Although it does keep the heat from your lap it certainly did not keep my 17"" laptop cool at all. My laptop actually gets so hot (top, bottom, and side) I can feel the heat radiating from my laptop. On the positive side it is more comfortable than the Targus Notebook Portable LapDesk PA243U I was using before buying the cushtop but I am going back to the Targus."
3,Not as advertised,This is not a stand. It is way to high for me and my laptop. It is not comfortable to use. To much trouble to send it back so have my phone on it. Wasted my time and money on this one.
5,"not high-tech, but gets the job done","This thing is fantastic. Not very high-tech -- no cooling fan or anything to plug in -- but it gets the job done, and hey, that's all I really care about. It looks pretty sharp, too.I bought this based on some of the great reviews here, but when it arrived at my doorstep, I was kind of skeptical. The wedge shape of the stand feels awkward and a little severe the first time you use it, as if it's positioning the screen too high. After a few hours with it, however, I found it was at exactly the right height, and that what had felt ""normal"" to me before, without a stand, was not really all that comfortable.I've also been surprised that the stand keeps my laptop in a secure position. You'd think that the angle of the stand would make the laptop more likely to slip forward into your lap, but it doesn't. I'm not sure what the fabric consists of, but it feels well-made and sturdy.Give this thing a try. The only big choice you have is what color combo to get!"
5,A Gem From Chicago,"Jim Baker is an excellent pianist and an amazing synth player who plays almost nightly in the windy city. This is, from what I know at least, his first proper solo album and it's a doozy. His pianism takes wonderfully melodic and kotty lines and puts them through the prism of european art music, never loosing sight of his original melodic invention. His synth playing is the deal. I think he is truly one of the two greatest players (along with Thomas Lehn) of the synth right now. He gets some amazing sounds and textures out of his ARP, but more importantly puts them in the context of a real composition. Hopefully Delmark will put out some more material, and if you are in Chicago you can catch this unheralded act nightly for, I hate to say, peanuts."
3,Nice looking manifold but not that great.,"I like it because it is nice looking. The valve in the top controls the flow to all four ports, which may be useful on smaller lines. The little caps screw on, so they are both easily removed and hold the pressure when in place. BUT, the 1/4 tubing does NOT stay up, like socks that fall around your ankles. I will have to put the clamps on each hose, which adds that much more time to the installation. The green elbows turn easily, so pressing the 1/4 tubing onto them in the first place is difficult."
5,Outstanding value,"..., this 692 page hardcover book is an outstanding value. Edited by one of America's foremost critics, Andrew Sarris, with contributions by renowned scholars such as Dudley Andrew, David Bordwell, and Douglas Gomery, the content is excellent. Less opinionated and more informative than similar works, it's the best reference work on directors I've seen. With over 200 entries, all major directors are included. I highly recommend it."
1,A major disappointment.,"200 is far too few directors, and the selection is weighed towards current film-festival favorites.The write-ups on each director are by a grab bag of critics and scholars. The occasional gem (i.e. Robin Wood on Anthony Mann) is found among gushing fan notes and dull career overviews. There is little critical perspective such as in the editor's 1968 THE AMERICAN CINEMA.For the same money one could purchase David Thomson's A BIOGRAPHICAL DICTIONARY OF FILM. In that great work are perceptive critical appraisals of several hundred directors with complete filmographies, with the added bonus of stars, writers, cameramen, etc."
4,Durability at it's finest,"If these picks we're $20 for a pack of six,then they would still be worth it for their toughness alone. Tremolo picking,pick slides...these picks can take whatever your playing style throw's at them. I've had occasional issues with losing my grip on them when sweating,but otherwise as long as you don't lose them,you'll have an excellent set of picks that will last a LONG time."
1,Displeased.,"This recorder has never worked. The cassett door does not always open. and it has a buzz when I can get a tape in and something recorded, then played back. Tried to get a return once and never received an answer"
5,Disneylayne,THESE ARE THE GREATEST SHOES. I STAND ON MY FEET TO TEACH. THEY GO WITH EVERYTHING AND SO COMFORTABLE. I NOW HAVE THREE PAIRS.
5,"Betrayals (Babylon 5, Book 6)",I never new there had been any books written on Babylon 5 till I hear them talk about it on the dvds.
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Pot, kettle, black.The Centauri and the Narn hate each other, the whole birds andlizards thing. The Centauri oppress the Narn, so the Narn learn a fewtricks.The Narn uses this knowledge to oppress and exploit other races. This all ends up being no good for anyone."
5,Well made and constructed case-great protection,Lowepro makes an excellent camera case. This one is no exception.We purchased it for a Canon 590IS and it fits the camera perfectly. It offers a small section for an extra pair of batteries and SDHC card. It secures the camera very well and protects it. It is a very sleek and not bulky case which my wife likes for allowing it to go in her purse.
1,Wrong suggested case for product,"I bought this as the suggested case for the Leica d lux 4. It is too small. Not that the camera doesn't fit, its just a pain to do so. Put an extra battery and card in the flap and it is about worthless. Though quality and feel are great, it is the wrong sugggestion for the camera. When are casemakers for cameras going to think about how they might put an accessory pouch on the side."
4,Woulda been a 5 if it was US made...,"...but it's an excellent knife, very handy and useful, well-made, beautiful. The sheath seems sturdily built and is easy to attach to a variety of belts."
4,Highly recommended!,The underlying principles on the formation of the patterns were well discussed. Simple to understand due to actual samples.
3,Charting techniques for currency traders,"I never really read much of this book. When I bought it, I was trading foreign currency, but I gave that up shortly after my purchase."
4,Beyond Candlesticks,"The book is written in a clear, easy to follow style. The concepts, although not complex, have their nuances and these are dealt with in a way that doesn't confuse or overwhelm the reader. The exercises provided help to consolidate the knowledge gained by the reader. All in all, a very good and useful book."
2,Very Unhappy,"I researched extensively before purchasing this track light. I wanted bronze which was extremely difficult to find at a reasonable price. 1 of the bulbs didn't work. These are fairly expensive bulbs, so that was a huge disappointment. However, that paled in comparison to the disappointment in the glass globes. After removing the sticker from the globes and rinsing the adhesive from them all the color washed off the globes. They are just painted and it all rinsed away. I am left with 3 frosted white globes. A huge disappointment. Do not buy!!"
1,Won't Program,"I have the same problem as the two reviewers who state it will not program at all. Exact same result for me. And, yes, I checked the battery. It was fresh. It's a shame because it looks like it would work great if it did. Quality control must be a real problem with this product as it seems to be the luck of the draw if you get a good unit or not. I wanted to give it to my MIL who just needs something simple so the cable box and TV settings don't get all messed up. Oh well.... nice try."
1,Does not work...,"Well I have tried programming this remote on multiple TVs, and nothing happened. The instructions say that the ""TV"" light will stay on after holding it down for a few seconds and that is not the case for mine. A complete waste of money."
2,3 ton jack,The jack came without oil. Had to purchase oil and fill the jack. I should have check around. There were better prices for the same jack at various locations for a cheaper price. Not very impressed with the product the the quality check.
5,No problems for almost two years now,"Great item, would buy another one soon. Jack is being use to lift mostly Toyota trucks, which are not to heavy."
5,A Must,"Entertaining, intellectually stimulating, a classic. Anyone who is intersted in philosophy must read this book. From the natural ethic to the ideal state, this book has it all. It is the counter-ideal to Nietzsche's Zarathustra (also a five-star must-read). This should be issued to every child at birth."
2,Alsome,"It was like new, no markings, no high lights, and no rips or tares to pages it was a good textbook"
1,I'm going to throw it away and it's brand new:(,The GMA Grube translation revised by CVC Reeve is the one most recommended for students. This is Benjamin Jowett's version. Worst of all many pages simply pealed out of the book. I'd take your chance the the GMA Grube version that has the same reviews as this one but half the price.
1,Not a favorite,My son loves teh Icky Sticky Frog so I bought this one - the story isn't very good (too complicated). He gets another book after the first page. Not worth the money
3,Meh,"Unlike his first 2 albums, I didn't so much enjoy this CD, yea I know its a soundtrack etc. But Brushfire Fairytales, and On and On completely blew me away, he was the greatest. So inevitably I go out and buy everything else that's his. His surf videos are amazing, but I don't think this soundtrack is SO great. I mean its fun to listen to once or twice, but I can't see myself popping this into the cd player more than once a week. He's still a great singer/songwriter and will always have his place in the cd player."
5,Beautiful surf film,"This is a film, not a movie. Very little talking, just action. Jack has a way with the camera...his shots are well done. Some lean towards being artsy but they're easy on the eyes and not too overdone. The music is perfect, a nice change from normal surf movie tunes. :) You can turn off your brain and watch this one, it's like you're there with them at times.Well done, Jack and co!(Oh, get the soundtrack, it's great)"
4,Artsy surf film,"Yes it is a little short, but they shred the whole time. Tough to know where they are, would like to know. Kinda arrogant, like them sharing their memories is something really special, I guess it tries to be a little too artsy. I'm not dogging it, it's certainly different than most surf films, it's just whether you like that kind of thing. And the music in the background seems somewhat repetitive, the same baseline over and over. But like I said, they rip it the whole time, so it's tough to be mad."
3,Not really Jack Johnson solo,"I bought this disc in the hope that it would feature more of Jack Johnson's solo work. I was disappointed. The music is ok, but it is many different artists. It IS a soundtrack however, so I should not have been surprised. The music is not bad and is generally in keeping with the tone of most of Mr. Johnson's style. If you want more Jack Johnson, though, stick with his other discs."
4,Thicker than water soundtrack,"Great cd...especially Rainbow by G Love and Jack Johnson. Truly amazing...gotta love G love. Anyone see them on Letterman, Kimmel or that Carson Daly show??? Amazing"
2,"Good soundtrack, less than exciting footage","I just bought this DVD and am very disappointed. Yes, the soundtrack is good, however the footage is very boring. Some sections of the movie (like the surf session with the old ""singlefin green"") are nice for the soul content, but the rest is very, very substandard surfing (nothing really amazing on the wave size or on the ""gnarliness"" of the moves). I haven't watched the bonus video yet, but I don't think it'll be that good to change my rating. If you're looking for soul content, you're much better off buying ""Singlefin Yellow"". If you want to buy this for the soundtrack, then buy the CD."
3,Whats here is awesome,"dont be fooled by the three stars, this CD has some great music on it. my only trouble with this SOUNDTRACK is that they left about a third of the sountrack off! i was very happy when i first got the soundtrack, but then i got the movie two weeks later and i realized how much was kmissing i was very dissappointed. read the other reviews for an analysis of the music on it (which in my opinion is great), but if your looking for a complete soundtrack, it isnt here."
3,"Now I love The Voyces, too","The Voyces' song, RELATE TO ME, is easily the standout. (I tracked them down as a result of this soundtrack and bought their whole record, which I would highly recommend.) I dig Jack Johnson, so I like those songs, as well. The bottom line is this: it's worth it alone to discover this wonderful group called The Voyces. But if you like Jack's music, you should buy this CD anyway."
2,Eye Candy,"The footage in this flick is great. The music sucks. It's mostly bluesy un-plugged funk and slide guitar rambling and wanking throughout. The actual surfing is much more aggressive than the music in the background. It's more of an annoying distraction than anything else. People who bought the soundtrack to this flick also bought CD's by Norah Jones, so that probably explains it. It's like the whole thing is in slow motion. What a drag. Turn off the sound and play your own music."
4,Good driving music,This is an excellent CD to listen to while driving up and down the California coast. Jack Johnson seems to be getting better and better. And The Voyces have a very interesting sound. G. Love delivers as always.
5,Love It!,"I bought this CD about 3 months ago in a little music shop in the city, because of the surfing influence. Today in the car I put it in the CD player for the third time in a row. I really enjoy the different types of music, it dosn't get old like most ""various artists"" CD's I own. I have especially taken a liking to Jack Johnson, lovely guitar."
3,I wish I just downloaded mp3 version,"I got the CD, moved all the songs to my mp3 players but deleted all the songs but Jack Johnson's. First I thought those other songs were cool, but I got tired of listening to them. I cannot stand them. I should have known it was a soundtrack before I purchase it.Since there is no mp3 songs download available for this CD, you all have to buy the whole thing to see if you like the songs or not. Good luck."
4,Redefining Surf Music - Jack & Friends,"Jack takes beach music beyond the Beach Boys and Dick Dale and redefines the laid back sound of the surf. Jack contributes to a few track both solo efforts and with G. Love - the great, but simple Rainbow Blues. This album is great and gets better with repeat listings. Buy and enjoy."
5,Road Trippin,"I didn't hear of Jack Johnson until I heard On and On at a bar one night and I was floored. After I bought On and On I went out and bought Thicker Than Water and was equally impressed. At first I was thrown off by all these different artists, most of which I never heard of, but after hearing it I was sold. I recently made a trip from Tampa to Boston and back and I listened to this record and On and On for a lot of the trip. The songs are so smooth and put you in a good place."
3,Not as good as I expected!,"The first music video Jack Johnson was much better! However, if your a Jacki fan then it's a great addition to your collection."
4,therapy for mid-winter doldrums in frigid northeast,"Received the CD for Christmas and on first listen thought it was kind of interesting in spots. Then played it again, and again, and again, and again. It's one of the few CDs I can let go round and round three or four times and feel a different response each time. It's great work music. It's great space out and daydream music. I'm eager to see the DVD and hear the other stuff not included in the audio version."
5,GREAT FILM,Very well done! Great shots and a killer soundtrack. Get the film for your house and the CD for your car.
1,Telesteps 12s,I purchased this ladder thru Amazon. I Had it for 2 weeks and the ladder would not fold down completely. I contact Telestep to informed them of the problem and they would not replace or care about the problem because it was not purchase thru them. They don't stand behind their product and doesn't really care if there is an issue with it. You will not get an service from them if you buy this product.
5,movie fan,"Great movie about The Street Gang. The Cobras, a vicious street gang, rule an embattled high school with their violent brand of terror. But they're headed for a showdown when an ex-gang-member-gone-good challenges their brutal reign. You will enjoy this movie."
3,Good performances outshine a drab production design,"In the role that launched an acclaimed career typified by roles of troubled women, Leigh ably portrays a teenage girl suffering from an extreme obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa and numerous critical health problems resulting from the latter. Based on the novel by Steven Levenkron, this television production was clearly released (by Aaron Spelling) at an ideal time to capitalize on a minor health and mental epidemic among young women in affluent suburbia. But despite the dated production values and hokey melodrama of the script, this material is elevated by a solid story and the excellent performances of a cast consisting of celebrated veterans and future stars. TV movies hadn't yet fully developed a stigma of low quality, so Spelling was still able to cherry-pick from a selection of fine actors. This is recommended viewing on a double bill with The Boy in the Plastic Bubble or Brian's Song."
2,From Russia with Tedium,"It is the year 2015, and a post-civil war Russia attempts to build a new democracy and discard centuries of Totalitarianism. Constantin Vadim, a militiaman from Murmansk, is assigned to Moscow as the chief homicide inspector of a destitute and war-torn district of Moscow to take charge of a brutal string of murders of young women by a fiend dubbed the ""monstrum"". For sure, an unusual and ambitious setting for a serial murder mystery, which historian Donald James tackles in ""Monstrum"". It is this ambition, however, that fatally flaws what could have been an intriguing novel; there are simply too many plots set in motion and too many messages that James is trying to deliver. Told by Vadim in first person, the all-too-frequent addresses to the reader as ""my brothers"" becomes tedious. While in the end most of these threads come together, payoff feels contrived, wholly implausible, and ultimately disappointing."
3,Not MCS,"When will I learn, whenever I pick up a book that says it is the next XX - I should remember this book. Gorky Park was a fabulous book and this book did not live up to it. Don't get me wrong, I liked this book and it did have same similarities to Gorky Park (almost too many). I liked the descriptions of how Russia had fallen in the book into a complete state of everyone out for themselves ruthlessness. The serial killer bit was ok, not a copy of anything else we know but the author did not really sell it to you. I also thought the political side story / cause was a little distracting becuase it was too pushy - you knew it would have a part to play at the end. Overall I think this is an average book."
1,Buyers beware! - Poor craftsmanship,"Although this hair stick pin looks beautiful in the photo, it turned out to be a major disappointment. The one I received had some type of hole carved out of the wood, and the silver celtic knot was sloppily glued into place with some type of black ""gunk."" It looks absolutely terrible, and I'm going to return it for an exchange. I'd give this item a rating of zero out of five stars, but a rating of one star was the lowest option I could choose.The other items I received from this company were of excellent quality, however, so I will definitely order from them in the future. I guess you can't win them all!"
2,:(,"Looks pretty, but horribly made. The wood is barely sanded and it is not varnished, so it grabs and pulls my hair. Huge disappointment."
5,Wow.,"This is a terrific but sad story about a deaf-mute who works as a professional engraver, and moves to a small town to be of assistance to his only friend, another deaf-mute who also has mental retardation. The former is intelligent and significantly helpful to those around him, but remains more or less ignored as he is silent. There are numerous sub-plots, and the actors, who include Sondra Locke and Cicily Tyson, are excellent. This is drama at its best."
4,video,"I like the movie and the video is in good shape. I feel I paid too much for a used video, considering that vcr's are getting very hard to find and will soon be phased out like 8 tracks. I wanted the dvd that was offered but the price was exorbitant."
2,Like the book? - Don't buy the movie,"Any fan of the heart-wrenching Carson McCullers book that spawned this movie will kick themselves for buying this flick. The themes in the book are subtle in their intensity, like an ocean sunset. The movie takes these themes and defiles them - they are ... to the point of ""after-school special"" simplicity. The characters have no depth, no evolution.Arkin turns in a great performance, rising above the poor screen adaptation of a beautiful novel."
3,the liberal bleeding heart 60's movie,"We have a deaf mute, black doctor and a poor white girl.in a story that tears at the heart and leaves a blackguys leg in a prison hospital.I wish they would have had closed captioning for the sign languageas I felt I missed a lot of the meaning by not understanding it.I liked the movie, but thought that it kind of tried hard to push all your buttonswithout giving you a chance to think about the situations."
5,Read hearts not lips (recommended),"Try as he may, stranger John Singer (Alan Arkin) just can't fit in. Responding to a vacancy ad, he becomes a single-room boarder in the home of a financially challenged family. Despite his handicap, he is one of the most helpful and caring persons in this southern town he tries to call home. If others could only read hearts as well as he reads lips, his internal vacancy could be very easily filled. Nevertheless, his loneliness -- transparent to onlookers -- grows with unspoken words until it eventually becomes unbearable.It is hard to believe that Arkin can deliver such a dramatic role without uttering a word. This is a testimony to true versatility as you compare him inWAIT UNTIL DARK. Obviously Arkin must be accompanied by a great supportive cast. And he is with Cicely Tyson delivering a powerful performance."
1,It's time to stop reprinting this old translation,"Sheridan made a brave attempt some 25 years ago to render Lacan's difficult prose into English, but Sheridan's command of French left a great deal to be desired, and his knowledge of Lacan's numerous seminars (that form the backdrop of most of his writings) was non-existent; after all, almost none of them were available even in French at that time. This old translation should no longer be reprinted: it is virtually incomprehensible at times and is often quite inaccurate. Readers seeking to study the Ecrits should consult the 2002 translation by myself; the paperback version will be out very shortly, will be competitive in price with this old translation, and is vastly superior in readability and accurary."
2,"Close, but no cigar.","It seems my copy was printed by an Indian distributor and many many attempts were made on the cover and inside cover to hide that fact. There also were a few typos on the summary of the back cover. I'm sure the contents of the book are in order, but this was a little weird/disappointing to find."
1,Pretentious Nonsense!,"Only for the terminally hip and the fashionably confused. Lacan, the guru of so-called philosophers and other purveyors of phenomenological psycho-babble, takes Freud's ""theories"" to their reductio ad absurdum."
4,Learning about wine CAN be fun and non-intimidating!,"Don't let the lighthearted, chatty tone of the book fool you -- this book has real, solid information. Yes, it talks about varietals, fermentation, and has some technical wine info, but it also talks about integrating wine into your lifestyle, something that many books overlook. It's written for regular people, not just for people with fat bank accounts. Wine and popcorn, pizza, Chinese take-out -- why not? It's delicious!I loved the *practical* suggestions on how to start a wine collection -- e.g. skip buying a few lattes each week and buy a bottle of wine instead. The winemaker's diary was also a treat to read -- it made me appreciate wine a whole lot more.The only tiny problem I had with the book -- no index! Oh well, the fresh, fun and informative content in this book more than makes up for it."
2,Not as I expected.,This DVD doesn't have much of Piranha scenes as I expected. The scene they keep repeating again and again looks as though it was shot in an aquarium. but the info is rather good.
3,piranha's in the wild,"basically this movie is a one hour documentary that looks like one of those shows you would see on the discovery channel or maybe in high school biology class. its not bad, but its not great. nothing suprised me in it. its scenes of the jungle while a narrator says something every few moments or so. if you think this video is something out of a horror film where the piranhas kill everything in sight then you will be disappointed. they only eat a catfish alive, everything else is already dead. if you own piranhas,like me, and can appreciate them, then buy this video. but if your just a regular person and want to see piranhas kill things then i wouldn't. the finish it up, this slow pace film is average and i think the producers got most of the footage by recording clips off the learning channel or maybe even animal planet with the crocodile hunter."
5,Topeak JoeBlow Sprint Floor Bike Pump,"This is the best bike pump I've ever used. Each stroke pumps a great deal of air with very little effort, and the pressure guage is accurate."
4,Good product,"The pump dial is easy to read and the limit indicator is a nice touch. It clamps very well to my bike stem even if I don't get it on all the way. Best of all, it takes fewer pumps to get to the right setting than any of my other pumps."
1,Didn't work,Couldn't return because the pkging was a little torn. Money I could not afford to waste. Oh we'll learned my lesson
2,Topeak Joe Blow Pro pump,I bought this pump and it worked wonderfully for about 3 1/2 years and developed a leak I could not find. I don't think I would buy a Topeak pump again.
2,works well - sometimes,"Bought this at a bike store 2 weeks ago - have filled a football, tires on my mountain bike, and wife's road bike. Football was fine, no problems. For the bikes, very difficult to get it sealed on the valve and locked properly, as the large double head is extremely cumbersome.Had a 15 year old foot pump that worked great until the hose got one too many leaks in it, and thought I would upgrade. Had to take a small hand pump to get some pressure in my wife's tire before I could even get the head to seal on the valve. Overall for the price I would not recommend"
1,Good while it lasted,"The pump worked well enough while it lasted. But after two years it developed a major leak somewhere. Never could find it, and now it's worthless. I won't buy another Topeak pump."
5,WW2 on your computer screen,"This game is FUN!! If you plan to buy Commandos 2, you should play these games first. They are both good with a lot of realism and a very high level of difficulty. With a few shots, all of your men are dead, just to give an example of this difficulty and realism.The tutorials on each caracter show you the specs of each man. If you've never played the demo, you should use these.The game isn't too expensive and together you have more than 30 misssions to spend hours of fun on, so I would say: BUY IT!!"
5,Commandos Ammo Pack,"This game has been a memorial game to me for a long long time! When i first came to the U.S, i was home-sick badly, and bought a computer, started with this first game in 2001. Many hard missions kept me busy not home-sick, kept me busy. I love war games and was pushed to love WW2's history. Well, i lent a good boy this game so it lost. After playing so many war games included commandos 2 & 3, i was recalled about this first commandos game, so searched & bought it on line. The game had a great price, came on time, was installed easily, and is giving fun! Thank you very much Bargain Buyers Software! God bless your business!"
4,I agree with the previous poster about losing things,I bought these earbuds because I didn't like the ones that came with my Ipod. These are great - once you find the right fit with the rubber earbuds. It took me some time to figure out what set (or combo of sets) I liked best. The sound is great - I listen to a variety of music and have never been disappointed. My only problem has been that I lost one of the rubber covers for the size that I like the best.
4,An unknown gem,"I read this book with my child for a class assignment. We enjoyed it very much. It had interesting characters, a lot of forward movement with the plot, and taught a lesson on compassion. It was a good book to make children aware of the horrors of slavery without being too heavy-handed. I have read a LOT of children's chapter books that are much more highly rated and have won awards but that are not nearly as good as this book."
2,CRAPPY CRAP CRAP,"I have had it with lip plumpers! Many hours of research and money wasted on products that DO NOTHING! Not to mention that this lip plumper is SMALLER than my pinky. Looks good as a lip gloss and tastes good, but i can get a good gloss for [...]. Whatta rip off! Give me my money back!"
2,Not exactly a book,This is almost like a small pamphlet written at about a 2nd or 3rd grade level. It's OK -- had to look elsewhere for more substantial information.
4,"Wondeful movie, somewhat a sleeper","Viewed the last 15 minutes of this file on IFC one night and my wife and I found ourselves wanting to see the entire movie.We were not disappointed. Robin Williams was great and it is always nice to see him not being zany once in while. David Duchovny did a good job as well. Great story, well portrayed."
4,Pleasant,"I enjoyed this movie, it had a good feeling to it, and it was put together very nicely. Robin Williams was great as usual, and I also enjoyed Tea Leoni as the mother. The movie is about two people's relationship, one of them is a thirteen year old kid and the other guy is in his fourty's. The person in his fourty's is retarted. The movie is set right in New York City. The child must watch his mother slowly fall apart, and the relationship with the two of them is wonderful. Overall, this was a well done movie and I was suprised to see it didn't make it to the theaters."
5,Perhaps it was the suicide...,"That my own mother committed... Who knows? But that, among other things, touched me deeply. I strongly recommend this movie."
5,A must for book lovers,"This is an impeccably researched and footnoted book that packs in a ton of information about the major writers (i.e. all of them) who spent time in Rome and wrote about the experience. There's a quote on just about every page from someone famous, from Keats and Dickens and Zola to Florence Nightingale and Bernard Malamud. The author must have spent several years and exhausted any number of chairs researching this book. Once you read this book you will have to track down at least 25 more esoteric tomes following threads that pique your interest. I have not yet tried any of the walks, but just reading this amazing book is enough."
1,Do not waste your money,"This is aboslutely one of the worst books I have ever read. The writing is horrible, the stories are dull, the book is predictable, and it doesn't even give any advice on how to cope with being in your twenties. I'm sorry I bought it. So incidently, if you still want to read this book, mine is now on sale with the rest of the used books..."
1,It's like eating plastic,"Tastes waxy and fake - and that's because it's got partially hydrogenated oil. Unfortunately, this stuff is in just about everything and it's so dangerous! It'd be great if these companies with widely used chocolate products would limit their ingredients to stuff that your body can process!"
4,"'Chuka', A fine western","'Chuka' is a much under-rated western starring the equally under-rated Australian actor Rod Taylor. It has strong characterizations from its star, James Whitmore playing an army scout, Ernest Borgnine as a tough sergeant, and John Mills as the martinet colonel in command of a fort full of misfits. Taylor is the bitter gunfighter, fast with a gun, but displaying softer, gentler glimpses of his real self as he confronts a desperate situation that is none of his doing. Taylor carries the picture on his broad shoulders, even providing a few lighter moments in his usual laconic style. As westerns go, this is one that has slipped under the guard of most afficionados of the genre."
4,Very entertaining B movie,"This movie will take you back to the 70's, when one would go to action double features in second run movie theaters such as the Ambassador in San Juan. It's basically the standard Roger Corman ""women in prison"" formula but set in Roman times. But it's still a lot of fun. Pam Grier is, as usual, amazing. And she has two really good nude scenes which should really please fans. The action sequences are pretty good for this kind of movie. It would have been great to have some commentary by Pam Grier, but, all in all, it's a great movie to sit back, grab some popcorn, have a couple of beers and have a great time."
2,Classic Grier,"I would only recommend this filmbecause it is an interesting alternativeto the usual scenery in which we areaccustomed to seeing Pam Grier.Otherwise, it's stock 70's female exploitation,in which Pam Grier led the pack. Very little plot:exotic women are kidnapped from foreign locales andare trained in the arena, where they put on spectaclesfor eager, bloodthirsty onlookers. In the end, the fittestof the fittest, Grier and Markov, are forced to fight eachother. Fight or die, one or both. In the end, they bothrebel and race for freedom while pursued by the emperor'ssoldiers.Not much else to it.Even nudity isn't a plus here.It was not until this filmthat I noticed how extremely BEAUTIFULMargret Markov is. Whatever happened to her?I think this film is worth the time, but I don'tthink you'd want to buy it, unless you already have aspace on your DVD rack for once-viewed movies that will never again see daylight.This would be one of those movies."
1,Pure Awful!,"Yeah I know that this was a ""B"" movie but this was a chore to watch! I purchased it hoping like every other male to get to see some great nude scenes of Pam Grier and the few nude scenes (only 2 of Pam) are not even worth it. The picture guality for a DVD left much to be desired. There was no plot whatsoever but then again this is a Corman picture. Dolemite movies don't have a plot either but I'd much rather sit through one of his ridiculous attempts at cinema than this stinker. Like Pam Grier? Get Coffy and don't waste your money on this garbage!"
3,The Arena (aka Naked Warriers),I received the used DVD in a timely manner and it wasin perfect condition. The movie was okay but naturallynot as good as the promotion for the movie. I am gladthat I made the purchase.
3,Piggy Romans Vs. Gorgeous Women,"mild nudity, average xploitation for this ultimately boring flick in which miss pam grier shines over the top as usual# only reccomended if you're a die hard fan of miss grier or italian pervy miss rosalba neri here under her americanized name sara bay-shut up or i'll get you whipped## markov's character speech about freedom STINKS-for the men to fight and die is natural but the women...?!!! not only her speech is awfully jawdropping but when escaping the arena she leaves with no help the girl being ravaged by group of piggy romans, now that's what i call mercy!!! joe DANTE is the credited EDITOR"
3,Pleasant,"I began listening to the music of Kirk Whalum while I was a student and he was a young musician in Austin, TX. Since then, my tastes have grown away from fusion and toward traditional jazz. However, as a collector of gospel music played by non-gospel music artists, I happily purchased Kirk Whalum's The Gospel According to Jazz. I've listened to the CD 6 or 7 times now. I find the cuts to be pleasant but generally uninspiring. While listening to the CD, I never felt the urge to scream ""hallelujah"" or to clap after a serious riff. It is neither heavy gospel nor heavy jazz but it is pleasant. I actually preferred those cuts with vocals over the instrumental cuts. Folks who like Wynans-type gospel will enjoy the CD. For me, if the CD were a movie, it would be a rental."
5,Excellent!!,"If I only listened to one song on this CD (I want to be a Christian), it was WELL worth the purchase! Amazing rendition by Kirk, Duke, and Jackson! You won't go wrong with this one."
4,Pleasant introduction to Beethoven's symphonies,"I recently ordered this box set from Amazon. I must say that I've enjoyed the performances on the CDs thus far. I have to confess that I am a Herbert von Karajan fan. I love the sounds that he coaxed from the Berliner Philharmoniker, and enjoy his 1962 recordings of Beethoven immensly.That being said, there is much to be said for the chamber orchestra being used in the performance of Beethoven's work. We know that the orchestras of Beethoven's time were much smaller than the symphony orchestras of today. There are certain details that can sometimes be obscured by larger orchestras.These are perfectly acceptable performances of Beethoven's work. While they lack the dramatic sweep of Karajan's or Bernstein's work, they are worth looking into, especially for those interested in acquiring a budget collection of the symphonies. There are better performances out there to be sure, but this is still quite a good collection overall."
4,Not a double bill,"An earlier reviewer mentioned that the DVD is a double bill and didn't enjoy the second feature. That was the same mistake I made when watching this film. I thought it was 2 films and actually turned it off, disappointed. Some time later I turned it on again, willing to give it a second chance. Well, to my surprise it wasn't a double bill and the second half is actually better when you understand what's going on. I saw this movie months ago but for some reason it's stayed with me. It's good if you give it a chance and I think the final scene is beautiful and tragic and the same time. See it as a statement of the sacrifices we make for true love. One man wants to be with another, no matter the cost. and another man (the object of his affections) seeks freedom from a living nightmare. In order for either of these goals to be reached one man must be killed by the other. the standoff in the final scene is hauntingly beautiful and stays with you. at least it did with me."
4,Very Good,I was very pleased with this purchase. I was impressed with the variety of instruments used in this production especially the horns.
5,Old but good.,This is a collection of mystery stories with a twists. Each story has it's own set of characters and are basically unrelated so you don't have to read them in order. The Baroness has an easy to read style with enough description to create the scene that draws you into the story. I enjoyed each one
4,rock on rock,i find this c.d really pretty good what a great variety of artists from really roocking to positively christian i would say if you love a variety of rock music i would get this one
4,"Good, albeit terse, murder/love story","John T. Lescroart's 'The 13th Juror' is a compelling novel that pits the truth against a complex web of lies all in one book. Good character development and one big red herring (too big, in fact) will keep readers guessing to the very end!Lescroart's niche is in upbeat and lively prose. His character's speed is always moving. His reading is easy on the eyes and imaginative, though sometimes too familiar with any genre now bursting with now all-too-familiar plots. Unique twist and evidence will keep readers turning pages!This one is a buy!"
3,Disappointing ending!,I am getting tired of the liberties mystery authors take with their novels.Talk about loose ends. What happened to the hitman in the hotel for one? just paranoia? And the ending right out of a Perry Mason TV episode. I should have been warned in the reviews in the beginning of the book that John Grisham fans would love this book.Figures
5,Jack-c,"Excellent service, what can go wrong with downloading a Kindle book? The book is as described in the description. I'm enjoying it very much."
4,They Call It a Page Turner and They're Right,"I bought this three-year-old legal thriller while on vacation in Uruguay because it was the least objectionable book in English I could find. I'm glad I discovered it--even at $11 for a paperback. The book is not as slick as Grisham and probably longer than should be but it's an easy read and quite engrossing. It's a nice look inside the legal system, a story about a cop-turned-attorney and his first murder trial. The lawyer is likeable, the client not so much, which makes it all the more fun. I hate to even hint at the ending because I get angry at reviews that do. I'll just say, I wasn't disappointed"
5,The 13th Juror,"Excellent!!! Got it quickly, read it almost as quickly. Came before promised, in condition promised. Thanks!"
2,Don't Mess With My Iliad,"I bought this book for the activities, which were okay (but I thought the Pyramids! book in the series was better for that), for some future homeschooling programs. It was fine until I hit page 31 and the ""Super-Short Version"" of The Iliad. I stopped reading.What they presented was, in fact, a synopsis of the Trojan war stories. I failed to find anything in this version that *occurred* in The Iliad. The poem of that name is about the chain of events leading up to the death of the Trojan hero, Hector. Anyone who read this synopsis and then later tried to read the Homeric poem would wonder where the horse was and if they accidentally skipped the famous argument settled by Paris.Reading other reviews I see that the authors played fast and loose with facts in other areas.I am now very disappointed with this book. I don't recommend buying it. If you want to use it, cherry-pick the activities from a library copy, but don't believe everything you read in it."
1,Pretty Stupid,"Save your money, this video is amateurish, and anyone with a brain could figure out those moves on their own. Save your money."
2,"A re-release of old scooby, beware!","I was unaware that this DVD contains old Scooby-doo episodes from the 1970s original series, Scooby-doo where are you?. As I already have that series, it was a waste of time buying this, it is just a re-release with new cover art. Next time I will wait for someone to list the episode titles so I know what I'm buying. The episodes are good, of course, but it is much cheaper to buy them as part of the complete series. Ok if you have no desire to own much Scooby or just something to keep the kids quiet..but in saying that this material is quite old,and won't keep older kids amused for long, unless they like the show."
3,"Beautiful, but others are better...","This is an extremely beautiful book which I purchased at the London restaurant. However, the recipes I've used have not worked very well, especially in comparison to the fanstastic fare turned out by the restaurant chefs. I feel that Kasma Loha_unchit's books are much better at explaining exactly how to achieve the sophisticated and complex flavors of Thai cuisine."
4,Gritty,"The story line is one to forget if you tend to avoid the gritty in our cities. You won't, however, forget how we'll the author writes and you will look for more."
3,"kids, drugs are bad","I like Tribe 8. They're not my favorite band, but I enjoy them. The same applies to this novel by one of the members of the aforementioned group. It was a decent book... and it certainly was fast-paced, but there was entirely too much emphasis on drugs. It's like the gay ""Trainspotting"" or something, and I'm not too hot on that. Also, Breedlove is really kinda obsessed with having sex with drag queens, I don't really understand that part but whatever.... this book is pretty good, but I wouldn't buy it as a Christmas gift for someone or anything. Yeah..."
5,Much Better Than Season 1,"I watch all the British series like this one, and thought season 1 had so many problems. Too many to go into, but the constant shaking camera trick was enough to make you seasick. Season 2 is totally different, including some of the cast. Now it is first rate. I'm sure that if this series was like season 2 in the beginning, it would have continued for many more years. Too bad they got it right too late, now I want more."
4,Brings backs memories....,"I remembered this movie from when I was in High School.. and watching... yes I admit it... it was a corny off beat comedy.. but then again what 80s comedy was not like that... thats what made them so good.. they just don't make them like they used to... but most of the public have turned into a bunch of politically correct amoebas..who are ""harmed or offended"" by today videos games, something that was said in a movie, etc.. Many of the people today who give these movies bad reviews were not even a twinkle in their pops eyes around during the time of the original release!! There were alot of good movies during the 80s that have been long sense overlooked and forgotten such as: Up the Creek, Up the Academy, Runaway, Mr Mom, etc... all these were movies I watched and loved during my life as a teenager..."
4,Missed hearing from Griffin and Sabine,"Once again, as he did in his Griffin and Sabine trilogy, Nick Bantock combines, in a most clever manner, both mystical thoughts and ideas using letters and postcards in his newest book, The Gryphon. With wonderful illustrations of stamps from far away places and beauiful calligraphy on notes which fold out from actual envelopes, the author engages his readers with further tales about Griffin and Sabine. While this book is a bit darker than his others and also engages two more characters in the search for Griffin and Sabine, overall this title is a welcome addition to the first three books which were so very unique when they were first published.Now, after almost a decade's absence from the literary scene, its nice to know that Griffin and Sabine are alive and well. But if we still don't know exactly where they are in the world, one wonders if Mr. Bantock is having too much fun writing these books to ever let us find out."
1,Know when to quit,"Griffen & Sabine captured my imagination and kept me thinking and talking about it for weeks! Unfortunately, Bantock's latest installment in the series proves it's over --or in this case, should be over. There is nothing fresh or original here, simply an excuse to squeeze out three more books for Griffen & Sabine junkies (like me)to spend our book $$ on in the hopes that the magic is still there (it isn't). The mystery is frustrating because it relies on the next book in order to make any sense of the story and therefore cannot stand alone as a piece of literature like the books in the previous trilogy. I am a disappointed Griffen & Sabine fan."
5,My Perspective,"While browsing through the bookstore the other day, a delightfully illustrated book caught my eye. It reminded me of something I had seen before, perhaps a sequel, I thought. Glancing through the book, The Gryphon, I recalled the Griffin and Sabine trilogy, and promptly leaned against a wall to read. I became caught up as a new mystery unraveled and new characters emerged. My mind explored the new possibilites and stretched to new bounderies that left me confused and disappointed when the book ended. What will happen to Griffen and Sabine? What about Matt and Isabelle? Bantock weaves an amazing story that transcends the reading experience with actual postcards and letters. Hats off to Bantock, I can't wait to see what happens next."
3,Artful But Disappointing,"I am an admiring fan of Bantock - I find him highly creative and artful. The graphics and concept of this book continues the rich vein of Griffin & Sabine, but the story is not complete. He does continue the plot line, adding new elements which kept me interested. It is as though he wrote half or three-quarters of a story. There is no resolution. There needs to be a sequel to this book. Which is a shame - I would have bought his next book anyway. I can't get enough of his interesting letters, cards and additions. Still, I recommend this book, if for no other reason than the creativity."
5,Perfect gift.,My friend was so happy with this gift. He does part time farming besides his full time job.He owns several farm tractors so was happy he would be able to put the sign on his favorite tractor.Thank you..
1,RIP-OFF! Only 3 Cartoons lasting 20 minutes total,"Warners has hit rock bottom here! Wasting a whole DVD with just 20 minutes of cartoons!It is not like they are paying any real residuals to release these, none of the creators are making any big money off of this, Just Warner Brothers.Here are the meager offerings:""Apes of Wrath,"" - Bugs Bunny - 7 minutes""Stork Naked"" - Daffy Duck - 7 minutes""Bad Ol' Putty Tat."" - Tweety & Sylvester - 7 minutesNOBODY SHOULD BUY THIS when there are better, affordable Looney Tunes DVD sets out there!"
2,Not Unleashed,"When it has came down the Looney Tunes on video, there just have been a lack of stand-out DVD's that work just like the Looney Tunes: Golden Collection Volumes 1-6. So they have now decided to do mini-collections that have not thrived to make them worth buying. With The Looney Tunes: Unleashed, it is quite honestly the worst DVD collection of Looney Tunes on home video. There are only 3 of the classic cartoons from Bugs Bunny, Tweety & Sylvester and Daffy Duck on this collection. The DVD features 3 shorts, Bad Ol' Putty Tat, Stork Naked, and Apes Of Wrath. The cartoons each are still funny today, like they were made around 60 years ago. While the idea was there, the gripe is it isn't worth the money. There are better DVD's out there for new and die hard looney tunes fans worth the money, but Looney Tunes: Unleashed, will possibly be worth turning your back on.Price: D-Shorts: C+Overall: D"
3,"good presentation on a hard topic, but outdated","The title more or less covers the idea -- the book is well written. Steidel presents the topics in a way the reader can absorb the material without feeling overwhelmed by the math involved. The book covers only introductory material, also including multi degree of freedom systems, continuous systems, and random vibrations. There are numerous GOOD examples and over 500 exercises, which is a lot for a textbook of this type. Sadly, no computer applications are presented in the book, this edition being from 1989, and should any new edition be in the works, it MUST contain computer applications to be of any use. Not using computers limits the student to working with 2 degree of freedom systems, no more. I'd suggest this book as backup for other more advanced and up to date books that do include modern applications but lack the thorough explanations in Steidel's book. The reader might like to check my comments on Thomson's Vibration book."
1,Beware - this book is a paperback book,"The description of this book is incorrect. This is a paperback book, not a hardcover."
1,Terrible!,"I cannot recommend this product. I bought a few, excited to try my hand at sprouting.Well, today is the 3rd day, and the sprouts have been doing well! The alfalfa outgrew the clover and mung beans, so I decided to harvest some of it. Imagine my disgust when I unscrewed the lid and found that the screen had turned black along the edge! I wouldn't call it rust -- it's not red -- more like some less-friendly oxidation. (Nickel? Chromium?) And the black wasn't just some surface-finish, but a fine powder. I tried eating some of the sprouts, but couldn't, because they had a very strong metallic taste. Possibly poisonous, but definitely not wholesome. What a waste of my first batch of sprouts.I won't be deterred from this little hobby, but I'm going to pick up some of the plastic perforated lids instead.Notes: The edges are rough-cut, not finished or folded over. Also, if you do decide to ignore my recommendation and buy this product, it is designed to fit a widemouth jar."
3,Does the job but had the rust issue also,"I don't know if it is the ring causing the rust or the sprouting screen(probably is the ring but I dont have anything else to use with it), but mine also rusted around the edges the first use and was dripping brown liquid when draining. I also bought some plastic screw on lids and I prefer those now. The seller did ship very fast though. They should sell these with a stainless screw on ring to go with it."
1,ringed with rust,"After my second use, rust developed on both the screen and the ball metal ring andbrown water steeped out when draining. Now trying cheese cloth, but may have to trya plastic screen. I would not purchase this."
4,Nice Product,"This is good for sprouting grains and beans. I ended up getting the plastic kind as well because these began to rust just after a few uses, even with drying them. They still work well though."
4,helper,Works well for the price. Screen does rust a bit but scrubbing with steel wool takes care of the problem.
2,I'm letting it go.,"Something came over me. Forget Hitler, Forget communism and forget the childish bickering. I look at our back and forth reviews and I think to myself, what am I doing? Hitler was a murderer and a thug and a coward. Lenin wasn't to much different. Both were revolutionaries and both failed. I'm just letting it go. And since I was the one that attacked you first socialist Metal Head, I apologize, i'm sorry. And you're right, I should just write reviews on the damn product, lol. I just want to say that I accept your beliefs socialist metal head, and I accept you. Forgive me. I'm done of this bullSh&t. I have a new look on life now and fighting over the past isn't worth it. You may still bash me on reviews but that is ok, I deserve it. That is what I get for starting stupid fights. Hating people just isn't worth it, might as well see everyone as human beings no matter what race or belief system. I'm sorry once again socialist metal head, forgive a stupid man like me. I'm out"
1,LAME - REPETITIVE - BORING,"It is honestly bands like DYING FETUS that give metal a bad name. Honestly, you can not understand a word they say and there is no talent involved, NONE. Let me bang on the drums and play simple riffs as fast as I can and scream like a PIG, then maybe I can make an album. If you want to listen to real metal bands, with real talent. Check out some of the following - OLD Metallica, Symphonyx, older In Flames and Soilwork, Killswitch engage, testament, and many many many more......and guess what? You can understand the words!! And they also play some technical riffs and solo's!!!"
5,An all-out assault,"WOW! This album is the heaviest album I own and probably the heaviest I've ever heard. Blast beats never cease. Crushing riffs and mind-blowing drumming rank this album among the top modern death metal albums of all time. You can't say enough about the superb job John Gallager and Jason Netherton do at approaching the album with a dual-vocal style. Deep, almost indecipherable growls coupled with higher-pitched vocals (which are still deep anyway) make this album very intriguing to listen to. Any metalhead who doesn't own this album should be ashamed and go out and pick it up as soon as possible."
4,Destroy The Political Slander,"Dying Fetus is a most wonderous band of brutality and the ""Get out there and kill something"" attitude. I have liked DF for a while, but then they went political. Now I know not ALL songs are political, but when some songs suddenly start singing about politics, it usually means one of two things: 1) it is ignorant music like the anarchistic punks (if u believe in anarchy, please grab a blow torch and fry what little brains you have so you will be too retarded to voice ur stupid opinions) or 2) i disagree with their political belief which ruins the song for me. Thankfully Dying Fetus's vocals are hard to understand if you listen to it casually without paying much attention, so I listen to this CD for the musical value when I am out biking and busy concentrating on other stuff."
2,i luv em but thier typical,"I honestly do love this band, so dont get me wrong but i find this album to be a lot like the other bands out their. Iv owned this album for about a full year now and iv earned them a few fans in my area, so i truly DO NOT think they suck. but i reivew albums and movies a lot, and it is extremly hard to get a lot of stars out of me. two isnt bad. you gotta be lucky to get 4 and you gotta be the fierce and the flawless to even get near a 5. but if your a fan of this genre i higly recomend this band to, as well as this album. Children of Bodom Rules the Ruins!"
5,the boys from Annapolis destroy the boy band opposition,"Dying Fetus,hailing from my home state of Maryland,deliver an all out assault on the ears with this brutal release. Second only to maybe Nile in terms of heaviness, Dying Fetus will leave you spitting out your teeth 5seconds into the first track ""Praise the Lord"" and will keep you reeling until the final track ""Justifiable Homicide"". Absolutely brutal. Absolutely flawless. Undeniably metal. The new hope for metal in the next millenium, Dying Fetus."
3,By the Still Waters by Vance Havner,"This book is in terrific shape for a 71 year old book. It was copyrighted in 1934, but it has 116 pages instead of the 96 listed in the computer.I have no idea of it's value, but I desire to sell it."
1,Outdated - not even usable!,"Unfortunately, I should have noticed reviews for this book were almost a decade old! The BCII (personality/interests) test included with the book is only available on a FLOPPY DISK! Going online to the author's website leads to a $99 fee for the test. Without the test results, the book itself, which analyzes the different profiles and career matches, is useless. What a let down."
4,Choosing or Changing a Career In Business? Buy This Book.,"""Discovering Your Career In Business"" will open your eyes to the aspects of your personality that directly influence your success and happiness in business. The authors, a pair of Harvard PHDs, take it one step further and help match you with a career that fits the true you.The user-friendly Business Career Interest Inventory (BCII) software tool that comes along with this book is indispensable. The BCII, through a series of seemingly simple questions, provides incredibly meaningful insight into one's true business interests. The BCII results are easily interpreted and translated into a career profile (i.e., what you should be doing in the business field).In short, this book provides invaluable tools and guidance to help determine which aspect of business, if any, is truly right for you."
2,This book is a waste of time!,"I fit within the narrow target audience of the book, and found it to be completely useless. The whole book could have been reduced down to one chapter. It is hard to stay awake through example after example that illustrate points that are pretty intuitive."
1,Don't bother,"This book was a waste of time. The authors were too wordy. They spent a lot of time boosting their egos - telling you the things they had done, even though it didn't help the reader at all. Throughout the book they recapped too much. Each chapter wasted 2 to 5 pages describing what was coming in the chapter. Points and paragraphs were continually restated and repeated. The book could have been 1/4 of the size. There were way too many case studies, and very few were of any help. This book was a waste of money and a waste of time."
4,Funny,"I am personal friends with one of the comedians and decided to purchase this video. I will be honest and say that it takes a lot to make me laugh. I was really pleased with the first three comedians. Perry reminded me of the old school comedians. Joey Wells had a soft humor that catches up to you later. Joe Blount is adorable. He's obviously enjoying himself on the stage and is very bold in his unorthodox style. I enjoyed him very much. For some reason I couldn't really get into Leslie but she was okay. As much as I liked this video once you watch it once, its kind of hard to keep watching it expecting to laugh. Very funny though. :)"
5,Handy to have,"Handy book to have, One of those books to have if you are looking for another view on the subject matter."
4,Other Importances of this Book,"On a weekend with a friend at a B&B in Vermont I discovered this book on the sunporch. I found the lanaguage strangely drawing. It provided a new way to look at many seasonal experiences, including a positive way to view death and renewal. I have used phrases from this book when doing eulogies for people who have died and whose family members are struggling with acceptance...Now I have found a copy for myself. I am well satisfied (and not a pagan)."
4,sick underground film doc.,"all thumbs up please. indeed this is no happy, go-luck, hollywood film with a nice sweet ending. its an doc. of undergroud films published by hit'n'run home video. this film not for the faint. the film contains original works from: gg allin, mike diana, full force frank, god loves over dose, annie sprinkle, turbo tom, x meets y, and many others. amazon has fail to properly review this film (as you some has already bought it thinking it was something eles, good thing it stayed unopened) on the sleve it reads ""the material on AFFLICTION is frequently extreme, often hilarious, and, on occasion, enjoyably nauseating... a testament to the health of the underground documentary.&quot:"
5,Slide that Glides,I am a relative newcomer to the world of lap style slide guitar and I didn't know a whole lot about this type of slide bar. I looked at it and it seemed logical and comfortable to use. The truth is it worked out perfectly for me and I enjoy using my new toy very much. It is light weight and easy to handle making learning to play lap style more fun than work.
5,"perfect, natural fit.","I ordered a different (slightly cheaper) slide before this one, and then had to order the Lap Dawg because the other didn't feel right (too narrow/etc.).This Dawg has a great, natural curve and is super easy/comfortable to hold (I'm a girl with small fingers, and I know some guys who have big meaty hands that also love this slide)."
4,Love it,"It fits my hand nicely and the weight seems to be perfect. I'm not an experienced dobro player, but it's a heckuva lot better than the brass pipe i was using."
4,Glad to have Johnny in the house!,"This is enjoyable to read and we're happy to own it. Since this is such a timeless tale, we feel it's a must for any library. The artwork is unique and the tale is cleverly written in rhyme. It's thicker than most paperback books this size."
2,Free SF Reader,"Definitely not the action/adventure hero I was looking for as a child. American, too, I think, so that meant I was less interested. when it comes right down to it, planting fruit is really not that interesting a story if you are looking for something fun."
5,awesome bear,my little girl loves this vary soft grate gift for kids or loved ones if your in the market to please someone importent to you this is grate
2,Disappointed,The panda bear's eyes did not match...I have never seen a panda bear with eyes like this.
3,622 Texas Birds,"This guide has some nifty features (shows hawk silhouettes and under-markings), but suffers from small photos. It's handy to have around the house and helpful when teamed with a second guide. That way you have two chances to see the markings and identify a bird. Some photos have leaves or branches obscuring the bird's markings.The placement of the photos in a separate section from the descriptions makes using the book a bit awkward. It causes the birder to flip back and forth a lot.The description includes a range map, habitat, voice, markings and similar birds."
2,Would not recommend,"We have used this book for 1 year and constantly complain about the pictures, maps, drawings, descriptions of bird calls, etc. We use it at home daily and have found it inadequate. I do not recommend this book for a serious bird watcher."
5,Mrs. Dorothy Deckelman,These shoes are the only shoes I can wear. I have a hammer toe and I can not wear any other shoes. I just wish that the soft walk company would make more colors in this design. I refuse to have an operation on my feet. I really don't know if I have arthritis in my toes or if it is hammertoe. These shoes pamper my feet so that I can walk for longer periods of time. Please pass this information along
3,This Could Have Been A Great Cobra Toy!,"Why does Hasbro insist on putting handles and grips on the bottom and rear of thier toys? This takes away from the look and feel of the toy. Take the Night Adder. Where the landing gear should be, you have a handle so the person looking at the plane can ""fly it"" then pull a trigger to make the rear cockpit spin. I personally would rather move different features on my own. The Addre does look cool. But Hasbro let us down with this one. Think about it before you spend your money."
2,disappointed,I was very disappointed in this book. Seemed more like a sales pitch for her company. The Official LaStone Therapy Manual is much better.
2,Slow,The author is very knowledgable on Stone Therapy. I found this to be like a primer for someone who has NO knowledge at all on Stone Therapy. I found it very slow reading. A shorter history of the author and her life could have been done in two pages. For me it was like a lot of non important filler was put in the book to make it longer then what it would have been otherwise. The actual information needed could have been all put together in one chapter. Maybe it would be better if the author wrote a more advanced book on Stone Therapy with more attention on detail and stone matter then other non essential filler.
4,A rich and rewarding play - to be read and performed,"Polly Teale's play version of Bronte's classic, ""Jane Eyre"" is remarkable not only for its true connection to the book, but even more for its ability to create a world in which the Victorian characters can live, without ostracising a modern audience. I am an acting student from Queensland whose university put on this play, and after watching it five times (voluntarily!)I can say that it never fails to rouse all the emotions. There are some beautiful scenes in this play, particularly at the end of each play, which still cause me to hold my breath. The characters of Bertha and Jane complement each other extraordinarily well, and Polly manages to convey both the passion and the control which rule most of the character's lives. I strongly recommend this play, though I believe its greatest strength lies in the actual performance of the text."
5,brutality at it's best,Pure insanity! Just freakin' awesome. Scott Hull is one hell of a player and JR has a haunting voice that you just can't get out of your mind.
1,You've got to be kidding me,"this is a horrible album,... great lyrics? you cant even hear what they are saying!They sound like a pack of dogs barking together and then getting run over by a truck.It is people like this who are the reason my taxes are so high, I dont need to be paying welfare and food stamps for these ...[people]."
4,The very best Pig Destroyer out there,"Do yourself a favor and go up and select purchase above. 1-button it to show how confident you are in the quality of this CD. This is the best Pig Destroyer CD (close 2nd is Terryfier) and you cannot go wrong. Nasty, hard as they come and diverse - you will love this one... definately!"
4,Classic Seiko Tank Watch,"I am very pleased with this watch. The style is simple, classic.A great watch for any occasion!"
1,Fails to be CyberPunk,"While an interesting read, this module does not stand up to actual game play. It COMPLETELY lacks any of the proper themes and moods of CyberPunk."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"The second book in the Jinian trilogy, even though her name does notappear in the title, as in the other books about the female charactersof the Truge Game series.Jinian, Peter and friends are on the road. They must deal with enemies and adversaries, both human and not so human."
4,"Great fun to work with, but be aware that they are somewhat delicate","I've loved Stikfas ever since seeing them years ago, and have collected several. I have noticed that the wings on figures like this pterodactyl can require delicate handling, and support when attaching, or the tiny ball connectors can break, but it is a great piece nonetheless, and the companion that glows in the dark is also fun."
4,Little plastic dinos,"I took a risk. There were absolutely no reviews on these little guys at the time that I was going to buy them. I saw the $5 price for two figures and I instantly thought they would be good for a stop motion with a few xevoz I had lying around. They arrived yesterday, I built them with no problem (think zoidz, without motors), and then I realized something: they're tiny. The xevoz tower over these mini dinos, preventing them from flying on the dactyls.Size (they are about 3"" high by 9"" wingspan) aside, these are nice figures. Each one has two interchangeable heads, one with a crest and no teeth, and one with teeth and without a crest. One figure is a bone-ish color, and the other is glow in the dark (not green). They are very poseable, and I am overall happy with them."
4,"It's good, ... but not perfect!","It has everything you imagine ... except it doesn't have applications like P990i which is coming soon. In other words, you are bound to what W900i supports and that's it, but in P990i you can update your mobile to support other files too.If you don't care much about the cost then I advice you to wait for P990i, otherwise go for this one, you'll not be missing a lot from Sony's new technology."
2,"Some of it works on XP, some doesn't","Two out of the three games works on an XP machine, but the one I really wanted to work (Tomb Raider 1) did not. It made my monitor go all funky display-wise. The product description for this product says nothing about Tomb Raider 1 working for only Win95, or DOS. Caveat Emptor (Let the buyer beware)."
2,Gratuitous violence,"There's no question that these three games are a lot of fun, and that children love them. There's also no question that the software itself is flawless. The games do not (unlike many others) crash. They run, and run, and run.On the other hand, that's exactly the problem. Like too many computer and video games, these Tomb Raider titles are filled with gratuitous violence.The games should not, in my view, be rated as they are. For my sensitivities, I'd have preferred an ""M"" rating. Parents, beware; children under 15 should not use these games.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
1,An anthology of overrated crap,"Face it, the one reason these utterly awful games ever got any recognition was for their zephyr chested star. For God's sake, she's a computer generated graphic image!Everything about these games leaves me wondering why oh why they have achieved such universal acclaim? Is there actually some appeal in the overcomplicated, vindictively fiddly controls? Or maybe it's the uninspiring level design, the flat, underwhelming graphics (even for their time), or maybe it's the impossibly cryptic puzzles and diamond hard gameplay? I mean, I like a challenge but this is just over the top.What is it that made these games so popular? How could so many people be won over by a shallow, soullessly designed and impossibly proportioned heroine? It certainly isn't the flat, unoriginal plot. Tomb Raider sucks ass, play Soul Reaver if you want a proper adventure game and leave this to the rabid dogs!"
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"As the others have said...make sure the plug works when the car is turned off. My car has two plugs. The one that works when the car is off is by the gearshift. I don't even bother unplugging it when I drive since it is out of my light of sight.It looks great in the dark and I believe would deter a thief that didn't give it a very close look with a flashlight. I suspect this would fail on close inspection since it is raised off the console (though I really don't know what common installed alarms look like).Lastly, the ease of use for this device beats having to hotwire the car or bother with batteries with other products. I really doubt this little thing is taking enough energy from the battery to make much of a difference to the battery's longevity."
4,Loving Family Sisters,These are another nice addition to the Loving Family Dollhouse. The real hair is a nice touch however we have had to restyle ours a few times. Very nice detailing! Much better than the newest dolls for this dollhouse. These are beautifully made.
3,rape trap,the movie was good in same part. she went to prison for the crime. the good part was the end where she had a baby. the actor are good except the husband she marrried. it was not slow but good
1,Misunderstood product...NOT A SUBSCRIPTION!!!,"Misunderstood as a magazine subscription. This was purchased as a gift for my boss. He was a little underwhelmed with 1 magazine and to top it off it was an old issue from 2006. However, shipping and condition of the magazine was fantastic considering it was from 2006."
3,GOOD!!!,"Pros:It works, it's fast and SATA is a plus.Cons: Not much faster than a Seagate (7200, 32MB cache).It runs really hot!!"
3,Raptor X 150GB,"The price was great or I would not have purchased the upgrade. Performance is outstanding but the drive has a whine, high pitch during use. Would really be nice if WD made the SATA II version."
4,Very un-Coltrane,"For a tribute to JC made up of his compositions, nothing could sound more unlike him - and that's okay. After all, what would be the point? Mr. Tyner has evolved as an artist, and Mr. Foster is stylistically worlds apart from Elvin Jones. Nevertheless, when I listen to these renditions, an inevitable comparison is invoked with the originals, and the element I find missing is the glue that the very unsung Jimmy Garrison provided. George Mraz just leaves me cold. He has more chops than the majority of bassists, but to me he's technically overwrought, and I strongly dislike that thin, transducer-enhanced tone. For lack of a better word, I miss a certain ""organic"" ingredient that I found in the original recordings."
5,Mrs. Pollifax on the China Station,"ALL of the Mrs. Pollifax mysteries are great reading! There are 14 books with Mrs. Pollifax and I am not finished with all 14 just yet. I have 4 more to go and can't put them down! They move fast and keep you interested, making it difficult to pause! A friend loaned me eight of the books and I had to buy the other six! I just had to have them! I wish there were more! A little old grandmother, smart as a whip, and karate expert, too! Who'd guessed it? Picture of innocence - but not so! She's a woman to be reckoned with! And a true heroine, too! Not your typical international spy!"
5,Great Stuff.,"Jon's work is awesome. I was a witness to many of the events in this book, and Jon has an amazing ability to paint an entertaining, yet true picture of life with Spoke. Anyone who enjoys music, life, and the spirit of punk rock will enjoy this book. It's too bad it doesn't come with a limited edition Spoke napkin. Viva pastacore!"
3,rival toaster oven,"6 Slice Counter Top OvenThis is a good toaster oven, but not the best I've ever seen. It is slow on making toast and it does not toast evenly."
4,Loves Blue China,"This oven is a good buy for the price. I researched this product pretty thoroughly and also read a lot of customer reviews of competitive ovens. This may well be a case where the most expensive is not necessarily the best buy. Features that were important to me: a crumb tray that removes from the front, dials that are easy to read and use, vents from the sides, has a quiet fan, and is elevated by feet so that the counter doesn't become hot. The size is spacious and will hold a 12"" pizza pan, but is not overly large and fits well on the counter. It has a sleek design and comes with baking, broiling and pizza pans. It is slow to make toast and needs to prewarm well for baking. The unit cannot function without the timer which controls the power, so if the item being cooked is done before the timer setting goes off, the timer must be manually adjusted or the oven continues heating. I am very pleased with it so far, but have not yet had time to do any serious baking."
2,The timer mechanism must have a problem,"Our oven worked wonderfully for a few months. Then the timer broke. At least ours turns the oven off after a few seconds, unlike the other poor reviewer who has the timer stay on.We are moving and I can't find the receipt. I called about it because it would still be under warranty. It's production numbers show that it was produced within a year of the failure. So I am going to try to get a replacement, even without the receipt. Otherwise, we are out a good chunk of money.I also have a Cuisinart toaster oven, love it, except it won't do a 12 inch pizza. If it did, I would have bought another one of those, even though it costs more (a lot more).diabar"
2,Doesn't meet durability expectations.,"We've had this Rival CO606 Toaster oven for 2 1/2 years and were generally pleased with it, except for occasional weird squawking noises from the convection fan, and for the lack of any way to turn off the convection for normal baking. We especially liked its ability to handle a 12"" pizza, which it baked very well. It also performed well at toasting, baking small casseroles, pies, etc. We never used it for broiling.However, one of the calrod broil/toast elements burst with a blast of white light while toasting, and I have been unable to locate any source for replacement parts. No one expects things to last forever, but our previous toaster oven lasted closer to ten years, not 2 1/2."
2,Would return it if I didn't have to mail it.,"After reading the reviews on Amazon I cautiously ordered this mostly because most reviewers gave it good marks for even toasting. If I could return it locally and did not have to mail it back to Amazon I would return it. The Red power light went out almost immediately and if it were not for the noise it makes, yes, I said noise, you could easily forget that you did not turn it off. With the power light not working you can't tell by looking at it if you accidentally left it on. The noise can be minor or at times very annoying. I would almost say that it rattles at times. Cooking and toasting though are both very good in my opinion and that is why I'm keeping it. I can get over the noise factor and the light not working. The unit cooks in less time and more evenly than my last Toaster-Oven. Two stars overall, no stars for quality and four stars for cooking."
5,Excellent choice!,"Before purchasing this oven I did research for about six weeks to be sure that I got the best buy for the money. I now know more about counter top convection ovens than I ever thought possible.I have been totally satisfied with my purchase of this toaster oven. It performs as described and looks really nice on the counter.I have made cornbread (the best ever), pizza (crisp and delicious), and biscuits. The oven browns and cooks perfectly.The two racks make it easy to prepare different foods at the same time.The fan is not silent - so what?I highly recommend this oven to anyone considering this type purchase."
2,"worked great for 18 months, then threw sparks","Received as a wedding gift, and my wife and I were thrilled with the unit for about 18 months. Then it started throwing a burning/electrical smell. A couple weeks later, I caught it throwing sparks out the side!Since I was out of the 1 yr warranty, I figured no harm could be done by trying to repair it myself.Found two 1N5408 diodes, one of which was burnt and snapped in half. Cost to purchase new diodes - about $0.25.Cost to purchase new toaster oven - $50 minimum.So if you have this unit, find that it starts makes an electrical burning odor, and have a soldering gun, it can be repaired in a very cost effective manner.Regardless - a toaster oven only lasting 18 months is pretty poor, which is why I rate this only 2 stars."
1,Potential DANGEROUS Flaw BEWARE!,"Worked fine for one year. Then the top elements stopped working. I took a closer look inside the oven and could see that two top elements had WARPED. They were so bent that they were touching the inside-top of the oven. I used this mainly as a toaster, so the toasting function was used 5x a week. Rival has not recalled the item. The top element warping problem is a DANGEROUS flaw. DO NOT BUY!"
2,A little irritating.,"I am distinctly unimpressed by this textbook. At times the text is insultingly simple and other times it's simply the author trying to make you think that he's more intelligent than you. Also, EVERYTHING is global warming's fault according to this book, you will be quite annoyed if you don't accept that idea as an absolute."
1,piece of crap,"this book isnt worth what they're asking for it. if you can get around it, DO NOT BUY THIS PICE OF CRAP BOOK! IT'S NOT WORTH IT!"
3,Not for my kind of use,"I am using this quad beam transducer on a Humminbird 787-c2. The unit does not have much range in the quad beam mode. Also another problem is when you select Quadbeam you get the top display of the other transducers and the bottom half shows left and right quad beam but ""NO GPS"".When I am trying to find a wreck I need the GPS also. I think I will put it up for auction. It is hardly used.I wish I had bought a 900 series Humminbird with the side scanning transducer.Patrick"
4,Transducer,the Transducer workes on the humminbird gps/fishfinder on the boat it will pick up the fish in the water under the boat
5,Great mix of dances,"I play in a country band in Reno, Nevada and I bought some of these dvds to educate myself on what the crowd expects. This one was extremely helpful. It gave me a great overview of the most popular dances. Not everything is two-step and it's great if you can know what else everyone is doing. This dvd does have some great two-step but its also got all the other ones you need to know to be up with everybody. Excellant sampler!!"
2,I'm still left wondering...,"I'm left wondering when the author would address why it is womenwho are currently in place like VMI aren't demanding theirequality to be available for the draft. If they're so gung-ho to get in and be in combat roles, why not pursue opening the draft to all? In my mind, all this who gets to do what is a mute point because when it comes right down to it women never have and never will die in anywhere near equal numbers to men because there's always more ways to opt out: not being able to be drafted and getting pregnant.As a former grunt I often mused it was ""unfair"" that we had to rot in the field without a shower for weeks, but army regulationsstated that due to ""feminine hygiene issues"", the womenfolk got to go to the rear at least once a week."
5,Real nice tone - at last,My Martin D-28 has had a piezo pickup but I could never get an even tone out of it. This Thinline Gold+Plus is just the ticket. A bit tricky to get it adjusted with every string at the same level - if you don't like tinkering then it would be a good investment to get it installed. But I eventually got it right and am really happy.
5,It is what it is.. getting started,"It is what it is.. getting started with his wet on wet technique. what better way to explain it then to show you the tools needed. It may be 30 minutes, but it will show you how to use his products to create your own masterpiece"
4,Great for getting started.,"This video is great for someone who wants to learn about oil painting and what is needed to get started. It teaches you about the basic equipment and materials and then teaches you how to use them in your painting. It begins with teaching you about what is needed to prime your canvas and how to do it, then progresses to how to use the various sizes and shapes of brushes in a multitude of ways to create amazing effects such as trees, waves, waterfall, reflections, mountain peaks and snow on mountain tops and snow on trees, logs, buildings, etc. Bob Ross teaches you how to use various knives to create amazing effects, and how to mix and blend the paints on your pallet and also on canvas. It's a great basic video to get someone who is beginning from scratch about what to buy and how to use what to buy."
4,Short but sweet,"This television studio performance of the firt album's big hits (Paranoid, Iron Man, Black Sabbath and a cover of Blue Suede Shoes) is a must for die hard fans, the quality is suprising, the production is corny but that is the charm. The only drawback is that it is bery short."
3,Yet another half-assed Pioneer release.,"Yet another bad Pioneer DVD. ONLY four of the original BS Musicladen performances. Pioneer seems to not have that much confidence in the storage ability of a DVD, according to their track record. They seem to have the tendency with their anime releases to only put 3-4 episodes on it, as though they are afraid that if they go any further, the disc will won't handle it any longer. But the picture is crap any way. -_-4 And it shows here. It's as though they get a KICK out of screwing people over! ""We'll only use 25% of the disc space for no logical reason."" Obviously, they're ignorant of the power of this format.This disc also contains their lame attempt at a 5.1 remix."
3,Asteroid No.4 - 'Honeyspot' (Turquoise Mountain) 3 1/2 stars,"I can hardly believe what I'm hearing on this CD from the Asteroid No.4. They're playing what {some might} consider to be neo-psychedelic country rock. Is that even a genre? Actually, they make it work for them. This entire thirteen disc just totally caught me off guard. Tracks I liked best were ""Running Away"", the semi-foot stomping ""Big City Blues', the title cut ""Honeyspot"", the familiar-sounding ""One Time"", the Byrds-like ""California"" {best song on the entire CD} and the Dylan-ish ""Trolley Car Blues"". This effort MUST'VE been majorly influenced by the late Gram Parsons {guitarist on the Byrd's 'Sweetheart Of The Rodeo album}. Not a bad thing, though."
3,Good Travel Guide,"Well researched, the book would make an excellent companion on a walking tour of London. The author knows what buildings are still standing from Gilbert and Sullivan's world, which have been demolished, and which have changed. Gives great descriptions of the theaters, including the Savoy, where the productions were staged, and so forth.If I have a criticism of the book, it is laid out geographically -- so you might be discussing Gilbert in 1876 at one minute and Arthur Sullivan in 1885 at another, because that is where the next building on the street leads you. The continuity suffers a little because of this.But if you know a Gilbert and Sullivan fan who is making a pilgrimage to London, this is the perfect book for them."
3,Dissappointed,I am bit disappointed with this collection. Something is missing but I can't pinpoint what it is. I would not recommend to buy it.
5,Outstanding and Fascinating Modern Presidency Reading,"The material has been thoroughly revised and updated to take account of developments in exproring new ideas of modern presidency. It provides a convenient and informative work of reference for those who studying the presidency and practitioners. Through this book, James P.Pfiffner has created an outstanding reading material and absolutely fascinating though on modern presidency reference."
3,Fits Pentax K-X OK,"I love the idea of this product, but in practice it's a little cumbersome. I've been using it with the new Pentax K-X for about a month and a half. I normally have the 18-55mm kit lense attached. With this combination it does fit, but it's a tight squeeze and I worry a little about putting too much force on the lens to loop the top over. It has stretched out some and I think it does its job well enough now. I'd probably go for the Op/Tech type neoprene case if I had to do it over again, although that one might have its own problems."
2,"Nice cover, but way too large for my camera","I have a Konica-Minolta DiMage Z6 and was looking for a nice neoprene cover to wrap it up so I could just put it in a backpack. There weren't any dimensions on this cover to gauge the size. It's so large, my camera just rolls around inside it, so I had to send it back. Just a thought on one thing that might improve it would be a velcro closure for extra security."
2,"Beware of a 20% ""re-stocking fee"" for returns","I recently ordered a camera case and when it came in the mail I realized it was a little bigger than I thought it was, so I contacted the company to see if there were any special instructions for returning the item (in my experience when you order something online there are almost always return instructions on the receipt with your order, but there were none). They emailed me with the address for the return and mentioned there would be a 20% re-stocking fee tagged on. While they tell me it is stated in their return policy (and I did not argue that is was), I think it is the most ridiculous idea. There are many other places I could have ordered from that would not have charged me this extra fee.....now I know and will certainly take my business elsewhere. While this particular order was a small purchase and 20% is a relatively small amount of money, I would NOT want to be charged 20% on a larger electronic purchase!"
3,"Would have been great, if it fit.","I really wanted this cover for my Nikon D5000 since I didn't want to carry a giant camera case around. However, this standard size cover is too small for my camera with the standard kit lens. The lens was about 3.5"", the problem is really with the size of the camera body. I would need the large version of this case. Conceptually, I would prefer this cover design over other soft cases but they need to provide more information on camera compatibility for this product."
3,One size doesn't fit many,"Just fits with my Canon 10D or T1i with the Canon 28-105 and a shoe horn. Problem is, my walking around lens is a Tamron 28-75 2.8 and that's just too long for the case. Tough to squeeze the camera body in even with the ""right"" lens. OK setup if you're walking around lens is a diminutive one.I would not recommend. It's too picky on lenses to be very helpful."
3,ok for limited use,I was looking for a case to protect my old Nikon F1 - This fit well but it is so awkward during use - having the lens part of the case on the bottom instead of the top means you have to remove the whole case to use it. I cant see using it in the field. It will be usefull during storage and transport.
4,Great light cover!,"I bought this cover for my Pentax k-x camera, and it works great! I wanted a camera cover for some protection of my camera, but not a big bulky camera bag. This is great for my use, I can keep my camera around my neck og over my shoulder and it's still a bit protected, or I can put it in my handbag along with all my other stuff, and don't have to feel so ""touristy"" all the time. :-)"
2,Too small for Canon XS with Lens,"I purchased this camera after looking at a couple reviews that mentioned they fit the canon slr EOS series. I had just recently purchased an Canon EOS XS camera (along with the 18-55mm kit lens) and wasnt a big fan of the backpack-type bags. I just wanted a case for my camera so I could put it inside my purse when i went places, instead of having to lug around another bag. However, this case was too small for my camera. It seemed JUST short of fitting my camera...i think if i had tried to tug it another inch or so, it might have just barely fit...but I didn't want to jam my camera in there, and I dont think that's what anybody is looking for as well. However, the quality and everything else was what i was looking for..too bad it didnt fit"
5,Good Buy For SLR Cameras,I bought the Zing 501-101 for my Canon A-1 because I don't use a camera bag much and it fits it perfectly. I also tried it on a Ricoh Singlex TLS and fits that camera perfectly too. I will definitely get another for the Ricoh too.
1,we put up with enough of this crap in school.,"I couldn't hardly stand reading it. The Author seems to think that the clinic is the place to do research. It is not, our clients or students aren't research guinea pigs.The problem with OT is the fact that there is no research to support our claims, and this is just an excuse to keep trying other things that aren't based on clinical research. For instance, Sensory Integration..........has never been proven clinically, but everyone uses it. Why not try to prove it with research,then use it?"
5,The Best Yet!,"I received my c.d. last week and have listened to it every day. Kathy Is my favorite female artist. She has the God given talent to speak to our joys and our sorrows. My favorite song off this c.d. is ""Goodbye For Now"". It really helps me to cope with my loss. I suggest everyone give Kathy a listen if they want to be renewed."
4,Great Brush --- Okay Price...,"I Love This Brush...From the soft bristles to the design. thePrice is a bit steep though...However, I'm satisfied overall."
3,"Nice brush, but...","Admittedly, a very nice brush. Unfortunately, it was packed by the seller in a box filled with cut-up paper and some rose buds. The whole thing was drenched with an artificial rose perfume so stinky you could smell it through the closed box. Opening the box made it worse. I should have taken the box outside but forgot and left in on a counter. The next morning the whole house stunk! Please, I wanted a brush, not somebody's idea of ""style""."
3,Nice brush but handle breaks.,"The brush is nice and I loved it while using it in beauty school. The handle broke on my friends within the second week and then mine broke a couple weeks after. I would use another brush with a more sturdy handle. I love my new one that has a thicker, softer brush and a very sturdy handle:)"
4,Perfect for your face but a tad overpriced,"It's surprisingly hard to find a good facial brush in stores. When you can find them, they are often poorly made or have bristles that are too harsh for your face (even for a guy). This brush by Dermalogica is soft enough for even sensitive skin but definitely ideal for daily facial cleansing (especially for those like me who have combo skin and bigger pores on and around the nose). I still think this should be under $10 but I'll not quibble."
5,Love this little brush,"Good purchase, I use this facial brush each night. It is soft and really does a thorough job. Feels great"
4,I like it,I like it. I use it every other week. That is how often i need this product. Could be more thicker.
3,Ah the irony of it all ...,The true Bush fan will love the rich and well-crafted work of James Spada. Those who do not have such respect for Mr. Bush will see only the irony that a noted and respected photographer of male nudes is the author of this book.
2,The Snow Fort,I was disappointed in The Snow Fort_The Backyardigans. I hadn't viewed it and just took a chance on it. It doesn't have all of the Backyardigans in it this time. There didn't seem to be much point to it. The content was just a thought repeated over and over again. Not on a par with the other Dvd's.
5,Backyardigans save the day,"We bought this video for our 2 year old daughter and it's one of the best video purchases we've made. We don't watch videos very much, but when we're traveling they become so important as they hold her attention. She likes Dora, but after a short time she becomes distracted. I love the Backyardigans because they seem to be singing and dancing alot and she really loves that. She pays more attention and is actually starting to sing and dance with them. For us, as parents, it's great too because the songs are actually enjoyable to hear. Much better than some of the other childrens music out there."
5,Excellent Children DVD,"My 21 month baby just love this DVD, every morning when she wakes up she literally takes me to the TV set, shows me the Backyardigans DVD just to watch it. The programs are really fun, the songs makes it so interesting. You can watch it every day and you don't get annoyed. 5 stars."
4,"""King Austin"" a hit","My 3-yr old son loves this DVD as he does all of the Backyardigans DVDs. However, he likes the ""Knights Are Brave and Strong"" episode the best and wants me to fast forward past the others to see it over and over again."
3,"OK, but not the best","Its OK, but not proficient. If you play with it to much it breaks. The smoker fluid is a little tricky. If you cut in the wrong place, it spills out like crazy. The box is delicate and breaks easily (so keep it away from children under 9!) And when I herd it had sound, I bought it and got a huge surprise. It didn't make the whistle sound, it just went chg chg chg. And my biggest complainant is the connecters. The first few go one fine, but after that my Mom or Dad are doing it for me. It would be better if you screwed it on a table. But on the bright side it dose go its average speed, and stays on the track well.-SETH, 10"
4,nikon adapter,"HiI ordered this product because I lost the one that came with the camera.While it works well, it is a bit inconvenient. Lots of part.Would I recommend it, absolutely. It works, and that's what I wanted.I hope this helps someone."
2,Not what I wanted,I thought this had the battery charger included and it did not. It really is useless to me. Can't make it work with the camera I have even though it said this was the one for my camera
4,Wordy,"I thought the story was very interesting. However, he went into such detail that the story gets bogged down and is tedious to read. I persevered however and ended up enjoying the story."
4,Don't Miss This Incredible Story!,"Prepare to be amazed. I was pretty hard on Mr. Koontz's last book, but this one floored me. The storyline at first seems to be another ""aliens take over earth"" story, but as it progresses to its incredible conclusion, it turns into a truly awesome novel. I am not religious or into metaphysics, but was still able to appreciate the idea he is putting across in this book. You will not a read another book that will affect you like this story's ending does. What a concept!!!! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the flowery prose was a little too overwhelming. Otherwise, it's perfect.READ THIS BOOK!"
3,Creepy Koontz,"The Taking begins with an environmental apocalypse, torrential rains soak the world, drowning and isolating billions. This is revealed to be the first wave of a full scale invasion of Lovecraftian horrors.Akin to Stephen King's ""The Mist"" and other ""lifeboat"" horror stories, The Taking is centered around one location \with a fixed cast. Unlike many of his recent novels Dean invokes creepy atmosphere with interesting characters. The descriptions of the forest's mutation and the weird new life that is spawned are the highlights of the book."
1,Reads Like a Bad Movie,"I also really like Dean Koontz's books, but this one reads like a bad B movie. I swear the scenes were written so they could be made into a visual movie to shock the audience. Events didn't tie together well, and the ending was a let down. If you are a fan check this one out at the library."
3,Pretty good. Similar to Phantoms.,"This reminded me of Phantoms, my favorite Dean Koontz novel.The Taking is less graphic and violent but is very imaginative and descriptive. This is one of the better of Dean Koontz's books. I also didn't find many of his books to be any good, so that is saying a lot about The Taking.The Taking's plot is somewhat basic but it plays out like an epic X-Files Episode."
3,It was okay.,I enjoyed reading this book just because it kept me busy. It was just okay. Dean Koont's has deffinately written better. 3 stars. =(
3,Disappointed in the ending...,"I am a Dean Koontz fan and have read about dozen or so of his books. As the story unfolded, I could not put the book down. It grabbed me (like they usually do) and I felt a compassion toward Molly and Neil and their quest. The book had my undivided attention.That is, until everything came to a screeching halt as the story was wrapping up. It was too neat to wrap the whole thing up in, what, about five pages? I'm all for happy endings, but this ending felt rushed and now I feel cheated."
1,Religious Crap,"If I wanted to read about God destroying the world and starting over, I'd consult a bible - not Dean Koontz. Enough with the religious stuff already."
2,Dean Koontz's worst book.,"Okay this has to be one of the worst books I've read by DK. The charachters were really shallow, the plot was ridiculous and the alien spores? Come on. It was a great disappointment...I wouldn't have expected this from the ""master"" of all horror!"
4,Stop Being Obtuse,I'm surprised people didn't get the POINT of this story.It was frightening and it made its point.
1,Pretentious Junk,"This is the worst novel I have read (almost completed) in ages, let alone the worst by Koontz. The worst of it is that Koontz keeps quoting T.S. Eliot, perhaps in an attempt to impress and lift his overwritten drivel into the realms of what is so loosely termed 'literary fiction'. At least I got a laugh out of the purple prose, but the unacknowledged 'borrowings' from Eliot angered me. The book is plotless, themeless, without anything near real characterization, all couched in overblown language - in short, worthless, even if you wait for the paperback."
1,Skip at all costs,The Mist meets the Dreamcatcher meets the Stand meets the Theasarua meets the Bibile...but in the worst way...pretentious junk... Just leave it
4,Not Nearly As Bad As Everyone Seems To Think. . .,"I read this book in a day (it's a fairly easy read) and upon finishing was left with a feeling of satisfaction. I'm confused as to why this book has gotten so many bad reviews.The book has a very good message behind it, one that I think more readers should take to heart.To those becrying 'religion' and 'politics', well, an author has the right to express his own ideas through the literature he creates. I think that some people might be angry because the book's subject really strikes a chord within them, because they realize that if THEY were in this setting, they'd be among the 'walking dead'.The only reason I gave this book four stars and not five is this: It's a bit too short. I think that Koontz could have expanded a bit more than he did. It's still a very interesting and compelling read, but like I said, I read it in a day."
2,Not my favorite from Koontz..,"I love Koontz but this book fell far from the mark. It started off slow and I found myself thinking, ""Where is this going?"" And, in the end, I felt it took me nowhere. And, the T.S. Elliott quotes got a little annoying. If you're a fan like me, I know you'll read it despite this review but if you're a first-time Koontz reader, don't start with this book. It is definitely not his best work - try Odd Thomas or even (going way back here) The Funhouse instead!"
2,Disappointing,"If you like science fiction then you might think this book is okay. I found it in the mystery section, not where it should be though. The plot is so far fetched that I had trouble finding anything to hold on to to keep my attention."
2,Disappointing!!!!,"I have so many problems with this book. There is absolutely NO character development, from beginning to end. I did not care what happened to the main character at all, because Koontz did not give me a reason to care. There was no closure at the end of the book. It was almost like he didn't know what to do with the story once he got to a certain point so he just ended it. There were definitely some creepy moments where I had to keep reading or I wouldn't be able to sleep, but that's the only good thing I can say. I threw the book across the room when I was done with it in disgust. Very very disappointed!!!"
1,The Taking,"I have been reading Dean Koontz for years. In the beginning his books were real page turners. The Taking is a real disappointment. It never really takes off. It's as if Mr. Koontz is just trying to fill up the pages with words and more words. I hope he can find the formula he used for books like ""Strangers"", ""Watchers"" and ""Intensity"", more substance and less words."
3,poof!!,"As I read this entertaining book, I could not help of thinkingthat Koontz borrowed a bit from one of my favorite short stories,Steven King's "" The Mist."" People trapped in a super market byother world creatures.Be that as it may, my disappointment went quite a bit further.It seems to me that Koontz didn't quiet know how to end it.The alien craft sailed away saving what was left of civilizationbut the millions of dead bodies magically disappeared also!!"
1,What was he thinking?,"Having read all of Koontz's work...even under his pseudonyms...and enjoyed most, his work is trickling away from that which made his work such enjoyable reading. This story was soooo dark (probably his point, with the religious overtones that come to light at the end). I too miss the days of Strangers, Watchers...I want better characters and less illiterations. They distract from the story. I will be hard pressed to continue buying Koontz books unless his style changes."
1,Warning!,"I have enjoyed Koontz' work in the past, but this one novel finished him for me. Just as you can get a ""Warning - Sexually Explicit Content"" advisory before you enter a porn web site, I feel that books that wrap all the loose ends up in the last ten pages with a goofy, pseudo-christian ""Rapture"" event should have some kind of warning on the cover. I'll ignore the ""Wouldn't you Hollywood people just LOVE to make a film out of this?"" kind of cinemagraphic staging of each horror scene in each chapter and get to my basic gripe: I would have been much more pleased and much more intellectually challenged by an ending that stated ""And then I woke up and was I REALLY, REALLY glad that it was all a bad dream!!"""
4,Great End of the World Story,"SiFi and Horror at it's best! The only book that combined these to elements better was Koontz's Midnight. The Taking really does a great job of setting the mood from page one. Then just like any other Koontz book, it takes off within two chapters. I have to disagree with some of the other reviews that say that the book tends to lag towards the middle and end. I felt the story kept a very good pace through out the entire book.Now to the ending. I felt it was a great ending. Koontz raps it up pretty well without holding your hand and blatantly spelling it out for you. Some my have wanted a more climatic ending. You know one that was more like Custer's last stand. But it wasn't needed and ended just right.If you are a Koontz, SiFi, Horror fan or just love End Of The World type of stories than this is a must read!"
3,Had to Speed Read to Get Through the Book,"One of the first things I noticed about this book (and I suppose technically, it would be the ""author"") is that too much time was spent on the author's obviously extended vocabulary. I read a lot of books for enjoyment and frankly got tired of trying to figure out where he was going with the many descriptive words which could have easily been simplified to make this book more readable. At times, especially when I was tired and just wanting to relax, I felt like I was reading poetry and had to re-read a paragraph just to get what the author was trying to say. The story itself was interesting enough but it did seem like it just dropped off at the end without explanation."
2,"Should be called ""The Boring""","This book was so slow I couldn't bear to finish it. I had the audio version and didn't even finish the first disk, it was so slow. Koontz takes a chapter from 19th century writers in spending so much time in description without anything happening. I didn't want to invest my time into hearing Koontz attempt to talk about sex from a woman's perspective....ewwwww.""Odd Thomas"" is an infinitely better book, and I would encourage you to read that one. I'm surprised that both of these books came from the same writer."
1,STOP WITH THE ADJECTIVES DEAN!!!,"I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years, but I stopped reading his new novels about 6 years ago, because after awhile, it seemed as if all of his characters were the same. I recently read the back cover of this book, and it sounded so interesting, so I gave it a chance. Boy, was I sorry. It is as if Dean Koontz regressed to a first year creative writing student! His sentences are awkward, mostly out of an insane desire to use as many adjectives and adverbs as he can - it is as if he wrote the book with a thesaurus by his side. This was way too distracting, and it really diminished what otherwise could have been an entertaining tale.Please Dean, take an opportunity to read some 'how-to' books on writing!"
1,Koontz the Reactionary Nutcase is back,"After Odd Thomas (a MUCH better book than this), I rather hoped that Koontz had recovered from his weird affinity for the lunatic fringe of the Far Right, but this badly written tome finds him right smack in the middle of it again. When the Barbie-and-Ken newscasters try to get the Noble Scientists to blame the weird weather happenings on Global Warming and the Noble Scientists try -again- to explain that Global Warming is a myth, you KNOW you're in for a brainless diatribe. This whole book seemed to be a vehicle for Koontz to imply that our corrupt culture is dooming us all to hell. St. John's Wort, Dean. Take it every day.I can't believe I read the whole thing, and I'm glad I checked it out of the library rather than spend actual personal funds to buy it. Now if I could just bill somebody to get those lost hours back..."
1,What Happened to Koontz?,"I was a huge Koontz fan in the 90's and possibly even the beginning of 2000. Something happened however. One after another I feel like he's been underwhelming. The Taking might be the worst Koontz book I've ever read. It just has no point. It ends before it starts and suddenly the mayhem he has taken the entire book to create is fixed, pretty much. It's not compelling, not engaging... I wanted to put it down half way through but I RARELY don't finish a book.The Taking was a big mis-step for Koontz. I followed this up with Velocity which was underwhelming as well - largely forgettable, though definitly not as bad as this one."
2,What a disappointment,"I think I can safely say I have read all of Koontz's books. If you are also a fan, do not buy this book! ""Diarreha of the word processor"" hit the nail on the head. What started out as a decent read with plenty of suspense soon turned into blah blah blah blah blah! I started reading one or two sentences a page just to get through it.Mr. Koontz, you are so much better than this."
3,This ranks as the worst book I have read all year,"I usually try to cut an author some slack especially this Author because I like most of his other stuff(Odd Thomas, Tick Tock and Sole Survivor just to name a few)but this book is not fit for use as toilet paper. I'm sorry but never has a book by this author moved so ponderously and slowly almost without purpose. This should not surprise me considering the plot type had been done a million times before. To be fair I did not read the whole book I just managed to get about half-way but nothing was happening, nor were the characters doing anything by the halfway point I just gave up.Overall-Having just finished Odd Thomas I have to say that the contrast between the two is extraordinary if you are a Dean Koontz fan looking for a good time give Odd Thomas a spin and leave this one on the bargain rack where it belongs."
1,DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE MP3,"The book is awesome, but the download from audible sucks. I downloaded it and tried to burn it, but it didn't burn right. When I tried again, it told me I could only burn it once and wouldn't let me try again. Do not purchase anything from Audible."
4,Scary Eater of Souls!,"Dean Koontz terrific latest effort 'The Taking' is scary, very scary. I'm an Anne Rice, James Patterson kinda guy, because i like my fantasies and thrillers done right. When i want to get my pants scared off i go to one of the masters, Mr. Koontz! Perhaps this book did suck and i have an incredibly vivid imagination in order to say that this book is really good. No. This book didnt suck. Its excellent. Take the scene where the Couple is walking down the street with children and dog in toe, and she sees some red scaley tail hanging from the trees above. Full well knowing that if the slow down, stop walking, or do anything otherwise that whatever is up in the trees will come down and ivicerate them. Now that is scary!!! Its an easy read, pick up, you'll enjoy getting spooked, dont analyz it. god my spelling is horrible, but my judgement is right on!!!!!!"
1,"Not a ""Classic"" - By a longshot!","The book started with a lot of promise, but by the end, I was skimming to get it over with. The characters were unrealistic and the gender-role-reversal of the main couple (SHE obviously has the external gonads in the family) was painfully realized. The book read like a alien/horror romance novel, with long, drawn-out periods of drippy introspection that made me angry, it was so insipid. Comparisons to real classics in science fiction are laughable. First and last book I will read by this author."
3,"Not great book, Lousy audio book!","This book was long. Long and not very interesting. It started slowly, and built up to mildly suspenseful, but never got anywhere.The worst thing to me, was that I listened to this book on CD, and I really couldn't get into it because the woman reading it, (Meyers) was so awful. I wasn't crazy about her female voice, which grated on my nerves, but what a lousy job she did on the male voices! She did them all in the same gravelly silly kind of deeper version of her own voice, which annoyed me so much that I found myself tuning out & missing parts of the story, rather than listen to her feeble attempts at male voices. Maybe I caould have enjoyed the story more if I had read it, rather than listened to it."
3,"Not His Best, But Still Koontz","Not the best Koontz I've read, but if you are a loyal fan, you will read it and find it enjoyable. I couldn't just put down the book because there were some flaws. Also, you find some genuine ""creepy"" moments - that took me back to ""Dark Fall"" (his book it took me a while to read because it just got too scary and I had to put it down several times. Overall its an averagely entertaining read."
3,Great beginning.........Poor Ending,"This was one of those books that started out fantastic and then slowly went downhill from there. The first few chapters of this book are awesome. You are constantly wanting to read more and it will keep you up at night. However, the book slowly started to turn weird and then suddenly it was over leaving me a little disappointed."
4,Overall very enjoyable,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book...and, despite what others may think, I am not ""paid by Koontz"" and I have read many other agreed-upon quality books. I genuinely enjoyed this one.From the beginning, the book had me hooked...he jumps into the story, into the suspense, so quickly. I, like another reviewer, could never figure out how in the world the characters could even hope for a happy ending.My only complaints would be that yes, his metaphors sometimes were overdone, and the abrupt transition in the story to give the main characters the purpose of saving the children was disturbing for a long time; it seemed contrived at first, like he just all of a sudden decided they needed a mission, but was finally explained.I loved the ending...and I won't give it away. It was somewhat predictable, but that's ok...a good deal of our entertainment these days is predictable; I personally enjoy seeing how the author/director/etc will play out that ending.Just a good, fun read!"
2,errr....,"I have read some Kootnz books and this one seems no different. ""The Taking"" is bland and will not stick out in my memory of books to remember.My beef on Kootnz himself is that is one, WAY TOO obsessed with dogs. Does he own like 20 or something and each has to be the star in his book? In all his books he has the dogs be some kind of special, powerful, force of good. Not that that's not true :) but it can be really annoying.The other thing that is a repetive theme is his obsession with horrible pasts. If you have read ""One door away from heaven"", your know what I mean.I did give it 2 stars because there were times that I was kinda scared. However, the plot lacked any real creativness and it was too short for the problems that it presented. Also the ending was really dumb. The ""aliens"" just magically disapear because Molly stood them up. Who let him publish this? Don't waste your time on this book, but if you must reading it an audiobook would probably be more interesting."
1,"An Editor, Please!","How can one of the most skilled writers in the world suddenly publish such garbage? I've been reading Koontz for years, and never been more disappointed than I was about halfway through ""The Taking"". Koontz abandoned storytelling for trying to impress us with how wordy he can be and how many big and unusual words he has in his vocabulary. You want to impress people with how smart you are, take up teaching or something, Koontz. But if you intend to keep an audience for your novels, you'd be wise to get back to the basics and tell the doggone story. People accuse King of being wordy, but at least he knows how to tell a story, even if he does publish thousand-pagers.Basic sentences, Koontz. Basic vocabulary. Please get back to that or start a new carreer in writing crossword puzzles.Save your money, folks. Save your money. But if you must read it, get it from the library, or take my copy from the landfill."
1,A mess.,"This book started okay and then went way downhill. I couldn't wait to finish it so I could move on to something else. I would skip paragraphs of useless explanations and just read the dialouge. Creatures with faces on their hands and evil fungi?? What the F*#k? The characters were boring and one dimensional. The Dogs and her evil father...all done to death by Koontz. After reading The Face, Odd Thomas, and Dark Rivers of the Heart in the last few months I was looking forward to this. All of those were great, this was not."
1,where did the old Dean Koontz go?,"I have read all of Koontz's books and I anxiously awaited this book and after reading it, I knew the wait wasn't worth it. I had just read Odd Thomas and so hoped this new book would be better. Alas it wasn't. Where of where did our Dean Koontz of Dark Rivers of the Heart and Watchers and Dragon Tears, etc.go? He would so carfully craft a story and draw you into it so deep that you couldn't wait to finish it but you didn't want it to end. This book was so formulaic that you really didn't have to finish it to know what was going to happen. In his early books, every word he typed seemed important to the story. In this book, you have page after page of almost nothing but adjectives. I want my old Koontz back. This book was not worth the read."
2,NOT his best effort..........to say the least.,"Let me preface this by saying that I LOVE Dean Koontz. Realistically, I've probably put his kids thru college or at least added a room onto his house with all the money I've spent on his books in the past. But this one..........WHEW!!!! It really threw me for a loop. Without going too far into it and boring you: If you're expecting ""Odd Thomas"", ""Tick Tock"", ""The Hideaway"" or any other Koontzesque favorites, you'll be HIGHLY disappointed.It's well written as are most of his books, but it's about an alien invasion with really no unexpected twists. I think we all love his books for those twists or really wacky things that happen. But none of it is here. Zero.If you're in the mood for an alien invasion book, read the ""War of the Worlds"". I've never read it, but it HAS to be better then this. Sorry Dean..........I still love ya."
2,Is it LUMINOUS?!,"How many times can the word, luminous (and its variations - luminosity, luminescence, etc.), be used in one book? Hundreds. Dean Koontz has written many books I've enjoyed but this one is just awful. The plot does not thicken until the novel is nearly finished and by then, who cares. What Koontz often does well is develop good dog characters. He misses the mark this time and the humans are not much to brag about either. The ending is ridiculous. I could almost see the author sitting at his desk scratching his head wondering how to stop writing. He should have stopped around Page 1."
4,Ambitious Concept--Great Delivery!,"Without giving away any element of the book's suspense, I must say that the denouement of THE TAKING was truly thought-provoking. Only Koontz could give such an imaginative, yet philosophical, spin to the concepts of heaven and hell and their relationships to the space/time continuum. Those readers who feel that Koontz is a Stephen King mimic give too much credit to the latter author. Koontz is, always has been, and always will be in a class by himself. THE TAKING gets another thumbs up for this prolific storyteller."
2,Is this a joke?,"I can't believe how bad this novel is. Koontz does everything a bad writer does - from poor character development to cornball horror to pages of explanation when the plot can't suffice to create a story. There's none of Koontz' trademark dialogue, no building of tension. Just a boring series of stereotyped situations and characters.This must have been a writer's inside joke. Or maybe he just wanted to see how many critics would call it a ""tour de force"". It doesn't show much respect for his reading audience, however. I just had a hysterectomy and chose this dependable author to take my mind off my early recovery. Can't trust him any longer, however. From now on, I'm reading reviews before I buy anything by Koontz."
2,Hummmm Bug,The end of this book with all its mysteries RUINED this book for me.But no hard feelings. I still love you very much Mr Koontz.Forever Sir.
4,Excellent building of mystery and suspense; unsatisfying payoff,"This book really had me turning page after page for the first 2/3; especially the first half or so. But the final third of the book, in which the mystery is ""explained"" (sort of) is not very satisfying. I love Koontz's books, but his ideological ax-grinding is getting a little too predictable."
2,Boring!!!,"After Odd Thomas and The Face I was really looking forward to reading The Taking. Man, was I disappointed. It was so boring, I would skip whole pages just so I could get to the end. Mr. Koontz must have been in a drugged state to think that this book was anything up to his usual standards. I have always enjoyed his books and will continue to read them unless the next one is like this one and then, I""m afraid, I'll have to pass him by. It seems like he has gone the way of Stephen King in the last years when Mr. King's books got way too weird and boring."
1,BAH!,I have read almost all Koontz's books. I expected so much more. Way too much religious crap thrown in at the end. Very dissappointing! Glad I got this at the Goodwill for only a buck!
2,Read something else by Koontz,"I also loved many Koontz books, years ago. I recently bought a mix of his earlier works for my nephew to read. This one was a huge disappointment.The events in this work are so mystifying that even the characters ask each other what the heck is going on. They look at each other and say, ""why would this happen? why would they do this?"" but we are NEVER told. Many, many weird things happen that are NEVER explained.The final, strange explanation (thought up by a character; we don't even know if she is right) still doesn't explain most of what happened. I love science fiction; this was just weird, confusing, dismal narrative. I was really trying to keep an open mind even to the very end. Just not worth the trip."
3,About the ending...,"Many people have complained that they hated the way Dean Koontz ended this book, considering it to have been disappointing and weak. Perhaps these reviewers would have preferred an alien invasion, but in my opinion, that would have been the weaker ending.People who believe in a Biblical worldview know that Lucifer, also known as Satan, is actually real and working his evil deeds on earth. We should be far more concerned about him than about beings from other planets. He will not win, in the end, but he has been given a certain amount of freedom at the present time.I appreciate that Dean Koontz, in his books, wants to present evil as it really is. In too many books, the ""bad"" person is handsome or charming or in some way attractive, so that you want to like him or her in spite of yourself. But Mr. Koontz presents evil as being the ugly, unpleasant, destructive force that it really is. That comes through loud and clear in The Taking."
1,How did this become a top ten?,"In the beginning I enjoyed Koontz books, but he became predictable and boring. This book took all my effort to even get to the end. The characters were boring and I didn't care what happened to them. It seemed he just repeated the same things over and over. What a disappointment."
1,My first and last visit with Koontz,"Bloated writing style that seems less descriptive than self serving, I found myself yelling ""enough already, let's move on!!"" His ascension to soapbox preachiness, about the media, etc, is transparent and superficial. And its not enough that he writes a story that has roots from Noah to Close Encounters, he must tell us explicitly lest his poor readers miss the connection. Yuck!! Come to think of it, one star is too much!!!!"
2,Too wordy,"I found this story to be far too wordy. I skipped past many paragraphs just to get back to the actual story. It felt like he was just trying to fill up the page by dragging out each event, and going off on bunny trails. The end was not satisfying and seemed thrown together."
2,What the Frak???,"Alright...Let me start I like most Dean Koontz books. I mean they are usually fun and easy to blaze through. However, everything I love about most of his books, seems to be lacking. Where I think Koontz usually does a first rate job and giving us characters the reader cares about, here they are just caricatures. There is no substance that makes feel a connection to Molly and Neil. Additionally, it nevers feels that these two are ever truly in danger. Sure they run into trouble, but never does it feel as if true harm will come to them. In the end the main problem is that this reads more like a Hollywood action movie, than a novel."
1,Worst Book EVER?,"This is probably one of the worst books I've ever read in general, not just the worst Dean Koontz book I've ever read. The only reason I finished it is because I don't like to waste money. I threw it directly into the trash when I was finished because I wouldn't wish it on anyone else.I don't even want to explain the story, because I'll feel like an idiot typing out the synopsis, but suffice it to say that there are many other reviewers who feel the same way I do. This was a horrible story and a horrible book. The typical Dean Koontz way of having 18 descriptive words before a noun got especially tiring in this book. ""The silverish golden coppery red bluish luminescent lightish wavering wiggly horrifying chitenous...""Ugh."
1,"Bad Beginning, Horibble Middle, Dreadful Ending","""The Taking"" was a complete waste of time. The beginning was dull and tiresome to read. Molly and Neil are boring as individual characters and they have no chemistry as a couple. There was no point in bringing Michael Render in the book either. He brought no excitement, no twist to the story. Render was a waste of 10 pages of reading time.I had to read the first chapter over and over just to get a jump start on the story. It did not draw me into the book and make me crave for more. It actually did the opposite. I wanted to stop reading it, but I decided to give it a chance. I figured once I got to the middle, the story would take off, but it never did. The only reason why I read it to the end was because I thought Koontz might have a twist or something at the end that would tie the whole book together, but he didn't.Total disappointment."
1,Snooze Fest...Total Yawner,This is the first Dean Koontz book I ever tried to read...and it may be my last. The book did absolutely nothing to hold my attention (this is a #1 New York Times Best Selling Author???). I had to force myself to read the first few chapters before I couldn't stand it anymore. Total waste of time.
3,Ok. Interesting concept but lacking depth,First third had awesome description though it was not complete; rest of the book was fascinating but needed more development. It could have contained a complete reconstruction of the world like The Stand; a new heaven and a new earth? The taking was a good read but I won't buy anymore kindle copies of this author's books as I can buy paper back copies used for $2. $9.99 is too much to pay. This novel felt like an outline for a more developed book with fuller characters which could have been a classic.....actually the last odd Thomas novel had the same feel. Maybe this author should stop aiming for quantity and again reclaim the quality of earlier novels?
1,"""The Taking of the Reader's Money""","I used to count on this author for quick entertaining thrillers, but enough is enough. This book is all about a fast, easy paycheck for the Koontz franchise (coming soon, Dean Koontz's Hamlet!). ""It was a dark and stormy night"" summarizes the setting, and of course we get the usual psychic household pets and sensitive, enlightened beautiful people. Various descriptions seem lifted verbatim from his earlier novels. (He's used the word ""sussurant"" before, but not twice in the same book; I'm convinced the dog ate his thesaurus.) The whole thing feels as if the writing was outsourced to third-world peasants who were given Koontz's earlier novels as a guide. If you've just gotta have a Koontz fix, buy the recently re-released Icebound instead (written maybe 20 years ago and a departure for him, no things-that-go-bump-in-the-night, but a fairly entertaining yarn.)"
1,Worst ever,I've read everything that Dean Koontz has written. I expected more from this book and didn't get it. It started to build into something that could have been good but it let me down. Certainly not his best work. Won't stop me from reading his new books but you could probably let this one slide.
1,Sucked!,"Dean Koontz is my favorite author--I usually love his books. This one reminded me of the lazy author's way of making a quick buck based on his name without working for it. If this book had been a movie, it would have been one of those cheap B Flicks in the genre of ""Night of the Living Dead."" That's about all the plot this book had. This book was actually a combination of a couple of his other books with different characters & not as much imagination. My favorite book Koontz ever wrote was Midnight. I was totally engrossed in that story & concerned for the characters. Also, his Christopher Snow books. I wish he'd go back to that kind of great writing."
4,A Surprise!,"Expecting Koontz's usual excellent horror story, I was pleasantly surprised to find that his story of aliens was not exactly what I began to believe while starting the story. By the end of the book, I was surprised and pleased to discover spiritual truths and hope. What a wonderful surprise! - Cynthia Hickey, author of Pursued By Evil"
4,"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio . . .","I have been a Koontz fan for many years, and I am becoming more and more so. In this book (as well as in his last few) there were no jars of eyeballs, no trophy body parts, no single madman out to terrorize the population. There WERE themes of good versus evil and the natural versus the supernatural, and I suppose that's why some people were disappointed in the ending.What this book does offer is suspense, a wonderful job of a male writing writing in a female POV, vivid and imaginative writing, and a theme far wider than society versus a single psychopath. Congratulations, Mr. Koontz. You are growing wiser, and I will keep reading your work!"
3,Far from Koontz's best,"Dean Koontz has become one of my favorite writers in recent years. I enjoy the good, sympathetic heroes , the well-plotted stories, and the sense of humor found in all of his novels. I expected to really enjoy ""The Taking"", but somehow I did not. I don't know why I couldn't get into this book. It had all the features of a good Koontz novel, but somehow the parts did not come together for me. Maybe it was the deus ex machina ending in which the Aliens are revealed to be the Devil and his angels, here to sift the population of the Earth for Hell. Maybe, it was because The Taking was more a horror story than Koontz usual suspense stories. While reading The Taking, I did sometimes feel as if I were in a nightmare.In sum, the Taking is good, especially at the beginning, but it could have been so much better."
1,A total WASTE of time even if you have lots of time at hand,"This book is supposed to depict alien invasions and how a small band of people surrived the attack. But Koontz is so weak in his descriptions that you can never get to the bottom and share the terror felt by the lead characters. His aliens are so evasive that when you finish the book, you still cannot tell what they want from the attack. Koontz was once a good writer. What's wrong with him? Is he that desperate for money and have to churn out books like this? If you relly want to read books with theme like this, read Stephen King's The Stand. And will understand what I mean by a masterpiece."
3,Interesting Little Surprise,"I didn't see the end coming, though the clues were there. I found myself pushing through the prose because I just...wanted...to...finish...it. Hand it to the man, the resolution makes sense, though twenty pages from the end you're reading only to find out how he's going to pull it off.If you're a David Gerrold/War Against the Chtorr fan, by the way, you can close your eyes and imagine that this is the long-awaited fifth novel in that series."
3,The Taking,"Better than some of his ""new"" stuff, but not up to the standard of his better novels. The GOOD NEWS is that the plot is interesting and reminds us of the time when Dean Koontz really wrote good horror/ suspense novels. The BAD NEWS is the lack of character development and the lack of scope for the entire novel. It is in a lot of ways an expanded short story. And whodesigned the cover? (hardback) It has nothing to do with the book."
2,?????,"I am a devoted fan but this book confused me. I was intrigued through the entire book until the end. I may have missed it but what made the main character so special ? What power did she have to survive ""the end of the world"" I thought the old Koontz was back but I think I liked Odd Thomas a whole lot better."
2,Somebody is running short for ideas...,"On the one hand, I LOVE Koontz. On the Other there is THIS book.He starts off well, more or less. He builds tension and such, but... The mains in this one are so one dimension and ""Duddly DoRightish"" that by chapter four I was rooting for the ""Aliens"".Add to that a confusing, at times, narrative and an ending that is not only weak but fairly simple to figure out halfway through... (The attack on the space station was the high point. After that things go downhill into moralizing and predictability)Only get this one if you are a Koontz fan who wants to have his complete works. Other than that read Stephen King whilst dressed like an arc angel, you'll get the same affect.B Goetz"
4,Great Book - Ok Ending - Definitely On My Favorites List,"All in all this was a pretty awesome book, I loved the story line and it was just well... awesome. I am not going to bother with requoting the summary as it has been said many times, it will grip you and you will not want to put it down, but.. towards the end there were not that many pages left.. I was wondering how he was going to end it.. well i was a little disappointed but that is ok, the rest of the book was awesome, go Koontz!"
4,The Taking is Suspensful~ created by: Natalie H.,"The taking is about a woman named Molly, who is married with no children. It is about the end of the world. Different things happen in the book, wierd things. Some of these obsticles that Molly and her husband incounter are things or people that are not alive but are moving and talking. Several different ""things"" such as spaceships, giant bugs, or unknown beings, are killing people. Molly, her husband, and a dog become an alliance and linger around their small community in search for alive children to protect. I think that this book is great because of the suspence. Some suspensful moments are when Molly goes up stairs of her neighbors house when she runs across her neighbor which had blew out his brains when she hears someting on the roof that just fell into the attic. It made me want to read on and find out what would happen to Molly, and I hope it will for the future readers of ""The Taking"""
3,Not bad not good,"But I can understand the one-star reviews: That preaching narrative was quite bad. But this is a little horror feast [up to the very end] If you have time, give a try. You might like it."
4,Good stuff,"For years, I have considered reading Koontz novels a guilty pleasure, but this one was amazing. It was richer than his previous works and was filled with more hope. In a lot of ways, it reminded me of ""Twilight Eyes"", which was also about redemption and a kind of end to the world. The spiritual turn to the book really rang true to my own beliefs. The mainstays of kootzian fiction were present; writers, dogs, California, but it was more substantial and earnest. Very good read!"
1,"Oh, what a waste of time!","I love world-end books...but as far as I can see, Mr. Koontz is not the one capable of writing a world-end story. The book tries to be a unique mixture of world-end books and movies but falls flat on full face. And the ending, with strong echoes of Left Behind series and the Stand, is one of the cheapset ends I have read in my whole life. Skip this stinking trick and re-read the Stand or watch the War of the Worlds again. And Mr Koontz, you'd better stick with your infinite horde of golden retrievers, labradors or whatsoever and your psychopaths--at least you were capable of bringing a REAL END to those stories...A shame on publishing world!"
1,Skip this,"so you can save your time and money. A terrible book from a mediocre writer. All that religious/ political/ hope-springs-ethernal hodgepodge doesn't help it. Yes, I know I don't expect a Steinbeck/ Tolstoy/ Bradbury/ King style writing but hell I only wanted a pleasent read. Unfortunately there is none except silly cardboard characters and extremely screwed-up sentences. Pity for trees and souls like me who bought this dump thing."
1,love dean koontz but no this one,sorry to say but i was very disappointed with this book. I probably read the first couple of chapters and i was done. Little green aliens is not my style.
1,This is the Work of a Best Selling Author?,"This is the first Koontz book I've read. It will be the last. His plotting is ill-concieved and simplistic...not to mention terribly ethnocentric. His conception of characterization relies wholey on hyperbole and repetition. Making matters worse is Koontz's insistence on creating heroes whose only qualifying characteristics are that they are not pathetically stupid and are sickeningly consistent in their lack of depth. His method of exposition assumes stupidity on the part of his readers...then, as if to apologize for his arrogance, Koontz juggles in as much obscure vocabulary as he can manage. One gets the impression of a writer struggling to be seen as a good writer rather than actually becoming one.The story is a throw-away knock-off of the Left Behind books, and deserves to be forgotten as quickly as possible.What I wonder is this: Why has Koontz become a successful writer in spite of being so bad at it?"
2,Don't Waste Your Time or Money!,"I'm a long time Dean Koontz fan, but I did not like ""The Taking"". There was way too much narration and not enough dialogue between the characters. Characterization was weak, leaving you with the feeling that you didn't really know these people.There were plenty of scary moments, but they all fell flat. If Koontz had taken time with his characters like Stephen King did in The Stand and Salem's Lot, or the way Koontz himself did with Twilight Eyes and Watchers, he would've produced a very effective novel.The ending was a confusing mix of the book of Revelation and War of the Worlds. Considering the number of successes he has under his belt, I guess even an author as talented as Koontz is going to bomb out every now and then."
4,Riveting,I'm a big Dean Koontz fan. This book is typical Dean Koontz with it's twists and turns. Lot's of things going on in the story to keep the readerglued to the book.
4,Not that bad........,"After reading the book, I don't feel it was as bad as the other readers claimed. From the first chapter I was hooked into what this evil was. Some parts were confusing and not fully explained but overall I'd give it a three and a half."
5,Great Book!,"It astounds me just people -who are supposed to be passionate readers- lack comprehension or don't seem to get this book.They are so very hung up on the entities being called ""ETs"" by the characters in the book and the cliched horror scenarios that they fail to get the point. The last few pages are explicable and satisfactory to anyone with at least an average intelligence.Great novel. It kept me turning pages disregarding sleep."
2,Not So Easy to Read,"This is my first book by this author. At first I find the story intriging, but as the pages went by, I was getting quite irritated by the digressing manner the story began drifting back and forth from present to the past. Then there were the descriptive physiological substories within the main stories. Anyway, I got a bored halfway through the book."
1,"This book wanted me to ""Hideaway""","Sorry Mr. Koonz, but I'll take my religious lessons somewhere else besides a so called thriller novel. Great beginning as well as some scary moments but far too preachy for me. I'll be sure to read the reviews a little more carefully on future Koonz novels before purchasing."
1,What Happened?,"I used to be a big Koontz fan. What has happened? What happened to that ""it almost could happen"" intensity of, well, Intensity? Or The Watchers? Did Koontz write this book with a thesaurus on his lap? I'll probably still buy his next book, but he has definitely fallen out of favor with me."
2,A real sub-par Koontz,"Geez, lots of pretty words and not a story to tell. Koontz chose to dazzle the reader with his mastery of the english language but forgot to add a suspenseful story behind it.I found that by the middle of the book I kept checking to see how many pages were left. Not because I dreaded the book being complete but because I couldn't wait until I was through with it. I kept waiting for the story to improve but it just never did.If you choose this as your first Koontz read it may very well be your last. I would avoid this one!"
1,Ugh,"Please, guys doooon't quarrel over this chicken. It is not worthy. It is the first Koontz that I read; I read it after I saw some interesting Amazon reader reviews on it; and I highly regret that I didn't take into account the one-star ones. The ones attaching four or five stars should be simply acting with their hearts in it, not with their minds.The book is simply bad and falls flat on its face. The prose is the most terrible thing about it...add the preaching, almost lecturing narrative that goes nowhere, it is sure to give migraines anyone with a sense of taste in reading. And if this is really improved and polished Koontz over the years then thank you I would leave the other ones in the dust bin as well.Give a wide berth to this pointless thing passing as a novel.A quick note: I have read two King books (Bag of Bones and Dreamcatcher) and he seems to be far superior to Koontz. Should be no comparison there but of course Koontz experts should know better than me."
1,A Sad Waste of A Day,"I must say, that I do like Koontz immensely. I found ""Odd Thomas"" to be quite good, as well as many of his other books. However, ""The Taking"" was just not for me.I recommend that you do not waste your time on this book. I dont want to begrudge anyone in terms of fulfilling their curiosities, but please dont even try here.The subject matter was confused, as well as the characters. The climax and conclusion were fuzzy, and not action packed for the buildup that was created.If you are looking for a book that will hold you steadfastly to your seat, that a suggestion: Read Patrick Suskind's ""Perfume"". AWESOME book. It is exceptionally strange, but a great story!"
3,mixed bag,"Dean Koontz fans have written most of the reviews. This is the first Dean Koontz novel that I've read. The blurb on the book flap sounded intriguing so I bought it. I started reading it at 4:00 pm and was quite impressed with his use of the language. But about 4 chapters into the book the language started to get in the way of the story. He seems to use it to impress rather than to tell the story. By the middle of the book I realized that he had written the perfect 'made-for-TV-movie' book. I could easily visualize the special effects, the suspense and even the dialogue (sometimes cliche-ish and trite). I finished the book about 4 hours later. The plot was good, but I think I would have prefered less special effects and more character development. I'd have to agree with a previous reviewer--check the book out from the library, don't spend your money on the book."
5,"This is a good book, ignore the bad reviews here","I read the reviews here after I already purchased the book, as I was curious. I felt 'oh no, I am stuck with a book that is garbage', yet I decided to read it anyways. I am glad I did.The book is a page turner, it was hard to put down and before I knew it I was done with the book.I enjoyed the book very much and certianly glad I purchased it!Ignore the bad reviews here, it isn't like that at all."
1,From mediocre to ridiculous,"What happened to the Dean Koontz who wrote Odd Thomas? Where Odd Thomas was thoughtful and entertaining, The Taking went from mediocre to ridiculous. It wasn't even scary. Way too out there for me."
1,THe book ended with how??????????????///,Boy - I thought let me give this book a chance and was so disappointed. I read the whole book only to get to the end and feel so disappointed! I mean that was it!!!!!!!!!!!!! I read the whole book for that ending???? I should've listened to the reviewers on here!!!! I have read The Face (good book) and Odd Thomas (great book!!!) but this one..........dont bother! Read the last chapter in the book store and save your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Not worth it!,"Really...it's boring lacks substance, uninteresting, repetitive, I only finished because I was stuck in a plane for 9 hours and nothing else to read!"
2,Wow. Not good.,"Well, it's all been said already, but my $.02 makes me wonder if I'll even finish this book. For me, that is MOST rare. I usually finish even the bad stuff because otherwise I'll feel like I've hurt the book's feelings. Anyway, having only read approximately one third of this book, I am already sick of it. I'm REALLY tired of Limbaugh-esque opinions about God, Liberals, and Global Warming. If I want Christianity, I'll read the Bible. If I want rhetoric, I'll read the newspaper. If I want to hear how Global Warming is a myth, I'll listen to the Vice President. I used to love Dean Koontz but I think this will be the last (new) book of his that I'll read. Maybe I'll go back and read some of the oldies and goodies."
2,A complete let-down by the Man.,"i read this book in hopes of a good thrill. i haven't been dissapointed by Dean Koontz, until now. Yes, the beginning of the book is fantastic! i couldn't put it down. My eyes kept skipping ahead to the next paragraph before i'd finished. i did notice the 'theme' about dogs, but it's not bothersome. it's not like the dogs saved the world or anything. Anywho, when i reached the last part of the book, where everything comes together and you think, ""Oh yeeeeah. Now it makes sense."" i was actually thinking, ""WTF?!"" The end of the book made me seriously think that Dean Koontz got distracted by the 'Left Behind' series. That's the impression i got. Dean, you really let me down. You had me thinking that this was going to be 'War of the Worlds' for my generation and you ended up giving me some Sunday school lesson."
3,Terror in the Northwest,"This is a good vacation book for Koontz fans. Fast paced and an overall good read although really gruesome imagery. I liked the descriptions of Northern California with the continuous glowing rain and fog with leviathans hovering overhead. Who are these creatures? The depictions of the aliens were too strange however. Faces of the dead were in their hands - come on now. I liked how the mirrors would show what horrors were coming to those who dared to look at their reflection.Molly the main character was fearless. She and her husband had interesting backgrounds, especially Molly's crazy father who finds her in the chaos and the reasons given for Neil leaving the church.The ending was startling, you'll be surprised."
2,"Injustice, Is this really Koontz?",I logged on to leave feedback about this book and saw that it actually written years earlier in Koontz's career.I was going to say that this book had to be written by someone else who kept a thearsaurus at hand.This book is NOT the Dean Koontz whose writing I have come to love. Dean does himself a real injustice by releasing this poorly written trash.Stick with any of his other books and avoid this.
3,a page turner for sure,"I haven't read a lot of his books (nothing has matched up to ""Whispers"" for me), but this was good. I thought the ending was very satisfying.I found that I was also skimming parts of the book. It gave me the impression payment for writing was based on a per word basis.I found it confusing at times, yet, though I tried to put it down I couldn't. The ending was one of those ""NOW, I understand what all that stuff was about"" sort of things. I would read it again but not too soon. I would also recommend it as a good, creepy, fairly fast read."
2,Not my favorite.,"I have read about 20 novels by Koontz and I can't lie about it, this is one of my least favorites. I just wasn't sure where the novel was going early on and that is what ruined it from the onset. Koontz didn't make me love the characters to wanna cheer for them at all. I felt it was thrown together too easily and it was a tad clichéd. I remember I was at page 200 and I had to stop and say; what the heck? Nothing is happening here, the action was minimal and the characters were wooden...(to me) The ending was a bit of a let down as well.I have to say wow, Koontz has written like 5 books in 2 years, this is too much. The stories are not as sharp and tight as they used to be. Dean slow down and write a tight good novel like Whispers. We will wait patiently for them. I will definitely continue reading Koontz, I am and will always be a great fan of his."
4,Still thinking about it,"I read a lot and so it's a rare book that I find myself thinking of weeks or in this case, months after reading it. The familiar everyday decency of the protagonists, juxtaposed with the quiet, wrenching horror are compelling. Mostly, though, this book is just a good and thought-provoking read. I gave my copy to a circle of friends and they've all liked it. It was one of my favorite reads of 2005."
3,Koontz's Socially Concious Book,"While not one of his best, and I've read them all, Dean Koontz is making a statement about the state of mankind, post 911. Using a twist on the biblical story of the antideluvian flood, the never ending battle of good vs evil, and the idea of Satan put forth in a very interesting, and I thought, clever way, Koontz paints a picture of the evil side of mankind as a cancer that a higher power feels has to be eliminated. At first glance it seems to be about alien invasion and Koontz has us believing this right up until the very end. The imagery he paints then takes on a very powerful meaning and conveys a strong message that the world is headed to Hell in a handbasket and that the powers that be have just had enough. He references Dante's inferno, certain biblical passages and events into a story well worth thinking about. Overall, I enjoyed this book but I wish he would continue his Christopher Snow series, which I think is far superior to most things he's written."
2,Badly needs a good editor..,"Once again I am convinced that Dean Koontz is paid for his writing by the kilogram. Within the first few paragraphs he skates on the thin ice of purple prose and then smashes through to spend the remainder of the book wallowing in overblown descriptive passages. To be honest some of the images he presents are in bad taste, not for the weak stomached. I found myself on countless occasions screaming internally for him to get to the point instead of using the pages for practicing his meandering literary technique. It's a shame, because when you filter out the excess adjectives and metaphors, it's possible to see that he does indeed have immense literary talent. His publishers are doing him a misjustice in letting him run away with his imagination. They need to reign him in and firmly direct him towards more worthwhile endeavours."
3,Two and a half really,"I generally love DK's books but this one never seemed to grip me or really get going. Almost every book I've by DK read hitherto has been virtually impossible to put down but I simply couldn't generate any enthusiasm for this story at all.The characters seemed very two dimensional compared with the depth he usually puts into his portrayals. Also, the writing style seemed to hop and skip as though the author liked the idea to start with but lost interest part-way through. The ending was utterly dire. The only explanation I can think of being that DK got bored with the whole exercise and just decided to wrap it up as quickly as possible. I almost expected to read ""....and then then Mary woke up and realised it was all a dream.""Sorry, worst book of his I've read to date but I suppose even the most successful writers get a miss-hit every now and then."
4,It's time to recycle earth,"At first I thought it was going to be another ordinary alien invasion, but it turned out to be more than that. About midway through, I could see where Koontz was going, especially when people were going up through the roofs and disappearing like the description of the Rapture. Another hint wwhen I realized that if aliens were going to teraform earth to take it over, they wouldn't bother messing with peoples minds they way they did and testing their convictions. They also wouldn't have saved the children for any reason. They would just discentigrate them all and then change the planet to how they wanted it. I've always wonder if the supernatural or spiritual had a more scientific explanation. It looks like Dean Koontz does too. Although there was a lot of gore, like most of Koontz novels, it had a heart felt ending."
5,Dean Koontz fan,"Riveting!!!! As always, author Dean Koontz paints a word picture that is clear and frightening. He is one of my favorite authors."
4,End of the World - Draw Your own Conclusions and Enjoy the Ride,"I was looking for a distraction from life and found it! I have not read Dean Koontz in a long time. I forgot what a great storyteller he is. I was addicted to this book, it kept me riveted to the end. The start was great and I read every word. Later in the book, I found myself skipping parts and having to go back and read them. The book was one step away from being either a movie script or too much like the Left Behind series. The scary scenes I could visualize how they would be portrayed in a movie. The spirituality and religious angle was written for main stream American, with the reader drawing their own conclusions. I loved the analysis that the main characters, Molly and Neil, did comparing their situation to science fiction movies and writers, such as: Star Wars, Star Trek and Arthur Clarke."
2,Couldn't make it to the end of this book,"Try as I may, I couldn't make it all the way to the end of the book - A first for me in many years. I just wasn't interested. I have read a couple of other Koontz books and enjoyed them, but I wish I had skipped this one."
3,Great for an Airplane Ride,"I both loved and hated this book. It was thrilling, scary (it gave me nightmares), and shocking, but was also all over the place in terms of its storytelling. The end of each chapter was a cliffhanger, and the final revelation at the very end seemed almost an afterthought. The plot didn't wander at all, it was simply that it didn't feel as well thought-out as it could have been. The characters never seemed as surprised as they should have been at the horrors they witness throughout the night, and at the end it seemed as if Koontz had given up, letting them go with the ""strange reluctance"" to talk about anything they had gone through, as if they didn't care. On the whole, though, this book was incredibly exciting, and the twist at the end literally had my mouth hanging open. It's a perfect choice if you're going on vacation, or on a long plane ride. Just don't expect too much out of it."
4,The Taking by Dean Koonz,"I read to unwind after working a late shift working with my computer, nightly. I found it most difficult to put this book down. It is classic Koontz, keeping one glued to the page. How he manages to keep track of all the plots within plots and still tie it all together is amazing. I highly recomend this book as a superlative read."
1,"Heed the Reviews, Don't Read It!","There's really not a lot I can add to the one-star reviews. This book is boring, preachy, and downright judgemental. It drags and drags and the ending is just plain loony."
1,It's Finally Happened!!,"10,000 monkey's typing on 10,000 word processor's with thesaurus's ...Write novel..{NO}..book...In all fairness I love most of DK works..But this one Suck's"
3,Disappointing,"This book started out great, and I couldn't put it down. Once the religious aspects made themselves apparent things became more predictable and ho-hum. I wish I could take this book and rewrite the last half. Koontz is a great writer in parts, but I still find his ""whole"" unsatifying. This is only the second book I've read by him, and I can't remember the title of the first, but oddly it struck me as being unoriginal and quite a bit like Stepford Wives. This one seems to borrow heavily from the movie ""Signs"", as it interlaces the sudden onset of ETs with oddities, coincidences, and eventually, religion. Maybe I'm reading the wrong books by Koontz but I can't help but get that ""been there, done that"" feeling.I give it 3 stars for the beginning-to-middle that kept me hooked on a steady pace one night, and the quality of writing itself. But I do think the ending was silly and unfulfilling and the general idea unoriginal."
1,"Semen scented, yellow rain","I found ""Odd Thomas"" to be a highly interesting work but this short, highly padded effort, is so bad I found myself laughing out loud, amazed at the authors self revelatory nonsense and pedantic, crossword puzzle lexicon. Satans minions come in a shower of semen scented, yellow rain and all the peaceniks, drunks and hippies are swept away because mankind (through a liberal court system) has become too tolerant in it's treatment of the criminally insane. The plucky female protagonist, her non-entity of a husband, a host of dogs, assorted children and a select few (no lawyers) are left with the newly cleansed earth and a free beach house in Newport California. As an insightful study of the fantasies of an embittered, old white man it's prime stuff."
1,Don't make me laugh!,"five or four star reviewers. This book is terrible and that's all! You can't admit that your 'pet' writer wrote a very poor book full of silly similes and egocentric show of unknown words. Koontz: my advice never forget that you are only an average suspense writer. Give up with playing thesaurus and dreaming of being the new T.S. Eliot of the century! Your writing skills are very mundane If there is anyone who doesn't believe me, then get and read book if you can stand. There is no story, not a single memorable line...only description, description and again description with some words I have never heard before (maybe from 17th century) No need to mention the pretentious overblown, unreasonable message!Pity for my five hours!"
2,meh,"This book went from a good start to a mediocre middle to a bad ending. Not DK's worst but close enough. The relgion tie-in was, well for want of a better way of saying it hideous."
1,The worst book ever,"This book is one of the worst books I've ever read in my life. The impression that it gave me is that the writers think that we love reading any garbage they write and that Koontz had a certain number of pages to fill in, so he couldn't stop repeating himself... what made for such a garbage, garbage, garbage... I thought all that ridiculous rave about ETs had ended in the 1990's, but I see that some people still think that ETs will take the Earth and abduct us... Ridiculous stuff. Unfortunately, there's no zero stars."
2,Better to forget,"WOW. I feel good. There really are people here that find something redeeming in this forgottable effort.Don't misunderstand me. I love Koontz. I have read 20 books of him, but he has recently somehow changed: he started to make a list of unknown words set side by side, resulting in what? Nothing! The Taking is the zenith of his love with these non-used words, and his willingness to show us how he is in command of language; but he simply forgot something: To tell a story with strong characters.Now two stars for the great beginning (which disturbingly reminds the Mist, though just like Mr. Murder reminded Dark Half and the Door to December reminded Firestarter) and my respect for Mr. KoontzI'll tell you: Two more offers like this and I am done with Mr. Koontz, no matter how his themes and language may be evalated because if this book was by another author, I would crush it under my feet."
2,Worst Koontz novel ever !!!,"This one is just a waste of time, dont read it otherwise you would not read him again and he is a worthy enough writer to be given a second chance."
1,"Great idea, terrible delivery",I think this is a great idea for a book but the delivery SUCKS. I am normally a die hard fan of Deak Koontz but usually his books have been getting worse and worse. What is WRONG with him??? What is with all the LONG words and comparisons? This man is so busy trying to give us the meaning of life he does not focus on the story!! It took me a long time to get through this book. If you can deal with the fact he cant stop for one page to stay on the story line then maybe you can stomach through this book.
1,The Taking,I have read all of Dean Koontz's books and usually love them but this book was a total waste of money.I struggled to finish it. It was very boring and uninteresting.I am very suprised that Dean Koontz actually wrote this book.Don't waste your money.
2,don't snatch it up,"The foundation of success in a horror story is a strong, original beginning. The author must grab your attention and earn your suspension of disbelief. Dean Koontz failed to make this upfront investment in The Taking. The story caroms off of a long series of hackneyed horror elements - stormy night, body snatchers, magic mirrors, ghouls, and (Koontz's favorite) Delphic dogs - before settling down with a very modest storyline about a non-denominational rapture.Koontz can usually be counted on to deliver some pleasant thrills or humor if not the chills of real horror. But The Taking provides no such return."
2,Far Below Par,"This is supposed to be the story of how a small town reacts to the end of the world. It was supposed to be reminscent of War of the Worlds. As I have read over 20 Dean Koontz novels, generally liking the vast majority of them, I had high expectations for this book. I enjoyed how he portrayed small town reaction to catastrophe in other books, and I was excited to see the reaction to an alien invasion. Unfortunately the book starts off on the wrong foot and never recovers. The story goes from bizarre occurrences, which are mildly intriguing at best, but deals with a lot of supernatural occurrences rather than aliens. All of the weird incidents are attributed to 'aliens may have technology that makes all this weird stuff seem to defy science as we know it.' Well, that doesn't help make the story exiting or intersting, just odd."
3,What happened?!?!?!,"I've read most of Dean Koontz books. If you are a fan like me, a poor review will not deter you from purchasing this book. Do not purchase - go to the library.I honestly believed that someone had penned this book for Mr. Koontz. I thought the prose was a bit too flowery for even his style.While the lead character was well-developed, her husband Neil, who was with her every step of the way was incapable of independent thought. On one of my mental tangents because I couldn't concentrate on the book, I honestly thought the author would reveal that Neil was an alien. In addition, the theme in the end surrounded religous implications. Neil was formerly a priest - yet none of his faith or training was expressed in this book of the Apocalypse.I am waiting for my faith to be restored in his next book."
1,Horrible Book - Horrible Ending!,"I started reading this book at my Mom's Place, and I got into it, so when I left, I had to pick up a copy for myself. The first part of the book followed Koontzs typical bad, yet catchy, writing, which was sufficiently spooky enough to make me keep reading. then the ending. What the HECK! The book was all about a religious experience??? The ending did not follow the begining part of the book at all, and felt like it was just tacked on. The only reason this book got published at all is because Dean Koontz wrote it."
2,Taking a Nap,"He is a good writer but this story was very weak. The ""stunning"" revelation at the end was something that I was wondering about the entire time I was reading it. The whole book reminds me of a made for T.V movie you would see late at night on the sci-fi channel. Over the top rediculous not surprising. Perhaps its intended for kids."
2,Disappointing,"The novel starts interestingly enough; a mysterious silver rain falls and animals start behaving unnaturally. Strange weather phenomenon is experienced over the globe. Soon it becomes evident that Earth is under attack. Things get increasingly strange and horrific from there.The problem is, the horror seemed very matter-of-fact, and the characters were so bland I had little reason to care what happened to them. The only thing that kept me reading was the element of mystery - what was behind the strangeness of some of the events?The mystery is largely resolved by the end (albeit with a couple of hanging threads). The ending itself comes as an interesting surprise and it wraps up the story, but the brief exposition at the end feels kind of tacked on.This is the first Dean Koontz novel I have read. On the basis of ""The Taking"" I won't be seeking out more."
1,Don't waste your time,"Used to like Koontz, but the past few books of his I've read have really disappointed me. There are a few, but only a few OK parts of this book. I'm surprised I stuck with it til the end but somehow I did. Such a waste."
4,"Maybe not great literature, but a great read.","I really enjoyed this book. The ending was a bit abrupt, but I found it satisfying, and I liked the good vs evil, heaven vs hell theme. I wouldn't compare this with the ""left behind"" series like other people are. It's not preachy, but more like a ""what if armageddon really happens a-la ""The Stand"", etc..Like I said, I enjoy good vs evil style novels, and while the book was a bit predictable, it was a great read. Not his best book, but worth reading."
5,Facinating read..for a slightly different reason,"This book hit home far more than other Koontz books. As a resident of Crestline CA, it was obvious that he used our town as the backdrop for the story. As the protagonists journeyed through the streets of our town, it brought the story to life as no other story had in the past. I'll probably never looks at our town the same!"
2,somewhat interesting but not worth the read,"This was a difficult book to slog through. The Taking could have been so much more. It has a good concept and a good start, but loses it's way to the point that I was tempted to give up on it. It becomes muddled and lacks focus. It lumbers along with a cool idea but never really takes off. Don't waste your time."
2,Disappointing,"I couldn't wait for this book to come out. Having read the synopsis, I thought ""this is gonna be great"". I was wrong. I usually like Mr. Koontz's books. They're always interesting and fun, and he knows how to scare. This started as a good book and turned into a quasi LeHaye/Jenkins book (that's the first thing I thought of at the end). Sorry, Mr. Koontz. I hope your next book (like Odd Thomas)is great."
4,"Like War of the worlds, Koontz style.","The story is about a couple and how they deal with the alien invasion force that can control the weather and also appears to be eliminating the human race. The aliens, fungus with legs? Killer bugs? Creatures with human faces in their hands? Creepy stuff!! The alien appear to steal people's faces and read their minds using their biggest fear to destroy any hope of survival. The story starts off really strong!! I couldn't put the book down when I started to read the book, but I am disappointed with the abrupt ending. This book is his best since 'False Memory'. I have read all of Dean Koontz's books with the exception of 'The Face' and 'Frankenstein' which I will get around to eventually. Out of about the 40 books I've read of his this would be in my top 10.1. Twilight Eyes2. Intensity3. Strangers4. False Memory5. Watchers6. Midnight7. Fear Nothing8. Night Chills9. Key to Midnight10. The Taking"
4,"Take that, Survivor!","Wouldn't it be nice if aliens really took over the world and only made the mean and stupid people disappear, or would the world be left empty except for Dean Koontz?"
1,headed for the discount bin,"The sinking horror I experienced by page 2 of this book can fairly be attributed to Mr. Koontz, but perhaps not for the reasons he intended when he fabricated this clunker. ""...the rataplan of raindrops on the roof had sometimes served as a reliable remedy for insomnia. This night, however, the liquid rhythms failed to lull her into slumber..."" Are you cringing yet? Oh, it gets much worse. If you can force yourself to continue, you will be grinding your teeth to nerve endings by page 100.The sentence structure is stilted, the vocabulary pretentious. The characters are lifeless. And the dialogue--""I was plesantly soused, full of the giddy curiousity that makes dipsomania such an adventure."" Mr Koontz needs to study the art of how people speak. Read Robert B. Parker. Read Hemingway.Terrible, terrible stuff."
1,"Follow the Yellow Brick Road, Dorothy!","I was utterly stunned by Koontz and how he took a masterpiece that this book could have been and threw into the trash bin with such an insipid ending! I saw where he was heading toward the end and I prayed he would somehow reverse course and pull out a shocker ending, but, alas, no. He took the time and time again worn out path down the yellow brick road and saved the world with a boring ""and they set out to build the world anew"" hackneyed, blase quickie wrapup in the final pages. It was as if he put his heart and soul into this book, then suddenly became bored with it and decided to wrap it up as succinctly as possible to get it over with. I have been a life long Koontz fan, and I was utterly crushed by how shabbily he has treated his loyal readers with this one. For shame, Mr. Koontz! How dare you have the nerve to even charge for this one!"
5,One of my favorites,"This was a really interesting book. It was suspenseful and kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next. It looks like people either love it or hate it. I enjoyed it. It was completely implausible and often I had to laugh at the impossible things Koontz was able to dream up and describe so vividly. It was just a really good trip to another world, really."
3,The Taking...,This was a disappointment for Koontz fans. I thought the beginning had some potential...but the ending was garbage! It seemed Mr. Koontz rushed the ending. I was not amused. Could've been better.
3,"Not his best, but worth a read anyhow.","I didn't enjoy this book nearly as much as some of his other works (Odd *, Life Expectancy), but it was still a good read. The pace is pretty good and there are a few good creep-outs, but as far as ""holy crap, something is really wrong with the world"" books go, I'd recommend Stephen King's Cell long before The Taking. But even bad Koontz is better than John Saul on his best day."
4,one of my favorites,"This was my first Koontz book (since then I've read many) and I think it's still my favorite. One reviewer said it ""will likely let you down, unless your favorite theme in Koontz's books is the transcendence of horror by uplifting spirituality"". Well, yes! That's the whole reason I read Koontz books - otherwise I don't think I'd be able to sleep at night! I love the redemption twist he writes into many of his stories (The Face, anyone?). Anyone can write straight horror without hope, but Koontz acknowledges a bigger picture, and I hope he keeps it up."
3,Overwrought prose and a disappointing ending,"Like many of those who have already posted comments, I'm basically quite a fan of Koontz. His best stuff (Lightning, Dark Rivers) is fast paced and holds your attention; The Taking, however, unfolds in slow motion, with way too much purple prose and an overtly sermon-like final chapter.Overall, the book reads like a cross between an updated ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Night of the Living Dead"" with an overlay of religiosity.This is one of Koontz's shorter novels: only 338 pages, widely-spaced lines, and lots of blank pages scattered throughout. It's really more of a novella than a novel. And I'm getting tired of nearly EVERY Koontz novel having a courageous young woman as its protagonist, and a heroic dog as a supporting character. Here's an idea, Dean: write a book about a 50-year-old black guy who has cats as pets. You can do it!"
2,Wow... that was a letdown.,"I'm a big time Koontz fan, and I find most of his books to be suspenseful page-turners. I anxiously look forward to his books as they came out. My wife picked this up for me when it came out and within the first chapter I was thinking ""Wow, what a letdown"". This book just lacks the intense page-turning suspense of his usual books. It picked up a little further into the book, but tended to drag on. I found the story/concept in the book interesting, but the story itself just wasn't written up to my expectations for his books."
2,I think Koontz has lost it.,"There was a time when I could not wait for the next Dean Koontz book to come out. Those were the days of books like 'Watchers', 'Lightning' and 'Whispers. The last few, especially 'The Taking' have been down hill and not worth the bother. It seems Koontz is far more interested in getting his own political views across than he is in writing good books. Sorry to say it but this was my last Koontz read."
2,i was taken aback,"At one time I was a huge fan of DK. After reading many of his tomes and enjoying most of them, it seemed his quality of story-telling dropped off. But every now and then I like to pick up a new DK offering just to see if things have returned to a readable level. The last Koontz book I really enjoyed was ""False Memories."" I had hoped ""Taken"" would suprise me and prove to be up to my standards. The surprise was how bad it was. Or a least how bad it turned out to be. That's the key to my low rating: how bad it turned out to be. For a while it was, if not compelling, interesting reading. I spent a good bit of time wondering where it was going and for me, that's a good thing. But it went nowhere. Somewhere between the platitudes and metaphors, finishing the book was not easy. And then came the totally disappointing denouement. Dean Koontz has ""taken"" his talent to a new low....so low you'd have to dig up to bury it."
1,Worst Koontz Book Ever,This really deserves no stars. The book could have been about 100 pages long and that would have been too long. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. Not at all like his other great books.
3,Lighten up!,"I'm finding it quite amusing that people are freaking out so much over the religious themes in this novel. I don't consider myself a religious person(I believe in a higher power..but don't ascribe to a specific religion)but I'm not threatened by different viwepoints.This is a novel, not non-fiction. I think this book was decent, and I enjoyed the fact that it went in a different direction than I thought it would.I think people need to lighten up. If you didn't enjoy the book, thought it was poorly written, that's fine. But it makes me roll my eyes when people start thinking that something must be ""bad"" because they don't agree with the values/beliefs/viewpoints that it presents."
3,Chilling beginning...decent middle...quirky ending,"The Taking is the first Dean Koontz novel I have ever read. The early part of the book, the first third or so, is so chilling and tension filled that I quickly developed a great respect for Koontz as an author. Other reviewers here tell you about the story in great detail so I'll just share a few points. The story, at least two or three times, turns out to be a different kind of story than the reader expects. Just when you think you have it figured out, you'll discover you're wrong. The main characters are well drawn out and the heroes quite likeable. The story is wonderfully creepy while it keeps you guessing.The ending was a surprise. I think some readers were quite surprised. I think you will be too. The book is well worth the few hourse needed to read it."
3,"Great Pageturner, But Overly Florid","I enjoyed The Taking. The only downside, as mentioned in the Publisher's Weekly review, was the overly poetic nature of some of Koontz's writing. It really detracts from an otherwise positive reading experience...so much so that I actually stopped reading for a few days in order to approach it with less aggravation. Koontz is a brilliant writer at times, but he overdoes it...for no noticable reason. The story is well paced, with enough mystery, horror and atmosphere to challenge Koont's other works. I have to give it 3 stars though, because I've never been distracted by writing style as much as I was with this novel."
3,A good read.,The author is his own worst enemy here. He sets up the climax so well that anything less than a breathtaking ending would be a let down. I was more like what...?? at the ending. But I still enjoyed reading the book and couldn't put it down for most of it.
4,a Dark movie,"Really cool movie, I was waiting for this edition long time ago, great sound and footage never seen before, got the director's comentary and some good extras as well, is a sci-fi movie that you must own!"
5,Sci-fi Classic,"When i first saw Dark city,my first thought after watching was one word:Classic,It reminded me of such films as blade runner,the acting was excellent,the sets gothic and the story surprising in that it holds your attention throughout.in my opinon it will stand the test of time."
2,Don't believe the hype!,"This movie has a good premise and an excellent set, but crappy writing! There's no story development. Everything we need to know is told in short bursts. I was annoyed because the movie unfolded without rhyme or reason. The movie felt more like a trailer. And the acting... Sutherland was totally miscast as the scientist. He seemed to be hyperventilating everytime he spoke. ""The strangers"" sounded like they ripped off their vocals from The Exorcist. Over-acted and over-rated, that sums it up!"
4,A great movie for the mind-bending SCIFI fan.,"If you're looking for a nice romantic comedy, stop reading here. This movie is great for people who like to think, in abstract ways, about who we are vs. who we think we are. How much do we really know? How can we be sure of so many of the things we take for granted? If you like stretching your mind, get this movie. If not, move on to Titanic."
2,Dark. Depressing. And not very good.,"While this film does live up to it's name, I wouldn't exactly say that it's stunningly rendered. I can think of many better ways to spend two hours."
2,What a waste,"This film gets five stars for looks, but looses three for a poor story and plot. Its just another shlock film. Look elsewhere...."
1,Sound issues w/Blu Ray,"I tried 2 different blu ray discs and with both got a terrible constant static noise when playing either the Director's Cut or Theatrical Version. No matter how I tried changing sound settings on my player and tv, I never could correct the problem. Very disappointed."
4,"Great movie, but the description is misleading - Blu only has one Disc","This is a great movie and it's fantastic on blu-ray, but I was led to believe it had 2 discs by the description on Amazon. This is false. It has only 1 disc."
5,The best movie I have ever seen !!!!,"This movie showed me how small and limited we are. Where are we from? where can we go? The movie brings to us the idea that we can't go anywhere from where we are, and we don't now where do we came from, and we are nothing more but a sum of our memories. It is a movie that nobody can miss!"
3,"Very clever, very dark... but not that great a story!","I saw this one at the theater, and while I enjoyed it, I didn't feel like I'd seen a particularly good movie as I left. Maybe it's just my opinion, but special effects aside, I thought this one was pretty empty."
5,Dark City - a classic,"I had ""Dark City"" on VHS, but bought it again on DVD after I purchased a DVD player. This really is a great movie, not only for it's beautiful photography, but also for excellent storytelling. The movie really does deserve to be watched twice before judging. When I watched this movie the first time, I felt the same emotions that the main character, John Murdock felt, because I was so confused - as was he - about what was happening to him. As the movie progressed, and Mr. Murdock, yes, became more aware, so did I. Excellent, Excellent. Great DVD features as well with 2 commentary tracks. I would give it more stars if possible."
3,same story as the matrix,"The movie wasn't bad but Dark City is the same thing as the Matrix. A man is suddenly contacted that the world he lives in is not real. There are nosferatu like ""bad guys"" that walk around hidden and like pretty much control everything. This man needs to find his secret hidden power. He finds it at the very end and battles with the bad guys with his new discovered power. Its the same story...watch one or the other. They're both ok."
2,This movie is a bit boring,The movie had interesting scenes here and there but for the most part it wasn't all that exciting.
1,Shamefully Bad,"Terrible acting, lousy script, well that just about sums up Dark City, a retro-science fiction disaster that has a trite story line and characters so flat you could slide them under a door. I have no idea why this film is popular with anyone. Please don't waste your time with this poor attempt."
2,Good blu-ray quality. Story didn't hold interest.,"Even though the story was meant to keep you wondering what was really happening, I found it to be rather boring and complicated. Scenes with the bald guys recurred too often and were not interesting. There are some good special features. Director's cut offered considerably more content. For a movie which was supposed to be dark, the quality was good, but the scenery was bland."
3,"OK but I liked Heston's ""Dark City"" better","This film noir suspenser is an OK way to spend an evening but won't be filed in many people's list of great detective films. The story involves a guy whose memory seems a-twitter who is obviously the pawn of aliens. Sounds goofy? It is.There is some stylish production values in the oddball city where it is always night and rainy, and there are many famous actors in the starry cast.However, I liked Charlton Heston's first film, ""Dark City"", from 1950 much more than this one. I doubt the two were related in any significant way other than having the same title since Heston's movie, his first starring role, was about the underworld, as I recall.In any event, this movie is an OK night with the DVD player."
4,The greatest film of all time never gets the respect it deserves.,"Yes, Dark City is my favorite movie ever made, and while this Blu-ray is the way to watch it, it still doesn't get the respect it deserves.Included on the disc are the original Theatrical cut and the new Directors cut (who would have thought you could improve on near perfection?). Many great special features and generally everything you could ask for. Except good video quality.While this release looks good (for a 10 year old film) and better than DVD, Dark City deserves better, so I can only give this 4/5. None-the-less, Dark City is worth your time and this Blu-ray is the best way to see it. As a film it stands with the best of dystopian Sci-Fi like Blade Runner, so if you haven't seen it, you need to.I wish more reviewers would remember, we are rating the Blu-ray here, not the film. We have to consider the entire package, and while Dark City is a 5 star film, this is not a 5 star release."
5,Best movie of 1998. Sci-fi future classic.,"This was a total surprise to me. I wasn't expecting such a well made movie. Finally someone in Hollywood had an original idea. The story is unlike any I have seen in the movies. It keeps you guessing right until the end. In these current days of predictable plots and cliches, this was a breath of fresh air."
4,Engrossing...Will keep you guessing until the conclusion,"I like stylish movies. This movie has plenty of style to spare. But what keeps me coming back to Dark City is the sense of mystery. The story unravels in such a way that it never fails to creep me out, even though I know the surprise ending. The main character has no idea how this mystery is going to end, and watching him desperately trying to figure it out is a pleasure. That the final conflict isn't a plain old shootout is a bonus. Strap on your thinking caps and have fun with it."
1,Blu-Ray Audio Malfunction,"For some obscure, techno-geek reason, some blu-ray discs won't function on certain blu-ray DVD players, Sony chief among them. I tried two different copies of this blu-ray and encountered the same malfunction, which was major distortion in the 7.1 DTS audio of the film itself. Back to the regular DVD release for me: some technical advancement is functionally a step backward."
4,Within the new generation of Sci-Fi movies-ala-Matrix and space/aliens spicy!!!,"Among the questionining reality movies I just purchased Dark City and hell of a movie!! The plot takes us to a super doomy/glommy always-at-night city where a guy is chased by cops and some strange men who have the ability to alter time and the city itself into the reality they want and need. The matter is they are experimenting with human beings and there is only one guy who knows the truth (a bizarre performance by Kiefer Sutherland) This takes into not so deep philosophycal themes but good pace of twisted tricks and a climax totally unexpected (not telling you the end!!!) But if you like Matrix where ''external'' creatures are toying with humankind destiny and make you think what reality ''really'' is about then I highly recommend this to you. Go and get it, I did it and believe me, I am a sci-fi fan, so if you like it as much as I do you will not be disappointed!"
2,Interesting Concept but Delivered Poorly in the Film,"As a sci-fi fan, I've often wondered how good this film was. I took the notion to purchase the film and it was absolutely not what I expected. The antagonists in the film were way too weird to even imagine they could be real. The story has an interesting concept and I believe that it could have been delivered much better than the cheese seen in this movie. Don't let the well known actors fool you in this one. They're at their worst delivering some of the most cheesy dialog with superficial expression. This one is going back to the sale rack."
1,Blu-Ray Sounds make for an unpleasant movie nite,I should have read the reviews before I purchased this but this was my first blu-ray disc and I was a little too hasty. When you first put it in you hear something - then as the movie progresses you hear more... what is that? Static on a brand new DVD (BD)?... wow I thought I was going crazy until I read the reviews and other articles on the internet. DO NOT PURCHASE if you expect to play the sound via HDMI into a TV like I did.
2,Great sets,"The movie has great sets, and is kind of a mix between matrix and blade runner. However the acting is unconvincing, the big secret is revealed at the beginning, and the character development is weak."
1,Broken DVD,"Upon opening the DVD case, the DVD was cracked from edge to center. I was not able to play the DVD and I promptly returned it."
2,Waste of Time,"I gave this movie one star for the incredibly freaky, yet artistic setting of the movie. I gave it another star because the overall story IS good. Unfortunatly, Hollywood has again succeeded in messing up a movie that had potential. This movie was a total and complete waste of my time. It's so confusing that it gave me a headache. Not only that, the characters aren't developed enough, the acting is lousy, and the ending was totally and completly stupid. It didn't scare me; it bored me to tears."
5,Twilight Zone - ish,"I liked the part where they went to Shell Beach. Anyway, great movie, and good casting of Rufus Sewall - he has that other wordly look about him at times (especially his eyes!!)"
4,"Incredible, Gothic Effects!","This DVD experience is worth the buy. The story is clasic science fiction, but the set design and cinematography are very cutting edge. Just buy it.. We can't all be wrong....."
4,Tippy and Good,"I couldn't say I was more surprised. I loved this movie. You should get this movie. Surprise ending, you might not see this coming. The director of Crow, did it again. Another great movie to sit down and watch."
4,One of my favorites,Science fiction set in an alien created alternate reality floating in space. Great special effects and decent story line. Bongeriffic!
4,Dark City - Director's Cut,"Fairly original concept concerning otherworld entities trying to comprehend and integrate the human psyche in order to expand their own intelligence. Although, it is slightly derivative of both Star Trek: The Next Generation's Borg and the Cenabites from Hellraiser fame and their conquest of human souls. Kiefer Sutherland is unconvincing as the deranged scientist."
4,I Like It for Different Reasons,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSIt's intriguing to watch the nostalgic city transform and its citizens switch roles. William Hurt's performance is spot on. The sci-fi part of the story is okay, and Kiefer Sutherland's speaking is a bit distracting, but all in all Dark City is entertaining.Caveat: It does have one rather graphic murder scene and some nudity.***Mild spoiler***My favorite scene is between Bumstead and Walenski: ""My wife? She's not my wife. I don't know who she is. I don't know who any of us are."""
3,Problematic,"The transfer is uneven. It generally has a sharpened look with sometimes obvious halos and faces often look waxy due to grain filtering. Some shots have smearing from the filtering. And a couple have aliasing problems. It's not a horrible transfer, though. It's overall ok and quite watchable. But the grain processing and sharpening is unnecessary and damages the film look."
5,"The critics are not us, are they? ;-)","Although the plotline has a few holes in it, you will never notice. Dark City invites you in, then immerses you in a surreal nightmare from which there is no escape (as a character or a viewer). This is possibly the most captivating film I have ever seen, and a pure delight to watch. Oh yes... lock the doors and turn off the phone."
5,Will be considered classic one day.,"Though this movie is not for everyone, anyone who appreciates a well thought out script that has you guessing until the end will love this movie.It screams genius all the way with amazing set design and a completely of the wall story.I watched this movie with a girlfriend and was very surprised at the end to find out she loved it as much as i did! I actually bought my DVD player just to get a superior copy of the movie. I guess you can tell I enjoyed it alot. Happy Watching.."
5,A hidden gem,"A brilliant movie made even better in Blu-Ray. A great Sci-fi story with wonderful performances by Rufus Sewell, William Hurt and Keifer Sutherland. Highly recommended."
5,Even Better,The great vision of this movie is enhanced with the Blu-Ray format.This movie is made for High-Def and a big screen.
2,"Great looking, if a somewhat empty story.","Going against the grain, I was disappointed by this film. It looked like a million bucks, had outstanding art direction, set design, and special effects. In that, there was vision. But the story is convoluted, and often has nothing coherent to keep it driving forward. Like it suffered from an identify crisis. I often felt like I was watching something impressive (and expensive), but with nothing in the story to keep my curiosity going or my anticipation up I had a hard time keeping interest."
4,Strong Sci-Fi in this flick,"Strong in story and plot, weak on characters, Dark City is a triumph considering today's mundane choice of genX and couples comedies. The story reminds of a Rod Serling twilight zone twist. This piece of sci-fi is sure to be talked about for a long time to come. Only hitch: the aliens look exactly like the cenobites from ""Hellraiser"" fame."
1,AWFULL: Mortal Combat meets Crouching Tiger,"I'd add ""meets 28 Days Later"" to the title, but that would be an insult to 28 days.Wow. I can't believe this movie got so many rave reviews. Maybe it would be useful if the reviews included the reviewers age.To even mention Blade Runner in context with this movie is a joke.We both fell asleep, twice!They don't make movies like they used to, thats for sure.I wish I too could fight evil by pointing my forehead and issuing a ""shockwave"".Look for my copy to turn up soon, cheap.If you're an adult, best to skip this excersize in stupidity."
2,Wasted potential,"This sci-fi noir thriller has some yawning gaps in its plot, and the sets, though interesting, can't make up for the paucity of material. A friend who knew of my appreciation for ""Blade Runner"" recommended ""Dark City"" to me. I don't base this review on Ridley Scott's film (which has its own flaws and contradictions), but on its own the movie feels flat. It belongs more to the world of ""Dick Tracy"" than ""Blade Runner"" or ""Metropolis"". Actors like Keifer Sutherland, Ian Richardson and William Hurt are wasted in this half-hearted effort."
5,BRILLIANT!,WHAT A MOVIE WILL KEEP YOU MESMERIZED FROM BEGINNING TO END.(NOTE:NOT A MOVIE FOR EVERYONE-WEIRD AND BROODY).
4,the dark side of 'The Truman Show',"that about sums it up :-)lots and lots and lots of style, not a whole lot of feeling. terrific FX and some nice touches (the aliens' names, for example). but a month or two later, I remember nothing but the ambience. it was good ambience though :-)"
4,Good movie,"The acting is good, the plot strange but interesting, all in all well worth watching at least once, and probably multiple times ( I bought the DVD)."
3,Worth A Purchase,"Definitely worth a purchase if you want to show off the capabilities of a DVD player. It's easily one of the best-looking movies of the last 20 years. The special effects didn't look like CGI, which is a nice change for once. My only complaint about visuals is that in the first quarter of the movie, the cuts were too quick. No shot lasted longer than 3-5 seconds. It was distracting to have such beautiful shots, then have them taken away too quickly. I felt like I was watching Armageddon. Thankfully that calmed down as the movie went on. The premise is exciting, but the plot and characters seemed empty. If not for the wonderful, nuanced performances from Sewell, Hurt, Kiefer, and the wonderful Connelly, this movie wouldn't have been nearly as impressive. If you liked Proyas' ""The Crow,"" but want a quieter, subtler dark movie, buy this great DVD."
5,**AB-FAB PIC****,"This is an awesome movie!!! I knew l'd like it just from the ads. It's sci-fi at it's best and it was just made to be seen on DVD. It had Rufus Sewell and Ian Richardson (one of my all time fave actors), l had reservations about the acting skills of Kiefer Sutherland, but l was pleasantly suprised. He does a pretty good job. The special effects remind me of ""Spawn"" and yes..The Matrix is similar, maybe it's why l loved them both."
4,Original and Refreshingly Different,I saw this movie at the theatre and was surprised. It is one of the best movies I have seen in years. Because it is original and imaginative I don't expect most people will like it. Imagination and taste are not qualities of American culture today. I remember when Blade Runner first came out--it was not popular either. I doubt it did well in Montgomery.
2,Sound is messed up,"Ok, I have an excellent system, new Sony Blu Ray, Onkyo amplifier and a Vizio TV. However, when playing this disc the audio has this unbearable noise that makes it impossible to enjoy. Plot?? who cares, I can't hear it."
3,Jennifer Connelly,I bought this before watching it... it's a Jennifer Connelly thing. I would run away with her in a heartbeat.... but this is not one of her best movies. So I would would suggest renting it first. If you love it then buy it.
3,Rent it,"Acting and Plot arn't that great, neither are special affects. I'm not saying it's not worth watching but it isn't worth buying."
1,Sorry but I hated this film,"Dark City is one of the few films that I have ever disliked to watch. I found it difficult to pay attention to the film because it was so un-entertaining. Admittedly, its plot is different and looks at existing ideas in a fresh angle but the style of this film was not for me."
3,"Good acting and good setting, yet much to be desired.","The actors did a good job of bringing a sense of realizim to the film. However I would have expected a little more realizim for Kifer. Direction calls for a good note and special effects were tastefull and well placed (most of the time). Minus 2 stars for story telling and the Dolby digital sound track. The story line evolves slowly at first, almost to slow. If you stick with it, the story line will catch you. I've never hear a wost sounding DD sound track. Imaging was totaly out of wack and voices seemed a little delayed (granted, I don't have the best theater system; but its pretty good). I'd expect this from a 1980's martial arts VHS but not from a film realsed this recently. Bottom line, if you have 96 minutes to spare check this dvd out for the cinemetography and the directors vision. By the way, rent it. Your dvd collection will survive with out this one."
5,The Best Sci-Fi Movie Ever,This movie I was impresed with right from the begining. just with all the city images andhow they changed the city every night was just fantasticly done.and the story keeped you going right in the first five minuets.Its a story of a man's suffered a memery loss and a demented geius helps him control his power.When his memory is lost he is framed for a murder.A sympathetic detective is after him and a group of ominous beings are after him. throghout the movie you have questions that you want to be ansered and they are ansered in time throgh the movie.Anyone who loves a good Sc-Fi and mystery with awesome speacial effects than see dark city. It is the best Sci-Fi movie I have ever seen.
1,Turn on the Lights of Dark City,"The only thing that kept me from walking out of the theatre was the interesting visuals. Otherwise, it stunk."
1,What garbage!,"Could I please have that 2 hours of my life back? I am one of the world's biggest SCI-FI fans, and I thought this was utter (insert profanity of your choice here). Dark (as in impossible to see), unintelligible, and frustrating as hell."
4,Really weird movie,"I guess you could say 'The Matrix' got its inspiration from this movie. Or maybe it just ripped it off!Rufus Sewell plays a man who is being pursued by a bunch of very very weird people. As he runs through the very strange trying to escape from them, he discovers some holes in his life. It just doesn't add up. He later discovers that aliens have pulled a 'Matrix' on the whole city and he is the one who can save all the humans.The similarities of Dark City to The Matrix are staggering though Dark City is well darker, and definitely weirder. In place of scary agents, you have bald headed weirdos in overcoats who look like Pinhead from Hellraiser. An interesting movie to say the least. Very weird and has a rather satisfying ending. Watch it!"
4,Hokey but very entertaining!,"I hope most find this filmn enjoyable on the level of ""wonder"". I chose to buy this film not because Ebert endorsed it. (it was my first DVD. and I'm glad I have it.) I like sci-fi twists and turns mixed with mystery. The audio 5.1 DD sountrack is superb along with the goodies on the DVD. I base my stars on enlightenment and entertainment. This one is fantastic! In my view a 5 star goes only to films that get me out of my chair. This one, almost got me their. Excellent film!"
4,Good for its time,"3.5 stars. A strong pre-Matrix film of everything not quite being what it seems. Rufus Sewell give a decent performance of man trying to figure out where he belongs and questioning why things are the way they seem. A good antihero who is given the opportunity of a lifetime. For the me, the strongest thing this film has going for it is it unique setting. The creatures of Dark City were one of the first to combine old (1940-ish) with the new (future-looking setting) to come out with some thing their own. Later the same technique is used in such films as The Shadow and Sky Captain and the world of tomorrow.For the most part, the script is strong-again for its time-there are few painful lines. Plus Keifer Sutherland just looks like he having the time of his life in his role. Overall, it's a decent movie for a lazy sunday afternoon."
5,A new genre of reality......,"What do ""The Larry Truman Show"", ""The Matrix"", ""Hypercube"" and ""Darkcity"" hold in common?A twist of new reality!Deforming ones paradigm of the world can make a very interesting storyline. Popular science has just begun to explore new dimensions like hypersapce and this makes a very good inspiration for moviewriters. In a world that is unbound by matter, energy,space and time all things can happen and are allowed. This gives moviemakers and directors limitless flexibility, the sky will become even less than the limit!Darkcity is a movie that you'd wanna watch with your girlfriend on a rainy night at home."
3,"Interesting, disturbing even, but NOT scarry....","First, I LOVE the sets and the visual effects - superb.Second, Rufus Sewell and Kiefer Sutherland gave first class performances.The wardrobe, sets, and makeup had a lot of potential for horror but it just didn't come out that way.Several scenes were disturbing but nothing really shocking.Certainly no horror moments in this movie - feel free to watch it with the lights out and a lightening storm outside.NOT a scarry movie - too bad, could have been a good one."
2,Disappointing,"With all the great reviews, I thought this would be a great movie to buy for Blu-ray. Well, I was disappointed on both fronts. Even though I love sci-fi, I did not enjoy the movie. And, there was nothing spectacular about viewing it on Blu-ray. Although the movie was definitely not predictable, it was monotonous, boring, and a seriously uninteresting ending that made me feel like I wasted my time."
3,INTERESTING AND ATMOSPHEREIC AND OF COURSE.....DARK!,"This is a very cool film. A dreamlike movie with it's story of amnesia and surreal set design. It can get a bit confusing at times, but I thought it was a very bold attempt that succeeds on many levels. The DVD is excellent with some great extras and a good DVD transfer. Please don't call me a F***ing Tool for not giving it 5 stars!....LOL!;-b (someone did this in a comment).....too mucking fuchh! ;-)"
5,Dark City on acid is an experience.,Dark City is an above average sci-fi movie and an enjoyable way to spend an evening. The DVD is a great transfer.Dark City on acid is an experience.
5,"brilliant, but goes over most heads","Stylistic, dark, surreal, sci-fi thriller, that does not spoon feed you the usual, invaders from Mars shoot em-up tripe. Really quite deep, if you are a little fed up with standard fare give this one a try but be ready for a challenge! Definitely an epic masterpiece that is over most heads. Awesome ending. Also I enjoyed the commentary of Roger Ebert, which in itself is quite surreal."
2,BluRay Sound Issues,"This is just a comment on the BluRay copy I purchased. Maybe I got a bad one, but the sound on the primary track was very distorted. All other tracks played fine, so maybe I got a bad disc. At the price, I can't complain (too much), but buyer beware.The movie, of course, is excellent and the BluRay LOOKS great. Shame about the sound, though."
4,"Fantastic, creative film!","Extremely well written and well acted. Thought-provoking plot,always surprising and fun. Suprising combination of history and future combined with science-fiction. Enjoy and have fun!"
4,Need to be fully engaged,The plot in this movie is complex enough that a viewer will not follow it unless he/she stays very involved. Plan to actively watch the movie to get it.
4,Sideshows of Route 66,The book contained a great amount of side trips along Route 66 that made the journey even more fun and adventurous. Follows the westbound route.I used it as a companion to the Route 66 EZ Guide by Jerry McClanahan.
5,Detailed book,This is very well written and detailed book. It doesnt have colored pictures but there is quite few of them...
2,It is OK!,"The item itself is OK. I ordered it thinking that it would be map and more detail guidebook. However, the book itself does not have too much information. The seller was great packaging the item and sending it efficiently. The item itself was not as informative as I thought."
3,Not a bad book...,"My family took a road-trip down part of Route 66 for my son's spring break. (march 2010) This was not a bad book to have with us. I did use the EZ guide more though. Still, It had some good info in it. I was glad I had both."
2,Not enough details,"The places suggested in this book were good. However, there were hardly any details such as the address or phone numbers. Without that information it was difficult to locate some of the attractions."
5,route 66 adventure handbook,I recieved the book within a week in excellent condiion. I am very pleased with this seller.
5,Route 66 -----connect the dots,This book was the most practical guide to touring Route 66.It keeps one from getting lost and this book plus the state route 66 maps are most helpful.
5,The best Route 66 guide book available,"I used the first edition of this book last year on my Route 66 trip (this edition came out only a week after I had left!). I liked it so much that I bought the new edition and gave the old one to a friend.Route 66 Adventure Handbook is both comprehensive and easy to use. I had no trouble following along while on the road - not once did I get lost. Drew really knows his stuff and very clearly points out the attractions that you don't want to miss. Also, I highly recommend reading this cover to cover before you even get in the car. It really helped me decide ahead of time what I wanted to see in the time I had. I'll most definitely use it again on my next trip!"
3,interesting but better check it out of the library,"nowhere near as enjoyable as literature as the Route 66 Companion, this had snippets of information about the history and places along the Route, not much depth here, useful as a background of the cities along the route, many now bypassed and living, if at all, in faded glory, or still vital but not much remains of their Route legacy."
4,First timers on Route 66,"Book was a good supplementary one to have on places-of-interest that may not be highlight in other books. Doesn't help really if you are looking for directions on how to get somewhere, more so helps with giving you some things to look for in the different areas. Happy to have had it though."
5,Awesome guide for anyone going out on Rte. 66,"Went on a roadtrip last week and traveled by lots of old Route 66 stops, and we were so happy we picked this book up beforehand. It has everything you need to know about the drive, and pointed us too areas that we would have just zoomed by otherwise. If you're going on any part of Route 66 pick this book up!"
5,A fantastic reference. A must read before your own run down the route!,A very well assembled book. I used it very frequently on my last trip. Great detail and background on nearly every town along the route.
3,Complete Triathlon Book - Review May 2008,"I bought my Complete Triathlon Book ( Matt fitzgerald) in 2007. I compete in many Duathlons and a few Triathlons.I also run competively 1 or 2 times per week. In general im pretty competitive, like to be near the front, so was looking for lots of new tips etc . I would rate the book as ok. The cover looks great. To get my higher rating I would hope to see many more pictures ' preferably in color' to illustrate various beneficial tri techniques, equipment and ways to save those vital seconds.I'm still looking for the perfect Tri Book.To date I have found my best advice in seperate swim , bike and run books.Gerry K"
3,Triathlon Book Review,A decent book. I wish they would have left out a lot of the mind mumbo jumbo stuff. Was looking for a basic training/equipment quide.
2,Extremely Basic and Fairly Obvious Material,"I read this book in a couple hours after I received it in the mail. I've competed at the most basic amatuer level in triathlons, and I've led a life that is relatively healthy (I run often, know how to swim, and I take a long bike if the weather permits). Knowing how to eat right, and how to stretch, this book provide absolutely no help to me. If, though, you've never done anything althetic before, and you don't know that ""whole foods are better for you than processed foods,"" and you need to be told not to eat mayonaise three times a day, then maybe you should consider reading this before competing in a triathlon. I was very disappointed."
3,Some good info,"This book has a lot of useful information, but I don't agree with some of the author's statements ""Triathlon is very much an image sport,"" and the description of the importance of having matching stylish clothing. Also, the section on running seems to think that the answer to every running problem is simply to run faster. Other than that, a lot of the other information is useful."
4,A Wake in Providence,Great local film!! Most of or if not all of it was filmed in Providence and the surrounding areas. If your a Rhode Islander you will appreciate this film. See how many locations you recognize.
2,Disappointed!,I'm a regular KDFC listener and I was really disappointed by this CD. The music selections did not seem well thought out and many of the performances seemed amateurish. I was basically bored by this and would not recommend it. There are so many other beautiful Christmas CD's out there. Save your money. Sorry guys!
1,"Boring, depressing snapshot","I read about 100 pages of this minimalist novella (come on - this is NOT a BOOK) and wanted to gargle with razor blades. It's ssssoooooo minimalist & boring you can't get a handle on what's happening where why to whom what time of year ... well I'm sorry but I would never read another of this author's attempts. I like to get lost in a story, this one just shoved me away. Thank goodness I got this one from the library. $24.00 for 200 pages????????"
3,Life In Harlem As A Paramedic During The 1990's,"This is rather a grim portrayal of the life Frank Verbeckas experienced. He seemed to escape by taking gruesome photographs of the scenes he encountered. Of interest were his relationships with his collegues Burnett, his partner and Hock who enticed him into participating in narcotic thefts. Also of note was his up and down connection to his brother Norman a skilled surgeon. Most meaningful theme of the book was his tender love affair with the doomed girl Emily who suffered and eventually succumbed to HIV. All in all, I found this to be an average decent read."
1,Unhappy purchase,Very unhappy with this purchase. It turns out that it is a large print volume and only the first half of the book. There was no indication in the description that it was large print and only one of two volumes.
1,BEWARE!,"BEWARE! This is one of the worst videos EVER! It consists mostly of a lot of screaming girls, mostly blonds, making fools of themselves. In no instance does a stripper do a complete performance. The production values are nil. The lighting is too dim to show even the brief performaces. This video is a complete ripoff. I'm tossing mine into the waste bin."
2,my review of raw & exposed,"I viewed this DVD and would give it a 1 out of 5 stars. This is great if you are in college and researching male dancers or something but otherwise it's kind of lame. It shows about 5 dancers in one club and they interview various women in the club and get their opinions about strippers. I still have not made the connection as to why Ron Jeremy has anything to do with this documentary! Ladies, if you are expecting to see skin, this DVD shows very little. Others may have a limmited interest if you have followed the male dancer trends in the US."
1,"""Raw,Exposed, Untold"" was never Raw and very small Exposed and could have been left Untold!!!!","This video was not any good at all, please dont waste your money. I am a male and I really thought that they where going to show alot more and better looking men and it wasn't. Whoever was the camera man and the director need to really watch nude men,at times it seeems like he didn't want to show alot of the men waist down....yeah you see something once in awhile but it seems to me that more women in the audience had alot of camera time. It really was not worth the money and It could have been alot better. Women or Gay Men could have shot this video better and given better sceans. I can't believe I wasted my money on this video.... but wait, on the cover of the video it has ""Director's Cut""!!!! He should have cut more and put in more men and instead of showing the upper body and eyes he should have worked on the lighting in the club better and showed why people really go to see exotic male dancers."
3,Delivery and content,"Okay DVD. Delivery was excellent. It was informative, but not great. Fun to watch."
4,IT DELIVERS!!!,"I have had the priviledge of viewing this and found it to be very insightful into the world of exotic male dancers, and trust me it delivers!! From start to finish, this film keeps you totally involved and interested in what really happens. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone!!"
5,HOT! HOT! HOT!,"My friends and I were at Legends (a strip club in London, Ontario) when they were filming the dancers last summer. I didn't get interviewed like the previous reviewer did, but it was still a pretty wild night. The club was really packed that night and there were plenty of cute dancers. My favourite is Southern Heat, a really cute latino guy. Since none of these dancers were from London, I was hoping to get a copy this documentary from TV, but now that it's comming out on DVD I just buy that. I wonder what they put into the deleted scenes section."
1,Doesn't work with my 60g video iPod,"It doesn't work; the LED comes on with a fresh battery, but my Ipod simply doesn't charge or show any sign of being connected to this device."
1,Don't buy!,"This iteam doesn't work.The light didn't even come on. If you want a portable charger go with the one from sharper image, it works."
1,Don't waste your money,"The charger simply does not work with an iPhone, which displays ""Charging is not supported with this accessory."" Completely useless."
3,Good to see him Back!!!!!,It is good to see Michael English back doing what he does best---Christian music!!! The tape offers fans some of Michael's best loved classics like Midnight Cry and I Bowed on My Knees. He also offers some variations of good ole gospel songs such as Blessed Assurance! Welcome Back Michael! You are great!
2,not real gospel,"I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN I BOUGHT THIS CD. I WAS REALLY LOOKING FOR SOME OLD SOUTHERN GOSPEL SOUNDS - MICHAEL ENGLISH IS AN AWESOME SOUTHERN GOSPEL SINGER - BUT THESE SONGS HAVE ALL BEEN ""REMIXED"" AND MADE TO SOUND JAZZY. HIS VOICE IS GREAT, AND IF YOU LIKE THE SOUND, YOU MIGHT LIKE THE CD. BUT, DON'T BUY IT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOUTHERN GOSPEL."
5,The music on this CD is awsome. I play it in my car when traveling or at home when I need a lift.,This is absolutely a CD that I would recommend to anybody. Michael's music is not limited to any age group. It is something that any age person will appreciate.
5,One of the best I've heard...Ever,"Michael English' ""Gospel"" is one of the best albums of this type of music I have ever heard. I've owned this album for a couple of years now and have played it over and over in my house and car. This album moves me to joyful tears every time I listen to it. The love of God shines through Michael's music and touches my heart. Thank You Michael."
5,Heaven sent!,"This is my favorite of the Michael English's CDs. All are wonderful but his versions of the songs on Gospel soothe the spirit. Midnight Cry, John the Revelator, and I Bowed On My Knees are truly heaven sent. His talent knows no limit."
3,Wasn't familiar enough with his music; was searching for a particular song by any artist,I would have preferred to have found the song I was looking for by a different artist but was unable to. Am not a particular fan of Michael English.
4,Actually pretty cute,"My girls actually like this doll a great deal...of course, I didn't tell them she was supposed to be ""mom"" I told them she was the park ranger! They love it, and she drops by the campsite to help our family out as they go on picnics and hikes, and tells the family about the wildlife."
5,NOT a water bottle in her thigh--it's a flashlight in her pocket!,"The product description explains that Mom never leaves the campsite without her flashlight in case it gets dark before she gets back. I'd say that makes for a great lesson, rather than leaving kids confused about why the lady won't put the 'water bottle' down, as complained by another reviewer here. This toy deserves 5 stars."
3,Great for a toddler with a sibling on the way,"This book has incredible illustrations. They are what make the book worth noting. The animals are drawn from unusual perspectives. The horse looms over you (hard to do in a book, I'll admit!), the sparrow perches rather in your face. Small children--even tiny children--will be able to enjoy this book because of the pictures. The story is about a new baby that has arrived on a farmstead--that is what the bird heard. The rhyming text is sweet but predictable. This would be a great book for a toddler with a sibling on the way. (I know my toddler was hoping for one after we read this.) Note, however, that it is a simple book, probably best enjoyed by the under-four crowd."
5,Wonderful Children's Book,"My 2 year old daughter loves this book. She knows every word! Every night before bed, she say's ""Bird Book?"" and we read it together. The illustrations are GORGEOUS, and the story and just happy and sweet. We had this book about a year ago and recently left it behind while on vacation in Florida, so I ordered a new one from Amazon because she couldn't do without it! All in all, a wonderful children's book!"
3,lift the car,"The jack does the job required of it, infinitely easier than a scissor jack but a bit of a nuisance to fit the handle in and out of the holder. It is difficult to control the release of air for a slow descent of the jack and the paint was coming off before the first 30 minutes of usage BUT it does lift the car and after a few weeks of use continues to work as well as it did on day 1 and that is all that really matters."
5,Hard-headed habits for commercial success,"This is one of those rare business books that has changed both my thinking and my behavior. It is particularly valuable for the lean organization that takes pride in its ability to make quick decisions. Mr. Eiben cogently supports the maxim that ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"", particularly in the complex, litigious world we operate in today. Buy it, read it, distribute it to your associates and take its lessons to heart."
4,Wonderful Book!,"I have read many books in the Wizard of 4th Street series, and find this one to contain the same wonderful humor and seriousness that is prevelant through the whole series. My only complaint with this book is that it seems to start a little slow. Maybe the slowness was part of the plot device, but overall, I felt this took away from the book. The ending, though not completely surprising, has a few twists one would never expect. Again, overall a really wonderful book, following in the footsteps of the rest of the series..."
2,"Cold, heartless, and utterly without a moral center","Compared to this book, The Last Of The Just is a walk in the (literary) park. The author is so icily removed from his observations that it is impossible to separate him from the monstrous Germans he describes. There is not one moment in this book in which the man who wrote it exhibits even the slightest humanity; he is a camera, cold, heartless and utterly without a moral center."
1,The DVD is completely un-viewable. Zero Star. It should not have been sold at all.,"The DVD is completely un-viewable. Zero Star. It should not have been sold at all.The picture is always in zoom mode. As a result, I could see only the faces of the actors when they're fighting or shooting! The picture is blurry. The sound is noisy. I could hardly hear them talking.I felt I was cheated."
1,DVDisaster,"Dreadful DVD presentation by 905 Entertainment/Trinity Entertainment. Opening credits are ""squeezed"" (tall and skinny people), then switches to pan and scan mode for the remainder of the film. Actors are often off-screen, out of focus, cut in half, etc. Don't bother."
2,Adios Amigos/Poor DVD quality!,"We received DVD in perfect condition, however the quality was very poor. No problems with purchase, seller, or packaging."
1,Do not buy!,This was a surprisingly terrible movie. You would think with Richard Pryor and Fred Williamson it would be a decent movie but this was the total opposite. It made no sense and the acting was terrible! I wanted to give it 0 stars but the system wouldn't allow me to! Stay away!
2,B-1,"Kind of grainy on picture. I guess expected due to the time period. Richard Pyror at his funniest though to me did not mix well with The Hammer's tough guy image. Good funny western to pass away the time. Good collection piece for 70""s collectors like myself."
3,"It's thick, and it works-mostly","It works, I use it to connect a PS3 to an LCD monitor. The problem is the signal cuts out once in a while and the monitor doesn't receive a strong enough signal to keep a picture on the screen. I don't know if it's because the PS3 doesn't push a strong enough signal, or the monitor squelches too high, but it really sucks in the middle of CoD WaW."
2,Not good for 1080P signals...,"Bought this cable specifically to run between an HDTV (a 46"" Samsung) and an upconverting DVD player (a Toshiba DVD recorder). After installation, the signal sent from the DVD player (a regular DVD upconverted to 1080P) was displaying static noise all over the place. Rechecked connections to make sure everything was plugged in correctly, but nothing helped. On a hunch, I set the DVD player to send a 1080i signal to the HDTV: no more static. Researching online, I found other people had the same problem with other cables from other companies: their problems were solved when they replaced their cheaper HDMI cables with more expensive ones. Since my HDTV also upconverts to 1080P, I ended up letting the DVD player upconvert only to 1080i, but this is not what I was expecting to do when purchasing this cable, and there is no reason why this cable should not be able to carry a 1080P signal."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this cable a couple months ago in preparation for wall mounting my TV. I didn't test the cable before spending the time to fish it the 25 feet from where my TV is to where I had placed my cable box - that was my mistake!!! After wasting all that time to run the cable I couldn't get a signal, then I ran a different cable I had laying around and had no problems at all, but this cable was to short to rerun behind the wall. I then had to go buy a new one that worked from a local store, and come to find out now that I'm passed the return period on this piece of junk...All in all I was very unhappy with all the time that was wasted, not to mention the money! Thought I was getting a good cable at a great price - NOPE. Don't know the problem, don't really care, I will NOT buy this cable the next time."
3,"Item good, shipping SLOW",The 30ft HDMI cable is perfectly fine. The shipping took an excruciatingly long time.
5,Cable works great for me!,"I use this cable to run from my video card on my pc to the Hdmi input on my big screen in the adjacent room to play movies. I haven't noticed any loss of picture quality like other have stated, everything is working fine for me. As for the quality, I have definitely seen cheaper and I have also seen better. For the price on this cable I think it's a steal. My local computer store wanted $55 for the same exact thing."
2,No audio and terrible picture,I ordered this cable simply because of the price. There were black bars appearing on the screen every few seconds and there was no audio. I tested it out on multiple components and the problem persisted. Please be cautious when ordering this cable. I ended up returning the item.
1,Worthless Paperweight,"I tried to use this hdmi cable for my home theater system. And it did not work. There must be a ton of resistance in this cable because the signal does not get transferred properly and it stops sending signal immediately after power up. I didn't believe the other negative reviewers. Trust me, don't buy this cable. Find another one."
2,Editorial mistake on holiday name,"I skimmed the book this weekend and was somewhat disappointed in the collection. I don't find anything that truly connects the stories. But my biggest complaint about the book is with one story by R. Craft. The original story, as mentioned in the acknowledgements, is entitled ""Tu B'shvat in Puddlewick,"" but the editors of this volume changed the title to ""Tisha B'av in Puddlewick."" This story is clearly connected to Tu B'shvat. The only thing the two holidays have in common is the first letter of the holiday. I do hope the editors pull this edition and make corrections."
1,For the Price and not for the Content,I am as big a fan of Frasier as one can be - I own all eight seasons (1-7 and final) in dvd. My rating is based on the price associated with this dvd pack - please do the simple math. It is possible to pick up all the seasons of Frasier at Amazon.com for a lot cheaper if you buy them separately. I simply do not understand this extra cost associated with buying the set - are we becoming so lazy that we are willing to pay a premium in excess of US$ 30 to buy the set together instead of going through the trouble(!) to buy them separately? And once again from the same vendor (i.e. Amazon.com).As for the series it is one of the wittiest shows on TV and is strongly recommended.
1,Cheaper when purchased by separarely!!,"I just bought each season on AMAZON (1-7) separately, ordered at the same time, opted for FREE SHIPPING, and my total was $181.31. Do the math! I saved $88.68. Let's not get too lazy, shall we?"
3,"Not too bad, but not the best.","This is the least memorable Velvet Acid Christ album. It isn't that it's poorly done. There just isn't anything outstanding enough to make an impression. It's also a lot more impersonal than previous albums and seems to take influence from ambient and noise- now, i'm into that kind of thing, but it's just not effective here. On the bright side, Bryan does seem to know how to place his samples better- they aren't nearly as distracting as they have been in the past. Highlights for me were ""Haunted"" and ""Collapsed."""
2,Not as good as older VAC,"The fist 6 tracks on this new album sound like left over cuts from TTG. The music is too trancy and there's too much synth.If you liked older VAC albums like Fun with Knives and Calling Ov the Dead, but not groups like VNV Nation, you might want to stay away from this one."
2,Just a pile of distortion and the same creepy vocals,"I have been a fan of VAC for some time. Their last few albums have been great. This latest CD seems very difficult to listen to as it just sounds like they went overboard with the distortion. The combined exhausting vocals that try so hard to be dark and scary, but are so overdone, end up sounding like static no matter what volume or settings I listen to it at. Shamefully, only one or two songs on this CD stood out to me, compared to their earlier works that all sounded pretty good. The rest just fades away into a noisy hodgepodge of screeching garbage. The vocals are unintelligible, which isn't such a big deal (who pays attention to the words anyway with this music) but the echo effect and guttural ranting gets old way too fast. Add so much distorted noise that you can barely appreciate what music lies beneath the mess, you get a CD that sounds damaged when in fact it is just the noise you just paid for."
4,GOOD AUTHOR,"I HAVE READ OTHERS BOOKS FROM THIS AUTHOR ON PARANORMAL ETC.... GOOD BOOK, BUT THE ONLY COMPLAINT A LITTLE BIT OF SKIPPING AROUND. LARGE THICK BOOK"
4,Excellent reference source for UFO information.,The UFO Book provides a lot of information about the most noteworthy UFO incidents. It is easy to look up any particular incident. It provides concise information to answer most questions and compare with other incidents. And most entries contain references for further study. Anyone from serious ufologists to the simply curious should have this reference book handy to get the facts.
5,Covers a lot of ground,Outstanding effort by Clark as usual. Very detailed accounts and many sightings that I have never heard of. His research was outstanding and well written. I find that I keep rereading this one.
2,Short Video,"This video is only a half hour long and is too short for any real instruction. Her second video ""Watercolor techniques for everyone"" contains this same footage! Not very useful, it plugs a certain brand name a lot and is actually taken from a PBS show. Save your money."
4,Classic Swedish Metal,This is one of the 3 classic melodic death metal releases of the mid 90's (along with The Jester Race by In Flames and Slaughter of the Soul by At The Gates) The Gallery never quite recieved the same level of fame as the other two but it may possibly be the most ambitious of them all. All the tracks are are very well done and contain many different parts. There is endless amounts of time changes to keep you on your feet and plenty of melody to keep things listenable (and interesting). Mikeal Stane's growl is very menacing but still not too grating on the ears. This combined with the intense speed makes this album a fairly brutul sounding one. Fans of the genre or the band must own this album as it is a classic that still holds up today against the newer releases. 4.5 of 5
1,How about some real evidence?,"This is another in the long line of books and articles claiming that mental illnesses are largely genetic. This claim is made despite the fact that not a single gene has been found to be linked to a mental disorder (at least not one that wasn't refuted a few years later). I guess the idea is to put out a bunch of studies making claims and, by the time the studies are refuted, you can crank out some new ones. My favorite passage in this book goes as follows: ""Recent linkage analysis studies have replicated initial reports of positive linkage to chromosome 6 markers in families with schizophrenia. Although there are several negative studies, the evidence implicating the short arm of chromosome 6 is the strongest to date for schizophrenia."" ""Several negative studies""? That sounds quite uncompelling to me. If you are going to assert that mental illnesses are genetic and human beings can be reduced to genetic robots..."
5,It worked at PolyOne Corp.,We used the ideas and processes outlined in this book at PolyOne Corporation with great success.
2,"Clunky interface, missing features, European sounds","I'm not familiar with other computer based Spanish-English dictionaries with audio pronuncaiation, or even if there are any. This one is OK if all you want to do is look up words on the computer instead of in a printed dictionary and get some clue about how they're pronounced. But, the controls are mystifying, the help function doesn't, the pronunciation is Castilian for the Spanish and British for the English, and the games don't have all the features the intro movie so breezily shows - like, the option to select the crossword puzzle vocabulary from a restricted list of words. I happened to buy this used and cheap and am content - I got what I paid for, I suppose - but don't have high expectations of either its features or its ease of use."
3,nutrition info doesn't add up,"I love this cocoa, but if you're counting calories be aware that the nutrition info on the label (which you can view near the top of the product page) is a fairy tale.A single serving (1 tablespoon, 5g) is listed as 10 calories yet contains 1g of fat, 2g of carbs, and 4g of protein (which comes to 7g and 33 calories, not 5g and 10 calories). So something, somewhere has to give.I looked up this exact same product on the Saco site and they post different numbers (1g fat, 3g carb, 1g protein) which at least add up correctly on weight, but they don't include calorie information (which should be 25 calories if the nutrition information is accurate).As I consume vast quantities of this powder in a low-carb diet, understating the calories by a factor of three or more is not a minor issue.I'll keep using it, but with muted zeal."
3,"Not bad, just different",We made chocolate sauce and hot cocoa and noticed a real difference in the flavor from the Hershey's cocoa we're used to. It might be described as milder or subtler or just different. It's non returnable so try it first. If you want Hershey's cocoa flavor this is not the cocoa for you.
3,Not Hershey's cocoa,If you are used to dutched cocoa (or you don't know the difference between cocoa processes) you may want to try a single container before ordering the 12 pack. The taste of this blend is a little unusual compared to the Hershey's cocoa and other brands I have tried.
4,"Love this cocoa, not the price","I only use Saco cocoa because it's amazing, but I don't know what going on with the price. It's almost doubled over the past 3 years or so on Amazon. Wish I still lived in New York where, as of now, I'm betting it's cheaper to buy in store (Yonkers Super Stop And Shop carried it). Unfortunately, my local stores here in northern California dont carry it. Bummer."
4,I like this stuff,"I do like this cocoa for baking! I have bought it at the grocery store, but the price on Amazon is better. I know that it would take a while to go through TWELVE containers of this cocoa, but I also know my family and neighbors would approve of a greater supply of homemade brownies!"
2,poor packaging,"The packaging is horrible and several containers were damaged in shipping and open slightly. I'm sure the cocoa is good, but haven't tried it yet.Terry"
1,the identification of Lace,I wish I had not spent the money on this book. poor investment. I rarely use it . I sell vintage textiles on ebay and this was of little help in identifying items I sell. photos are not helpful. Can not recommend this one.
5,Dvorak at his best,Orchestral works are phenomenal -- Dvorak is one of the best kept secrets among the Great Composers. My daughter is the musical expert in the family and rates this product 5/5 !
5,Excellent book,"I enjoyed reading this book. The author compiled notes, diaries, and letters that he kept from battles in the Pacific during World War II. He also utilized the same sources from friends and colleagues to give their points of view of the battles they fought in. It is quite interesting to me that he waited so long before he actually wrote the book. I enjoyed the book so much that I bought another copy for a friend."
2,Yawn.,"I did not find this book to be interesting at all. As an adult MSW student with an MBA, I was expecting more from this book regarding current policies."
4,The Cd is okay...,"I can't really rave about this Cd, but I can't really say it's that bad either. On most of the songs the blended voices sound good; on others, when the bass singer and one of the male lead singers (the one with the raspy voice) are featured, they exposed themselves as being a little ""weak"". Again, when the voices were blended, they were fine."
2,"Good as a reference, Look elsewhere if you're a beginner",While the book is good for referencing topics when you already know PowerBuilder. You might find yourself lost if you're starting out and trying to follow the example from the book. There are points where the figures in the book don't match where you are at that point in the code. Not to mention the fact that the code that you can download is different then the code descibed in the book. Definetly not a book to learn PowerBuilder from.
1,Clear and Step-by-Step THIS.,"This was the textbook chosen by my educational institute to introduce us to PowerBuilder and Object-Oriented Fundamentals. I'd have to say it fails on each of those counts.You're not introduced to PowerScript until nearly halfway through the book, the code is NOT laid out in a step-by-step fashion AT ALL after the first chapter or so (and even then), there are coding errors all over the place, and the finished product that you can download has all sorts of inconsistencies with what's in the book (it's as though they kept the application the same from PowerBuilder 5 and never bothered to check the new text against it or something).I'm in the process right now of trying to reverse engineer the example from Que's website and compare my own to figure out what snippets the book has omitted that are preventing my application from functioning properly. Thank you, William Heys, for depriving me of some much-needed sleep. :P~"
4,Its a good book but it takes a while to get through it,"Its a very good book but I don't think it targets beginners as much as it claims to. There is a tutorial that runs through the book but it doesn't give concise instructions of the steps one should follow. If these were clearly indicated I would give the book 5/5. I feel that one should know a little about Powerbuilder before attempting to approach this book. However it is so detailed that it takes a while to complete, this can be percieved as a good or a bad thing."
4,Good book for object-oriented developers,"For someone who just wants to learn the PowerBuilder painters, the other books are fine. The strength of this book is that it teaches you to build in PowerBuilder the RIGHT way...by building in an object-oriented way. Most new PowerBuilder developers know just enough to shoot themselves in the foot. This book takes more effort, but its examples are much closer to real development than the other intro books I have reviewed."
1,Very disappointing.,I feel I have to disagree with the other reviewers - I bought this book and learned very little from it. It requires trudging through hundreds of pages before you even learn the basics. I know many others who have had similar experiences with this book - it was 'recommended reading' on a PowerBuilder course I took. My advice? Buy Official PowerBuilder Fundamentals - it's head and shoulders above Que's offering.
5,Excellent Review and a real benefit for practical work,"This is the first powerbuilder book, I read that seems to be not only a compendium but delivers as well many pratical nice choosen examples. On the first look, you got the impression that this is only an adapted book to the next version, but if you really take a look you will remark many details which are carefully done. I recommend that book to all newcomers to powerbuilder as well as a to experienced developers. The index is very well done."
5,Unique,"I really enjoy these bibs. At first I was skeptical of their fleece-like front, but it really helps catching food. The lack of a plastic lining in the back also makes washing a breeze and I haven't had any leak throughs yet!"
3,Great live band but a the vidoeo was almost was amiture.,"Gene Loves Jezabel was one of the bands that did not get the recognition they deserved as they had progressed with each album they had put out. This video captures what great musicians they truely are! Definatly check out Amazon's cd selections on this band because the availability is unreal, plus each of this bands's cd's are awsome!"
1,NEVER RECEIVED CD,"How can I review something I paid for and never received. I was anxiouly awaiting to receive this cd because I really enjoy listening to DuDu Fisher's music. He has an outstanding voice...a real showman for his Showstoppers cd. Why should anyone pay for something and not receive it. I will never order anything from that company and I hope Amazon forbids them to even offer products to the public because if you read other reviews, I am not the only one that did not receive their orders."
5,Time to buy this,"A great American writer once declared that a large part of what makes good writing is its possessing the intangible quality of being able to reach out to its audience and teach them how to read that particular piece of writing. The idea being that as one discovers a work, the work simultaneously informs the reader how best to go about that discovery. It's an interesting aesthetic, and one that the songs on The Great Depression's new album, Unconscious Pilot, manages to achieve almost effortlessly without exception.Each track here is patient and deliberate, drifting through dreamy soundscapes filled with pianos, organs, percussion, and unbelievably warm-toned guitars that together reveal each song's well-defined though somehow still understated individuality. By the end of each track, one is left with a very clear impression of a feeling, an image, or a scenario that is separated but not entirely divorced from the rest of the record."
3,Why did daddy die?,"The book was helpful, but kind of depressing. I mean what can you do for the family when Daddy dies suddenly? I was glad we read it, though. It is written with a Jewish outlook on life and death."
5,Much needed for every family library!,My mother wrote this book when she was looking for things to help her cope with the death of her husband and teach her children about grief and death. There was and is surprisingly little available. She is raw and vulnerable while being informative about the stages of grief and the reality of the process. She includes stories which make it real and help us to know that we are not alone in our pain. This is a valuable source for anyone who has had a death in their family.
2,Misleading,"While it contains a couple good nuggets of information, most of it is a (very) basic and simple overview of each form in very unnecessary, extravagant wording"
3,Good book with minor damage.,"Item arrived later than expected and the base of the spine was destroyed, which I wasn't expecting when I ordered it new.The cover and pages were in acceptable condition. Appeared used.Reasonably priced.Would make another purchase from distributor assuming slightly damaged product was a rarity."
5,Wild Woman of the Sky,"What I was asking myself upon reading this book is: How is it that I had not heard of Pancho Barnes before? I am so glad this book fell into my lap! I was rivet by her story from page one. She outflew Amelia Earhart, outdrank the Mexican Army, and partied with the likes of Jimmy Doolittle and Chuck Yaeger (ya know the test pilot that broke the sound barrier). She flew as a stunt pilot in movies. She new all the Hollywood people and was responsible for quite a few successful careers. You know John Wayne? Well so did Pancho. She lived wild and created her own rules for living. You won't believe this story. What ever happened to Pancho Barnes?"
2,much ado about little,"The book was too long. Too much focus on Pancho's early life of wealth and privilege. Her foul-mouthed later years swiftly become a bore. Sure, she tried to ""cuddle"" the likes of Chuck Yeager and Bob Hoover and other test pilots but this narrative door closes in a powerful downdraft of silly information. Would have made an interesting 50-page book. Better luck next time, Pancho."
3,Almost completely plastic,"First, this part is bigger than it looks in the picture. It sticks out 4.5 inches from the wall and is almost 3 inches wide.Second, the only metal is a small 90 degree elbow pipe connection from the wall to the hose (hose not included). Everything else is plastic. That said, the plastic feels substantial and the outer shell appears to have a thick plating of chrome. I don't know how long the finish will last.If you were hoping for a solid brass fixture, look somewhere else. I think it looks OK, so I will be keeping it."
4,Extraordinary Period Piece,"My wife and I truly enjoyed this film. The plot is marvelous and the story told with flair and artistic grace. The attention to detail, from the sets to the costumes and the historical accuracy are enlightening. I would watch this film over and over; it is that good."
5,Not Just a Chick Flick!,"I originally saw this movie in Paris under the title ""The Courtesan"". The scenery and the costuming are absolutely breath taking, and I thought Catherine McCormick did a wonderful job in the role of Veronica Franco. This movie does an incredible job of showing just how few opportunities there were for women in this time period and the only options available should a woman want an education of any kind. I do not know yet how accurate this true story is in portraying the life of Veronica Franco, but seeing this movie made me interested enough to purchase and begin to read the book upon which it is based (The Honest Courtesan). This movie is definitely worth the purchase......."
4,Dangerous Beauty,"Picturesque, moving, romantic and humorous at the same time. A total chick flick with just enough bawdiness to keep it from being completely estrogen laden."
1,Extremely boring,We usually love romance films but this gotta be one of the worst we've ever seen. It's extremely slow and boring and predictable.
3,XVI th CENTURY VENICE (HOLLYWOOD STYLE),"Two scenes will save DANGEROUS BEAUTY from total oblivion : the "" poems and sword "" duel between Veronica Franco and Maffio Venier and also Catherine McCormack interpretation of the venetian courtesan during her trial.DANGEROUS BEAUTY is photographed in the Ridley Scott manner and every detail has been so well taken care of that even the corpses of the victims of the plague seem to shine. So do not wait for a history lesson with this movie. The Venice of Fellini's CASANOVA can give you a more accurate vision of this city.In fact, Catherine McCormack's interpretation is the only reason why I've watched this movie until the end. She's really ""in"" the character and looks truly possessed by poetic inspiration.A postcard DVD."
5,Excellent,I can't be more happy than I am with Amazon services. I have both Dangerous Beauty DVD and a watch Seiko SNA 061 in excellent condition (and very cheap).:)
3,Beautiful Sets & Costumes - Lacking Depth,"I really wanted to like this movie. It was beautifully filmed, with sumptuous costumes (though a lot of the Venice scenes were obviously on sets -- the water was so clean!). Overall, I felt that the movie lacked real depth - and I imagine the book was a lot better.It was your basic enjoyable happy ending Hollywood produced historical costume drama. A pleasant way to spend an evening, a few laughs over bad overacting, some titillating nudity (naked bodies, female breasts but no male genitalia and nothing more than PG-13). It could have been so much more!"
5,Dangerous,The first time I saw this movie I fell in love with it! Have been searching for it for years and glad to have found it on Amazon.It is a very intertaining love story based on true events.
3,"Rent it, don't buy it","Movie grips you right from the start. Highly recommended to watch once, but don't waste your money on purchasing it!"
2,Destroyed my faith in the Amazon review system,"This is a made for tv low budget film that is enormously predictable and with mediocre acting at its best. It was my night to pick the movie and my husband said he will never forgive me for this one. Can't say I blame him, but I'm impressed that he cast came together to review the movie so highly on Amazon - higher than most Oscar winning movies! Very sneaky, fellow raters. Very sneaky."
3,THE DANGER OF A LITTLE BEAUTY IS...,"...That beauty is sometimes all you get.Where is the substance?Amazon has been recommending this movie to me for a while, and while the bananna thing will win this movie some fans, I think this film is much more up the alley of my wife than me. Still, Caterine McCormack is a revelation. And its interesting to watch Naomi Watts trying not to be beautiful.It bugs me that I found no one to root for in this movie.I end up feeling like the jerk from the inquisition--let Venice deal with Venice. For all of its--and Miss McCormack's (by the way, its nice to see this lady not getting her throat slashed every once in a while) and yes, the inimitable Miss Watts's beauty--I recommend passing this movie by.Shakespeare In Love and Elizabeth both do the same basic job as this movie and they do it in a much, much better fashion."
1,I would have given this movie negative stars if I could have,"I just got through watching this movie for my Italian class, and I just have to say that one would have to be a complete idiot to like this film. This, after ""Stealing Beauty"" is possibly the worst film I've ever seen. I'd recommend putting a bullet in your head before watching this cheesy, overdone, trite, and absolutely awful movie."
2,Great Disappointment,"I read the reviews and thought this would be a good one. However, I was left very disappointed.The cast is great. The acting is good. The set and costumes are beautiful. It's the writing that ruins the movie. The story had so much potential but unfortunately, they `Hollywoodized' it too much. I found the movie to be too cheesy and sugar coated to be enjoyable.If you are looking for nothing more than a high production soft porn, this will suit you fine. If you want something with more substance, I would recommend The Last King - The Power and the Passion of Charles II. It is truly one of Rufus Sewell's finest performances. The Last King is everything that Dangerous Beauty is not."
5,Fast shipping,The shipping was fast and I got it within a few days of purchase. Thanks for having such a great movie in stock.
1,Unrealistic,"This movie claims to be based on a true story, but anyone with half a brain will quickly identify the unrealistic parts. Some in the scenery, some in the costumes, but most obviously in the overall portrayal of prostitution as being an envious way of life."
5,A PERIOD PIECE AT IT'S BEST,"This is one of those movies that 'sticks with you'. Of course Catherine McCormick was excellent in the role of Veronoca Franco but what about Rufus Sewell who played Marco? I think we'll definetly be seeing more of him, that voice would make you melt. If you're looking for romance, humour, spectacular scenery and costumes this is the movie for you."
5,The truth will out...,"Entertaining, funny, dramatic and touching. I really enjoyed the movie and will recommend to friends. I always enjoy when I'm able to learn something new. A courtesean's life was similiar to a Geisha girl in Japan. The women are gifted in the art of seduction, music, dancing, singing and conversation. One of the benefits that this life afforded them was education. Courteseans also enjoyed much more freedom than society allowed the majority of most women. Of course the price for education and freedom was the sacrifice of safety and protection that marriage would have provided them. A good quote from the movie, ""My cage might be bigger than yours, but it's still a cage."" (Courtesean to married woman) The end of the movie that involves the Inquisition was a surprise. You'll have to see it to find out. Oh, and it's a true story!"
2,"Beautiful costumes and scenery, that's all.","This film is set in such an aesthetically pleasing era, of course it is beautiful. The costumes are very well done. The acting is very decent, but I was so distracted by the whole premise ""sexual promiscuity=freedom"". Historically, women were treated unfairly; I still think the heroin's ""profession"" is incredibly demeaning. The whole ""love need not heed any rules or morals"" doesn't work for me in a story. I understand this is all meant in a certain historical context, but because of it, I have no love for the heroin of this story. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone...unless you enjoy softcore porn."
5,"Inspiring, beautiful, well produced and acted - loved it!","I've watched my videotape 3-4 times so far. The poorly chosen title may account for it's not being well known, but the story -- based on real people -- set, costumes, casting, acting, production were also terrific. Oh, the music is lovely, too. I found the heroine very inspiring. I'm puzzled by those who thought this was fluff -- standing up for truth and personal and religious freedom against enormous odds is far from fluff. Catherine McCormack is very talented, and Rufus Sewell is gorgeous to look at! Decent acting, too. Oliver what's his name was terrific. I've seen the movie advertised on cable TV here in Japan under a new title, A Destiny of Her Own (plus a separate Japanese title). Too bad they didn't come up with this or better the first time around."
5,A beautiful drama,"""Dangerous Beauty"" is a beautiful period piece based on a non-fiction book. The movie is set in 16th century Venice. Veronica falls in love with Marco, but Marco comes from a rich family. Veronica's mother advises her that she should become a courtesan so that she can spend time with Marco. Veronica does so well at the courtesan business that she becomes a favorite of all the men in the city. Later she becomes the target of an inquisition by the Church for witchcraft. A beautiful story about how women survive in society."
3,Entertaining fluff,"The scenery is gorgeous, the sets and clothing lush, and the cinematography superb. Plus, the enigmatic Rufus Sewell as the leading man (and Catherine McCormack is not that bad either). The story, though, is another issue... It starts in a good note, but by the time Rufus leaves for the war in Cyprus, the plot thickens and goes downhill on its weight. It lost my interest. I did enjoy, though, the always reliable Moira Kelly (who should have had more screentime), and was amused by how little we saw of Melina Kanakaredes, Sid of NBC's Providence (I actually had to rewind to her scenes after reading in the credits which character she played!). Harmless fun, with a great cast. Don't expect more than that, though."
2,Dangerous Beauty DVD,"I have bought Dangerous Beauty before and the quality has always been excellent. This time the product looked as though it had been taped from the original, fuzzy, light in value and not up to Amazons great reputation."
4,interesting i think,i lked t. and at the end was effected.Also at frst ddnt expect such an end lke t but when it finished i was really effected. I felt different things when left there.And suggested everybody (that i know )to see it.
3,I liked the original version better than the edited one Amazon offers,"I am disappointed in Amazon's edited version of the movie. I saw this movie in it's original version, and I really liked it. If you see Amazon's edited version and you're like ""meh"", try to see the original, unedited version. It's more detailed, there is more meat to the story, and it makes more sense. The original version is a little more graphic, so for those sensitive to violence, sex or perversion scenes you may want to skip it, but it gives more details about the heroine's relationship with her friend, her conversion from girl to courtesan, her wit and intelligence at court, and her relationships with others. It tells a far better story than the one Amazon offers on instant video."
4,Worth your time,"This is my mom's favorite movie, and I can see why. It's a romance that doesn't make you cringe. This is saying a lot from someone who usually can't stand romance films. In the film, we have the love story but the characters are not so simple, nor are their situations. I really got involved in the movie, and am able to watch it over and over again.One thing that confused me was that when I first saw this exact film, it was called ""A Destiny of Her Own."" On another website it was called ""The Honest Courtesan,"" which is the name of a book about Veronica DeFranco. Whatever you want to call the film, just make sure you watch it!"
4,Great movie for strong independent women!,"It is one of those movies that helps you remember the strength, intelligence and power of being a woman!"
3,CATHERINE THE GREAT,"CATHERINE McCORMACK is one of today's most beautiful actresses ,but left alone she can't all by herself save this film from sinking after a good start.The story is told like a fairy tale ,and that really disturbed me a lot.This is the kind of film we would like to like more ,but we are stuck with the evidence that it could have been better.The director seems unable to balance the screenplay in it's continuity.This however won't prevent me from seeing all upcomming CATHERINE McCORMACK movies, because i am a fan eversince i saw BRAVEHEART."
5,"History, Beauty, Love","I've deeply enjoyed this movie; watching it was like a journey back in time. It depicts Venice in the 1500's and gives you a glimpse of the life people had back then. It made me contemplate the life we have today and how much different everything was back 500 years ago. As opposed to most movies today, which are extremely predictable, this one was full of suspense.I highly recommend it to anyone.Btw, Veronica (the main female character) has a distinct beauty. After the movie ended I googled her. Wow, I couldn't believe how much she's aged. It is amazing how some people still look the same after many years, yet others look nothing like they used to. Anyway, go watch the movie. :))"
5,STICK MASSAGER,"IT ARRIVED PROMPTLY IN GREAT CONDITION :0) TRIED IT RIGHT AWAY & LOVED IT. GREAT MORE FOR STIMULATION RATHER THAN PENATRATION AS IT IS MORE ON THE SLENDER SIDE, BUT VERY DURABLE & WORKS EXCELLENT IN WATER"
3,No Photographs,"Since I got this book for next to nothing, I'm going to be generous and give it three stars. First, I have to agree with the other reviewer who said that this book is full of instructions for treats that most everyone already knows how to make: floats, cones, sundaes, parfaits, ice pops. You'll be 71 pages into the thing before the recipes for the ice cream tarts, bombes, etc. make an appearance. The thing that bothers me the most is, there are NO PHOTOGRAPHS in the book, not one! Enjoy the front and back covers, because those are the only photos you get. That is, imo, an absolute crime in a dessert book."
5,Dessert helper for Bachelors,This is a great book for men who want to prepare a romantic dinner for their women. I'm great with the appetizers and main course but have always depended on a gallon of ice-cream for dessert. I'm a man who has little interest in baking. Dressing-up ice-cream is really the way to go... because it's easy but it shows you care. Thank you Lori!
2,Not worth the money,"I was unpleasantly surprised to find that this book is a collection of the author's recipes. Might be my bad for assuming that there would be more IceCream Cake ideas. Most of the ""ideas"" are things that you could come up with on your own with a little imagination. Verdict: Don't waste the bucks unless you want a step-by-step on how to scoop ice cream and make it look ""purty."""
2,"starts out fine, then gets loud","Seems to work, and is inexpensive. When it first starts, it makes a reasonably small amount of noise. You can hear the fan, but it's not too bad. I would be happy if that's all the noise it ever made. But after a half hour or so on my machine, it seems to perhaps warm up to the point where the fan speeds up to keep it cool. At that point it's pretty loud and even rattles a bit. Wish I'd bought something else."
5,The Scariest true crime story I've ever read.,"This story is incredible. Steven Nickle's attantion to detail in this story is great. He's made this the scariest story I've read. When I told my friends about this story of the Torso Killer, and they were scared out of their minds. So if you like a Thriller thats true then you shoul Read ""Torso: The story of Eliot Ness and the search for a Psycopathic Killer,"" by Steven Nickel."
3,"Good, but could be better","While this book is well written, I feel that as source material on the Torso Killer it leaves much to be desired. This book is more of Eliot Ness' personal and professional life than of the murders and investigations. For those who are looking for strictly the facts on the Torso case, this book is not the place to find it. As entertainment, the book is more than satisfactory."
2,TOO MUCH FILLER / NOT ENOUGH KILLER,"Header pretty much tells it.Ness comes across as a fairly dull individual.Could have done without quite a bit of the info on Cleveland.Book is gripping and a real pager-turner when the author stays with the slasher and his victims...alas, there isn't enough of it here. Also, what compounds the problem is that the butcher was never caught.So, what do you got? A John Gilmore SEVERED type of tale? Not quite, because John Gilmore is the superior writer and his book is a compelling read every step of the way (even though John Gilmore was not certain of who did Elizabeth Short in, either.)But hey, some scribes are born true-crime writers, some are not.I did say when the author of Torso stays with the bodycount and the ensuing manhunt the book is a scream--by that I mean it just might make your lunch back up."
5,yikes,"I've read a lot of true crime books, and this book is absolutely the creepiest among them. That the killer (who was never caught) is long since dead wasn't much comfort to me at bedtime. And to think he left a victim or two in my own city! If you like good creepy true crime accounts, I recommend this book without hesitation."
3,Well made but has a big flaw,I like scissor jacks because when you get stuck in the mud they can get under the frame without a lot of extra digging. I also use them in woodworking as a spreader and dis-assembler. This one is well made with a good action but the drive/crank shaft end attaches by a square drive and is held in place with a snap ring. This makes it easy to get in and out of the drive socket but also means that when you are cranking it pops out if you get even a little bit out of line. They seemed to be trying to engineer it as a universal joint for convenience but what they wound up with is not all all convenient.
4,Heavy duty jack,Heavy duty scissor jack. Appears to be very well made. Handle may be over done. I haven't put it under a car yet. But the big handle will either be great or clumsy.
5,Steinway & Sons,"This was a very interesting book. Very informative. It contained a lot of information germain to running a business, but it was never dry and was easy to read. It not only traced the history of the business, but detailed how society has evolved dramatically over the years. Read this book!!"
1,Bolts are to short!,"The bolts that came in the pack are to short to install on a common Schwinn mountain bike. They need to be about 1/4 inch longer to be useful. They must have been designed for a bike with a really thin frame. They also don't include a bolt to mount to the brake support. A new set of nuts and bolts aren't expensive to purchase, its just annoying that I have to make an extra trip to the hardware store to get what should have come standard in the pack. The only piece that is of any use is the bracket that attaches the bike rack to the brake post...which should come standard."
3,A little difficult to install,Material is of good quality. The screws were too big and short for the frame of my bike. It was not easily installed by yourself if you don't have the right tools
5,Saracen Knight and the Crusades,This is one of six Saracen Knights or Warriors made by Schleich. They are a great for collecting and play. It should be noted they are not retired by the company and will become hard to find soon.
2,"Oh, Well","I guess I can't blame Don Wilson. He probably needed the money and why not make a cheap cheesy flick or three. No where near any of Lee's films, or even Van Damme, Norris, Seagall, etc. Very average or bad acting even with Richard Roundtree in one film. Wilson lacks any beleivable emotional range and the fight scenes are overly choreographed and come off as slow and fake."
2,Get a professional to install,"I bought a Curt model 11771 from Discount Hitch for my 2007 BMW 328i wagon. After a great deal of unpleasant time under the car, I tried to get a professional to install it. One dealer wanted $185.00, the other wouldn't touch it. A friend in a body shop installed it for $30.00 and did a beautiful job. He had to ream two holes to make it fit and said that no one could do it without an air wrench. I saved about $80.00 compared to UHaul but it was barely worth it. I avoid UHaul at any cost because of past screwups."
3,Does NOT fit 328i E90 sedan,"Even though the ""make sure it fits"" widget on Amazon's page suggests this hitch will fit, it is NOT intended for the sedan and will NOT fit. The center bar that ties back to the chassis is shaped for the Touring and won't reach on the sedan. I returned the hitch with no problems.On the plus side, the hitch looked great, came with all the hardware and instructions, and would have been an easy install if it was made for my car."
3,11771 does not fit the 2006 BMW 330i,"There is an emissions sensor that would interfere with the 11771 receiver hitch on the 2006 BMW 330i. The BMW frame between the axle does not have an attachment point, the instructions show a hole in the frame with a screw that I was supposed to replace with a longer screw to attach the receiver. The receiver looks like it is great quality, the Curt Mfg website did not have the 330i as a compatible fit, only the 328i wagon and the 328xi all wheel BMW. Some websites claimed the hitch would fit a 330i, it doesn't. Check the Curt website for fit information before you buy the receiver.I sold the BMW and bought a Curt Hitch for a 2004 Toyota Tacoma, other than having to shave the tabs on the truck bumper rails, the installation was fairly simple. The trailer hitch is nice quality."
4,Question and Answer format is great,Rich in Colorado is all wet. This is an excellent resource book to prepare yourself for an interview. Deals with many difficult questions in an even-handed manner.
2,Not the original music,"I was expecting this to be the music from the movies - it isn't. It is nicely done, but if you're expecting the same style and sound as from the movies, look elsewhere (this sounds more MIDI than orchestra)."
5,Firedrake,"It is a really great book and i haven't read anything better in my life. I can't believe how good his books are and I can't stop reading them. I am constantly looking for other books written by him. I love the adventures and can't wait to see whats else is going to happen. I felt as if I was fighting right along side them, fighting the aweful Duke Toma. I cheared when they defeated many of the drake lords, and I wish i could have given Azran what he diserved myself. I love the ending, and I will keep reading more of his books. I recomend this book or any of his other books to anyone of anyage with any sort of imagination!"
1,Not compatible without cable/satellite,The biggest issue is that this is not compatible without cable/satellite. 'Tunerless' was an insufficient description for this. Had to return as I bought it for a relative who does not have cable/satellite. May be a bargain because so few can use it.
1,"Junk (or can I say ""crap"" in this review?)","The Missuz bought this unit for me as a christmas present last year, although I didn't need it, until I finally decided 6 months after to replace my cheapo memorex dvd player (which worked just fine, thank you very much) with this better branded (so I thought) combo unit. And guess what?The remote didn't work.Of course I tried fresh batteries... and another two on the outside chance one or both of those was defective... and PfOO-pppppp-ffft! Bupkiss. The over the shoulder ""take a hike"" thumb.Which leaves me with a product that works well enough with the limited controls on the body of the unit, so long as I fancy crawling back and forth across the carpet to it on my hands and knees... which, by the way, I don't."
1,Do Not Buy,"first of all this DVD/VCRplayer does not Repeat not have any Coaxial Cablehook ups and then just to make everything really interesting no, S-Video either and the way to record a show is bizarre to say the least, I only recommend this DVD/VCR combo if you are in to S/M, other wise go and buy another VCR/DVD combo"
2,Adoptability to older entertainment center,This item is not adoptable to older entertainment centers. It only gets input from a cable company's box and could not be hooked up directly to an antena.
1,Sony SLV-D380P,Received a Sony SLV-D380P yesterday from Amazon. DVD portion functions OK. VHS does not function at all. You get what you pay for. I do not endorse this product. Beware...Lyman Burk
3,"OK, But not what I expected","Cannot record on DVD. If you want to watch one program and record another program on VCR, you can't do that either. YOU MUST WATCH THE PROGRAM WHEN YOU RECORD. If I were to do it over again, I would make sure the tuner was compatable with the new digital broadcast rules."
1,No Tuner Equals No Sale,I can't reccomend any video recorders that don't bother to have a tuner in it. Why offer it if I can't record TV shows without a box?
5,Good Unit,I had one of these units before and this refurbased one has been just as good as a new one. The service was excellent and I recieved the item in a timely way.
4,just as expected,"I did a good amount of research before I chose this model. It is exactly as I expected. Anyone who can read will know that it DOES NOT have a tuner. It says so on the outside of the box as well as at least 3 places inside.I assume most people use a cable box so that shouldn't be an issue. Set up was easy. I plan to record TV so I did need to hook up an additional audio-video cable which was not supplied (also stated in specs.)After about 15 minutes, it was working. The DVD player and VHS both work fine. Based on reading reviews of other similar units, I am very confident I made the right decision. With a little searching, you can buy this unit for $90. I got mine at Walmart and it is also at Target. If you are looking for a good combination unit, I highly recommend this Sony."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"I intended to replace both my DVD and VHS player with one unit. I purchased the Sony D380P for that purpose. Unfortunately, I did not do adequate research to realize that this unit does not have a tuner. I cannot record TV programs without the assistance of my old VHS player. I program my old VHS unit to record TV shows. It defeats the purpose of my original intent."
5,SonySLV-D38OP,"This product was carefully packed, easily installed, and provides great viewing of our DVD's and videos."
1,No Tuner,"Despite the description of ""full-featured"" VCR, this unit does not have a tuner (so stated in the title of the unit.) This means you MUST have an external signal source if you wish to record TV programs. You cannot connect it directly to your basic cable service. If that's not a problem for you, then this may be an OK unit. But you can only watch TV thru it by having an external VCR, Cable Box or other unit capable of tuning a TV signal."
4,Does What It Says,"This DVD/VCR player does what it says it will. It plays DVDs and VCR tapes. It does not record, but it is only needed to play shows while I'm on the treadmill."
3,Sony DVD and VCR,"Works well except the ""ENTER"" botton on remote doesn't work. I haven't yet tried to record anything. Good price"
1,Poor amozon service,This product was sold as a special no shipping charge. When the item arrive I never took it out of the box as it was not what I wanted. I e mailed amazon for a return number and sent it back at a cost to me of 17.00. My Credit was less shipping of 13.91. When I inquired I was told by amazon that because I returned the item shipping to me was not free but charged. This was not metioned before I bought the item. POOR SERVICE AND MISLEADING INFORMATION. I will NEVER deal with Amazon again. Buyer beware
1,"Don""t buy refurbished unit","Maybe it was just my luck but I purchased a refurbished unit that was DOA. Sony did replace with another unit that started having problems after 3 1/2 month (over the 90 day warranty period). The problem was that I had barely used the unit (maybe 15 hour use of the VHS). The tape recording had white dots running across the entire picture.A new unit might be OK. But, Sony apparently doesn't do a very good job of refurbishing the units it puts back out for sale."
3,Not for the technologically challenged,"We bought this for my 75 year old mother to replace a VCR/DVD player that died. It came quickly and it works very well but setting up the remote took three people to figure out, one of whom teaches computer applications and two who are engineers. Once we got it programed it works great but getting there was something my mother could never have accomplished on her own. The designers forgot that not all users are technological whizzes."
3,Sony SLV-D380P review,Good product with nice features. My only problem is the DVD\VCR audio connectors in the back are loose so the sound goes in and out. I waited too long to try and exchange it. If that problem was fixed then I would have no complaints.
1,Bought 2 units - Both Garbage,"Shame on Sony for putting out such an inferior product. I have always been a Sony customer. And have many good Sony electronics; TV, Radio, Vaio computer. Good company / good name.So when I needed a 'good' DVD/VHS player for upstairs and out at the cottage I went with Sony. Yes its tunerless, yes you can only record one thing at a time, yes its their low end product line. But man its gotta at least work!Both units failed to deliver DVD functionality. Open/close operation is erratic. Tracking initiation is slow`and inaccurate. Skip forward is down-right psychotic. One monent the DVD side works, the next its sputtering. Both units - both psycho. Very irritating!I would expect this type of merchandise from some 'Gold Line' low line brand. But from Sony? Baloney!"
1,Lousy Product,this is a lousy dvd/vcr player. I have many single vcrs that would make this thing look like a scrap heap. This is not from sonys quality days. Everyone thinks sony can still make good stuff. But the truth is they dont care about there tape based products any more. if you call there customerservice it stinks. Dont buy this product i have personally used this one my self and it stinks big time. It makes the humming noise and plays tapes badly. I have other vcrs that are ultra silent even when rewinding i tried this one for another room and it was horrible.
5,Sony SLV-D380P DVD/VCR Tunerless Progressive Scan DVD/VHS Combo Player,"Highly reccommend. Works fine with my other components. Just remember this a ""tunerless"" DVD/VCR combo player."
3,Okay...,"It's ok for just watch movies or videos but not the best for recording any VHS, because it is tunerless."
