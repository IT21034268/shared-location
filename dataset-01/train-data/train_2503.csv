1,Just the facts Ma'am.,"I have passed four certifications and read 2 text books for each one. So I would just like to say- For God's sake don't buy this book! I have completed the book on 70-215. I gave this book one star because it may contain all the facts. However, this book has been written in the dryest most uninteresting way possible. The facts are not presented in a way that will help you in real life or to pass the exam. I think that there may be one sentence out of the 700 pages that may have been written by a human instead of a computer. If you like reading dictionaries, this book is for you. This book has no glossary of terms, then has terms in review questions that are not in the index.I think the database computer that wrote this book totally lost sight of the fact that this book is supposed to help you learn the subject matter, not test you on it.I will stick with Sybex and Osborne from now on. The Passport books are also excellent."
2,Incomplete. Use this training kit + help + Resource Kit,"These books are great only for exam directions. I read the Windows 2000 Network Infrastruture, and there is lacking some important info. The tests ask for some info that is not present on the book. If you buy this book, be prepared to use oftenly W2K help and Resource Kit to get the complete information. After a few chapters, I think it's more productive to jump all ""theorical"" pages and do only the exercices, looking for info on other information sources. I'm MCP on Proxy Server, and have studied using an IDG book. There's all info I need there. New Riders loose time on step-by-steps, and give no technical background. I think I spent my money."
1,Just the facts Ma'am.,"I have passed four certifications and have read a couple text books for each one. For God's Sake! Don't buy the book on 70-215.They have managed to turn an interesting subject matter into one of the dryest, fact only, boring subject matters ever. If you want to live forever, read this whole book (like I did), and you will think you have. I think there was one sentence in the whole book that didn't sound like it was written by a computer.The one star rating is because this book does contain all the facts. However, these facts are not presented in a way that will help in real life, or help you pass the exam.I have found the books from Sybex and Osborne to be good text books, then B-4 you take your certification test read one of the Passport books.I hope I saved you some money."
1,Uhm ... can you spell?,"I was out at a local retail store and I saw this set. Started reading the notes on the side, and there was a word spelled wrong. I bought Sybex ... 1 star because you can't give 0. I mean, I don't know about you, but if there's a mistake on the outside, you have to wonder what's on the inside. A pretty hefty price tag for something that you're going to be tested on."
1,Just Dreadful,"As an academic who loves to shop, I was hoping this would provide a more balanced account of the rise and impact of mass consumerism. He is certainly right that academics and other relatively privileged strata have something of a knee-jerk animus to mass pleasure. But the book is a complete failure. It amounts to little more than a defense brief for mass consumerism--and like a good defense lawyer, he ignores evidence that doesn't fit his case, distorts the arguments of his foes, and offers a rosy, unreal view of his client. ... Skip."
2,Do yourself a favor and pass on this winded exposition.,"Twitchell makes some valid points about consumerism--if you can plod through this ""hard"" read with a dictionary at your side. I disagree with his view that we middle-aged folks of today have selectively forgotten how important consumption was for us. Contrary to his opinion, I believe that we were not consumed by such materialism as the youth are today. It is quite a different ""triumph of stuff"" today. What a shame that we must give identity to ourselves through the things we purchase. Give me Elaine St. James and her book, Simplify Your Life."
5,Kyffnremt,"If you are just beginning in the Amateur radio field this is the radio to start with. With all the ""bells and whistles"" of the other big name radios this one pack a punch without the hefty price. Cobra has done a great job with this radio."
5,perfect!,"I love this little set. I had one as a child and it was still at my parents house when my daughter visited this summer. So it was a must have at our own house. she can store lots of papers and other school treasures in it, it's portable and perfectly sized for her American girl doll. Simple, Practical, CLASSIC and FUN toy!"
2,not what I expected,The sliding part needs a latch or something to keep from sliding top from coming undone!!!! Our little one couldn't write on chalkboard.
5,Perfect,This is the perfect size and product. I am very pleased with my purchase. I wish it would have said it came with chalk so I didn't purchase extra but we will eventually need more anyways so its not that big of a deal.
4,Loved it!,This was a Christmas gift for my friends little girl who is 3. She loved it. She especially liked filling the storage compartment. It was the perfect size for her. I was planning on purchasing a second one for her other child. I would recommend this toy to others.
3,Okay,"For the price this is an okay toy. It has a chalkboard on one side and also includes a dry erase section, but I found both a little tricky to erase fully. I was hoping to use it for travel and keep my son's crayons, drawing items etc. but the most excitement he had was opening and closing it. I wish I would saved the money to our of the other more elaborate doodle type travel pads, more suited to a car seat. Our friends purchased another brand with more options and they rave about it. I can see why."
5,Great,My son really likes this. He spends more time writing since he got this. I like that he can put his chalk and markers inside and carry it with him.
2,Don't like it,"I ordered this product after reading the good reviews. But when I received it - it was smaller than I expected. We have tried writing with the chalk and after a couple of times, the 3 of the chalk pieces have broken. The chalk eraser they give you is horrible. It hardly erases and takes a long time to erase and leaves little strings/mess all over. There is not an eraser for the dry eraser board. My son looked at it and that was about it. No interest. I have to go out and buy new chalk, a new chalk board eraser and a dry eraser to clean it with. I would definetly not recommend buying this."
2,Chalkboard/Whiteboard,"My grandson loves the chalkboard/whiteboard. It is built into a handy carrying case that holds chalk, dry erase markers, and erasers. I was disappointed in the eraser though. It is a tiny one and is not made of the absorbent material most erasers are. It feels like more of a twiney type of material and it leaves quite a bit of chalk dust behind. I am going to buy my grandson a regular chalkboard eraser as the one included with this set was definitely inferior quality."
1,really bad book,"this book reads as if it was written only to make money. it contains a ton of unnecessary information. if you have to read it for class get some coffee. if you plan to become an entrepreneur, buy a book written to help people other than the authors, e.g. ""business model generation"".Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers"
5,"fast delivery, great book","I had no probs. When I did write the seller, he wrote back promptly. It also was the quality stated. Thanks Again!!!"
5,A rare book and historical document,"This book was one of the first authentic, english language books on Kung Fu published. The style portrayed in this book is the Fut Gar Branch of the Sil lum (Southern Shaolin) martial arts. It contains many testimonial letters from martial artists who are now listed in the Martial Arts Hall of Fame. The highlight of this book is that it accurately details the 1st and 2nd forms of the system- Lin Wan Keun, Meng Fu Har Sahn (Continuous Returning Fist, Fierce Tiger Descends Mountain). This book gives you a very clear window on Martials Arts in the 1960's. Leo Fong, who also published a book on this subject, learned it from T. Y. Wong.When I originally wrote this review I described the Kung Fu style as Fut Gar. New information accurately identifies this syle as a synthesis of Hung and Toy (Choi) Gar syles developed by Leong Tin Chee and further modified by Prof. T. Y. Wong. For more information visit the ""Kin Mon"" Sil Lum web site. (SKM)"
4,My Daughter Loves it!,"My daughter loves this. She says ""favorite song"" when she wants to hear it. She listens to ""Jump up"" over and over. We have Renee's Hannukah CD too which my daughter now listens to over and over. Renee is very talented and makes cd's that aren't annoying for me to listen to over and over."
4,Retro disco-techno fusion with occasional rap.,"I know that a lot of people are obsessed with Japanese pop and rock music, which inspired me to give several such albums a listen. After sampling dozens of discs, I found Denki Groove's Last Supper collection of singles and remixes to be one of the best. It's mainly thumping computer-produced dance music and yet, sounds too ""pop"" to be considered as only techno.It's hard to find this double disc set in stores, because only a few thousand were made. As a previous review has mentioned, the set comes with a full color, large 32 page booklet (with full discography, videography, biography in japanese only) attached to the cardboard case. This was released to celebrate their 10th year in business.A less-expensive single CD version is usually in stock but does not have the bonus disc of remixes and previously only-on-vinyl releases."
5,keeps on giving and giving,"I used this series for my son (now 14), and have now purchased the first book in the series for my daughter's daughter. She's loving it! Just wish I had known about it when my daughter was small."
2,Italics has my kid in tears,"It is a beautiful script but the sequence that they go through letters has my daughter in tears. The letter k is the 4th letter they learn. The teacher book does not give any clear instructions on what to say to children besides midline and base line. My daughter is extremely frustrated. Needless to say, so is her mother. : I am going probably going to buy handwriting without tears. When she is older she can choose to learn italics if she chooses. Until then, I give up on this curriculum."
1,Very disappointed.,Hollywood Fashion Tape Hollywood CoverupsI was very disappointd . They would not stick well atall. I had three sets & none of them worked. This was $45.00 wasted.I should rturned them after the first set did not work. I would not recommend them.
4,Diverse Compilation,"Dave Holland's ""Rarum"" has 11 songs from 11 different albums, and they fill the CD with 76 minutes of music. On a CD as willfully diverse and packed full as this, I wonder what song choice compromises were made, since the tunes are not equally good. I don't have any of the original CD's represented here, so this CD was a good introduction to the ECM solo part of Dave Holland's career. ""How's Never"" opens the CD on a relatively breezy note. We then go forward and backward through Dave Holland's career. There are no solo bass songs, but ""Inception"" is a good solo cello song. ""Equality"" has a vocal by Cassandra Wilson. The CD ends strongly with ""Prime Directive"", ""Homecoming"", and ""Conference Of The Birds"". ""Conference Of The Birds"" is my favorite, it has a witchy melody, and great playing by Holland, Anthony Braxton, and Sam Rivers. I recommend this CD if you don't have the original albums."
4,"Helpful, user-friendly, reassuring and practical handbook.","This terrific handbook is user-friendly and easy to read. The authors pose and answer questions that most nanny employers have struggled with, but have been afraid to ask. I read the book in one sitting, just as I was about to switch nannies, and it greatly reassured me about this monumental decision. I would highly recommend this book to other nanny employers -- it reads as if you are having a conversation with a wise girlfriend!"
5,great advice for babysitters and nannies!,"I saw this book in an article in the New York Times a few weeks ago...at just the same time I was hiring yet another new nanny. I love this book. The advice is straightforward and there are all kinds of great stories from both parents and nannies about how to get along. The chapters on hiring, salary needs, time off (do you pay for President's Day?), and sorting out the household chores have all come in handy. If you are thinking of making a change--or are hiring for the first time--I highly recommend this book. We've bought our new nanny a copy too!"
4,Good enough!,"This is Gates, a Harvard black scholar, opining about multiculturalism debates in the early 90s. It said some useful stuff which may seem a little dated now. For example, he asks why can't all campuses be like Berkeley where there is no racial majority? Well, that question is totally moot post-Proposition 209. As all Harvard black scholars have become recently controversial, this book will be a good intro book for lay readers to see what the controversy is all about. This book is written in a simple fashion that any person should be able to understand. Do not sleep, however! Gates has written many articles and books that only elite readers could understand. Do not believe the lies of the new Harvard president."
3,Drill game,"Most of the features they advertise occur only in tutorial mode. The game itself takes place on a fictitious island. It's linear, short, and not terribly exciting. The way everything happens is by the player answering multiple choice geography questions. There are also bonus questions where you have to find places on a map, arrange places in order, etc. They do show you the correct answer if you get a question wrong. If you get too many wrong the mission is aborted and you have to start over.Its a cute good for drilling geography facts."
1,The Witch Queen and Witch's Honor are the same book!,"Buyer beware; The Witch Queen and Witch's Honor are the same book with different titles. In all the ending was such a let down for a trilogy with such potential that you most assuredly woouldn't want to read it twice, much less buy it twice!"
4,Fascinating end to a wonderful trilogy,"I read Prospero's children and got bound by the magic woven by the author. When I read the reviews that said that the third book was a let down, I felt compelled to add my two cents. In short, there was no other way the book could have ended and also kept the magic intact. It is different and is definitely not a comfortable-mass-paper-back-ending. It leaves a taste - as a wine connoisseur might attempt to describe - of intrigue, the fullness of a life time, of light from the setting sun casting a cloak of warmth on the vines, giving it a taste to remember. I would highly recommend it!"
2,Extremely disappointing finish to what could have been a first-rate trilogy,"I was extremely disappointed by this book, which was a great surprise. I really enjoyed the first two in the trilogy - they are intelligently and elegantly written, the plots are quite creative, and the central characters believable and sympathetic. Ryan's fluency in myth and ancient religion satisfyingly informs all three books, and I enjoyed the development and maturation of contemporary (and reluctant) witch Fern Capel.The ending of this book is so disappointing, so poorly thought out, so logically inconsistent, that it ruined all three books for me - which I wouldn't have believed possible. I'm so annoyed by it that I can't get it out of my head; I keep realizing yet more ways in which it just doesn't hold together. I've rarely been so unexpectedly disappointed."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I purchased this product to generate dvd player slide shows. The box says that it will allow you to edit images, zoom and pan, add music, and add text. Yes, it will do those feature IF YOU PAY MORE. Every time I attempted to use anything other than the basics, you get a message saying that you have to purchase the upgrade. On top of that, the program is very difficult to use and not very user friendly. (and I have been making computer slide shows for years)."
2,Let Buyer Beware,"I received Pinnacle Studio 10.0 with three disc's in a plastic container for two.I downloaded disc 1 then it asked for disc 2, then it asked for disc 3 which is thebonus disc. The bonus disc asked if i wanted to download it, yes or no. I kept clicking yes but nothing happened. I finally click on no and the downloading continued to the finish. When I tried to use my new movie maker, it said i needed to down load 10.7 then 10.8 in that order. I searched the internet and finally found them. I also found out that their isn't any support for Pinnacle 10.0 on down, so you're on your own. My problem now is, when i hit capture, a window pops up saying "" make sure your camera is turned on and it's in the play position and make sue your firewire is connected (1394 port) I even used a different one but the window with the instructions still pop up. I've sent e-mail's to Pinnacle but as of now, NO HELP. This is why i'm not satisfied."
1,Very annoying,"I just tried the trial, and I will NOT buy it. It's difficult to accomplish the things I can easily do in Movie Maker. And there's no visible way of uninstalling it. It doesn't show up in the Control Panel Add and Remove Programs. There's no uninstall file in the Pinnacle folders. A trial you can't get rid of? I'm in good company with the negative recommendations."
1,Studio Plus Version 10.5,"This product is pure crap. I have used versions 7,8,9 happily, and now 10.5. I want my money back! Version 10 is completely unstable, and nearly unusable. If you must use Pinnacle, buy version 9. Pinnacle tech support is just as worthless. I have a call into Jeffery Hastings Pinnacles GM at 605.930.3068 to see what plans they have to save this product."
2,Can't be installed and inaccessable tech support,"When I attepted to install the Studio 10 package it asks for a Serial number, but there is none. On their web site, they claim that there is a yellow slip of paper with the number on it, but there is no such thing. Their tech support requires that you register with them, which you can't do without a serial number. Bogus. Finally, their non-800 number telephone support has a wait time of over 30 minutes. Can this be worth it?"
1,Crashes when adding music tracks- Not recommended,"I unfortunately upgraded from version 9, which ran fine to version 10, which crashes systematically when trying to add a music track to a 40 minutes DVD project. All 10.x versions, including the latest 10.5.2 patch exhibit the same problem. Technical support was fast and friendly but unhelpful."
1,"Avoid unless you have a new, fast computer","Perhaps if you have a brand-new, very fast computer, this program would be OK but if you have a slower, older computer - forget about it. It runs on my two year old PC (XP-SP2) but not well enough to use. I am going to uninstall it and return to my old ULead Video Studio program."
1,Wish I Could Give It A ZERO,"DON'T BUY THIS SOFTWARE! It's Pure Junk. I bought directly from Pinnacle. They know they have a real dog on their hands. Support is worthless, especially when they use the ""shotgun"" approach...""try this, uninstall that, try it in Safe Mode, etc..."" and then have the chutzpah to want to charge you $25 for your second call to support!If you go to their site, you'll see that the complaints are the same on their forum board, problem is, it's hard to find the forum. There are patches, more downloads, special instructions...I could go on an on.I don't understand why a class action suit hasn't been filed against Pinnacle."
3,Better get comfortable with Pinnacle forums,"After I bought Studio 10 I spent the next 5 weeks tring to get it to work. Pinnacle was not willing to refund, so I settled in to the support forums and eventually it produced a final product. 5 stars for easy and fun to use. 1 star for the hassle and unpreparedness of the software at release. If you are computer savvy and have a lot of patience, go ahead. It will definately challenge you. Or, wait until mid 1st quarter 2006. Rumor has it they should have a patch to fix it, making it a great product."
1,Pinnacle 10 Debacle,"Followed company's instructions for set-up (separate hard drive, etc.) and meet or exceed hardware/memory requirements. Result? Program consistently freezes in the editing mode requiring task manager to kill the program. Cannot get through the editing of a 15 minute video clip! I certainly hope the manufacturer gets some of this feedback."
3,"Great product, not so great taste","This product cleans your teeth really well. It's slightly abrasive, but doesn't seem to much that it would wear your enamel down (check with your dentist before using, mine gave it green light).It doesn't take much just a few 'poof's of the bottle on the wet brush. You can work up a slight lather while brushing, but nothing that makes you look like a rabid dog.My only recommendation is to try the mint or other flavors because the lime taste like the Sourpatch Kids lime candy."
2,Could be better,"Good stuff:1. great number of images for reasonable priceOK:1. application speed and search engine2. integration of vol.1 and vol.2Negative (things that got worse since vol.1&2):1. no image catalog (book) that used to be included with the vol.1&2. Yet, the price is still the same as before. It was nice to have the book and decide what images I want before actually doing it on computer.2. I haven't found the usual ""image fonts"" in this volume.3. Integration is somewhat weird starting with vol. 3. Why change the system that was working perfectly fine.4. On-line? Why would I buy 50,000 images and want to get online and buy more? Yet I think that this online feature is slowing down things (although, it can be turned off).Overall: not as good as Vol.1, but pic quality better than in Vol.2. Still, Hemera is cutting cost by not including the usual image catalog and changing things (user interface) that have been working fine before."
1,not current. pictures are ugly and unusable.,"I just bought it and installed the software. I went through almost all the pictures (50,196) and unfortunately, i couldn't find anything i can use :(Some of the people on here writing positive reviews either work for Hemera (BEWARE) or are complete MORONS!Don't buy this software. It's horrible."
4,Franklin Sports 3919 Expert Pitching Horseshoe Set,The carrying case and the set is great. Very compact and professional looking. A great gift!
1,Stop advertising a set that doesn't exist,I ordered this set over a year ago and the product still is not available for purchase. Amazon offered it for preorder for almost a year before admitting that it doesn't exist. What a crock. This sounds like a great set...if only it weren't imaginary.
2,Too sad for me,"It may be just me, but I found this story to be too sad. I read to lift my spirits and this book didn't do that. Also, there was a lot of popping back and forth between past and present, which made the story a little hard to follow as well as gave away the ending."
4,Looking forward to the Sequel,"I didn't want this book to end - although I had to see how it would. I wanted Linden Corners to be real, I wanted the Windmill to be real, and I wanted the directions to vacation there. Living in the Hudson Valley region, I thought Mr. Pittman captured the true essence of the region, and although the characters of the book were fictional, I felt they were very real and believable.This book was very enjoyable, real and totally involving. A quick summer book which was a nice change from typical formula books. It had enough twists that I didn't predict the ending. I look forward to Joseph Pittmans second book."
5,Orange Sky - Amazing,"Orange Sky has a sound all their own, there is nothing being played on the radio that can come close. If you are like me, over rotated songs and similarly sounding bands on the radio has gotten tired. Orange Sky has what you have been looking for, the hard and fast style of a rock band, with the subtle influence of Reggae. While not overpowering, it is noticeable, but sounds better than anything that you have ever heard. Check out the web site, [...]. My favorite tracks are as follows: Beautiful Day, Peace Train, Escape, & Alone. If the album moves you, the DVD sample will kick you in the chest. [...] Give Orange Sky a shot, you will not be disappointed."
4,"Great live, hope CD is as good","I just saw these guy's last night opening for Yngwie Malmsteen. They were really good, and the drummer is absolutely one of the best I have ever seen. I'm buying this based on their show, and I'm confident that the songs I heard live will be just as good on disc."
1,Nil evidence,"I don't doubt that UFO's exist, but this book is a sorry excuse for what the title promises: The real story of unidentified flying objects. It seems to me that the author is jumping to conclusions..."
3,Buying a used LCD,"Although the overall performance of this LCD is satisfactory, but not having the original remote has made the operation of the LCD a real challenge. I wish I knew then what I know now. In addition, no explanation of delivery was disclosed. The unit was delivered on a huge box truck and strapped to an enormous wooden pallet which would normally require a forklift to remove had it not been for some creative thought and a very helpful truckdriver."
1,HORRIBLE QUALITY- stay away,"If I could give it ZERO stars, I would.I purchased two of these Kyocera Damascus knives as a Christmas present. The 6"" knife's blade broke off at the handle the VERY FIRST TIME it was used. Simply chopping carrots, and it snapped. I might expect this from a $20 knife, but for the price I paid for this one, I expect a lifetime of use.Will NEVER buy another Kyocera ceramic knife."
4,Good Camera,This is a great camera that is easy to use and takes great video in almost every situation. This camera is for the person who wants to video his family and friends and keep is simple.The only complaint is the way it fits in your hand - it will flop over if you let go of it and just use the strap.Works with my Mac.
4,Good Value for money,"PROS : Very good quality of video, OIS, Manual IrisCONS : No Microphone input, not impressed in low light (Magicpix), All interfaces behind the batteryVery impressed by the PV-GS320's optical image stabilization. The image was steady when zoomed at 10x. As the specs mentioned about 10X optical zoom you can zoom till 25X by losing minimum video clarity. The Digital zoom 700x upto me is not useful bcoz when you zoom at half of its digital zoom capacity its looks grainy. Auto focus was good at this level of camera but not best.Read more review at http://myownreviews.blogspot.com/2007/08/panasonic-pv-gs320-review_6780.html It does a great job of capturing high-quality video in auto mode and provides just enough manual control to satisfy the needs of beginners and some advanced amateurs."
2,Video quality is not very good,"Need to do manual adjustments if you want video to be less than lousy (still not very good, though). Looks pretty bad on a large TV.Camera pics are normal video camera quality; not worth using.I'll try again in a few years with a hi def video camera when the prices hit close to what I paid for this model. My ancient video cameras take better video (vhs-c and huge old Canon mini dv)."
3,not so easy with older MAC,"I can plug directly into my EMAC and get the still pictures. BUT getting the video into my Mac hasn't been easy at all. My machine is a little older and i'm using OS 10.3.9. Therefore i have to use a converter box to get my video out.I'll also repeat what the other reviewers say about this not being good for low light situations. I've just purchased a light and battery for the camera which costs an additional $180.However, the color of video shot outdoors is really attractive and i love that the camera is light and easy to carry around."
5,Beautiful Picture!,"When shopping for camcorders I was torn between this one and several (much more expensive) high definition options. I'm happy to have gone with the GS320. It shoots in 16:9 and the image quality looks great on my 42"" HD TV... comparable to watching a DVD I think. Colors are vivid and I have no regrets about not going with a HD camcorder. Software is pretty intuitive, though I wish it allowed for mpeg2 compression (since the avi files you get are HUGE). Otherwise, no complaints."
4,Great miniDV camcorder,"I researched a very long time before making my decision to purchase this camcorder. I have no regrets. The image quality is so real you ""almost"" feel like you're there in the scene as a spectator.The only caveat (minor) is the IS isn't as good as it should be. This is the only reason it's not a 5* review."
4,Awesome camera; but no AV Input,"I bought this camera for two purposes: 1) to replace an older VHS camera and 2) to use for converting my VHS tapes to DVD's. I give it 4-1/2 stars for #1 and 0 stars for #2. (In my research before buying the camera, I managed to miss the fact that the GS320 does not have AV input, so can't be used to convert analog to digital. Rats!)However, for everything else I wanted, I was very satisfied. Other reviewers have pretty well expounded on the pros and cons. I'll just say that the quality of pictures (both video and still) that we get with this camera is really great. When I first got the camera, I handed it our son who is studying Film Production and works with professional camcorders. After fiddling with the controls and looking over its features, he expressed great delight with my purchase. (Yesss!)It took me a while to figure out the menus and I haven't enough experience to handle the manual control options well, but overall, I would highly recommend this camera."
4,great camera,"Great camcorder, watch for the color settings, It would help to point it at something neutral, like a hand befoe using it in extreme sunlight. Excellent product for the price!"
4,Good quality for a good price,"Most of the reviews on here are spot on, so I'll just go with what doesn't work that well and what I found to be a con to this camera.And that is mainly that it's hard to pick up light while retaining image quality in darker places regardless of what settings are used. Also, I'm disappointed by the lack of external microphone jack, and, from what I've seen, the sound quality isn't of the highest quality.In the end, I'll probably just use this for filming music videos.I'd recommend this camera to those relatively new to film and just need something to get started out with that is of reasonable price. I got mine for $320."
4,Great Camera,We replaced our Canon ZR70 with the PV-GS320. There is no comparison in video and audio quality. The Panasonic blows it away. Also compact enough to manage but not so small there's no where to put your hand. Only time will tell if it proves to be reliable. The ZR70 only lasted a couple years.
1,A downgrade from the GS300,"Not only is the physical appearance of this model ugly, it is a complete downgrade. Panasonic takes off one of the most important features on the PV GS320 model,a MICROPHONE JACK! I currently own a 300 model and needed another camera to shoot different angels at the same time, since the 300 is discontinued I purchased the so called upgraded model. Now the only available model with MIC jack is the VDR 310, and I have heard DVD is quality on Camcorders is not what it should be. If you do any video prodcution and need to hook up your camera to a MIC, this camera is not for you."
5,Excellent Camcoder,"I have purchased this camcorder to record my newborn. This one is giving excellent video recording (except at very dark, anyway I will not be recording in complete dark place). I have transferred the video to laptop thru FireWire cable (cheap one purchased from Amazon) and burned a DVD- the image quality is amazing. I would recommend this camcorder over the HDD/DVD based expensive ones. This editing software bundled with this camcorder is good enough for basic editing job."
3,PV-GS320 CamCorder review,"+ This is an excellent buy for the money. If you are looking for something that has nice movie quality and is fairly inexpensive this would be it. The still picture quality is not the greatest but passes for the average photo taker.- I was disappointed that the software that come with it wasn't compatible with Vista, and if you want to put the video on your computer, you will need to buy and additional DV cable in order to transfer your movie clips from the DVI tapes to your computer as well."
2,Poor Design,"For the reasons listed above, I decided NOT to purchase this unit. The mini-dv is on its way out anyway."
3,China going west,A tale of modern China where school graduates have not much to do while mafia developed all skills exhibited explicitly in movies already.Eighteen plus boys attempted to rob a bank following the western movies' examples.Interesting story of local culture and living.
5,"Fantastic, exactly what I wanted","This book was a text I required for a course I am doing and was $16 cheaper than buying it through where I am doing my course. It is exactly the text I was told I needed. It is a very informative, easy to read, and explains all techniques in a practical easy to learn form. I will read and re-read this text."
3,Hits and misses,"""Tangents"" is a mixture of mostly strange, bizzarre 'hard' sci fi and a few stories that actually are easy to grasp by the casual scifi reader (which I am one). Dealing with the drawbacks of genetic programming in a very futuristic world, ""Sisters"" was touching emotionally, a fascinating short story that was very well written. ""Blood Music"", the short that spawned an entire novel by the same name, had an intriguing premise, while ""Tangents"" (the story) showed us the musical bridge to the fourth dimension but the real star of the show was the haunting ""Dead Run"" which was turned into a Twilight Zone episode. Its by far the best of the bunch. The rest range from disgustingly strange, ""Sleepside Story"", which is one of the worst pieces i have ever read, and a giant waste of time, and the same sentiments apply to ""Webster"". Casual sci fi'ers might want to look elsewhere."
2,The Holy Bible KJV,"The Bible by itself is a good and valuable book. The KJV is a good version to study. As a teacher I was looking for an economical text for my students. I was disappointed that, while inexpensive, this edition has no concordance, index, dictionary, or study guide."
4,"A good start, hobbled by errors","Considered a classic by many, the Holy Bible revisits thestandard theses of good vs. evil, God vs. Satan, communityvs. selfishness, etc. etc. etc. The Author, while offering fresh perspectives on many of these issues, fails to credit those whose work He relies so heavily upon -- especially ancient folk lore, Greek mythology, etc. Poor editing, however, leaves the Author's many elementary errors vulnerable to attack -- age of the Earth, evolution, mammalian biology, and so on. Had the Author brushed up on these topics before attempting to write about them, the book would have had a little more impact. As it stands, it is certainly an interesting starting place for further inquiry."
1,It looks like a pirate version!,Very disappointed. Book is a copy of original. CD is also a copy. CDs make noise when playing. I won't recommend this item to anyone.
2,Garbage,"Content is not worth my time, I would much rather be reading a premodern than the stuff within this book"
1,gooses review,This flag is made of a fine material and is a nifty size however north korea is a poor excuse for a nation and dosent deserve a flag. If your looking for a flag to burn or desecrate in protest this is a great choice. The price is a little steep I hope its priced in north korean currency because thats way too much to pay in U.S. currency.
2,Good coffee table book,"This book has nice pictures, but lacks substantive information. I was disappointed by its lack of coverage of any details of the underlying watch movement. I was also surprized by it selection of brands. For example, Movado was included, but Vascheron and JLC were not."
3,"Nice book, but...","I definitely have to agree with the other reviewers. This is a nice compendium of the different watchmakers, it has some good general background of the companies but it only mentions just a few - not all of them.The photos are not that impressive, you can get better photos at some websites or watch magazines.I recommend this book for a starting watch collector to get general information. If you want more in-depth knowledge look for other publications. ..."
5,Excellent,"Just like the other review, with many praises for the quality and the price of this item. Interesting and elegant color selection."
1,Cheap clamps,At first I thought these were Ok but after 6 months of use I am going to discard them to the trash ... The adjustment clamps are made of cheap steel and they rusted shut. I was unable to open them without bending up the entire clamp making them unusable ... Buy ones with solid brass clamps and not these.
4,Great value!,"I think someplace it was mentioned that these were equal to those in dept. store for $27.95. I would imagine that to be true, the workmanship and material is well worth the price and the delivery and service great. Plan to purchase more items from this vendor, based on this purchase.The only reason I did not rate them higher is that I have yet to get the pants back from the Tailor,so I have yet to wear them. Buttton's are not included.Time has past, these are working real well, I anticipate buying a few more colors and possibly some other products from this vendor. If I was rating them today I might consider 5 stars."
1,My cats nails are harder than the blades,"blades are made from extremely weak metal. they dulled out and even bent the first time i clipped my cats nails. also they do not cut clean, probably due to the fact they are so dull. save your money, do not buy these. the generic scissor type i have found to be the best."
4,Good Reference Guide,Good book for the price. Clear information and nice collection of color photographs to help with your identifying of various cloud formations. I would recommend this guide to others. It is a nice addition to any weather book collection.
5,Highly Recommended,I bought this book to prepare for a Meteorology course in college. It prepared me well giving great detail that even a beginner could understand. Contains Stunningly Beautiful pictures.
3,Nice sunglasses but not ruggged,"I got these for my husband after having a pair for at least a year. I love mine and have had no problems. However, when his fell off the dining room table one of the lenses came out. He popped it back in and they are so far, so good. The lenses really permit a sharp image, although I prefer a lighter tint."
4,Very good sunglass,"I try it in a polarized tester and it is original, and it has 100% UV protection.For this price, its ver very good,i recomend it."
3,Doesn't last,"I absolutely love this scent, however, it just doesn't last. I try spraying it on all over and then quickly put my clothes on. The scent lasts on my clothes, but not on my skin."
5,very good,"it is very effective It is useful to my skin.I found my skin better than before.I have wrinkles but with it,my skin become more smooth than before.You will be amazed by this product."
2,Why the bottle is black?,"when i got the item , i found it is different from the picture it show, i never seen the black bottle, i doubt that it is a fake. i wanna get a explain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,It gives me headaches,"I don't know if this is good for your skin, but every time I take the suggested dosage (3 pills, 2x a day) I wake up with a headache the next morning. It gives me a headache even if I just take 1 pill, so I don't know what I'm going to do with it, since I missed the 30 day return window. I think that amazon should make an exception to their return policy when they sell you poison."
1,Don't buy it.,"I've order it online using my smartphone, and it says the order has went through. Got my tracking number, the product never came! 20 bucks not worth spending."
4,I like it !,I read about collagen and it's benefits prior to purchasing this product and I believe it's lived up to what I was expecting.
3,No change,"Not sure how long youre suppose to use this before seeing or feeling any changes but after 2 weeks, nothing. I will continue to take, if for no other reason than I paid my money for it. We'll see.."
2,ONLY OK,My mom hasn't seen any diffrence from taking these and I have two words of warning for you. Horse Pill. If you have a hard time taking large pills this item is not for you.
3,I don't know what's difference,I don't feel anything while taking this pills like other said.Nothing special. it's just supplemental pillsI think it's not working on me or need much more time
5,Super Collagen,"Neocell Super Collagen tablets taken daily really do work. I have noticed thicker hair and smoother skin. I started buying this item at Costco, but then they stopped carrying it. I now order this product through Amazon.com. It costs more than it did through Costco, but the service is good."
3,6 a day! Really?,"Ugh, I have a REALLY hard time swallowing pills, so 3 in the AM and 3 in the PM is rough, add to that these should be taken on an empty stomach and my ""trick"" to swallowing pills is to chew up a bite of food and pop the pill in my mouth just as I'm going to swallow, well, you get where I'm going with that. There is no coating on them either, so they don't ""slide"" down very easy. I'm a trooper, I'll stick with them til the bottle is gone (FYI: if you use my chew, pop, swallow method... jello kinda works and I would assume is better than ""real"" food) Haven't decided what to do after the bottle is gone. May try the powder with juice and vit C, not as cost effective, but these won't do me any good sitting on my shelf because I can't swallow them either.I did notice some improvement in my joint pain and we can pretend that's why I'm taking them and not because I'm 35 and have wrinkles on my forehead that make me self conscious. Yeah, I'm vain, don't judge me! ;-)"
1,Made me nauseous,A friend told me to buy this product to improve nail health. I took one pill and got very nauseous. I am otherwise in very good health. I will not take another one.
3,not quite pleased,"im not really sure how to rate this product but i can only say what my experience has been.first of all these tablets are huge and u got to take 3 two times daily that is 6 whole tablets in one day, i do not take them like they say but i take two in the evening and yes i have seen improvements. so i guess if i took them the way i should ill be 95% happy. would i buy this product again, probably not but only for one reason, the size is too big for the quantity u should take at once and the overall day"
2,hard to swallow,"If you take other supplements in softgel or pills, then you will find this product is hard to swallow. The product is good in terms of nutrients. But, it just doesn't encourage you to ""take three tablets twice daily"".."
3,No Miracles Here,"I took these religiously for the entire bottle...no change in what ails me, which is arthritis. Saw no difference in skin, hair nails. I have a friend who swears by the stuff...so you should try it and see if it works for you. Good luck."
1,Expired products,"This is the second time I order this product. (Which is a little different from the first bottle, which the pill is much bigger than the new one )After 1 week I got the product, I realized I got a expired product! The expired date on the bottle is 0812011 08/15!!!!!It's terrible!"
1,"Gosh, who needs ethics anyway?",Hey - I know - first - make a bunch of money and piss a bunch of people offby spamming the internet. Then make more money selling a book telling othersthis is a great idea.
4,excellent alternative to OEM,"Nice price, works fine. What's not to like? (Actually, one thing not to like: they should show exact photos of the pump, vs. a generic shot, so purchasers could make sure the connectors were correct.)"
5,Great Pack for a Large Laptop,"Great pack for a large laptop and provides security when it is on. Provides padded protection and has enough space for accessories, etc. This is a hardware case, not a large backpack for a weekend or carrying lots of textbooks."
5,Nice bag!,This is a large bag but very comfortable when wearing it. It is exactly what I was looking for. I highly recommend this backpack.
2,Too big and awkward,"This backpack is much taller, wider and heavier than I'd envisioned from the product description. My previous backpack was a similar height but was made of more flexible fabric. I'm a short female, and the backpack was both too tall and too wide on my back. Since the construction is fairly rigid, it's very uncomfortable to wear (it rubs my neck uncomfortably, and also the straps don't line up properly).I also found that the lack of outside pockets is really inconvenient. The front flap has to be unbuckled and completely lifted up to access contents. It was awkward to access things like a water bottle or mp3 player without setting the bag down to completely unfasten it."
3,mixed feelings,"I really liked the look of this bag. I had been searching for a nice big bag for my 17"" laptop. I saw this bag and liked the look. Thought the feature of not being able to open whill on the back was smart. However, I'm a college student and you don't have room for books when the laptop is in the bag. You barely have room without the laptop. It has a rounded bottom which is not condusive to carrying books. It is akward to get into from the back of the bag. Going from class to class, I have to get in and out of my bag all the time. It was too cumbersome with this bag. Really nice looking big bag though. If all you want is to carry your laptop and a few files this might work. Anything more is just doesn't work. Didn't want to return it. Good looking bag nice and big but not very functional"
3,What to expect...,"It is bigger than it looks, so if size is a concern this might be bigger than you'd like and the whole thing as you can see looks like the back of some wild spider :) If you plan to use this mostly for traveling to places you suspect theft is highly likely, then this would be useful. At the same time, trying to access your stuff from this bag is very cumbersome (thus, secure). You would have to twist and turn the straps inside out and towards the back to get the cover unzipped and opened. Your call."
4,Looks like a backpack,"I think there is no other backpack that can hold a 17"" laptop and still has the shape of a ""usual"" backpack. Unfortunately my Asus G73JH does not fit into the designated subfold, but easily into the center subfold. There is still enough room for my gigantic power adapter, my mouse, spare clothes and other stuff. Haven't been riding my bike with it yet, but I don't think I will be disappointed."
3,it's nice.....BUT,I bought this for my hubby's Asus G73 17.3 laptop thinking it would fit with room to spare. BUT that is NOT the case he just barley gets it to fit in there & zip it up. While its a snug fit I didnt return it. Overall its a nice backpack we like the securtiy feature (can only be unzipped if its off your back) & it's comfy to use for long trips. Overall I wouldnt buy it again though just because of the snug fit with this specific laptop.
4,"Correct choise for 17"" and 18.4"" laptop","I bought this backpack for my 18.4"" qosmio. It fits exactly and enough room for rest."
4,Like It A lot BUT...,"This a great computer backpack if all you want to carry is your computer and its accessories and maybe a few folders. For that I love it. However, my 17"" Gateway 7811FX will not fit unless I remove the battery. Drag. I am not really a shut the computer down every time person. I like to shut it and run so for me its a small drawback."
4,"Good, not great...","I bought and used this backpack for a trip to Amsterdam. I bought it mainly because of the security features, and for that it is excellent. Having the zippers inaccessible puts your mind at ease in a big crowd or on the train or tram. The major con of this pack is that the dividers don't go all the way to the bottom, all small items fall directly to the bottom and are hard to access. Overall I would recommend this pack to travelers and motorcyclists."
4,"Mobile Edge Secure Pack 17"" Backpack","This Backpack is a very good investment to secure your laptop. The Idea is brilliant. This thing works, you carry this backback and nobody has accsessto your laptop or whats or ever.I Highly recomment this Mobile Edge Backback.Quality and design top notch as well.Love this thing."
1,"Huge, too huge","The 17"" laptop by it's self is big, but when you put it in the backpack there is still space to the sides and top of the computer. too much.The style really looks like a TMNT shell. Its good for tricker-treating.It's secure thats for sure and if you don't care about style than this is the one for you."
3,"A brilliant idea, but...","A colleague recommended the Mobile Edge SecurePack 17"" Backpack to me to carry my new (huge) laptop, so I purchased it. I excitedly opened the box and started filling up the backpack with all the necessities of my mobile office: laptop, battery charger, extra disks, books, pencils, PDA, file folders, digital camera, flashlight, mouse, mouse pad, etc., etc. To my dismay, I was only able to fit a fraction of the things I needed to carry around into this backpack.The idea of making it impossible to get into the backpack unless it has been removed from your shoulder is brilliant, and the product is constructed of excellent materials. However, it was quite a bit short on storage space for my needs, so I regrettably had to return it. If the manufacturers could somehow make it larger while still keeping the overall design within proportion, I reckon they would have a winner of a product."
5,Mobile backpack,I have had many mobile backpacks over the years. This backpack takes the cake. Lots of room. Well designed spaces for all types of tech. The ipod slot on the top is pisser. For the money a great value. I highly recommend you purchase this backpack. You won't be sorry. The only downside is the color selection. 2 choices are poor. That is the only minor gripe.
5,Relief.,"Relief is the only word to characterize how I felt after reading this book. Having dealt with chronic pain since childhood, I have been shuffled around from specialists, chiropractors, physical therapists and the list goes on, Dr. Gelb's explanations were the first ever to explain the symptoms just like mine. I cried as I read the personal stories which could have been my own. This book offers hope to the chronic pain sufferer specifically TMJ. It gives hope to know someone has finally figured out what is wrong with the millions of Americans struggling to live a normal life due to their pain."
3,"Good, unpretentious musical film from Africa","This third feature by director Flora Gomes of the African country of Guinea Bissau is a bit disappointing after his previous film, the stunning Po di Sangui, but this musical comedy about the success in Paris of a young black woman singer from the island of Cape Verde is quite charming, if a bit amateurish at parts. The starring actress can't be faulted, the songs are good if not particularly memorable but the often silly dialogue and story are the main culprits here, I think. Still, for those interested in seeing a different sort of film (far away from the dull, artier African films often seen at film festivals) this is a movie I can readily recommend. (By the way, the director, despite his name, is a man)."
4,"Entertaining African musical, a bit unpolished perhaps, but well worth watching","This third feature by director Flora Gomes of the African country of Guinea Bissau is a bit disappointing after his previous film, the stunning Po di Sangui, but this musical comedy about the success in Paris of a young black women singer from the island of Cape Verde is quite charming, if a bit amateurish at parts.

1,Buyer beware,"This merchants products are great, if they actually decide to ship the product you order. I ordered some products from them more than sixty days ago and the order was not shipped, but my credit card was charged promptly, I receive no reply to the numerous emails I send requesting a ship date or a refund. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Simple but effective,This is kind of a common sense book. It's brief and told in little stories. Almost biblical. This is a code to live by.
2,Simplistic,"Some useful points, but the book over-generalizes what to expect in the dynamics of a relationship. The narrative turns what could be a 10 page essay into a 128 page book and it is written at a fairly low level."
1,Hardly a baking powder,"After a few uses, this powder spoilt a cake. It has lost its raising power. It is still well within the expiry date and the container has been kept closed and in a dry place. Avoid this one. I plan to ask for a refund."
5,Great Father / Son Story,"What a wonderful book to share with your son and his father. This book may seem a bit outdated with its seventies style artwork, but the timeless tale is perfect for the modern day stay-at-home dad and the wonderful family experience of living in the moment and making everyday activities such as bathtime, washing dishes and making dinner lively, memorable events to be shared over and again. Very refreshing."
3,Cute,"A little long winded...more for pre-schoolers than for toddlers...but a good spin on the ""traditional"" family roles."
4,nice book for older toddlers,"This book is nice in several ways: as a gentle depiction of a young child's evening routine it shows a boy and his father doing a lot together, and doing so in settings and situations familiar even to young children -- a daycare center, the grocery store, the kitchen, taking a bath and getting ready for bed. Mommy, Daddy and child interact cooperatively and in pleasant, fun ways.A little wordy for a 2-year old, but I simplify it a bit as I read, and plan to add more later."
2,Written with an obvious agenda,"I will give the author, Randall Neustaedter, credit for writing a very informative book. It appears to be well researched, it is an easy read, and he does not write over the reader's head with medical jargon.However, I did not have the book in my possession for more than 24-hours before I returned it. At the end of each chapter he ties together his research into a recommendation, and almost every time it is the same thing: ""Don't get your child vaccinated."" I found his conclusions ironic, when his research, in many cases, seemed to suggest that the chances of a child suffering a vaccine induced injury were remote, at best.In short, it was obvious to me that this book was written with a slant, and it was not the objective look at vaccines that my wife and I were hoping it would be."
2,Flawed to the point of uselessness,"The book suffers from three crucial deficiencies: logical fallacies, meaningless statistics, and a double standard of evidence.The logical fallacies tend to be ad hominem arguments, along the lines that Dr X's research can't be valid because he had an interest in the outcome. Meaningless statistics include counts of cases with bad outcomes, but no mention of the total cases or of the overall probability of a bad outcome. The double standard is that the author attacks studies that were performed using scientific methods with claims of inadequate rigor, but asserts the efficacy of untested treatments: the bad guys weren't rigorous enough, but the good guys don't have to be rigorous at all.The author doesn't support his arguments, and his numerous errors and omissions blow his credibility, so you can't just trust his judgment either. Don't waste your time."
5,Excellent and mostly unbiased,"This is a great book. It's honest, and I like that. It's really interesting how unnecessary most vaccines are and how terrified the media and corporate drug companies like to keep us parents for their own gain. My husband and I have chosen not to vaccinate our son anymore than he has now that we have been able to make a completely informed choice about vaccinations."
2,Swan Contractor SNCG34050 3/4-inch by 50' grey water hose,"This hose is durable, but it's so stiff that it's difficult to use. I recommend looking for a garden hose that's durable but much more flexible."
2,"Good quality sander, but I have a major issue","I have used a DeWalt palm sander for many years. When my other one was getting too old, I purchased this model from another store. It does emit a screeching noise as stated in some other reviews. However, the one thing that really bothers me is that the base is too large to actually use a 1/4 sheet of sandpaper. I did not have this issue with my other DeWalt palm sander. I contacted DeWalt, and they did not respond. The only reason I purchased the DeWalt was that I was familiar with how it worked. There are other sanders that have been reviewed more favorably. I will be going elsewhere for my sander needs in the future."
5,Dewalt Orbital Sander,"This is the second Dewalt Orbital 1/4th sheet Sander that I have owned. I bought the first in 1996 and have used it continuously in making small train sets, backyard windjammers and various other small wooden cutouts and toys for kids & older folks. I number each item I make and the curent number is 1,922 so you can see that the first sander was well used. I purchased a new one from Amazon to replace the one that quit. I rate it five stars. Also I find that I have better luck finding and ordering some iems from Amazon than from some other companies."
4,Nice sander,"The sander is TON better than the old Black & Decker that it replaced. It is pretty quiet, doesn't vibrate too much, and the dust control does seem to do a really good job. Cutting a standard sheet of sandpaper into 1/4 sheets works just fine. The paper is easy to load too. The included hard case is large enough for the sander to easily fit back into. All in all a good product."
4,Did the job it was ordered for well.,The sander was ordered to remove the paint and most of the texture from a kitchen wall between the counter top and cabinets. There was plenty of power to drive the 50 grit paper I was using. My shop-vac hose would not fit the hose adapter that is available when the dust bag is removed; was my only complaint. I didn't use it for finish sanding.
2,Broke after 9 months,"This is the first palm sander I've ever bought. It worked well for me for 9 months sanding the faces of plywood and MDF. I estimate I used it for 40 hours or less. Then it broke - the part of the plastic foot the orbiting bearing pushes against broke and parts of it spit out of the fan. I think this was because it was assembled incorrectly - one of the screw inserts in the plastic pieces that the foot attaches to was installed the wrong way around and this caused the foot to not sit flat. This could have concentrated stress from the orbiting bearing in one location on the plastic causing it to fail. I could go get it fixed (it's still under warranty), but it's not worth the time and trouble to do so compared to the cost of a new sander. So it's off to the hardware store to buy something else."
2,"Pretty good, but died too soon","I'm not a heavy user; general household, light woodwork. I'm female, and don't put a whole lof of pressure. I've had it 4 or 5 years. It just died as I was using it. Suddenly started making an unpleasant noise while running, I turned it off and made sure nothing was stuck etc. Let it cool a little (although I'd been using it less than 5 minutes this time), made sure there wasn't a lot of dust on it, then turned it back on, and it made one last louder noise and quit entirely.I usually like DeWalt tools; I've had a drill for years. But I'll go looking for a different sander."
4,Great sander for the price,I am very pleased with the performance of this sander. I don't think it is any noisier than expected. The only disappointment was the difficulty in connecting to my shop vacuum. The end of the hose on my vac is the same diameter as the connection on the samder. I was able to rig up an adapter using a section of an old inner tube from a bicycle tire.
2,Disappointed Again with DeWalt,"Purchased the Dewalt 2644 sander and the on off switch is defective. It turns on and off all by itself, must be very careful when plugged in. Also, the rubber pad is to large for quarter sheet and the rubber is chipping off. The small metal rods to hold the sheet to sander is so weak they bend easy. I have had the worse luck with DeWalt, also owned several other tools and will go back to Rigid."
2,an unusual problem,"This sander has a dust bag that after using is still like new--clean! The dust is blowing everywhere but into the bag. I think somthing is put together backwards from the mfgr. I will return soon as I can for credit, I hope. It sands great and will be fine for anyone with a full face breather or working outside with a stiff wind."
3,good sander but the dust collection doesn't hold up.,"i have this same problem with pretty much all palm sanders, when they get about six months old the dust collector stops controlling the majority of the dust. i have tried taking them (i have two DeWalt palm sanders) apart and blowing it out and that helps for a few days. so that kinda rules it out for interior work. about a year ago i picked up a Bosch palm sander, as of yet it still controls nearly all the dust so if you are working in a shop without really good ventilation go with the Bosch. but all and all this is a nice smooth running machine."
3,Short,Whom are these troll short fat bodies this jacket is made for!I am big am bought a size up as recomended and still this this look like oopa loopa were!I have an older dickies jacket that is much longer!.Last dickies purchase i think!
4,Lovely fragrance.,"This is a lovely fragrance, but I found that it did not reproduce the scent as well during burning as it did with the stick itself. I have since used the package as a potpourri for drawers and cupboards."
1,Dino deserves a better biography than this,"Dean Martin, one of the most successful entertainers in history, deserves a better biography than this hastily written, poorly edited, work of pulp."
3,dean martin biography,"i own alot of dean martin biographies, this is one of the ok ones. most of the book is spent on deans partnership with jerry lewis and thru out the whole book in my opinion is discussed too much. they also dont even mention his son dying in a plane crash until the next to last page and then its back to jerry lewis again."
4,Does a great job and courseness setting works well.,"I use a french press which requires a course grind with little or no fines. The Pavoni does a good job maintaining a consistent grind and there is just a little dust in the hopper when its finished. The cup setting for the amount to be ground is for European size cups...so I set it on four cups to make to two large cups of coffee. I've been using this for about 1 year without any problems, and the hopper does fine in the dishwasher. It is a little staticy and the grounds stick sometimes, and if you dont get it perfectly seated in the grinder you will make a mess."
2,Burr Coffee Grinder,"This product was not right for us because we discovered (only after opening the package) that it does not grind coffee fine enough for espresso, which is what we had bought it for. If you don't need that feature, it's a fine machine."
2,Not what I was hoping for,"The grind settings are virtually indistinguishable from each other. I would have preferred fewer settings that were actually different. On the coarsest setting it is still too powdery. Also, the grinder creates enough static electricity that the grounds stick to the plastic catch bin, and thus create a mess all over the counter and coffee machine when trying to transfer from one machine to another. It works as a grinder, but the quality of the finished product is no better than my lesser expensive (and cleaner to use) blade grinder."
5,Excellent product and service,I would recommend Amazon to anyone. I needed my order before Christmas and it was delivered within 2 days. The product was just what I expected!! Thank you Amazon!!
5,Works great!,"I did not purchase this bulb for a projector. I purchased it for a theater spot light. For this purpose in works very well. It puts out and unbelievable amount of light and gets ridiculously hot. This is not a negative, all bulbs of this type get hot. Just remember that it will cause serious burns if touched and will melt without proper cooling measures.You can't beat this price."
4,Sex in the Church?,"Rev. Jamal Harrison Bryant makes his entrance onto the literary scene with a book that deals with the subject of human sexuality and spirituality. Sexuality is a topic that is hard for most pastors to discuss, however Rev. Bryant speaks to the issues with a bold frankness.Foreplay is an adaptation of a series of sermons that Rev. Bryant preached at his church, Empowerment Temple in Baltimore. It is from these sermons that the ministry of Empowerment Temple took shape. From the testimonial foreword where Rev. Bryant tells of his addiction to all the sermons contained in the book, Rev. Bryant delivers a powerful shot to the spiritual being. The various sermon titles such as ""The Thong Song"" and ""I Need Some Foreplay"" will intrigue you.This short book can be used a guide for personal growth. Teen and/or young adult groups wanting to discuss human sexuality and its spiritual side can use this book as a starting point.Reviewed by Robilyn Heath"
2,Simply a Collection,"This book is a collection of SOME of the works of William Howard Taft but the title is quite misleading, as it does NOT include State of the Union Addresses. Also the author has not taken the time or effort to provide the reader / researcher with an INDEX, which, of course, means that one has to read the entire collection to find references to a particular subject matter. In short, this book is merely a reprinting of some of Taft's speeches and addresses and nothing more!"
2,Microphone is Weak,The microphone is way too weak to be able to sustain a comfortable conversation. You get what you pay for in this case.
4,My favorite of 3,I have 2 other sets of headphones with mics and have gone through at least 6 other sets the last 10 years. These that go behind the head on the back of the neck seem the most comfortable to me. The quality of inbound and outbound sounds seems pretty good as well again compared to other headsets I have tried.
1,Don't buy,"I'm not exactly sure if these headphones broke during shipping. I can say that the item looked cheap, really cheap. It was flimsy too. I might have broken it just looking at the thing. That's how cheap they were. The website, upon trying to return the headset, told me that I would get my money back AND KEEP THE HEADSET. It's so cheap the company doesn't even want it back. Don't buy this."
4,"Comfortable even with glasses, good sound both ways",I think my title says it all! I did take off one star because I think it's just silly to not have a mute option. Still a good buy. I use it on my VOIP office phone and appreciate the generous length of the cord.
2,Poor quality microphone,Got this to do video chat with people far away. The headset is fine and has good quality music for the price but my microphone doesn't work and it gives an echo in the headset when i talk or use it in chat. Didn't serve my purpose.
3,Review,"I have no problem with this headset yet. But when I use it for a long while it hurts my ears because of its shape. Maybe it is OK because using these stuffs continuously will hurt the listening ability after a long time. I am consent with sound quality and microphone. But here one thing I don't know other headsets have or not: when I increase the sound volume, other people in my office can easily hear the playing music. I don't know it is because of the design of this headset or it is prevalent. That's all!"
4,Comfortable fit,Very comfortable with good sound. I'm using it with an interactive language program & am uncertain of the microphone quality. May be my pronunciation is worse than I thought.
4,Not bad for the price,I have absolutely no complaints for the price I bought this product for. The only thing is they are not adjustable on your ears. Sound quality is decent.
3,It's ok for the money,"Not bad for general purpose use, I didn't really get these for great stereo sound, but for the microphone use. Since I don't have any other headphones for music, I use these. If I were looking for a headset that sounds great with music, I'd go with something else."
2,At least they were cheap,"I bought three of these headsets for roughly $10 dollars each. One was for my girlfriend, one for my home PC and one for my work laptop. After four weeks, only one pair still works. The microphone on one stopped working. I'm thinking the wire connecting the mic to the earpiece got cut one of the times I had to push the earpiece back together. The earpieces came apart frequently.The other one snapped in my computer bag and one earpiece was left dangling. That was kinda' my fault but I'm guessing more sturdily constructed earphones might've held up. If you'll follow my advice, you'll get a headset with a case.If you're debating it, spend $30 dollars more and get a good wireless headset. You won't miss the dangling cord for one thing and you won't be tethered to your computer whenever you have to dial out from your PC. I got a pair from ASUS for $50 bucks and I'm thrilled so far. The set comes with a nice case too so I don't sweat putting them in my laptop bag."
4,for that low price -> perfect,"I don't have troubel atall with this headset. If you don't want to spend much it is perfect.The only thing I could complain of, is that it is not really comfortable, but since I don't use it much and I didn't want to spend a lot of móney I don't really care about it."
4,Good product,"I really liked this product. I use it to make phone calls on my computer. The only thing with those kinds of mics is that the voice does not go directly into your ear, rather, it dispenses a little bit into the air as it does not press on your ear. This means that the voice is less intense. However, this has nothing to to with this specific headphone. I really liked it! It is comfortable and easy to store."
2,these slid off my ears - no way to adjust the neckband,"These would have to fit just right around the back of the head to the ears in order to work. The arc of the neckband was too wide so the earpieces kept sliding off my ears from not having enough tension to hold them in place. Since there is no way to make fitting adjustments (cannot bend or re-shape the band), I had to return them.The sound quality was fine and I did not get to test the microphone. This review is just for the problem of fit and no available way to adjust the neckband."
1,COMPLETELY WORTHLESS,"I went through TWO of these and decided not to give this product any more chances. Both lasted less than one week. The first completely died within five days, while the other started transmitting heavy bass and feedback on the sixth day. The most disappointing aspect of my experience is that I own a desktop computer. This means that my headset lays stationary on my DESK--isolated from environmental impairment--yet the product had still managed to malfunction on its own...on two accounts. This product is far too unreliable to make valuable use out of it."
2,Cord is very fragile,I ran over the cord of this thing with my office chair wheel (on carpet and I only weigh about 100 lbs) and that was enough to kill it. Not very durable.
2,Bad microphone,The microphone does't work properly. You can hardly hear me talking clearly (a lot of noise) if I use this microphone to make internet chat. I'm sure it's not my problem with the setup. The earphone works well though.
4,Great headset for the price,"I bought this just to use the microphone (I preferred to listen to conversations on the speakers) for use with google voice/skype.Things I like:- Microphone works pretty well. I've made about 5 calls and none had issues. Calls were clear (according to the recipient). I also recorded myself speaking and everything seemed fine)- The design of the headset is very ergonomic.- The connectors are nice (two 3.5 mm, one for mic and other for headphones) and wire is long.Things I dislike:- Sound quality (for listening) is terrible. I use speakers to listen to conversations because of the bad sound quality, so I guess a desktop microphone would have better served my needs. Also, listening to music is really bad quality. I can't even stand listening to music on this thing."
3,"Great, While it lasted","It was great for about. 3 months until the microphone came out of the side, for no apparent reason, the recording quality is okay, and the headphones are great"
4,Great for the price,Got as a gaming headset. Mic and speakers work well. A little uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time though.
1,Makes my ears bleed. Literally.,"Despite others complaining about durability, sound, and mic issues, I have personally not had any of those problems.My problem is with the way the product is designed: the cheap plastic neckband that pinches on your ears is open-ended and somewhat sharp on the bottom. Prolonged wear actually cuts my ear, making me bleed.Do not buy this product please."
5,great product,I've been using this headset for about a year and a half now and its still working and in good shape. it's very sturdy and im very pleased at how this headset stood the test of time.
3,"Fun, Lovecraftian throwaway.","Only The End of the World Again is a very brief supernaturally-themed graphic novel (more of a ""short story"" really) by Sandman/Coraline author Neil Gaiman. It isn't particularly substantial, but it was quite fun to read. The art is globular and cartoonish with wavy outlines contributing to a a very deranged sense of perspective (more like Squiggle-Vision than the art on the cover!). The plot involves a werewolf and a kraken."
4,Every shark aficionado should have this book,"I'm fascinated by sharks, and so glad I bought this book. It provides an interesting account of sharks and their evolution, and highlights how little we still know of them through first-hand accounts. It can get slightly bogged down in science for a purely casual reader, but provides a wealth of interesting information all the same. It also goes a long way toward dispelling media myths, and recognizing sharks -- with reverence and respect rather than condemnation -- for what they are: apex predators par excellence. Buy this book!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!,"I agree with everyone who has had problems with this product. Just because it says Cuisinart on the label, does NOT mean you are getting a quality product!!! I used the blender to puree cooked vegetables and make smoothies, about 10 times max. Then the motor burned out. It never did a good job blending food before it crapped out. For the price paid and the brand name, you'd think you would get years of service. YOU WILL NOT! Do NOT buy this product. Repeat, do NOT buy this product! I contacted Cuisinart and they said for about $20 in shipping, I could return it and they would fix it or replace it. Why would I want to do that? It will only burn out in a few more uses. I'm better off applying the $20 to a new blender. And you can bet it will NOT be a Cuisinart!!!!! If you are on the fence about whether or not to buy this product.........DON'T!!!!!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY!!!!,Bought The 1st One At Kohls Got A Really Great Deal. I Took It Home To Make A Smoothie & It Went Out On Me After One Use. I Went Back To Kohls & Exchanged It For A New One. Went Home To Make A Smoothie And It Worked Fine. Went To Use It Another Time & It Burnt Out While Making A Smoothie AGAIN! I Am So MAD! I Gotta Take This One Back Too! Do Not Buy This Blender! Listen To The Reviews!
4,So far so good!,"The first two weeks with this blender have been a joy! It crushes ice, makes awesome smoothies and blends veggies for soup without a problem. I did fill it almost to the entire capacity of the jar several times and no smell of burned plastic or a dying motor yet. I use it about twice a day. I make a green drink in the morning and a soup in the afternoon. So far it has handled every job that I saw at a demonstration of a $450 Vitamix with ease.. I don't want to jinx it (having looked at all the 1 star reviews here) but it feels like a really good value and a solid product. I take away one star for an annoying drawback which is a poor design of the jar. Forget about using the little lip to pour the contents out - all you'll achieve will be a big mess. You have to use a corner instead. Wrap a paper towel around the outer wall of the corner you are using because there will be some spillage no matter how careful you are."
1,Do NOT buy this product!!!,"I used this product approximately 5 times and the ""clutch"" broke...translated the rotary blade in the jar wouldn't spin. I called Cuisinart for a parts replacement, but I had to pay for shipping both ways...they wouldn't send me the part. I decided to reinvest in another blender and chucked this one."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Wow, I got mine for Christmas and used it a total of 3 times...it's done! I was crackin' up as I read the reviews! I make smoothies as well....this thing SUCKS! I got a Cuisinart because I thought they were hi end....I hope everyone checks out these reveiws before they decide to grab one...I've never owned a Cusinart before, but this model is terrible!"
1,My days ruined!,"I was all excited about recieving this blender for a birthday present & when after buying all these ingredients to make hummus, I started mixing it in the blender & in 10 minutes I smelled the smell of a burnt out motor & sure enough it died then & there.I don't know if I'll even bother getting another blender cause I had another slightly cheaper one recently made by Proctor Silex that I got 2 full uses out of it before that one died so that assures me that today's quality is crap compared to old school.The Kitchen my partents had lasted for decades!Don't throw away reciept & packing box if you buy this blender!!!"
2,Not enough power for the huge container,"Do not be deceived by the 56 ounce container, there is not enough power in the motor to puree that much product. The blender will work OK if you only fill the container about 1/3 of the way full, but then what's the point of paying extra for this large capacity? My ancient Oster blender worked better. Admittedly the old Oster is smaller, and maybe not having to work so hard per batch. My plan was to purchase a larger capacity machine to get through projects faster. I'm processing oven-baked pumpkin - it's soft enough to mash with a fork, but there is a lot of it. This large Cuisinart machine just takes up more space - I'm still having to process small batches of food at a time.When I called Cuisinart, they were very polite, but they basically just said ""yeah, it won't do that much"". I wish I'd known that before I forked over the cash... it would have gone quite a ways towards a Kitchenaid..."
2,You can find a better deal elsewhere,"Not recommend. Very disappointed.Pro- Good quality by Cuisinart. Durabilaty is good. liked glass jar and stainless steel blade.Con- the bottom of a jar leaked at the first time I used it, yet the exchange process was fast but inconvinent beacuse I had to go to the post office with three kids to ship the old one back. Also, it leaks side of a jar when you pour any blended drink with ice. The pitcher is very heavy."
4,Great quality blender!,I use my blender daily for smoothies and frozen protein shakes and this blender works perfect for them. It breaks up the ice and frozen fruits perfectly! It also allows for a smooth and clean pour. The only problem I had was when I put it in the dishwasher and the top got slightly worpt. However I contacted the customer service and they sent a new one with no hassle.
5,Creating the Good Will,Very good reading. Very thought provoking. Helped me to think through areas that had previously been perceived problems. Helped me to answer many questions that I had been asking myself. I feel the insight that this book has helped me to uncover will be most helpful as I prepare an updated will (with my lawyer). It will help me make better decisions concerning the best way for me to leave my estate...and thus leave less hard feelings about how I leave my estate.
3,Phantom ball with out NCAA approval,I got this ball expecting it to be very high quality ball. Instead it had a pretty bad defect in the stitching and I noticed it does not have the NCAA stamp of approval like the old Phantom Brine balls. The stitching also looked kind of rough. I played with it once and it seemed to fly smooth and over all it's not bad. But not what I expected. The company did give me a full refund and let me keep the ball. So kudos there.
3,Fell bellow my expectations...,"I researched this ball a lot, and bought it for about $50 at a local sporting goods store. I am reviewing the ball, not the seller. I wanted to like this ball. I wear Adidas Copa's and thought a Brine ball would be the classical equivalent in a ball to my classic boots. I haven't been impressed. I want to like this ball, I tried to like this ball...but I can't. It's just not enjoyable to play with. Headers are dangerous and the ball just won't pop off my foot like I had hoped. I have since purchased the Brine NCAA Championship Ball, which looks very similar, but trust me it is much better and you can find it for only about ten dollars more...go with the Brine NCAA Championship ball...[...]"
1,Not a size 5,"I ordered this item as a gift for my boyfriend. Upon opening it, he said he thought it was too small, even though it says ""size 5"" on it. We even measured it, and just as he though, it was too small. It was more like a size 4. Size 5 soccer balls should be about 27-28 inches in circumference, this ball was only 26 inches when fully inflated (size 4 balls are 25-26 inches around).I would not recommend wasting your money or time."
4,This is not your father's opera.,"Demonic possession, hysterical nuns, Grand Inquisators and not-so-invisible invisible spirits all make this an opera that no one could sleep through. Add a crisp, clear production and some of Prokofiev's wildest and spookiest music and this thing is a hoot."
2,Good for about 3 seconds,"For the 3 seconds the flavor lasts (the outside strawberry flavored gum mixed with a lime liquid center) it's pretty enjoyable. After that, it's all downhill. Not since chewing Fruit Strips gum as a child, can I remember a gum losing flavor this quickly. You maybe get 5-10 minutes of flavor and after that it's like chewing rubber.The packaging is another annoyance it's a foil blister pack with a cardboard sleeve containing nine pieces of gum. It's a waste of packaging if you consider the whole thing could have been put in a Mentos-like package.I made the mistake of buying a 3 pack. If you must, go with a single pack. It will be enough to turn you off."
1,Don't waste your money,"Very little useful information. Buy Robert Harley's Complete Guide to High End Audio, it's much better."
5,great tire,"Thsi tire worked very well in the dry hard ground of PA. After putting 35 miles on it, it still looks great."
5,What a Fun Book!!!!,This author has a great sense of humor and really knows dogs. Great book to read to your kids and to your dog - both will love it.
4,Very good!,"My granddaughter just got a new puppy and she could read these stories to her new puppy! The stories are cute, short and at an appropriate reading level for a 6 year old!"
5,Very good condition,"This book arrived to my house in excellent condition, and its a fun book to read to children. I loved this one and all the others to go along with it."
4,Good choice for a Gaijin in Tokyo,"I bought this book in the US before moving to Tokyo for two months. I have found it very satisfactory. The maps are good, and the information seems accurate. I didn't try to track down particular restaurants or hotels mentioned in the guide, but it gave me a good sense of what was in each neighborhood and whether or not I should bother trying to see it. I have been very happy with this book and would definitely buy it again and/or recommend it to others."
4,Getting started in Tokyo,"Spent a lot of time leafing through most of the available books on Tokyo in a local bookstore and ""Time Out Guide to Tokyo"" was definitely one of the best ones in terms of presentation and quality of content. Having said that, don't plan to rely solely on this book for your trip. At best, this is a good reference book to read on your plane ride over to get a feeling for the neighborhoods and available attractions. The book provides brief but useful summaries (a couple of pages each) of each neighborhood and major attractions in each area. Beyond that, you're on your own. I would have loved to see more information on history of each neighborhood along with suggested sightseeing routes around the city."
5,Probably the best of the recent guides,"My husband and I go to Japan often, and I wind up buying each new edition of this guide, (which is probably unnecessary) because I want to stay current on things, especially the restaurant and hotel reviews. The information is fairly comprehensive, very good for shopping, museums and galleries, though not strong on the traditional arts such as Kabuki, traditional music, etc.The old Kodansha Guide was better, but it's not being published anymore, so this is your best bet. I gave one to a friend who just went to Japan, and she loved it."
4,"Sent wrong book, but was nice enough to refund money","Ordered the Time Out Travel Guide to Tokyo. They sent a completely different book, but was nice enough to give me a full refund and allowed me to just donate the wrong book to charity. Nice customer service."
5,EXCELLENT,"YOU must try ""Grandmother's caramel icing"" recipe in this book. It is worth the price just for this recipe!!!"
1,Game NOT compatible with GeForce MX440 card,"I wish the facts had been provided on this site before purchasing the game as there was nothing I could do (other than buy a new graphics card for my computer which I did not want as I do not play too many computer games). I ended up buying a PS2 and love it. So, if your computer has a GeForce MX440 graphics card, it is either time to upgrade, or you will NOT be able to play this game. Such a disappointment as I had waited SO long for this game to be released in the PC format."
2,"Not really too good, not recommened",I really did not see too much in this game. I would not recommend it.
1,Requirements are false,"The box says PC-DVD, when it's actually a CD-ROM game. What's worse, the requirements state that you need a GeForce3 or better, with GeForce4MX not supported. Where on scAmazon.con does it say that? How was I supposed to know this before buying. Now I have a game that I can't play without buying new harware. Jive Turkey. It does, however, say that the game is published by Atari, when it's actually published by Acclaim. Could the information about this game be any more misleading? The acclaim site doesn't even really acknowledge the PC release. Don't waste your money."
3,Mixed signals,"I bought this game today thinking it was going to be really great. I got it home and found the requirements along with it saying it was a dvd were false. There was too much false info on the box to make me even wonder if i should play the game. I wonder how many more boxes like the one i have got shipped like this in the U.S. The only problem i have is with the manufactures double requirements, I dont have a problem with the game."
4,Tale of a Cambridge Cat,"Philip J. Davis, the author, is Professor of Applied Mathematics at Brown University. In the mid 1980s, he was briefly a Visitor at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where his (fictional) tale is set.I recommend the book highly. It provides great insight into the traditional methods of study and reflection used within Cambridge colleges, and Thomas Gray the cat is a most engaging fulcrum who effortlessly imposes her (that's right!) personality upon the direction matters take. Philosophy, history, love and mathematics all come together in a Cambridge environment where the landscapes are as lovingly described as the abstract ideas."
3,Space craft Dynamics,I think the author has omited some relations between the equations he has obtaind. He'd better to expand relations more.
1,Wait until Hell freezes over,"I have no qualms with the recipes, which are easy to prepare and far tastier than one finds in other cookbooks. My distaste for America's Test Kitchen is customer service, which they do not offer.After asking for a large quantity of DVDs, I waited.After two months and only after enquiring about my order, I was told that they had been back-ordered.After two months longer and only after enquiring about my order, I was told that there simply weren't any more available.I see. Business must be so good that there is no need to even contact or please the customer. Fine. My money walks."
4,Gems in an adequate setting,"This was a television special broadcast in 1991. It melds two of my all-time favorite cartoons, ""The Rabbit of Seville"" and ""What's Opera, Doc?"", along with ""Baton Bunny"" and some framing sequences including Granny, Sylvester, the three bears, and Yosemite Sam. There's also an original bit with Daffy, Porky, and the William Tell Overture.The show tries to run the cartoons seamlessly into the action, so the original titles and credits are gone from each. I was most disappointed that ""Rabbit"" ended without Bugs' original punchline, ""Next?"" Still, it's nice to get Bugs' best orchestral works all under one roof.Small bonus: The opera soloist heard during the closing credits comes from ""Long-Haired Hare"", another great musical Bugs cartoon."
2,Not Much of Anything,"part of the problem is that it's a little bit of everything so it's really not much of anything.While there are meditative chill tracks for lounging in a spa or in a deprevation tank, there are more upbeat tracks that ruin that relaxation mood.But they're not so really upbeat or polished enough to qualify as real chill tracks.There are some elements of new age instrumentation but it's not really New age music - there are tracks tat qualify as ambient or as minimalist chill but scattered throughout other tracks.It's a hodge-podge so if thatt's what you want - if you're looking for tracks to make a mix, this might work for you but keep in mind it's a little of a bunch of different things but not much of really anything."
3,not a bargain,"I read in one review that there was a language issue with tech support. I had the same unpleasant experience. Finally just terminated the conversation. My unit came with no local map, just the interstate system. It aquired position right away. but still quite useless. after reading the review about the extended warranty biz? I think I'm sending this puppy back. Did you know you can get a phone with a gps in it for about two fifty? I looked at them in a verizon store this weekend."
4,A great first GPS,"If you have ever rented a car from Hertz with neverlost, you already know how to use this GPS. I found it very simple to use, and pretty accurate. The route may not always be the one you would choose from a map, but it does get you where you are going, and does a great job of recalculating the route when you venture off the indicated route."
4,The Trip,"We purchased the Magellan GPs system to take on our cross country (Washington to Pennsylvania to Florida to Washington) trip in September, 2006. It was very helpful in guiding us to motels, places to eat, shopping, etc. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Deal for a price but not a product worth buying,"Have been using the GPS for past 3 months. Used it in miami, hawaii, boston, new york and new jersey. Its not very accurate on the map nor the POI's. I have taken alternate route number of times because of the GPS giving wrong directions.But if you are in a budget, its a good buy."
4,"Great GPS, Poor mount","I have had this GPS for about a month, and it is extremely easy to use and had minimal set up. So far it has gotten me about 20 places with pretty good directions. The only problem I can see with it is with the cheap design of the mounting hardware. Mine is already broken and I have resorted to industrial strength velcro on the dash."
1,"No maps, No support","No detailed maps on the unit for the Washington DC area or any other for that matter. Called tech support and they promised to send out a SD card. That was over a month and five calls to tech support ago and I'm still waiting.Amazon agreed to take it back, and I'll buy another unit from amazon, but it won't be a Magellan. Tech support is lower than low. Shouldn't be that hard to send an SD chip and I don't appreciate being lied to repeatedly when they can't."
1,A waste of money!,This factory refurbished model 360 GPS worked for about ten hours. Initially it worked fine. It then failed to pick up the satellite signal or would loose the signal as a drove along on a trip. I called tech support for help twice. The service personnel are very difficult to understand and they also have trouble understanding me. It is a language issue. They suggested various tests and reprogramming but it did not correct the problem. The unit was fifteen days past the 90 day warrantee so they wanted me to ship back the unit and charge me $144.00 to examine it. I can't afford to pour any more money down that hole for ten hours of service. Stay away from the refurbished unit and don't buy a new unit without an extended warrantee.
3,"finally, the real story","if you're intersested in the real true crime novel this is the book. while helter sketer was entertaining, it didn't provide the background this book does. sanders deals with this subject with a sence of ironic humor that makes this book easier to enjoy(the subject matter is of course brutal) but this is historically an important part of the 60s. sanders leaves nothing out. you get a real sence of manson as a man, not the urban legend/monster other books turned him into. that's what makes this book terrifying, the fact it makes him a real person. from a litteral,historical, and phycological point of view, this is a most for any true crime fan. this book will ""creepy crawl"" into your subconcience"
3,"More Manson, et al.","A decent read, but not something I would spend a lot of time trying to get a hold of.Brings a different ""light"" to the Manson Family, though I suspect that it's not exactly 100% true.If you're building a true crime library, add this to your Manson collection. If you're just looking for the Manson story stick with Helter Skelter."
1,Really hard to take this book seriously.,"First of all, this was the only book that linked the Family to animal sacrifices and the drinking of Dog's blood. Now, for us who know the family, we know that they were not only animal loves, but some were even activists on the issues. Ed Sanders introduced many absurd theories, stories and scenarios but never gave sources. Generally he'd just say ""the source wanted to remain anonymous"".It's sad that this book is full of such BS, because the stories of Manson's dune buggy assembly line, the nomadic ways of the family, and life in Death Valley were not only in depth, informative, but very, very interesting. It was more or less a day-by-day account of the days leading up to the murders, and the days in the desert before the arrests.My caution is if you read this book, to try and weed out the bull crap and keep in mind that this guy claims to have spend weeks with the Family, but actually it was only like a day."
5,Repair or replace?,"""This is a nice heat gun for the money. But be aware... you DO NOT get the case or the nozzle adapters! This item is for the HEAT GUN ONLY! Kind of a false advertisement if you ask me!""Why, did it used to show the case and adapters with the add? It doesn't now.Actually I am rating this based on my 30 year old one. I can't speak for this newer model, it may have changed I don't know, but I have a HG-501LJ, which uses the same spare parts, that is about 30 years old and ran strong under heavy abuse until someone in the shop broke off both brush holders. I am trying to decide whether to get it repaired for $45 or or get a new one. I think I will do both, repair the 500-750 model and get a new 750-1000 one."
2,What you see is NOT what you get!,This is a nice heat gun for the money. But be aware... you DO NOT get the case or the nozzle adapters! This item is for the HEAT GUN ONLY! Kind of a false advertisement if you ask me!
2,does anyone else have a sticking problem??,I like this leash - I really do. It's great - the only thing I don't like is how it keeps sticking. It's usually when I have to have the dog on a shorter length while crossing the road - I click the trigger and get to the other side and it won't move. I stand there fiddling with the thing for ever and give up and then some how after letting it set for a 1/2 hour I can get it to go again - which doesn't help our walk.
2,Works fine until leash breaks,Worked fine until the cord broke. As with so many products the manufacturer would rather you buy a new one that be able to fix it yourself. The non-standard screw heads prevented me from attempting to repair the broken leash. I guess it's now heading for the landfill.
1,poor quality,Owned it for 6 months and then it wouldn't retract. I thought paying a little more would give me quality but no it did not. I have a ten pound puppy and it broke. Never again will I purchase this product.
3,Fixed my walkabout,"The leash on my walkabout broke off just below the clasp. I saw my dog chewing there before it broke. The leash retracted into the case and the odd screws made it impossible to take apart, who owns a set of ""V"" shaped srewdrivers? Nothing to lose so I decided to pry the case apart where the slot is located. I wasn't that hard to pry it there and remove the plastic and metal slot from the case. I re-feed the leash through the slot put the slot back in the case and snapped the case back together. A little black duct tape around the case and my walkabout is almost as good as new. Worth a try."
2,disappointing,"had this leash for a few months to walk a 40 pound dog. It was great until the leash broke in the middle of a walk. Compared to my previous leash that was cheaper and lasted 2 years, this is a disappointment."
5,Very durable leash!,"We recently bought two of these leashes for our two Golden Retrievers and I was amazed by the quality and durability. It's extremely comfortable to hold and it retracts very smoothly. In my opinion, these are much better than Flexi leashes, which we also have, but don't use anymore since getting these. The Flexi leashes would frequently get caught or stuck when trying to retract them and just weren't nearly as comfortable to hold. The Walkabout is the best retractable leash I have ever owned. Our two Goldens are both about 70 pounds and these leashes hold them just fine. If you are looking for a solid, good quality retractable leash for a large dog, I would highly recommend this!"
5,sanding a door,"This was the first time I was using a sander for a project. I sanded a door, and it was really easy.The sander worked great for its price.I would recommend it!"
5,Amazing Product,"I'm a weekend woodworking beginner... and I have to say, the Dewalt D2645K 3-Amp 5-in Random Orbit Sander is absolutely amazing. I was debating whether or not to get the 6in random orbital from RIGID because I heard it had a better feeling/ease of use. Needless to say... For a beginner... I absolutely love this product. I have already re-sanded my whole porch and am on the way to resealing it tonight. Very good! I would also recommend using a Shop Vac hookup as dust collection within the gears tends to buildup after 4ft of sanding a 2/4 plank. But... All in all... I would recommend this wholeheartedly. Can't wait to use it on a kayak building project I have in mind"
1,too much vibration,I bought this sander to replace my old orbital sander. The vibration was so great that I had difficulty keeping it on the wood. Returned it after only my second time trying to use it.
3,Good at sanding; lousy at dust collection,"I've had this product-- or a really similar model -- for well over five years. The pad has now given up the ghost, and I'd be tempted to just replace it and keep on chugging except for the whole dust collection issue. The cloth bag isn't fantastic at preventing fine dust from escaping, but what's really bad is the attachment mechanism of the bag to the machine. It's a simple twist-on arrangement that would fairly frequently detach during use, sending clouds of dust everywhere and of course creating a mess as the partly-full bag would fall on the bench or floor. Also, emptying the bag creates large amounts of dust-- you can't tap it on the edge of a wastebasket, since it's a fabric-covered spring, so you kind of have to squeeze it, releasing more clouds of dust. So I think I'm going to skip the new pad and move on to something with better on-board dust collection."
5,Great Product,"Dewalt always has a great product, and I would give the D26451K a 5 star rating.However, I found the same sander at Lowes or Home Depot at the same price or even cheaper than Amazons price."
2,Too much vibration & very noisy,"Too much vibration, and very noisy. I am seriously considering returning this product simply because of the vibration and noise. It is a great product otherwise but if your hand goes numb from the vibration and you go deaf it's a little too much to bear. I had used an older model Dewalt about 5 years ago and neither of these concerns was an issue. I'm not happy. I should have gone and tried it out in a store first."
5,worth the money.,My wife and I have built a custom juniper log home and used this sander a lot. I works great and I or my wife have no complaints.
5,Typical Dewalt product.,This is a typical Dewalt product. Quiet and does the job well. I had been buying cheaper sanders and they didn't last long.
2,the switch is junk,"I have read other reviews here about the switch being bad, doesnt anybody at dewalt ever follow this and see what customers are saying about your products and then fix the problems? The sander is good but the switch is a piece of s*** pardon the french. Also to Amazon forward this to dewalt. Garver brown Chetek WI"
1,Don't expect much,"The D26451 is a poor replacement for the D421. It is poorly balanced and harder to control, leaving swirl marks in the work. Like the D421, it is equipped with a CFS disc to control speed when not in contact with the work piece, a part that the owners manual calls ""consumable and in need of occasional replacement"". In the case of the D421, Dewalt discontinued carrying the replacement disc only a few years after introducing the D421. So don't be surprised when your new sander is rendered useless because Dewalt discontinued the $5 part that's designed to wear out."
5,DEALT Orbital Sander,Received item on time and it was exactly as described. Have absolutely no complaints.
1,"Misleading advertisement, missing plastic carrying container",I did not get the item as advertised. The advertised product clearly states and shows a picture of a hard plastic carrying case. What has received was a flimsy cloth carrying bag. I am satisfied with the sander but the product clearly was not what was advertised.
1,An Orbital sander that doesn't Orbit,"I expected more from a name like Dewalt. Took it out of the cool rugged case & the blasted thing turned on, revved up a lot of noise (as it should) but it wasn't spinning. I had the same problem with my Black & decker Jug-handle Orbital sander."
2,Wasteful and needlessly expensive,"Compared to a 1/4 sheet sander, this ""hook & loop"" sander is an environmental and economic folly. The sandpaper costs around three times as much as standard sheet-cut paper, and the throw-away paper itself uses more material - one half of the 'hook and loop' fasteners. This sander will cost you a lot more to use than a comparable 1/4 sheet sander, and it will contribute needless extra waste to our already strained environment. I'm using a DeWalt D46221K which produces great results - and does a good job collecting its own dust - without the added financial and environmental burden.That said, I'm sure this is another reliable and highly effective DeWalt product. It's just a shame to see palm sanders move towards greater environmental irresponsibility and pricier sandpaper."
3,Too much vibration,"This sander does a good job, but has a lot more vibration than any other palm sander and I have used Bosch, Porter cable and Milwaukee. I purchased 2 palm sanders and prefer the milwaukee. This Dewalt is very uncomfortable when working on a large area."
1,BROKE after 2 months from purchase!!,"I bought this in December 2011 and it stopped working in February 2012. I refinish furniture as a hobby and during my 4th project I turned it off to take a short break. When I went to turn it back on it would not restart. I waited a couple of hours and it still would not restart. I thought maybe there was something wrong with the electrical outlet so I tried different outlets and it still didn't work. Needless to say I am not happy with this product. I bought it from Lowes Home Improvement, but I doubt that I will get a refund since it's been two months and I didn't purchase the extended warranty. I will not be replacing with another Dewalt sander, that's for sure."
5,Made sanding very easy,"This is a great little sander, I am very happy with this make life easy. Buy this sander you will not be disapointed"
4,nice sander,"This sander worked well taking a few cabinets down to bare wood for refinishing. Works best horizontal sanding, a bit heavy for vertical work. Changing sanding discs is quick and easy. Especially like the shop vac port which made for very little dust."
4,Good Orbital Sander,Does the job but I still like my old Porter Cable better. The Porter Cable is more aggressive but doesn't numb your hand as fast as the Dewalt does.
2,Interesting research,One problem with this book is that it refutes other forms of cooperative altruism such as reciprocal altruism instead of combining them with the theory and expanding upon them. The Handicap Principle is one of a few theories on explaining cooperative behavior in different species and the authors here give it a good starting point to their theory. It seems that several theories stemming from evolutionary research need to use the cooperation they often rave about and come together to overcome their flaws.
3,Don't take it for granted,"The guide is good and will help any visitor to NYC to get along much better than without a guide. The truth is that even though the book is helpful, if you are used to travel with Frommer's books and never switched to Fodor's, I think there's no need to change. As a Frommer's brand buyer, I missed some features and easy reading when traveling with this book. However, This Fodor's book excells in 2 things, first, the full color photos at the beginning of the book are very inspiring, and second: the post-it flags included are a unique handy feature that will help you to highlight your most important sections of the book."
3,MORE OF THE SAME,"Monette is eloquent as always. However, the theme is tired, worn out and depressing."
3,GOOD INFORMATION,"I was glad to be able to get to know him better through reading this book, In Goode Faith.Wish more people could read this one.lGood Black History - IN GOODE FAITH."
4,TWICE AS GOOD,"Two big names in music (though under-appreciated in the USA) get together on this CD in a style that compliments the other. James Last fabulous big band tones down a notch to make adequate room for Claydermans fine piano work on some songs, while the reverse is true on others. The result is a pleasant blend of both artists best sounds.....easy listening arrangements of 18 mostly familiar songs and a few that were new to me."
3,Where is Dollar Bill?,"They left out one of their best songs ""Dollar Bill"" off this album that was on mixtapes."
3,213- The Hard Way.. Average Release...,"213's release ""The Hard Way"" quietly dissappoints long-time fans of the West Coast rap style. Although listening to Snoop, Warren G and Nate Dogg is always entertaining, nothing seems to stand out too much on this release. There is definately no ground breaking material offerred on The Hard Way. However, this release does provide a sound that takes the listener back a decade or so, which helps give some of us that grew up listening to this music, a reason to flash back to memories of curb ball, bbq's and straight pimping Time Magazine style. Whatever that means.The best tracks to download: My Dirty Ho, So Fly (my favorite), Run on Up and Groupie Luv.Worst Tracks are- Intro, Joysticc and 213 Tha Gansta Clicc.Everything else is average."
2,tired&to Late,"now it's cool the Cats do a Tribute to Rick James with ""Mary Jane"" but it like most of the album seems to be to full of clody Smoke. had this Set dropped 10 years back or even 7 years back then it would have gotten over a bit better. Snoop,Nate&Warren G have Chemistry,but the Material here seems for the most part like it's been in the vault for a good while."
2,Oldies are played out,"After listening to THe hard way, i was disapointed from such a hot crew. Its old school vibe is played out. NOt good for the new age. OLd beats, and i was looking for the new beats, and i think most people are too."
3,Could have been a super album with this talent,Sad that this did not achieve what should have been - three high school classmates hit it big individually in the rap game and pull together to do the album that they wanted...R.I.P. Nate Dogg. Warren G - you rock!
5,Real Mellow,"I am not usually a fan of rap music but this album is so chill and laid back. It is a break from the Lil John ""Crunk"" music that floods the airways. This is an album you could clean ya house or ya car to and most of all light up to. They did a good job with this one."
1,"Same old stuff, nothing new !!!","If you are looking for some secret squat techniques,look elsewhere. What you buy in this spiral bounded so called ""book"" are just plain common techniques that are known to almost anyone in the gym. The nutrition, stretching chpaters ....are materials written by many authors before and the materials are absolutely nothing new but rather very, very common knowledge and information."
2,Very boastful title; little new substance,"While Mr. Sobe's premise is interesting -- client relationships are developed through the sequence: expert-inner circle-trusted advisor; his approach to following that path is filled with clichés (e.g. client loyalty = value + trust + going the extra mile) and generic terms (e.g. becoming an expert requires you to: (1) do it faster; (2) do it better; (3) be different; (3) be better prepared ...). He continuously uses terms such as trust, integrity, rapport, but fails to put them together into coherent algorithms or work programs to allow the reader to understand how to work through the author's ""expert-inner circle-trusted advisor"" paradigm.Nothing new here."
5,childs swing,it is strong and works really wellhappy with purchasegranddaughter just loves itjust some boat rope and it was upit is strong too and can be sed by an older child
5,"Pleased,",We chose this because of the great price. The quality is good. They came quickly so we were delighted.
3,Wrong Color,"I needed a blue seat, and although the lighting in the image makes the seat look blue, it is actually ""tire-rubber"" black. It was easy to return, but the deceptive image cost me time and non-refundable shipping fees (to me and then back again to them). The product itself is otherwise as pictured and appears durable. Hopefully this review will help someone else from making the same mistake I did."
3,not satisfied,Although I did get y swings in a timely manner they were not the color i was expecting according to the picture they were blue and the ones i got were a charcoal black/grey color
1,Check Compatibility,"Could not get it to work. After signficant time with tech support (who didn't inspire confidence), I was told that the server is not compatible with my printer, which is a couple of year old."
4,Good?Bad?Ugly?...Mostly good!!,So now on this album my boy Bushwick is missing in action and it comes after the classic Resurrection cd. I really wondered how it would sound without Wick on it and to my surprise it came out very good. To fill the void they showcased a lot of Rap-A-Lot talent on almost every song. This worked for the most part but sometimes takes away from the vibe of the cd. Lyrically Face and Willie D are still on point and Wiliie D switches his style up on this one. DMG really steps up to the plate and hits homeruns on songs he apperas on.Every great group has to have one album being the least favorite and this is the one. But this album is still better than a lot of other cd's from other artist. Ghetto Boys have no weak albums lets get that str8 but this may be the last on everyone's ranking list.Key tracks:Livin 4 The MomentEye 4 An EyeFreeB***hes & HoesGangsta (Put Me Down)Gun In Your Mouth
4,geto boys are always coming w\fresh new lyrics on everyalbum,geto boys are always coming with fresh new lyrics. on every album they have a new style but remain true to their fans. they are one of the true southern hip-hop pioneers.
2,"been there, done that ...",Yet another unimaginative gangsta rap offering. Can anyone bring anything new to this tired genre? Guess I'll place my hopes on the upcoming Method Man joint.
3,a positive message for young girls,"This non-fiction book discusses beauty inside and out. This book gives simple, honest advice to young girls and teaches them how to accept and love themselves just the way they are.Scripture quotations are frequently used throughout the book to re-enforce the messages illustrated by the author and the fun magazine style quizzes are prefect for getting the point across.Although the idea behind this book is great and I liked the positive message it carried I'm not sure the layout would be appealing to younger girls. The girly illustrations dotted throughout help but otherwise I can't see it holding the attention of it's target age group which is a shame as the contents is good.A different book to what I was expecting but one that carries a good, positive message for young girls."
3,"Good, not great.","These were easy to install, only double stick tape. After only a few weeks, the bottom ends near the mirrors are pealing up. There is a plastic cover in this area, not the paint surface like the rest of the door. I did clean them with the alcohol pads in the kit. I will have to remove all the tape and re-stick them now. They do look good."
1,none,"Your picure is misleading. I had ordered the item according to the picure you advertise, i.e a small glass bottle of cologne. Instead I received a huge plastic bottle of watered down cologne. Not very happy."
2,not the product i ordered,"I ordered the Aqua Lavanda cologne in the green glass bottle as shown,,,,but I received a tall plastic squeeze bottle.(very cheap looking) When i complained about it to the seller, they said that the product just comes in the tall plastic bottle. If that is so, they shouldn't advertise it as something they don't have."
2,"Great product, but not real sturdy","I purchased this bearing for a pull out rotating home entertainment center shelve. Everything about this bearing was perfect, the right size and weight handling. However, once I attached the shelving (and only the shelving, no equipment) the bearing allowed the shelves to rock back and forth. The design of my 24 inch tall shelving only allowed for 1/4 of an inch space on either side of the shelves. This bearing was loose enough for the top of my shelves to rock about 2-3 inches either way. Therefore, I could not use this bearing or I would have to be very careful not to bang the shelves on the wall as I was closing the cabinet. I am currently looking for a new bearing or a different method to sturdy the structure."
3,Does the Job,"In the end, this product is working just fine for me. There are some things you should know, though.First, it's a little bigger than 6 inches square, so don't make too many assumptions about how it will fit into your project until you measure it. Second, it is noisy as shipped. I used a thin piece of wood to push some heavy grease between the bearings, and now it is much nicer. Third, the sheet metal is thinner than it looks in the photo. If the bearing will be supporting more than a few pounds, be sure the entire flat area of the bearing rests on a solid surface, not just the corners."
4,Good Epic Poem,"I'm not a big reader of poetry - especiall epic poems. But I do like a goodstory. The author uses some great techniques - foreshadowing, alliteration, etc. I must confess, I haven't finished yet, but I like what I've read so far. I like the story a lot! It's really different and good!"
4,For romantics and poets alike,"I like it. I can follow the characters very easily. But if you do not poetry or any of the romantics or any epic poem, you may not like this. However, I enjoy the good vs. evil and the world this is made in. Ive even showed it to professors Ive had and they enjoyed it as well."
5,Great purchase experience...arrived much earlier than expected.,Great purchase experience...arrived much earlier than expected. Perfect video for little boys who can't get enough of 'garbage trucks'...it's educational too!
4,It's good,"It gives very good tips. I just started preparing for the marathon 2 months ago, and his method has worked perfectly well."
5,He was right - i did it.,"I was a non-athletic (translation: couch potato) half marathon trainee with a lot of doubt. Jeff's straight-forward information, hints, suggestions, and warnings were extremely instrumental in my ability to complete my first half marathon at the age of 50. The book is very readable, well organized and to the point. Jeff accomplishes what he sets out to do: give everyone a good plan for training for a marathon. I highly recommend his work."
3,Good advice but not well written,"I recently read this book beginning to end and have to say that the poor quality of the writing made it hard to follow at times. Galloway repeats the same sentence throughout the book in inappropriate or unexpected places. He is clearly a runner and not a writer.I have to say though, that his advice and methods are sound and will work. I was relieved to find out that I would not be running all 26 miles, but taking short walk breaks to recover. Some of the book sounded a little dated (he never mentions goo as an alternative to Powerbars) but overall it is a good first step for people considering running their first marathon."
3,"Great method, sensible plans, but haphazardly thrown together","I own Galloway's Book on Running, which I think is fantastic. The walk-run method was a revelation to me; I had no idea I could run these kinds of distances in decent times before I tried run-walk-run. That said, the Half-Marathon book, while containing helpful training plans for various half-marathon goals, has a lot of overlap with the Book on Running but is otherwise less compelling in presentation. There's a lot of color photographs and relatively little text, which doesn't seem all that focused on half-marathon running at that. So even if you're a walk-runner and interested in running half marathons, I'd say Galloway's Book on Running is the better investment. Still, three starts for the walk-run method and the training plans."
1,i ordered a six pack but only received one pack from American Wholesalers.,I only got one package of Glide for $21. there was no invoice included. I assume American Wholesalers will send me the remaining five packages but having to complain and follow up is a nuisance.was notified by American that they will send me the missing packages. When I receive them I will change my rating to 5 star
5,Great!,"Does a great job of removing oil without drying out your face. And even after a week of use, my pores look better! I've tried a number of products and this is the best by far."
2,Not as good as expected,"we purchased this item in good faith. we bought the same model as we owned for 20 years. our older model was better by far. our old model had more power and heat. the company seems to have changed the specifications on the new version , it isnt as good as the older model we owned . to say the least we were disappointed."
5,"Its jumping with the 1st song,excellent mixes.",I purchased this cd while I was in Germany. When I came back to America and played my cd many people wanted to know what this great music was. It takes you off your feet and makes you want to dance!
5,child friendly,"My daughter's italic penmanship is beautiful after using this series (finished book D). Her printing is another story, but she finds the italic more efficient. Isn't that the whole purpose?! My goal was efficient legible handwriting that will help her get through speed-of-light college lectures. She started this at age 8.5 and just turned 11.My 8 yo son is still learning. I used this last year and chose to repeat it again this year, although we're doing 2 pages at a time now. Physiologically he just wasn't developed enough, but I'm definitely seeing progress. The only 2 complaints I have is lower case 'e' and 's'. He struggled with 'e' until I decided to have him start with a straight line out and then around. Their ""e"" is just too swirly (if that's a word) without enough guidance. Then there is 's'. Is there any GOOD way of teaching 's'?! I mean, is it just a curvey version of a 5 or what?I wish I had been taught this!"
5,neat and easy!,"I ordered this for my first grader after struggling with handwriting in kindergarten. He likes handwriting now and his writing is neat and easy to read, and best of all he feels good about his writing!"
2,A little too lightweight?,"These don't seem to fit well, a little too loose and being very lightweight doesn't seem to help that. I find them slipping off every now and then. I guess you get what you pay for. Sound quality is fine though."
1,"""Not what they said it would be""","After I order the proper size for my feet, I decided to order a bigger size just in case they were tight on my feet. As soon as I got the product I tried them on and I though I was going to cut off the circulation to my feet..They were so tight they actually hurt to have them on...If you order, try a larger size and wider than you normally use. But the greatest thing was Amazon took them back without a hitch..."
2,A Delicate Boot!,"I liked that there were no strings to get in harms way. The curved sole helped w/ all the walking and I really needed the water-proof feature. I bought these 3mos. ago, the zipper-pull snapped off w/in the first week, two weeks ago the sides split! Now they're wet inside and smell like it! The ""rubber"" is more of a cheap, brittle, plastic! the in-sole mat'l slips around now.The boots work well if you wear them around the house, at your next photo shoot, or perhaps not-at-all! What a waste of hard earned cash! Time for some duct tape, I suppose."
4,Good but could be better,"I was all excited when I received this item. I bought it for my kid in high school. Works as described. Thought, character recognition is not as good.If you are planning to digitize your work, this is the tool. If you are expecting to convert your writting to documents (like word, presentation etc) this is not the tool for you.I am good with the features it offers at this price. Though, I would get a little advanced version for my college kid."
1,product not as advertised,"What you show and what you ship are two different products, no recourse for customer, not using amazon because of this problem. If you can't ship what you show don't ship anything at all and refund money. Ron Marshall"
4,Great show,The uncut version of the show is much better than what was on tv. The fights made more since and the jokes are funnier. If you liked the tv show you will love this.
3,Not what the post said,"It was not ""like new"". The middle piece dvd holder was broken. The dvd's had scratches all over them. They shave skipped maybe twice, though. The box case was raggedy. Plus, it had a yard sale sticker on it selling it at the price of $15 when I had bought it for $40. For five to ten more dollars I could have bought it brand new. I just did not want to pay shipping and handling because I had limited funds. I only like it because it is one of my favorite anime."
2,Not sure who the right audience is for these books,"As a foster parent with RAD-diagnosed kids, I was hopeful that this series would provide a good conversation-starter when trying to help the kids through their feelings. However, I found the books to be beyond the comprehension level of the kids I deal with (mostly pre-teen and younger), with very pat conclusions that are too ""easy"" for adults or older kids. I think the intent of each is good, but the message tends toward ""And after all the trauma and horrible things that happened, the child finally let someone hug him and everything was fine."" We who live with RAD kids know that the lack of someone to love and trust is certainly a big part of how they ""got that way"", but love and trust alone isn't the answer to ""fixing it"", and no ""fix"" is going to be easy or quick. Overall, I like the concept, but not the execution."
4,Smoothness,"Pros : easy to control, maneuver, change pads, and adjust speedCons: on/off switch is easy to accidentally bump during use, hard to empty dust collectorConclusion: refinished a 30 yr old dresser that looks better now than if I bought one from a store. Black and yellow does it again! Thanks dewalt!"
5,Work Saver,"I researched this tool for months. I finally met some folks who actually have this model as well as other brands in their shops. Everyone said they preferred the Dewalt. Overall feel of the machine and the work accomplished made the Dewalt their ROS of choice.I bought one of my own. I totally agree! My first job was restoring an antique drop leaf table. (there so many layers of paint and dings, I wasn't sure there was even wood underneath.) The variable speed come in handy for fine sanding. I borrowed two other brands from my friends, they don't compare to the Dewalt. I would easily recommend this to anyone looking for a great ROS.Old Guy"
4,It does the job nicely,"I've only used the sander a couple of times since buying it but it does a good job. I've used it only on MDF and on black walnut so far. On the walnut, with 150-grit paper, it sanded out burn marks from a router bit quite easily and smoothly without marring the wood. It runs quietly. Only thing I don't like is that I can't find a transition piece to connect the sander's 1.5"" dust outlet port to the 2"" inlet hose on my shop-vac, but the dust bag that comes with it works well as an alternate."
5,Perfect,This tool has definitely gave me my money's worth. I've used it for just about everything and it has never let me down. Mine came with a hard case as this looks to be a soft bag. Maybe they have change
2,"it does sand wood, but.","I replaced my old mouse with this thing. It does sand wood, but the vacuum port does not fit either of my standard vacuums. The bag collects some dust but the motor cooling fan blows stray dust all over the shop like a hurricane! Had a few loose small items on the bench and some plane shavings etc. and the wind from the motor fan did a nice job of clearing off the bench! So the dust collection feature is nothing but a joke. I'll return this unit and go back to my old mouse thank you very much. Don't waste your time carrying this thing home if you need a dust collecting sander!"
5,Love my tool love my wife,"Love my tool,love my wife- but not in that order.Just finished making a workbench for my hitachi miter saw,used the dewalt to sand it - in preparation for gel stain.It works flawlessly,unfortunately my wife likes it too.She would keep sanding until theres no wood left or the sanding disk has been obliterated.....she loves it that much.Glad I'm not wood.Wish all of my tools collected the sawdust as well as the dewalt, nothing to vacuum today.And if you want free projects,minwax has a listing of completely detailed downloadable PDF for beginner to advanced woodworking.on their website.Varathane does not have any,just listings of projects you can stain.Next time I'll buy minwax."
3,Switch problem,"Purchased only yesterday, this sander has switched itself ON spontaneously after being ""off"" for at least ten seconds. This has happened three times unexpectedly, but I can reproduce it regularly. The customer care agent ""never heard of such a thing,"" but there are at least two other similar complaints (see the 1-star reviews) here on Amazon. Dewalt were generous: they encouraged me to swap it out. Since it seemed first class in ever other way, I'll try another one.P.S. The replacement model (D26453K) is performing impeccably after 10 days."
4,Good but the power switch is a pain,I have owned several random orbit sanders over the years and I recently purchased this DeWalt to sand the doors in my house prior to painting. It is the best sander I have used and the dust collection works great. the collection bag caught most of the paint dust and never once fell off. The vibration was easy to control and the variable speed works great.My only complaint is the power switch is VERY touchy and turns on at the lightest touch so make sure to be careful when setting it down.
2,"Ok while it works, lacks wireless encryption options",I bought this camera a little over a year ago and it has worked fine until recently it became unresponsive. The only beef I had with it was that it only supported WEP for wireless encryption which is older and less secure than WPA/WPA2. I would recommend looking for a different network camera as this one wont last long.
4,Good WebCam for the Price,"I have 3 of these webcams in my home. 2 for monitoring my pets and 1 to monitor my basement as I have water problems. I have a wireless network connection via my Laptop. I use the LinkSys Wireless Router.These work very well. I can check in during the day while I'm at work. I can also check in via my CellPhone (Palm Centro) if I am out of town. I was suprised as to how well you can view the image via a cell phone.The only problem I have had, was that the cameras would often be ""offline"". I learned that if I put them all on a timer so they all get a break, then they work just fine. Since you cannot see anything after dark, I just turn mine off with a timer during the night.I plan to get 1 more of these in the near future to monitor my pellet stove."
1,No Mac OS software,"Another reviewer says that the software works ""flawlessly"" in either Windows or Mac, but my box came with just Windows software. So disappointed. Why can't Panasonic make a version that works with a Mac?"
2,Does not last. The unit died a little bit more then one year of usage,"bought in 2007 Sept, died 2009 Jan.It started to turn itself off a couple month back, and went completely dead today. I saw a few similar review. So, buyers beware."
2,Doesn't last,"As so many reviews here say, this camera doesn't last very long. Mine died too, same symptoms. It's also not very good at low-light. I won't be buying another one."
4,Great Camera...no technical support,"I was finally able to get this camera working and like the results so far. You must be fairly technical, the documentation is awful and technical support is a clear joke! The camera will not give full streaming video, the fastest it will update is 3ms or motion control. Understand what you are getting and if you figure out how to get it working, you will be pleased."
3,Excellent unit until it fails,"I have 3 of these cameras, bought over the last two years. I also have a similar Axis model. I use the BL-C20A's ftp-on-motion feature and access them from a Mac wirelessly. At first I thought the Axis was superior, as it has better image quality and MPEG support. But it fails intermittently (needs rebooting) and I've never gotten its motion-detect to work with the right sensitivity. So I settled on the Panasonic and got 3. Unfortunately after about a year, each camera has failed completely -- now all 3! They just die with a flickering orange light or no light at all. Hard reset does nothing. I'm sending them back for repair, but given that all of them died I'm not sure they're worth repairing. Still, I know of no better option, so the BL-C20A may still be the best option at this price level.[SEE COMMENT THREAD FOR USEFUL INFO]"
5,Excellent Camera! and it is wireless under the right settings,"This is a great camera. At first i had problems connecting it wirelessly but after working with a tech support rep from Panasonic we figure out that it was my ""shared"" network setting instead of ""open"". After he told me to change this voila! i was able to setup my three BL-C20 cameras and they are great!"
3,"Good camera, poor wireless","This is a good camera, with good resolution and options. It works really great... As long as it's wired. The wireless feature just didn't work for me, the image kept freezing and I had to reset the camera everytime. I have tried it with 2 different routers so I guess that's not the problem. Anyway if this was the wired version (as I'm using it right now) I probably would have given it 5 stars. I spent a lot more money to get a wireless camera that doesn't work as expected."
5,webcam more than I expected,"I bought the web cam just to try it and see how it worked. It does more than I thought it would. I just wanted a way to keep an eye on my cabin while I'm not there. To look in and make sure everything is ok, etc. The camera works great, and the free web site I can go to to see the cam from anywhere is cool. I didn't realize it had several modes though, but along with live video, you can also set 4 different timers, to either take a still at pre-set times, or to use a motion detector. If you use the timer, and set it for like once a day, you can then go into buffered images and push the ""play"" button, and it's like time laspse photography, which is very cool. I bought this as a gift for my wife, and she truely loves it, which is a bonus in itself."
1,not very reliable in connection,"I am actually very disapointed in this item. As somebody already mentioned in their review, it is working well as long as it is connected, but unfortunately the connection is really not very reliable. I can not view it most of time when I am away. I am not recommending this item. i think b131A is better."
2,Does not work,"It takes me a two whole days to figure out how it can be installed, still not sucessful!!worth 3o bulks, not 130"
5,Unreleased tracks & rarities are great!,"""XX"" mixes the classic sound of the original Toto lineup (with Bobby Kimball) with its later incarnations (with Joseph Williams, then no lead singer). Some songs are demos, some left off of Toto albums for other reasons. All of them are great, though! I would have never left ""Going Home"" off of the Past to Present album, or ""Last Night"" off of Fahrenheit. My favorites: ""Right Part of Me,"" a powerful ballad with an orchestra and a very soulful Bobby Kimball singing, and the live version of ""Africa"" from their tour a couple of years ago--great percussion! ""XX"" is one of Toto's best albums ever!"
5,A gold mine!,"This rarities set by Toto is a gem. The nine unreleased studio tracks show the depths of Toto's talent. ""Goin' Home"" is far, far superior to any of the Byron tracks on ""Past To Present,"" and there are evend two demos, the earliest of Toto recordings. Plus, the live tracks are cool too. If you remember ""Rosanna"", ""Hold The Line"", or ""Africa,"" buy it!"
4,Interesting,"If you are a Toto fan, this album has good music that you can see where their influence comes from. An interesting collection from eras of the band. Glad I bought it."
2,A young Burt Bachrach,"I deceided to take a chance on this CD. It didn't pan out. While Mr. Cincotti has a lot more musical talent than I'll ever possess, I did not find this recording a really enjoyable listening experience. His singing reminds me more of Burt Bachrach than anyone else. He manages to stay on pitch; but his voice is raspy, and he has minimal breath control. When he tries to sustain notes on songs like ""The Rainbow Connection,"" he really, perhaps painfully, struggles. I'm glad this young man has an enthusiastic following in some circles. But I cannot see myself becoming a big fan."
3,Better pianist than singer,"Cincotti is a great pianist. However, his singing is not very original- he sounds like yet another Sinatra wannabe. He's definitely a talented musician and I hope he finds his voice rather than try to emulate Sinatra or Harry Connick Jr."
3,Michael Buble is a step above,"Cincotti is good but not the best. Michael Buble has a voice that makes my heart beat faster whenever I play his CD. His song selections are better than Cincotti, smoother voice and a style all his own."
3,Piano Man,"Pleasant cd.I kept hearing that Peter was like Connick. And he is similar in looks and style, but Connick conveys a more upbeat, interpretive sound.I'd say its a worthwhile purchase. Yes, it's OK."
1,A Legend In His Own Mind,"Since Harry Connick first appeared on the scene, there has beena relentless parade of Sinatra wanta-bees all of which are equalin their lack of musicality, Vocal Ability and overall talent.Peter Cincotti is no different/ He's got nothing to listen too.I heard that Connick is Cincotti's Mentor. This is unfortunate,It should have been Bocelli than we could say it was a case of the blind leading the blind. Save your money and spend it on thereal music!"
1,not too impressed,"in this day of modern music being what it is I was hoping that this young man would have the voice that is needed to sing these wonderful songs. Sad to say I was very disappointed in the singing aspect of this c.d. He seems very talented at his piano playing, maybe next time he can just concentrate on that and leave the singing to another young artist that seems to have a voice made for this style of music. I feel that Peter just does not have the pipes that it takes to make a career out of this genre. Hopefully next time he will just give up the singing."
1,A Star?? Have you Heard Him??,"Don't waste your money folks.. If you want music from this genre try Michael Buble, Dean Martin, or the best of all Bobby Darin..You don't have to take my opionin though.. Just listen to a clip of Michael Buble and then compare it to Peter Cincotti.. Michael wins hands down..My advice for Peter is.. Stay in College.. Have a back up plan.."
1,"Oh, please. More hype.","Shallow, callow, and actually unpleasant to listen to.I literally had to have to ask to have this CD taken off the player at a social gathering. This young man has an indifferent vocal instrument, a derivative, yet strangely undefined style, and, evidently, an ability to charm the press.Let's get real, people. This might make for a great cabaret evening in Paducah. But it AIN'T the real thing."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,I purchased this cd with high hopes. I had read about this cd in a popular Magazine.After purchasing the cd for an enormous amount of money at FYE I listened to it in my car. I was so disapointed.Peter Cincotti's voice is not nearly as mature sounding as other jazz musicians.His track (Are You The One) is the only promising song. His version of Sway is particularly disapointing (but what can you expect from someone who admits he has never heard the song.)Cincotti seems to struggle on all of his songs in tempo and voice clarity. I do not recommend this cd for any true jazz lover. Stick with the master's and forget the poser's.
2,music critic,"just not impressed by this young lads voice, he should just stick to playing the piano. This is where his talent lies."
1,He shoots....he misses,Peter Cincotti is an insult to jazz. He employs worn-out cliches and expects to cover it up with a pretty-boy image and a Harry Connick Jr-esque appeal.When did jazz become a dirty word?
5,A stunning debut,"A musically satisfying debut album - excellent vocal delivery, and even finer piano-playing, with sterling backup and very well-recorded. Highly recommended."
4,"Forget the voice, listen to the piano","I bought this cd because of the many great things I had heard about peter cincotti. He sings very much like Harry Conick Jr (excuse the spelling). Needless to say, I am not a big fan of his delivery. However, peter cincotti is incredibly talented when it comes to playing the piano. If I could mix the album without his singing, this would be an awesome ""sunday brunch"" cd. He does have a lot of talent so I'm sure he will get better at the singing thing. Good cd if you want to listen to a new artist."
2,Say What?,"Absolutely destroys every tune here. We were cringing and laughing at the same time when we heard this stuff. He should consider a career as an actor or model. Reminds me of a young Steve Tyrell only worse. The death blow for us was his hack at ""Miss Brown"". For reference, compare it to 1930's recordings of Billie Holiday doing ""Miss Brown"" available here on Amazon. The playing was far better on the old recordings too. Even early Chet Baker vocals were far better. More marketing than content which is typical of the current industry."
2,Wanted: Vocal Coach,"I happily did not have to pay for Mr. Cincotti's CD but I did listen to all of it. Anyone who mentions him in the same breath as Sinatra needs therapy. His singing is weak and uninspired. He fares better as a pianist but there are DOZENS of pianists in NYC, many working in cabaret, who are better. They are not 19-year-olds whose looks make the girls get all gooey, they are MUSICIANS who do not have the benefit of major-label hype behind them. This CD is a step up from a joke. Get a grip, girls, and check out Bobby Darin's ""THAT'S ALL"" CD if you want to hear brilliant young talent. Then move on to Sinatra and Johnny Hartman when you grow up."
3,one of the up and coming,"As it stands today we have 3 young and good torch carriers of this wonderful music. Each one is good in his own right. Peter for his wonderful piano playing and fresh take on these songs, Michael Buble for his awe inspiring voice and showmanship, and cute little Jamie Cullum for his new wave approach. I enjoy all three, one more than the others, but non the less they are all talended. They are the three names to watch, beware of others who profess to be one of them (brian evans) for they are not the real thing. These three will stand the test of time and will be around for a long time, some forever!!!!"
3,You'll like it by the second listen.,"Bottom line: the more I listen to this CD, the more I like it; it grows on me. I don't sense any Sinatra in Cincotti. I agree that his singing style is similar to that of Harry Connick Jr. On my first listen, I thought his singing was so different that he could be a very talented amateur. But, by the second listen, I had to revise my thinking; he's a young professional with much room for growth and a ""different"" singing voice and style. If you like Diana Krall, Nora Jones, Harry Connick Jr., and that genre of singers and song choices (as I do), then I believe the odds are at least 2-1 that you will like Cincotti by the second listen. I give the CD 3 stars, which to me means that it's good. I reserve 4-5 stars for the very good and excellent. I expect he'll reach that level very soon."
3,Will Cincotti make it?,"I heard that Cincotti is a genius or something. His bio is pretty impressive. I do think he is very talented for his age, but will he really make it? It's really hard to tell from this debut album. Cincotti has a pleasant voice, but he needs some serious singing training to be a real singer. And dangerously shown in this album, he's already developed this irratating pattern of phrasing when he sings. There is a feeling of sameness in all the songs.Overall, my impression is that Cincotti does have talent, he can score 7,8 on everthing from singing, piano playing, composing etc, but there is no one thing that's really spectacular and grabs you."
2,Not quite there~,"Peter Cincotti's songs seem rough around the edges. I've just recently heard Michael Buble and can say that this 25 year old is a modern day Frank. Peter Cincotti doesn't have the smoothness that Michael and the legends have. Though Peter's songs are still entertaining to a certain degree, I would try the other albums first. (Listen to the clips and you'll hear what I'm talking about)"
3,Absolute beginner,"Let me tell you. This is quite a good jazz album. I like Peter voice and, considering his young age, he will have lots to say in the close future, probably...I prefer Jamie Cullum for the way he ""sings"" some old songs and the way he is, but this guy (Peter) must be encouraged because he attempted to write some new jazz stuffs (4 of them in this album) and the sound is good!!! Melodies are fine (the eatles songis great).Well done Peter!Enrico"
3,not for dancers,"I picked this disc based on the Amazon review and customer reviews, for my collection of music to dance to. As such, it was a disappointment. Mr. Cincotti has a pleasant, if unseasoned, voice but otherwise does not bring much to the songs. My favorite track was the instrumental ""Spinning Wheel."" The arrangements are not quite jazz, not quite pop; they would have been stronger if less vague. Should Mr. Cincotti wish to delve deeper into classic pop (aka ""standards""), I recommend some ballroom classes to get a better sense of proper tempo. ""Sway"" attempted a rumba; Dean Martin knocked that one out of the park and Mr. Cincotti hasn't caught it yet. ""Rainbow Connection"" was the track I expected to love, but I'd rather hear Kermit's version. This one is neither a waltz nor a foxtrot, and let's face it: the lyrics don't stand up to just listening. I will keep an eye on future efforts."
1,I'm Missing It,"I'm sorry, but I am missing the hype. I bought this CD on a whim because it was deeply discounted. Nabbed. This guy has an ordinary voice, no charm, uniqueness, depth. It's just flat, blah sounds. Listen to this CD and I think you'll agree that it sounds like he's reading the words. No interpretation, no style, no character. I was sadly disappointed. I was so disappointed that I was compelled to write this. I've never written one but read others often. Buyer beware. I don't understand why I don't hear what the others think they do."
2,Slightly Overrated,"Sorry, but this kid is the product of a great Marketing Agent. He's getting more publicity than he should. He's a very good piano player but his voice is not nearly as good and should not be mentioned in the same breath as Sinatra.I strongly suggest that one can find a better alternative in the music of Michael Buble'. You won't be dissapointed, as Buble' has a much richer sounding voice and can carry a much better note. If we are going to prematurely compare some of the new young singers to some of the old great ones (i.e., Sinatra) then in my opinion, Buble's voice is slightly reminiscent of Mel Torme (no, I'm not saying he's the new Mel Torme). That's how good he is. Go ahead, listen for yourself! This is just my opinion - I'm NOT a music expert."
3,Nice Start,I enjoyed the music so much that I wanted Cincotti to play more and sing less. Great musical ability but so-so vocal ability.
5,Very Nice!,This kid has talent galore. I thought I would be listening to another Jane Monheit or Diana Krall. Nope. This guy is the real thing. A true jazz musician whose piano playing is better than his singing. His best songs are originals. I hope his future goes in the direction of original standards with a more explored piano improv.I would expect his live performances to be even better than his recording.
3,Needs more practice,"The main criticism of Peter Cincotti is that the album is overproduced and that Peter lacks some talent.Cincotti does bang out a dang good version of ""Sway"" which has been the mainstay of the night club acts. There is a great show of him online somewhere where he sings the song and plays the piano very nicely. However, the rest of the album is not good. I recommend the one song alone. Sorry.Peter's voice just hasn't developed and does not sound professional. Michael Buble, and Matt Dusk are demonstrating far more talent at this point in this genre. Their voices are just so much more full than Peter.But don't give up on the guy. He is trying hard and might come back better next round. He just needs some voice lessons or something. He might need better songs too."
5,Truely Amazing,"In listening to this CD, I found Peter to be very VERY impressive. In being a music major myself I can see that he has worked very hard and achieved a lot in his playing and is one that is worth listening to. Obviously he knows the history of his music and players and does well in working their styles into his playing. What also impressed me was that he composed some of these pieces. This is truely AMAZING for such a young man of his age to achieve such a talent. I am sure that this recording will reach out to people and open their minds to what other young musicians are doing besides singing pop or rap. Five Stars and a great job to Peter!"
4,Wonderful Debut CD,"Peter Cincotti is a young Sinatra. His 19 year old voice has the same street wise intensity that made Sinatra so strong for so long. I predict great things for Cincotti.The selection of songs on the CD is great with a mix of old and new. ""Sway"" is by far my favorite of the new material. I thought the inclusion of old pop/rock favorites allowed Cincotti to show his range. The Beatles ""Fool on a Hill"" and Blood Sweat and Tears ""Spinning Wheel"" make the CD easy to listen to with old favorites that remind you that life is worth living still.A wonderful CD that is a welcome break from the digitized trash so much a part of todays music scene."
3,A Good Pianist,"I first saw Peter Cincotti's CD in Walmart while I was browsing. I listened to a sample and was impressed by the piano chops, strangely almost all of the sample tracks in Walmart featured very little vocals. I decided to give him a try and after listening to the CD several times I've decided he's in a similar class with Steve Tyrell. His arrangements are very traditional and he doesn't really have a unique sound. I don't like his voice either. It has a decent timber but it is weak. There is nothing destinct or original about his singing... it's very plain. If you like jazz piano, you might enjoy listening to this guy play. But if you are looking to listen to an outstanding jazz vocalist/pianist try Jamie Cullum or Harry Connick Jr. They have the chops in both departments."
3,Jazz it up next time....,I found Peter's style and song choices didn't match. He seems to talk his way through most songs and I felt he didn't let himself go. I'm sure he's capable of better.
1,Do not purchase this swing chair,"I purchased this Gamecraft Rubber Bucket Swing Chair in March for a new swingset we purchased for my grandson. After just a few months we can't use it because the seat has ""oxidized"" and it leaves a thick blue powdery residue on clothing and skin. My grandson calls me the ""blue man"" after we tried to swing. My hands were completely colored blue after pushing him for 10 minutes."
4,great seat,The seat was a birthday gift from grandparents. This is durable and easy to use. My three year old loves it!
1,Covering up the whitewash,"A fine example of propaganda designed to pacify the duped american population and deflect the real hardcore questions regarding the lies behind what really happened on 9-11 and who was really behind it.Too many people are waking up and not buying the ""official"" nonsense story hence books like this one meant to superficially deflect questions and critiscism that the ""commission"" whitewashed or ommitted.Nice try guys but it's not working."
3,"Should add to title ""And Owners who did a lot of work themselves""","Lovely book, love the idea, got some great ideas for my remodel. However, the author makes clear that one of the most cost-savings measures the owners took, house after house, was to do the work, or some of it, themselves. That's great, if you already work with concrete or metal or can use autoCAD, but for the rest of us, it makes some of the ideas as expensive as before. In addition, the author relied on pictures in the book, which is always great, but the text didn't really cover all of the cost-savings ideas seen in the pictures. Going through the book, I kept wanting more and more detail.Also, the plywood, IKEA cabinets and concrete are used over and over. Now, I love and plan to use all three, but it's not like the author shows us new ideas with each house."
3,glad I bought a cheap used copy,"Nice photographs, and a few good ideas, but no how-to, and it's a book designed to push modern architecture and architects. I suppose it's a good picture book for those who like modern, so I gave it 3 stars, but I'm more of an Arts-and-Crafts era person, and it just wasn't what I was expecting. This one won't be a ""keeper."""
3,Good but not great,Great book with pictures....some great ideas. Would have been more beneficial had they included floor plans so you could see the organization of these spaces and how they interacted with the pictures shown. It will be a book I keep...and I was glad I purchased it used.
2,"Not Cheap, Debatably Good","The function of this book, like so many womens' magazines, is to provide a setting in which we are to imagine a better version of ourselves; fetishizing design in place of practical solutions. Nearly every house featured in this book would command $500,000 in an average market. The reader is supposed to detect without disappointment that ""cheap"" describes one or two details in a house far out of reach for the average person. Obolensky ignores that the overall price of a given house is determined largely by location, square footage, the quantity and quality of labor. If one were truly interested in the cheap, good house they would likely build a small house in a rural county built by unsophisticated locals. This scenario doesn't make for a very sexy book, but it does more realistically meet with home owners' expectations than Good House Cheap House."
3,The book was o.k..,"A boy named Reeve, his nickname is Junebug, wishes that his mother, sister and him, could move out of the projects. He launches his glass collection with notes telling his dreams and wishes. His wish came true, they moved into a house out of the projects."
5,What a Wonderful Story!,"Whoever heard of a child praying, ""Lord, drench us in humility""?! Oswald Chambers - by any standard - was an unusual person who had the courage of his convictions, and who did not mind being a sore thumb! For Christians and would-be Christians who have difficulty being faithful to the cause of Christ, I highly recommend this book! It is so very inspiring."
4,Excellent stories by beloved Author,"Great stories based on experiences of author, and on traditional stories from around Buddhist Asia. Timeless lessons, though sometimes hidden deep in the story. Helpful notes about each story can be found at the end of the book."
5,Zen stories,Anything written by this gentleman is useful and instructive for Western readers. This is a series of short stories by a wonderful man who was nominated for the Nobel Prize by Martin Luther King Jr. The stories are wonderful and have short notes in the back that are references to give the reader information on the inspiration for the subjects. What a truly great read by my favorite unassuming Buddhist writer!
2,Average,This DVD while it tries to be thorough never really hits it's stride as a proper instructional tool. I would suggest that those who are just starting out in either Photoshop and Illustrator avoid this product. There are a few technical glitches in which the instruction recording is stopped and then restarted several steps further down the line and if you're unfamiliar with the software being used you really will be lost.
1,"As smart as ""W""","This book tries to belittle and skew what being a liberal means, but if being a liberal means being honest, intelligent, and thoughtful, everything that Bush is not, count me in."
3,Overall - pretty good - funny,I was not sure what to expect on this one. I don't agree completely on the Libertarian viewpoint but it was funny and pulls-no-punches on what is wrong in this PC-nonsense world we live in.I think there are better books out there - but this was entertaining.I gave this to a liberal friend of mine to read.I wonder if I will get it back?Art
3,Surprisingly good--3 1/2 stars....,"This book was given to me and almost got sent to the thrift store. I've never watched much South Park and I'm kinda tired of political books. However, just before getting rid of the book, I took a look at the chapter on South Park and got hooked. I had no idea the South Park episodes were full of so much political satire. It always seemed to be a show that made fun of everything, but as this book pointed out--their biggest target is the left-wing. This book is about more than just South Park--other highlights are the chapter on the right-wing blogosphere and conservative comedy."
2,Underwhelmed,"From Chapter 7, I present this excerpt:""There is nothing like a book,"" social thinker Michael Novak rightly notes. ""Held in hand. Underlined. Kept on a shelf nearby. Remembered for years. People expect to be moved by books, to learn, to be changed.""South Park Conservatives did no such thing. What I thought would be a book about an interesting topic and demographic, was nothing more than a shallow explanation that, indeed, many people in this country choose to enjoy conservative media outlets. From picking off some poll results, using a lot of quotes, and a lot of anecdotal evidence, this book is very much lacking in substance.If you disagree or agree with the premise of the book from the outset, you will be unswayed. If you are a critical thinker, you'll simply be underwhelmed."
1,Give me a break,"This book is truly awful. How can an author have any credibility when his ""objective sources"" include Ann Coulter, David Horowitz, Brent Bozell,and Stephen Hayes? What a revelation, Brian, that far-right wingers think the media is liberal! Wow, you don't say! I guess the author inhabits some sort of fantasy land where FOX News is ""fair and balanced."" I've watched FOX for years, and it has a rightward slant; anyone with an objective point of view can see that. Even the right-wing New American magazine has called Fox ""a subsidiary of the Republican Party.""I could go on and on detailing the author's false statements- no there were no WMDs found in Iraq; Saddam was not behind 9-11 or assisting Al-Qaeda; the charges of the Swift Boat Veterans were contradicted by soldiers who were actually there, but that would be redundant. Don't believe a word of this book. For all you reviewers who liked this book, I have a question: Are you really that gullible? Try thinking for yourself."
1,Congratulations to South Park,"I'm not going to spend hours filling this space with pretentious garbage, reading and re-reading my review and pretending I'm special because I can read AND write. I have other things to do. I just want to say a heartfelt ""Congrats!"" to the show, ""South Park"" for being so hilariously interpreted in this book. I found Mr Anderson's sad little book very opinionated, and his opinion flat. If you haven't already read this book, don't waste your time. Spend your precious hours watching ""South Park"" instead."
1,"""All Humor Conservative""? HA!","All humor is conservative, and all of my condom loads are ""precious life"". Seriously guys, if conservatives are finally catching up to South Park, then Parker and stone can retire their titles as anti-establishment provacateurs. For all the nihilist posturing these guys do, it's really hilarious that they're being embraced by right-wing tools who will sit idly by while the fringe of their party strives to pass legislation that would not allow South Park to be on the air. What a country.By the way, South Park has been far surpassed by real cutting edge comedy like ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" and ""Wonder Showzen"". You Reaganites can have Dennis Miller and Colin Quinn (good riddance!). We'll take Mr. Show, Bill Hicks, Patton Oswalt, Jon Stewart, Mitch Hedberg, and almost all of the planet's other funniest people."
1,What the Hell Is This Guy Talking About????,"Firstly, South Park makes fun of both liberals and conservatives. They talk common sense and ridicule everyone who tries to make every issue political. Watch the Schiavo episode that shows Republicans using the Devil for their work and how they use religion as a weapon. Hilarious! Most people in this country are moderate and the media tries to show the extremes. We're pro death penalty but pro choice, get over it conservatives! And all the garbage about and WMDs (that were not found)in Iraq. Yes, the media is to blame for it a bit, but these neo-conservatives are more whiney and baby-like than the liberals they're accusing of the very same thing. WHAA WHAA WHAA! Do not buy the lies."
1,Green Tea,"The taste is very poor and the product contains too much sugar, calorie and fat. Sad...wish did not buy this product."
1,Sugary dangerous mix,"Thsi product is just green sugar. Try Maed-en green tea instead and mix ""at will""with soy vanilla sherbet or soy milk."
5,"DVD, The Cartel","This was fantastic. It shows what really goes on in the school system. It pinpoints the corruption with the unions, the administrators and the system in general. This extortion by the Education Unions has got to stop along with the excessive salaries that is paid to administrators on down the line and the excessive school districts the unions have established. This DVD, ""The Cartel"" has to be seen. It is well worth it."
1,Very Poor Propaganda,"The agenda is obvious and anyone that does not see it is part of the education problem. This documentary and associated five star reviews really show the lack of critical thinking in this country and how a serious education problem is sloughed off on so called over paid teachers and staff. Blame yourselves and not the education system if you raised a moron similar to yourself. The lack of responsibility on the part of parents is what is killing us, not decent people trying to make a living. I am not a union member or anything close but I can appreciate that schools do not operate in a vacuum and need infrastructure. Values begin at home and from what I see here, the only values being perpetuated are that of money and materialism. Shameful."
5,A must see,"An honest and balanced video. If you had any question about the harm the teacher union is doing to the children ofthis country, you will not after The Cartel. This should be shown in every school in the country."
2,Doesn't Address the Root of the Problem,"As a public school teacher, in a Southern rural school district, I do not have to deal with the issues facing large urban school districts like the ones in New Jersey. But I am angered by the overall attitude of this movie that the problem with education today are the people running our education system. Yes, there are things we need to improve. No doubt about it. But on the other hand, when are the students and parents going to be held accountable for what happens in the schools? There are three vital links to a quality education: highly trained and motivated teachers, involved parents and engaged students. When one of these pieces is missing, chances are a child's education is going to be sacrificed. To continually beat up teachers and unions is not only unfair, but counter productive and inflammatory."
1,"Started out good, but quickly revealed the real agenda.","It only took about 40 minutes for to unveil what the real agenda of this documentary seems to be: Union busting. Early on it is demonstrated that only 10% of the education budget goes to teacher salary and that New Jersey has hundreds of excess administrative position, which ear hundreds of thousands per year. They also talk about custodians who make over $100,000 per year. However, these problems are soon forgotten when they proceed to blame all the education problems on the teacher's union."
3,Red or Blue...,"This is a documentary about an issue which does get people pumped up and feel that there is a divide when it comes to pay and results... Even governors express their frustration in this documentary. What is amazing is that no one talks about the cause but they are all willing to talk about the symptoms. We all know that the system is corrupt but regardless of the crime why is not there a solution... I am not a teacher and do not belong to any union and although this documentary was entertaining to watch the question is why are not the politicians finding solution instead of pointing fingers at the teachers, unions and others... Infact why did not they questions politicians in this documentary instead of pointing fingers at teachers and unions..."
5,Scariest film I've seen in a long time,"I second the opinions of previous reviewers that this is a film every taxpayer should see and then share with as large an audience as possible. It details in a clear and unmistakable fashion exactly what is at the root of our nation's problem with education. As one inner city mother in the film said, ""(The school system) has been pimpin' our kids for a long time"". This film is not anti-teacher, anti-principal, or anti-public-funding. It is simply an explanation of how teachers unions buy political influence, defraud taxpayers and continually pilfer billions of dollars, most of which never make it into classrooms, then hold prisoner the children (particularly in the poorest districts) most in need of resources. I came away from this film outraged."
3,Proselytizing for Charter Schools,"This documentary presents itself as fair and balanced, but in the end simply cheer leads for charter schools. Here in the Northwest, Bellevue, WA has stellar public schools with many in the list of the top in the nation. Suburban public school systems often teach for half the price per pupil of urban schools and produce scholars. The problem is not schools, the problem is urban density. Clear strong, but low cost neighborhoods, can be free of corruption and deliver education as good or better than the most elite private school. Charter schools only introduce a redundant and rickety infrastructure that is not needed."
5,OUTSTANDING!,"This CD has set the world for the Star Trek sound! Jerry Goldsmith definitely knew what he was doing! The only downside to this CD, is that inside Star Trek CD. This CD is worth the money!"
3,Great album -- not the Holographic Slipcase edition,"I ordered this item from Amazon and the tracks are great. However, the CD I was sent does not have the holographic slipcase, but the regular cover with graphics from the movie. If you want the holographic case, order from another source!"
3,Not as good as I had hoped.,Believe it or not I am new to the Star trek world. I got this one and some other ST movies. I knew about the characters due to the pop culture effect it has had on society. But it took to long to get started and was slow and boring in several parts.
5,Great Read,"Just loved the book, McGarrity is a great writer, very captivating and he describes New Mexico in such an excellent way, you truly picture the places that are very familiar to me."
3,Not as Good,"Definitely not as good as the earlier books in this series. Kerney does not seem like himself. Way too much time spent on Sara's story in Ireland. I thought maybe it would all somehow tie together, but it does not. If Kerney is retiring and Sara stays in Iraq a while, what can McGarrity write about after this? Who knows, but in the next novel, Clayton (the earlier son) is supposed to be a big part. Read it if you just want to keep up with the series."
3,Too much filler,"This is one of the weaker Kevin Kearney novels. Lots of detail on geographic places, in New Mexico and Ireland, and way too much stuff on movie making. Also, the ending is not satisfying, the reader does not know if Sara in Iraq even knows that her work in Ireland paid off. Hope the next one is better."
2,Not McGarrity's best,"Mr. McGarrity seemed to have trouble focusing on a storyline in Nothing But Trouble. None of the plots were fully developed, and too many questions remained dangling at the end of the book. I have enjoyed all the other Kevin Kerney novels, but this one disappointed me."
2,Kerney Come back to New Mexico,"I've enjoyed the Kerney series; in fact one of my favorites that I couldn't wait for the next one to be released. No more. I will now wait for the paperback. If I wanted to read a mystery set in Ireland, I would look for an Irish author. There is very little action in the book. The characters are not well developed. I'm simply not interested in Sara Brannon and her military misadventures.I don't know why successful authors think they have to experiment and move away from a successful product. McGarrity needs to refocus on Kerney and New Mexico. Otherwise, he is going to have ""nothing but trouble."""
5,Eco Friendly AND washes better than any other!,"We moved into a home with a septic system and I wanted products that protected our system and were environmentally friendly. I came across these tablets on Amazon some time ago and after reading the reviews I decided to give them a try. I must admit, this stuff work better than any other dish washing detergent or tablets I've ever tried. My dishes come out squeaky clean, every time. It's amazing! Not only that, but there is something to be said about a genuinely ""clean"" dish. No phosphates, totally biodegradable, safe for aquatics and works 100%. Now that's a good product."
5,Love it!,"We were skeptical at first---an earth-friendly dishwasher detergent? Our doubts vanquished with the first wash. We put it to the test with dried on cheese and eggs and glass glasses. Not only did it clean the dishes, it did it without scratching! The best part is that there is no mess. The premeasured tablets are easy for my husband to use, without sight. No more finger dipping to feel how much he put in the cup. No more white drips to clean up or pants spoiled by bleach! Clean and green!"
2,Leaves a Film,"This works well on glass and utensils, but all of my plastic storage containers had a thick, white film on them that was difficult to rub off. I'm not going to use this anymore because I use a lot of storage containers and am not willing to scrub off the film. If you don't use plasticware, this is a good choice."
1,What is with the price increase???,"I purchased the Ecover Dishwashing Tablets last June and fell in love with them. I ordered the multipack of 5 boxes for exactly $22.08. I went to reorder them today and had a nasty revelation... the price has skyrocketed to $69.99. Are you kidding me??? I read through the other reviews and no one seemed to have a problem paying this much, but I can't for the life of me understand a jump in price that severe. What gives, Amazon? I can understand a few dollars... the cost of inflation, etc. But to go from $22.08 to $69.99 is really absurd. I will be finding another brand of ecofriendly dishwashing detergent that doesn't cost it's weight in gold."
5,So far so good,So far this is the best detergent we've found. I was using the powder before I started using their tablets. We don't have any complaints about this product
5,Clean AND safe!,"After reading so much about how dishwashing soaps contain some of the nastiest chemicals that leave an invisible residue on your dishes, I wanted to find something that would be safe to use on the dishes that we eat off of every single day. I have not been disappointed with these dishwashing tablets!! They do just as good of a job as Electasol tablets and Dawn gel packs (what we were using previously). My dishes come out perfect, but if they aren't shiny enough for you, you could always add vinegar to the rinse aid dispenser. The smell of this soap is not overpowering, just a gentle clean smell. And I don't have to worry about my kids ingesting the nasty chemicals that other dishwashing soaps leave on dishes!"
1,Misses the mark by some way!,"The title implies its for advanced ASP developers or aimed at creating advanced applications / sites.Sadly the book misses the mark and ends up being in 'no mans land' by sitting in a grey area which neither assists inexperienced developers or satifies and pushes more advanced coders.Having varying authors to contribute sepereate chapters leaves the book with a lack of cohesion due to the differing writing styles. The content, and the way it is presented, leaves a lot to be desired.To conclude the book promissed to be a sound addition to a developers library but ends up being a rather expensive coaster to put you coffee cup on while you're sweating over your code.Avoid at all costs!"
5,A Virtual History Vacation,"This book is a gem! Besides the fact that Bisbee is one of my favorite places to visit, the author makes the trip there so enjoyable, you have a hard time remembering you've been there already. I especially liked the story of the Christmas 'Tree' he brought in one year for Christmas. Get this book and take it to a quiet corner to read. You will be transported."
5,Living in Arizona,"Richard Shelton delivers an accurate, sublime view of what is like to live in the Sonoran Desert. As an old desert rat myself, I found myself in almost full agreement while chuckling with pleasure. It is a great read."
4,Going Back to Bisbee -- for sure!,"Going Back to Bisbee was written in 1992, but it is very current and a fascinating read.Especially for people who live in or love southern Arizona. I'm going back to Bisbeeagain 'for sure' now that I've read this book!"
4,Directions Please???,"I bought this because my renters tore the old one out of my rental house. The Lazy Susan worked, but I couldn't figure out how to put it in and figured a new one would have directions.If you attach it to a board, then the board covers up the holes so you can't attach in the other direction.It didn't, and the contractor didn't know either. The guy at Lowe's said I had to have the entire cabinet remade.Now I know. You have to attach it to a long board, the width of the bearings. Then you can drive two alternating screws into the base, rotate it 90 degrees, and drive in the the last two screws.Now you need to attach the long board to the to upper board.Anyway, it is very, very well made and sturdy once you get it in. Despite my renters totally trashing my house and this being in their line of fire, they were unable to actually break it, they just ripped it out of the cabinet. That says a lot."
5,Excited to use it.,I purchased these to use on a project I am building for a Christmas gift. They look like they will be perfect for my project.
5,Lazy Susan Bearings,I am a sewing crafty person I used these bearings to make Thread holders for my embroidery thread and am in the process of buying more. They are great for lots of other uses. Thanks Amazon.com
5,Amazing,"I bought both a 3 inch and 4 inch lazy susans. Both are absolutely amazing, very sturdy construction, very little lateral play. Smooth operation and its unreal that they will support 200 and 300 pound capacities respectively. Just amazing."
5,modern handloading.,if you are like me you do not have just 1 or 2 or even 3 reloading books. the more the better. this gives alot of data for modern loads. gives alot of good information. would be a good to have in the library
4,The Oxter English Dictionary,"A valuable addition to my home reference library, with an abundance of unusual words set in context through examples of usage by outstanding writers."
2,Nice but expensive,"This is a nice book because explains clearly, but it does not cover new developments and it is expensive, like many other Wiley classics."
4,Excellent comeback album by Paul Collins Beat,"Paul Collins' Beat have taken a strange approach to the typical comeback album. They released 2 albums at the same time, the studio album ""Flying High"" and the live album ""Live In Europe."" ""Live In Europe"" features new guitar-crunching versions of the well-known songs from the early albums by The Beat. ""Flying High"" is the new studio album, with 1/2 the songs recorded acoustic and semi-acoustic and the other 1/2 as a full band with electric guitars. If you're a fan of Bob Dylan, The Beatles, The Jayhawks or even The Byrds, this new studio album is for you. If you're a fan of rock bands such as The Ramones, The Rolling Stones or AC/DC, I recommend getting ""Live In Europe."""
1,Piece of Junk,"After about a week of using this computer the entire system lost power. It did it again after two months (two day ago) several times in a row. HP tech support states that I am using too much RAM and this is normal. That is a bunch of bull. Using too much RAM should require your computer to access the hard drive and run slow, not lose power and shutdown. Today the adapter has failed and they stated that they would call me back in a few days. Don't buy this computer. In fact stay away from HP."
2,HYPER-SNAIL,"I have owned it for a week and it's slower then my old P2 400mhz desktop,I was led to believe it has the 3.00ghz hyper-threading P4 but you dont mention it above??, the touchpad is impossible to control and the buttons are poorly positioned to click, I keep hunting above and below the dang thing, I have tried all the settings and reloaded the drivers but it quickly goes back to slow and erratic, its going back to not-so best buy for my ... refund what a rip for a piece of junk.P.S. my old system is an HP Pavilion 7160Z that i changed boards to msi-6163 so I am very familiar with HP after 5yrs with one, should have learned the first time and built my own"
3,Promising but....,"The story was very interesting at first.Its a great concept but towards the end of the book ,it started to drag. I skimmed the pages of the last chapter to get to the end. It is a wonderful story though."
2,It says FOR ANY LEVEL....,"I was very excited to get my DVD..being a semi beginner I thought the 21 days would build on each other. It is advertised FOR ANY LEVEL..I didn't feel that. There was NO introduction..no practice poses..the first DVD was 45 mins long.. There were advanced poses. She spoke too quickly and mumbled..The first DVD went right Into a routine..with no practice..no intro. It was very frustrating. There wasn't a woman next to her doing it for beginners as a comparison that a lot of fitness DVD's have . I felt I needed to keep up ..45 mins..your first time ..yikes! I know I will,probably ""grow into it"" but felt the ""for any level"" was misleading."
3,"quite outdated now, but still has enough useful stuff","It was written rather more targeting the fixed-pipeline/rudimentary programmable shaders era. It's too bad it wasn't released a year or two later. That said, it is fairly well written and still has useful information relevant today, if occasionally a little sparse on the more advanced and fully relevant stuff (and I would say this book, plus the free online OpenGL 3.3 documentation plus an introduction to initiating the modern API, ""Beginning OpenGL Game Programming - 2nd ed"" make a much better set than getting the poor ""OpenGL Programming Guide - 7th ed""; add ""OpenGL Shading Language - 3rd ed"" to these and and you are set)."
2,I love the idea,"I love the idea, but it falls short. My kids were bored by the whole book. Sadly. I really was hoping that it could be done. But if you want to tie your beliefs into the kids education the teach it separate from math. this book does not work. From a homeschooling Mom of eight."
5,Great Insight!,I think this book hits the nail right on the head. Dr. Clarke captures the essence of what so many fail to do and yet he does it with such insight and remarkable understanding from every conceivable angle. Highly recommended reading!
1,Hardly worth the paper it's printed on,"Kind of a pre-teen trashy romance. Come on...the title ""Boy Talk"" speaks for itself. Also stupid is how Alison is painted as this all-evil villian and Crystal is a all-good ""pure"" girl who flatters Evan to get him to ask her out. Does Crystal think to ask Evan out? NOOOO! She hangs around playing games hoping to ""make"" Evan notice her. Get real lives, Florida beach Boy Talk Air Bubbles!"
1,Grace?,"I know this man, and if he's ""found grace,"" I wager she's 13 years old!I wrote a review of this book a year or so ago and it's been removed. I find that interesting seeing as how other, older reviews are still posted.I knew this man back when he was actively flashing young children on school buses, and, personally, it's my understanding those kinds of perverts never really stop their favorite activity.He is a liar, a flim-flam artist, a con artist, a thief and a pervert. If you wrote a good review, you got suckered! That goes for anyone who would publish this book, much of which is not true, and I know that from personal experience. And it should go as no surprise that ""Parker"" is not the name he was born with. I thought that it was against the law to change your name to hide a criminal past, but he got away with it just the same."
1,Former 'patient' of Jay's and I KNEW I wasn't crazy,"Sheesh, where would I ever begin. I was delighted to read the book and most especially the reviews to realize and come to terms with the fact that it wasn't just me who thought Jay was a quack. I knew something wasn't quite right, starting with his credentials and growing exponentially from there. I never felt comfortable with his pseudo-psych rap. It was especially frightening to read from his 'publisher' about how Jay was in such denial until so very recently (and during the time I was seeing him). Funny how Jay never mentioned that part of his story to any of us nor the fact that he was writing a book.I could go on and on but I'm glad the truth is getting out there and that I don't feel so much like I was crazy anymore."
4,Great followup!,"The explosive Sights follow their brilliant Who ""Sell Out""-style hodge podge debut ""Are You Green"" by more tightly compacting their influences. More consistently bluesy and (pardon the expression) cock rocky, the group still weaves in Mersey bits, Badfinger, Blue Cheer, Bad Company, and at one point a simple and blazing if shameless Zep riff. Baranek has dead-on, archetypal rock vocals, though subtle variations at times recall Elton John, among others. ""Got What I Want"" sounds like a cover of the Spinal Tap classic played by early Guns and Roses. Think of great rock bands when they played 200 capacity bars. See them now in such a venue."
4,Annoyingly catchy,"Sounds like The Rutles to me. The band name does them no favours as you assume they're another 'The...'-type Detroit rock band. Clever US Pop/Rock pfuzz in the glorious tradition of Red Kross, the 1st Christmas LP or Game Theory (when they weren't being 'experimental')."
2,Not enough meat,"""The only introduction you'll ever need"" if you only need to skim the surface. The book is very small, and they waste loads of space on the Qabalalistic view of various lifestyle decisions and situations, all of which to my mind isn't necessary for the ""pathless path"". It's like a reflection, and is different depending on what you bring to it. Explaining such things make it seem as though there is only one answer. By the time they approach actually explaining things, assuming you read through all of that, there isn't enough room to give it any depth. It's TOO simplistic and I would really only recommend it for people who want to know what the Qabalah is, but have no intensions on any serious study."
3,Not too bad but a bit too indepth in some parts...,"This is quite a good introduction to the Qabalah. The problem that I found with it is that it becomes difficult to understand at some points and the authoress goes into too much detail with aspects such as symbolism in the tarot. I found the book to be good overall, although she explained some points with monotonous language and she seemed to ramble on and repeat points which were made clear the first time. As an introduction, it is a fairly good little reference point."
2,Pink Marshmallow New Age Fluff,"Some people who want an introduction might like this book, but it had way too much new age fluff for me. If you're looking for a deeper introduction to the qabalah, you should probably look elsewhere."
3,OK,Does not have the power I expected but is fine for light to medium work. It looks nice and operates fine but is a little short in the guts department. For the price it works alright.
5,Typical DIYer,I am the family handyman and enjoy working with my hands.I take a lot of pride in being able to help family and friends with projects and repairs that need to be done. I also take pride in doing it the right way instead of quick fixes that bite you in the behind later. It takes proper tool to accomplish that. I shop carefully for tools in order to get as many quality tools that i can for the budget that i have. This one fits the bill. It is a good all around impact for the home owner with mechanical hobbies. It should last forever. I would reccomend it to everyone.
1,So bad it's good,"This book is horrible. The descriptions are incoherent and nonsensical, much of the plot is not explained and quite a bit of it makes absolutely no sense. The good part of that, though, is that this book is SO bad it actually ends up being funny! If you actually want a good fantasy book, don't bother with this. Seriously, you'll regret it. If you just want something awful to laugh at, though, then this is the book for you!"
1,I could not believe my eyes,"I just read two pages and my brain has broken.I've read worse fanfiction, but someone paid the author for this drivel? It's worse than Gor. It's worse than Naked Came The Stranger. It's worse than...well, I hope you get the picture. My guess is that Arthur Clarke was having a bad day or they left out the part of the quote that said the author was unfairly advantaged in that he couldn't write if his life depended upon it. ""Her pubes was..."" is only the start of the horrid grammar lapses. Who proofread this piece of drek?The descriptions he overuses make absolutely zero sense, as well. Anyone picking this book up deserves what they get.Did I mention this book is really awful?"
1,This doesn't get even one star from me. But unfortunately it's required.,"I read only six pages of this, and I was completely turned off. The description of Bronwyn during the ""seduction"" scene was so, so, so horrible that I gagged at the end of it. But it goes on! And on. And oooon. It is utterly ridiculous and should be read only for big honking incredulous laughs."
5,Great reliable amplifier,"I had this amp for six years and someone had it before me and it never stopped working and ran two 10"" subs great!"
3,Trouble with holding the setting for bevel cuts,Had no troubles until I tried to do a 20 degree bevel cut. setting it was easy but when you go to make the cut is slipped to 30 degress. found it completely useless for bevel cuts other than the 45 degree bevel setting.
2,"Save your money, buy a Bosch","I'm on my third blade retention clamp now. Dewalt Customer service was no help; the local Dewalt Authorized Repair center told me I should have bought a Bosch!!! I'll never own another ""tool-less"" blade holder type again!"
5,very well made,"you just can't go wrong with Dewalt, rock solid construction design that just feel like a contractor tool.i ""try"" to make everyrthing dewalt, but just cant' afford to have every dewalt in my tool shop, but this one is definite worth the money."
1,Another one with blade retention issues,"I bought a 331 a couple weeks ago and it worked great for awhile until it started spitting blades while cutting laminate flooring. No matter how I re-installed the blade they still came out. I exchanged it for another 331 thinking it was a defective unit and didn't get 1/4 of an inch cut using the new one and it too spit the blade.I couldn't believe I was so ""stupid"" that I couldn't install the blades properly so I called Lowes and the local DeWalt repair center and neither had an answer to the problem. I was using DeWalt blades and tried B+D blades as well with the same result.It seems no matter how deeply you seat the blade it will pop out even cutting something as low stress as laminate flooring.I am no dummy and have worked with power tools my entire life as well as having a mechanical engineering background. Looks like the second unit gets returned and I'll have to switch tool colors."
4,Do you like stupid funny comedy?,"If you said yes to the question above then this cd is good for you, infact if your like me you might be obsessed with it, hope you like it. I think you will."
5,heheh I love this album,"I love come sail away by cartman it was so cute, and bubblegoose THAT WAS TOOO CUTE! I was singing along the whole album"
4,This Album is a Keeper,"It is so refreshing to get a n album that gets the humor of South Park. I bought it for 'Chocolate Salty Balls,' but was pleasantly suprised by the rest fo the album. This is a 'Must Have'."
2,Silly piece of fun.,I think that this terrible music should not reach no 1 in the charts . I have decided to join a band and reach No1 myself. Although i am a great fan of South Park this is an insult to music.
2,2 stars for two good tunes!!,i got it used around the time it came out just for two tunes... joe strummer's it's a rockin' world (for those of you out there that don't know joe was in the legendary and greatest punk band ever...the clash) and rancid's brad logan (brad logan is the singer for the cali. hardcore band on hellcat called f-minus...some real music there kiddies!)i have the edited version but that doesn't matter cause i could care less for the other songs that would be edited anyways!
3,I only bought it for the Rancid track.,"I only really picked this cd up because it was cheap and had rancid on it and glad i only payed a few bucks for it.Its made as a Live show in south park with chef being the Host.I only really like 3 of the tracks on here Rancids brad logan,Mase/puffy/lil kim and SOAD and Ozzy.ODB and DMX.The rest of the tracks are just random artists (Master P,Elton john,meat loaf,joe strummer and a few other celebrities) probably only worth buying if you are a big south park fan or if you have spare change."
4,Excellent for strengthening all your fingers,"The exercises in Hanon's book are specifically designed to strengthen all of your fingers. Practicing them is not difficult, it just takes a bit of time each day. After 1 week of practice, I could already feel the difference. Keep at it, and you will notice an amazing improvement in your piano playing ability. Best wishes."
4,An Oldie but a Goodie,I've gotten about halfway through and while the exercises are a bit boring I think they will help develop finger strength in the long run. I also want to get a book of scales/arpeggios that would be a little less mechanical.
3,A Cut-Rate Dirty Harry meets The Grudge,"My rating of three stars places this film in the spectrum of indie suspense/thrillers. It falls in the middle of that limited range. If all films were considered, this one would hardly make that high a grade.A lot of this low budget indie film comes off as episodic and amateurish. Some of the scenes involving minor characters look like a videotaped version of a college drama class rehearsal. What's more, the plot is an uneasy mix of the supernatural Grudge and a British Dirty Harry.However the lead actor, Steven Elliott, does a good job with the material he's given. I found myself more absorbed whenever he was on-screen, which is much of the time. He has a dark charisma and might be expected to make the crossover to star in polished, professional films in the near future. So you can look for him. And you could do worse than take a look at this film."
1,Lifeless,"Long, drawn out, boring....The whole film including the acting is very, very dull.The nanny was really the only interesting person, and she is only in a few scenes."
2,Fair,Watched the movie tru out. The first hour was a bit boaring and the end was well the father kidnapped his own daughter after he had kidnapped another little girl. He was trying to cover up the first little girls disappearence and murder.Not the best but ok...
3,"Not really that good, all slow arias","As we all know, Sutherland is at her best in fast arias. This cd has all slow arias.Sutherland is best served by the DVD ""The complete Bell Telephone Hour Performances 1961-1968"", and the VHS ""Age of Bel Canto""."
1,This book is trash.,"The time of the hero is a barely comprehensible piece of trash. It's only semi-coherent, and that only sometimes. It's nearly impossible to tell one character from another. The story is pointlessly vile and utterly devoid of any worth. If your teacher has assigned you this book I pity you."
5,Can't Get Better,"Easy access with the top zipper instead of a backpack or duffel bag design, for example. Sufficient compartments with the swimmer's needs in mind."
5,"Healing Childhood Ear Infections: Prevention, Home Care,","This book was just what I was looking for! My son was battling repeated ear infections and I knew there had to be other options than antibiotics and ear tubes. I am so glad I read this before we progressed to surgery. I am now an active homeopathic user, and my son has been earache free for months!I thank the author for presenting all the options available."
2,Plodding self indulgence,This is raw data: the banal musings of day to day living without any insight. Who cares if Hepburn did this or Garbo said that? It is a document of his daily activities with no analysis of the impact that the events depicted had on him as a person or writer. There aren't too many books I don't compulsively finish. This is one of them.
2,Very unsatisfying,"I found this biography very unsatisfying. While it is considered the definitive Edision biography by the pre-eminent Edison scholar of the day, I thought that Edison was strangely absent from its pages. I thought that Israel gave short shrift to Edison the man and his family. Writing style is very dry--no personal details--only the big picture."
4,The best biography of Edison so far,This is the first biography of Edison with real details about how he and his co-workers carried out the process of invention. The best previous Edison biography (Neil Baldwin's Edison: Inventing the Century (1995)) contains many interesting personal anecdotes but lacks the sort of research and development details required by a technically oriented reader. Paul Israel's scholarly work is a much needed addition to the history of technology.
4,A Super Sexy Swingin' Good Time!,"I've never been a big Jess Franco fan, but this movie is a real treat! It's a great time-capsule of sleazy euro-trash at it's sexiest...lots of cool sets, lots of great colors, lots of nudity, lots of ridiculous zoom shots...and whatta soundtrack! I've had the CD soundtrack for a long time and it's one of the best 60's bachelor-pad type scores ever...it's great to finally hear it in the movie! There's hardly any story, but if you like euro-trash, you won't be able to take your eyes off of it! Another great release from Synapse! A#1++++++"
4,A sober Franco film.,"Don't be fooled by the title of the film. This is one of the more mainstream of Jess Franco's film, you could probably show it to your religious grandmother. It's erotic but not in that sleazy perverse way like Ilsa-The Wicked Warden or Female Vampire with one scene as a exception where Jess Franco himself plays a sadist who loves torturing women that he captures. But still it's sexy and elegant much thanks to the two beautiful female leads Soledad Miranda and Ewa Stroemberg. Miranda plays the lesbian vampire seducing Stroemberg. Dennis Price is the doctor who studies vampires cause he wants to be one himself and be immortal. The weird music is also one of the highlights, it gives the film a psychedelic atmosphere. And watch the film with the german dubbing, it makes the film even weirder. I give this film ""just"" 4 stars since it lacks the outrageous perverse atmosphere that many other of Franco's films have. But still it's gold worth and a must in your filmcollection."
2,"Soledad Yes, Franco No","Soledad Miranda, the star of the film, is beautiful, tantalizing and hypnotic to watch, and for about 10% of the film naked, which means 10% of this film is superb. The remainder is an editor's and screenwriter's nightmare. Now there's the european artsy filmaking style and there's just plain inept. This film jumps back and forth between the two. Yes, the psychedelic soundtrack is great -- too bad director Franco could not have put together a coherent fun film that fully exploits Miranda's talent."
1,Vampyros lesbos,"not a vampire or a lesbian film. Funny title.Not. Pitty about the quality, special effects, acting, continuity, camera work. If it wasn't for all these things and more it would still have been a bad film. If you want a film from the 1970's this could be it. If you don't ........well stop reading. I speak both German and English, Not being able to understand German, would make this film less understandable and so more viewable. Hmmm and I actually bought this and waited 4 weeks for it. Well it just goes to show you there really are some stupid people still out there who will buy anything. Signing off with egg on my face."
5,Carefully orchestrated psychedelic imagery.,"This is another cinematic masterpiece by Spanish director Jesús Franco. It's groundbreaking for its time, and the carefully orchestrated psychedelic imagery is very intense.I also recommend She Killed in Ecstasy (a.k.a. Mrs. Hyde).Jesús ""Jess"" Franco (born 12 May 1930 as Jesús Franco Manera) is a Spanish film director, writer, cinematographer and actor. His career took off in 1961 with his cult classic The Awful Dr. Orloff, which received wide distribution in the United States and England."
5,very artistic filmmaking,"i love the symbolism here--everytime nadine wants to make a strike, the camera zooms in on a scorpion walking the premises of her castle. the stripshow performance is also very classy--where the countess much like her actions outside of the club controls the movements of her victims--and switches clothing with them (becomes one with the ones she loves). very tastefully done, and hypnotic to watch-and the two main characters are exquisitely beautiful women--where they complement each other perfectly--the vampire is dark, and her victim white. wonderful."
2,A prime example of how NOT to write a textbook.,"I've had to read through many textbooks in my time. And I can state that this is one of the worst I've ever had the displeasure of reading.Starr and McMillan pack information into dense paragraphs that make the eyes water. Also, they tend to put too many technical terms next to one another, creating a sense of information overload. A better tactic would have been to have spread the terms out a little bit more, even if it meant making the book a bit larger.The diagrams are serviceable, but nowhere near as detailed or informative as others I've seen.In the end, I have to come down hard on this book. Professors and school districts, I beg you not to choose HUMAN BIOLOGY for your courses. And students, if your professors or school districts *do* choose this book, you have my sympathies."
2,Updike Needs a Sabbatical,"To begin with, we should all write as well as Mr. Updike. He is a fine exemplar of the New Yorker tradition in American letters. But he has been at it now for so many years, and it shows. Perhaps he needs a sabbatical so he can come back refreshed. The idea is not so absurd: cartoonists Garry Trudeau (""Doonesbury"") and Gary Larson (""The Far Side"") both took year-long vacations from their work.Updike lacks for neither intelligence nor industry. He dutifully cranks out his essays as if he were making sausage. And therein lies the problem: nothing he writes is terribly interesting, let alone inspired.And let me just say, since other readers have alluded to it, Updike is wrong in his assessment of Tom Wolfe. Updike has his particular genius, Wolfe has his. Wolfe has long since demonstrated his indispensability and durability. Why can't Updike accept that?"
5,His Best Book of Essays Yet,"As varied as HUGGING THE SHORE, but far more eloquent and intorspective. His remarks on Welty are the best I've ever read and he is not afraid to be honest about literure's flavor of the month: Tom Wolfe. (Agree with him or not, he presents a thought provoking argument and isn't that what an essay is for. His comments about Melville add to the previous work, but stand on their own. Updike is a stud!"
4,A Great Sounndtrack.,"I enjoyed most of the songs on here. This album is also well-produced. I think that THIS soundtrack was the original because it's the basis of the whole story. Also, people like CeCe Winans, Kirk Franklin and Trin-i-tee 5:7 should have made videos."
5,The sound track had me almost inside the movie.,"This soundtrack had me almost inside the movie. Let me tell you, I'm 16 years of age and I went to go see the movie, Prince of Egypt. Even though I've read the story and heard it a thousand times, i felt the same sensation, fear, and love as the first time that I read it. Well I just don't recomend it just for little children i recomend it for everyone of all ages. The Prince of Egypt soundtrack puts you right back into that sensation all over again. Charles A."
1,packaging is very misleading,I picked this up in my local library so they didn't actually rip me off. I enjoyed the songs when I watched the movie. Because of the name of the cd and the pictures from the movie on the cover it appears that they are trying to market this cd as the movie soundtrack. This is not the soundtrack from the movie.
4,Only Gospel and Hip hop,I was surprised to find more gospel and Hip hop on the album than contemporary Christian music. It's still enjoyable but i think another album with contemporary Christian music would sell well also.
4,Everyone's entitled to an opinion...,"I believe that only ""true"" music lovers could appreciate this work. Most people get ensnared in the box of their own preferred selections. I suppose we all do sometime. Nonetheless, I found the entire work enjoyable. I'm a little disappointed of others views concerning the interludes. For me, I found all three segments of the interludes to be heavenly majestic. It actually gave me a desire to worship. However, that's just me. Overall, great performance by all of the artists..."
2,Disappointed,Had high expectations after reading other reviews. Listen before you buy this one--especially if you don't prefer Gospel music.
3,This CD Almost suck totally.,"I am really 14 but I don't have an account on here. I bought this CD and I listened to the tracks, I was sure dissappointed. It's a waste of money."
2,Should read her classic book instead of this,This book is used for my development reading group. I read it in two weeks and basically couldn't understand what Jane Jacobs was talking about. I don't agree her argument that specialization is bad for development.
3,Wonderful characters,"Cornelia is a 31 year old coffee house manager, obsessed with old movies when a dashing Martin sweeps her off her feet. He's everything she dreamed about since she was a girl. She tries desperately to love him.Cornelia does love his 11 year old daughter Clare, a daughter Martin neglected to tell her about until Clare's mother abandons the preteen.Clare and Cornelia have an instant connection, one that has Martin on the outside.Enter the true love of Cornelia's life, her Childhood friend Teo who happens to also be her brother-in-law.Told in the POVs of Clare and Cornelia this is a lovely, albeit predictable story. I found the use of old movie metaphors tiresome at times. I preferred the sequel to this book, but it's still a good read."
4,None of the ussual tricks,"Or, perhaps, very few. It must be challenging to write an original book, especially with the widespread availability of them nowadays, but this book does it. It is a romance novel, written by a woman (a man could not have gotten away with saying that his character's life started the day a man walked into her shop) and full of incredibly clever and original lines.I loved it. Reminds me of ""The Carousel"" by the Evans guy. (Sorry Marisa, but it did, and I loved Carousel too)"
1,Not worth the time,"I bought this book for my book club and I have to say it just wasn't worth my money. It's trite and contrived, not well written at all. I tried so hard to wade through all the hokey descriptions of boring conversation. I tried to stick it out, but I only made it half way through the book. I regret buying it."
2,a little too romantic...,"Initially, I was really ""into"" this book but by the middle I was dragging myself through. All the old hollywood movie references were a bit much for me. They made it seem like the author was trying too hard.I must say I fell in love with the main character Cornelia. I could never really picture her in my mind but I could relate to her in so many ways. I want a friend like Linny. I would love for Ms. De Los Santos to develop the character of Linny for a novel.The themes of finding love in the most perculiar places and family were very enjoyable. I know that Cornelia rescuing Clare was noble and all but it was so out of place for me. I won't give any spoilers but the death (the first one) that occurred was certainly a twist that could have been left out. I had to really work my way through this one but the ending was worth it."
2,love walked in...,"...and I should have walked out.For the first 50 to 100 pages this book entertained me, but I found some of the writing bothersome and distracting. In four instances that I found glaringly obvious the author used a descriptive word twice in once sentence. Aren't you taught not to do that at a very early stage in the game? ""...drearily gave her dreary answer..."" and ""...hangdog dog of a question..."" - UGH!Other than that the entire story was predictable and pretty unrealistic. I'm not saying that I believe that none of these things would ever happen, but all to the same two people? I doubt it.I had high high hopes for this novel but I only struggled through the last 100 pages, and now I don't plan on picking up de los Santos' sequel, Belong to Me which is another phrase that was written throughout this one over and over and over and over again."
3,Love Walked In,This was somewhat different than my usual readings....I got into the story after a bit. Not a bad read at all. Not the normal love story but a good one.
3,Worth the read,"It took a lot for me to get through the first few chapters. It was the story of 11-year-old Clare that kept me reading. After I'd say the first 80 or 90 pages or so the story really started to open up and I just completely fell in love with it. I'm not a fast reader but I finished it within a week because I just couldn't stand not knowing what happens next. It defintely a book that captures you once you get into the real story. I hear they're making it into a movie with Sarah Jessica Parker and Dakota Fanning and I've got to say I can't think of anyone else who would be better for either part. It's definitely on my list of classic ""must reads."""
2,Very Disappointed,"Won't waste words here...I agree with most other 1 or 2 star reviewers. First half was dull, dull, dull. Somehow I kept going only to be whisked-off to fairytale land where all happy endings come true. Rubbish. The only thing I didn't notice was the bad language...must be pale compared to my own salty tongue!"
3,It kept me turning the pages BUT. . .,"This book is very involving and I had no problem wanting to read and read until the end. That said, the characters are not at all realistic except Clare and possibly her mother. Cornelia, her friends, and the people she works with are just too quirky, too cutesy, too ""special."" No one has a brother-in-law like Teo nor a best friend like Linnny. The underlying story line is so beautiful. It is too bad the author could not relax and let her characters be a little more ordinary and a little more real - not beautiful, not rich, not with such a sense of style - just people trying to connect with each other."
3,It started out with a bang!,"I loved the beginning. I could feel Claire's pain in my gut. I thought the writing was great and I loved Cornelia's character. I hated her dad and thought the author did a great job in getting me to hate her dad.I then thought that the author copped out as so many do by having a tragedy occur rather than dealing with some of the difficulties of getting out of some of the messy relationships.Another thing that really bothered me about it, and this has been spinning in my head since I finished it is the way Cornelia wrapped it up with Claire. This is so unrealistic. As a mental health professional, one can NOT do this to a child! I am furious about the way the author handled this. Claire is so vulnerable and raw and on the verge of so much loss and transition...it was not handled well....I sure hope they get this lovely girl a good therapist, pancakes is just not going to cut it to rebuild what has been broken in this little girl."
2,Cliche All the Way,"This book was chosen for our book club. I suffered through the cliche, predictable, one-dimentional character writing. I gave it 2 stars because you could read it at the beach in the dark after having a few margaritas, and easily follow the plot."
5,Beautiful Love Story,"Marisa de los Santos spoke to all the parts in my heart with her beautiful story. I related to every part of this book...even if my situations were not exactly the same, they came close. The dynamics of each relationship added to every inch of the story. I love this book and will always love it. I am looking forward to her next novel!"
2,Really disappointing and actually very boring....,"I was really hoping to agree with most of the reviews about this book. But once I got started reading it it got really boring fast. In my opinion the author overused movie actors & actresses, book titles and even songs. The first half of the book consisted of mostly references to them, and while I mostly enjoy a few references this book was flooded with them. The second half of the book was much better than the first half. Even though I found the ending to be predictable and I was very glad to have it end.I do feel the general sense of genuine true love is evident in this book, and the story itself is heartwarming. However, I don't think I will be reading any other books from this author."
4,Surprised,"Ok, this was a fast read for me. I actually finished it about a week ago while house sitting for a friend. I finished rather quickly because I couldn't stop reading. I love it when that happens. I admit that in the beginning, I got a little lost with the author's use of movie references. I obviously need to watch more old time movies. But once I got past that, the story itself was great. I love, love, love that it ended totally different than I thought it would. Kind of sad but definitely moving. I really liked it and I think you would too. Something worth reading."
4,Remarkable Debut Novel,"This is a charming yet dramatic and heart-wrenching story about the transformative power of love.It is remarkable that Marisa de los Santos, an award winning poet,somehow manages to make ""Love Walked In"" both old fashioned and hip."
4,Enjoyable literary novel,I really enjoyed the story. And the author had wonderful character development.....especially of the little girl.Pacing of the story was excellent and it was a very enjoyable read.
3,A Look At Unconditional Love,"While the style of writing drove me crazy, I am compelled to recommend this book to others. The Author's continuous references to movie lines made this book hard to read; but the characters seemed to compel me at some point to just keep going. This book will make you laugh and at times leave a lump in your throat. Most of today's fiction does not tackle mental health issues. I applaud Marisa de los Santos for bringing awareness to the mental health condition known as bipolar disorder. I liked this book because it wasn't perfect and it does not have a fairytale ending. It is however, a good example of unconditional love. While I am not sure I would read anything else from this author, I am glad I read this one to the end. Read this book and pass it on...."
3,Luminous yet annoying,"I've never read a book that was both luminous & annoying at the same time. It is a smart, beautifully descriptive story, yet I found myself thinking there was something very 'designerly' about the characters that I found very two dimensional. They could have been called Prada, or Chloe, or Dior,so perfect and even their flaws cherished and polished to a high sheen. Every heartbreak has a perfect save, and though I love happy endings, it was all a bit too tied up with shining bows & ribbons and too perfect a world, despite it's contrived tragedies, for me to find deeply satisfying.I look forward to this writer's works with another 15 years of life behind her."
3,Would have been better if told in 1/2 the time,"I read this book based on many four- and five-star reviews, but sadly, didn't feel the same. The plot is pretty good, but the story could have been told in about half the amount of pages. The author's character, Cornelia, rambles on unnecessarily about backgrounds and relationships. Everything is ""profound"" according to this character and it's ANNOYING. I found myself rolling my eyes every time she'd ramble about this movie character or that movie character, my insides screaming - ""I GET IT! MOVE ON!"" However - the story itself, the actual plot, if you can get beyond the ""MOVE ON!"" feeling, is pretty good. Read this if you have a copy hanging around... but don't expect to love it. If it weren't for the good plot idea, I would have given this two stars."
3,Over rated,This could have been an excellent book except for the obcenities and profanity. It is so unnecessary and adds only distase and disappointment. Books should be rated like movies and warnings should be given for offensive language. I cannot recommend any of the 9 books I recently ordered from Amazon to any of my youthful friends because of this. Who wants to read those words and have them constantly thrown in their face. Not me.
2,I hate this book!,"I wanted to like this book so badly...I read the first 120 pages or so, and couldn't stop reading, but I soon became disgusted. The story is so far-fetched that its predictable, if that makes any sense. Every time I thought to myself: ""There's no way something ridiculous like that is going to happen!"" it did...I wish that I had the ability to stop reading a book, but I just can't. I have about 70 pages left, and I'm hoping that I will be pleasantly surprised, but I won't count on that. I do think, however, that this would translate better to the silver screen. It seems that is already in the works."
2,Great if you want to read about unrealistic characters,"Nice idea but I feel lacks substance ...very drawn out and although you warm to the characters in the beginning I found myself losing interest half way through the book. The characters were unrealistic, (especially Clare) she was like no other child of that I age I know. Mature is one thing but she was aware of phrases, literature, languages, foreign delicacies that no other child of that age would really know about. It became forced, unrealistic & therefore I believe a divide between readers and characters grows as you read on...unfortunately."
3,Love Walked In,"I enjoyed this book even though it was entirely predictable once you get past the middle of it. I do have to say one other thing...about Martin's death. Could the author not think of any other way to get him out of the picture? It seems the writer fell short of creativity and didn't bother thinking of a more clever way to get rid of him and instead decided to just kill him off. Yes I know these things happen every day it just seemed too.. simple to me.I did love certain parts, especially everything about Clare and her story of Annikah and the Bears."
3,Unbelievable,"I did enjoy this book but it's pure fantasy. With the exception of Ollie and maybe Viviana, I don't think people like that exist in the real world. And why the emphasis on Cornelia's size?"
1,"Boring, boring, boring","I was glad to see that I wasn't the only one who thought this book was boring. I really wanted to love this book but I couldn't even finish it. Clare was just too old for her age & yes, I do know there are kids like that but she was just too much and Cornelia was just boring."
3,I call this a snuggler.,"Call this book a snuggler because it is the kind of novel that you pick up, fall in love with, and read straight through, snuggled under a warm blanket. As the chapters alternate from Clare to Cornelia, the reader alternates between love and sorrow. These women, both of them old and young in differing ways, demonstate the growth of wisdom and the loss of naiveite in two changing lives.Unfortunately, the story collasped just as it was getting good. I couldn't wait to turn the pages and find out how these characters would save themselves, only to find that contrived circumstances saved them from themselves. None of these characters worked through their problems on the written page, as you would have expected them to do, given their impeccable character development early in the story."
1,Slow Read,"I picked this book up to read while on a series of airplane flights. It was incredibly boring for the most part. The story is completely unbelievable, and the characters are under developed. The reader suspends disbelief for the enjoyment of books -- but this book took it too far. The story developed at a incredibly slow rate, but then in the last 2 chapters threw a bunch at the reader all at once. It did not have a positive effect for me. Jodi Picoult also throws a lot at the reader at the end, but in a way that fits with the rest of this story. I wish I had had other options for my flights."
5,Even better the second time around,"Since I've been unemployed, I've taken to looking at my beloved books as possible income (so sad), but I can't bring myself to part with them without one last read. Love Walked In will not be going to the used bookstore. I cannot forsake a book that engulfs me in beautifully lyric prose and characters I wish were my friends. Cornelia, Teo, Clare and Linny are the people you want around you when the world is tipping precariously. I'm hanging on by a thread, but I feel so much better now!"
4,Marisa de los Santos has won me over!,"Cornelia Brown, an intelligent and witty college grad who's in her 30's, works as a coffee shop manager in Philadelphia because she hasn't quite figured out what to do with her life yet. In walks a handsome man named Martin - a man with a cool charm that Cornelia finds attractive. Martin is also a dad - an absent dad - who ends up with his 11-year-old daughter, Clare, because her bipolar mom has had a manic break. Begins the story of Cornelia, Martin and Clare. Teo, Cornelia's longtime friend from childhood ends up in the picture and he is a great help to both Clare and Cornelia. There are some surprising twists and turns in the story that hold you. I read this book after I read ""Belong to Me"" and it was helpful for me to understand the backgrounds of the characters. Sure wish I had read it in sequence because it flowed so smoothly. I really liked this book - maybe more than her 2nd novel - and I love de los Santos' writing style."
1,Underwhelming Novel,"What got me interested in the novel was the amount of glowing reviews posted for this book. I'm sorry to say that the novel was HUGELY underwhelming. I expected to find a more sophisticated style and story and was disappointed to find instead a novel only a 12-year old could be satisfied with reading. The story was lackluster and very predictable, and the style - what can I say? I thought the characters sounded infantile, even when the story was told from Cornelia's point of view. I kept waiting for the story to get better but it never did. I gave up 3/4 of the way and threw the book in the garbage. I didn't even want to donate the book to the library or Salvation Army because it was that horrible."
1,Don't waste your time!!!!,"Where do I begin? I read some of the reviews for this book and was excited to start the book. I wasn't that into the book from the get-go and I didn't feel that the author hooked me at first. I should have listened to my gut because I forced myself to finish this book. Usually, I can finish a book in several days if I am into it, but this one took over a month. I literally just finished today and that was because I skipped most of the end. The events that take place in this book are not realistic. I can't imagine a mother leaving her child for weeks and the child's father having an accident and dying all in a matter of a month. Plus, marrying my sister's husband is not realistic at all and it's creepy. I expected soooo much more from this author."
2,"Boring, Repetitive, Uninspired","I really wanted to like this book..but, after the first few chapters - in which EVERY point is repeated too many times with too many adjectives and correlations...I gave up. I think the author has potential - good editing would help pare the story down. I'm disappointed."
1,"So very, very bad","I have to admit I lost it early on, when the narrator of this ""novel"" claims that if the reader has not yet seen a certain movie they should put the book down and go rent it immediately. I can't believe this was even published. However I have no trouble believing it's being made into a Sarah Jessica Parker movie. The only reason I gave this one star is that zero wasn't an option. One is generous."
3,PRETTY GOOD,"I FOUND THIS BOOK PRETTY GOOD. I ENJOYED THE WRITING TECHNIQUE, GOING FROM CORNELIA TO CLAIRE. IT IS TRUE AS ANOTHER REVIEW POINTED OUT, THERE IS A HAPPY EVERY THINGS PERFECT ENDING,BUT ITS FICTION. MY MAIN PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THE SWEARING AND THE UNNECESSITY OF IT. ITS INAPPROIATE AND INSULTING TO CHRISTIANS TO HEAR THEM SAYING JC AND GD."
3,"Beautifully written, too many coincidences","I read this for our library book discussion group, which is usually all women--except me. I guess this is why I like poetry and avoid ""chick lit,"" all wrapped up into one book. The language is wonderful, clearly from a poetic mind, with a poet's eye for the world and details.On the other hand, everyone in the book is beautiful or handsome, Cornelia's two men both apparently stunning head-turners. Events turn out just as Cornelia would have them, despite her sorrow at the end, she's going to have everything just as she'd want it. The right two people die at the right times (one expected, one not), the right person leaves at just the right time, and so on and on.I found myself enjoying the two voices, Clare (3rd person) and Cornelia (1st person), but rolling my cynical eyes at the coincidences and inevitable handsomeness/beauty of the people in the book."
2,Love Walked In,Purchases the book based on her novel Belong to Me which I loved. Didn't get past two chapters of this book. :(
2,Disappointmentville: Love Walked In by Marisa de los Santos,"2.5 out of 5 stars, this is a moving story about what happens when love comes to you in unexpected ways. I really did not enjoy this story, mostly because I hated Clare's parents (Martin & Viviana). They were both too self-involved for my liking. Plus, even though the ending was sweet and I liked who Cornelia ended up with, it still didn't end the way it should have.I don't recommend this book but it you decide to read it then I say I hope you'll enjoy it more then I did.On a side note -- I loved Cornelia and the way she was described. Since she's described as being quirky, a small woman, with dark short hair, and all I kept thinking about was how she was just like Kristan Higgins' Cordelia fromUntil There Was You (Hqn).Review By: From Me to You ... Book Reviews(read more of this review and a teaser of my blog)"
2,A Struggle of A Story,"Between the exaggerated tangents and the classic movie references, a moving story emerges and collapses. De los Santos' child character (Clare) exudes depth, ingenuity, and foresight while the adult characters stumble into emotional moments and occasional epiphanies. De los Santos does bring awareness to a troubling trend, children raising themselves (growing up before their time) because of our ""me"" society. A struggle of a story, two stars."
2,I don't get why people like this so much.,I ordered this book along with Belong to Me. I usually read nonfiction books but thought I would give a fiction book a try and this one had good ratings and the second installment was only $5. The story line was alright. Nothing exciting. What really irritated me was the way de los Santos writes. She pretty much babbles on and on about useless nonsense and she knows it because her main character will stop herself when she realizes she is babbling. This book frustrated me to no end which has never happened to me before. I had a hard time finishing it because it seemed like she just couldn't get to the point. I donated the second installment of this book before I even opened it. This type of writing probably appeals more to a dreamer type personality opposed to a fact seeking mind which is why I should probably stick to nonfiction books.
5,Great book!,"This is a great book, and the very first one from this author. The character development is endearing and addicting...leaving you wanting more. Fortunately, there IS more, her sequel to this, ""Belong to Me,"" is even better! Enjoy."
4,A beautifully written story,"This book is beautiful. De los Santos has a flawless way of describing emotion. You fall in love with Cornelia and Claire and it really is a book you want to pass on to your favorite people - it touches the heart.My only major issue with the book, and maybe the author did this on purpose as a way to describe Cornelia's intelligence, was that there were several ""S.A.T."" words that throw you off right in mid-sentance. Embarassingly enough, I had to look up several of the words so I could really understand what was being said. This is also a personal pet peeve of mine and therefore bothers me a bit more then it should. I have always found using overly-complex words to describe something fairly simple as pretentious and unnecessary.Regardess of this however, the author is a beautiful story teller. It was a refreshing and timeless read."
4,Good Quick Read,"Although the story deals with a difficult family situation, it is a quick light read. You instantly fall in love with the characters and just want the best for all of them."
3,"nice outside, poor inside",the metal outside is great..but the interior is not well done with staples holding down the wood bars..
2,very disappointed,"The quaility of the game was a lot less than I expected. That's the trouble with buying online as opposed to buying in a store. If I had seen how cheap it was made in a store , I wouldn't have bought it."
1,Cheap over priced junk,This claims to be 14kt but the belly ring turns copper colored inside the bellyring hole. It also causes soreness and other issues.
1,Low quality product,I picked this sushi kit based on the high customer rating. It turns out to be a great disappointment. The sushi roller is made of flimsy sticks tied loosely together by 5 strings. And the strings at the tie-end are hanging out carelessly; they didn't bother to trim the knot. It is a typical made-in-china crappy product. I cannot understand why/how it received a 4 and half star rating.
3,Entry Level,"If you are SERIOUS about your sushi, this is NOT for you. If you are just a beginner then this may be a good product with which to start."
4,Bought this kit for the mat.,"I bought this little kit for the bamboo mat. I couldn't locate it in my local stores so I purchased this as a larger group of items with free shipping. The spoon that comes with it is cheap wood; as for the price you would expect that. It takes on colors and stains. The bamboo mat is of good quality with no problems. I wrap mine in saran wrap when using to make life much easier. The pamphlet is a neat additive, but a book is recommended to be used then this pamphlet to get started."
3,It'll do for the price,"Joyce Chen Sushi KitNot a lot here other kits I had came with a sushi knife..and a sharp one for that. But, what do you expect for $4? It'll do. Besides, it's really harder than then make it look on TV."
4,Another fine showing for Inspector Maigret,"One of the things that makes these books so interesting after all these years is that they don't depend on any 'slight of hand' tricks to make the mysteries. Each story evolves from a situational point of view and then is followed (sometimes doggedly) by the Inspector and his cohort to the logical ending. What does make them especially intriguing is the background discussions of the people and places involved in the story. It's great insight into France in between the World Wars.This story is based on a small crossroads (carrefour) on the outskirts of Paris. The area is just being discovered because it is finally reachable by 'motorcar'. The changing sociology caused by the the use of long-haul trucking to bring produce and food into Paris is marvelously described in detail by Simenon. The pride in the owning of an 'motorcar', that sets one apart as both modern and mobile is also intriguing. A fine story."
5,Wow! What a story!,"Dragon Sword and Wind Child is a wonderful, fascinating book set in ancient Japan when Gods and humans walked the earth at the same time. Saya is a well-written beleivable charactor that is very confused when it comes to personal matters. Chihaya is very innocent, but also very powerful. I most definately reccomend this book to anyone in search of a good historical fiction book."
5,Heart Touching,"Nothing I have ever read has so plainly made such a great impression upon my heart as this book. It definitely tops my list. Your feelings grow as you read this phenomeonal story about a young woman growing to except the world and the truths her loves hold, when staring her in the face is her true love. This book represents everything: good versus evil; love; hate; happiness; distruction; and most importantly the love that carries the hearts of its readers through to the end. This book is suspenseful and my pages are stained with tears every time I read it. If anyone needs an escape from the harsh reality we live today, they definitely should read this book. I believe it would to everyone good and enrich their lives, hearts, and minds if this book went to print again."
5,One of My favorite Books!!,"In my lifetime I have read many books. Some good, some bad. But this I THOROUGHLY enjoyed reading this book. In Dragon Sword and Wind Child a teenage orphan girl who finds herself in a world of war, gods, pain, but also of compassion and love. As she meets many new people this young girl strives to find herself."
2,"Purpose to promote NFP, not provide a book to read for fun","The story is not bad; the premise is decent and the writing is fine, though not great.The problem I had with this book is that it changes about halfway through to become a book on NFP disguised as a story. As a tool to promote NFP and Catholic doctrine, it's not bad. As a book to read purely for the enjoyment of the story, however, it limps along to the end."
2,Disappointing,"Started out okay, a little cutesy and fake, but turned into a Catholic diatribe. Had to stop reading before I could finish it, it became so cheesy and over the top I could no longer stomach it."
2,Just couldn't finish it,"I am not usually one to go back and write a review, but I felt that I should this time. Rarely do I put down a book before I reach the end, but this was one of those books I just could not finish. I really tried to stay interested in it, but I just didn't succeed. I started skimming paragraphs, then pages, then ended up skipping entire pages trying to get back in to the book. The story line was a good idea but the book was not carried out very well. This book was seemingly written to promote NFP and abortion issues, with an afterthought to entertain readers. Too much of the characters telling why they believe what they believe about the aforementioned issues, and not enough plot.EHuff"
1,Glad it was free,"This book wasn't for me. Going back and forth between the past and the present was fine. I love books that discuss prayer, God, living a life for the Lord, but this one didn't do it for me. When I had read over 50% of the book and still wasn't happy with it, I just started flipping pages of pages (virtual pages) and then I would read part of the page and I felt like I hadn't missed anything. There were several chapters that were just repeats of the previous chapters. I did go to the end with the book to see if it had a good ending and it did. I'm glad it was a free book, I would have been VERY disappointed if I had paid for it.I think this is the first time I've ever written a ""bad"" review."
2,"preachy, not much story","I ended up skimming over the present day parts in the last half of the book b/c I was done being preached at. I have used NFP in the past (as well as the cousin FAM), but I don't want to be preached at, especially since the last half of this book (in the present day portions) was all preaching and no plot, character development or real story, just preaching about NFP."
4,Great story,"The story was great, and very moving, but the writing was a little rough in places and could have used some polishing by an editor. I have read another book by this author(""In Name Only"")and the writing is much improved. This author is obviously very passionate about here writing and her subject manner."
2,Too small to be useful!,"Ordering this book taught me a valuable lesson: take note of the SIZE of the book before buying. This book is so small that it fits in the palm of your hand. Some people might find this ""cute"", but it makes the book very difficult to read (particularly near the spine). The author, Christopher Tadgell, has written a number of brilliant works, but this little volume has so little space that it can only scratch the barest surface of the Chinese architectural tradition."
5,Benade is One of the Greats in This field,"I studied with Dr. Benade, taking his course in musical acoustics, at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, some years ago. Dr. Benade was a brilliant and dedicated scientist in the area of musical acoustics, but he was highly opinionated and sometimes inflexible. He refused to accept, for example, that flutes could produce ""whisper tones"", a standard 20th Century player's/composer's technique which I have used many times in my compositions (and can perform myself on the flute).Nonetheless, this book is a very important book to read and own if you are interested in the fundamentals of the acoustics of musical instruments (not performing spaces as other reviewers have pointed out). This book was the text which Benade used to teach his courses. Add this to your collection of musical acoustics books...and be sure to include ""Horns Strings and Harmony"", Benade's earlier book, as well as the book by John Pierce and of course the book by Helmholtz."
3,"I like this book, value it as a reference, but it's outdated","Long ago this was a standard text on musical acoustics. I still keep it on my shelf of acoustics books, but would caution anyone starting out that the book is very outdated in style, choice of topics, and focus. That said, I find it often handy to have more than one textbook style to study material from. Smooths out the choices of topics and the idiosyncrasies of the authors.So, if you're looking to supplement an acoustics text, or looking at the history of acoustics, go for this book. For a starting textbook you'd be better served elsewhere. Rossing for example."
2,Very outdated,"Of historical interest only, this book never was a comprehensive overview of musical acoustics, instead focusing on Benade's interests. Now, it is horribly outdated. Much interesting work is not in here...in fact there is no really top notch acoustics book with modern research available at this time."
2,Hard Core Physics,"I purchased this book as it was recommended by one respected guitar maker. Turns out this is a heavy duty physics book on sound. It is mostly theory and very little applied physics/engineering that would help me in building better sounding guitars or musical instruments. If you are interesting in building better sounding guitars you are better off listening to or reading books and videos by William Cumpiano and Ervin Somogyi. Just my opinion, I would save my money and get their books. I rate this book at two stars for those who feel you need to suffer with advanced sound physics concepts."
5,Just about everything,This book is close to exhaustive and can be an excellent addition to any reference library.
1,Toots his horn too much,"I was looking for a book to enrich my knowledge of acoustics and musical instruments. Having a BS in mechanical engineering, I am not a stranger to differential equations, but I don't particularly want to spend my leisure time solving them. This book is not for someone like me. This book is for someone who wants to read a novel about musical acoustics. Physical descriptions are not concise, but rife with draw out analogies. The ideas are miles apart. After having read a good deal of technical material I have come to expect a certain cold precision in descriptions of physical phenomena. This book doesn't deliver what I wanted. Now I get to decide if it is really worth the effort of extracting whatever knowledge I can."
5,This killed me the first time but it gets easier!,"I thought I was going to die the first time I did this workout. I've been doing it for two weeks now and I can actually finish the exercises. Jaime is very encouraging, (he makes it look so easy) and before you know it, it's over. Anyone can fit 8 minutes into their day. Believe me, after a couple weeks, you'll really notice a difference in your body."
5,CONSISTENTLY CORRECT CARDIO +,...If you do these videos CORRECTLY & CONSISTENTLY alongwith PROPER nutrition/cardio you will get great results. If you do the video BUT continue to eat junk & do no cardio you will get no results! After I did it my boyfriend went crazy because my booty was so nice! hehe
5,"A Fan from Seminole, Florida","I used this video a few years ago after having a baby. It helped me get rid of that ""pooch"" of a tummy below my waist in a hurry. Now at 46 and needing to tone up I have turned to it again. After buying and borrowing several different work out videos I still think this is the best. For those people like me who don't have an hour a day to work out, this is the one for you. You get a work out in 2 important areas in under 20 minutes! The countdown timer is a great incentive to keep going and you WILL see results in just a week or 2. Just get started and you will actually look forward to doing these exercises everyday!"
4,Hard at First.. But it gets easier,"I thought that this might be the ""easy"" way to get a flat stomach. Well, it is getting there, but easy is not how I would put it! It is a quick workout that does produce results, but you have to work into it! I would recommend it to anyone that does not have alot of time to work on the abs and wants to see some improvement"
4,good,"i had the tape before, lent it to someone who lost it and I was just replacing it, the other person did not have the common sense to replace it"
5,quick delivery,My video came very quickly and was in very good shape! Thank you for being so efficient! I would love to do business with you again.
2,Not recommended,"I was surprised to find that there is only one 8 minute workout on each tape, unlike the Abs of Steel tapes which contain 3 workouts to rotate. The actual content of the tapes varied. The moves on the abs tape were customary and effective, although after doing the same routine daily for a while it would likely lose its impact. The buns video was not as effective and terribly hard on the knees. I had concerns about the form and discontinued doing it to be on the safe side. Both tapes are extremely fast paced and it is important to move at your own speed so that your moves are done safely and properly. Don't try to keep up with the host, he moves much too quickly.Overall, I dont recommend this film. The abs of steel series are a better value with more diverse workouts, and some quick biking will do the backside more good than 8 minute buns."
3,great for abs not so for buns,i have been on doing this workout for nearly 2 months now. and it has given me some results though not much for the lower abs. it was not as hard as i thought it would be.the buns excersice it absolutely horrible to do the position gives me a shoulder pain and seems more targeted for the legs than the butt.even now i find it hard to complete the buns video.
4,As described,"The book was as described by the seller. I was no stranger to it, having borrowed it many times at the library, and would recommend it to everyone interested in visiting the northern regions."
3,Fan is very noisy.,"Fan is bit too noisy. You can hear it start and stop. May be thats why this laptop has HK speakers (although the speakers can be better!). Laptop becomes very hot if used for more than 15-20 mins. I ordered one from Amazon. It arrived after a week, but with some dents on the topside. So I am returning the product back to Amazon. The design is great! It looks stylish (looks better than Thinkpad), not very heavy (~6 lbs), awesome screen!A huge harddrive (60GB), good memory (512 MB RAM) but no DVD-RW drive, which is ok for me, since it has CD-RW. For a student like me, who does only weekend travels, this laptop is just perfect, except the NOISY fan, which is really irritating sometimes. May be Toshiba should supply some earplugs with this model!"
4,The Woodshed  - Forty Miles Of Rough Road,"The Woodshed continue their long, dub-infected acid tracks, this time starting off their album FORTY MILES OF ROUGH ROAD with the slightly dreamy ""Crop Duster,"" which keeps it real with some electric blues guitar stabs. ""Holloway to Memphis"" mostly lays off the acid for a mellow, almost deep house experience. ""Shootin' Cactus"" maintains its their low and slow pace but bring back the acid (a tempo continued on ""No""), while ""Return of Yet I"" goes for mysterious, like the slowest alien invasion ever, and the low thrum of ""Scuffletown Scuffle"" is like diving in a dub submersible until ""Space Junk"" brings things back up. ""A Tale from the Woodshed: Part One"" delves into some ambient tones at the start until the keyboard pounds out a quiet melody which, naturally enough, leads into the beats of ""Part Two."" It's a road you can drive down again and again."
5,A Must Have for Traveling,"This little book is worth its weight in gold (as are the others in the series). There are separate sections for appetizers, main courses, veggies, desserts, etc. I was never surprised by what the waiter brought - it was always what I intended to order. I have used this book in Spain, Mexico and in several South American countries. If you do not speak Spanish, then do not travel to a Spanish speaking country without it."
2,Confused,"I have been a science fiction/fantasy book fan for as long as I can remember. For some reason, I never was really attracted to any of Lackey's books. Out of desperation of nothing to read, I bought two from a book store. The Black Swan was an ok book, but nothing that was really gripping or exciting. The second book was Winds of Fate. I hate starting a trilogy without reading it in order. First, the book was just confusing. Never reading any of the previous novels concerning the background of the story, I had no idea what was being discussed half the time. Once I got into the swing of things, and began to get a little interested, I discovered I bought a misprinted copy! I have A page of chapter 11, then it goes to chapter 13, then back to chapter 12. ??? Anybody else have this problem??"
4,I think that the book speaks for itself.,"In this book Elspeth, heir to the throne of Valdemar, goes in search of someone to teach her to use her magic in the defense of her kingdom. Unknowingly, she steps right into the middle of someone elses war also- the Taledras (sp?) vs. Falconsbane. This is my favorite series of all time, but ""Winds of Change"" and ""Winds of Fury"" were far better than this book, in my own opinion. This book is a little slow, with some great kicks here and there, but it doesn't really get doing until Elspeth and Darkwind meet. The ending (and the rest of the series) make it well worth the read! If you have read this book and are discouraged by how slow you thought it went through most of it, I encourage you to go ahead and try the next two in the series. They are much faster paced and well worth the read. The book has a good plot and good characters, and all and all, is a worthwhile read, and a good book."
1,Kindle Version only,"This is about the Kindle format book only, and not a comment on the quality of the story. Many of Mercedes Lackey's Kindle versions of her books (not just this one) are beset with the most egregious typos, misspellings, and issues with italics. Now when books are digitized it appears that paper versions are fed into a drum scanner and then OCR'd - well, whoever did this batch did not take the time to edit afterward and turned off the spell check on the OCR, probably because of all of the Shin'a'in words in it. Buy the Kindle versions only if you've already read the paper versions. And, shame on Amazon for selling such inferior stuff! They ought to have the good grace to check the quality of their stuff before they sell it."
2,Beware!,Kindle readers beware!! The typos in the electronic version of this book are atrocious. I honestly couldn't believe what I was seeing. How this ever got past even a single copy-editor is beyond me. If you really want to read this save yourself the anguish and just go out to your local book store and pick up the paperback--trust me.
3,Unfortunately you have to read this for the other 2,"This is by far in my oppinion the worst of her books. I found the plot overly contrived. I feel that the charaters in the book do things that are frankly out of character. Above and beyond all that I did find it readable. I just had to ignore my mind saying, . . .oh come on would he/she really do something that stupid? I would say to read this book however. The next two in the series are much better and far less contrived. Not on par with Misty's usual standard :("
4,Another great start of (so far) another great trilogy!,"Mercedes Lackey jumps right off into action in this book, but then during the middle section it lulls and just chit-chat goes on. There is very much action/adventure in this book and very little romance. The action really heats up when Darkwind meets Elspeth and they team up to try and defeat Falconsbane. There's about 7 or so pages of top-notch battle action there. For all fantasy fans, you might want to give this author a try; I've read another one of her trilogies(The Mage-Storms,) which was excellent and I look forward to reading the sequel to this one(Winds of Change). Once again, all fantasy fans should give this author a try; I think you'll like her."
3,"Fantasy Bloat, some interesting points","Herald Elspeth is the heir to the kingdom of Valdemar and a rather difficult person to like. Darkwind is a 27 year old Tayledras scout/wizard. This novel alternates between both characters and their respective lives as their paths slowly join.I admit, I didn't empathize with Elspeth. She's too whiney and I don't like the way she treats her companion. I also think she handled the situation with Skif poorly. Darkwind is ok, but a little too cookie cutter, and the relationship between him and the seventeen year old scout skeeved me out. Also his scenes at times were boring.Overall this was an OK novel. I found the parts with the gryphons a bit strange, and the sections told from Darkwinds POV were bland.Overall: 3 star read."
5,very interesting and unusual book,"A poetical biography of Robert Johnson, blues musician. The story is told through a series of poems, so check with your child's teacher before you choose it for a report. The illustrations are fascinating, and it's fun to play his music, or other blues music, while you read and talk about this with your kids. There is a good summary/timeline at the back of the book.Two cautions:1) The book mentions the legend that Robert Johnson ""sold his soul to the devil"" to become a musician. In our family, we don't play around with stuff like that, so I had to address that up front.2) Poisoned to death at age 27, legend has it by a jealous husband. This book does mention hundreds of love affairs and jealous husbands. Moms and dads need to know what their young ones are reading.The grown-up subject matter makes this book better for junior high students and older, and the illustrations are so interesting that this will not come across as ""just a kids' book.""Very well done."
5,"""The Nitrogen Cycle""","This book is the key to the closet, where we keep everything that we never use and rarely want. Tate has a keen gift of putting a tear in one eye and a wrinkle in the other. This is where he is most commonly misunderstoond. A friend of mine, after reading Tate's latest book told me that he felt the poet was merely trying to show how silly and zany that he could be. His poems are often funny and even absurd, but there is a painful sadness hidden in them. ""The Nitrogen Cycle"" puts a smile on your face. But, the next minute you are pondering the frail nature of the human mind. This book should be read with plate of cookies and dull knife."
3,What a terrible book.,I am currently using this text for my Advanced Spanish Grammar and Composition class. This book is not very good. Most explanations that this text gives are very short and do not go in depth on many topics. The exercises are not very helpful either. Many of the sentences you must construct or examples given are very silly and make absolutely no sense. I am a native Spanish speaker and I do not think this book is very user friendly. I also did not like the fact that the answers are not in the back of the book. This makes correcting ones mistakes very difficult to do. I do not agree with the other reviewers who said this book was good. It has some good things but overall I do not find myself recommending this book. Overall I can not recommend this book.
5,Great Valentine's Day Gift!,"I loved this book! Debby Caruso has the ability to put us in touch with the young girl inside all of us - that young girl we so often forget about in this fast-paced and confusing world. If you have a teenaged to twentysomething daughter, buy her this book to convince her of the promise of true love. If not, read it yourself to bring back a time of love and friendship in your own life. Ms. Caruso creates a bond between the reader and characters that makes you feel like they live in your own neighborhood. Yes ladies, there is someone for everyone! A FEEL GOOD BOOK AND A DEFINITE MUST READ!! I hope this is the first of many from this up and coming author."
5,Look out ladies! True love lives on!,"Ladies, This book is a must read! Debby Caruso brings you on a journey back to the days of first love. One must experience the rush of this emotional roller coaster. Laugh, love,cry with each turn of the page! Daria Gabbamonte is an image from the past that opens the doors of love deep within each of us. Sure to leave you with butterflies in your stomach!!!"
1,Get the size right,"I ordered two of these pantyhose for my wife who was prescribed this item for veinous problems. Using their size chart I ordered M that was undersized. My wife said it was like trying to put on a pair of boots where the heel won't pass the ankle area. I called the 877 number and was told to email the company. No one answered, just an ""unavailable"" message. No one answered the emails. Unlike reputable companies, that provide return instructions, they had none. I will have to order the larger size because it is medically necessary. If these are non-fitting, the next step will be the Better Business Bureau.Do NOT order this product if you have not been fitted at a doctor's office."
4,"Great Bag, But Too Small for a large DSLR","This bag is constructed well and fit a small camera without any trouble. I was hoping to fit my semi-pro DSLR in it with a zoom lens as my ""emergency"" set-up, but it was too small. Now I use it for something else."
2,JUNK,Need better description put it on a 6.5hp go kart and it does not have enough power to engage it so it just burns up look it up online and it describes for a junior snomobile or dirt bike not a small go kart
3,Fell apart...,"Long story short, the clutch busted completely apart while the cart was in motion. Occurred about 3 hours into operation. Our mechanic isn't stellar by any means, but this was an easy install and I can't imagine he did it improperly. Cart is an old beater, but we ordered the same spec clutch it ran on for 20 years without incident. Either way, I have to go 3/5 to give the clutch the benefit of the doubt."
2,"looks like much more expensive watch, but no battery???",I just received this watch - love the look - but the watch did not work. I assume there is no battery or the battery is dead - still need to check as a special tool is required to open the case.
4,Good for the price,"The product works as described. Action is not particularly smooth, but does the job. Could use some lubricating grease to improve. A good buy for the price."
5,Great!,"Glides smoothly and effortlessly.I used these to make modeling stands for sculptures, and when I'm not sculpting on them I enjoy standing on the stands I have made with these and swiveling around. I weigh about 125 lbs and they seem unaffected. I have not tested the limit of 750 lb. though, but for my purposes they have been great."
5,Was just what I ordered!,"Was just what I ordered, I put it under my monitor and now it swivels. It is barely noticeable and works well, fast sipper, would buy again!"
1,Not For Gray,I have yet to find a Henna that covers Gray Hair. This one guarantees it and still it did nothing to my gray. Even after I left it on for more then an hour. Henna only seems to be a conditioner or color for anything but Gray hair.
3,Covers gray if you use red first,"I've been using another brand of henna for years to cover gray with a 2-step process: first you color your hair red, rinse out the red henna (but don't shampoo), let dry, then apply brown. Leave the brown on for twice as long as recommended. This takes extra time, but it does the trick. For me it's worth it because henna is the only thing I can use to color my hair that doesn't ruin my fine hair's texture."
2,Got a weird taste in my mouth.,"After applying this to my head, within about 5 minutes, I started to get the weirdest ""chemically"" taste in my mouth. I rinsed it out of my hair. In that short 5 minutes, it had already stained my hair really well, it looked good. The color lasted a long time. But since I use henna to avoid chemicals, I wouldn't use this again. I am super-sensitive to skin and hair products, so maybe it would work for someone else without this weird ""side-effect"". It's too bad, I would so like a reasonably priced, pre-mixed henna solution."
2,Beware Sizing,"The item seems reasonably well made, but the sizing appears to be correct for children or pygmies. I'm 6-ft, 240 lbs, and the XL (largest) size won't go over my calf. However, they make acceptable elbow protectors for bicycling, and the vendor wants me to pay for return shipping, so I'm keeping them."
3,way to big,"this item is the same product as the california xxl plug, just red, its over 14.5 inch is cir, way to big, i mean, i wana hear from someone who really can use this"
2,Get a Different Guide,"I like Rick Steve, but he dropped the ball on this book. Entries are confusing: he introduces a site, and then doesn't tell you how to get there. The maps are terrible. But the thing that really irked me was his section on driving in the Czech Republic. He said that there were road ""tolls"" you could avoid by purchasing a sticker for your car. That is just plain false. There are no tolls at all. If you do not purchase that sticker, the Czech cops will stop you and fine you anywhere from 500 to 15,000 Crowns. 1000 Crowns = about $45. That's what our friendly Czech officer hit us with."
4,Good Travel Book,I really enjoyed this book because it helped me navigate through scenic Prague with it's maps of different parts of the city that you would want to explore. I find this book a little confusing when it came to location of the restaurants but had no problem with finding all the site seeing places. Overall good book but can be improved with a little better restaurant directions.
5,true Moroccan grocery bag,"Best grocery bag, or drycleaner bag, or school book bag for a teacher... anything bag. I am Moroccan and this is truly Moroccan and very well priced..."
3,Bobby Darin in a western?,"""Gunfight in Abilene"" is a faithful re-make of 1956's ""Showdown at Abilene."" Why anyone would choose to make another movie of this minor material, and why anyone would then decide to cast Bobby Darin in the role once played by Jock Mahoney, are mysteries for which there may be no solutions. By 1967, B-westerns had about run their course but as B-westerns go, this is competently made, despite its central miscasting, with occasional flashes of interest along the way. It has a pleasing song, (heard through the opening credits), which was written by Darin and it has a scene in which Michael Sarrazin is stripped to the waist, tied to the back of a wagon, and flogged. In the book, ""Lash! The Hundred Great Scenes of Men Being Whipped in the Movies,"" this flogging ranks 58th. Otherwise, there's not much here to recommend but fans of B-westerns will probably find this ""Gunfight"" tolerable."
3,Looking forward to the DVD release,"This was the bottom half of a Universal double bill shown in UK cinemas, but a perfectly watchable low budget western with Darin well cast, and shot on the familiar Universal backlot.Bad guy Leslie Neilsen's ranch headquarters is the Shiloh set from 'The Virginian' as if anyone in a 1967 audience didn't recognise it! Ex Ford stuntman Frank McGrath (Wooster in Wagon Train) makes one his final appearances in a wheelchair.Hopefully a good clean print will soon be added to the Universal Vault series."
4,Rating: A/A- ; humorous light fantasy.,"Business has been slow for Hali, and she's stuck in an irritatingly tidy A-frame with a blue plastic roof. When her boss Bentwood comes up with a scheme to lure fantasy gamers to the Inner World as tourists, she agrees to help in exchange for a properly spooky witch's hut... There are few surprises in this first novel, but the cheerful tone and amusing skits keep the pages turning."
5,Lighthearted fantasy,"This book has a little bit of everything - and all of it well done! Fantasy, role playing, magic, romance, fairy tale, dry humor, and mythical creatures are all in this one. The good (Hali), the bad (snotty elflord), and the ugly (Bentwood) combine to keep you entertained throughout the book. I recommend this book highly. My only complaint is that there is no sequel. I would definitely like to see more like this."
4,Rating: A/A-humorous light fantasy.,"Business has been slow for Hali, and she's stuck in an irritatingly tidy A-frame with a blue plastic roof. When her boss Bentwood comes up with a scheme to lure fantasy gamers to the Inner World as tourists, she agrees to help in exchange for a properly spooky witch's hut... There are few surprises in this first novel, but the cheerful tone and amusing skits keep the pages turning."
2,Fighting Spirit a dud.,"This video had a bad sound track and even stops at certain points. When sent back for a refund, I only got half my money back. Don't waste your money."
2,A bit disappointing,"Of course, my appreciation depends on what I've already seen.This is not about the fighting spirit of old Japan. It's about the modern versions of older systems which are by now widely known outside Japan. What strikes me most is the casualness of Shimuzu sensei and that's something I noticed with other people of his renown. Compared to what is now taught he's worse than casual, not to use other words. So, viewed from our present angle, he's bad. Or is it the other way round? Are we to obsessed with beautiful form and is the content lost? A way to transfer energy without doing it?"
2,why do I need to read this?,"I don't know after I finished this book. And reading this book is definitely not an enjoyable experience. The worst thing is the writer wrote this book into a math book. The worst of the worst, it's a math book with 'n', 'N', 'k', 'lambda'... all these messed up. It takes unnecessary effort to figure out the dimensions of matrixes and vectors. After all the torture, I cannot find a tiny bit of physical meaning attached behind. The problems are remotely connected with the text. I cannot do the problems after I read the text twice, or I cannot even understand what the problems are talking about. As an engineering student, I believe the underlying essence of any theory is simple. It's the writer used 560 pages to make it complicated and confusing and the student now have to do the reverse work."
4,Another season one more to GO!,I watched this series when I was a kid and when it was on nicktoons now I have the first two seasons on dvd and soon will add season three and four when it gets released. I hope shout does a complete series set like Rocko as well the other shows deserve one as well.
5,Ahhhh!!! Real Monsters: Season Three,"I have been a fan of Aahh!!! Real Monsters for a long time and it is wonderful seeing the series again. These were the best cartoons that Nick offered and I hated seeing this series, Rocko, Rugrats, Hey, Arnold! and Angry Beavers taken off. I am glad we have the opportunity to get these cartoons again."
3,A light travel/beach read,"This collection of four mysteries about blondes isn't earth shattering, but it's a cute read suitable for riding on the subway or lying on the beach. Some of the mysteries end up being quite silly (&without any real clues to help you figure them out), but the storeies do get progressively better as the book continues. The Dead End Job and the Psychic Eye mysteries were my favorites...the writing was a bit better with more developed characters and more intense mysteries. I suggest taking this book out from a library or buying it used. While it's not really bad, you might not want to spend full price for this mystery anthology."
3,`Drop Dead Blonde' four murder mystery stories in one book.,`Slay Belles' by Nancy Martin tells the story Lucy who is ex-debutante and hot mafia man who solve a high-end department store murder.`Killer Blonde' by Elaine Viets does a flash back to the 1970's telling a dead-end job mystery.`Dead Blondes Tell no tales' by Denise Swanson the best book of all the four. This tells the story of Skye who spend her spring break week working at her boyfriends mothers `Bunny' bowling ally. Bunnies' friend arrives from Vegas and then the chaos mystery unfolds. The romantic tension between the Skye's current boyfriend a funeral home director and hot local police chief is electric. I am off to find more books by this author.`Blind sighted' by Victoria Laurie finds Abby Cooper at Psychic convention and solving a murder with the help of her rich sister and spunky elderly lady. I am off to read more of the Psychic Eye Mysteries.
4,"Good anthology, but...","I really liked the DROP-DEAD BLONDE anthology, which I bought for the short story by Victoria Laurie. Unfortunately, other than the characters being the same, it doesn't really fit into her Psychic Eye Mysteries series. Definitely read the other stories in the Psychic Eye Mysteries series, but don't worry if you read this one out of chrological (by publication date) order."
1,Drop-Dead Blonde DOA,"This book included 4 short stories written by different authors. Nancy Martin's entry was good. So was one of the others, but two of them were awful. Bad plotting abominable editing, poor knowledge of basics of English grammar made them much less than good reading. I'm surprised Nancy Martin would allow her work to be published with such a waste of my time and all the other readers too. This book is available in paper at very high prices. I hope no one is fooled into wasting their money"

2,A minimal volume,"This is another of the British writer's series of historical maps, this time on the USA. The maps are unfortunately rather simplistic graphically, and the author cannot provide much at all in the way of narrative. He even falls for a famous American political hoax; his 19th Century Railroad Landgrant map was actually concocted by railroad opponents of the time and is so cartoonish it should have been suspected, even by a Brit.This slim volume is going to be of limited interest to just about anyone."
5,Swept Away,"I bought this as a present and for myself, mostly because of the water/sand proof novelty. But as soon as I started reading through the selections of short stories, I was mesmerized and lost in the tides of other beach worlds. It was one thing not to worry about getting the book wet, and certainly another to be entranced by the story selection. As all the stories had an ocean feel, you couldn't help but look up from your beach chair and search for that shark in the cove, or the largest dead man that floated into a small ocean-side village. Loved it, and hope to see another selection soon!"
5,Cute book!,My daughter was into all things ballet so I knew this book would be great. She has enjoyed it since we bought it 2 years ago. I can't say anything bad about the book. Its cute.
1,Hook breaks off easily,"Lasted about a month. Then the hook broke off. The metal of the hook looks soft and brittle, not even the same quality as a common hardware variety hook.Also the stand has an annoying habit of disassembling itself when one lifts the banana off the hook.Also the little hook looks cute, but seems poorly angled to make hanging and unhanging a bunch of bananas easy.Guess I am not impressed with the function of this product."
1,poor,i received video late and it does not show a clear picture throughout showing of tape very disappointed uissed amazon before no problems like this
2,Zumba Advanced DVD,"I thought this DVD was the same one I owned in VHS form. It is not even though both are titled ""Advanced"" and have the same cover design. I am disappointed in it."
2,"Ok, but the new Zumba is much better!",This is the older version of Zumba Advanced. The New version is much better. In this old version is ok but you get much less music and a much shorter workout. If you like Zumba you should definitely go for the Newer Advanced Zumba (green cover) It is worth it.
3,Fun but wanted more intensity,I enjoyed this DVD. It is lots of fun and the time flew by b/c it was constantly changing and that is a good thing! I was wishing it was a bit more intense but it made working out fun.
5,I have found tv again,"I have had this set for 2 months now, and have fell in love. HD and regular programing looks great. With great color and control of the picture. What else can I say..."
5,Randy California (Wolfe) Lives On!,"Yes, R. California (California name given to him by Hendrix to distinguish between the two Randys in his pre-Experience band) lives on. I'm not much of a reviewer, but I've always been a Spirit fan. A lot of their early music was overlooked, but not even close to their later music. This is a sad shame because there is a massive amount of music released after California's death...and more yet to be released. If you are just rediscovering Spirit, check this cd out. It has a great variety of styles (as was Spirit's way from the very beginning) and it is an enjoyable listen. Did I like it all? No, but I did like the majority of it. I'll leave it to that. I'm no music critic and what little I don't like on a cd, someone else will love. Buy this! You'll enjoy most of it if not all...and the stuff you don't enjoy you'll appreciate!"
4,Great for different ages.,"I gave this book to my 2 year old grandson for his birthday. He absolutely loved it! He didn't want to play with anything else. For a child that young an adult will need to help. The tabs can be torn and can be a bit difficult to pull out. This is a book a 2 year old can't use alone, but most kids that young need to be supervised with paper books anyway. I have no problem recommending this book. An adult needs to participate to read the information about the birds. The birds are easily recognisable. You flip up the page to get bird info, pull the tab to see the bird and press the button to hear the sound it makes. It would be very suitable for an older child that is reading. I love this book and would purchase it again."
4,Great Book but don't expect to keep it nice,This is a great book for teaching birds and bird calls for eight birds. Our 16-month-old LOVES this book. I did have to work with her to show her how to pull the tabs without tearing the book apart. She can now do it but the tabs are all bent and worn. The buttons are somewhat hard to press too but with practice she can work them. She brings me this book every day to go through with her.
2,Very disappointing bells and whistles,"I was very excited to get this book for my one year old, bird-loving daughter after reading other posted reviews. The bird call buttons only worked for a day. I assumed that the battery was dead, so attempted to change it, but couldn't find a screwdriver minute enough to fit the miniscule screw and had to give up. The pull flap idea to see the mystery bird is cute, and my daughter was excited to see the birds emerge, but several of them would not close again without major contortions (for me, impossible for my daughter) and have gotten harder and harder to close with use, so now we just leave them all open. The information is great and the pictures are very well done, but the calls and pull flaps are very poor quality. I would not recommend that anyone buy this book."
3,Nice but...,"Nice study material but I was disappointed that it was only one sided. Since it is windy at times here, a two sided flag is much nicer."
1,Not well made and sides rip easy... on first use.,"I bought this cover after reading the positive comments. Well, it did not turned out that way for me.After slipping this cover on my new mattress, I realized that the sides ripped as I make it fit over the mattress.So if you have a thick mattress this will not work. Someone at Beautyrest should take engineering lessons. If you have a semi rigid structure such as this Tyvek looking fabric that the skirt if made of, should realized that when you add stitched all along you create weakness points like the scored cheese bag from the grocery store. If you pull on the side, the bags ripped open.That what happen to this cover. I am also reading that many other customers had the same problem.I had thrown the bag and the box away and when I got to UPS store, they wanted $35 for packing and shipping. Amazon was kind enough to let me throw it away and gave me full credit.Thanks Amazon"
1,Not worth it!!!,"I purchased this ""Mattress Protector"" because I had just gotten a new bed and it was way to firm. I took it out of the bag and as soon as I tried to put on my mattress the sides just ripped apart like paper, it did not even feel like material. This is the side that wraps around the mattress and gets tucked underneath. Instead of re-packing and returning it, I took my older mattress protector and put it on top of it so that I would have double the thickness to make the bed softer. When it comes time to wash it I will throw it out.. I would not reccomnend buying this. For a ""Simmons"" product this is a disgrace!!!!"
1,This is a horrible product,"The top of the mattress pad is great and feels wonderful to lie on, but the sides tore at two corners the first time I put it on the bed. If I hadn't already discarded the packaging, I'd return it, but now it's just too much trouble."
1,Looks good in the picture,"I went looking for a mattress pad with the elastic around the side because I loved the last one I had, it lasted for 4 years. Be careful the second time I washed it the elastic and netting came apart."
1,Terrible Quality,"Please, i beg you, do not buy this productThe top of the pad is decently soft, not amazing but ok. The real downfall of this product is the material that the sides are made out of. It is an extremely low quality paper-like fabric that rips anytime you look at it. After one month the sides of my pad were covered in duct tape to try and keep it together. Also, the elastic on the sides is so weak that every morning you will have to re-fit the pad onto the mattress due to it slipping off.After a few months of use this thing is going into the garbage.....if i dont decide to burn it first"
1,Fragile Edge,"The top of the mattress is nice with an easy to clean fabric and cushioning. However, the edge of the mattress pad that wraps around the mattress pad is fragile and made out of something that is similar to thick paper. In regular use it is not elastic enough to keep the pad centered on the pad so it slips around. This weekend I was making the bed and pulled on the bottom of the edge to tuck it, all of sudden there was a ripping sound an a 2'long rip along the stitch line. I suppose you get what you pay for."
3,Simmons Beauty Rest Mattress Pad,"I spent a little more money to get a mattress pad I thought would be a good one. The sides are just like the cheaper ones, a paper like substance that ripped as soon as I stretched it to put it over the mattress. Not very happy with the pad, but its still on the bed."
1,bad cover,I bought it in February. Within one month had multiples holes in the elastic sides. It had not even been washed
3,GREAT pad; sides fatally flawed,"We have two of the king sized pads; love the way they feel; really do make your mattress feel new, much more comfortable. But the sides are made of some sort of essentially disposable material that bears a lot of resemblance to elasticized handiwipes, and as you pull on the corner to put the mattress pad on, it is quite easy to make a fairly substantial hole in it with your thumb. Once you have a hole in it, it tends to tear along the elastic. Ours required lengthy repair; then I lined ours with a fitted sheet for reinforcement. They should make the sides out of actual woven fabric, such as (ahem) elasticized cotton sheeting that would hold up to lots of use, and lots of laundering."
5,Covers messy stain times,Covers messy stain times for bad nights with messy stain times. Very product fine with such stretch and good comfort able!
3,Disappointing,"I LOVED the padded part of the mattress protector, BUT the elastic sides that keep it on the mattress itself are starting to tear...already! It slips off easily & when you try and pull it over the mattress again, it tears/splits.....very disappointing. I have a couple of very expensive mattress protectors and this one seemed like it would be a really good one but I've had better luck with Walmart ones......I need to return it."
1,Had problems with product,"This product arrived with a tear on the seam between the top and side panels. I returned it and ordered a replacement, and it had the same problem. Returned that one also and got refund"
5,Added Life,This mattress pad was an excellent purchase. I was thinking of purchasing a new mattress but with this mattress pad I have extended the life of my mattress.
1,poor quality,product had adequate padding and loft for the pad part but felt like the jacquard material was plastic like. the elasticized part to keep pad in place was of poor quality. felt like paper and as soon as we tried to put the pad on the bed the elasticized part ripped. sent back for refund. went to kmart and bought a cannon pad cover for same price and is of better quality. this product should be taken off market
1,Poorly made,"The edges of this mattress pad rip at the slightest tug. This thing might as well have been made from paper. It would probably be stronger if it had been made from paper.In terms of comfort this thing is ok. I wouldn't write home about it but it does the job. However, I can't recommend this pad to anyone given the fact that it's so poorly manufactured."
3,Decent mattress pad.,"I just bought this mattress pad for my 4.5 year old mattress. It's definitely not earth shattering, but it does seem to make a slight difference. Doesn't overheat the bed like some covers have done. Haven't washed the pad yet so can't report on how it does on that end."
4,Good buy,"I needed to cheaply make an older mattress last a few more years, so I bought this hoping it would work. It looks like we have a brand new mattress and it helped make the mattress a little more comfortable. I'm really satisfied with it."
3,It's okay.,I had a Simmons pad from 10 years ago that turned a mattress into a whole new bed with it's padding. This one does not have the same effect. It's ok. Harder and bulkier to wash. But fine.
5,soft topper.,didn't shrink after washing and felt soft and thick like the first time I put it on the bed. The thickness was a surprise but very pleasant.
2,Weak textiles...,This mattress cover really impressed us when we opened it. It seemed to fit well when I made the bed up with it but the first time my wife tried (a month later) it tore. The side fabric with elastic tore around the bottom band. I cautioned her but we had poor feelings about the product. Just today we washed it and put it back on again and it tore on another corner. I've now decided that it's simply made poorly and the side material should be better for the cost (especially if people get conned into paying retail store prices). I'm going to appeal to the manufacturer tomorrow.
5,Fantastik.,Almost too beautiful to sleep on. Love the thick built in padding and expensive look. Plus it fits our king size mattress just right.
3,Simmons Beautyrest review,"This is a great mattress pad if you don't need much padding. Unfortunately, our mattress is as firm as a board, so while we saw an improvement; it wasn't enough. It fits very well on the bed, and we might order another one to layer on top of the one we have."
1,Very poor quality and I believe them to be fake,"Ordered from Amazon. This was the worst mattress cover I have ever seen. When putting on the bed, your fingers go right through the sides. I believe they are fake because it was a xerox copy of the original Simmons mattress pad adSimmons Beautyrest Mattress Makeover Jacquard Queen Mattress Padand I do not believe Simmons Beautyrest would make a product like that. I ordered because it was a good brand and price. Very disappointed and want a refund. It was a Christmas gift and my daughter threw away her old mattress cover so it has to stay on the bed until she gets a new one. Disappointed with Amazon with two of the 7-8 items ordered."
4,cover old mattress,I ordered this as mattress is pretty old and needed more support....cld be thicker but fit mattress sngugly and did add some thickness
3,very comfortable/just be careful drying,"I'm pleased with the fit of the California king size as well as the quality and comfort.Even low heat setting in dryer made is start to melt and I checked it after only a few minutes. You need to line dry when humidity permits or use fluff only dryer setting, only using low heat to warm it up for a very few minutes and then back to fluff setting. The heat lingers just long enough to dry without melting.Good, not incredible, but GOOD comfort. I will buy for other beds."
4,"Not exactly earth shattering, but still nice","This mattress pad is nice, but it's not quite as earth shattering as some of the other reviewers make it out to be. Yes, for the money it's a nice pad. It's soft and comfortable but ultimately it's not going to drastically change the feel of your mattress. This 'pad' is very thin and mainly just makes the mattress feel a little softer around your limbs but doesn't actually change the way the mattress feels on your pressures points (i.e. shoulder, hips, etc). So while this pad will give a little extra softness to the mattress, it's not going to fix your back pain or anything."
1,Poor quality mattress pad!,"Even though I wasn't expecting this $39 mattress pad to be as plush as a pillowtop mattress, I also didn't expect this item to be as thin as it is either. But the worst part of this mattress pad is how thin the underskirt is! While putting the mattress pad on for the very first time the underskirt actually ripped as if it were made of tissue paper. VERY poor quality. And as an earlier reviewer pointed out, the insert that comes inside the packaging with the mattress pad looks as if it was photocopied...not even the original. I've learned my lesson and from now on will only buy an item like this from a trusted department store. I will be returning this mattress pad ASAP!"
4,mattress pad,"This is our first experience with a mattress pad that is more than the old fashion cotton quilted type. It makes the sleeping surface a little softer and is pretty comfortable. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it holds body heat and feels warmer than our old mattress pad. This will be great in the winter. We are not uncomfortable, but prefer a cooler feel for the summer. After reading the other reviews prior to purchasing this and seeing other references to problems melting in the dryer, my plan is to line dry it when I wash it."
4,Very Nice!,"The cushioning is very nice. It provides an extra layer of comfort. I The fabric is nicely made and the polyfill is thick. Just be careful, your sheets still fit! I found that my bedsheets for thicker mattresses fit nicer than the ones I have for a standard mattress."
1,Ripped within a week.,I do not recommend buying this mattress pad. The sides are made with very flimsy material and it ripped within a matter of weeks. It was a total waste of money. I do not recommend anyone buying this mattress pad. I wish I didn't.
1,Piece of junk,As I was putting this pad on my mattress it ripped apart in my hands on each corner. The sides are made of paper. I could not believe it. It is a piece of junk. I returned it immediately for a full refund. Do not buy this. It is no wonder people cannot put it in the dryer.
2,Seemed okay until I put it on...,"the top is nice but the sides' fabric is terrible, horrible even. it rips and tears far too easily, even when being exceptionally careful. recommend finding a different one that is more elastic, and less plastic because this one won't last. on first install three corners tore in several places.."
2,poor quality,"A gift from UK to Sydney Australia. The side panel was flimsy...""like paper"" the daughter said...and ripped as she put the mattress pad on the bed."
2,ripped in 2 weeks,"this mattress pad looks nice and seems durable at first, but the ribbing and elastic around the sides ripped after just two washes and putting it back on the bed. the mattress pad was a bit stiff so we thought washing it a few times might help soften it. That did not work. disappointed that it already ripped."
3,Good but cheap sides,"I love the way this feels on the top. However as soon as I put it on, my fingernail went right through the paper thin side as I put it on. Since then, I have poked a finger through a few other spots. It's too bad, because the top is really nice."
2,Comfortable/ Cheap materials,"I always like to go with a trusted name when it comes to purchasing bedding. The cover in itself is quite comfortable and has made my very ""springy"" guest bed completely tolerable. However, the stitching that connects the side material to the actual mattress pad tore the minute I tried to put this product on my mattress (and the mattress is exceptionally thin). I was not rough with the product, nor did I purposely stretch it. Because I was having guests arrive that night- I chose to cut my losses and keep the mattress pad. However, I would not recommend this product for those with a little more time on their hands to get a better product."
1,nothing special.,"I really didnt see any extra bonus to putting this pad over my mattress. I still wake up sore, the pad seemed generally flat and unimpressive. I'm glad I didnt pay full price."
3,kinda lumpy,"The Simmons Beautyrest Mattress pad is lumpy and did not remake my bed. It does keep the mattress clean, though."
2,did not work as advertised,"Though this mattress pad is made well and stitched well, its thin and less sturdy material inside did not help support my bed. This mattress pad is not worth buying if you are looking for something that can maintain the firmness and support of your bed."
1,Do not buy this,I just received this mattress pad which after reading the reviews I thought I would b quite pleased with. Unfortunately I am not it is very very thin and did not help at all w/ my firm mattress. I am returning it ASAP and buying a feather bed. I would not recomended buying this.
1,Wasn't Impressed,I bought this mattress pad to replace our ole one and within a couple of weeks it started to tear. The seems are not strong at all and we have had this mattress pad for 6 months now and it is a complete shambles. I would never buy one from this company again. Don't waste your money.
1,I should have listened to the other reviews about the side panels.....,"This would be 5 stars ... except for the skirt / side panel! I bought/returned one after getting one corner ripped during a routine sheet change, then after a couple of months the replacement pad ripped as well.These other quotes state it well:""The side panel was flimsy"" ""like paper"" ""and ripped as she put the mattress pad on the bed. """""
2,DONT BUY- ripped as I was putting on,"I read the other reviews about the fingers going through the side but chose to ignore; I will be more gentle than those other consumers... WRONG ! It happened to me too.I have had (what I thought was the) same product on my bed for years, without any problems, purchased form Linen & Things. Loved it, it held up great, which is why I chose to ignore what the others reviewer wrote.DONT BUY THIS !"
2,cheap,Just put this cover on and it barely fit. netting is 2 in. on the bottom of the mattress. The netting tore in four places. I already threw out the packing so I won't send it back but when I change sheets again I will put the old on back on.The cover is thick but a few changes and it will be trash.
2,Disappointed,I was excited to get this product because my mattress is 10 years old. When I put it on the bed it tore three times. I would have expected the quality to have been better.The part that goes down from the top of the mattress pad is deep enough and I was shocked that it ripped so easily.I have purchased hundreds of items from Amazon and this is the only time I have been truely disappointed.
5,Simmons Beautyrest mattress pad,"This mattress pad did the trick. We had a cheap king size mattress, and had a 4 inch topper that really helped but seemed too soft. I thought before i decided to purchase a new mattress (since we only stay during winter months) I would just give this mattress pad a try. it worked just fine. It fit right over the existing mattress and also the topper. Works great...and solved my problem. very happy :)"
2,Mattress Topper with fragile paper sides,"I just got the mattress topper, I washed on cold and dried on cool and held up okay, I can't tell that it shrunk any. I went to put it on my mattress and the paper sides tore in several places when I put it on, I'm not sure why they can't make these things with a higher quality sides for the price I paid. Not sure what will happen when I wash it again with the side where it tore but regardless I'm not very happy that my brand new topper tore the first time I put it on. The top is okay, not really that much padding I don't think this thing will rejuvenate any mattress but might provide a little padding and a layer of protection for spills. Overall I don't recommend this product. Anyone know of any better toppers out there?"
2,The sides rip as you try to put it on.,"Be very careful and only handle it by the top if possible, when you try to stretch the sides down the mattress, they just rip along the elastic lines. We just got it today and it ripped in two places already. It totally fits perfectly and feels very pillowy and soft, but the sides are so cheaply made. They could easily fix this by using stronger fabric for the sides, it is basically tissue paper fabric with lines of elastic in it. The top is nice and beautiful."
3,Feels like a new bed (while it lasted)!,"The mattress pad looks beautiful and it went on the bed super easy and fit perfectly. We used it on top of our old mattress and our new memory foam mattress, and it is very comfortable. The picture doesn't even do it justice, it looks and feels luxurious.*Update* It went from 5 star to 3 star because it doesn't hold up well. The side material that you stretch over the bed is super thin and has torn in multiple areas. The top is still nice, but that doesn't do much good when the sides keep tearing. It also needs constant readjusting because it doesn't stay in place."
4,mattress pad,Large enough to fully cover the thickness of the mattress. Very good price for the quality.
1,Estoy decepcionada y enfadada,"Hice la compra del forro para mi colchón con mucha ilusión y esperanza por ser un producto de una marca reconocida en mi país, lamentablemente después de esperar 15 días y pagar una considerable suma por el transporte desde USA hasta Venezuela, la emoción conque lo recibí se desvaneció hoy cuando al montarlo en mi cama, la parte arruchadita que agarra el forro del colchón se rompió sólo con tocarlo en varias partes y por supuesto no pude montarlo.Tristemente dado la forma en que lo compré, no puedo solicitar cambio, pero escribo esto porque considero que el producto es malo, he perdido el dinero y quisiera saber si el fabricante de este producto tiene alguna forma de resarcir el daño.María Isabel Vernet MezaCaracas-Venezuela"
1,This looks like a knock off,"This product, sold by Amazon, looks like a knock off. The ""label"" in the packaging is a photocopy of a real label. I contacted Amazon and got a non-sense response. This item is reduced, because it is a knockoff. I now wonder what the filler is. Is it all new material, as the photocopy label says? Do not buy this product."
1,Poor quality product,A seam on the mattress pad ripped open when I was putting it on my mattress for the first time. That does not say a lot about the quality and long term durability of this product.
1,mattress cover,"When I received this item it had a big rip on the underside. It was big and bulky and a pain in the you know what to wrap back up, fit back into the box and return."
1,One-year to product failure,"As others have noted, the top heating elements quit working after just a year. OK if you like one-sided toast."
1,Buyer beware,I really liked this little toaster when I first got it. Tall enough to bake a chicken and small enough not to take up to much counter space. Within the year of purchace the thermostat went out on it but I didn't know it until I put a batch of cookie dough in it and walked out of the room. Needless to say the thing caught fire. What a scare.
3,a good size toaster oven,"I ordered this toaster oven for my school teacher's lounge. We are a small school with 20 staff members and everyone who has used it so far has complimented on how useful it is. We did have to watch the toast to make sure the level of browness is to our individual liking. When we first used it, none of us could figure out how to turn off the toaster to shorten the toasting cycle. We had to unplug it while the oven is ON!! I was ready to call Customers Service to complain. Then today I gave it one more try. I pulled the lever up with more force and it went back up to OFF position!! Bingo!! HOwever, I do have a suggestion. It would be more functional and efficient if the timer and toasting cycle work together like the model I have at home. Also the slanted top is just not functional either. I have an Oster too. But anyway, we are happy with it so far."
2,the same old story,"As at least two reviewers of the similar 6-slice oster toaster oven experienced, the top two burner elements gave out after about a year. That is at least THREE customers with the exact same complaint. This could not be a coincidence. W(ell, actually it could be a coincidence, but that is highly unlikely.) However, most toaster ovens in this price range last about 12-18 months, in my experience, having replaced many over the years. So, perhaps one should expect to pay about $30-40 per year for a toaster oven. If so, this model is fine."
1,Same problem,"I bought it from another store, turned it on to toast it did nothing. Changed setting to bake and soon after it started to smoke. I smell a recall!"
5,Oster 4-Slice Toaster Oven,I really am satified with the toaster oven. It a great toaster and if you bake cookies that timer is super. I am glad I brought the toaster oven through amazon. I first went to different stores to buy one but wasn't satisfy and I was getting exhausted from driving here and there so I decided to go on line and am very happy with the results.
5,Perfect work !,It's a shame not to discover this CD a little bit earlier.It sounds great.If you're a fan of bands like SAHARA or VENUS & MARS you have to pick up this item as soon as possible. I think it is the first and only CD from the band. Get your copy !
4,An Exceptional Value,"I am truly amazed at the technology and features bundled into this entry-level priced unit! Progessive scan DVD player with on-board Dolby Digital & DTS, Hi-Fi VCR, ability to play CD, CD-R, CD-RW including CD-R's containing MP3's and JPEG image files...for $159.00 or less!!! Set-up was straightforward, the remote logical, build quality OK althought the CD-DVD tray seems a bit flimsy. I've already tried it with DVD's, CD-audio, CD-R's containing MP3's or JPEG's, and it handled them all flawlessly. Navigation on-screen for the MP3 or JPEG CD-R's was intuitive and easy. Sound and picture quality is at least equivalent to my older, pricier Toshiba unit.Overall, not quite of state-of-the-art audiophile/videophile 'Dream Machine' caliber, but a versatile player and an amazing value. If you enjoy DVD's, audio CD's, & MP3/JPEG containing CD-R's don't hesitate to buy this unit."
2,Good remote but.......,"I am on my third one and it's going back too. The first had a problem with the door on the VCR. I couldn't get the tape out with out holding the door open with my hand. The second and third ones have blurry vision on VCR playback. I have stuck with this unit so long because I loved the remote. Well laid out, big buttons, easy to read. On the pluss side the DVD works fine. But that's it for me with this unit."
3,Not too impressed,"Because of a good price on-line, I bought this unit to replace a separate Panasonic DVD player and a Samsung VCR. I have been disappointed in the performance of the DVD player, which seems inferior to my entry-level progressive scan Panasonic. The player is also much fussier about which disks it will play. In addition, the remote is very difficult to navigate in the relatively dim environs of my home theater. I have since returned the Panasonic to home theater use and will use the JVC combo in the bedroom."
1,Returned Item,I purchased this DVD/VCR combo just two weeks ago and already the VCR section of the player does not work. Electronics are just not what they used to be. Returned the item and would not recommend to anyone.
4,Think Pad Mini-Dock,"This dock is your basic ""connections"" dock. It has the requisite USB ports, serial, parallel, key board, mouse and monitor connections but there is no space for an extra hard drive (could connect using the USB port). All in all it makes it easier to disconnect from a home office setup and take the ThinkPad on the road and is a good buy for the money."
3,Docking station for Lenovo T61,"The T61 (wide screen) laptop does not well attach to the docking station.So you need to be gentele on the whole thing once it's in the docking station. Mechanically speaking - they could have done a much better job.I needed the docking station to get RS232 and LPT ports, that the T61on its own lacks. As such this is really really not cost effective solution. The docking station is way too expensive in my opinion and not just for my needs.So if you are considering this product just for I/O extentions, I would suggest a much cheaper solution in the form of- LPT: PCMCIA card- RS232: USB-Serial cable."
2,could be better,"This docking station will lock up your laptop if you loose power. We purchased 20+ of these for company laptops and every one exhibited the same behavior. We placed a call to Lenovo and they said it is working as designed. Tell that to an engineering who lost an hour or two of work.If you don't need DVI, and can live without the un-docking feature or built-in sound port, I would go with the standard model as it does not do this. If you do purchase this, I would recommend a power supply."
5,Lenovo ThinkPad Advanced Mini-Dock Port Replicator,"This mini-dock is a huge improvement over the last mini-dock for my R-52. It's easier to put on than the older Lenovo docks. It has VGA, an audio output, and 6 USB cables. It also fixes some problems with the old docks. With the old docks if you put your computer to sleep and took it off the dock, my computer would wig out. This dock is really smooth and easy to take on and off the dock with no problems. I have a hard disk, a printer, an ipod, a windows phone, keyboard, mouse, and monitor connected to my dock. Great to not have to connect those in and out everytime I go to my office. Highly recommmended."
4,Another good Lenovo product,Makes life a little easier in the office. Good for office or home no need for a desktop.
2,Power Supply Delivered was not compatible with the Dock that was delivered.,"The power supply that came with the dock was 170Watt power supply which is compatible with the Thinkpad that I have, however it would not plug into the dock because the power plugs were different. The dock works with a lower wattage power supply which I just happen to have, but the Thinkpad still runs on battery power. Not really what I was looking for from a dock.The supplier (eDealer) that I have been dealing with has been GREAT through this whole thing and I would give them 5 Stars!"
4,Lenova T61 Thinkpad laptop docking station cum port replicator,"Works very well as expected. If I have to list an additional 'nice to have' feature in the docking station, it will be an IEEE 1394 port (used for connecting firewire cable to camcorders). This will specifically benefit Lenova T61 laptops that do not have a built-in IEEE 1394 port. Nevertheless the docking station is good value for money."
3,mildly amused,"cinematography of poetic images is fairly good. The plot, however, is based on unreality and confusion about realtiy and may not interest the more concretely based. Definitly not a thriller, but nice to watch."
2,Don't buy the Century Media version!!!!,"An excellent release .... just don't buy this version. The Century Media release with the Bonus Tracks contains audio that appears to have gone through some kind of lossy audio encoding process (i.e. encoded to MP3 then back to PCM) before being sent to the manufacturing plant.Avoid this one, check out the other versions and make sure you receive the full audio spectrum that you paid for."
1,Not a good follow-up,"I think that Avantasia part 1 is one of the best power metal albums of the new century. That is exactly why I expected a lot from the part 2 of the sequel especially remembering how Helloween came up with 'Keeper' part 2. And what do we have this time around?Well, I did not like it. Actually, the first song was pretty good that reminded me of part 1 in several places. But then...Even Kiske's presence did not help since the songs were so weak, maybe with an exception of the slower track sung by Bob Catley. I gave this album a few extra spins, but it didn't grow on me.Instead, you should safely go with 'Avantasia part 1' that represents what true power metal is all about."
1,Is this It?...,"This must have been one of the most awaited metal albums of all times because all of the musicians who worked in this project , the 1st part of Avantasia was so rich in the lyrics and the music and all ,it really created an amazing atmosphere for the listener , it was a whole new concept in metal , i at least was expecting Part 2 to be way better than what it is but it is just an average(or even below the average!)power metal album. There's nothing special about it , nothing new to metal . Bad Bad Tobias Sammet .....Hail Metal Opera Part 1 ....Dont buy Part 2 , buy something else ."
1,This is The funniest Cd i've ever heard,"This album is so amazingly bad it becomes good. It is the single funniest thing i have ever heard. Anyone who takes this cd seriously should be hit with a brick. Any one who sees merit in the lyrics ""Into the light Into the chalice of agony welcome to avantasia"" should be flayed to within an inch of there lives. Still i think every human being on the planet should own this cd."
2,Delayed but still in a hurry?,"Delayed by several months Tobias Sammett finally released his awaited follow-up to the success Avantasia Pt 1. However it is not fulfilling the expectations, rather it seems to have been completed in a hurry and the story and the booklet brings no satisfaction. Avantasia Pt 1 was (although written in mediocre english) actually a true ""opera"" with a short introduction to the tale of Avantasia. Pt 2 ends this tale with the conclusion ""The full detailed story is far too long and because it would be beyond the scope of this booklet we tried to concentrate on the basic pillar"" (i.e. = well, I don't have time to finalise it - use your own imagination) and the songs are more symbolic than part of a greater story.However, even Avantasia Pt 2 has some highlights and upon listening through the CD several times you end up thinking some of the songs are quite OK. This helps up the rating from pure junk."
3,not as good,if you own the first metal opera this might be a dissapointment. dont get me wrong i liked it but it does not have the power of the first one. the songs are more complex but that does not make a good disc. still the story keeps going and if you make the purchase you will not be to upset.
4,Part 2 Of The Avantasia Project,"I gotta admit this release is a slight let down after the first Metal Opera which was incredible. Here again you have Bombasic Power Metal played by several different all star musicians in the rock/metal world with main man Tobias Sammett of the Power Metal band Edguy at the helm.This second release starts off in the best of possible ways with the spellbinding epic ""The Seven Angels"". The rest of the album is filled with songs that are good but not as good as the songs on the first Metal Opera release. Overall the first Metal Opera is a lot stronger than this one but due to the awe inspiring strength of the long opening track ""The Seven Angels"" no less than 4 stars can be given here."
2,What a dissapointment....,It's a shame that Sammet decided to take this route when making a follow up to the absolutely brilliant first album. I had such high expectations and yet this weak follow-up failed to meet them on even the lowest of levels. This album gives so much truth to the idea that sequels can never quite live up to the live of the first. I gave this several listens to see if I could get to enjoy this cd and it just didn't happen. Thank god I didn't pay for it.
3,Wrapping up loose ends...,"This doesn't come across so much as a standalone work as a wrapping up of the loose ends left over from the awesome first Avantasia album. Still, it's entertaining enough. The main drawback for me is that the vocals seem a little weak and drowned out in this production, and you often have to really strain to hear what lead vocalist/mastermind Tobias Sammet is saying. Even the incredibly powerful voice of German metal legend Michael Kiske has trouble punching through to the surface during his brief appearances.Can't really down the record, though. ""Chalice of Agony"" and ""Memory"" stand out as great rockers, along with a trimmed down single version of the epic title track from the first ""Avantasia"". To sum it up, not as awe inspiring as the first installment, but stil worth a listen."
3,Leather Gloves,"For the price, I could not have chosen a better pair of gloves. I purchased it for my hubby, and he says it's comfortable. Delivery time was exceptional. I was worried I would not get it because of the christmas rush, and I was going back to Jamaica."
5,Fits and breathes well,"Boyfriend also wanted a pair of gloves for driving in the high humidity/heat climate, and after a few reviews he decided on these, though he doesn't drive a motorcycle. He said they were pretty true to size and, like any leather glove, will start out tight and stretch to the appropriate fit after breaking them in. He said they were surprisingly comfortable and the fit was surprisingly spot on after breaking them in. The gel pads apparently aren't too thick, and work well on the palm. For the price, these gloves are fantastic."
5,Got what I wanted!,"'Net-surfing Amazon one night I spied these fingerless light-weight motorcycle gloves and thought they'd be great for summer cruising ... the full leather gloves are HOT! So I ordered them and they arrived in just a couple of days and were precisely as advertised, fit perfectly, and are much more comfortable in the brutal summer heat, plus the gel palms dampen some of the vibes transmitted through the handlebars. Excellent product for the rock-bottom price. I was also fortunate because there were no physical failures like one reviewer had with the glove's stitching, gel or otherwise. I'll get several seasons out of these gloves, I'm sure. I've bought several products from Jafrum, from bike luggage to clothing, and have yet to be dissatisfied with anything they sell."
3,Good enough.,"The delivery and the package were very good. The product is acceptable, but on first use, the gel began to slip out of pockets. So I had to re-enter with a small screwdriver and sew by hand. I recommend checking the inside of the gloves before use. By the way, the rest is fine."
2,Not fascinating,"This wasn't a bad book, per se, just a boring one. The recipes were pretty uninspired, in my opinion, and didn't really add anything I couldn't have found for free online. I returned this...but I'm hanging on toPerfect Scoop: Ice Creams, Sorbets, Granitas, and Sweet Accompanimentsfor dear life. THIS is a fantastic, inventive and hugely informative book."
3,Description not accurate,"The description says the deflector mounts in-channel, but that's not the case. This product actually mounts to the outside of the rubber window surround with adhesive tape."
2,Pawprints Keepsake,"The final finished product looked great. However, it was a struggle getting there.The first problem was the size of the mat openings. The smaller opening was 3 1/2 x 5 1/2 so standard photograph sizes didn't fit proportionally. The larger opening was 4 3/8 x 6 1/4 which also didn't fit any standard size photos proportionally. I finally gave up trying to make everything fit and had a new mat cut at the local framing shop.The second issue was when assembling all the pieces black specs from the frame kept getting in between the glass and the mat. I had to sand the inside of the frame and then damp wipe the wood to resolve the issue.As I said, the final product looked great, but for the price of the kit, it should have been much easier to assemble and I shouldn't have had to spend as much time as I did."
3,Cute Frame...Clay was Dried Up,"This frame is a cute idea, but when we got it, the clay was so dried and hard that we couldn't press hard enough to get our puppy's paw imprinted. I had to go to Michael's and buy another type of clay."
1,terrible,The Mold stuck to my dogs paw. What a hassle to get off his paws and fur. Would not recommend this.
3,Not bad for pre-teen.,"Very easy read. Im a mom & I find this would be suitable for young readers of perhaps 11 yrs old. Sense of adventure, though somewhat anticlimactic. Seemed Brit perspective of Americn Old West."
2,1000 plus pages......who has time to get into this book???,"The dialect is difficult to move through. Cumbersome. Granddaughter liked it. Definitely not a ""page turner"". Waste of my time; only read 2 chapters......don't remember."
5,Bearing,I have not used this yet but loking at this I agree with others about it being noisy. Just lube it before assembly and you will be OK. I would buy this again. It was delivered faster than expected.
4,solid,"This bearing worked well for the theatrical use I put it to, supporting opera singers without complaint.The bearings are a little noisy, I should have applied heavy grease before installing it"
5,Mapping the Atari,"When I read about the Microsoft Windows Registry fiie, it reminds me of ""Mapping the Atari"". They sound similar. Makes me that much more familiar with Windows. (I am a Mac man(!))"
3,The tabs that hold the lid on the bowl eventually warp...,"The tabs on the side of the bowl that hold the lid on to the bowl have all eventually warped over time in the dishwasher. Product claims to be dishwasher safe, but that has not been my experience."
2,Not for tweens or young teens.,"This book is good for older teens but gives more information than tweens and younger teens need or want to know. It presents itself as an introduction to puberty but some of the information about sex is inappropriate for younger girls and should wait until they are past puberty. For a fun, positive, far less scary handbook to puberty, ""The Care and Keeping of You"" from the American Girl Library is a much better choice for tweens and young teens. ""The Feelings Book"" and ""Friends: Making and Keeping Them"" are very helpful and thoughtful books for girls."
5,Perfect for my pre-teen daughter,"A friend recommended ""The Care and Keeping of You"" - the American Girl book (which is good) and then I found this book on Amazon. I like it because it is Christian and filled with Biblical references while still providing helpful and detailed (age appropriate) information about growing up into a woman. It is very clear but very well written and not too blunt."
4,Great for beginning discussions,"I bought this book for my daughter who is 11-1/2. We have always had very open, honest dialogue about everything and this is a great book for continuing that dialogue. She and I cuddle on the couch and read the chapters together, then we discuss the journaling part and she goes to her room, sits and writes, and prays over the parts that it says to do. It's great.My only concern with the book is that sometimes it mentions ""if your mother doesn't agree with this, that's okay, you need to respect her decision, maybe approach it with her later"". It give the feel to me of 'your mom is wrong, but bring it up later.' I'm not crazy about that, but otherwise it's a great book. I will likely check into getting the others in this series."
5,the body book,This book was great!! Very age appropriate. My daughter and I went through it together and it answered a lot of questions for both of us.
2,Jabra Ear Gel Product review,"The initial fit eliminates sound, but with the lack air circulation into the ear the ear gel looses its ability to stay sealed within a few minutes, thereby not staying in its comfortable position."
1,"""Sorry we forgot to mention...""","Simple, not too bad, really, but...External mic, yes! Bought it, spent a night filming old super 8(mm) archive film adding comments, only to find out afterwards there was no sound, because the external mic:1. must be a condenser mic2. needs its own power supply3. can't exceed 3 meters.Called Canon customer support (around 6:50 on 8/13), and I was told:1. those kinds of mics are common and inexpensive (yet, somehow Radioshack doesn't carry any and laughed at me, Wal-Mart scratched their head and wondered, etc.)2. well, we didn't really mislead you--even though we ""forgot"" to mention it in the specs (like: ""oh, I told you the car runs on gasoline--I just forgot to mention it's a specially mixed diesel... sorry!"")3. it was in the manual so it's your own dumb fault, sorry4. I'm not going to do anything, sorry you don't ever want to choose Canon again.Thanks, guys! :( Sony, I never should have left you!!"
3,Be sure your computer has firewire capability,My daughter and I purchased this camera together. I was going to use it in my classroom and she was going to use it to make movies (she is 13). She saved up all summer for it and we researched it out as being a good buy. The big problem we have is we can't connect to our computer. Your computer must be firewire compatible and ours (a 3 year old Dell) is not. To make it compatible will cost at least 70 dollars and that doesn't include the labor if we have to get someone to install the firewire card (it looks tricky to me) and Dell's website is very confusing to try to find out if we can cimply add the firewire card. I read somewhere that many Dell computers come w/o firewire capability. So be careful!
2,"Very Good Pic, Terrible Motor Noise","Lots of features on this cam and a very good picture, but the motor noise is in my opinion, unbearable. I can not see having to use an external mike at all times, therefore it must go!"
1,"cheap, bad, camcorder!","I have been dealing with canon for over 2 years with a problem this model has. I can not upload from camcorder to computer to convert my movies to DVD. I am spending a fortune in 8MM tapes, because I can't reuse them- they cost $5.00 each. I have sent my camcorder back to Canon 4 times! They lost my first camera and replaced it with a refurbished one-that had no battery with it. Unusable to me. Then they replaced that with a new camera, after months of writing letters- and the new one had the same problem! Sent it to repair, came back 'fixed'. Not. I am beyond frustrated and I am going to purchase a Panasonic today. The cost of shipping to and from repair shop, and the cost of all the tapes has FAR EXCEEDED what I paid for the camcorder. And YES, it is noisy to operate.I hate it."
4,A great little camcorder,"I only had an old large VHS camcorder from the 90s, so I had never held or used the new compact kind. I didn't need a real expensive camcorder, but wanted digital technology. I chose this Canon product because I trust Canon. I have 2 Canon printers that I like very much. I am still working on filming my first full miniDV tape, so I haven't watched it on the TV screen yet, but when I review what I filmed it looks very good. I'm real pleased with it so far. Also, the zoom is awesome. Linda"
2,Cheap but noisy!,"I have read all the product reviews prior to buying this camera.I chose to believe that reviewers were (perhaps) exagerating in their comments about noise levels. How noisy could a camcorder be?Well, I was wrong! IT IS NOISY! READ OTHER REVIEWS and know that they ARE CREDIBLE!Looking back I would rather spend more money on a better quality product."
2,"Good video, horrible audio noise","I loved the small size, great price but after testing it out for a bit, the noise from the motor was unacceptable and I returned the device. That kind of background noise is unacceptable and could ruin a lot of home videos. I would look elsewhere."
2,Is it really a Canon?,"Just purchased the ZR800 because I needed a DV camcorder with Mic input. This may be the cheapest feeling camera I have ever owned. The motor noise on the tape is unbelievable. Granted it is only $210 but even at that price I doubt the value. Canon makes such wonderful cameras, I can't believe that this is in their line."
1,I sent this one back,"I had an older Canon camcorder that I was very happy with, so I decided to get this new one. I ended up shipping it back because the tape noise was so loud. I even tried the same model at Best Buy to make sure it wasn't just a defective camera. But compared to a similar Sony model, the Canon was noticeably louder while operating. Way to loud for shooting anything resembling quiet conditions."
3,Used this brand before,I used a camcorder like this before & was very impressed with the quality of video it took. I bought this used & have not enjoyed the video quality as much. I'm not sure if it is lighting issues or if the camera had been dropped.....I will probably go the new route the next time.
2,Cam Corder,The MiniDV Camcorder worked fine for taping but the firewire port did not work and it had to be returned. The vendor was very helpful and refunded my money promptly.
4,good for the price,"good for the money. nice picture good features cons: pc needs firewire port, the camera picks up the noise of the motor when filming in low volume situations"
2,What's that noise in the background? The motor?!,"My wife and I were happy to get this on sale. She was happy it fit well in her hands and it is light. Well, I read a couple reviews afterword where people complained about motor noise. I thought how bad could it be...it's bad. Not only is it louder than my 5 year old Sony Hi8, but it sooo totally noticable during playback that it seriously ruins the moment. Especially if that moment is of a quiet sleeping infant or some other special moment that you don't want to hear a whiny motor... Can't wait to return this tonight. Also, I read that others just add a microphone...yeah I don't think so. I'll have to have a second look at Sony or Panasonic."
2,Boring,"One of the most boring, slapped together videos ever made. Read the books. They're 10x better."
3,kareoke for fans of Eros' music,"This cd is good if you want to sing along to some of Eros Ramazzotti's songs with the orchestra in the background for your own entertainment or others'. Another plus is that the insert includes all the lyrics in Spanish (although, alas! there is no English translation). So you have the lyrics on the insert to read while you sing. If you know a little Spanish--or have studied it in college (like I have)--you can brush up on your Spanish by translating the lyrics into English. So you can enjoy the songs alot better when you get a better idea what they'r all about. But this is really another reason, as a fan of Eros, I like his music: he not only has good tunes, but meaningful words to go with them. And his lyrics say alot more (I think ) than many songs in English today, which are just crude, vulgar and lacking in poetry."
3,Very sweet,"I like the crunchy-ness of the middle, but it doesn't have a great flavor, basically just a very sweet taste without much substance. The chocolate around it is pretty sweet too. If you like really sweet candy and crunchy-ness then go ahead and get them, but there are much better chocolates out there."
3,Shorted,Was shorted by one bar. It was supposed to be a six pack of bars but only five were in the ziplock bag they came in. Hopeing they correct this problem.
3,Decent Candy,Wanted to try something new so I bought these. Reminded me of a thicker Heath Bar. Okay for something new but not my taste. Good shipping on product from seller.
3,cool to try a new bar but wouldnt buy if i saw it in a store,"import, had to try, did and it was alright. sweet, and flakey. going to try the other cadbury bars, guessing this one wouldnt be my favorite"
3,eh...,Tried these for the first time through this Amazon order. Not sure if this is normal but to me it kind of had a stale after taste. Not something I would get again.
1,"From Pakistan, not England","Imagine ordering chocolate that is supposed to be from England and receiving chocolate wrapped in paper with Pakistani language(Urdu)all over it. Yes, it contained English translation but I didn't order candy from Pakistan. I ordered candy from England thru Trade Concepts. The candy is rather stale and old and tasted like cheap milk chocolate. If this indeed comes from England, why do the wrappers indicate they are from Pakistan?I also ordered the ""Flake"" These too are from Pakistan. The center is not flaky or crunchy or crumbly but rather stale and old.Because of the Urdo language all over the wrappers, I can only assume that perhaps Trade Concepts imports from England, removes the wrapper and then rewraps them in their own wrappers? I'm sure the FDA would be interested in this practice.This review refers to the seller Trade Concepts"
4,YUMMMM!!!,What else is there to say other than YUMMM!!! Melts in your mouth! Arrived quickly and in great shape. Packaging was great
5,TASTES DELICIOUS!!,"This candy became a favorite of mine the most I ordered it. It tastes amazing and as soon as I finished them, I couldn't help but buy more!"
1,"Great Product, Don't Buy Here","I've been using this product for years and love it. I bought it here in ""bulk"" to save some money, but the pomade in every jar I received has a strange and very unpleasant smell that I've never experienced before. Great pomade, buy it somewhere else."
2,blah..,i bought this product because it had some really good reviews but i didn't like the way it made my hair look. i looked like i used crisco to style my hair. not worth it imo.
4,Mad Men,This pomade is good for a more casual outing like indoor dinner or etc but it won't hold for more strenuous activities such as cycling or going to the beach (due to the sea breeze)
5,Great product at a great price,"I have been using this product for at least for a few years and I love it!! I love the way it styles my hair and the way it looks with this product. For my hair, this product is far superior than any of the over the counter styling gels.What I did not like was the price of $16.00 at my local drug store. I cringed every time I bought it, but I liked the results enough to where I did buy it begrudgingly.Then I came across a discount toiletry store at a local flea market where the product was priced at $11.00. The only problem was that you had to catch them when the shipment first came in and buy everything they had before they sold out.Then I came across Amazon.com with their auto shipping and a price tag of less than 10.00 and it's delivered to my door. I am a customer for life!! Keep the pomade coming!!"
4,Just a dab will do ya!,"American Crew pomade, thick gel to put in your hair to thicken it up. It works, easy to work with. Good stuff."
5,"Mary, Queen of Scots, and the Murder of Lord Darnley","I always enjoy Alison Weir's books. Mary, Queen of Scots, and the Murder of Lord Darnley is a very good read. I wanted this one especially because I just got back from Scotland where I heard so much about the Queen."
2,Forget the Casket Letters.,"It doesn't matter if they were forgeries, Mary's behavior is damning enough. In an extraordinary about face she suddenly reconciles with the husband she wants to be rid of, carries him off not to an established royal residence but a half ruinous house in Edinburgh and then conveniently goes to a wedding the night said house is blown sky high! When you throw in the fact she was visibly pregnant when she surrendered at Carberry Hill - a mere two months after her supposed 'rape' by Bothwell - it becomes rather difficult to defend her innocence."
3,OK,When i brought this book i was hoping that i would come away with a new and clear understanding unfortunitly i was not 100 per cant satisfied.This book moves along at a very brisk pace this is justified i suppose by the fact that the early life and other events that exclude the Darnly affair are not supposed to be the highlight of the story.Alison weir does not make it very clear who was most likely to be guilty of the crime i suggest this book for someone who enjoys deciphering but if you just like to have a casual read then this is not the book for you.I was not too disapointed for i was able to get it new for 5 dollars pheraps for this price i may say it was a good buy but if you are paying above 8 dollars then i would not bother.My review may sound critical but i merely would not like others to be dissapointed and other alison weir books such as the wives of henry the 8th or the life of elizabeth the first are more desirable
4,A true admirer of Mary. Weir could have had a sturdier case.,"I have read countless books on Mary I, and I truly believe her to be an intelligent woman attacked by vicious Scottish noble society VS her Renaissance upbringing in France. Not to mention her being a Catholic VS her Protestant nobles. This was a hard game at that point barely won by anyone. Catherine De Medici, one of the most intelligent stateswomen of the entire era could barely manage her own wars of religion, why should young Mary be held so much more accountable? I will say that the times were hard, and harder if you were female, and even harder further still in regards to religion. Mary did her best with what she was given, and I would dare any male or female still to do any better in the given circumstance. I also challenge the reviewer who said she was regarded as unintelligent, because she certainly was not. She was regarded as quite witty and intelligent, though she was no intellectual like Elizabeth."
2,Hoped for more balance,"I was disappointed in the book, because I hoped for a more balanced, objective look at the murder of Darnley, and Mary's degree of involvement. I agree with the reviewer who said the book needed better editing. Too much time was devoted to repetitious and indignant refutation of George Buchanan's ludicrous allegations about Mary, and Ms. Weir's point of view was driven home too vehemently. The research was meticulous, to the point of ponderous. Near the end of the book, I found myself thinking ""Off with her head!"" and skipping chunks of pages to reach the conclusion, which, by that time, I found rather satisfying."
3,A little dry,"This is the only translation of the Dhammapada I own. I found the text very dry and not particularly inspiring, although pretty much what one might expect of a translation by an 80-something year old Sri Lankan monk. The book is a very handy size to carry around in my pocket."
5,Start with the wings,Barbecued Wings Charlotte Style (p. 44) makes this book worth its fantastic Amazon price. Quadrupled the recipe and served the wings to a backyard party of 75 during the 2006 Sharpie 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway. Look forward to preparing more of Mario's tailgating delights.
2,Not much here,almost seems like it was written as part of some contract obligation. seems most of these recipes can be found on the internet.
5,I'm not a NASCAR fan but I love this cookbook!,"... and just in time for grilling season too. The recipe for Mario's Kick-ass Barbecue Sauce (p.127) alone is worth the price of admission along with his insight into the subculture existence surrounding NASCAR fans. This book also contains one of the better Alabama White BBQ Sauce (p.41) recipes I've come across. Plenty of exceptional photos to support his recipes and NASCAR activities, though I wish each photo came with a caption to identify the people, time, and race/place. This is a fun grilling cookbook to share with friends and I have to admit that I now view NASCAR races (with my husband) in a much different light."
5,THE ONLY GRILL BOOK YOU'LL NEED THIS SUMMER,"Who needs 400 pages of recipes for the grill? Mario distills it down to the essentials - everything you need for a summer over the flames -- plus many recipes you haven't thought of yet. This is food that's always simple, and always a little better for the Batali spin."
4,Loved the cookbook -,Had alot of fun recipes and pictures. They only change I would make is to have the pictureslabeled.
5,This book changed my life.,"In short, you will forget about any ethnic prejudices that you may have (if you think you don't have them, you will still discover them within yourself while reading this book, and then you will forget about them too). You will see human societies and individuals with a new set of eyes, be it your neighbors or remote historical figures.Gumilev's theory is as great a discovery in the world of human sciences as Mendeleyev's table of elements was in the world of chemistry. And, like the table of elements, it also helps to finally organize seemingly unrelated facts of life into one powerful tool, etc., etc... Sorry, gotta go and revise my prejudices towards the Huns, Germans, Turks, Talking Taco Dogs, Seinfeld and Puerto Ricans..."
5,"Wonderful, informative book on growing gourds.","Last year it was a jungle in my garden,the gourd plants had taken over and I was at a loss as to what to do. This book has helped me 100% on my cultivation of gourds. It covers trellising, pruning, common pests and problems. A great book for the novice or seasoned gardener who might need a reminder of a few things (like me)."
4,A small criticism,"It is a great book on gourds, and gourd growing, no doubt. More in depth than expected. Not dumbed down at all. (Which is rather refreshing in a modern gardening book.) My only critique is that she's rather heavy handed in the promotion of chemical pesticides. Some organic & non chemical practises are briefly mentioned, but otherwise it's grab & spray Sevin (or some other wide spectrum insecticide) over & over. Considering that this was published in 2001 and not 1965, that was disappointing to see."
5,Everything You Need To Know About Gourds,"If you want to grow gourds, you need this book. I have had great luck with keeping my gourds under control, while still getting the most gourds off of my vines. I use gourds in my art, and this book gave me great ideas for how to get my gourds to maintain the correct shapes that I need."
3,A Wonder Clinker?,"No but as a Soundtrack ""The Woman In Red"" is the first Wonderalbum I've heard in a while to contain some filler.Aside from therather vapid hit ""I Just Called To Say I Love You"",the better""Love Light In Flight"" and the synth-funk of the tital song and""Don't Drive Drunk"" Wonder shares the space with Dionne Warwickand brief cocktail instrumentals by Ben Bridges.Better to getWonders four songs here from a friend and dub them off becauseI doubt even completists will find the rest of interest."
3,"Not Exactly ""Wonder""-ful","This CD is clearly not Stevie Wonder's best effort! I guess he was running out of ideas, or else he just wanted to create an album for the current generation of ""Listen-while-you-drive"" listeners. ""I Just Called to Say I Love You"" might just be the most overrated song he has ever written. As far as soundtrack album is concerned, one for the movie ""Jungle Fever"" is much better."
1,SUCKSS,"this book is worthless, all it does is fall apart. DO NOT BUY! It was not worth the dollars I paid for it! Honestly Barbara..... get a better publishing company. ALLYN AND BACON YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED"
5,Memorable DVD for an incredible tour!,"As an actual attendee of this concert in Chicago, the DVD surpassed my expectations. I originally saw it on the big screen at Regal Theaters in April. It took me back to the precise time, place and feeling of that concert. The setlist is fantastic, the performances incredible and this DVD should open the doors for new fans who originally cast-off Hanson as a one-hit wonder back in 1997. This DVD is the one to buy! I know I will."
5,What a stupendously great band!,"DVD for the people who could not see it in theaters. It would have been better if CDs came with the DVD. Hanson is trying to spend less. But at least it's a 'rhino' DVD. That's a start. Also, the most annoying Hanson songs are left off, and that's the end!"
1,Inferior product,"These socks are supposed to fit adults,if you have a child size foot then they might fit.Worse than the product not fitting,trying to return it is a nightmare.I emailed the compant 2 days after receiving the socks,stating they didn't fit and I like to return them.They said am i sure I wanted to return them?I assured them I didn't have any use for socks that don't fit and would like a refund.They agreed.Their policy is after 30 days forget it,I contacted them asking for an address so I can return the socks,It's been well over 30 days I'm still waiting for an address and a refund.Would I reccomend this company or their product to anyone,Never.I would expect Amazon to hold them accountable,it looks as though thats wishful thinking.Sharon Funk"
1,Well this is sad,"After only wearing them twice, the front of the toes began to split. Now, maybe 4-5 wears in, my toes poke out.Need to be sewn up and fixed.comfy at first, but fall apart :C"
5,Good socks,"Received the sox quickly. They seem to be good so far? A bit thin so if you need a thicker sox these are not them...more like a dress sock, well made though."
4,great book,"i love the sweet valley university series. not as much as i love sweet valley high but it's still cool. i know jessca loses her virginity in this book, but in a lot of sweet valley high books it makes it sound kind of like she has sex then (with bruce patman in playing with fire and that creepy jonathon guy in kiss of a killer and a few others i could mention) but anyway it was a really good book."
1,Not very natural at all,I bought this CD thinking it would be relaxing with its natural sounds but it has a lot of new age type music in it. The music overrides the few sounds of rain/water etc. I don't find this CD relaxing in the least bit and am very disappointed with it. If you are looking for a relaxing CD with sounds of nature this is not it!
3,not that bad,nelly and kelly rowland make a good duet right here and hope patti labelle got her props.
4,Totally Authentic Cuban Beat,"Having seen Habana All Stars in person, I purchased this CD while still in Cuba but was only able to listen to it once back at home. Often one is disappointed with this sort of thing; a CD can never replicate the live version. True, this group was amazing in person - suave, polished and the music is thoroughly Cuban (went very well with a Mojito or two). Nevertheless, this CD is about as close as you can get to a live performance of the group - truly spirited, and totally authentic it really does conjure up images of their show. They really sing and play from the soul."
5,Good Aid To Help You Study The Night Sky,"As with pretty much all National Audubon Field guides, this one is a good, solid reference guide. I'm looking forward to using it this summer on nice, clear nights. The guide is easy to understand, and the layout and pictures make it very easy to know where to look, and what to look for. If you want a good, all-around guide to help you locate and learn about the wonderful night sky, this guide should do the trick."
3,Compressor was a match but the belt pulley was to narrow!,Compressor was a match but the belt pulley was to narrow! The specs should have the pulley width on the information before you buy.
4,1400 Gardens with complete information,"I bought this book used from Amazon. Wow. If you are looking for a guidebook for gardens in the UK this is it. NOT a picture book. Organized for easy use. Maps for each county keyed to property descriptions. Good descriptions with hours, entrance fees and features for each garden. 648 Wonderful pages. If you LOVE gardens and want to know where to go you won't be sorry with this book."
4,great series of books,"the book i got wasnt the book i ordered but it was still ok. if it would have been the one i wanted it is a great book, great stories, i grew up on this childcraft series and they teach you so much, a lot of it out of date for today but its interesting to learn about the past."
4,Bob Mackie knows what he's doing,"I have always liked Bob Makie...about 8 - 10 years ago he had a cologne that I LOVED....He stopped making it, although I'll never know why, but even though I can't remember the name, I'm sure Id recognize it if I heard it again...."
1,No buy,"My wife bought this watch for my birthday from Costco and i liked it initially. After couple months, the strap just broke on its own. And there was no repair for the strap. Finally i had to have a local repair expert drill additional pin hole to fix it. Then the battery died , which I thought would be an easy thing to repair, but neither Costco, Sears nor Macy's was able to replace the battery for this model. Yes... that was a big surprise for me. Since then , I stopped using it, I would like to find a new strap and have battery replaced to use it, but just can't find any place who can do it."
4,Mike's Birthday Present,"I, and more importantly, my son, Mike, were very impressed with the structure and look of the watch. I had looked for it in a blue background, but the black is very smart looking. He has received many compliments on his new watch, and it goes with everything!"
3,Watch out for condensation,"I really like the look and fit. I think it is a simple and elegant piece. It keeps time fine. I have a little problem with the calendar, I usually adjust it every month. I should read the instructions. The real problem is water getting in. Don't shower in it, don't do dishes, don't wash your hands. It is really bad."
1,Transsexuality Enquirer,"After reading this book I just can't figure out how anyone in their right minds would try to pass this off as anything other than tabloid trash. It's time for a little reality check. There is NO scientific research here. NONE. These wacko theories of gay male transsexuals and auto-gyno-whateveria are merely stray (some might say sordid) fantasies from the minds of pseudo-academics who publish in low-impact journals that only make it to print because they are edited by their friends. Don't hold your breath and expect to be reading any of this stuff in ""Science"" or ""Nature"" anytime soon. Best inspect the check-out lanes at your nearest 7-11 instead."
1,Horrible fiction,"I only read part of the book and I found it totally fictional and untrue in all aspects. The author has no clue of the material he is writing about, he should do at least the minimal amount of research before writing, maybe he should write childrens books or some kind of sci-fi book. In my opinion he should never be allowed to publish anything again. Tim S."
1,Reductionist - distorted conclusions - lacking respect.,"I would give 0 stars if permitted.This book takes one aspect of broad phenomenon - and tries to make a general case. This is not good science - it's reductionism. It is like trying to define a cruise ship - by focusing on the type of anchor that is used. Once you focus on that narrow scope, your general conclusions and deductions - go very, very awry. Such work as this does more harm than good. It's a work filled with disrepect. Don't bother buying this book. For TS information, read ""The Uninvited Dilemma: A Question of Gender"" - a book which provides a more complete (and more correct) understanding."
1,wow,"From the ugly legs and tacky shoes to the ridiculous title--a bad taste parody of Kipling's ""The Man Who Would Be King""; and all the gross generalizations--unreal in any science field but much less when the subject of study is PEOPLE--the book is an absurdity of simplification.Bailey must have asked every friend and neighbor to write a 5 star review and that explains why there are so many of them, then so many militant opponents and almost nobody in between."
2,pros and cons,"Though this dissertation is an admitted intuition, it's presented as a scientific study which it's not. I'm guessing its primary purpose is just to seek attention. It should not be taken too seriously, and I have faith few professionals will take it to heart.Still it could be an eye-opener. The gay community has long felt the need to claim their condition is genetic and they can't help it. Similarly, transsexuals have long whined that they can't help it because they were just born in the wrong body. These claims may have some validity in many cases, but important contributing factors can easily be overlooked by accepting the simple explanation at face value.This report is definitely food for thought, but further exploration and review are needed to even begin to understand the roots and motivations for gay and transsexual behavior."
1,Eugenics in Pumps,"After reading this book and other Bailey ""studies"" it is clear that the ultimate goal of this ""research"" is the promotion of eugenics based on sexuality and gender identity and perhaps, ultimately, the attempted extermination of all non-heterosexual and/or gender-variant people worldwide. If this sounds like something you would be into, this book is a great resource for you. Might I also recommend a great little ditty called ""Mein Kampf"" too?"
3,Informative,"An informative book for those unfamiliar with the field. I felt his analysis on some points was a bit superficial, but he does have a real respect for facts. His theory of ""autogynephilic"" cross dressers was interesting, but unconvincing to me. I think there is a narcissistic element in all sexual orientations. His assertion that ""bisexuality"" is an empty category was not well supported. Probably the point regarding which I would most take exception with him is his apparent confidence that people fit into neat categories that are more than social constructions. In general I did not see it as either a great book nor a terrible book, but as a useful part of an ongoing conversation. Am puzzled as to why people seem to be so extreme in their assessment of this book. I might give is a 3 1/2.Jedson"
1,Just one persons bias corruptible view.,"Bailey's writing is appalling (worse than mine) He should stick to Academic writing and writing something he has knowledge of. In search of fame and fortune he has hung around in gay and Transsexual bars(wonder if it was JUST for fame and fortune)""one cannot understand Transsexualism without understanding Transsexuals SEXUALLY"" His words ,And low and behold come up with a load of tosh and managed to get an award for it!. Keep fiction and Fact separate. Perhaps his next book could be about how Africans having sex with monkey's brought about aids !!"
1,Where is the Research,"This book is unworthy of being called scientific or research. No scientific data is provided and no footnotes as to research is provided. The ""Research"" turns out to be casual conversations with transsexuals in gay bars at 2 AM. Compassionate Bailey is not as he stereotypes, women, men, gay men , lesbians, blacks, hispanic, and transsexuals."
1,Totally off base,"I am a postop transsexual woman. I find this book to run counter to my personal experience and to the experiences of the dozens, if not hundreds, of transsexual women whom I've met in the past decade.Mr. Baily might be discussing drag queens, transvestites, or transgendered people, but he is certainly not discussing transsexual women. He certainly interviewed a number of DQs, TVs, and TGs, but few, if any, transsexual women.If there were a lower rating than one star, I'd ""award"" it to this book.Don't waste your money on it. If you want to read a decent book about transsexuals, get a copy of _True Selves_ by Millie Brown and Chloe Rounsley and/or _Confessions of a Gender Defender_ by Randi Ettner"
1,"A trainwreck of an attempt at ""science""","If you want to see how science is NOT done, and how the author of this book became a laughing stock in his field of study, then buy this book and enjoy the schadenfreude. If you want to actually learn anything about transsexualism then don't bother, Bailey's just a shady fraud."
3,Why the controversy?,I was looking for a book on Cochran's germ theory of homosexuality. I ordered a book by his colaborator Ewald which I have not yet read. I also ordered this book expecting it to be a book about homosexuality too.Instead it's about transexuality. No harm done. It's short and anecdotal. I read it in a few hours. I haven't thought much about transexuals since I moved from San Francisco. It didn't seem very controverial to me.Then I read the reviews here. I can't help but suspect that there has been an organized effort to 'pack' this forum with negative reviews. It looks like some advocacy group mustered the troops to pile on.Personally I don't get it. Bailey may be wrong but no one would ever mistake this book for a serious exposition of a closely reasoned hypothesis. It is just anecdotes. As such it is amusing rather than enlightening. Why should it arouse such outrage? Bailey seems to be a mild mannered if slightly fuzzy headed minor academic.
4,Gritty and Honest,"Bailey's work is gritty, controversial, and sure to create a fire storm in the transsexual community. Many will see themselves reflected in the pages, but only after a gut wrenching bout of deep and honest introspection. However, caution must be taken, as with any reference working on the forefront of developing understanding, it cannot be taken as the final word, but rather an opening salvo for further discussion, debate, and research that will either reinforce or refute the evidence. Ultimately, as difficult as it might have been to read, Bailey's work has been a beacon of light to this conflicted soul."
3,"Hmm... Excellent writing, very tough subject","As with Ms. Cogan's first two captivating books, I read Crack at Dusk Crook of Dawn in one sitting. Although brilliantly written, the subject matter of extreme child abuse by a satanic cult is spelled out in full stomach-turning, heart-pounding detail (something I was unprepared for, and quite a deviation from her other writings). The path taken to heal the child is equally realistic, and although inspiring, did not balance for me the too-gruesome focus of the story..."
1,What is with today's society?,"What is with today's society that 'we' (not me) need the graphic details spelled out so thoroughly? What happened to the value of imagination and metaphor? I could go on, but I'll leave it to you (the intelligent reader) to fill in the overblown and unnecessary adjectives that I could use here. This book completely misses the point and value of Indian teachings."
3,Maps,"Unfortunely, I find only one problem with this map book and that is: You can't see the whole state you might be wanting to see. Other than that, it is nice."
2,Mine also died after 1.5 years,"I liked this product very much, until it died after a little under 1.5 years. I brought it to a repair center recommended by Panasonic. They quoted me a parts-and-labor price of around $125 to fix the thing. The repair included a new membrane pad (the buttons on the front), new fuse, and new fuse holder.The repair center told me they've been instructed by Panasonic to replace all old fuse holders with newer, better ones. Apparently, the original fuse holder was somewhat defective, causing the fuse to burn out. I don't know if this bears any relation as to why a relatively new membrane pad might have gone bad, but it's certainly annoying for a device costing several hundred dollars.Hopefully for me, my problem will be solved by the repair. Hopefully for any new buyer, Panasonic has solved this problem. Regardless, this type of poor quality rates two stars in my book."
3,"Looks nice, functions ok.","I have had mine for about 8 months now. For the most part it works well. I like the looks of it and it was not too difficult to install given it is a heavy, bulky piece of equipment. Some things I do not like about it:1. Does not heat food as well as my old counter top Sharp model which has less wattage.2. Has a fan that comes on full blast when too much heat is detected from the stovetop or oven. Ok, so anytime we cook something in the oven or stovetop for a long time the microwave fan is on full-blast and we are not able to stop it... a safety feature, but rather annoying!3. I like the light that lights up the stovetop, but it gets the inside of the microwave very hot... really hot for some reason.Again, this microwave looks nice, but there are probably better ones out there. I would not buy this again knowing what I know now."
2,Not too great,"Sorry, but this just doesn't do it for me. the first 4 tracks are good, but the rest is bland - just too heavy. I think they took a better approach to their second cd - the loopholes and great excuses EP, and i think they will keep getting better with age.Ans on the special edition of this cd - the live songs aren't worth anything - they sound like they were bootlegged by someone in the crowd with a dodgy tape recorder from the '70s.But if you are like me, you'll probably buy this anyway for your collection."
5,Best Techno,This is the greatest techno cd ever made. It just makes you get up and party. If your thinking of buying this CD you want regret it.
5,Best Basketball Training Aid,"If you could buy only one basketball training aid, this should be it. I've played ball for a long time, I'm 23 right now and I've only attended one basketball camp in my life. My basketball handles and court vision have always been just mediocre. Then I made an effort to improve these skills so I ordered these goggles and this is the single best training aid I've ever used. I was amazed at how sloppy my ball handling was after putting these on, I couldn't keep a consistent dribble without having the lower peripheral vision. These goggles force you to look down the court and your pg skills will greatly benefit. I'm in the process of doing intense dribbling drills with these goggles on to improve my ball handling, and I'm already starting to see noticable improvement. This is the hands down the best PG aid ever, and it would still be tremendously useful for any other player."
5,Great!,Kids were excited to use and work on their dribbling skills. I would recommend these for all who want to improve their ball handling skills.
5,Had me riveted.,"I found it to be scary, interesting and perhaps one of the best accounts of journalistic ethics I've heard of in a long time. Usually I don't equate journalism with ethics, but this little known gem of a story is one of the best books I remember reading in recent years."
1,DO NOT BUY! No drawer STOPS!!!! - Iris 6-Drawer Extra-Capacity Drawer Chest,"I have no idea what IRIS was thinking when they designed this product.The engineer should be fired.Who designs a drawer without a drawer stop?This was a gift and I am sending it back!!!DO NOT BUY!!!! and make sure that it is clearly written on any other product descriptions that you may be looking at.The features include .....""Drawer stops prevent drawers from falling out""What a joke!"
4,"Great, but not for everybody","I got this on cassette in 1987/88 and I don't think it was hot off the presses then, so it's definitely nostalgia material now. Lindenberg's voice is an acquired taste, and his penchant for the popular music of earlier decades may not be shared by everyone who likes 70s/80s rock. If the image of Erich Honecker slipping on a leather jacket, locking himself in the bathroom, and listening to Western radio stations (sung to the tune of ""Chattanooga Choo-Choo"") amuses you, this is the album for you. If your political views are right-wing, you'll hate it."
2,Ho Hum product,"Bought because it is red, works poorly, hard to get the can to ""catch"", magnetic lid snatch gets it the way. Would not buy again or recommend to others."
2,"Can't catch, can't hold","My experience was similar to other negative reviewers'. After a few months, it became almost impossible to get the opener to ""catch"" on the can and actually begin cutting. You need to jiggle and push and give it a running start.Also bothersome is the weakness of the magnet, which is essentially useless."
5,"Hamilton Beach 76383 Ensemble Tall Can Opener, Red","Product is attractive, easy to operate and performs well. Easy to detach opening mechanism for cleaning which is a real plus."
3,Quality ?,I ordered this online because I had gift certificates for moving. It says TALL can opener and I guess that is true because small ones just fall to the counter unless you hold on. For the price I was not impressed.
1,Not well made,"Frankly, I think the whole unit would fall down if you put a can of any weight on it. Really pretty junky! I returned it."
2,Wish I'd Listened to the Negative Reviews,"This can opener is mediocre. It's adequate for me, my husband hates it and won't use it. He can never get it to go in the right place to open the can. My biggest problem with it is how it sounds like a 747, even when there's no can on it. I'm sure there are better can openers out there. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this one."
5,Christmas gift,"The Hamilton beach can opener is the best, I purchased it for my daughters family. The were in need of one. What is so special is the cutting edge pulls out and you are able to put in dishwasher. The cord is hidden in the back and the color red is perfect match to her kitchen. I have the same one (black) and have had for over 8 years. A great can opener."
2,"Like Dale E. Guckenberger, I can't recommend this one much at all...","And although it is BY F-A-R, the prettiest piece of work I've ever seen, can opener-wise, I think it's a red piece of junk metal. Seriously. I have never been so disappointed in a can opener since our manual one would just sit there, as you turned the crank, and it did nothing!; no cutting, no ripping, no cuts, NOTHING.I am very sad about this, and would advise my Mother to take it back, had she N-O-T L-O-S-T the God-Forsaken box that went with it (What's new??)!!!!!Overall, I hate this thing, and wish Death by fire on it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Look: A++ (Cherry red, silver can opener)Design: D- (Some sharp piece gets in the way, as You actually try to cut the damn cans open! >__<q)Price: A+Worth: D-2.5 stars.Overall: F+"
2,There are better sanders out there,"I purchased this sander for use in my cabinet making business as a successor to my aging Dewalt DW420, which was a good sander but is no longer available. The D26450 is a poor substitute. It's powerful enough and the dust bag works pretty well, but it takes 2 hands to keep this unit from dancing all over the work piece. Even when you can control it, the results are not impressive. It leaves swirls in the wood, even when sanding to 220, that clearly show up when finishing, especially with darker stains. This was not the case with the DW420. It's bad enough that I'm replacing this sander after only 1 year, even though it still functions. Just another in a growing line of disappointing products from Dewalt/Porter-Cable/Delta."
2,Very Simplistic,"This book was an easy read and Very Simplistic. If you have absolutely No knowedge of Out of Body Experiences you may find it interesting. If you have some or a lot of information already, you will not find anything interesting in this book. I found it to be too simplistic and boring. Your better off spending your money on a book by Robert Monroe or William Buhlman."
3,A SAD LETDOWN.,"I picked up this book with extreme anxiousness, as it came to me highly recommended. What I found upon reading this book is a carbon copy of what so many others have already said on the subject. It is well written, but no new information on the subject of ASTRAL PROJECTION was found by this reviewer. Although only mildly interesting to me (with over 30 years experience in astral travel) I do think that this book would be of more interest to the layman in the field. Previous experienced travelers need not waste your money or time."
2,"ok, but.......","Albert Taylors writing is quick and easy, but I didn't feel that this was a guide book that I was looking for. I am trying to figure out what this sleep paralysis thing that has been happening to me is, and heard of him on Art Bell. I was anxious for some insight on the subject and I liked the way Albert Taylor described then on Art's show, but the book had too many personal account's and not enough guidance. I too want to return it!"
2,Hmmm. Yeah. I don't know.....,"My first out-of-body experience this past summer prompted me to search out some literature on the subject with a sense of urgency I rarely encounter. Unfortunately I found the language of Soul Traveler harmful to Taylor's image as an authority on the subject. He's backed by experience that I can only imagine, but his commentary was elementary, and his personal insights were a little tedious. I'm sad to admit that I returned the book the same day I bought it (possibly in haste). I've heard some good things about Robert Monroe's ""Ultimate Journey."" I'm about to see what this book is like..... If you want a more enlightening study on not just OBEs but everything else under the umbrella of life and death check out Seth Speaks, by Jane Roberts. I'm thankful that Albert Taylor included Seth Speaks in his list of recommended reading. It's one of those books that changes the way you think..."
2,Hidden god propaganda,"Not the best I`ve readen about the subject, but okay. It explains poorly how to induce sleep paralysis and how to astral project, but it`s interesting to read about his own experiences (alltough I think he`s lying for the most part). The thing I don`t like about this book is that it has hidden god propaganda. While you read it the word god pops up now and then, and it finish with even more talk about god. Don`t know about you, but I`m tired of having every conversation and book ruined of nonsense about some god. Will I recommend this book to anyone? No, there are better books out there."
4,A Good Basic Book on OOBE's,"Albert Taylor's book is not only fascinating and enjoyable, but extremely easy to understand. Written in a journal-type format with the bulk of the book containing details of his experiences on the astral, this book reads almost like a novel. In fact you can probably read it in one sitting if you chose to. On the plus side he keeps the tone of the book very simple and straightforward. For those who enjoy the simplicity, this book is a good place to start your journey.For those however who enjoy something more scientific and written in greater detail, which is the minus side of this book - no detail - then I would recommend William Buhlman's book 'Adventure's Beyond the Body,' which I honestly believe to be a much better book. But for the easily befuddled, this book is a blessing."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on This Book,"This book looked like it was done on a typewriter and appeared disjointed. Bought it as a Christmas gift for my brother, so was disappointed. My brother didn't like it very much, saying it was a bunch of articles from the author ""thrown together and not well written."" He also says the book doesn't really cover the basics and fails to build on it very well. Spend your hard earned money on another book on this topic."
1,Unpleasent,I am sorry to say this book is very poor and useless in the practical way. I dislike it very much. Look for something else on the issue.
4,Nice,"Really like this CD. Nice mix of jazz, rock, r&B ad spoken word gospel. Then Came You is the fav for me!"
4,Great book!,Very satisfied with the handwriting lessons and how they're organized. We also use Book A for my 4-year-old son and we'll continue with this series in future years.
1,major disappointment,"After reading Dr. Goulston's book ""just listen"" I had very high expectations as I found that book very useful and full of proven tips and practical examples.I was all the more disappointed when I opened this book.Covering procrastination in 3 pages? come on.Most of the other self-defeating behaviors do not get more room either.highly superficial and unfortunately not worth the money."
3,Good overview of common work failings,"Get Out of Your Own Way at Work...And Help Others Do the Same by Mark Goulston is a fast, digestible read on a variety of failings that might beset you or a colleague at work. Procrastination, not taking No for an answer, and staying too long in a job you should leave are just 3 of the 40 items covered in the book. Each item has an anecdote to give it 3-d clarity, helpful tips, and a quote. All in all the short chapters provide a good snapshot of what the problem is and some strategies to address it.Goulston created a very efficient book and seems to know his stuff. While I liked the breadth of it, I wanted to go deeper on each, even if it meant leaving some out. But that's my preference. This is a good book for the reference shelf when you find yourself stuck in a work rut or managing a difficult team member. You can get some quick tips and inspiration here."
1,Lots of name dropping but little else...,"Although younger than Wakefield, I was around NYC, especially the Village, in the '50s & I was really looking forward to ""looking back"" at a unique time & place. This book was a real disappointment, unfortunately, with little more to offer than big (& not so big) names & parties. I found it very superficial & self-promoting, in effect light weight *gossip*, which in the end is very shrewd on the part of author & publisher, but oh so cynical."
3,Manhattan in the 1950s,"Wakefield reports that, in the 1950s, he bought in to the lifestyle of Greenwich Village--he was committed to it. During the day, he and his fellow writers wrote for magazines (Dissent, Commentary, The Atlantic Monthly, Nation and Village Voice) that espoused a leftist ideology. At night, the conversations in the Manhattan bars reflected their commitment to this ideology.Wakefield outlined how three different parts of the Village community--writers, artist, and jazz musicians--connected with each other in select bars in the community. Complementing and enriching this network were the political writers of a radical bent such as Michael Harington and James Agee. Both of these men were regulars at the bars frequented by Wakefield, Norman Mailer and others. This interconnected network was also strengthened by the fact that the literary writers as well political writers published articles in the same Manhattan journals."
5,WHAT A BLESSING!!,"SUFFERING FROM SEVERE DERMATITIS I WAS INSTRUCTED TO USE AB UNSCENTED SOAP AND CETAPHIL WAS RECOMMENDED BY MY DOCTOR.I HAD BEEN USING UNSCENTED DOVE SOAP WHICH DID NOT REALLY HELP AND LEFT A FILMY EFFECT WHEN ONE STEPPED OUT OF THE SHOWER.I TRIED A COUPLE OF SAMPLES AND IT DOES SEEM TO HELP AND APPEARS TO DININISH THE SEVERE ITCHING.QUITE EXPENSIVE IN LOCAL STORES BUT BUYING 6-12 BARS FROM AMAZON.COM REDUCES THE PRICE, WICH IS NOT HARD TO TAKE.SO FAR, I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND PLANNING TO TRY THEIR SKIN LOTION.THIS CONDITION IS INCURABLE AND AN ITCHING MAN HAS TO REACH FOR ANY STRAWS, SO TO SPEAK.I RECOMMEND AT LEAST GIVING THIS PRODUCT A TRY. THERE IS NOTHINGTO LOSE AND MORE TO GAIN."
2,Questionable!,"I tried Cetaphil after getting some from my dermatologist. Before that point I had never had wrinkles underneath my eyes. I used the soap as directed and my face became highly inflamed and was bright red for two days. My skin began to peel like crazy, and I developed HUGE wrinkles underneath my eyes. I went to my dermatologist and he simply told me it was not possible and sent me on my way. DO NOT buy this product!"
2,Low Cholesterol Cookbook for Dummies,"I was looking for an actual cookbook, with lots of recipes. There are recipes, but they're hidden in all the writing. This book is too wordy. Yes, I want to and need to know more about Cholesterol, but that's not what I bought this book for.My big mistake was that I bought two of them sight-unseen. I had planned to send one to my mom. After looking through it, I knew it would turn her off also. So now I'm stuck with two copies of the same cookbook I don't want and shouldn't have spent the money on to begin with.I'm not saying it's not a good book. It's just not a good *cook* book. It should be advertised as book on Cholesterol with recipes, not as a cookbook."
2,Not-So-Practical Cookbook,"Since my wife's blood tests recently came back reflecting a higher-than-acceptable cholesterol level, we thought that we'd pick this up for some ideas as to some beneficial meals. But, upon review, there are few ""normal"" or ""practical"" recipes!! Most require ingredients that we don't normally have on hand and some of which we had never heard! I understand that ""cheeseburgers and fries"" would not be included in most ""low cholesterol"" cookbooks but there have to be more recipes that require more usual or normal ingredients. It's that book for which we are still looking and, I'm sure, will find. This ""Dummies"" book will serve as a conversation piece, at best. It's pretty-much a waste of money..."
1,Not Great,This cookbook read more like a computer technical manual than a cookbook. I should know; I used to write computer technical manuals. This was less user friendly than something written by IBM.
4,It's an okay book,"I've found that the ""Dummies"" books are 98% reading and 2% practical advice. I am a busy person and do not have the time to read all of the information regarding cholesterol and how the body handles too much of it. Yes, I did learn some things. The homemade tortilla chip recipe was good but the book neglected to say how long you can store these chips in your pantry. Some of the recipes were not well known and so the book has been sitting on the shelf in my kitchen instead of being used."
4,Full of great info....,"This book has a lot of very good information, but it lacks in the area of recipes.... I thought it would be full of low-cholesterol recipes since it is a cookbook. There are some, but not what a cookbook usually holds."
4,Lots of good info,I am not a gourmet cook so some of the ingredients I don't have but there are easy substitutions. Tried the tuna cakes - really good. Oatmeal cookies also good. Still looking through it but overall an excellent source of info & tips. Would recommend.
2,Don't like the recipes,"Maybe there needs to be 2 editions of this book. This one is more for the gourmet cook who likes to visit little food marts and try exotic recipes. I'm the type who doesn't like to cook much and wants to get out of the grocery store in 15 minutes flat. I'm fine with microwaving frozen veggies or topping a potato with store-bought salsa, and I have to look up instructions when I want to make hard-boiled eggs. I just want a few quick, simple recipes that use everyday ingredients. The ones in this book are unappealing and annoying for me."
3,"to an extent, it's ok","although this book might help you to eat intuitively, it does little to overcome overeating. it does little to deal with the true cause of overeating- the pleasure you get from it. trust me when i say that if you eat compulsively, this book won't help much. all this book does is tell you to never diet, which is a good start ( that's why i gave it 3 stars and not 1) but it won't solve nearly all of your problems with food. You still have to resolve WHY you eat & overeat.all in all, this book is just to break you away from dieting, it's not to solve your overeating problem, nor will it tap into your unconscious.If you get pleasure from food, then you need to find out why you're using for constant pleasure. ( you stuff yourself senseless because unless food is extremely good, it does little pleasure, so you keep eating to get the fill )"
3,"Good but skims over the #1 reason for eating ""problems""","I read this book over and over. I know it works but I could not get my behavior in sync with natural eating. Until I sought professional help. Mild-heavy depression, bi-polar, and other conditions that cause a serious drop in seratonin to the brain among other complications may in fact be the cause of your overeating more than you estimated. I feel like if I would have just sought help from a professional earlier I could have avoided a lot of pain mentally emotionally-all over. As I adjusted to meds I felt the cloud that proceeds binge eating disappear. As good as this book is, it kept me from seeking help. The authors mention in one sentence that some of their clients have gone on to seek psychiatric help. I think this needs more attention than one sentence. When your body's chemistry is off it is hard to explain to others how and why you cannot change. Good luck sisters."
5,Really helpful to begin learning how to relate properly with food,"I grew up in an eat a lot family.After loosing over 100lbs. I've struggled for over 2 years with eating. I knew what I should and shouldn't eat, but at the end of the day I occasionally overate and this inhibited health, fitness and weight goals.Intuitive Eating is helping me on the road to relating to food properly again. It's allowing me to enjoy food again for real. It's a process, but one I happy to be in."
2,Intuitive Eating,"This is just another diet book that doesn't call itself that!!That seems to be the trend these days.""Let's call it a change in life style. They won't know the difference"""
2,I'm Hungry!,I highly recommend you do NOT listen to this audio Book while driving...Two reasons...#1. You may drive into a Fast food place and binge!#2. You may fall Asleep at the WheelR
1,Give me a break!,"This is just another excuse for overweight people to justify eating whatever they want. The author of this book is attempting to profit from the weakness and emotional desire of obese people to feel ""better"" about their eating habits. If you're overweight, eat more nutritional foods in smaller quantities throughout the day and excercise a couple times a week. It's not rocket science."
3,Diet? Never again. Halelujah!,"I loved reading this book. After a lifetime of dieting, and gaining it all again, thirty years of trying every diet around, finally relief. Eat what you want and enjoy it. All the good things I have been denying myself are now back on the menu. Nice crusty fresh bread and salad with DRESSING, a glass of wine, a POTATO! Two potatoes. Maybe three. Don't worry. My body is supposed to regulate itself and gradually I will become a slim person, at my natural, ideal weight. I just have to forget about dieting. Just who am I kidding? After three weeks on this wonderful regime I am six pounds heavier. I think I better look for a new diet book. There is enough of them around."
3,"a readable ""diet"" book","Reads like promotional literature, as if it is selling me on the program as I'm reading it. I would have been turned off but it is recommended reading by my diet group.I'm not in the habit of reading diet or self help books. This one is an easy read and is not too dry, holds my interest (so far). Its a book I can put down but not one I have to struggle to read."
4,intuitive eating a vevolutionary program that works,I haven't finished the book yet but what I've read so far - I findinlighting - I't on the money - it goes to the root cause of theproblem - learning how to eat properly in the key - and I give thanksto the authors for this inspiring work.
4,Nurse/Author's Comments,Very health conscious and supportative book from the view point of a nurse and an author.
3,for the chronic dieter,This book is for the chronic dieter. People that have a lot of guilt around the subject of food should read this book.
3,Intuitive Eating Can Be Confused with Rationalization Eating,"I think that intuitive eating as the authors describe it is possible, but it has to be after have been guided properly by someone who has helped you to develop new taste and inclinations for certain foods. I think that intuitive eating happens after you have changed not during your change in what you crave. One must be careful in placing too much emphasis on the food aspect and not balance it equally with a focus on enough of the right kind of exercise, which in my experience has been progressive weight resistance.Can one eat intuitively? Yes and no. Not without proper guidance of a nutritional overseer in addition to following the principles outlined in this book."
1,A dangerous concept,"Intuitive eating is a dangerously unhealthy concept to apply to anyone with an eating disorder (and that may be 90% of the population). My anorexic daughter's nutritionist applied the principles of intuitive eating to my daughter for the past 5 months and managed to guide her further into her disease and oversee a 14 pound weight loss. Thanks to this eating concept, my daughter is back in a residential eating disorder clinic. I'm abhorred that someone with a nutrition education and a theoretical 7-years of experience treating anorexics would misapply such concepts."
5,I recommend this book for all my clients.,"I have taught eating disorders clients to eat intuitively for over a decade and have had all of my clients (both inpatients and outpatients) read this book. The chapter ""gentle nutrition"" has been confusing for clients who are not fully out of their eating disorder or those with dichotomous(black and white) thinking. I also recommend ""One Day at a Time Food Journal"" which compliments Intuitive Eating and many clients find very helpfulOne Day at a Time- Food Journal and Hunger Fullness Monitor."
5,AMAZING,"I am in the middle of reading Intuitive Eating right now and already my thoughts about food and bingeing have changed. I have alot of food allergies and food restrictions and have found myself in the past year going through vicious cycles of bingeing on foods that I have determined are ""bad"" foods and ones I should stay away from alltogether or limit myself from having atleast once a week and therefor it turned into a pattern of not only bingeing on these foods but also purgeing and I never thought I'd be rid of all my obsessive thoughts about food or weight until I found this book and for once I truly feel like I can change my thinking and change my life for the better."
5,Great book!,"I found this book to be very helpful in letting go of the guilt associated with eating & re-training my body to eat when I am only really & truly biologically hungry. Easy to understand & completely logical, I would recommend this book to anyone who struggles with diets."
5,All Dieters NEED this,"Anyone who has ever struggled with dieting or has ever had trouble controlling the amount of food they eat or has ever suffered from an eating disorder must have this book. It is a life saver.You will learn how to have a positive, healthy relationship with food again. You will stop binging, emotional eating and eating out of control. You will find that after reading this book, you will never need to diet again because you will be so in tune with your body that you will only eat the type and amount of food that it needs. Your body will naturally return to the weight it was meant to be... permanently. This book is the end of restricting food, starvation, binging, guilt and fluctuating weight.I am a psychologist who has struggled with a binge eating disorder for years. I am now able to truely eat what I want, when I want without gaining weight or over eating. I will be using this program to treat patients who struggle with food."
4,Excellent Theory and Well Worth a Read,"I won't wax poetic or philosophical about this book, but I found it very helpful. The authors provide very good sound information on how to approach compulsive overeating without being over preachy or using too much ""psychobabble."" I have tried to read other books on compulsive overeating and found them a bit depressing.I can't say that I have actually been able to follow this. My issues with food run a bit more deep, but I did receive a new outlook on food and my own personal behavoirs. I am a work in progress, but I think this is a wonderful resourse.Highly recommended for anyone who feels that they eat at times when they are not specifically hungry."
3,A good book but avoid chapter 10!,"I can't figure this book out-- it starts out great, with lots of thoughtful ideas for combating emotional overeating. Then I got to chapter 10, ""Gentle Nutrition"". All of a sudden, it's a diet book, with the same old stuff you can read in any Weight Watchers type book. That chapter is in complete opposition to the intuitive eating principles presented in the rest of the book. Without that chapter, I would have given a five star review."
5,Amazing CD...an end to dieting for good.,"I bought these cd's with the book. I am so happy I did! I have listened to the set 4 times now and I find new and fresh perspective every time I listen. There are activities you can do with the cd's that are not in the book, so it makes a great addition to the book. I am forever happy that I purchased this set. Intuitive eating is the end to dieting and obsessions with food and body image that really works. I feel so much more free because of it. If you can learn to trust the process and do the work it takes, you will find success. It will be hard, but well worth it. An awesome cd set!!"
5,an amazing revolutionary way to look at eating,"This book and this way of eating is the only way to think about food! In America, we are too obsessed with quick fix diets that never work, but Intuitive Eating is a life style change that truly works and it is something anyone can do. And it is not difficult, it makes sense, and it is totally freeing from the rigid rules of all diets. I believe this is a book everyone should read!"
5,I learned a ton about why I overeat,"I learned tons from this book about the reasons why I overeat.Before this book, I thought I just overeat, it is a common problem.After this book, I understand that there are types and groups of reasons why I overeat.I have been slowing down now, and reflecting on bad childhood memories that are the basis for my anxiety:my mother giving the best cuts of meat to my brothers;my mother making me serve dinner to all the male members of the family before I could sit down to eat;my mother telling me that I eat too much;watching my mother gain weight over the years and believing that that is my fate too so why try to fight it;panicking that I had to hide the sweets or someone else would take them all from me and not leave any for me....Yes, there are emotional reasons why we eat, and only by talking about it and thinking out, we can overcome them."
5,I love this book.,This book supports everything I was learning while in a 12week binge eating disorder program at a local hospital here in the Twin Cities. Intuitive eating was a major part of healing and decreasing my binges.
3,Kindle version needs table of contents.,Not easy to find your way around this book with Kindle. Really needs a table of contents.Don't get the kindle book. Several of the pages are messed up and you can't read them.
3,Eh! OK.,I had high hopes for this book but only got about half way through it. It's a great concept but I'm not sure it's a realistic one for most people.
3,medium,"looked a littele different on the web page photo. I actualy never wore it because, it looks nothing like kenneth cole shoes i have bought before.sorry,"
3,A Journal Of Self Discovery,"The book is beautifully done. However, I was sort of disappointed because of the lack of information. There are a lot of things for me to fill out but not enough stuff for me to read. However, it IS a journal but I wish it was more detailed about what it wanted me to write and such. There are some things in here you can fill in once and if you want to fill it in again, you have to erase which is sometimes a pain.I think this book is for younger girls. If you want a mature book with a lot of good information, I would suggest The Care and Keeping of You.Although I'm disappointed, I definitely don't regret buying it but you should have the companion book (The Care of and Keeping of You: The Body Book For Girls) first before getting the journal.Have fun!"
5,Great book to help your tween girl,"This book was recommended to me by two people and I am so glad I got it. My 10 yr old daughter has written quite a bit in it. It has simple, appropriate explanations for the changes her body is going through. It's also a helpful way for girls to learn about the importance of hygiene etc. from another source besides their 'parent'. Books know more than parents do, right?!"
5,Get this book!,"I took a course in teaching brass instruments at the University of North Texas this past semester. Scott Whitener's book was one of the texts used in the course. I believe that anyone wishing to learn more about brass instruments would benefit from reading Scott Whitener's book. He discusses the basic concepts of brass playing, mouthpieces, trumpets, trombones, tubas, horns, baritones/euphoniums, breathing, articulation, posture, instrument care, tone production, and the historical development of brass instruments. Enjoy!"
4,AWESOME!,awesome just what i need for class =) the book took a little more time to get here but its good.
3,Complete Guide to Brass book/CD,"Book was in good condition, but the CD was snapped in half.I'm not sure that was mentioned in the item description, but for $70, it probably should have been."
3,A must have Low Brass Book....,"The book is awesome, price and delivery were almost flawless accept for the missing CD. Online Amazon advertised the book with CD included, no CD was included in package. So please list accurately in the future..."
5,AWESOME !!!!!,This book is written from the heart of my grandfather and this book helped me understand him in a different way than just as my fathers father but as a hard working person.- C. Frandsen
2,Not for Moebius fans,"As a fan of Moebius I found this very disappointing. Moebius is known for his Sci-Fi/fantasy and westerns. The artwork in the SF work is amazing and the stories are usually pretty good too. The westerns rely mostly on the story and the art work is OK. Icaro has a story that moves glacially slow and the all black and white art work is pedestrian at best. Did Moebius really have a hand in this?? Yes, it's pretty clear from the images that he did, but the effort is Way below Airtight Garage, Incal, Arzach, Lt. Blueberry, etc. Two thumbs down."
5,A childhood favorite,"This was my favorite book to have my parents read to me when I was a child. Now, I'm ordering a copy for my three sons and am looking forward to reading it to them when it arrives. Though it's been over 15 years since I've read it, I can still remember the first few pages. ""Today I'm a grown-up. And I'm a grown up too! We're very busy doing what we grown-up people do!"" Classic! :o)"
3,mojo rocks,Mojo is an awsome song. Bought the albumn because of it. Everything else was a disapointment. Sample the cd before you buy!!!
4,mike patton's pop record...,"his intentions are a little confusing, but i think on the whole this worked out pretty well considering it seemed like it would never happen. definitely worth it for the Dub Trio track (check out their super-ridiculously tight album New Heavy from which this song is taken), the Massive Attack song, the fact that he got Norah Jones to act that sexy, and the amazing packaging. It really is pretty incredible packaging."
2,"So many amazing collaborators, all essentially phoning it in.","I'm sorry, but this material just sounds so tired. Instantly dated. This record doesn't bring anything new to the table. I would even contend that it swings the pendulum back. This stuff might have sounded fresh in the '90s. And even then it would have been considered just an O.K. record.It's perplexing that such an amazing list of collaborators could yield a product that sounds this diluted, mediocre and well, just plain boring. Particularly disappointing are the Kool Keith and Massive Attacks tracks.Come on, Mike. This is 2006. You're a talented guy. Step up your game, baby!"
2,Patton fails - again,"I really like what Mike Patton did with Faith No More and what he does now with Dan the Automator (ex. Lovage - Music to make love to your old lady by). I hated his ""noise"" experiments with Fantomas, Tomahawk, Mr. Bungle. Now with Peeping Tom, the tracks are actually songs, but they're just not any good. The guy has mad talent and I like his voice, but he stepped up to the plate here and struck out on all tracks. Not a single decent one you'd want to listen to again.All the 5-star reviews are straight Patton fanboys that would give him 5-stars for punching them about the head and upper body."
4,It's Real Good!,"If you don't like this, you're obviously a result of bad genetics. Your parents were relatives, and God f'd up your eardrums in vengeance. Audibly-speaking, you can't tell a plate of goose-turds from a bowl of foie gras. You fool.This is not only a good album. It's foie-gras for your ears. Spoon that stuff in there, buddy. It's good!If you don't like it at first, wait a while. Listen again, this time carefully. If you still don't like it, I'm sorry, but you're most- likely inbred. I feel for you. I'm sure a cure of some kind is on the way. Enjoy the new Black Eyed Peas album in the meantime! Sorry!"
5,Fresh air from Patton,"A proper gem of an album. Patton's best stuff since California. His vocals have taken on an early Faith No More guise but benefit from 15 years maturity. The album also benefits from a diverse range of collaborators. All the tunes are standout but my personal favourites are the rockin' Massive Attack collaboration -- ""Kill the DJ"" (just try and suppress the urge to nod your head!), and the ultra-catchy ""Don't Even Trip"". Highly highly recommended for Patton fans in particular."
4,Well Done Mr. Patton,"Wow -- I'm listening to this for the second time right now. The first time through, just under half of the record was great on first listen -- more so on the second trip. This is a great effort.On the X-Excutioners collaboration, I was frequently left thinking ""D'oh! But I liked that part! Do that a while longer!"" This album has the same feel as that one (not as Zorn-like) but less indulgent. Definitely lots of conscious pop-styling.When I introduced one of my friends to GWAR many years ago, he said after his second or third show ""You know why they're better than any other metal band? Because they're making fun of metal AND they're a great metal band. Thus they transcend all others.""Patton is doing the same thing here. He's frickin' Dionne Warwick on track 7 and it's great!Yes, this one will probably grow into 5 stars."
3,Timing is everything,"I enjoyed this album quite a bit, but the amount of time it spent sitting on the shelf prior to release lessened its impact significantly. By the time this thing finally saw the light of day, Patton had already trumped himself several times over during his collaborations with Rahzel and The X-Ecutioners, making this effort seem redundant and watered down in comparison. It's still good and I've listened to it many, many times, but it's definitely not as cutting edge as it would have been when it was first conceived."
3,This isn't DISCO ?!?,"Made in GER in 19??, Serial# 833-129-2, Playing Time 48:32If you're looking for a calypso record, continue shopping: this is KS's 3rd album, an electronic journey through space.The first track (""Ways Of Changes"") is probably his most enthusiastic to date, and besides the layers of keyboards, also includes percussion and 12-string guitar. His ""charmiest"" track to date.The second track, the short (by his standards) 8+1/2 minute ""Some Velvet Phasing"", is soft, spacy, and almost lethargic, perfect for relaxation or to induce sleep.The third/last track, ""Voices Of Syn"", contains in the early section some vocals of Verdi's ""Collage"" by the bass-voice of Ernst Walter Siemon. It's, to my tastes, the weakest track on the album: some drone melody that left me wanting for greater development and more elaborate textures.It's nonetheless a good evolution in ""polish"" from its predecessor, ""Cyborg""."
2,"Early, Awkward Schulze","""Blackdance"" is an early, clunky Schulze composition that doesn't quite come off. Though Schulze was beginning to find his voice at this point, this album lacks the complexity and ethereal qualities of his later 70's work. The opening track, ""Waves of Changes,"" is primarily 20 minutes of a bongo drum beat with gritty, hollow synth noodling over the top. ""Some Velvet Phasing"" is synth noodling without the bongo drum beat. And the last and longest track, ""Voices of Syn"" features an operatic baritone voice singing a very dark and beautiful melody, but soon dissolves into an almost unlistenable scratchy drum beat for the next 15 minutes. There are parts that Schulze fans will enjoy, especially in the first track, but by and large a dull and dissapointing album."
2,Too good to be true,"Great price and free shipping for Amazon prime. Unfortunately, it requires perfect power source. Westinghouse tech support said this is often a problem with this model. I tried several outlets and couldn't get it to work properly. It would turn on and off by itself randomly. Can't really be sure if it's a design flaw or maybe a bad power supply in the TV itself. Doesn't really matter if you can't control when your TV is on or off. What a disappointment."
3,OK For the Price,"Given the price, this is not a bad TV. It does suffer from occasional processing lag, though, and cannot be viewed from as broad an angle as you'd like."
3,Think!,"I am a owner of Canon camcorder now. I thought of buying this product, as it is for a good price, but I stumbled upon a better model ZR80 for a much much cheaper rate(only canon knows why it is so). Try to do a search on it and you will find too. I am not here to say that ZR60 is a bad camcorder. I am just saying that it isn't a good choice if you are looking for a handycam in this range."
3,i would get it but HMMMMMMMMMMM HUMMMM,"I wouldn't get this camcorder. It looks really good with its [inexpensive] price, size, and nice features but it has horrible Indoor quality (stinks in dim light) and can you say HUMM? LOL. It has major motor problems and it comes on tape. If theres a quiet enviroment u will hear it but other wise u won't. It all depends. So what im saying its only good outdoors, in day time, and in loud environment. I would suggest checking out Sony Camcorders (trv22 or 19). I know they are really [costly] but sorry....camcorders are geting real [poor] these days and the only way is to get a sony ...Or maybe you could just get a used one so its not big on ur budget!"
1,Poor Picture,This camera has an absolutely horrible picture. This is the type of technology I'd expect from a camera made in the '70s.
1,8 months old & already problems!,"We purchased this camcorder in October of 2003, and by June 2004 the pause button has already quit working. We have only had light to moderate use of this camcorder since purchasing it. It is still covered under the one year warranty, but we have to ship it all the way to California from Arkansas (and yes we have to pay for the shipping and handling), and it will not be back before our vacation. They will not cover it unless it is shipped to them. I would think twice before purchasing this product."
2,It doesn't work,"I bought this unit about 5 years ago and used it quite extensively, but then for 3 years it sat in a drawer unused. Now, planning a trip,I resurrected it, but found that I couldn't see images through the view finder. I took it to Best Buy, and they thought that the shutter was defective. I then went to Circuit City and they recommeded trying a head cleaner. I ran the head cleaner, and it started to work at firstbut then the same thing happened again - no viewer image. I'm not sure what to do, maybe send it to Canon and see what they say."
3,Motor noise is a real problem,"I bought this camera today and am returning it tomorrow. The problem is the constant whine from the internal motor which is very audible on playback. I wish this weren't a problem because I like the camera and love the price. If you're hearing isn't that sharp or you don't tend to notice these things, the whine might not bother you. But if you are the type of person (like me) who is irritated by a low, whining sound in the background of your videos, steer clear of this camera. P.S., the ONLY reason I sought out online reviews (and discovered these) is because I noticed the whining right away and wanted to see if I had a lemon or if it was a common complaint."
3,Not very great,"Tried this camcorder for a day, was amazed by the style, features and ease of use for the price. if somebody is cash crunched but wants to buy one, they could go in for this. The low light problem some people complained was not an issue for me. It performed decently ok. But the reason why I returned it back was because of the low noise (internal) which you could hear when recording and most importantly appears in the recording very prominently. I think Canon is a good company but this product is not upto the mark."
3,Decent camcorder,"Low light performance is bad and Canon customer service is awful, but the camcorder is decent for the price. You might be happier spending more money to get a better picture (look at the 3ccd camcorders from Panasonic) but this one will work fine for taping birthday parties."
1,Poor customer service,"Just like consumer reports rates Canon as prone to repair, they were positively correct. We bought a ZR45 one year ago and it is already broken, costing us double the price of it to repair it. They will not do anything for us. They tell us now that if you go to humid climates with their camcorders you can get battery corrosion from the moisture, and that is what we got. There repair department and company have been horrible to work with, we are still not satisfied with their decision of not helping us just after one year. We will not be buying another Canon product."
2,Worked fine - died just out of warranty,"I had a Sony Hi-8 that was great. I love my Canon digital cameras so I thought I'd get a Canon MiniDV. Well, it works fine and has good features. The video is great, the audio and low light is probably not up to the Sony camcorders. Still, for the money I liked it and was happy. Just out of warranty it goes black and won't record. The shutter or CCD is dead. Reading online this seems to be a common problem with Canon camcorders. So, my new Sony MiniDV is rocking. If you are looking at a Camera, get a Canon, if you are looking at camcorders, get a Sony."
1,Breaks after warranty expires,I thought I made a good purchase. i didn't want a real expensive camcorder and this one had everything I wanted. However 13 months after i bought it the LCD viewfinder stopped working. Every other function worked except the only thing I could record was black. Plus the camera won't be repaired until after Christmas. If you choose to buy this camrea beware and buy an optional warranty because you will be repairing it.This is the last Canon product I'll ever purchase!
2,"ZR60 pleases me, for about 9 months","This was a video camera of mine before it broke. It truly is bad. The camera itself is excellent. But you think Canon, you think good name. Ask any professional in the digital world, they will say get a SONY. My ZR60 broke 9 months in, just having digital explosions. It is a good camera until it breaks, and it will. Canon has a 1/3 faliure rate, which was a 1/2 for quite some time. Just spend a few extra bucks, and please buy a sony."
3,not a bad buy,"I bought this camera because I needed for school, The zoom is outstanding, I can zoom into tiny print and the camera stays focused quite well, The image tends to be grainy which gets worse as light is reduced. The ergonomics are outstanding and the lay out is logical. My biggest complaints is this camera doesn't use a memory card for still images, it saves them to the tape, this proves to be more trouble than it's worth. Also the camera has no USB connections, it has Firewire and S-Video, but they omitted the most common type of connection. I have firewire but that isn't the point. And last and maybe least, you have to remove any tri-pod mount in order to change tapes, (inserts in the bottom) aside from these minor issues I am very happy with this camera and would recomend it as a good starter mini-dv cam."
4,No problems after 3 years and still great value,"Great value for the money (at the time, and now). Very high quality images in good lighting, especially outdoors; average to lower quality in low lighting (but hard to blame this on Canon; my old Sony was worse). No motor noise or any other problems. No problems with buttons, functions, etc. Just thinking about a new one now since the 2.2M pixel CCDs are the norm now, and this one has less."
4,Great for the budding documentary filmmaker,"PROS: Color viewfinder, good resolution, light-weight, easy to handle (at least for small-handed people like myself), nice look, automatic white balance on auto setting, excellent zoom, great selection of accessories, manual is easy to understand, more pros than cons.CONS: No headphone or mic jacks, slightly annoying motor noise, battery level measured by 10's only (i.e. 40 m, 50 m, etc.).In short, an excellent starter camera, but may not be fantastic for more experienced filmmakers.Be sure to take extra batteries and tapes (I recommend TDK for the tapes), as well as a cleaning cassette, with you when you go to shoot."
2,Wouldn't buy JVC again,"This camera is an OK camera as far as features go. But like the other reviewer stated, there is no external mic input which is a big down side. The auto stablizer sucks so I was forced to buy a tripod for any kind of shooting I do.JVC customer service is horrible! My camera broke after only 3 hours of using it. Seems that there is some sort of tracking issue during playback. I asked if they could fax over a copy of the proof of warranty for repair being that it's only 8 months old and I was told they couldn't do that because ""It's on another system""??? WTF does that mean???Don't buy this camcorder or any JVC camcorder.I'm only giving it 2 stars because its a decent price but youre better off with a canon or sony."
2,Eerdman's missed the mark on this book...,"They could have published a book that would have been a tremendous comfort to lay readers. Unfortunately, Hart's academic language is maddening--there are words here that will not be in your dictionary, and you will have to re-read parts several times to understand what the author is saying.I would guess that most readers will give up before finishing the book. That's too bad, because Hart has important things to say. Some of the other reviewers seem to cherish his obscurity. I don't. It IS possible to present important, even complicated, ideas in an elegant way that can be also be readily understood.To prospective buyers: skip the book and find the Wall Street Journal column. It's much more to the point. To the author: please read ""Simple and Direct"" by Jacques Barzun."
4,A tough but worthwhile read,"""The Doors of the Sea"" subtitled, ""Where Was God in the Tsunami?"" It's written by an Eastern Orthodox theologian, David Bentley Hart. And it's a fine work that demands careful reading. I read and then re-read it. It is short (109 pages), lyrical and literary.The title tells it all. Hart's book is an expansion of an op ed piece he wrote entitled ""Tremors of Doubt: What Kind of a God Would Allow a Deadly Tsunami?"" that was published in the Wall Street Journal, on the last day of the year in 2004.As a couple of other reviewers have noted, Hart can be obscure at times, but persistence with this book will pay dividends,The title ""The Doors of the Sea"" is a loose reference to Job, chapter 38."
3,"Well Written, but Needless Apologetics.","This short nearly poetically well written book makes for interesting and thoughtful reading. The author discusses various natural disasters (""acts of God"") including the 1753 Lisbon flood, Voltaire's response, and many more horrific historical episodes, concluding with the recent tsusami in Indonesia..since then, events in Burma and China, among many others, have also occurred. The problem of evil in God's realm is nicely analysed. However, the standard condemnations of atheists and agnostics who do no go along with theodicy apologetics are there in full force. Therefore, though the book is worth reading, it addresses only those who are part of the choir, and from a scientific standpoint leaves much to be desired."
2,The Doors of The Sea,Our church read and discussed this book. It was very difficult to read with so many words that we had to look up in the dictionary. It seemed to be un nessary to have so many words difficult for all of us to understand. THis took away from the meaning of the book and so it didn't result it much understand what the author was trying to say. Fortunately our priest did try and explain some of the meaning so we did come out with some conclusion.
4,Bought used and in excellent shape,"I don't normally buy used stuff from someone I don't know. This supplier was dead spot on in his description. The Folk Years product itself was a little surprise because it is folk ""years"" not all folk music. We liked it all, but if you're looking for folk music exclusively, this is not it."
2,I'm not sold on this collection,"Yeah, a lot is here, but somehow the tunes come off as trite and over-produced. You have to really like folk-rock to appreciate this collection. I was looking more for a Weavers kind of approach and I was disappointed. Just by reading the song/artist list, I should have seen that this wasn't what I wanted. However, if you want folk-rock, then this is for you. They don't miss many of the big hits and the sound is excellent."
1,Different than pictured.,"Well, everyone else seemed to have gotten a different product than what I got. Mine was not red oak, nor white oak, or any oak I could recognize. Its way too light for its size, and came with the silly handle wrap gimmik (which was NOT pictured.) The product pictured was not the product delivered. The entire lenghth of the thing is covered in knots, and although sanded down, leave serious weak spots in the wood. The product I got is not fit for any kind of contact, and is too wide for good suburi. Forza fans will be happy with this boken, however, since they do not have to preform with them. Next time, I will not try to 'save a buck' and go with the lowest bidder. Its my fault for having done so to begin with."
2,Bokken was cracked,The bokken was cracked under the cord around the handle. Although not seen until the cord was removed (as is done in all the dojos I have visited) this makes the bokken unusable for me.However it was cheap and in the sense of getting what you pay for I guess it's worth two stars.
5,the c.d is extraordinary,hi. I am Soleil.The album has a great variety of songs and tunes. All the musicians have a unique style of playing and singing. I would suggest the C.D. because it is totally different than any other type of production. It was put together very well.
2,Very Superficial,"This is a very simple introduction to computers in medicine geared to an undergraduate student who knows how to turn a computer on, and not much more. It does deal with information technology, but at such a superficial level as to be useless to anyone already in medicine. Indeed at a couple of points in the text it addresses the reader as ""future healthcare professional"". If you are a current healthcare professional trying to bring medicine into the 21st century, this book is not for you. It will not help you understand EHR's, e-prescribing, networks or true security concerns."
4,Thinking too much,"Two complaints.One major, one minor.The minor one is that the index is terrible to the point to being unusable. Literally nothing is listed in its logical place.The major one is that this is not a Graduate text. It's comprehensive in the shallow, walking-along-the-coastline kind of way. Nothing is described in depth, which is fine for topics that don't have any (like, say, linear algebra), but not fine for Galois theory (the section on which is atrocious) or Representation theory (which isn't covered very well, even for finite groups).The strength of this book is that it covers many topic and in a nonstandard, more natural (to me anyway) way. That's about it."
2,Not good for a course in Algebra,"This, in my opinion is a terrible book for a year sequence in graduate algebra. First and foremost, the exposition is terrible. He frequently leaves out non-trivial details which makes the text hard to work through. Also, does not spend enough time working through the complexities of group, field or ring theory. Those are almost an after thought to him. Although I appreciate his examples that show that algebra is not a self-contained field, that is more for a topics class not a two semester graduate sequence. Also, the index, which is one of the most important features of a graduate text book, is terrible."
1,uninspired and mistitled,This is mainly an uninspired rehash ofundergraduate algebra. With all the textsalready on the market this one doesn't offer muchin the way of novelty. Additionally there areoccasional infelicities in the translationfrom russian.
4,Best ever raw lyrics,Guitar talent is quite amazing. The lyrics tug at one's heart.Want another CD from this artist.
3,Disappointing,"I was so excited to see another title in the McDuff series, a beloved set of books in our house. Unfortunately, Rosemary Wells has not stayed with her original illustrator. One look at the pictures and I didn't even want to buy this book. It's too bad. We'll stick with the 2 sets of the rest of the McDuff books."
1,Do not buy! Misleading product!,"I am a beginner of Arduino programming who was just looking for a simple yet durable Servo Motor on Amazon.I was very skeptical when I searched for ""Servo"" on Amazon and stumbled on this page which showed a picture of a full Servo Motor.There were no comments on this page, so let me be the first to warn you that this product is junk!The product shipped quickly and I was very exited, but when it arrived, there was only a couple screws, springs, and bolts. There was no Servo motor or anything. This is very misleading, and I will never buy from this manufacturer again.Just waster a total of $6 for shipping and handling for a piece of crap.Here is a note to the vendor: If you sell a product, then make sure you put an ACTUAL PHOTO of the product! You do not have a valid description or specification of what this product does, or you don't even specify the name of this product!I say to all customers who look on this page: DO NOT BUY!"
1,Missing Hardware,"It's not that I really hate this item, but it's aggravating that the ""installation hardware"" was carelessly left out of the box, or fell out during transit: The box arrived looking like it had been run over. I'd like to request the missing hardware, but can't find any such contact on the entire Amazon site. Yeah I know - I could improvise with my own installation hardware, but it would probably look kinda sloppy. Boo to that."
4,RSVP International Knife Holder,"I am very pleased with this 10"" magnetic kniofe holder. It is small enought to fit the space where I wanted it placed and strong enough to hold my five favorite knives. Also easy to attach.."
5,Solid,"Solid additon to my kitchen - heavyweight and perfectly sized to fit on the side of a cabinet. Thankfully, no issues with the contact points (as mentioned in other reviews), all are aligned and knife holds well. Looks good, too!"
1,Manufacturing defects plague this holder,"I've used other magnetic knife bars before and have NEVER had this problem.I ordered 3 of the RSVP 10"" magnetic knife holders. On all three of them, there were severe manufacturing defects that prevent the four magnetic bars from lining up with one another. If the bars don't line up, the knife isn't supported well on the wall, often only held by 2 of the bars instead of four. This results in the knife being barely held to the wall.I hoped that it was a problem with just one or two of them, so I ordered three total. All of them were bad, some of them were worse than others.Terrible knife bar. I suggest a different model!I'm returning mine..."
4,Great Magnetic Knife Holder,Nice construction and the magnets are strong enough to easily hold four or five heavy knives. The only thing I could knock is the screws that are included. The heads easily stripped out when mounted to hardwood.
5,Darn!,"When I got this I couldn't find one of these anywhere, and I looked. Now that I have it, I am hooked. It is just the right size to fit on the outside side of the cabinet, making it easy to reach but also saves on wall space. The magnets are strong and easy to use. Mine is near my sink, so they can go right up there when washing dishes to save the fingers from folks being too lazy to walk across the floor to my under the cabinet butcher block one."
1,Poorly made,"The one we received the magnets were slightly angled and also not level with each other. Because of this is the knife can only ever be touching one magnet, not both like it should. Since it's only holding onto one it's not very secure and knives came off too easily."
4,They work well.,I like these to keep the knives orderly and out of the way. The only problem is that the magnets seem not very level with one another so the knife is only being held by one of the magnets. This hasn't been a big deal so far and nothing has yet to fall so all is good.
4,"10"" Magnetic Knife Holder review","Great service and quick delivery. This was the only 10"" knife holder I found. My only complaint is the magnet can be a little stronger. Very happy with product."
3,Good but not great,"Our $10 IKEA version works better, but we got this one because we needed something shorter. The reason the IKEA version is better is because the whole magnetic surface is in contact with the blade, there are no pieces or places that don't touch so you get better contact and a better hold (safer). This one couldn't hold some of our bigger chef's knives in place so we ended up pulling the magnets from the IKEA version and super gluing them onto this one. Now it works like it should.If we didn't need the smaller version, I would not use or recommend this product."
5,A great character study,"""Nothing But a Drifter"" is the perfect summary title for this book. Brian, our drifter, stumbles upon a father and daughter struggling to free a bull from mire and amidst his efforts to help, finds himself as hired hand on a small ranch.Brian is convinced to stay on a spell to guide Sam Pearsons' boys during the next season. Sam and Hildys' daughter, Laurie, is being courted by a local rancher (Frank Hunter) with a bad attitude and vibe. Brian and Frank Hunter suspect each other, and as the herds are gathered and joined for a community drive, a battle for both the Forked P and the heart of Laurie begins.Lee Hoffman was a spectacular writer with numerous awards and novels to her credit. Her skill at creating sympathetic characters and inclusion of ranch knowledge is remarkable. While not as smooth as Johnny Boggs, her style is rugged, just like the character of Brian whose growth we witness in this book.Highly enjoyable fiction from a master of the genre."
5,Works great!,"I agree with the other reviewer. I'm a big fan of the Ecover products, especially the non-chlorine bleach powder and this rinse aid which works great and is better for the environment."
5,Works great!,"I was very pleased with this product. I think my glasses and dishes look better than when I used typical name brands. I am going to keep using this product. I'm happy it doesn't harm the environment, either. I've been trying to switch products from typical name brands in the grocery store to those that don't harm the environment (and buying in bulk). So far, I haven't been disappointed! Including with this purchase. I definitely recommend this product."
1,Useless,I got these sunglasses One good thing delivery was good and fast. Glasses was biggest disappointment you cannot wear them in sun because they doesn't block the sun they are just light yellow glasses. You can buy 10 times better glasses that fits and suits you better in walmart for half the price.
4,A scary book - preschool style,"Preschoolers will love to explore the ""dark, dark house"" with the four brave mice. They'll also love the rhyme and references to colors. The text is brief to match the attention span of young children. The opening illustrations foreshadow the ending; preschoolers might not notice the first time through, but when they do notice, they'll be delighted. Best of all, the beast is scary, but not TOO scary."
2,yawn.,"This album is the end of ADD N TO (x).It pretty much shows us that, w/ the content.Some of the songs are ok, the album is listenable, but it just really isn't ADD N TO (X). I usually think of ADD N TO (X) as a live rock band. This is all super overdubbed, recorded in 3 different studios. Most of the songs don't even have all the members on it. Most of the songs are done by Steve Claydon. I think I like Ann's tracks the best.The songs are also very more modern sounding, almost 80's electro sounding...."
3,Did I Do Something Wrong???,"Being a guy, I figured a pan is pan, you can cook anything in it. I cooked Teriyaki chicken at 350 degrees, the pan has stains and a garlic odor that won't come out not matter how many times I've washed it. Maybe it's only for cakes and such (?). I will still use it, hoping the odor doesn't affect the food. Can someone tell me if I messed up? I gave it a three, since if it is only for cakes, it should mention that for us clueless men out there. Maybe I should've waited till my wife got home from visiting her mom before I ordered this."
2,C.D.,This was an okay CD. I expected it to be more of the well known romantic love making type songs.
5,Never heard him b4 - but now I'm hooked!,"Just put this in the player, press play and walk away. You will not need to come back to forward through any of these tracks.This album is worth every penny. The quality in the music, backing harmonies and Sizzla's lyrics are all 1st class!I'm looking for more Sizzla now, because I know this CD will be played a LOT in the next few weeks. Buy it - you will not regret it."
3,Could have been a little better,"I like Sizzla but this album only had about 4 or 5 good tracks. I find him at his best when he uses his ""dancehall"" voice. Its more gritty. When he sings its ok for some songs but not for majority. With that I still consider him one of the best artist out there."
5,Sizzla is sick,"This album is SO FUN to listen to. Sizzla constantly entertains with something different and fresh. Why Should I, Simplicity, Got It Right Here and Bless Up are among the many great tunes. I've had it for a year and I still listen to it weekly."
1,Not my Speed,"I'm not sure what I expected, but I found this CD to be a huge disappointment. Sizzla is an acquired taste, and I haven't acquired the taste buds yet."
5,Sizzla is back on the Right Track.,"This is what I've Been waiting for a real album by Sizzla. This CD is entittled Da real thing and indeed it is. Here he is in a smoother, mellower vibe. All the songs on this album are perfect. Once again I have to commend Bobby Digital for his great production on this album. sizzla is at his best here. My favorite tracks are Simplicity, Thank u Mamma, Woman I need you, Why should I?, Just one of those days, She's loving and Boom & go through. Please buy this CD you won't be disappointed.Beautiful music,One love!"
5,Always the Best,"Gray's is pretty much the standard in study of human anatomy and this is just another edition of the same book that has been in print for 150 years. Of course this current version is up to date complete with some of the best illustrations that any anatomy book could offer you. Really there is not too much more to say on this, but I think every household should have a copy of at least one of the editions of this book on their bookshelf."
2,Gray's 40th Edition,"The new organization of this former gold standard of anatomy texts makes it a poor idea for people wanting to use an anatomy text for anatomy information. And the on-line info has been designed so that all of the diagrams and drawings are useless, ie. too small to be seen much less uploaded."
3,GRAY'S ANATOMY,that's new edition (39) is diferent of the 37. in this new edition the anatomy is broached in chapters of topografical anatomy and not sistemic anatomy. Topografical anatomy is most interesting for a medicine.
5,great book,"Since I was little boy, I have been drinking coke. I always curious about the coca-cola; who invented this mysterious drink, what kind of stuff in it, how the coca-cola company people promote it to the world. This book gives you answer everything which you ever wonder. Drink coke and read this book! Both refresh your brain."
5,Excellent !,I brought this pack for $8 from circuitcity including taxes. It was a nice deal. I wrote all the 25 DVDs with data and all came out very well. I highly recommend this product.
2,Give This One A Pass,"If you're interested in supply chain management issues or e-business, you won't find much here. It's mostly a rehash of the other Mercer Consulting Book, The Profit Zone. Very general in nature, there's not much new material here. Read The Profit Zone and leave this one in the bin."
5,Great Book,My friend had hit upon on this book and recommended me to read this book. I found this book providing great insights into the world of changing supply chain management and how internet is creating value for the customers and breaking down the costs in the supply chain.
3,Read only.,"Posting Customer Reviews is a two-step process. First, complete the form below and click ""Preview your Review."" Then, we will show you how your comments will appear online. When you're ready to submit them, click the ""Submit your Review"" button on the bottom of the page"
2,A bit disappointing,"Compared to LP London and LP Paris I read and have been early this year, I'm a bit disppointed with LP Bangkok. Although it has an amazing section on food/noodles, I'm rather disappointed that the book does not clearly direct and describe to readers how to get to the places/famous spots it suggested!!!! Also the book does not include a map on the Bangkok transit system - making public transit commuting difficult!!!"
5,Ride Down Happy Trails!,"This CD takes the listener on a pleasure ride down memory lane. Whether reminiscent of the Old West, or dominated by romance, humor or inspiration, all of its melodies are enjoyable. This is a great CD for all lifelong Saddle Pals."
3,No able to hear music,"Since the product doesn't provide any instructions I have to give 3 stars. The product looks very good but I have not been able to listen my downloads, music and audiobooks, in the car. Does anyone knows where I should set the stereo to hear my music? Thanks"
3,"Disappointed with Weaver, but it's not a $500 scope","Very shallow eye-relief window. If your eye isn't in exactly the right place you see a small and/or displaced field. Maybe you get what you pay for. Would be OK for slow-fire, bench-rest shooting."
3,"A Second Helping of Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt and the Great Dolly Parton in the Trio II Album","You may skip all other songs in this collection, but you can not let the beauty and enchantment of After the Gold Rush scape you. Harris', Ronstadt's and Parton's voices are gold by themselves, but they are even more special together. In After the Gold Rush they produce an etherial aura."
1,Don't Spend $1000 for a high-tech paper weight,I bought this camera before I found out that Opra put it on her recommend buy list. This caused all of the sheep that follow her to rush out and max out their credit cards on the camera causing a shortage of the cameras and more importantly the mini-discs that you need to use it! If you are buying it for the holidays - forget about it! Go for the Hitachi - Some places are selling them for cost and this is their thrid generation version vs first for Sony. I bought the Sony becuase of the hype of the better lense - which - unless you are professional I'm not sure you are going to noitce the difference.I'm going to take advantage of my 30 day guarentee and dump this thing back on their counters.
4,Beware Other DVD brands,"Although I really enjoy my camcorder, I have learned that only Sony DVDs work well with this camcorder. You are able to record on other cheaper brands, however, if you use the Image Mixer sofware (which comes with the camcorder) to edit abd re-burn DVDs there are compatability problems between other brands. Furthermore, the Image Mixer software is limited, elementary and not user friendly. Their customer support is pretty worthless as well. I would still reccommend this camcorder - but beware that some editing and recording features will only work with the expensive Sony DVDs."
1,No media for recording,Seems like a nice product but I have been to 5 electronic stores to get the mini DVD's and no one has them. They are not even available on Sony's website so if all you have is the one non-rewriteable disc they include with the camera and you can't get any other discs - what's the use of having an expensive camcorder that you can't record with?
5,"Keep life simple, buy this camcorder","If you're starting to go crazy shopping for a digital camcorder, read on. Bundles of format types, odles of brands, countless models to choose from, what a mess! The answer is the Sony Handycam 300 (or the 100 or 200 if your budget is tighter). My wife and I have twins and have no time to learn the complexities of digital camcorders and returned a Canon and a JVC camcorder after looking at the owners manual. HOWEVER, we essentially figured out how to use the Sony 300 by just playing with it. The menus and options work pretty much like our DVD player and in less than 30 minutes (after charging the battery) we were filming like crazy, taking pictures and having a great time. And the resulting DVD played perfectly in our home DVD player and looked wonderful.Conclusion, don't get confused by all the critiques saying one camera is too heavy, another is noisy, the next one vibrates too much, blah, blah, blah. Buy a handycam 300 and start making movies."
5,Great Camcorder,"Loved the convenience of Direct DVD-R/RW conversion. It stores 60 minutes of great video quality even in LP Format. Also, It gives very good night shots as well. It can store thousands of 1MP stills right on DVD. It came with ImageMixer Software. Just Install the Drivers and software on PC. It detected the Camcorder via USB Port and stored the Videos in MPEG format on computer. Visual Index feature to view stills and videos from camcorder/TV works great.Cons: It comes with just 1 hr battery. And the 3 inch DVD-R/RW are still costly."
1,"Bought to record new born, but no recording media avaliable!","Watch out before you buy this or any of the other Handycams. At the time I am writing this, no stores have the 1.4GB dvds that they use to record. Even Sony doesn't have them. Make sure you can find a supply of thier recording media before you buy any of these products. I bought the Sony DVD-100 and I am stuck. The Handycam comes with 1 DVD-R so when that is used up your done. Think about this before you purchase a $1,000.00 camcorder that you will be only able to use for 30 mins until more disks are available. A fact I wish I was aware of while I was making my decision to purchase it."
4,"Basic, some tolerance issues","Park is a solid tool for wrenching your bikes. This is a good tool and nicely made due to laser cutting opposed to some of the cast versions of past and some other import brands. BUT, some of those old Park versions held tighter tolerances. This new one is somewhat within spec and slightly oversized at .25mm. As an FYI, if you have headsets that are undersized these difference can translate into the wrenches leaving marks on the aluminum parts.Good tools that will last a lifetime."
2,Poor 15mm pedal wrench,"The headset wrench may be fine, but the 15mm pedal wrench was weak, got stripped on first use and I only got one pedal off (yes I know how pedals work and I wasn't threading them the wrong way). Frustrating."
5,Gets the job done,I got this so I could tighten my bottom bracket without having to remove the cranks. It is thin enough to fit in the gap between the front cassette and the bottom bracket to allow tightening.
5,Lessons From the Masters,Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen are absolute masters of focus. In the Power of Focus they share all of steps to making your dreams come true in a simple and easy to understand format. They are living proof that what they teach works!
1,what a joke,"If you're Homer Simpson, this is a good book for you. The advice is so incredibly obvious, most people have figured out this stuff by age 10. Work hard, exercise and live a balanced life? Duh!"
3,Where are my goal worksheets?,"Great inspirational book to help you set goals and begin to take control in all areas of your life (even with fun and relaxation). But, the book itself is a bit wordy...and too long. How about a shortend version on setting goals with a FEW inspirational messages, leaving the last 100 pages empty worksheet plans for us to fill in? The best help books for me are those that I can read and then put to practical use."
2,Don't expect too much,"The 2-star rating may be a bit unfair but I had to give contrast to those tenths of enthusiastic reviews. After having read about 30 ""success books"" I picked up this one and I must say it's neither terribly bad nor very good. I expected much more from the 5-star reviews... Also, I agree that tips like ""hire a PA"" may be good for SOME people but most of us have to do the homework themselves. I believe that people at the top who could afford that army of specialists are already familiar with 99% of the tips provided in the book and for the rest all those ""mastermind groups"", ""achievers programs"" etc. are not a good start."
1,I Threw This Book In the Trash,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. Aside from stating the obvious (Focus is important) the authors frequently recommend ""hiring a personal assistant"" to do the stuff you aren't good at or don't like. How out of touch can they be? After reading such recommendations and restatements of the obvious many times I literally threw this book across the room into the trash."
2,The Focus is on separating you from your money,"This book has a some great ideas (hire assistants for everything mundane, so you have time to be brilliant) for brilliant and rich people.Unfortunately, like most of us, I have yet to find anything I'm brilliant at. And, I cant afford personal trainers, life coaches, tax specialists, and especially my own Personal Mastermind Group. If I could, I wouldnt need this book's advice.With one exception (thats how it earned 2 stars instead of one), the ideas in this book are kinda useless for normal people. In addition, I was disappointed by the lack of real life experiences that I saw in Canfields early works, and I think maybe he ran out of stories. Didnt find this book to be compelling or enjoyable.Conclusion: Title should read 'Sell Books on Focus and Get Rich!'"
2,not THAT kind of focus,"As a long-time ADD patient, I bought this book thinking it would give me suggestions on how to discipline my mind to focus when I want to space out. The reviews were positive and the descriptions/excerpts seemed great. In the end it is one of those ""set goals and get motivated"" self help books. Better descriptions could have prevented this. The book itself reads like a poor man's Tony Robbins. I think the font is even the same. What is here has been said better elsewhere."
5,Great book,Great book on habits. My only wish is that they would come out with an audio version. The book is well written and I enjoyed it.
1,Good Thoughts/Bad Writing,"This is a book that contains a treasure of good thoughts and principles and recommendations and yet is so poorly and woodenly written that one feels as if one has just experienced a speech by Al Gore. It's too bad the writing effort didn't match the thinking effort, because the thinking is quite sound."
1,Hocus Pocus - Lost My Focus!,"This book promises a lot but delivers little. I expected so much more from the authors than endless stories that left me sleepy. While some of the ideas are sound, save yourself the money. The Power of Focus has lost its focus!"
4,Great ideas,"It is easy ready, and has good advice and great ideas. My life is already changing , but one has to be committed for the advise to work. Love it"
5,The Complete Picture of Focus,"I love this book. There are many books on setting goals, identifying your purpose, and establishing good habits, but the authors in this one have included additional valuable information that gives a more complete picture. It is an easy read with short chapters that give you brief punches of great information. There are exericises at the end of the chapters that allow you to put into action the information provided in the book. This is a great addition to your self-help library."
5,Used daily....,Very well made and useful. Goes into dishwasher. Stores easily. Would make a great gift for anyone's kitchen. I would recommend.
5,Teacher's Grade: A-,"I love reading this book aloud to my 2nd grade students. There is abundant humor, a lot of action, and excellent dialogue. The kids especially love the disgusting giant with flatulence issues, and the fire-breathing dragon.This is an excellent springboard into reading for reluctant but capable boy readers."
5,An Awesomely Great Book for Kids,"This book is interesting because it is funny and weird. The reason is Joe and his friends go back in time to the Middle Ages. Then they have to find their way home. I think you should read this because it is so exciting. In one part, a giant is tricked into a big fight with a dragon. This battle saved a castle. Be sure to read this book."
5,An excellent series for kids and their parents.,My son...was given this book by his aunt who works in a library. I had never heard of the Time Warp Trio before that. This book is just right for him. It's not too long to be overwhelming but long enough to be challenging. The kids in the book act in a realistic manner and aren't overly heroic or too goody goody. The book was both interesting and funny and a real pleasure to read with my son. We also have a few others in the series now. This book is perfect for the kid who has outgrown Little Critter and Dr. Seuss but is not quite ready for Harry Potter.
3,You would think it was the authors fifth not first......,"You knew this was the authors first book, but you felt far into the story while reading....which made it good...I would like to read more books by this author."
3,Knights of the Kitchen Table,"Samantha M. wrote:The story has too many ugly pictures that freak me out. And it was boring pictures too. It had too many problems in the book. Like there was a knight who wants to kill the kids. Then there was a dragon who still want to kill the kids named Sam, Fred, and Joe.The story is about these three boys named Sam, Fred, and Joe who went in time. Joe got a book that his uncle got him. I will recommend this book to my friends that like fighting and knights."
4,Celine's best work,"Although I've always been a Celine Dion fan, only two of her previous albums I find excellent (Falling into You, All the Way). Well, let me tell you this is one of Celine's best works, if not the best. Songs like ""I'm Alive"", ""When the Wrong One loves you Right"",""A New Day has Come(radio edit)"" and ""Ten Days"" have a great tempo. On the other side, ""The Greatest Reward"", ""Have you ever been in Love"" and ""I Surrender"" are three of the most beautiful songs Celine has ever recorded. Acrtually, this record gets 4 1/2 stars if it wasn't that the 2 bonus songs are not included in the cd, but in the dvd. I would have put those and instead eliminated ""Nature Boy"", ""At Last"" and ""Aun existe Amor"", which are the weakest tracks to me. Buy this album; this is my advice."
5,A Great Voice,"Celine Dion has a great voice that appeals to different generations. Not only did I like the CD, but my granddaughter did too."
1,Kenroy TWIG series chandelier,Waited 6 months for this product from China. Poor quality. Defective electric system. Had to return! Many other companies carry this product. It is not Amazon's fault.
1,Am I hearing this,"Honestly I am a fan of JLO. I am not going to lie. I enjoy her style of dancing. Most people already know that she is not a gifted singer, but she is still able to make music. From her first cd to her last, she has songs that would hurt your ears. I mean they nearly would put you in tears and turn you in a rage. I don't think people have to talk about her in bad ways, but if you view your money as precious, refrain from her cd's. If you like to salsa dance you might find a couple of songs between her cds. Don't be fooled by the cd's that she got, she is still non gifted when it comes to singing on the street and on the block."
5,Good battery for the price,"Not much to say here - it's a battery, it works, and it's cheap. But I need six more words .."
1,Questionable quality,"I purchased a low-cost all-black turtle neck and the price was good. But, given the low quality, the seam along the neck and back started to separate after only 2 washings. I should have spent more money for a better quality product. My advice -- spend the extra few bucks for a better turtle neck!"

2,Not a satisfying CD.,Paige O'Hara has an attractive voice. But this CD doesn't qualify as one you would want to listen to very often. It sounds more like a practice session than the finished product.
2,Disappointing,"Rituals permeate our existence; from our social etiquette rituals to our political rituals. Religion especially is rife with rituals, and the study of rituals and religious belief can be very interesting and engaging. However, this book is not. It falls flat.This academic compilation (A Reader) is disjointed and convoluted. Except for a few articles, very little insight is given to `religious rituals'. The book attempts to cover too much in too little space. Readers would have been better served if the focus was on the rituals of one world religion, not the world of religious belief.""Ritual and Religious Belief"" is the cacophony of sixteen very erudite authors, all singing solos under no ones' direction.Conditionally recommended for academia for upper graduate, graduate levels and scholars, but not for the general reader. 1.5 stars"
1,Don't buy it.,"This mobile is a wind up mobile, so the music only lasts for a very short time. As soon as she was entertained it stopped playing. I went to Walmart and bought a battery operated mobile that was more brightly colored and I didn't have to rewind it every minute. It's pretty, but was not worth the purchase."
1,Don't Buy From Iomega,"This thing is a five pound paperweight. Hotburn Pro software bundled with the product doesn't work. First it kept freezing up, now it doesn't even recognize the burner even though the computer shows both my cd burner and the Quick Touch functioning properly. Tech support is virtually nonexistant, they correspond through e-mail back and forth that get's answered by someone different each time. First they tell you to uninstall any other cd burning software you have on your computer, including Windows Media Player!!! Then when all that fails and you've trashed any possibility of burning anything, they tell you to call a toll number to attempt to resolve the problem. So I either have to pay long distance, or use up my cell phone minutes to maybe solve my problem. Don't waste your money."
1,"Don't buy this product, its total waste of time","I bought this from online store, spent almost 3 days to recordsome dvd , nothing works, you can not copy dvd to dvd if it is a commercial dvd, you have to capture it first, to do that you have to play it and press all menu buttons on the source dvd , after capturing it if you play it , the quality is bad and I can not play that in my dvd player, I can play that only in computer , its total waster of my time, returing it with 15% restocking fee ..."
1,not a great choice as an external CD drive for a laptop,I have a Toshiba tablet PC that came with an external CD drive. When that drive failed I thought I would step up to DVD burning with this Iomega unit. Unfortunately the Iomega drive isn't recognized by Windows even as a plain vanilla CD reader. So you can't load the software from the CD-ROM included with the machine. Nor can you download drivers from Iomega's Web site because they claim that no drivers are needed for Windows XP. So basically you can't use this as a CD-ROM drive except on a computer that already has a working CD-ROM drive. The drive is actually about the same size and weight as the Toshiba tablet PC!
3,FEEL CONFUSED,"FOR SOME REASON I'M HAVING TROUBLE DECIDING WHETHER I LIKED THIS BOOK OR NOT. I WOULD PROBABLY GIVE IT A 3 1/2 STARS, BUT .....THIS BOOK LEFT ME WITH TOO MANY QUESTIONS WITH NO ANSWERS."
3,My 2nd reading,"I first read ""Passage"" in 1975. I was 27 years younger, and it seemed full of irrelevent facts and figures. I recently finished reading it for a 2nd time and was deeply moved by the author's perceptions. I am disappointed with the American public for not taking more interest in the Armenian genocides, which history proves happened. The Jewish Holocaust is widely recognized because it was perpetrated by ""European white males"", while the Armenian genocides are dismissed because they were perpetrated by ""middle eastern muslims"". ""Passage"" is relevant for Americans to understand to what extremes Muslims will go to in the name of religion."
3,"Its good, but some parts , its boring","Basically, Its about a man who was intersted in learning about his culture, and backround. The cause of his curiousity was why his father kept being an armenian such a mystery."
2,Disappointing...,"I bought this CD, because I have Sonicpraise (their live album) which is ABSOLUTLEY INCREDIBLE. The lead singer, Jeff Deyo brings their music alive with his passion. So, I popped ""Cry Holy"" into my CD player the other day, and was shocked to hear what kind of music they are singing. First of all, I didn't know that they are a NEW BAND, with NEW MEMBERS... Jeff Deyo isn't there anymore. And I immediatley could tell... because the songs are sung without any heart or soul, flat and passion-less. I am so disappointed, and as the other reviewer said, they should change their name, because by releasing an album under the name of ""Sonicflood"" (just because one member of the old band is still there) they have a HIGH BAR TO MEET, and they did not. The expectations definitley overdid this album... I'm so sorry, too."
4,good cd,I feel that this is a good cd and everyone is a little harsh to judge this group. Yes they are not as good or sold like the sonicflood with the old members. But this is still a good group with some great songs. Holy Cry and Surender are very good songs along with some others on this cd. If this group didn't use the same group name (Sonicflood) I bet they would be getting much better reviews
3,glad we got it,"Im more of a rock music person but sometimes you need easy going contemporary music. good music and sound equalization. I like masculine vocals and he sounds kind of wimpy otherwise I'd give it 4 stars but I respect his fortitude to write christian lyrics unlike many christian bands with crossover lyrics. Ive heard the newer ""this generation"" title and will buy it."
1,Don't waste your money!,Don't waste your money. This group is running out of ideas. If you like Sonicflood stick with their first and best CD. This band had a lot of great ideas. Check out Jeff Deyo the bands former lead singer... a much better cd. Jeff Deyo's cd deserves five stars. Go buy that instead. Thanks
5,Wonderful for all ages!,"I fell in love with Wild Child when reading this to my children... so as soon as I saw Winter Waits, we immediately snapped it up, and was not dissapointed. Lynn Plourde's wonderful wordplay tickles the ears when read aloud, and Greg Couch's beautiful illustrations have many subtle layers to explore and talk over with children. This book is geared mostly towards the beginning reader set: However, being a prospective teacher, I can fully see myself reading Winter Waits and the companion books to a third grade level, for fun a well as to teach them about freestyle poetry, and how words can be used for description (perhaps sparking a budding writer?). I cannot recommend this book enough!"
1,Made in CHINA,The picture is of an American made polished housing but they ship out the red Chinese version.Not a happy customer at all.Will have to wait and see how the tool performsIf not made in America these sellers should be required to make that fact CLEARLY known.
5,Its Great!,This is awesome for the fan of Duran Duran.Its compiled with favorite songs.This arrived in great shape and in the time given to arrived.
5,Just what I ordered,Not much to say other than I ordered Oreck bags and received what I ordered. New as billed and in new unopened packages.
5,Great Buy on Amazon,I just bought a new Oreck vacuum and the Hypo-Allergenic Celoc Filter Bags are so expensive. They were so much cheaper on Amazon and the shipping was free.
5,The right bags at the right price!,The same ones available at the Oreck store for much more!Fastest shipping ever!I will definitely buy from this store again!
1,Bait and switch for lower quality bags,"The picture originally showed the front of the ORECK Hypo-Allergenic bag and now after receiving my order it only shows the back of the same Hypo-Allergenic bag on the same product page. With only the back of the package showing it is harder to tell what is being offered. Though, one can still read the bag information and barcode to see that it is still the original ORECK Hypo-Allergenic bags. This model bag is also green in color and sold at a premium price over the blue ORECK bags.The cheaper blue colored bags are not the hypo-allergenic type. The cheaper bag is what I received.Basically a bait and switch. If I wanted the ""basic"" blue bags I could have ordered them for 2/3 of the cost."
3,Great Quality Bags for $$$,"These are great quality bags. They are big, thick and sturdy. A little tricky putting them on but once you got the hang of it, it's just a snap. Hypo-allergenic until you remove the bag from the vac.It just too expensive. I guess we are paying for Oreck's aggressive advertising. You can go to a local dealer and still pay for an arm and a leg."
5,Excellent Purchase,Product was exactly as advertised. Genuine Oreck bags at a good price. Speedy delivery.
5,Vac Bags,"I was a bit unsure of ordering these bags as being advertised as ""genuine"" due to reading some reviews on other sellers that claimed they had ""genuine"" Oreck bags and sent plain generic type bags. I was very happy that this seller did indeed send original Oreck bags. The price can not be beat compared to buying from an Oreck dealer."
5,heavy duty,heavy duty product that keeps the dirt and dust inside the bag.. affordably priced as well..i would recommend these bags.
5,Genuine Oreck Bags,"Some reviews have stated that they received off-brand bags when ordering this item. That was not my experience.The merchant I was given was EASTVAC (Fulfilled by Amazon.com) and the bags I received where genuine, Oreck brand, Hypo-Allergenic, Type CC, bags. These are the exact bags that are listed on the Oreck.com site for $24.99 (SKU: CCPK8DW).My guess is that one (or more) of the other merchants listed here is selling off-brand products.Those who posted negative reviews should go back to their order, check which merchant was used, and include that in their review."
3,"Looking to buy, but Amaxon's review process is unhelpful","So far as I can tell, there are multiple vendors all linked to this same ""product"", sharing a common set of reviews.Therefore, there is no way for a customer to figure out which of these sellers is actually cheating customers, and which is sending the real deal.Even if you pick a particular vendor, and put the product in your cart, when you click on the product in the cart, you come back to this generic product description, listing a DIFFERENT seller. For example, during my 10 minutes of playing around, sometimes this was listed under ""killdirt"", and other times under ""MoreQualityLessMoney"". Also, the picture associated with the ad keeps changing.So I guess it's just a crap shoot what you will actually get here. Amazon needs to crack down on this, in order to keep satisfied customers."
4,Great Product,I love these vaccum bags. I suffer from alergies and the 3 layer hypo-allergenic bags are wonderful. They keep the dust inside even when you take the bags out for replacement. The bags have a seal mechanism that seals the bag when you remove it from the vaccum cleaner. They are easy to replace.
5,Lovely on the Wall,"This calendar is so full of information. I felt like I just got an issue to a great Witch magazine in the mail! The articles are wonderful, with suggestions, recipes, rituals, and more. The full color pictures are beautiful to look at, and I find they are spiritually stimulating. The Calendar itself is in-line with the 2006 Witch's Date Book, so I don't have to learn different symbols for both. This wall calendar also includes the little facts from history on various days, which I find very interesting. These calendars are definitely helping me along my new path as a Wiccan. I hope they are considering/working on a page-a-day calendar as well."
5,I love this calendar!,"I've gotten this calendar for the last several years, and look forward to getting it each December. It is clear, easy to read, and each month has an interesting article about that month -- its festivals, holy days, or just thoughts on the season. I use it regularly, and recommend it to any Pagans out there who need an attractive wall calendar. Although it's called the Witches' Calendar, that's really a misnomer to me -- it is for more than just the Wiccans among us!"
5,Loved it,A great calendar for any witch! Full of all kinds great information Including where the sabbat's started and the myths behind some of the greatest holidays we celebrate today!
3,Liavek - The Players of Luck,This is the second of five books based in the city of Liavek -- home of wizards and magic. The only problem with getting involved with this series is the books are difficult to find. I hunt for them on auctions and in libraries. They are great short stories.
