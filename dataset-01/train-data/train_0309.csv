3,Good but Spotty,"Like the title of my post implies. Hannibal Lecter is one of the most unforgettable fictional characters I have ever read. However, I found the pace sometimes rather leisurely (I felt like shouting ""get on with it!"" at several points).Also, I wonder if anyone really edited the book for the author. Sometimes, Harris makes a very confusing reference.I also have counted and counted in the scene at the beginning where a shootout takes place, and I only note four people being shot by a particular character and not five as it is later stated.The ending of the book is pleasingly surreal."
4,Harris Does It Again,"I just finished this book last night and I must say that I completely enjoyed it. This book becomes even more interesting as, we are allowed into the mind and past of the infamous Dr. Lecter himself. Harris does a wonderful job of creating people and enviorments that are extremely deatlied and filled with emotion. Some have called this novel, the worst book in the series, but I'd have to disagree with them because, as far as I'm concerned, there isn't a band book in the series. I do hope that Harris might consider writing a new addition to the series, but if this is the last time we hear from the doctor, then it was truly a ""tasty"" experiance."
2,Evil Wins Out or How Hannibal Became the Victim,"I love Harris' work -- all of it. But do him a favor DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. ""Red Dragon/Manhunter"", ""Silence of the Lambs"" were classics -- both book and movie. The 1st 1/2 of Hannibal was looking good with plot twists and characters galore. At some point, I think Harris either sold out or got bored.In his effort to explain the tragedy of Hannibal Lector, Harris tried to make him a hero whilst still carrying fatal and unredeemable flaws. It doesn't work. I wanted to throw the book across the room when I finished.Please Thom, explain to us what you did here.-Mike"
4,demystifying hannibal the cannibal,"I must admit that I couldn't wait to be hypnotized and surprised by Dr. Lectors antics. I was fascinated to read more about Dr. Lector. On the other hand,I felt that the author in giving the reason for his cannibalistic actions left me less reason to be terrified and amazed by this evil creature. I don't think a part of me wanted to really side with him as much as I did. The finale annoyed me. It didn't seem true to the Clarice Starling character. I loved her strength and belief in justice and right in the Silence of the Lambs. She loses some of her illusions and her icons fall here. I couldn't believe that she would change so much in the face of the events that she would become a pretty 'dollface'. I couldn't put this book down even though I was occasionally annoyed and can't wait to see the movie."
1,Hannibal is not up to snuf,"I was terribly disappointed in this book after having considered The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs as two of my favorites. This book was poorly written, including many things more for shock value than for plot value. The characters were poorly developed, with Clarise and Hannibal going in directions that their basic character make-up would never allow. The work changed tenses and styles. One wonders if this wasn't taken out of Mr. Harris's hands and put together by an editorial commitee...that lacked talent."
2,Good Lead Up - to a Big Dissapointment,"This book was great -- up until the last 15 pages.I just finished reading Hannibal yesterday. 90% of the book was great - very exciting, and very well written. Unfortunately, the ending left much to be desired. After reading the book, I definately plan to skip the movie when it comes out, if it ever comes out."
2,I think not.,"How I wanted to like this book. As a Harris fan from Red Dragon days, I hoped for a thrilling, thoughtful, tightly written narrative, starring the fascinating and pitiless Dr. Lecter. Sadly, we have a rather dull exploration of ""taste"" and madness. The ending, moreover, is simply an outrage. It subverts the stern morality which pervaded Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs; this consciousness of right and wrong allowed the reader to accept the horrific violence of Harris' novels. Without this moral center, Hannibal made this reader feel like an accomplice in pointless gore."
2,This is an eagerly-awaited and disappointing sequel.,"Hannibal is the disappointing sequel to its chilling predecessor, The Silence of the Lambs. Clarice Starling, who was charming and vulnerable in the first book, has evolved into a pistol-packin' FBI agent. Dr. Hannibal Lecter, whose psychological acumen seemed able to pierce anyone's armor, has become a globe-trotting cannibal on the loose. The story line is improbable, minor characters are flat, and the book lacks the intrigue and horror of the previous volume. Further, the quality of Harris' writing seems forced. Present tense and sentence fragments are liberally employed to create suspense and an aura of impending doom. This is a difficult technique to maintain, however, and it falls short of the mark in this case. Being an impatient type, this reviewer purchased the book in hardcover. Don't. Hold out for the paperback or simply wait for the inevitable movie"
3,"Story is good, ending is a disappointment.","Of the 3 Hannibal Lecter books, this is one is by far the most bizarre. Part of the charm of reading about Hannibal was the fact that we knew so little about him. In Hannibal, Harris attempts to give some reasoning for Lecter's crimes. In doing so, he creates an ending that is completely out of character for both Clarice and Hannibal. The mutual respect that is discussed in Silence of the Lambs is twisted, and in my opinion, ruined in this sequel.The other characters that Harris throws into this novel are interesting, but they tended to overshadow Hannibal.All in all, Hannibal was a good read until the resolution of the story began. At that point, I began wondering if he was going to end with the cliche ""it was all a dream."""
2,Bummer,"I'd say not to waste your time, however, the ending is soooo bizarre, you should read it to know what I mean. Harris did an incredible job in creating a monster so equally as terrifying as Hannibal, you honestly can't decide which villian is more deserving of death. 3/4 of the book was gripping, but, the Hannibal/Clarice Starling conclusion left me...well, feeling cheated."
1,"THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT!",It was with great anticipation that I read the newest Hannibal Lector book. I've been a fan of the series since Red Dragon...I swear to you that I thought I was reading an Executioner book towards the end. I half expected Agent Starling to come racing into the scene with a Harley Davidson and an M-16. I can't even explain some of the premises of this dime store pulp. Awful. An insulting joke.
2,A tad disappointing ...,"Not only did I read and love Silence of the Lambs but after Isaw the movie I vowed never to see it again because it frightened meso. Needless to say, I too, waited in anticipation for the sequel and was more than disappointed. The book started out catchy and kept my interest for a while. Then it was a little hard to follow when the plot switched to Italy, but that turned out to be okay. Even the ""brain-eating"" storyline in the ending lived up to my Lecter expectations. But about the very end with Hannabal and Clarrice ""hooking up""....all I can say is, ""Mr. Harris, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?"". Therefore, my recommendation is~ do not waste your money on this like I did."
4,Great book.....,"This book is quite different from the movie, and although the movie is dark the book is even more dark. With the third installment of this series, Harris yet again manages to throw us another great story involving Lector and Clarice. The last quarter of the book was a wicked adventure into the mind of Lecter and Clarice that makes everything you thought before about these two characters questionable."
1,HANNIBAL,I enjoyed Silence of the Lambs tremendously and eagerly dove into Hannibal. I was very disappointed! I actually found the book offensive. Harris seemed determined to cram every variety of evil into this book. It felt as if the book was written to titillate a very perverse segment of the population. This seemed most evident in his depiction of the former child molestor turned child tormentor. I found this so distasteful that I refused to lend or donate the book and threw it away - a first for me! If you felt any connection or admiration for Starling you will be further insulted. I can not in any way recommend this book.
2,Only One Word: Disappointing,"I enjoyed the way the book began in it's departure from the 1st two books. But after the introduction of the ""Pazzi"" I was finding myself a little bored and wondered were Starling was. The ending to the ""Italy segment"" was anticlimatic. Starling's intense investigation into Hannibals ""Tastes"" was good, but it makes you wonder shouldn't that have been done all the years he was missing.I can only say one thing about the ending"" AWFUL"". What was Harris thinking?If you find yourself wanting to put it down, go ahead, you will only be wasting more time!!!"
1,The joke was on me,"I waited eagerly for this sequel to come out and am so disappointed. The writing style is difficult to get used to, and Harris jumps from past tense to present tense in his sentence structure. Where were the editors? Characters are boring and I don't even know if I want to finish reading this book. Was Harris in a hurry to meet the deadline? Were the editors afraid to make constructive comments? Did Harris have one martini too many while he was writing? I find myself analyzing Harris instead of Hannibal. This can't be the same person who wrote Silence of the Lambs. Like another reviewer I wonder if he is on a remote beach, counting his money, and laughing his head off while drinking a martini? Dang! I wanted this book to be better. The potential was there. Where were the editors?"
2,"Starts out strong, but the ending is just terrible.","I really like Thoman Harris and like many of his dedicated readers, I awaited the release of this book with great anticipation. I actually stalked the local bookstore waiting for it to come in.I read the book with great anticipation, but when I got to the end I was horrified. The ending is a disaster. The actions of the characters are not in keeping with any rational conclusion.I would return it if I could."
3,"Ending was shocking, disappointing, and totally implausible.","Hollywood take heed!!! ""Hannibal"" the movie will be a box office bust unless the screenplay deviates from the book's boring middle third (Florence travelogue) and an ending that defies 600 pages of character development."
3,Very disappointed,"I was really looking forward to reading the sequel to ""Silence..."", but I was very disappointed when I read it. The author seemed to have the thought ""Just how perverse and grotesque can I make this?"" While that is to be expected in this genre, I felt it was done merely to gross the reader out. I did not feel that it explored the characters nearly as well as ""Silence..."" did. I do not think that the Starling character in ""Silence..."" would have wound up with Lecter, as the poor, pitiful, weak Starling in the sequel. Very disappointed."
1,A THINLY DISGUISED SCREENPLAY,"After being thoroughly intrigued by his two previous novels, I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this one. Harris's writing style resembles a novice: short, choppy sentences, two-sentence paragraphs, and excessive chapters (103 chapters for only 484 pages). The plot development was tedious at times, particularly the numerous pedantic references to Italian art and history, which were not explained to the lay reader. I did enjoy the characterization of Mason Verger (could he more evil than Dr. Lecter?) and the explanation of Lecter's childhood trauma. This novel was not written for readers, it was written for directors, complete with the ending. Let the cameras roll!"
4,il monstro fini de 20th Century,"If anyone has taken a tour of Florence, they would appreciate Harris' cultural travelogue.This is a definite dark ride, a descent into Dante's Inferno with no Beatrice or Virgil as a guide. Perhaps the biggest circle of Hell is not lead by Dr. Hannibal Lecter, but Federal Burreaucrats lead by Willima Jefferson Clinton."
1,Don't waste your money,I expected a great read after Silence of the Lambs but I didn't get it. It was as if another (bad) author ghost wrote this book. The ending of the book is totally implausable. What a disappointment!
4,"I found it fascinating, curious, revolting...","It is entertaining and original, Lector is fascinating and Starling is perfect."
2,Hannibal doesn't come close to previous novels.,"Much will be made of the gory, sinister nature of Hannibal, the violence and the strange, disturbing ending. What concerns me the most is that in previous efforts Harris made the FBI seem as a capable law enforcement agency. In Hannibal the FBI doesn't appear at all. The agency knows Hannibal is back in the U.S. but little is written about attempts to capture him. Further, the manipulation by bureacrats to ruin Starling's career is hamhanded and ludicrous. In short, there are so many plot flaws and holes in this story that it is unenjoyable. One minor peeve: Harris or his editor should know how to spell sizable (no e) and buses as applies to the vehicles, not busses as a kiss. I waited six years for this book. I hope Mr. Harris will use the next six years to return to the good form demonstrated in Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon."
1,ABSOULTE DRIVEL!! Should of waited for the paperback!,"What a mess. Read in one plane flight, and have never been more disapointed with a book!! I waited a long time, am a loyal reader.. and for what?? Don't humanize Lector.. he isn't one! Pure garbage.. give us Clarice's thoughts and motivations likes in Silence. She would never have been so naive as to not see what was happening to her career. The ending. Ridiculous. I am very sad that my poor eyes had to read this."
3,"Good, until you get to the ending.","I also eagerly awaited ""Hannibal."" I greatly enjoyed ""Silence of the Lambs"" movie. However, ""Hannibal"" was my first Harris novel.Harris seems to be a master at psychological suspense.His characters are interesting.The cold blooded, devil, Dr. Hannibal Lecter as always is captivating. I found my self wanting more of the evil Mason Verger.The book kept me spellbound through out the beginning and the middle.Unfortunatley, then came the ending! What happended? It's as if the ending was written by a different author.Harris lost his sense of imagination, intrigue and creative writing. The ending was out of character, for both Dr. Lecter and Clarice Starling ""the warrior.""The end makes no sense and I'm left unsatisfied."
4,Many remarkable elements and a couple of odd choices,"The exposition in Hannibal is a beautiful thing: from the isolated wealth and depravity of one of Lector's victims, to Florence, Italy, and flesh eating pigs, the novel abounds in the craft of description. More so here than in the other two novels, Harris also roots Dr. Lector's behavior, as Clarice describes it, in ""whimsy"" more than psychological disturbance, even though there is plenty of that, too. It's intended to be a funny book, and it is, as it also is horrific, gruesome to an extreme, as would be expected, and truly suspenseful almost throughout. The end? Without giving detail, it seems inconsistent with the rest. My guess is that Harris had a helluva fun time inventing this fiction, from exploring the settings to the inner workings of almost all of the characters. I had a helluva good time, too."
1,Selling the book to the used bookstore today...,"Anticipating and then reading Hannibal was like biting into a luscious, golden puff pastry and then finding it has been filled with Cool-Whip which has gone slightly past the expiration date. The scenes of Lecter in Florence, lurking in his digs like Mephistopheles, were well done, but the book slowly went downhill."
5,LOVED IT,"Creepy book, many weird and disturbing characters. It really makes you think about what your definition of evil truly is. The last three chapters made me smile. It was poetic justice. Ignore the naysayers and read this book!!"
2,"Dry, slow, uneventful...","After hearing much hype about Harris' latest, I gave in to my curiosity and spent the $14 on the book. I would venture to say, that Harris is one of the very few writers whose stories are more compelling in movie form. (Most likely because he will have nothing to do with the script). My advice?...Wait for the movie. I am sure Hollywood can enhance what Harris overlooked and produce another blockbuster hit."
2,DISAPPOINTING !!,"major letdown...highly improbable and the ending is absolutelyasinine. Save your money - or if you must have it, buy mine fortwo-bits. A real pity, too - Harris's previous efforts were real page-turners...this one is just his way of getting a payday."
2,"very, very disappointing sequel",A terribly disappointing effort that in no way measures up to either of its predecessors. Grotesque without being suspenseful. Proves the truth of Arendt's observation about the banality of evil. Save your money.
2,Not credible,"The story is simply unbelieveable, especially the end, as many readers have pointed out. Actually it could easily have been a bit MORE gruesome - why did Hannibal kill the fellow after eating half his brains? Why not just put his skull-top back on and turn him loose (still scrape the plates back into it if he wanted to get his jollies that way)? And there is NOT a large gypsy population in Australia. Clarice is unattractive from beginning to end. Mason Verger is impossible to visualise.I am grateful to the reader from Oxford of 13 August for putting me onto ""Telepath's Dance"" in ""The Man-Kzin Wars."" As he says, a much better ""Beauty and the Beast"" story."
4,Exciting - gripping - tough!!!,"I enjoyed the book very much. Although it was less believable and realistic than Silence of the lambs and Red Dragon, I read to be entertained and boy did it do that!!! It had parts that obviously would be offensive to some faint of heart, but was still one of those stories that are hard to put down. My only problem was that I finished it late one nite and had trouble sleeping for the next several hours!!!"
2,Couldn't continue reading,"As soon as a I got to the part of Hannibel's horrifying experience as a youth, I thought something was up and flipped to the last three pages to find out that Harris lacked real imagination on this sequel. I won't go back and read the rest--I'm too disappointed. Honestly, trying to justify Hannibel and denigrate Starling so the two end up together seems like Harris just wanted this over with. Re-read Hannibel's own thoughts on evil in Silence of the Lambs and realize the character was betrayed in this sequel."
1,waste of time and money,"I bought this purely on the strength of Mr. Harris' previous books. I should have saved my money(and my Sunday). Totally unbelieveable, especially the end. I never cared about any of the characters, too much stuff that just kind of piddled away. I'll bet Harris is laughing all the way to the bank. I wouldn't even recommend this book to BORROW."
2,I could have waited another 10 years for this one!,"Like the rest of the fans of Silence of the Lambs, I eagerly awaited Hannibal. The wait wasn't long enough. The first half of the book was enjoyable; a good read. But once Hannibal was kidnapped I wanted to throw the book across the room. Maybe it would have been too easy for Starling to come out on top, with Hannibal captured and everyone else dead. But at this point I'll take easy over completely unbelievable. I hope Jodie Foster doesn't agree to do this movie. There's no way her Clarice Starling would sell herself out that way."
5,Please,"Come on, how can anyone give this book a one-star rating. This is a fantastic novel. True, this book has a different style from the Red Dragon and the Silence of the Lamb, but i think the readers should be glad about the differences because how can you expect anyone in the novel to be able to anaylse Hannibal Lector, like he did to the previous two killers. If any charactor was able to do this, surely it will destroy the legend of Dr Lector. Beside, this book offered an unprecedent double climaxes.p.s. i like the 'Dinner' scence at the end, it's make my skin crawls but at the same time, it's kind of funny as well."
2,Definitely Different!,"I too must admit a bit of disappointment in a book I have anticipated for years. It was enjoyable enough reading, but deviated so far from the flow of the original stories, I found my interest waning as the story unfolded. The ending was just too much to swallow (no pun intended!)"
3,Reconsideration,"My initial disappointment with the ending has turned to puzzlement. Harris knows the bizarre and exposes his readers to unique and terrible atrocities, as he spins variations of the standard thriller.(The garbage disposal in ""Black Sunday"" is an early example.) Our reaction to the ending measures our ability to think outside the box. Even drugged, is this how Clarice would slip into submission? Is she as strong as we remember or has the Jodie Foster performance made more of Clarice than did Harris? This is not the book we expected but Harris has always surprised us. You will not be able to ignore this installment.The monster is worth contemplating. If Clarice can succumb, would we?"
1,Severely Disappointing,"Add me to the list of people who are sorry they read this book. It was superbly written, as one expects from this author, but I wouldn't recommend it to any except those who enjoy the triumph of evil."
1,Would Rather Give It Zero Stars,"Unfortunately you won't allow zero stars, because that's exactly what this book deserves.Not only does the far-fetched ending ruin this book, but it cheapens Silence of the Lambs as well. Harris turned his back on his characters and his readers."
2,Harris Falls Prey to Hannibal,"Thomas Harris is a very skillful writer who told an insipid story. That is the sole compliment I can muster for his latest effort. I walked away with the distinct impression I had wasted my time reading a book in which the author became so enamored of his own creation (Hannibal) that he let the storyline spin out of control. Note that nothing bad actually happens to Hannibal. Like an evil Brer Rabbit, he is too quick, too clever. As Harris becomes reluctant to harm Hannibal in any way, he turns his pen on Clarice Starling and renders her wanton, silly and superficial -- so much so that she is no longer recognizable as the same character from Silence of the Lambs. I regret to say that as a writer of talent, Harris has slipped several notches in my esteem since his first triumph. I was very disappointed."
5,The ending grows on you,"I found this book very hard to put down. It kept my attention and every so often threw in a twist or two that I didn't see coming which made me want to read even more. I was tempted to turn to the back and read the end to see how it would turn out, but I am glad that I waited. I can't say that I was pleased with the ending at first as I don't think I would have ended it that way, but as the days passed after finishing the book, I grew to enjoy the ending. A more predictable or conventional ending would not have the same impact. I found myself changing my point of view about Dr. Lecter from one of wanting him to get his just desserts to one where I was pulling for him at the end. True skill by Mr. Harris in transforming the audience to root for a monster. With luck there will be another installment of these characters in the not too distant future. I will definetly read and re-read this book again."
1,Daft fairy tale,"Harris's earlier books depicted real killers, drawn from real cases. They took you inside the real world of a particular brand of police work, and the men and women that do it. THAT was what made them good. HANNIBAL has nothing to do with reality at any level. It's a daft, gothic fairy story that flies off into a dreary and lurid realm of fantasy, padded out with a lot of rather unfortunate and han-fisted attempts to portray high culture and sophisticated taste. It just doesn't come off. Maybe Harris is laughing at his readers, but I doubt it. I think he just fell victim to literary pretentions. Well,in so doing, I'm afraid he's only proved that a great novelist he is not, after all. Pity."
4,"Exciting, with a shocking yet different ending.","The book is fast paced, the first chapter jumps in to the story without delay. Harris practically takes your hand and leads you through the lives of Hannibal, Agent Starling and others. The only problem I found wrong with the book was that Hannibal's character was superficial. Although he was not meant to show his feelings, I still thought he needed to show some kind care for something in his little world. Although shocked I was glad with the ending of the story, it was different yet sweet and fulfilling taking in Harris' words."
2,It was twisted,"This was a twisted book. There are no bad guys/good guys in the traditional sense. The characters were not clearly defined. If you liked ""Silence of the Lambs"", skip this one."
1,"Desperate, despicable, desolate","Poor Thomas Harris. Silence of the Lambs was a great book and a hard act to follow. But still, we all hoped.....and he failed us miserably. His embarrassment must be overwhelming. Besides poor writing and a most convoluted story line, Mr. Harris has assailed our intelligence with a most ridiculuous ending -completely unbelievable. I can't remember being so disappointed in a novel. I hope the author takes up a new profession."
2,Very disappointing,"The writing is disjointed and at times difficult to follow. The ending was very predictable and stupid. The last chapter would have been sufficient. The rest was nonsense. Many characters, such as the Margot character, were unnecessary and cluttered up a dumb storyline."
1,It took him 11 years for this?,"Maybe he should have given it another 11 years to work out the atrocious writing. This book is boring and poorly written, and what's up with the ending?! ""RD"" and ""SotL"" were both great, finely-drawn examples of psychological thrillers. ""Hannibal"" is pointless."
2,Good to almost the last chapter!,This book kept me on the edge . However the last chapter was a let down for the whole book. I put my copy in the trash.
1,Disappointing....Painful Even...Don't Bother.,"This book was a big disappointment to me. I usually have a high tolerance for bad writing and giant plot gaps in thrillers. They're beach reads - I'm not expecting Hemmingway. However, this book really pushed the limits of my tolerance. I've enjoyed some of the author's other books, so I expected it to be a fast-paced, nice escape from the daily grind. Instead, I got a painfully slow, unbearably boring tome. Part of the problem is that these characters are familiar to you from his other book (not to mention a good movie adaptation). What they do in this story is not credible - or interesting. Don't buy it just because you liked the first one...better off finding something else."
2,Hannibal,"What a disappointment! It lacks any of the intense physiological horror we had anticipated. Maybe we'd been spoiled by Silence of the Lambs, but this sequal is slow,tedious, far-fetched and seems its only connection to its predecessor is the character's names! Too bad, it had such potential.If it was just any horror book I'd give it a ""C"", but as the sequal to a master...don't bother!"
2,"If you've read anything by Thomas Harris, don't read this.","Then again, if you haven't read anything by Thomas Harris, don't read it either. The first 300 pages or so were delightful. You were allowed, nay, drawn into Hannibal Lectors mind. You saw how he thought, you were shown how he lived. Starling had little to do with the story in the beginning, it centered mostly on Hannibal, and I liked that. Then all of a sudden, it switched courses. And not in a good way. I'm a fan of Thomas Harris, and if you want something good of his to read, try Red Dragon, Black Sunday, and (of course) Silence of the Lambs. Thomas Harris started out with a pretty decent book, but it didn't end that way for some reason. This book tarnishes the characters, all of them. From Barney and Crawford, to Starling and Hannibal. Oh, and I can't believe what happened to John Bringham. I liked him."
3,Great beginning and middle but the ending?,5 stars for the first 80% of the book and 1 star for the last 20% for an unweighted average of 3 stars. The end seemed illogical and contrived and probably anatomically incorrect. Some parts towards the end were totally out of character and difficult to believe. Weirdest ending since the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey (what really happened in the end of that movie anyway?) It appears that the ending was written either to 1) give an O. Henry-like totally unexpected surprise twist; or 2) prepare for the sequel to this book. They will probably have a different ending in the movie anyway - at least I hope so. Why did they change the very good ending of Red Dragon to the mediocre gratuitously violent ending in the movie Manhunter?
2,Terribly disappointing,"After finishing ""Silence"" and ""Red Dragon"" I felt like I should sleep with the lights on. ""Hannibal"" completely lacks that quality. There just is no tension, no palpable sense of menace in this book. That's the biggest let-down.And the ending? Clarice deserved better."
5,Thomas Harris Defines The Psyco/Horror Story,"Hannibal is a novel with suspense, action, and complex plot. The two previous novels centered on FBI profilers with Dr. Lector as an interesting side theme - i.e. they dealt with more or less normal human beings. The focus of this novel is the abnormal human being.For us ""normal"" beings, it requires a careful reading with an open mind. The reader is rewarded with a consistent plot that has more than its share of excitement and human depravity."
1,Very disappointing,The strength and fascination of the Lecter and Starling characters disappear into oblivion. The story just fades to gray and lacks all credibility. Even the humor is trite. If I'd skipped the ending I wouldn't have missed a thing.
2,Great until the last few chapters.,"I really enjoyed this book until the last few chapters. What was that all about? I kind of liked the idea of Ledter having Krendler for dinner since I hated him from the beginning, but since when can someone talk to others while a part of their body is removed? That whole sequence at Lecter's home was really bizzarre. I actually found myself laughing out loud during the dinner with Krendler sequence. The ending was one of the worst ending I have ever read in my life, and I think that if Hannibal is made into a film, it will do a great dishonor to its predecessor ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Overall, I was disappointed, but mainly because of the last few chapters."
2,"Promising, but in the end....","The first 200 pages are really great--I was on the edge of my seat. However, from that point on I just felt that the situations and reactions of the characters grew increasingly unbelievable until the ending which left me sitting with a 'yeah right' expression.I've heard Jodie Foster passed on the film. after reading the last 100 pages, I know why."
1,A Previously Good Author Crashes And Burns,"This book epitomizes all that is wrong in our current culture. Poor plotting, the ""sensation"" of mutilation, cannibalism. murder, and sadism all dressed up with dashes of gourmet information, psychiatric BS, and gratuitous horror. The ending is so ridiculous and so morally repugnant that it offends us in every area of our humanity: physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual. The terrible pity is that this author CAN write (I enjoyed every one of his previous books) but chose to turn into a literary Maplethorpe with ""Hannibal."" Don't waste your time or money."
3,I expected more after 11 years,"After the masterpiece that was Silence of the Lambs, I was going nuts waiting for Morbidity of the Soul/Hannibal to come out. Needless to say, I got it the day it came out and finished it within the week.The book is VERY good, but pales in comparison to SOTL and makes you wonder what took so long for this book to get written. Harris tells a very interesting story that lacks the verbal duels b/t Starling and Lechter in SOTL and the last 40 or so pages are a letdown in my opion (others I've talked with loved the ending).If you are a fan of Red Dragon and SOTL, you have to read this book and it's well worth your time. If you haven't read them....read them first then tackle this book."
4,Suspense almost as sharp as the infamous insicors.,"A trip through the vast chambers of Lecters mind. You can feel his breath on your neck, his elegance and manners in every encounter. ""Hannibal"" lets us see the side to Lecter we dare to discover. Human suffering and emotions. Excellent read, intelligent writing, simply mesmerizing."
2,A classic gone awry,"This is as bad as it gets. This follow-up to the classic, superbly written ""Red Dragon"" and the brilliant ""The Silence of the Lambs"" falls unbelievably and painfully flat. This book is regrettably almost excrutiating to read for anyone other than the most ardent Harris fan.An extraordinarily plodding and boring narrative and one of the most implausible and lurid plots that I have ever had the misfortune of reading.I cast my copy of this God-awful book to the swines. I don't even think that swine that haven't been fed for three days would read this drivel.Do yourself a favor and save your money; don't buy this book. Re-read ""Red Dragon"" and once again remember what an extraordinarily beguiling and engrossing experience reading can be."
3,I wanted more,"This much anticipated sequel to Silence of the Lambs is somewhat disappointing and pales in comparison to its predecesor. It is slow to start and once it does get moving, it becomes somewhat predictable. This piece is interesting in its switch of roles and the methods used to possibly change the reader's original alliances, but takes the reader down an unlikely path which is too shallowly explored.In all, Hannibal is a good read and a fair sequel to Silence of the Lambs, but if given the opportunity to speak with the author I would ask that he truly finish this story. Maybe another sequel?...."
1,Please don't waste your money!,"Not recommended!!!I cannot begin to tell you what a dissapointment this was. First, the entire book needed at least two more editings. Even had I enjoyed the plot (which was gastly in and of itself), the writing was attrocious! (As a previous critic said, you could easily begin at the back and simply remove pages at random!)I fear that like Stephen King, Thomas Harris has also decided to forego any real attempt at writing well and to simply slap his name on trash labeled as horror (read horrible) fiction!Alas...another author stricken from my reading list!"
5,No wonder it took Harris 11 years to write this!,"Harris surprised me. I didn't think there was anything too shocking left, but I was wrong. In retrospect, it's hard to imagine that anyone could overshadow Hannibal in his sociopathy but this is truly a macabre Cinderella ending to a nightmare."
2,I want a refund!,"A very disappointing book! The book starts off fast-paced. Then it stops and crawls along with the most boring narrative. I felt no suspense, tingles up the spine, or chills of any kind. Unlike ""Silence of the Lambs"".Thomas Harris has been away for seven years - presumably to write this book. One would have hoped that he would have taken the time to sharpen his skills and bring more of an edge to ""Hannibal"". Maybe Harris was hoping that we would not miss the edge because of his previous works. I, for one, wished that I could start all over again with ""Black Sunday"" and come to this point. I think I will."
2,Fast-Paced with a let-down ending.,"I considered myself a Thomas Harris fan until I finished reading Hannibal. I thoroughly enjoyed both The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. I must have romanticized Clarice Starling's and Hannibal Lecter's characters because they were unrecognizable in this, the newest book. The plot was beyond far-fetched! Trust your judgement. When it starts to seem a little odd, please know its going to get worse! I also disliked the character Mason Verger-the veggie with attitude! Nothing in the story seemed to gel. All elements of the story seem to chafe against each other. The one good thing about the book was the pace. It is very quick reading but when you get to the end you may wish you hadn't. Harris does leave an opening for yet another episode in the Clarice Starling saga. Let's just hope that Harris' heart is into it the next time!"
1,Was this book written in half an hour??,"Who were these characters? These were not the same individuals that were in Silence of the Lambs. I was greatly disappointed that Thomas Harris felt the need to use violence for just shock value, as I thought the previous story had much expansive value. The ending of this book was unbelievable. Unbelievable, but not in a good way, a better word would be stupid. Can someone please tell me how to get my money back? This book is more than a waste of time; it actually decreased my intelligence.Did anyone notice that the picture on the back of the jacket bore a striking resemblance to the description of Dr. Lecter? Would you say over identifying with your character?"
2,OK but not worthy of the attention it has been given.,"This was a disappointment. Although Hannibel Lecter is such a complex character, I didn't need to have Italian poetry included as part of the text. I thought this was pretentious. Also, the detailing of the vintages and foods was almost pornographic in its detail,as was the brutal descriptions of the dispatching of the victims. Also, Clarice's character did not seem fully developed. There were too many references back to The Silence of the Lambs. I think this would have been much better if it stood on its own. Unfortunately, I now feel exploited for having read it."
1,A complete letdown,"Thomas Harris' ""Hannibal"" is not one of the worst books I have ever read - but it's close. I thought ""The Red Dragon"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" were well written and entertaining, but ""Hannibal"" was a joke. Mr. Harris used so much gore that instead of being disturbing, it was funny. And the ending was ludicrous! If Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins have signed to do the movie, they must not have read the book yet."
2,Entertaining but unbelievable..,"I knew this book wasn't very good when I found myself laughing out loud at the ""scary"" parts. I will admit that I had never read a Harris books before, however, I am sure that this was not one of his best. I read quickly through the long and uneccessary descritions, hoping that eventually I would reach ""the good part."" Unfortunately, this never happened. I give this book two stars for it's entertainment value. It is easy to read and even has some laughs in it (even if the author did not intend it that way.) As for this becoming a movie..well, lets just say that I would go to the cheap show."
1,Clammy and hammy,"Overwrought, pretentious, boring, pointless. I hope Mr. Harris gets tired of writing again and stays away for another decade. Please!"
2,wait for the paperback...or check it out at the library,"i read the whole book it three days...disappointing, but better than what's on TV. i found the ending ridiculous, because i'd honestly expected more from starling. again, a male writer who ""doesn't get it"" when it comes to writing women."
1,TERRIBLE ENDING !!,"Wish I hadn't wasted my time getting to the end of this BORING book. The ending ruined ""Silence of the Lambs"" for me. I refuse to recommend this book to anyone."
2,"Characters and content not up to ""hype"", disappointment","After the wait, this book is such a disappointment. Hannible isn't as evil as he should be. Harris has made Clarice a weak pitiful person, and he has done the same to Jack Crawford. Granted, the new evil person Mason Verger, is a good villian. But, after waiting so long for this sequel, I am so disappointed I could cry. Please don't make a movie of THIS book. I have read Silence of the Lambs twice, seen the movie three times and will watch it again. But, I will never recommend this book to anyone. I regret spending the money for a hardcover, wish I would have waited for a ""used book"" sale."
2,"450 pages of absolute brilliance, 25 pages of absurdity.","It did take me a while to get into this one, as it seemed most readers. Once into it, I thought Harris' dedication to the theme, and charecteristics of Lecter were brilliant. The portion of the book in Italy was somewhat overwhelming, involving too many details and language, which the average reader is unable to absorb. The book, did however keep me involved until the final two chapters. The ending, however, was absolutely rediculous, and made me regret reading the previous 450 pages."
2,"disappointing, implausible and will make lots of bucks...","Amazing what you can get away with when you become a big-name author...a first time novelist would be lucky to even collect a rejection slip for this one. With the exception of Hannibal, the characters are reduced to cliches...poor Clarice, superwoman downtrodden by the male establishment. But that's what it takes to sell books today. The ending is ludicrous, it can't be explained, so Harris doesn't bother."
2,A very disappointing conclusion to the Hannibal trilogy,"I bought this book before it was released. I was as excited about this release almost as much as Episode I of Star Wars. But unlike that film, I was extremely disappointed by the results. A very gothic and boring tale about nothing. I was hoping for an exciting story of Clarice Starling and her hunt for the escaped killer Hannibal Lecter. Instead, it is a long, drawn out glimpse into Lecter's appreciation for life (ironic) and a new evil character that is trying to avenge his being condemned to a wheelchair by Lecter; I don't care about this new character. I wanted to read about the people that I have read about in the previous novels. There were some exciting scenes (the opening FBI raid and Lecter's escape from Italy) but that's it. Please do not make a movie. I don't want to relive the book."
2,The sickest thing I ever read... and I HATED it!,"Now, I like sick stuff, and Silence of the Lambs and all that stuff he wrote just gives me the creeps. But this one sucked, 100%. For example, there is a part where Jody Foster ends up eating someone because of what happens to her. She should be in the movie, but on top of that her character would just not do it. Never. And it made me nearly vomit. Really."
4,Eeeek!! The ending totally blew my mind!!,"This was one wild wrap up; the ending was totally unexpected, totally creepy, and totally fitting. You have to read this, but it will haunt you."
1,Literary KITSCH,"I just finished reading Hannibal and it it's idiotic. The book is the exact opposite of the movie. The book wants to talk about a very cultivated man and a strong woman but all it does is kitsch them! Mischa is A stupid idea! the cultural references to Dante don't link H and Clarice. For Dante, Betrice means divine revelation, much like ""If you love me you'd stop"" in the movie. if you want to understand h and c watch a hybrid hannibal starring a.h. and jodie foster. Thomas harris should read more and then write. I'd be ashamed to produce sth like this, at least in front of my characters..."
2,What a book this could have been.,"Judging by the cover I thought this book was going to be good, but then I started reading it. There was this whole title page thing which really was kind of a letdown as it was mostly just a repeat of the cover without the picture. The chapters list was somewhat more promising but kind of left me feeling empty after that I just kind of lost interest."
1,"anti-christian, anti-jesus book","This book is a definite attack on the christian values of jesus. It makes the villian the good person -- just like those who persecuted our savior jesus thought of themselves. it is a direct slam against our beloved jesus and christiantity and part of the liberal media's cultural war against us. imagine, making a ""cannibal"" who eats human flesh for pleasure intoa hero! jesus would be crying if he had read this book."
2,The Ending Ruin the Book for Me,"I only read this book because I was intrigued about all the gossip surrounding the movie and how the movie was changed. I wanted to read the book to see how it actually ended. It was a total disappointment. The Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs and the Clarice Starling written in Hannibal are two total different characteracters. Now I see why Jodie Foster didn't do the movie.One thing that I did enjoy about the book is that I found the movie was very close to the book, except the ending."
4,Woah!!!!,Hannibal is one of the greatest novels I've ever read. It kept me goin' until the end. I could'nt put it down. The ending was the most unnexpected one ever. The auther gives such good details of everything (including each fatality). Really a well writen book. It would be good for anyone who likes susspense
4,"Grisly, but fun to chew on.","I more than liked this sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"", although I must admit no one I've talked to rated it with more than two stars. In this book the reader finally got to know Dr. Lecter, and strangely,I liked him very much. He is mad (crazy), yes, but brilliant, funny, and, as we discover, capable of love. Most people can't understand how Clarice Starling could love Hannibal Lecter, but he is, afterall, the man who risked his life to save her. Jodi Foster doesn't want to play Clarice in the movie because Clarice ""doesn't stay true to her character."" I disagree. Clarice never fit in with the FBI. Maybe Dr. Lecter is the only man as smart as she is."
3,Great book to read,"This is about a woman named Clarice Starling and her life working as a FBI officer. Clarice is the best FBI officer there ever was in Washington. Here she will face the biggest challenge of her life. First she must get out of trouble she is already in after a drug bust. Now she must meet a cannibal. She met this person once before and will face him again. She met him a long time ago and put him in prison for a while. His name was Dr. Hannibal Lector.I do like this book, because it fits me, well short of. It is an action packed book with some grouse, bloody scenes. I saw the movie to this book before. This book as well as the movie contains a lot of action right from the start of the book.. The reason why I didn't like this book is because it does contain some romance and some old time stuff or past history tings as some of us will put it.This is a good book for most of you people out there."
1,Probably one of the worst books ever written.,"Hannibal is a just plain lousy book. Thomas Harris appears to be mocking his loyal readers by giving them a poorly constructed plot and a ludicrous ending. Perhaps that is why he has not written a book in over ten years. He spends more time in telling us about Italian Renaissance History as relating to the Italian cop and what pigs can do to a poor soul than framing a concise narrative.The villains are boring and Hannibal himself appears at times to be a good guy. As for the future of Clarice Starling, the book makes me totally uninterested in her fate."
4,Over the top,"The reason I'm giving HANNIBAL 4 stars is because middling Harris is better than 95% of what the rest of us write, but that said, this book does not live up to RED DRAGON or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I think of this work as overripe Lecter. Less is more, but in this book we get way too much. The plotting is over the top, and villain Mason Verger is beyond belief. What made the preceding books work was that you actually believed that these fantastic events could really happen. HANNIBAL is more like a fairy tale. You go along with it but you know it could never be real, and so the story often feels more silly than scary. But if you, like me, are a Hannibal Lecter freak, don't pass this one up. If nothing else, the good doctor's recipes will give you a chortle."
2,The long wait resulted in a slap in the face.,"This is one of the most disappointing books that I have ever read. Hannibal Lecter is merely a shell of his former self and Clarice Starling is a lame pawn in the goings on of men. I will give Harris credit for Mason Verger. Verger was brilliantly disgusting! On the whole though, the story was quite lame as far as thrillers go. After years of waiting for the next Harris book I felt extremely flat at the end. The ending was absolutely absurd. Hopefully we've seen the last of Hannibal and Clarice."
1,Very easy to put down and forget,"Dull characters, obscenely unreal plot line, and, dare I say?, BORING. A huge dissapointment. Throwing in a few obscure literary and culinary references does not make for an intelligent book, when the characters are one-dimensional and the writing is stilted and dry. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this over-hyped drivel."
1,Where's The Excitement?,"What a disappointment. It was difficult to read the book because of its boring, non-substantive plot. The characters never developed nor did any level of excitement. Too much time is spent on non-important events and the build up to the plot seems as though it takes an eternity.Technical textbooks are an easier read than this lemon."
2,Hannibal is too mellow for a serial killer,"I was truly diappointed by Hannibal. It starts out wonderfully,with Clarice Starling right in the middle of more FBI action. Butthen, Harris takes the story to Florence. It loses steam from there and the end is completely unbelievable."
4,"spellbinding, but unsatisfactory at the end","i revel at Harris' ability to make the reader feel sypathetic for Hannibal. He truly is a monster, but i was rooting for him all the way through. interesting that both mason and hannibal have younger sisters, but it is the very ""monster""-Hannibal, who is tender and loving toward his sister even after her horrible death, whereas mason abused his sister and enjoyed watching her suffer. There are lots of interesting parallels in this book. The part with the dinner did make me slightly urpy, but made me cheer at the same time. the only dim spot is the end. It leaves the reader unsatisfied, almost like having dinner and no dessert. other than that a most addicting an enjoyable read."
2,The monkey is off his back...,"I didn't read ""Silence of the Lambs"", nor the first part of this trilogy. I was only familiar with it via the films, which captured a perfectly horrifying set of images. I am now fully prepared to hand over all of that credit to the filmmakers. After reading ""Hannibal"" I can only assume that Thomas Harris is happier than I am. With this book he can finally put an end to the ""when's the sequel"" question that has popped up for years. It seems as though that was the sole purpose to this book, to end a series as ridiculously as possible as to guarantee no demands for a new installment. Yes, at times you are sufficiently spooked, and yes also, you spend far too much time reading about entrails. In the last act, you can almost imagine Harris at the keyboard clickly madly as he tries to come up with the most outlandish and absurd finale. I do hope that this truly is the last we see of Hannibal."
3,"Not ""Lambs,"" but pretty good...","The first 400 pages are well-written and captivating. The last hundred or so border on ridiculous. Still, worth a read."
2,"Very disappointing, needed another edit","I'm not sure what disappoints me more, the book, or the good reveiws, most notably Mr. King's. Erasing the line between popular fiction and literature? Give me a break. This book was horribly written. The author changed from present tense to past tense at every whim within the same paragraph. And the senator's name was spelled different in various parts of the book. Ridiculous. Did no one proofread this? As to the story, there was no suspense, just the gruesome details that a writer of Harris' obvious ability needn't have stooped to. I have my doubts that he even wrote this. Although I enjoyed the book as I would a cheap horror flick, I can scarcely recommend it. And I agree with those who didn't care for the ending. Totally absurd and random and should have stayed in the author's deleted files."
2,Not worth the trouble,"I found this book to be predictable and disjointed. Harris should let an editor work with him since he constantly interrupts the flow of the story with psycho-babble. The method of Mason Verger's revenge is totally unbelievable. Anyone with a brain in their head would not be surprised at the ending. Since the two main characters seem very happy at the end, I can only hope there is no possibility of another Hannibal Lecter novel."
2,GOOD SOAP OPERA BAD HARRIS,"This book does not have the suspenseful plotting or naratative drive of the two other books in this seris.Red Dragon was better than TSOL but, both books used Lecter as a foil to balance the disturbing natures of the two seemingly normal protagonists. Verger, used in that capacity in Hannibal was unrealistic. As a soap opera to flesh out the characters from TSOL this book is somewhat interesting. A prequel showing how Graham initially caught Lecter would have been far more entertaining.This is the first hardcover fiction book I've bought in years ,I will not make this mistake again."
1,UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTING!,"I just finished reading this book yesterday and felt that I had to let you all know how bad this book is. I had such high hopes for it when it came out as I loved ""Silence of the Lambs."" However after reading it - I wish that I hadn't wasted my time. Most of the characters are disappointingly flat (especially Starling) and the ending is a complete joke. Harris has spent too much time describing the scenery and not enough time developing the plot. It seems like he wrote this in order to cash in from the success of the previous book. I FEEL ROBBED! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
1,Childish,"After reading, enjoying and evangelising Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, this is a huge disappointment. The characterisation plumbs new depths of childishness, the plot (killer pigs) is contrived and the ending just simply beggars the belief that the previous two novels instilled you with that 'this could actually be happening'. Thomas Harris should go away, take stock and reconsider his abilities. Just writing what you can does not a good novel make. It's not a thriller, it's not suspenseful, it's not worth it."
1,Jodi was right,"Upon hearing Jodi Foster wanted nothing to do with the next Hannibal movie, I was initally disappointed. Then I read the book. Where is the Harris who thrilled me through Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs? After shooting this dog full of holes, I am afraid to re-read those classics, fearing I might find fault with them. Have I become more sophisticated, or has Harris sold out? I fear the latter. The premise was unconvincing and contrived. I specifically requested this book as a gift and would like to publicly ask her forgiveness for money wasted!"
5,"Super Macabre, Super Delicious","If you like really morbid, sublimely written fiction this is it. It makes Silence of the Lambs look like child's story. A unique reading experience. One of the few books that I will probably read again."
2,"""Hannibal"" a disappointment","And it started out so interesting! But by the end, Hannibal seemed way out of character, and Clarice wasn't the same Clarice from Silence of the Lambs. I was disappointed by the ending. Not nearly as good as Harris' other works."
1,What a waste of time,"I read Silence of the Lambs in a few days, it kept me so enthrallled. HANNIBAL took over a month to finish. I was so uninterested in it I had to force myself to finish it since I had paid for it! The last part of it was so ridiculous. If I had just waited and gotten it at the library I would have taken it back after a third of the pages."
2,Huge Disappointment,I adored Silence of the Lambs and was quite excited to read Hannibal... it was extremely difficult to get into. SLOW initially. Finally it started to pick up and I was going to keep on giving it a try. I believe that Harris was trying way too hard to outdo his work from Silence of the Lambs. How gross can we make this? How ludicrous can this be? He tried too hard and I feel that it unfortunately was what ruined it. Harris is a quality writer - and it seems to me that he tried too hard to create a new masterpiece rather than writing a good book.
1,Hannibal,"I was very disappointed in this book, I hated the ending, it made Starling out to be a complete idiot. It showed Starling with zero backbone and none of her cleverness from the first book. Hannibal (character) was good and I understood the concept of the entire book, I just think it could have had a different ending."
2,Disappointing,"Readable, but lacking any credibility and deeply disappointing when compared to Red Dragon / Silence of the Lambs."
2,CLARICE WHERE ARE YOU?,"I loved the rich characters in Silence...., but here, Harris basically abandons Clarice and instead creates an atmospheric, gruesome and gothic story around Hannibal himself. What is missing is the resolve and further development of precisely what made these two characters so intriguing in Silence -- their fierce respect for one another, and their implicit ""oppositeness"". We never get what we want in this book, which comes from a completely different angle. For those of you who enjoyed the ending, I could not disagree more -- it has one the most disappointing finales in recent fiction, certainly that involve characters we know. I simply have decided to separate this story from the clarity and near-perfection of Silence..., which is a breed apart."
5,Two words...Thomas Harris,"This is a man who has NEVER written a bad or even mediocre book in his LIFE. What I can't understand is why EVERYONE who reviewed this book mentioned ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and so few mentioned ""Red Dragon"" which is, in my own opinion, Harris' finest work. The Lecter Trilogy, as well as ""Black Sunday"" should be required reading for fans of suspense fiction."
1,"Yeah, baby!","This novel degenerates into an Austin-Powers sort of ending, so ludicrious that it was easy for me to imagine Lecter looking up from his harpsichord and saying, ""Good evening, Clarice. You look so..shagadelic! Rowrrr..oh, behave, you naughty thing!"" Thomas Harris has been a fine novelist up to now. What happened?"
1,"A ""DOG"" RATING, ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH!!","How disappointing! While SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was suspenseful and thought provoking, HANNIBAL is predictable, boring and overly gruesome. The ending...well, it totally goes against what we know about Starling's character. I bought it the minute it came out. No patience! Had I waited even one day, I would have seen the awful reviews."
2,What a disappointment!,"I loved The Silence of the Lambs, and was excited to read Hannibal. I read Lambs right before Hannibal, and I think that Thomas Harris or his editor should have refreshed themselves too! Not fifty pages into the book, he makes a reference to Lambs that is inaccurate! I was stunned, and irritated. The style of Hannibal is totally different from that of The Silence of the Lambs. I think I may have liked this book better if I had never read Lambs. The scenes seem implausable, and is written in a dreamy quality I was not looking for in this novel. Some of the references to pop culture are wrong as well, another editing problem. (It wasn't ""La Macarena"") I don't recommend this book if you loved The Silence of the Lambs and are looking for anything similar. You will be very disappointed. If you go in with no expectations, it's an OK book."
1,Vile. Depraved. Unworthy.,"I thought that Red Dragon was one of the best books of its genre that I had read, and SOTL was, arguably, even better. I can only assume that Hannibal was the author's reaction to the glorification of Hannibal Lecter that followed the movie of SOTL. If so, and Hannibal is indeed a parody of his earlier work, then Harris holds his readers in the ultimate contempt. I came away from this book feeling angry and disgusted (not to mention, cheated). This book has no redeeming qualities, and quite apart from its basic depravity, it's a big waste of time. It is sick, and my advice to the author is: ""seek professional help"". By the way, Australian coins come in the following denominations: 5cents, 10, 20, 50, $1, and $2."
2,Extremely Disappointing,"Thomas Harris couldn't have had a better chance of another hit, but boy did he certainly blow it. The strong characters he built in Silence of the Lambs were changed dramatically. What scared me so in the first book was that the plot could be somewhat plausible. Again, Harris destroyed this possibility especially with his ridiculous ending. I wound up kicking myself for spending time reading the book."
1,Less than one star,"Harris revealed himself at last in this stinker of a self-parody. It shows he has nothing but contempt for his readers. Anyone can go to the library and search back issues of The Wine Spectator, Cuisine Magazine and Fodor's Italy and come up with enough obscure references to truffles and wine to sound erudite to the unwashed masses. This book was not a thriller. It contained no thrill. Harris just filled 484 pages with his self gratification fantasies dressed up like trailer trash at the opera."
2,disappointing-disturbing,"After SOTL and RD, to say I feel let down is a ludicrous understatement. Is the purpose of this book expressed in the first paragraph of chapter 20?"
2,"airplane fodder, nothing more","I usually try not to spread bad vibes -- what's the point, really? -- but so much great stuff was written about this one on its jacket that I have to vent my disappointment somewhere.When characters are rendered vibrantly, you can ""hear"" who's talking without the author having to say it. Here, even with Harris telling you, the voices -- save Lecter -- are indistinguishable on any but the most superficial (and artificial) level.Every character is a caricature of type. It's expected to have its monsters of course, but a disfigured ""Christian"" who makes underpriveleged children cry and then swabs their tears to add to his martinis? Puh-leeez...No worse, but certainly no better, than a lot of others."
2,A MONSTER DISAPPOINTMENT,"Waiting 11 years for a sequel to one of my favorite books was hard enough... when the sequel is poor it's like a slap in the face. HANNIBAL is a bad book. I can't think of a single complimentary thing to say about this novel... isn't Thomas Harris a thriller writer? This book is without thrills. It turns the greatest villain of the century into a hero, and then drops him into a bad James Bondish plot (cybernetic pedophile without a face conspires to use pigs to eat off Lector's feet?!?) Endless Italy travelogue, Starling wasted, no Will Graham, needless lesbian mayhem...This should have been the greatest book of the decade, instead it was a bitter pill to swallow. I wasn't asking for the world, just a good, satisfying read. I can't even believe it's the same author."
1,Disappointing,"Sometimes you read a book because you love the style of the writer and see what he/she has to offer. I really wanted to see what happened to Clarice and Hannibal. Unfortunately, I found the style of Harris' writing to be very disappointing. He has replaced an ""edge of the seat"" style with a over the top and extraordinarily unnecessarily grossness that ends up bringing attention to him, rather than his characters. On many occasions I could not help think ""why has Harris written this in this manner"". The only reason why I finished this book is that it gave me something to read on the train on the way to work, and in the hope that Harris' style would get better. Unfortunately it didn't. I'm surprised his publishers let this through. I will be very less interested in reading anything more that Harris writes. There are much better deserving writers out there that deserve sales rather than this ... ."
1,Give me strength!,"If the movie script is true to the book, no wonder Jodie Foster turned it down. The edge-of-your-seat psychological suspense we've come to expect from Mr. Harris' previous works was conspicuous by its absence, the violence was gratuitous, and the ending was ludicrous. Borrow the book if you must, but don't pay money for it."
1,pretentious twaddle,"Hannibal Lecter is Thomas Harris. Page after page Harris displays his vulgarity. Describing paintings,clothes,food,books and buildings - the lifestyle of the rich and famous. And to crap it all our middle aged 'hero' gets to give the lovely Clarice a good seeing to. Wishful thinking Mr. Harris ? This book should be re-titled 'My Favourite Things' and is not worth stealing."
2,Let's write a new ending...,"because this one was VERY disappointing. While the bulk of novel was well-written and intriguing in its plot, it leads to an ending that will at first confuse you based on its style, then on how Harris thought he could get away with such a menial performance. It doesn't fit the rest of the book, series, and ESPECIALLY the characters.BOO HISS!"
2,A macabre feast,"Very disappointing. And Mr. Harris allows himself the privilege to REPEAT himself (comparing the Palazzo della Signoria to a Halloween pumpkin TWICE).And the final ""feast"" is really far-fetched: I wonder how it will look on the film-to-come. Hope Ms. Foster stays away from it. henry caraso, paris"
3,untrue to character,"I had anticipated a great escape, wonderful story, great character development. I was sorely disappointed. Although the author writes an intriguing story with bizarre and surprising twists, I can't believe that Starling could turn 180 degrees changing from a young woman of high ideals and integrity to an unprincipled person who would form a relationship with a monster. I was appalled."
2,Rather disappointing...,"After reading this book, my immediate impression was that Mr. Harris wrote what he thought people wanted. I suspect he was under intense pressure to write a sequel and finally succumbed. While not a bad read, Hannibal is so over the top that it's impossible (for me) to replay the events of the book in my mind without laughing. Hannibal Lector is no longer compellingly crazy, now he is just whacked. The ending isn't plausible, and by then you've stopped caring about Clarice and especially Dr. Lector. To me it would be VERY difficult to top Silence, this book proves it."
1,Great letdown from RD and SOTL.,"I just read through Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs very quickly to set-up reading Hannibal. The first 2 books were incredible, I was intense in starting to read Hannibal. Unfortunately, I have hardly ever been so disappointed. The book worked for me until the final forth. From there it took on the ridiculous, and the ending was a huge, huge letdown. Absurb. I hope Tom Harris mercifully ends this story with Hannibal."
2,Disappointment,"I agree with what many of the other reviewers stated; the ending is neither believable nor logical. It is one thing for two people to have an immediate passion for each other despite other differences. But the development of anything else between Lecter and Starling is ridiculous and was never set up appropriately. I suspect in the 4th installment, which I won't bother reading, the author will explain that Starling was merely brainwashed and will find her way morally and bring down the evil doctor, thus lining Harris' pocket with another book. And are we supposed to believe that because of what happened to Meisha that Hannibal's existence is justified? He doesn't merely killer truly evil people, he kills his enemies which are not always bad people (like the guards in Silence). The story with Mason Verger is good but the Lone Ranger save by Starling is foolhardy. Thumbs Down."
2,The third but not the best,"Sorry folks. Just about every reviewer in the U.K hated the third in the series and for once I'm inclined to agree. 'Red Dragon' scared the pants off me, 'Silence of the Lambs' showed what a really good Author Robert Harris can be but 'Hannibal' just wasn't up to the job. I suppose the ending was the clincher. Without giving too much away it was in a word 'preposterous'. It's a word that no-one uses much these days. Maybe if Robert Harris writes some more novels it may come back into the English language."
1,Waste of time,"This was a horrible , boring, unsatisfying,book. The ending was totally out of character and ridiculous. DO NOT READ THIS !!!!!!"
2,Still waiting for the climax........,"Naturally, after reading TSOTL my expectations were very high. However, despite Harris' brilliant penmanship it NEVER satisfied me. Various descriptions are world-class, but the book as a whole is very dissapointing. I do NOT understand the end, just tell me why - someone please! One of the worst endings I have ever read - I just couldn't believe it."
2,What went wrong?,"It's as if something happened to throw Harris from his game approximately 3/4 of the way through the book. The first half was wonderful -- drew you in, kept you wondering, made you read one more page... and another... and another... until you realized you were way overdue for whatever it is that called you.The ending is laughable, it's so contrived and rushed. With ""chapters"" containing only 4-5 paragraphs near the end, and such a lack of detail (not restraint, but HOLES), I have to say I wish I'd simply never read it, because the magic that Harris has been able to conjure before now seems utterly ruined."
2,Not what I expected,"I anxiously awaited Hannibal. I was completely drwn into the dynamic between Lector and Starling in Silence of the Lambs and my return to Harris' work was yearning for moreof it. What I found instead was a story that stretched one's imagination to a breaking point. I find it unsettling that the relationship between Starling and Lector turned into such a disturbing fettish. That goes upstream against anything and everything we learned about her in the Silence. Perhaps if Starling's character played more than an afterthought role in the book, it could have developed into a beleivable scenerio. As it is, the relationship is simply false. I found Hannibal a dissapointing and goulish read."
3,Unbelievable,"I couldn't believe this book. It was so fascinating until the last few chapters. I couldn't put it down, it was so interesting and pretty quickly-paced, too. But then ending was utterly preposterous, and replete with atrocities that were neither scary nor humorous, even in the black-comedy fashion they were meant to be. It was just too twisted and sick to be frightening OR funny. The ending ruined the entire novel, which I had been really enjoying up until that point. Explaining why the character of Lecter was the way he was, interested me, but then to push it SO far over the top and change Starling's character completely, was the author's disastrous mistake, in my opinion. I would have given it five stars but the ending brings it down to 3. Kind of sad and a major disappointment."
5,A really good book,"When I picked this book up at an airport bookstore, I did not have the benefit of reading either Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs previously. Rather, I took at as simply a NYT Best Seller, assuming it would be a good read. Indeed it was. It was worth my time reading it, and I enjoyed doing so. I would recommend that everyone else do the same, before they come out with the movie."
1,Highly over-rated,"I wish Harris never wrote this one. He ridiculed the character, Hannibal Lecter. Moreover, i think Harris isn't a good writer at all. Just by researching on Italy and Behavioural science, he has included many facts but very poor with imagination and creativity. His description of serious and important sequences is poor as well."
2,Lousy Ending,"This book was so anticipated, especially with all the buzz that Anthony Hopkins & Jodie Foster might reprise their roles for a movie based on it. I was very disappointed in the ending which totally changed the characters we know from ""Silence Of The Lambs"" and made them up to be part of a ludicrous finale. A shocker of a book, yes, but for all the wrong reasons. I would not recommend it."
2,High Expectations Were Not Met!,"I couldn't wait for this book to be published! I thoroughly enjoyed all of Thomas Harris's previous novels and I had high expectations for this one. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met. Harris could have done so much with the return of Hannibal - instead he chose to bore us with gruesome details of an implausible story line. And the ending! It was almost offensive - it's as if he took the quickest and shortest route to wrap up the story to meet a deadline.On a positive note, he has a way of bringing the reader into the story with his wonderful landscape descriptions and historical and cultural narratives - they are the only reasons I kept turning the page."
5,It's as good as it ever could have been,"Forget all the hype that surrounds this and its prequels and all the people who expected it to be the best book ever written. This is no masterpiece, but it's a great read, exciting and intelligent. The prose is wonderfully sparse and restrained. The imagery is disturbing. Sure, the ending's like nothing you could have imagined, but what else could Harris have done? Up against the likes of The Bone Collector and Every Dead Thing and even the brilliant Prayers For Rain, Hannibal reads like it is written by THE master of the genre. It's two protagonists are the best characters in contemporary serial killer crime fiction. It reminded me that everyone else writing this kind of stuff is just a pretender to the throne. I hope Mr Harris writes something else before 2005!"
4,I Like It !,"I thought the book was great, I had a problem with the Italian, but other than that I truly enjoyed the book. He was very detailed in his writing. I truly enjoyed it."
1,far too explicit,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one of the most thrilling thrillers I have ever read. So naturally this made me look forward to the sequel Hannibal. Even though the style of writing is still slick, I found the descriptions of what one can do with human beings (dead or alive) way too explicit. Sometimes it is better to leave a little bit to the imagination of the reader."
2,"Not half as good as ""Silence of the Lambs""",Trust me on this one: This is one case where you should skip the book and see the movie instead. Grab yourself some popcorn and go for it.
1,Depressingly Awful,"Mr. Harris still manages to paint wonderful word pictures and his attention to detail amazes and fascinates, but once the climax of this book's plot is reached, the fall is precipitous and treacherous. Mr. Harris betrays the readers' faith in his characters and destroys any semblance of a coherent narrative in the final chapters of this book. It would be a great psychedelic parody, if Mr. Harris didn't seem so sincere in his attempt to fit his circular story into this square ending. Stay away from this if you're fans of the first two Hannibal-related tomes!"
1,This is a good book-- for me to poop on!,"Harris, Harris, what have you done to the characters from ""Silence of the Lamb?"" This book is so bad, taking more time out of my life other than telling you not to waste your time is like pooping on poop!"
4,Great Ending!!,"I am unusual in that I thought the ending was the best part of this book. It was more shocking than any of the earlier, grislier chapters."
3,"So-So, not as edge-of-your-seat as ""Silence of the Lambs""","I finished this book last night, after savoring it over the last week. Unfortunately, it was somewhat predictable and seemed more a vehicle for the gore Lector intimated in Silence. It does give a little of his history to explain his cannibalism but...it's not a satisfying explanation. The end left me disappointed and dismayed. I will say this though, Hannibal is truly ""Il Mostro!""I'm glad I read it but wish I had borrowed it from the library rather than having bought it. That's what I would advise other readers to do - if you really like it after reading it, then buy it to keep, but borrow it first."
2,Disappointing Follow up,I have loved all of Thomas Harris' novels but I was extremely disppointed with Hannibal. The last part of the book was especially disappointing. I usually zip through books but this was a labor to finish. I think Clarice and Dr. Lector deserved a better story. I recommend all of his other books though.
1,Awful! All Shock value no suspense,"So much expectation...so little delivery. The only reason I gave it one star was because no stars was not a selection.This novel had none of the drama, intrigue, or suspense of Harris' other novels. Instead Harris opts for the most shocking characters and events imaginable, each more shocking than the previous. When Harris isn't trying to simply shock the reader it seems as if he's showing off his obviously impressive knowledge of art, culture and cusine.I read 'Slience of the Lambs' in one sitting and have looked forward to this book for years. I am so sorry I ever purchased it.If you have yet to buy this book, Don't!!Borrow it from a friend, or grab it out of the trash, which is where mine went."
3,Left me with the familiar taste of a sequel.,"Sequels to excellent novels often come with high expectations. True to the custom, while I loved ""The Silence of the Lambs"" I thought its sequel did not measure up. Although it was well written with several intriguing moments, ""Hannibal""'s plot did not have the intensity and the ""can't lay it down"" effect I had expected. I also missed the discovery of the main characters' psyche - to be expected from a sequel. Harris gets high marks for the continental and artistic flavors. The ending has an erie resemblance to a popular musical with a twist and is somewhat difficult to swallow. ""Hannibal"" registered on the same scale as the other Harris novels but did not approach its prequel's ranking among my top ten novels."
3,Hannibal Lecter a.k.a. James Bond,"After waiting so many years for a sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"", and with Mr. Harris' glacial writing pace, we could have expected a stronger book.Mr. Harris has changed Dr. Lecter into James Bond. Everthing about him is perfect - looks, mannerisms, taste. He has almost completely masked the monster we have come to fear from previous writings. In order to completely hide Lecter's past, he makes his protagonists as hideous as possible - is this Mason Verger or Dr. No?The book builds to such fevered pace with the final confrontation, then fades to a silly few pages of brainwashing. Such a strong character as Clarice Starling doesn't deserve this.I fully expected the ending to substitute a Bondish ""Ohh James....."" with ""Ohh Hannibal....""."
2,The worst ending in history,"After reaching the end of this book I have decided that I don't care about the money spent on it, I JUST WANT TO GET BACK THE TIME I WASTED READING IT! Let me do something worthwhile with it instead! It's so sad because the first half was good, but as soon as Lecter escaped Florence it completely went downhill. And don't get me started on how weird that whole thing with the pigs was. The ending is so ridiculous - it's as if Thomas Harris (after seven years) suddenly lost interest in his own book and just ended it without regard to whether or not it made sense. What happens to the characters is so out of place that one seriously thinks about just how Harris himself believes it. When they make the movie version I will not see it. Never. I almost threw the book out the window when I finished it I was so disgusted. For shame!"
3,"A violent modern day version of ""Beauty and the Beast""","A tale of two souls who are misunderstood and rejected by their own, who find each other and discover an outlet for their repressed sexual feelings. The only words that were left out and should have been included at the end of this book were ""and they lived happily ever after."""
4,Great story--till it peters out.,"I waited for this book for sooo longgg!!! The first couple of chapters rated 2 stars, the middle part rated 5 stars and the ending rated 1/2 a star. I found it worth reading just for the middle part."
3,Hannibal needs work!,"Mr. Harris is a very good writer in creating the character of Hannibal Lecter, one of the most sinster ever, but his current work pales in comparison to his other twp Hannibal books. The first part of the book is good, but the last half borders on the strange and obsurd. The ending was very contrived and not very original and lacked the punchy ending that Silence had. Mr. Harris could have put some more creativity in the contruction of the free Lecter - who in the second half turns into a weak character and totally unitelligent - a bitting departure from Lecter's cool composure. I only hope when this book is made into a movie that the screenwriter please the second half!"
3,the ending was unsatisfactory.,The book was OK but the ending was disappointing. I agree with another reviewer who said that the Clarice that we knew in Silence of The Lambs would not have given up as easily as this Clarice. The reading by Gerriol was also disappointing. The only character that he did well was Hannibal. So many times an audio version can ruin a great read if the voice at the other end is not plaesing. I anxiously await what Hollywood can do with this story..
2,Harris Meets Felini,"I've enjoyed Harris's books and bought Hannibal as a knee-jerk reaction. Thru three-quarters of the book, I wasn't disappointed. Then, as if Harris got up from the typewriter and Felini sat down, the book simply crumbled from a full grown work into a meaningless satire of Harris' fans being willing to applaude anything with his name on it. The publisher should be ashamed in contributing to the process."
3,Trying too hard,"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect after Silence of the Lambs, but I'm not sure if this was it. On a superficial level, I enjoyed it, but I often got the feeling that Mr Harris was trying too hard to achieve a shock value that wasn't really necessary. More so, his own intellectually driven bitterness shone through very strongly to the point that you often felt that Hannibal - more than being just his own personal anti-hero - was actually a representation of himself.Nevertheless, it is a very well researched book and for me was a good read. The end, however, was a bitter disappointment and totally in conflict with everything that preceded it."
1,Harris has his chance....And blows it.,"Thomas Harris, in his last attempt, gave us not one, but two monsers to contend with: Hannibal Lecter and Jame Gumb. They were monsters because of their minds and their personalities, not their physical appearance. Harris, in both Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon, does not rely on the visceral, slovenly horror found in Hannibal.It feels as though Harris got lazy with his character. Dr. Hannibal Lecter has become like every generic brand bogeyman out there on the market today. Lecter was not scary in SOtL because of what he did - he was scary because of what he could do. Potential can be scarier than actualization, and in this case it holds true. Harris had the chance to deliver a bombshell of a book. Instead this book just bombs. Thankfully I had Deaver's The Bone Collector to wash the taste of Hannibal out of my literary mouth."
2,Grotesque to the point of silliness,"Harris tells a great story, but all the way through I could feel him rubbing his chin and musing, ""What other grotesque absurdity can I put in to turn my readers' stomaches without turning my readers off."" He neither turned my stomach (though he came close) nor turned me off (though he turned me off of the only sympathetic character in the book) though he gravely disappointed me.My recommendation is to see Manhunter, read Red Dragon, then read Silence of the Lambs but don't bother with the movie. Forget about Hannibal the book and the character. Let him vanish into the third world, never to be heard of again, as he did at the end of Silence.... You'll be much happier."
2,THE END IS TERRIBLE,"Well, I couldn't stop reading this book. I would get home and read until I couldn't read anymore.I must say that it was an excellent book...until the end. The end of this book couldn't have been worse if it tried. The rest of the book was wonderful. The characters were well formed and I was wondering how the movie would butcher the excellent book. Now I'm hoping the movie re-writes the end. It's totally unbelievable."
4,"Remember, this is FICTION!","People seem to expect the characters and events in Harris' books to appear real and believable. This is FICTION! They aren't real and neither are the events. Ultimately I think Harris does a good job of telling stories that have the ability to make one's skin crawl and have us looking over our shoulder for whatever spooky reason. I thought ""Hannibal"" got off to a disappointing start, but after the first few chapters I began to enjoy it for exactly the same creepy feelings I got when I read ""Silence of the Lambs."" Hannibal Lecter's character fascinates me because he is so creepy! I admire Harris for conjuring up characters such as Hannibal and Mason Verger, to allow our imaginations to run wild. The ending surprised me, and in fact I had to read the last few pages twice to make sure there wasn't some sublety I might have missed the first time. It definitely leaves room for another sequel!"
1,"Lousy book; however, was really a screenplay anyway!",I listened to this rag on audio. Thomas Harris completely succeeded in his effort ... make lots of money on the movie. Good for him. What really grabbed me was DANIEL GERROLL as the narrator. Now HE is worth listening to ... even if he is reading an insurance policy. His range of expression is amazing. I will definitely look for him on audio books in the future. I would never have finished this as a book ... too unreal ... badly written ... NO ONE could be as smart as Lecter (really an unbelivable character) ... pompous ... wordy. But having listened to it read by Daniel Gerroll salvaged much.
2,A HUGE Disappointment,"I know, I know, how could it possibly have lived up to Silence of the Lambs? But I thought there was a CHANCE. Turns out Hannibal isn't a monster at all, he's one of the good guys, and law enforcement is all on the take. And maybe I missed this, but did Harris only write in sentence fragments before, or is this a new affectation? His sentences begin in the middle, and then drift off, like you are walking into the middle of a conversation that already began. Then just for jollies, every once in a while he shifts into the second person, as though you are standing in the doorway watching all of this unfold and he is inviting you in to participate. And then he jumps back to third person narration.I had heard that Harris would not allow anyone to edit his book, and I believe it. I look forward to the edited version."
5,Bad Bad Hannibal has fun,"This book is a great read. It is a lot of fun. The story is really interesting and fast paced. And there is a happy ending for some of the characters.Clarice is treated really wierd. Her FBI people are setting her up (hint - don't annoy Hannibal), she is after him, he is after her. Hannibal is almost the good guy here."
3,"Hannibal, not as in Missouri no mo'","OK, in previous works we learned that The Cannibal was familiar with such bucolic pastimes as fishing for doodlebugs with a straw and slaughtering those eponymous spring lambs. And the good Dr. showed an uncommon affection toward Little Clare Starling, a bumpkin with a nice handbag. Implication being the big L was from down home somewheres, perhaps a native of Mississippi like the author. But now...oh, lordy. We learn Lecter's some kind of Eastern European aristo, who's got kind of a complex over how those nasty deserters dun et his lil' sister. (Maybe it was just the presentation.) No wonder Ms. Foster bailed on the sequel. Nonetheless, must confess, read every word, so I guess the author's concessions to Hollywood don't totally alienate the fava beans and big chianti crowd. Wonder what this book would have been if Gene Hackman had taken the part in *Silence*."
2,This truly is a horror novel....,"Reading the book, the true horror unfolds when you see where Harris is actually going with the end of the book. The ending is so unbelievable that it makes you go back and recognize the flaws of the rest of the book. Harris was certainly influenced by the success of Silence, and needed to build the book around the heroes of the movie (Hannibal and Clarice). Almost every character is completely unlikeable, and we are supposed to actually root for Hannibal the Cannibal (and understand him). Harris is a gifted writer, and the pace is quick and the book keeps you interested, but ultimately leaves you extremely empty and cheated."
2,A Downward Spiral?,"I was so disappointed with this book, I almost regret reading it.Now, let me step back for a moment. I am a huge Thomas Harris fan. I devoured ""The Red Dragon,"" ran willy-nilly through ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and waited with baited breath for ""Hannibal.""Unfortunately, ""Hannibal"" was a bitter disappointment. The ending was wholly unbelievable and implausible, not to mention borderline gory and grotesque.It seems to me that Harris rushed through ""Hannibal"" in order to satisfy the demands of readers and fans only to produce an inferior novel which left the devoted among us sour.I would hate to think that Harris's talent has been tapped. Hopefully, this is not the beginning of a downward spiral and that Harris has other ""good things"" in store for us."
2,Disappointing!,"This is the first book that I have read from Harris and found that I was very dissappointed. For one thing, I hate excess verbiage, which this book definitely entails. Second, if you are interested in elegance and upper-class lifestyles, which I'm not, then this book is for you since it entails very descriptive intricacies of the upper-class lifestyle. Third, the ending was terrible and completely and ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE, or even thinkable! From what I hear, from friends and other reveiwers is that Red Dragon and Silence of The Lambs are a lot better. So with that in mind I think I'll give these two books a try. As for the Hannibal, I wouldn't give this book a high recommendation to anyone. Sorry but I was definitely disappointed."
4,A beautifully crafted portrait of madmen and women,"This book is unlike anything anyone could have expected, and that is a wonderful thing. Instead of getting the continuing adventures of Clarice, we get a superbly written tale that exposes the horrors and demons of every main character. Plot does take a back seat to description and metaphysic discussion, but the plot is also the jumping point for all of that, so it ends up carrying the story along. I really loved the way this book was written; I could feel the things Harris was writing about, and could imagine myself in these places. This book is not for the weak at heart, or for those who like everything tied up in a neat package at the end. But, for readers willing to view popular characters in a strange new light, and willing to take a satisfying yet strange journey through Mr. Harris' world, the rewards are great, and this will stick with you long after completion."
2,Not up to expectations.,"After Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs I was hoping for the same type of page turner. Hannibal was a good book if you were looking for a psychological dissertation or head shrinking handbook. As a page turner, or as a follow up to Silence of the Lambs, it falls well short."
2,Did we really need this book?,"After Harris wrote Silence of the Lambs I believe his intent was to leave it at that and not write another book. Perhaps it gives everyone comfort to know the outcome of Lector, but I was certainly pleased with the legacy of Lector ending in Silence of the Lambs. This book is unimaginable and just serves as an ending which I think was poor. Otherwise, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs were two great books and I also reccommend Harris's other book, Black Sunday."
5,A kinder gentler Hannibal provides good reading,"""Hannibal"" begins where ""Silence of the Lambs"" ended, with gross horror and a revolting villian. However, it rapidly changes to a much less intense book that entertains and explains. I believe Hopkins and Foster will refuse to do a sequel movie based on this book because of their objections to the ending."
4,Good book but disappointing ending.,"Another Harris cliffhanger is with us. Hannibal is loose and I too found that, once I started reading, I just couldn't put it down. It's Hannibal at his gruesome worst. I was most disappointed by the ending - not at all what I would have expected having read Tom Harris' other books in the Hannibal Lecter series. All in all though, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to all readers of psychological thrillers. Definately not for the faint of heart."
3,Not Up to Par,"I admit that Mr. Harris writes with taste and style, which is well worth reading, but he should have worked longer on his ending.While I admire the majority of the novel, I must insist that the ending is not only absurd, but stupid. It is going to take more than a few hocus-pocus hypnotherapy sessions to turn a person from who they are, to someone not even remotely like who they are. The only way I coud accept that ending is if torture had been involved.Honestly, he should have just let it end with death of Mason Verger, thought about it some more, then wrote the next book. As it stands, any future book of his dealing with Dr. Lecter will go unread in my library."
2,"Brilliant prose, disappointing story","As was said of another thriller writer, Thomas Harris writes like a slumming angel, but Hannibal is a disappointment. Hannibal Lecter was the devil himself in Silence; in this he's just human after all. And what happens to Clarice Starling seems so compeltely out of character, I just didn't believe it. I don't understand why Harris chose the most incredible scenario of all for her. It squandered one of the most believable, finely-drawn characters I've seen in modern fiction and reduced her to a mere Bride of Frankenstein. A letdown for me. And dinner with Hannibal again? No thanks."
3,An intriguing journey into the world of a monster...,"Well, as were most I was disappointed with the ending of Hannibal and found it a little ridiculous even. I tend to agree with those that mentioned it was a clever ploy to keep this story away from hollywood and regain control of his characters. Whatever Harris has decided here it's still hard swallow(bad joke) that ending. I do think some of the complexities of Lecters character were well created and explained but Starling became something she would have never in the world Harris had previously devised for her. All in all, a fun and interesting read but not a Red Dragon or Silence by any means."
2,Please.,"I'm sorry, but this book is not that good. How it can be ranked #1 mystifies me. There are so many other great books to read, Cold Mountain, The Triumph and the Glory, The Reader, The Pilot's Wife, why should anyone try and wade through a half-hearted effort like Hannibal ?"
2,Disappointing,"Great, the Phantom Menace of the printed word. A book with some great ideas, some beautiful prose, but one that fails to satisfy and has, to use a prosaic word, a dumb conclusion. Harris needs a good editor. Harris is a very, very good writer, but he should have resisted the pressure and written something else--not bowing to the moneymen who wanted a sequel to ""Silence."" He must have known--why else did it take him 11 years to produce a sequel?"
3,"Not as scary as RED DRAGON and SILENCE, but still compelling","The third in Harris' Lecter trilogy, HANNIBAL is not up to the quality of the first two novels. More ""yucky"" detail than scary suspense, it was still compelling, if only to see what happened to its two main characters, Hannibal and Clarice. I bought it the day it was published, read it that day, and donated it to my local library; I'm keeping my hardcover copies of his first two books."
5,"Absolutely Riveting, Excellent!","The ending was...incredible, and certainly worth the wait. It caught me completely off guard, and provided a nice conclusion to the whole saga, while leaving the door slightly cracked open for a continuation. Read this book! You won't regret it."
4,fairly good,I still think the Red Dragon is the best of the of the series. I was surprise by the ending. I guess we can look for more from Dr. Lecter and Clarice. Perhaps Mapp or Barney will track them down.
5,Unbelievable!!,I don't understand the bad reviews. This was the best Lecter book clearly. The ending was strange... but it was a great book anyway.
3,Great book for around 90 Chapters!,"I was in the zone, I was sweating, pumped, jazzed, scared, etc.... But then the ending came up and without spoiling it - the ending does an injustice to the character of Clarice Starling and troubles me still a week after putting the book down. There is a movie to be had here and a good one! But for God's sake someone must pen a new conclusion. Makes 2001's ending seem tame....."
1,What a disappointing ending.,"After Red Dragon, which I considered exceptionally well written, and the best of the three, (Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal) about Hannibal Lecter, I was hugely disappointed. While I'm sure that Italy is a fascinating country, I really don't need to read 250 pages of detail I can get from Fodor's...And the ending is really disappointing. I can't believe Harris let's it end that way. What a bummer."
3,"Great start, but bad ending!","I just finished the book and I must say the conclusion was disturbing and unexpected. Harris started out great; the action and suspense was right on target. It was interesting seeing Hannible on the loose; although some of his abilities were at times a little too extraordinary to believe.While I can't discuss the ending too much I will say that, given the past of both characters from the ""Silence of The Lambs"", it did not make since. Part of the problem may have been that Harris put all of his effort into fleshing out the Hannibal character and not enough into Clarice, this might explain the inexplicable ending.Perhaps Harris should have re-read the ""Silence of the Lambs"" to stay on track.If this book were ever made into a feature film the ending will have to be rewritten."
4,"Great Book, Not-So-Great ending","Unlike most Harris fans, I haven't been waiting 11 years for this book. I'm only fifteen,and I read ""Silence of the Lambs"" last year. Still, I was looking forward to this book. I loved it until the last two chapters... I can understand the ending, but I really wish there had been more description of what Clarice was thinking. She went insane, but It was so fast, and out of character, that I had to re-read the chapter again.Except for the ending, I thought it was good. Mason seemed more evil than Lecter, and it was interesting to see some of the landmarks from earlier books so twisted, like the institution. I'm not afraid of Lecter anymore though. I appreciated learning about his history, but now he's too human to fear.Still, I wish there was more explanation for the ending."
2,Ending made me so unhappy I couldn't go to sleep,"I loved Silence of the Lambs (the novel much more than the movie). When I saw ""Hannibal"" staring at me from a bookstore shelf this weekend I grabbed it and headed for my porch swing late Sunday afternoon. While I didn't like the characters as much as I did in SOTL, I did find it a very good book until the last 40 pages or so.I kept thinking that Thomas Harris was really going to have to put a lot in very few pages to explain the Clarice/Hannibal pairing. When he left it that way I sat dumbfounded for several minutes and then started telling a friend the entire plot to see if he was as incredulous as I was over the ending. He was. I went to work today and told everyone I knew that they would want to know how the book ended before they started reading, just in case they felt it wasn't worth the let down at the end!Unless the ending is changed, I can't imagine anyone liking the movie either!"
1,LAME!!! There will NOT be a movie!!!,"Here is another negative review...this is not a 3 star book! I can't understand how people can claim he wrote this solely with a future film in mind....there is no audience for this version of events. Maybe some day another writer can extrapolate beyond what happened in 'Silence of the Lambs' because as far as I'm concerned, HANNIBAL didn't happen! Morbidly entertaining at times, but when compared to the first two books, it really DOES appear that someone else wrote this book."
1,Quit before the end would have been my advise to Harris,A disjointed and poorly flowing work by Thomas Harris could have been saved by a decent ending and used as a setup for the next novel. Instead Harris chooses to show his contempt for fans and characters alike by contriving an ending so unsatisfactory and unlikely that it tarnishes the works that came before. If not skipped entirely this book is best returned to the library before reading the ending. Any ending a reader can make up will be better than the one read.
4,"Fast-paced, exciting","Creatively gory. More cartoonish than previous books in the series, but entertainingly so. This book actually has two climaxes; one is a conventional, action-oriented bloodbath (the film will probably end here), the other is far more macabre and disturbing. I can understand why many readers disliked the end, but I thought it underscored just how unrepentently diabolical Lecter really is."
1,wish i could rate it less than one star,"stupid plot. stupid story. just plain stupid. not to mention gross. after reading sotl i wonder if maybe thomas harris had a stroke, brain fart,or thought hollywood would buy it outright and jody foster, anthony hopkins would buy it--make him a little richer. he played us for fools-no one will pay money to see the movie-especially after money to buy the book. i have thrown the book away incase one of my children should find it."
2,Doesn't even compare to the first.,"I read Silence of the Lambs right before I read Hannibal and because of that I was expecting something remarkable. However, I was thouroughly let down. The book started off with the same tone as the first, but as the book progressed the tone went off track. Another thing that I hated was the enormous change in Clarice. Her mannerisms, attitude, and even her speech changed with no basis for a change whatsoever. Lastly, one thing that made the first so incredible was the limited gore. It was only added when absolutley necessary. In Hannibal, the gore was completely unnecessary and sometimes I couldn't even begin to understand why it was in there. I don't really recommend reading this book, especially if you're a big fan of the first."
4,He pulled it off..,"I began this book with the knowledge that many readers, including professional reviewers, had panned this book. As such, my expectations were not high. I was afraid that this would be a cheap, screenplay sellout, ala The Lost World.This did not happen, as Harris skillfully and believeably (to me, at least) created a satisfying plot and took the characters in new directions. I plowed through the last half of the book in two sittings.I find it interesting that some other readers, who have read this and other Harris novels, criticized this book for being violent, revolting, etc. Of course it is. What do they expect after Dragon and Silence of the Lambs (which made me more uncomfortable than Hannibal)."
1,This book was the worst book I ever forced myself to finish.,I am so glad I forced myself to check this book out of the library rather than buy it. It was beyond awful. I wonder if I can get a refund on the 50 cent holding fee I paid to the library...
1,A severe disappointment,"Harris developed a complex and psychologically powerful dynamic in the previous two novels. HANNIBAL not only fails to deliver on that promise, but proves to be a crude and distasteful parody of the serial killer genre itself. The book isn't even worth reading for curiosity's sake. Save your money."
4,"I enjoyed it, read it straight through, crazy ending!","Great book. Like I said, I read it straight through using every available moment to delve back into it's twisted brilliance. Hannibal Lecter is the Sherlock Holmes of evil. The ending I never expected has left me in shock. I'm still trying to come to terms with this book."
4,Thank You Thomas Harris,"People will be disturbed by the end of this book.But, maybe we are meant to think about the nature of evil. There are plenty of bad guys in this book, and many have understandable motivations. We don't see Lecter attack anyone innocent.And what does it take to catch him?"
5,Better than the previous novels by Harris. Very complete.,"I was blown away by it. I finished the book in two sittings. Lecter teaches this world a valuable lesson. You must read and absorb to understand. I felt content to put down the book in the end, as if I had just dined with the doctor. I feel I am a better person having read the novel. Now I can sleep, and maybe even hear the lambs screaming..."
3,Good until the end...,"I looked forward to this book for the past eight years, ever since I first read the novel and saw the film version of The Silence of the Lambs. I am very disappointed in the direction Mr. Harris decided to take his two main characters. It just doesn't seem to fit them. Of course, I didn't create the characters, so what do I know? I thought the book was engrossing and very entertaining until the last 20 pages or so. This was *not* what I had in mind.... Too bad."
1,Awful and dishonest,"Simple: if Clarice Starling was anything more than a plot devicce, or had any character at all, she wouldn't be so easy to turn into a monster. Compare, even with all her flaws, her strength and character in Silence with the cipher Harris turns her into here. Worse than a waste of time."
3,Good read but disappointing for this Harris fan.,"Harris can't write a bad book, but this one strains my loyalty. ""Lambs"" was horrifying and credible and all of the characters worked. In this sequel, he humanizes Hannibal, writes of sadism without purpose, and fashions a totally unbelievable and hokey finale. What a waste!"
4,GOOD - It keeps you guessing,"I decided to read this book because I loved Silence of the Lambs. Each section of the book kept my interest and I found myself reading late into the night. There were some great scenes admirable for Dr. Hannibal Lector's character... which made me squirm now and then.However, the ending sucks. I wanted more but I found myself disappointed with the conclusion. That is why I only give this book four stars."
3,Perspective,"Alright, so Hannibal is not the best of Thomas Harris. But lets face it, the least of Thomas Harris is better than the best of a whole bunch of others. Cases in point - Tom Clancy and John Grisham whose most recent efforts have produced the next thing to projectile vomiting. Toss in that utter drivel entitled ""I Know This Much is True"" that the dilettantes love so well, and the not-the-best of Harris comes across like a nightingale in flock of crows. As to those who denounce the denouement - get a life. The seeds of mutual respect between Clarice and Hannibal were sown in Silence of the Lambs. She has been pilloried by the organization she served so faithfully, and can anyone deny that many women fall in love with their physicians? More power to you, ex-Agent Starling. May you live happily ever after!"
1,"What a let- down, Don't bother with this one.","I found this book totally confusing. I kept reading on, waiting for the good parts that never came. The whole section in Italy was hard to follow. I can see why Jodie Foster would want no part of this. The ending made no sense at all. It has none of the suspense the first book had. I just thought this book was horrible. I was mad I wasted my time reading it."
1,WHAT WAS HARRIS THINKING?,"After reading Silence Of The Lambs, I bought this book. I read, didn't understanding one word of it. Than, I got ""curious"". I turned to the back of the book and read the final chapter. Than I thought: What the hell is this? I immediatley stopped reading the book. Those of u who enjoyed Red Dragon and Silence are in for a very dissappointing novel. I won't mention the ending to those of u who are willing to read the book and get VERY dissappointed. This book is nothing but a big piece of trash."
3,"UNLIKELY PLOT, WITH DISAPPOINTING INCONSISTENCIES, BAD END","TO SAY THIS EAGERLY AWAITED SEQUEL IS DISAPPOINTING IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. I FOUND NUMEROUS INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE PLOT (E.G. DATES, SIMULTANEOUS CURRENT EVENTS, LEVEL OF TRAINING FOR STARLING, ETC.) WHICH MADE THE BOOK APPEAR SLOPPY. EVEN MORE OF A PROBLEM IS THE COMPLETELY UNCONVINCING CHANGE IN THE CHARACTERS' PERSONALITIES TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE HARDLY RECOGNIZABLE, E.G. STARLING, HANNIBAL, BARNEY. THE LONG DESCRIPTIONS OF FLORENCE ARE PEDANTIC AND BORING. THE ENDING IS SIMPLY RIDICULOUS; IT'S A CHEAP SHORT CUT."
5,A Great Book,"This book started out great and held its momentum all the way through. I thought the Florence scene that everyone seems to detest was, actually, quite good. I liked seeing how someone tried and failed to catch Lecter. It made you appreciate the previous two books more. As for the ending, I took it as a denounment to the entire Lecter trilogy. If it was ment to be that, Harris did an extraordinary job."
4,A well written yarn with an outstanding ending!,"While I may not have enjoyed Hannibal as much as I have enjoyed other Harris novels, I found it to be an entertaining tale that was very well written. Unlike other amateur reviewers here at Amazon, I found the ending incredibly fresh and unpredictable. I applaud Harris' efforts for a surprise ending I never saw coming."
2,The ending was terrible.,"I enjoyed the book for the first 400 pages or so. Once the ending started, it got very strange and disappointing. It just didn't work or mesh with the rest of the book. I couldn't buy it at all. Although, in hind-sight, the book is pretty absurd in a lot of points."
1,ending on a bad note,"I have read Harris's RD and SOTL. I expected a good solid story. While Mason is something of a chilling character, and the story is somewhat interesting with the detour to Italy, it collapses from a poor, extremely muddled ending.First and foremost, it simply does not follow from what we know about the characters. Obsessive people do not change so easily, and the cheap psychology in the novel hardly justifies the character change at the end. The ending is not bad because it doesn't end ""happily"" or with clearcut morals, but because it simply does not follow from what we know.We learn reasons for some characters' horrific behaviors. But when one takes on similar behaviors for no compelling reason, we have writing that smacks of rush and cheap shock value.Somewhat contradictory to the above criticism, new characters are introduced, with their future easily and correctly guessed, much as we know the fate of a red shirt landing party member on Star Trek. :)"
2,Major disappointment,I am glad I did not buy the book. I so looked forward to reading this book since I had read Harris' other novels and loved the movie. What a disappointment! I wish Mr. Harris spent more time on the psychological background of Hannibal and less time in describing Florence. I was rather surprised that I found Hannibal to be a sympathetic character and was rooting for him (no pun intended) in the end. Clarice was not the Clarice I remembered. I doubt the real Clarice would do what she did in the end. I did not mind the gruesomeness at all since it was to be expected.
2,less than inspiring,The principal attraction of Lambs was the contrast between the thrill of relevation and the threat of violence. I kept reading in hope to discover the underlying tension from this dichtomy but alas there was no real relevation and only violence itself not the threat of it which is by far more interesting. A disppointment.
2,Terrible Ending,"I can not recommend this book. Without being too specific and so as not to ruin the book for anyone who didn't read the book but intends to, I'll just say the ending made no sense to me. When you develop a character to have a sense of him/her self and then just go 180 degrees with them. That is not a surprise ending. It is an absurd and an impossible ending."
2,4/5ths of a good book,"Well, You have got to be kidding regarding the ending of this book. Just terrible and not believeable at all. I will bet that when this book is turned into a movie the ending will be completely different. Did Harris just run out of steam?"
2,Hannibal is in EXTRA RARE form in this novel.,"Tom Harris is inspired as the plot creator for Hannibal Lechter's latest adventures. However, the author lacks any writing skills and the publisher allowed this sophmoric piece of writing to be unleashed on the unsuspecting public. The writing was not horrific enough to detract from the beauty of the plot development and Hannibal is painted in a new light. Although it is definite worth reading, but it will never be studied as a literary masterpiece; just as another sequel done badly. This is one of those cases where we HOPE the movie exceeds the book. Strong cast, good director, and a miraculous screenwriter could have Hannibal attending the Oscars again."
2,"Good story, terrible writer","The story moved along apace. However, Harris is in dire need of an editor. I have two suggestions: Strunk & White and a damn MAP! Obviously Mr. Harris knows nothing about the Washington DC metropolitan area. And his pathetic attempts to be ""avant garde"" in his writing style (the distracting mix of present and past tense) are laughable. Bottom line: this story would have been spectacular at the keyboard of a true master. Lecter would disapprove of Harris."
1,UGH!,How unbelievable - I was so excited to read this book and whata let down. The story was just plain gross and the ending was soincredibly unreal. I'll just continue to re-read Red Dragon!
1,BORING,"I thought to myself when I first saw the book on the shelf finally a sequel to Silence of the Lambs. I went to the library to put it on hold and was the 75th person waiting for the book. When I did get I only had it for two weeks, well it was two weeks too long. I found it boring from the beginning, middle and to the end. Though I must admit I skipped through most of the book hoping to find it more thrilling and keep on the edge of my seat, but alas. It was like Hannibal never came into the picture until the end. Mason Verger was a pain, Krendell was a nothing and what of Starling, well just that what. She was more interesting in Silence of the Lamb. I'm glad I didn't buy this book. Thomas Harris I enjoyed your first two books, The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, what a disappoint about the third. Can't wait for the movie, hope it will be better."
2,hated the ending,"I enjoyed the book, until the ending. So unbelieveable and out of Starling's character! Hated it! Really, I regret buying this book. Yuck."
4,"If you liked S.O.the L., you're gonna LOVE this book.","In Silence of the Lambs,Harris' presentation of the main characters was only the tip of the iceberg. Hannibal develops the title character and that of Clarice Starling beyond my greatest hopes and we are left with the question...who are the bad guys and who are the good? The richness of detail is wonderful. I was totally engrossed until the end."
3,very readable but a disappointing ending,"Like most of the folks who've added their thoughts here i read and loved Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs... This book although very readable and enjoyable fails to resolve itself in a realistic manner. The last chapter reminded me of one of the later Vampire books by Anne Rice. Cute and Glossy. What made the other two novels so great was that they had their feet firmly on the ground. Here, things just got silly."
3,WAIT FOR THE MOVIE...,"First off, I did enjoy it, and hardly put it down. However, while reading HANNIBAL, I couldn't help but think that the movie version of this will no doubt be much more powerful and frightening. It was all build-up but no tension, and the action sequences are really brief. Plus, Harris' tone is just a little too stilted this time around as well...he's mimicking some baroque literary style instead of just getting on with it. The book seemed almost like the novelization of the film, rather than the other way around. Harris almost seems to be describing the stage directions and editing rather than telling the story. However, a good screenwriter, director and cast should be able to turn this into a strong sequel to the film version of ""Silence"" without letting the words get in the way...and I'd wager you'll enjoy the movie much more if you don't read the book first."
3,Thought it was great until...,"I have to say that I was one of those people who eagerly awaited this book. I read nonstop, day & night for 2 days straight and couldn't believe what I was reading. A wonderful book, until about the last 30-40 pages. The ending managed to ruin the entire thing for me. Harris could've done better!"
1,Boring,"If all-wise, all-powerful heroes are the dullest characters in fiction all-wise, all-powerful villains run them a close second. The parts of this book that follow Clarice Starling are interesting enough, but the parts that concentrate on Hannibal Lecter soon had me skimming forward. As a mysterious character casting a shadow of evil in The Silence of the Lambs Hannibal Lecter was quite effective, but the more he moves into the foreground in Hannibal the more two-dimensional he seems. The torture scenes were particularly unsatisfactory, as the author seemed unable to capture the horror of his previous books and ended up substituting grossness instead. This book is another good reason to own a library card."
3,Kind of liked it ...,"I love Clarice. And I love Hannibal. But I didn't want them to fall in love with one another. The idea I've always had of Clarice is that she is a strong woman - surely getting screwed by the FBI and coming face-to-face with man-eating pigs would not lead her to eloping with a cannibal?! The book was enjoyable for shock-value; I did like the many Harris witticisms; and I found the references to King Henry VIII, Dante, Judas Iscariot etc interesting. It's the kind of book that knocks your socks off at the time, but is ultimately forgettable - much like the sequels to Interview with a Vampire."
2,what in the world happened to the characters?,"After reading the Red Dragon and The silence of the Lambs, I was really looking forword to this book. Like so many of the fans, I rushed out and purchased the novel on the first day it arrived in local bookstores. And than I got home and read it... What can I say... None of the characters seemed like they were from TSOTL. Hannibal was a dark and mysterious person in the other two novels. Here he is focused on too much and all of the darkness is reduced to a some what annoying character. Starling, Crawford, and Mapp are basicly just there in my opinion. i felt that Harris' needed to expand on their characters in order for readers to care for them. Overall, the plot was not too bad, but when the reader does not care for the character, it is hard for a story to work. Also, I found the ending of the novel to be very, well just bad."
2,Disappointing Development of SOTL Characters,"I admit that I sat glued reading Hannibal hoping that Harris's treatment of the characters would revert back to what they were in SOTL. Sadly Harris failed in Hannibal what he accomplished in Red Dragon & SOTL. The 3diminsional characters fleshed out in SOTL become 2 diminsional in Hannibal. Both Hannibal and Clarice deserved better character development that they got here. The ""humanizing"" of Hannibal and the ""dehumanizing"" of Starling was incredibly disappointing. The Starling character deserved so much better than what was afforded her, especially at the end. Granted a further sequel is now possible...but I have to admit...I certainly won't look forward to it as much as I looked forward to this sequel. What a pity!"
1,Don't finish this book,"My advice to anyone reading this book is to stop on page 463 and make up your own ending. It could not possibly be worse than the crappy one in the book.The rest of the book was ok, but I grew a little tired of Harris constantly using confusing metaphors over and over. Words that you have never seen together before, but he puts them together 30 times in 100 pages. Because they sound so ""off"" you notice when he keeps repeating them. Buy a thesaurus for crying out loud!"
2,Very disappointing,"Red Dragon- excellent, SOTL - brilliant, Hannibal - waste of paper What a disappointment. The psychological picture of Lector built up in the previous books has been ruined by this sequel. If I didn't know better I'd say it was written by someone else. It started promisingly but just deteriorated into an extremely unlikely, dissatisfying conclusion."
4,Not what you expect but should it be?,"I'm surprised by most of the reviews. If Harris wrote books that were what everyone expected, why would we bother? I enjoyed finding out why Hannibal is the way he is, since you sort of like him it's nice to know he did have motivation.I admit the ending was a big surprise, but isn't that what we like in a good book? I can't see it being a movie and I don't know if there will be anohter Hannibal book but I did really enjoy this one and I did have to reread the ending.I loved the detail and historical allusions. If you want a straight pulp shocker read someone else. This was evidently the book he wanted to write, Hollywood or no and I did really enjoy reading it even if it was not at all what I expected and maybe because of that."
1,Silence of the Hams,"First things first, Red Dragon ans Silence of the Lambs are classic books that gave great insight to the psychology of profiling serial killers and of serial killers themselves. And they were good thrillers to boot. However, this book is unbelievably bad. I wish I could have gave it a negative star review. Everything is wrong with this book. Jonathan Demme was being polite when he bowed out of making a film out of this mess by saying , 'it's too violent"" . The whole premise of the book is ludicrous and the ending is even worse. It wouldn't shock me to find out that this book was ghost written by the same person who ghost writes those V.C. Andrews books. Turst me, save your money or give it to charity. If you don't believe me, check this book out at the library. You'll thank me and yourself......."
1,A tragic waste of paper and ink,"Okay, okay, I think I know what happened: Hannibal Lecter rose up through the pages, roasted Mr. Harris over a spit, and enjoyed him with poached asparagus and a nice Chardonnay. Then the good doctor finished the book himself. (Did he begin his meal with the editor as an appetizer?)Why is it that we can all agree about Red Dragon and Silence being so superb, but the 5-star folks rise up with righteous indignation when we 1-star folks call this silliness what it is? Mr. Harris clearly just wanted to get this thing done, at all costs. I feel like I've been mugged. I'm donating my copy, anonymously, to the local library. I don't want anyone to know I actually bought this thing.*Note to the nice Amazon people: Why can't we have the option of giving NO stars? This book didn't deserve any."
1,This book doesn't even deserve commentary it's so bad.,"No, it's not too dark or too over the top. It's just plain badly written. Did the publisher read this book? If you purchase Hannibal you'll feel cheated. What in the world was Steven King thinking?."
2,DON'T WASTE TIME OR MONEY!!,"When I heard that'Hannibal' was out at my local bookstore, I jumped in the car and bought it. What a great, great disappointment. Bottom line - the ending was completely out of character for both Clarice and Hannibal. After 10 years, you'd think Mr. Harris could come up with a better ending. The characters were reduced to rubble. Better than Hannibal's background etc. should have remained a mystery!"
4,"Thank you Mr. Harris, Thank you Hannibal.","I read your long awaited sequel with regret from the very first page. Regret because I knew I would have only a few hours to be with Hannibal's character.In reading I seek not perfection, but the ability to walk away with more than I had before I started. You have never disappointed me Mr. Harris. Hannibal certainly has never disappointed me. I experienced many moments of joy and emotional upheaval while reading your latest book. Hannibal again reminded me of how very much I have yet to learn and experience on a variety of subjects. You and Hannibal both educate and provoke. What more can one expect from a book.Thank you again."
5,Has educational value,"Harris does great research before facing a blank monitor and keyboard. Ian Fleming of 007 fame also included much bon vivant research and shared it with the reader. Harris tops this with the ever refreshing eclecticism of Dr. Lecter. The plot is as fast moving as Fleming's adventures, but Harris' writing skills reflect those of Thomas Wolfe, i.e. great turn of phases, subtle humor and awesome descriptive ability. In addition, his character creations are identifiable and one can really get to hate/love the identities. One lament: why can't video/movie industry mirror a fraction of Harris' scripting....I actually walked out of the new ""Star Wars"" due to terminal boredom with the script. If it takes Harris 12 years for another book, I don't mind waiting for the quality he offers."
3,this book rides in the middle,"i'm torn about this book. it's definitely a fun read; however, that's all it is. much like Harris's other books, HANNIBAL maintains massive elements of suspense and highly psychotic violence. and when you add an eloquent delivery to this equation, HANNIBAL becomes a number you immerse yourself in. but this book, is by no means, Harris's finest work. HANNIBAL is inferior to RED DRAGON and, especially, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. the sad fact is this: it's too hard to say if this book is really good or bad . . . it's basically a judgement call. and a judgement call always must be made from the middle of the road."
1,"Starlings and Lecter, we hardly knew ye!","Apparently Mr. Harris needs to reread the first two brilliant installments of his trilogy. Hannibal takes two characters previously well developed and morphs them into entirely different beings. Clarice straying from her firm belief in law and order, regardless of the political climate of the FBI? Dr.Lecter delving in the psychobabble he so detested in the prequels and showing a human compassionate side? I think not! I finished the book this morning and immediately began calling all those I knew to be fans of the trilogy to warn them to save their money on this terribly disappointing ""sequel""."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!! WAS NOT WORTH THE WAIT!,I like all Harris fans could not wait for this book. I never could have imagined it like this. I am lost for words to express my feelings at how bad this was.
2,An obvious movie bid,"I was quite disappointed in the book. Like everyone else, I waited for years to read the sequel that was so obviously coming. Now that I've read it, I feel somewhat cheated. I found myself being somewhat understanding of Hannibal's nastiness... instead of being in awe of a mysterious force of nature."
4,Worthy Sequel,Very different from silence of the lambs and red dragon. Really a pschological study of Clarice and Lector. Gripping.
2,The worst let-down in literary history.,"I wouldn't be so angry if the book had been awful from the start. But it's not. It's wonderful--full of wit and intrigue and the wonderful prose that Harris is capable of.But in the last few chapters, he goes so terribly wrong that it just makes you want to cry. Lecter and Starling go so far out of character as to make you wonder what Harris was thinking. Did he deliberately want to disappoint and anger his fans? He certainly did a good job with this one. After waiting so long for this book to appear, and after enjoying most of it thoroughly, I can only say that the last few chapters of this book are the worst betrayal of character and reader that I have ever come across.Shame on you, Mr. Harris. I want my money back."
1,"1/3 good, 1/3 so so & 1/3 awful","Perhaps this book suffered from the expectations of this reader; another problem may have been that I read the reviews prior to reading the book. All that aside I can only state that this book was a disappointment. Mr. Harris started off well, and the plot moved rapidly for the first third of the book, after that it detiorated rapidly, culminating in the finale, the inane ending. Awful! Even with a substantial discount this book is not worth buying."
1,This book was a major disappointment.,"The only thing good about this book, is the money it will make Harris. He didn't stay true to the characters and the ending makes John Grishams endings appear as literary mastery. Pick up a copy of Terry Kays THE KIDNAPPING OF AARON GREENE. An author you never disappoints."
2,Disappointing,"Disappointing. I recently read the book ""Red Dragon"". I found that to be a great page turner. So, What about Hanibal? Starts off great! Had me hooked from the first chapter, only to be let down with the remainder of the book. What was meant to be a shock for the readers turned out to be uncharacteristic of Harris and unimaginative. It seems as if the Lecter/Starling Saga ends with little creativity and a lot of screenplay."
2,What was Harris thinking?,"I waited to read reviews of this book until after I had read it myself, and I was glad that I wasn't the only one who was terribly disappointed. I was first introduced to Dr. Lechter in ""Red Dragon"", and got to know him better in ""Silence of the Lambs"", but the Dr. Lechter in this book is not the same character. None of ""Hannibal's"" characters is well defined and mental imagery is fuzzy at best. I kept trudging through page after page of mundane text, anxiously awaiting another Thomas Harris climactic ending, only to close the book angily, and wonder ""How could he do this to his readers?"" My advice to potential readers is to just ask someone who had read the book about the ending. Once you learn what happens, you'll be glad you didn't waste your time or money."
3,Very Bizzare and Surreal,"I read the reviews before I read the book, so my expectations were low. I thought it moved along pretty well. Mason was a bit ""007 Bad Guy"" dramatic with his elaborate revenge plot. I did want another hunt-for-Hannibal story, but Harris already did that twice before. I think the book has much more depth and lesson-to-be-learned imagery. I don't think the point or the ending were meant to be taken at face value. I'm not too worried, though. Harris could write another one. I can't see how De Laurentis is going to make a movie out of it. He would have to redo the ending to make it Hollywood friendly. Mr. Harris...good book and I'll continue to look at the deeper meaning I think you intended the readers to find."
3,Pretty good until the preposterous ending....,"I read ""Red Dragon"" (5 stars) for the first time and re-read ""Lambs"" (5 stars) in anticipation of reading ""Hannibal."" I really ""devoured"" this story until the silly ending. I enjoyed Dr. Lecter much more when he was ""out there somewhere."" An opera with Clarise? Come on, Mr. Harris. I look forward to the movie, but only if you change the ending before you waste acting talent on what could be in the league of the first two books. Keep it scary, not silly."
3,The ending was disappointing.,"I could not wait to receive my copy of ""Hannibal"". However, I expected much more of the the author, Thomas Harris, in describing Dr. Lector. I was very disappointed to see how Claice fell so short on her character and could not believe that she would fall under the 'control' of Dr. Lector. As for Mason Verger, his death was not as I expected and once again I felt cheated out of a meeting between the him and Hannibal. The ending could have been one of excitement and hair-raising, however, it let me down. Maybe Mr. Harris will write another sequel to ""Hannibal"", one with a more believable ending and one that will leave you wanting more. I enjoyed reading this book; however, when the ending came, it was a different story. Mr. Harris, please try again."
5,And the sequel is...,"Gotta take your skull off to Thomas Harris. Rather than play to the Lecter circut, he fashioned a truly creative work with characters already created. He unbalances and challenges readers to confront unsavory and shocking things, by shifting tenses and loyalties.I wholeheartedly recommend this book, though I feel a little gun-shy posting that I have a whole heart...someone out there might be hungry.And didn't the narrator say there were TWO surviving victims of the good doctor..."
3,Enjoy your Chianti before you read this book.,"Hopefully you are not reading this review to find out what happens but rather to decide if you want to buy this book. Now that it is in paperback buy it. It is graphic. Hannibal is one sick puppy. The ending is a cop out but read it to judge for yourself. Mr. Harris is a terrific writer. He is extremely graphic. If you get woozy watching those surgery and paramedic shows on tv, do not read this. If you appreciate good writing, evil, psychology and suspense, you will enjoy and appreciate this book. A great summer read (during the day, not the night)!"
1,Thomas Harris? Are you in love with Clarice?,"Or are you in love period? I find no other reason that you'd take this twist unless you were somehow engaged in sublimation. I found nothing implausible in the affection Clarice and Lecter shared, but was shocked that this is where Harris would take the characters. I have read the forward to the re-relased ""Red Dragon"" where Harris denies responsibility for character development. Stop hiding, Tommy. Lecter got the girl, did you?"
2,What a disappointment!,"Being a huge fan of his earlier work, ""Silence of the Lambs"", I was anxiously awaiting the release of ""Hannibal"". What a disappointment! 400 pages of build up for one creepy scene and a COMPLETELY unbelievable ending. I still don't understand why Harris thought we would accept his ending as plausible. With all the creative outcomes he could have penned, this ending leaves me feeling totally betrayed."
2,Dissapointed,"I am a huge fan of Silence of the Lambs and fell in love with the book. However, I was very let down when I began Hannibal. All of the mystery and detail that made Silence of the Lambs what it is was completely abandoned when writing Hannibal. The only shock factor that this book contains is the goriness which does, I have to say, make Silence of the Lambs look like Dr. Seuss. The book was intersting and if you loved Silence of the Lambs it is a must read. However, don't set your standards too high when reading this book if you plan on enjoying it."
5,POSTMODERN GOTHIC with MILTONIAN OVERTONES,"Author Harris out Rice's Rice in this preposterous yet irresistible sequel to the book-turned-movie that made fava beans a household name worldwide. Sacrificed by her colleagues to the political ambitions of an FBI ""boys club"" elite, Starling's eventual embrace of Lecter the fallen angel seems not only plausible, but inevitable. A darkly sensuous romance in the best tradition of Hawthorne and Melville guaranteed to leave many enthralled and others disgruntled."
1,A perfect example of an author attempting to outdo himself.,"Thomas Harris has saved his time-consuming research and imagination for his worst performance to date. In order to follow up his best work in ""Silence..."" he needed to shock us, to surprise us. He failed. ""Hannibal"" is a perfect example of an author attempting to outdo himself. As sequels often go, this one belongs in your trash."
2,"It was OK, until the end. Then it turned awful!","The story was entertaining at first, not great, but just bad enough to still be entertaining. There were a few slow parts, but there were also some really good parts. Learning about Hannibal as a boy was interesting, he started to became a much more sympathetic charachter rather than the serial killer. My major gripe was with the last 100 pages. After the climax of the book, you have the biggest let down. I don't think that the ending really involved the same people that the book started off with. I think Starling must have an evil twin that replaced her in the very end, because what happened was totally out of character for her. Maybe she was bonked on the head and didn't remember anything about herself..."
1,Worst book I have ever read.,"This book is not merely a bad book, this book is so bad that it left me angry and wanting my money back. I could almost accept a book that had a disjointed narrative that spends too much time with weird uninteresting characters, a villain that is more disgusting than disturbing, and a silly side trip to Italy which feels like it was thrown into the book to so the author could write off a trip to Italy as a business expense. Those things I could accept. But an utterly illogical ending that betrays everything the Silence of the Lambs was about -- this I can not accept. This book is puke."
2,Expected more however did not impress much !,"As said expected more in-depth and more exciting, however it is the same thing as the past ( well what do you expect it is a sequel ) but hello ! the reader is more anxious. Till half way down the road the reader is still guessing and gives the impression as the Lecter guy never appears and just keeps on describing Clarice and her life history, and also praises Dr. Lecter as if he is Godfather or what. It is surely made good for a commercial success for the hollywood thing but as far as the book is concerned it is okay, written with the perspective of making a movie ( probably )."
1,Disappointing,What a disappointment....after reading The Silence of The Lambs I expected so much more. Hannibal hardly held my interest for longer than 30 minutes at a time. Where is the mystery? These two characters came together so wonderfully in SILENCE and created such an intriguing relationship. One could have only anticipated the same for the sequel.
1,very disappointing,I started reading Harris' books over the summer. It took me 3 months to finish this one. Talk about a boring read! The ending was horrible! What did he do- get bored with writing and decided to come up with a quick fix to end it?
1,Thomas Harris does not deserve your financial support,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. When I finished, I said to my husband, ""That's what happens when you write for money."" I enjoyed Harris' previous novels, and even considered them well-written. This novel is not well-written, lacks character continuity, and was very much a waste of my time. I do not believe you should encourage this author to write more material, and I believe this will make one quite awful movie. You have been warned."
4,It was a very tasty experience.,"This sequel had everything a Thomas Harris reader would want. I was impressed by the depth which Harris expressed Hannibal. I couldn't believe the way the book ended. I had to reread it again. Although I really enjoyed it, I can't see it ending the same way when Hollywood makes the movie. It is worth reading for yourself."
1,really disappointing,"I'm glad I didn't buy this book, but got it from the library. If I had bought it I would have felt like I wasted a lot of money. I thought the book was okay until the ending. But the ending isn't what you would expect and really made the book a waste of time."
4,It met all my expectations,"In the years since I have read Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon I have hoped that Harris would deliver a sequel (or call it what you will) in which we find out everything we want to know about Hannibal Lecter.. what makes him tick? Why does he do what he does, what will become of his relationship with Clarice? I am deeply satisfied with the conclusion of this book, which I found to be thought-provoking and will probably continue to be, for me, long after Hollywood turns it into a catch-the-bad-guy thriller.My only complaint with Hannibal lies in Harris's inconsistent switching from past to present tense, and back again. Also, while it is plainly evident that Harris has done his research, I find the extent of detail provided to be at times unwarranted and discursive."
2,"A highly implausible, disappointing ending","Clarice Starling (aka Jodie Foster) wouldn't do it! I liked the book and feverishly ""ate"" through it, but I was extremely disappointed with the ending. I believe it is better written than the first, but that Mr. Harris was at a loss as to how to finish it, and it shows. The Silence of the Lambs was frightening, Red Dragon was absolutely terrifying, Hannibal was not. It turned into a silly, unbelievable ""love"" story that is more sickening than the gruelish crimes committed in the novel."
2,Little suspense - deeply disappointing conclusion.,"None of the deaths in this book come as a surprise - bad guys lose, good guys more or less win - thought the method of the killings shows a lot of thought and imagination.Even the end, which is unsatisfying and unbelieveable, was not a surprise - I began to dread it half-way through - it seemed the only way out for Starling and Hannibal. But it doesn't wash, and certainly doesn't satsify. When we read a book, we are looking for entertainment but also for something related to our lives and our world, however remotely, and Hannibal's conclusion is from some dimension so amoral that it fails to connect in any way."
1,No. 3 on my list of all-time worst books I've read,"It's not No. 1 on my all-time worst book list because I have read Anne Rivers Siddons' ""Peachtree Road"" and Alexadra Ripley's ""Scarlet"". I was extremely disappointed in this ""Silence of the Lambs"" sequel. The author has turned the fabulous Clarice Starling into a buffoon, and it goes downhill from there."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,Several subplots blur the true story of Hannibals continous run from the FBI and his interest in Clarice Starling. The ending did not seem to leave much room for another Hannibal novel.
2,typical sequel,"I couldn't wait to dive into this book- the first ""fun"" novel I've read in a while. I had no fun reading it- the change in location after a decent start was disappointing (thought it had one or two good moments, and transitioned back well enough,if predictably) but the story line as it included Clarice was lame, and depicted her as a very one-dimensional character. I found Hannibal's background interesting,and I would have prefered to know a lot more about him. He doesn't have to do anything to be interesting, he just is. This book is not."
1,This is his worst book to date!,My all time favorite movie is Silence of the Lambs. Just recently I finished reading the Red Dragon his first book that introduces Dr. Lecter and the book was really good. However after buying this book I was really disappionted! I found the book to be really boring.. It had too many chapters on Italy that was really hard to follow unless you speak the language or have been there. I didn't like the fact that Clarice was hardly in the book and when she was it was a joke.(no wonder Jodie Foster doesn't want to do this movie). I'm sorry Thomas Harris but I don't reccomend this book for anyone.
4,Hilarious!,"I don't know if Thomas Harris was aiming for the funnybone or not when he wrote Hannibal but he had me rolling on the floor! It's refreshing to read an author who doesn't take himself or his characters too seriously. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter has become such a part of our culture (is there anyone who doesn't recognize the name?) what else could Harris do with him but take him over the top? Hannibal's ""dinner party"" scene near the end is a perfect example -- could any serious-minded author have written that? Whether you were a fan of Silence of the Lambs or not you must read Hannibal if only to find out why Jodi Foster refused to play the part of Clarice in the upcoming movie (I don't think you'll blame her!). If nothing else, you'll get a good laugh."
1,Mr. Harris Should Be Ashamed of Himself,"This is not a sequel to ""Silence,"" it is a crude joke. He's taken Starling and regressed her instead of building on her character. She speaks in Catskill twang through most of the book. Lecter is now one of these bad guys who only kills really bad people, or people trying to steal his wallet. Or people trying to catch him. Whatever happened to devouring census takers? He's not truly bad, now, in fact, the reader gets a cuddly personal history of Lecter which explains why he became so bad, darnit! It wasn't his fault! Some bad guys did bad things, and made Lecter bad! Mommy! I'm bad now! A misfire on every conceivable level, staring with the first chapter. So disappointing...so sad. Lecter is almost superhuman, does this guy work out or what? The ending will leave your mouth agape. Agape at the horror of what Harris could have been possibly thinking when he scribbled this missive on paper. Abominable"
2,Was this a satire?,"This book was so implausible it wasn't even witty. Auto-cannibalism, man-eating pigs...and the ""Nazis ate my sister"" bit just wasn't enough to turn Hannibal into a romantic hero. And that ending! Did Starling sustain massive head trauma at some point? I did not find it believable that Clarice, our scion of law and order, would ever run away with a mass murderer. But God forbid that a strong woman not be knocked down into her place. Still, couldn't Harris have contented himself with trivializing her character by refering to her looks every time she was mentioned? This book left me with the feeling that Tom Harris toyed with his readers as skillfully as Lecter ever did."
4,Good but not great,"The Red Dragon surpasses Hannibal in every way possible. However I do not wish detract from Hannibal, I dont think Harris could ever out do The Red Dragon. Many times I wish an author would stop after one great book. However, Harris makes me reconsider this theory as Hannibal is a very well written work. Not quite as great as Red Dragon but it is worth a read. Just dont read it by yourself."
2,Mason fed the dogs his face; I want to feed them this book,"After steamrolling through this book as soon as I got it in the mail, all I can say is ""Why?"" Thomas Harris crafted some truly awesome novels in Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs. He's very cinematic in his writing...but now he's just got the meat cleaver out. Yecch. Unfortunately, the USA Toady review sounds like this, although I will say that their review was all political correctness and nonsense. Get off the soapbox - just review the book."
3,VROOM VROOM... sputter,"The first 2/3rds of 'Hannibal' are a fine show of what Harris does best. Crackling set pieces and a superb chronicle of law enforcement's people and mechanisms. Harris is also cunningly adept at evoking events and places with seemingly effortless sensory details. An utter page-turner, 'Hannibal' kept me riveted for 300 pages. Then the shift turned more to Harris' new villian, and I found myself less and less able to suspend disbelief. The ending, while amazing and provocative, is pure fantasy. The previous entries in the Lechter trilogy stuck to my ribs by being both beautifully shocking and utterly believable. Sharing the same universe, 'Hannibal' eventually falls short on both counts."
2,More is less.,"Worth a read for fans of the previous installments, but not nearly up to par. Most notable failure is lack of suspense. The plot lumbers along, through a forest of typically well observed details which can't hold interest because they're unnecessary to guess where things are headed. As for Dr. Lecter: fleshed out, he becomes more a stock super-villain, less a myth-like nightmare figure. Finally, the book is simply too thick for a relatively thin story. Mr. Harris could've used an editor on this one."
4,A worthy follow-up to Silence of the Lambs,"Remember when you saw 'Silence of the Lambs' and saw Hannibal Lecter for the first time as Starling came to his dungeon cell?? That look that Lecter had in his eyes? If you can't remember, then I envy you as it was all I thought about as I read - no, devoured - this chapter in the saga of one of literature's most fascinating characters. Lecter is a masterful creation and this book truly grabs you by the throat and won't let you go. I didn't mind the gruesome parts that the media is making so much of. Both of Harris' previous tales that included Lecter were equally disturbing in their realistic depictions of modern evil. You won't regret this one!"
5,"Marvelous, multi-layered, read til you drop novel!","It would seem, from reading the reviews below, you either love this novel or hate it. Happily, I felt my money was well spent, as I loved it. The plot was dense and many-layered, adding a depth and breadth to the characters of Lecter and Starling that was only touched upon in the earlier novels. The ending was indeed a surprise, but once considered, fits in well with the series. I loved it, gross details and all. More Harris, more!"
4,Wonderfully gross,I read the reviews on this site but bought the book anyway. I am glad I did. The visual images painted by Mr. Harris are wonderfully gross. I was curious about the ending after so much uproar. The ending is fine and made you go hmmmmmmm.
1,What an utter disappointment,"For years, I've walked into bookstores inquiring anyone that would listen to me as to what Thomas Harris was doing. I was hoping, praying that he was doing something along the lines of Red Dragon or Silence of the Lambs. Unfortunately, with this book, it appears as though that wasn't even close to the case.While the Red Dragon had characters and images that I'll never forget, this book is UTTERLY FORGETTABLE! All these years of waiting and we get this?!This book reminds me of how long we all waited for Boston's third album only to be disappointed and wish they had never released it, but instead had simply retired on top. Sadly, I feel the same about this book and Mr. Harris."
3,"Interesting, but also curiously flat in too many places","While I enjoyed spending time with Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starling again, and actually felt the ending was a logical conclusion to the relationship Harris first begun in Silence of the Lambs, I was also unmoved by elements of the story , particularly the graphic scenes of violence which too often bordered on caricature. I also felt that Harris' writing style in this book created a voyeuristic sense in the reader (at least this reader) which further distanced me from the text. His humanization of Hannibal Lector was necessary given the ending, but did in the end detract from the essential mystery of the man that I found so compelling in his previous works. I will be interested in seeing how this translates to the screen, and whether Hollywood (and the audience) will let stay the final denouement of Clarice and Hannibal."
4,"Great story, but I wasn't crazy about the performance.","This is a great story. Harris is one of those guys who would rather write an interesting and compelling story than pander to the screenwriters who will inevitably butcher his work. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was that I wasn't crazy about the reader (unabridged audio version). He did a great voice for Hannibal Lector, but his stuffy, fake-sounding British accent did nothing for Starling's voice or anyone else's. Overall he was good, but not great."
1,This book is horrible,This book is a horrible book. It did not live up to expectations considering how good silence of the lambs was. If you have not read this book and you enjoyed silence of the lambs then I suggest you pass on this book.
3,I enjoyed the book..hated the ending,"I thoroughly enjoyed RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. I read Hannibal with equally high hopes. I did not hate the book. However, the ending was disturbingly horrid. ***SPOILER*** Clarice would never in a million years run off with Dr. Lector. EVER. It was completely out of character. It's like saying Hugh Hefner decided to become homosexual."
1,You've got to be kidding me,"I waded through the revenge plot and was left with a handful of air at the end. What a jaw-droppingly bad ending. Mr. Harris, what were you thinking?"
1,Unbelievably awful!!,"As someone who *loved* Harris's books ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" almost to the point of obsession, I cannot believe that the same person who created such complex, fascinating books as those two wrote the distasteful mess that is ""Hannibal"". Boo!!! Hiss!!! I felt almost as if I was reading a sequel by a different author who never had understood the characters or the appeal of the books in the first place (a la the bogus ""Gone With the Wind"" sequel...)To my mind, it was not the gross-out factor that made the first two books great, but the fabulous psychological interplay between the bright, honorable (and properly nervous) FBI agents and the brilliant psychopath anti-hero. Hannibal Lecter as a misunderstood hero with a back-story just did not work for me.Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! to the ending!!! My copy of this book ended up in the *garbage*. A *dismal* finale (at least I *hope* it is the finale!) to an otherwise brilliant series of books!"
3,Hannibal The Scamible,"I feel completely rip offed. This book was good through out the first half of the book. It was going in the right direction or so it seemed. but from the second half it just got to the point where you wanted the book to end. But then to add to my dismay, when the book did end, it ended up horrible. It was pointless to write a book like this and end it the way that Thomas Harris did. It looked as though this book had been rushed. If I could return it and get my money back, I would."
2,It all just fizzled...,"Harris' writing style and imagery started out the novel with great potential. To my surprise the book was not filled with blood, mutilation and murder. The voilence lay more within the minds of Mason Verger and, of course, Dr. Lecter. I couldn't put the book down and found myself driven to read on not by the writing but by a morbid curiosity as to the ending. I found the novel's plot to build for a while, plateau and then fizzle into nothing. The only thing good about the ending is that is is completely unexpected... but that really is the ONLY good thing about it. I found the ending to be disappointing, confusing, unexplainable, and almost completely untied to the rest of the book. After following Lecter, Verger and Starling for almost 400 pages, I found the ending not worth the time."
2,What a Disappointment!,"I have been eagerly awaiting the 'Hannibal' book and boy, was I disappointed! It is not the face paced novel like, 'Red Dragon' and 'Silence of the Lambs'. Instead, Mr Harris gives us a lesson in Italian history and describes with great detail the places that Hannibal has visited. Clarice Starling also is in this novel, having fallen on hard times, her rising star, now fallen. Suspended from the FBI, she is not the first on the scene when we find out who Lecter's identity is. Also, the main villian of this novel is not Lecter, but Mason Verger, a man who is permanently disfigured by Lecter. He now swears revenge on Hannibal, and means to take it by training pigs to eat him from the feet up. The ending of the book is the most unbelievable with Clarice and Hannibal teaming up. I was truly disappointed by the ending. Don't waste your time, re-read 'Lambs' or 'Red Dragon'Thanks for reading!**Pandora"
1,Beyond disappointing,"Why, Thomas Harris, why? Why, after seven years, did you unleash this mess on your waiting fans? I was so happy when I heard that there would be a conituation of The Silence of the Lambs, only to be horribly let down by the results. The ending is ridiculous. It doesn't make sense at all - and comes so quickly after hundreds of pages building ""suspense"" (which never really happens). And do we have to endure so many people mistaking Hannibal Lecter for Satan? We understand that he is a malevolent person, but that doesn't make him the ultimate evil. Spare yourself the money and time - please."
2,Disappointing,It is clear that Thomas Harris had a movie deal. And that he needed a book to fulfill the movie deal. So he slapped this unworthy work together. A very disappointing follow up to Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs.
2,Disappointment,"After eagerly awaiting this sequel to a fabulous book I was incredibly disappointed. The author was not true to his characters. Their behaviour was not remotely believable and after enjoying both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs I was amazed to find this written by the same person. The plots were sloppy, the characters unreal and the pace boring. I would definitely NOT reccommend this book."
4,Well Done!,"Unlike some of the more scathing reviews presented on this page, I was very happy with Hannibal. Its not a book for the weak of stomach, that much is certain!I was not too suprised in the turnaround of Clarice's character, nor with the development of Lecter. I suggest you re-read Silence before tackling this one, and pay attention to what you read: my guess is those most disappointed by it only watched the movie or skimmed through Silence.I have no need to defend this book, I think it is an excellent piece of work. Not often you find characters growing or changing, as they do with Thomas Harris."
3,Should have ended with Chapter 88.,"I felt that the story had a huge set-up that culminated in a fast-paced action-packed conflict, only to wrap-up many of the loose details of the story quickly and dissappointingly from a single, mysterious perspective that differed from the matter-of-fact linear style of the preceding chapters. Overall a good read. I can see Hollywood's upcoming interpretation differing in many ways."
1,Harris has resorted to shocking the reader,"I am not squeamish or prudish, and I loved each of Harris' other books, but at the end of Hannibal, I felt violated. The reader from La Luz, NM was correct when they wrote that the book could have used a better editor and that the characters - especially Clairce - go against type. Clarice never showed any indication that she craved the lush life, yet she ends up falling for Dr. Lecter's bourgeois trappings. What would her Daddy and Mama think? Plus, with Kendler out of the picture, her career could have been salvaged. Speaking of Krendler, I understand that this is a horror novel, but some of the more graphic details were simply unnecessary."
1,I regret wasting my time reading Hannible,The worse book I have ever read. The only reason I continued was that I read a review saying the last 100 pages were gripping. I regret not throwing it in the trash as soon as I realized it was written to be a grade B movie. Thank you Jodie Foster for not going forward with this obnoxious story.
2,"Forced, overly gruesome, disappointing.","I looked forward to Mr. Harris' new book, but was disappointed fairly early on. Did not contain the peculiar ""empathy"" I found in Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon; also seemed to depend too heavily on SOTL for support. In addition, the gruesome details and characters, I feel, overwhelmed the psychological dexterity of his previous novels."
3,"Not bad, but not up to the other books' caliber","Harris might want to consider skipping some of his tonier reference manuals and re-reading his own work. Did anyone notice that a lot of the gore in ""Hannibal"" was recycled from ""Red Dragon?"" And after 11 years, there's really no excuse to make inaccurate reference to ""Silence of the Lambs,"" because Frederica Bimmel was NOT a ""floater,"" as Harris has Starling recall. She was better hidden than Buffalo Bill's other victims, a key plot point and one of the ways she tracks down Jame Gumb. In fact, Bimmel wasn't even the dead girl from the autopsy scene in ""Silence."" That's just sloppy. The travelogue in Florence was tedious at first, but I got into it more as time went on. I don't think we should have revisited every ""Silence"" character, though. I did like the risk he took by explaining Hannibal's past -- it made him a bit less cartoonishly evil. And I did like the ending."
5,I loved it! Even the ending,"These reviews seem to be mostly split between people who liked the book up until the ending and gave it one star, and folks who loved the whole thing and gave it 5. Count me in that category. Sure the book comes to a surprise conclusion but that's the fun of it. I will say that Chapter 100, the ""dinner party,"" was the most amazing eight pages of fiction that I have ever read in my life. I can't get that scene out of my mind!"
1,STUPID!,"Well, my review is in..""Hannibal"" is....* Hilariously implausible * Fatuous...in a disturbing way! * Plotted in suprisingly awkward form! * Ugly...rather than interesting! * A seeming attempt to extend an existing story line ""to the limits."" (It overshoots the mark...wildly...like a drunken barnstormer.) * A BIG disappointment!Horror has never been so...well, just plain sophmorically inane. So much for expectations.Book buyers: save your money; don't encourage this degrading, despressing bilge.Library patrons: don't worry if your name is far down the waiting list. This one will make your sunny day at the beach seem like a year cleaning loos in an insane asylum.Yuk!"
1,What a trite effort to cash in on a master monster!,"After anxiously awaiting the return of Dr. Lecter, I bought ""The Book"", planned out a rainey Sunday and prepared to read. One third into this mess, I thought something was wrong with me that I this book was so bad.....I then realized when it took over two weeks to finish this potpouri of garbage, that it wasn't me. This is such a cheap shot at what was a super series about a well-crafted demon, that it defies description. Most reviewers didn't like the ending, and true, it was terrible. It did, however, match the nonsensical story line. I am so disappointed! I'd give it 1/2 thumb up and advise all to skip it!"
5,A great read!!,Hannibal was great! It kept me on the edge of my seat and I never wanted to put it down. It was very suspenseful and had a very surprising ending. If you liked Silence of the Lambs you'll love Hannibal.
3,This was a three course meal when we could have had 5!,"Is it possible to count the many evils of not only Dr.Lector but also of Carlo, Mason, Pazi etc? Harris seems to try to hit every button to make you squirm. And, there in lies the problem. Too much gore and not enough score. And, come on, Mr. Harris, putting in your own political opinions regarding the Clinton saga. Cheap. The ending did seem unrealistic. Unless you believe that Lector has brainwashed Clarice. It's worth the read.....in paperback."
4,Very Different from 'Silence' but Excellent in its Own Way,"Those expecting a cookie-cutter sequel to Silence of the Lambs will be disappointed, but this book has other things to offer. The language is beautiful, especially during the time spent in Florence. And we finally get a small glimpse into Dr. Lecter's own background. Call me an oddball, but I like Hannibal Lecter! He isn't your garden variety serial killer who preys on innocent people on a whim. He mostly chooses to kill rude, horrible people with whom he is well acquainted or kills for self-preservation. (I'm not defending his actions but can't lump him in with maniacs who randomly choose their victims.) The ending is not what you would expect but I thoroughly enjoyed it! Can't imagine how they would make it into a movie, but if they do they had better cast Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins--no other 2 actors would do."
3,Sequels are never better!!!,"I am an avid Hannible fan. As I was tearing through the pages waiting for the story to get better.....it didn't. Although Harris has a wonderful imagination and he sure didn't put it to use in the books ending. It was TERRIBLE. I recomend everyone to read this book, but is sure isn't another SILENCE. Wait for the softback."
1,A mega let-down!,"This sequel is an insult to the prior two books. If this plot is all Harris can do with his wicked but fascinating Dr. Lechter, he should have given his creative juices another decade to distill before bringing him back. Then,again, perhaps he should have stopped with ""Silence"". Less is more in this case."
2,Heart Stopping Chills Killed By Insidious Ending...,Had me by the hairs on the back of my neck. Hannibal is every bit as unpredictable and evil as ever. Love Clarice Starling again in this book though she takes a back seat to Hannibal. But HORRIBLE HORRIBLE ENDING. UNACCEPTABLE ENDING. RUINED THE WHOLE BUILD UP. PREPOSTEROUS.
2,"Good audiobook, but....","I listened to the unabridged audiobook version of HANNIBAL, read by Daniel Gerroll. I have to admit that when the first tape started, Gerroll's voice wasn't one I thought would be suitable for this book. I quickly changed my mind, though, and eagerly anticipated each time I got into the car and could listen to this book. Gerroll did an excellent job with the different voices, accents, and vocal impediments of the characters that I almost forgive how wrong the ending of this book was for the story and its characters. Yes, it was gruesome and gory, but I felt the ending was just plain wrong. I've been a big fan of Harris in the past, but he just lost me with this one.At least I can say I enjoyed Gerroll's reading and will look for more readings from him."
2,Very Disappointing! Lack Luster!,The author provided such compelling details about the characters and the plot but gave a very weak ending. Good build up but not a good close which ruined the whole experience.
3,can one feel empathy for a person who ate a woman's face,"Feel let down that we must know what truly moved Lecter to his deadly deeds. Intersting tho, that it included WW2. Whatever his motivation, he did eat the face of an innocent nurse. Remember? Let that recall be a numbing moment in the read. But where else could Clarice and Hannible go but together into the night? I feel almost short-sheeted by this easy end. Hannibal is now a sex symbol, someone women should find ultimately attractive, ultimatley seductive? Pump me full of drugs before I watch my nemesis eaten. Is that the excuse for Clarice letting go of everything she felt so sure of? Was her beauty the driving force? What if Clarice was no beauty? What is she was common? Drugs or not I do not believe it and yet I do. Wonderful read. Couldn't put it down but was so regretful that I read it. That's my review."
2,Not nearly as interesting as Silence Of The Lambs...,What a dissapointment. It is not bad for a casual read but lacks the texture of Thomas Harris earlier books. The plot is inconsistent and the characters are sketchy at best. I hope the next Harris yarn is vastly more entertaining.
3,"This book was odd, but intriguing.","I though that Silence...was much better, but this book was very odd, very gory, and had a very surprising ending. If you liked Silence and Red Dragon, you will enjoy this book. It was a little slow at times but by the time I was 1/2 the way through, I couldn't put it down."
4,Hannibal is engrossing and at times utterly grotesque.,"In the years between Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal, Harris has changed his writing style. Hannibal is written in an omniscient voice which can be distracting. Harris's sabbatical in Italy greatly influenced this book. Be prepared for lots of Italian! It is a good read, but I found the ending disturbing and not believable in terms of the characters' morality. I hope the movie will take a different turn."
1,4 characters in search of an editor.,"Pompous, pretentious, pitiful! I have read many of the reader reviews - they were a far better read. I will not see the movie, nor read a future book. Disappointing drivel.Unfaithful (to say the least) to the characters he created.Try ""Certain Prey"" (John Sandford) this is an author whose sequels stand up to the originals."
4,"Not what you expected, but that's what makes it so good","'Hannibal' fleshes out the main characters better than any of the other novels. Clarice's true character is finally fully revealed; just like the metamorphosis of Lecter from 'Red Dragon' to 'Silence of the Lambs'. Some people may disagree with Clarice's transformation, but I couldn't image it written better. Lecter himself is also fully realized as you see into his past and possible motives.The only misses by the author would have to be the real villians of the novel, Mason Verger and his cronies. Their exploits dragged an otherwise very impressive book down."
2,To much Hype,"Hannibal was on okay read. I was expecting a bit more. I also had some problems on how it was writen. It seems that at times there was a narraitor telling the story, then at times it was as if it was in thrid person. I also didn't like the ending, even though someone told it to me. Over all it wasn't that bad. I'd say read it if you have nothing better to do and you can get it in paperback."
3,I know how the good Dr. feels....,"So, after all the horrors witnessed by Dr. Lecter, from his troublesome childhood, to brilliant insanity, to being locked in that windowless Baltimore dungeon for so many years, what *is* it that finally makes him scream aloud?-- Flying transatlantic coach next to a screaming baby and a fidgety preadolescent. Hey Doc, I been there too; I feel your pain.Harris is a powerful writer, and the books is fraught with images that stuck with me for a while: a flashback to Lecter's childhood. An unusual meal towards the end. I shan't spoil these scenes with details, suffice it to say that their vivid descriptions and, um, ""creative"" scenarios left me a tad green. But overall, such things are what I expected from the novel, and I wasn't disappointed. ""Silence"" is a hard act to follow... even for Mr. Harris."
2,Hannibal Goes Nowhere!,"I purchased Thomas Harris' book ""Hannibal"" after reading the celebrated ""Silence of the Lambs"" years earlier (which I thought was good but over rated). Hannibal starts off well. The writing style at times is a little un-even but the story engages. The descriptions of Florence and other copious asides was interesting, but not relevant to the story and made for a lot of fluff. As the novel pushes onward to it's unpredictable yet predictable climax, I felt a little ""ripped-off."" Agent Sterling's ambiguous laconic character left much to be desired. In reality, she would definitely be gay and more interesting as a person if this were so. As the ending approached, I had a strong feeling of being let down. Although my sense of what Mr. Harris was trying to communicate is that in reality people are never what they seem to be. Too bad it was done in such a round about and uneven way."
5,This may Shatter You,"In the 3rd installment of the Lecter plot, Thomas Harris gives us something to challenge us with: the dynamics are not good guy versus bad guy, more on the lines of bad guy versus bad guy who has the help of a good guy. The ending will leave you dazed, possibly. It is obvios, even from a cursory glance, that a truckload of time and effort went into the making on this thing- it shows in the developing relationship of Lecter and Starling. Some may be horrified at just how much that relationship blossoms; as for myself, I was in love too. Approach it with dread, sieze it with awe- it is a rewarding reading expierience that will leave you thinking and mesmerized. Have a good day, if after reading this that is possible."
1,It can't get any worse than this!,"Hannibal is, by far, the worst book I have ever wasted my time on. I couldn't wait for this book to come out so that I could continue to read the wonderful Trilogy that Thomas Harris started with the great ""Red Dragon"" and even better ""Silence of the Lambs"". To me, it read as if he wrote the book at the last minute over a long weekend and the editors didn't have time to do their job because they had a deadline. Several reviewers have complained about the ending, but in my opinion, the ending is a merely a continuation of the mindless drivel that started with the first page. One star is too good for this piece of pulp fiction garbage!"
3,"Couldn't Put it Down, but Didn't Stay With Me","I admit, as soon as my friend finished this book, I snatched it up and began reading. And finished it pretty much the same day. And yes, bits and pieces of it are memorable, particularly the climax (which will probably be the world's worst kept secret by the time the movie comes out)--I certainly haven't forgotten that. But the slow build and creepy moods and masterful characterizations of RED DRAGON and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS are nowhere to be found here. I've heard that Harris had this manuscript published as he submitted it, with no editorial changes--it shows, and not in a good way. The writing is self-indulgent and over the top and turns Hannibal Lecter into a caricature of himself."
2,Did someone rush you?,"After reading Hannibal, I couldn`t shake the feeling that there was some kind of deadline in place here. After a great beginning,it seemed that the further along you got into the story, it felt as if Mr Harris was just in a hurry to get it over with. And that, to me , robs both Dr.Lecter and Clarice Starling of much of the qualities given to them in Silence of the Lambs.I would have loved to have seen a completely different ending than what was seemingly tossed out here."
3,"""You Dont Want Hannibal Lecter In Your Head""-Jack Crawford","Overall, I expected more from Hannibal. Red Dragon and Silence were much better books. Lecter loses some of his creepiness in Hannibal and Harris' ending suffers from being just too incredible. It appears that Harris only creates Starling to be the victim of all men whether they be serial killers or cops. I expected more from Starlings character and was disappointed in Harris' treatment of her. There were faint glimpses of Harris' earlier achievements, but Hannibal was a step in the wrong direction."
1,RUN - DON'T WALK AWAY FROM THIS TRASH.,"I couldn't wait to read Harris's new book - THINKING it would be as great as Silence of the Lambs. Boy, was I mistaken. What a waste of my time. The ending is totally unbelievable - well actually the whole book was unbelievable, predictable - except the ending. What a great disappointment. If you haven't read it yet, don't waste your time. Total garbage."
1,Very disappointing,"I found this very disappointing. Rather pretentious and not a good effort, in my opinion. Don't bother."
1,what a let down!!!!!,"I spent the first 100 pages on the edge of my seat, the next 200 trying to stay awake, and the last 50 laughing uncontrollably. The ending of this book gave me the impression that Harris gave up on the characters and just wanted to finish. The ending is ludicrous. Other than as a guide to pig breeding or a roadmap of Florence, the book is a waste of time."
3,"Interesting in a very wordy, terribe ending sort of way.","The very first review sums this book up really well. I had no trouble getting into this book and was hooked after the completion of the first chapter. The small amount of emphasis on Starling was a little disappointing. When we were in Italy with Lecter, there was too much information and terms that are beyond most people's understanding. And I think we spent too much time with the Italian officer and his plans to get Lecter. The end was terrible and ridiculous. It left me sitting for hours asking, ""What the heck? Who would ever think that one up?"" It's a good read, but set yourself up for disappointments in Italy and the end."
1,Disappointing,"I keep hoping that this book would live up to its two predecessors, Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. Every once in awhile it offered a glimmer of hope in that direction but sadly it never came even remotely close to making the mark as it was often labored and the ending absolutely pathetic!!!!!! Please spare us a movie sequel!!!!"
1,Who is using Thomas Harris's Name and writing books?,"I was forced to read ""Red Dragon"" by my mother who thought it was the best book ever. I agreed with her and kept my doors locked at night. Also stopped using my 8mm camera for family events...Only kidding. I eagerly awaited ""Silence of the Lamb"".....Outstanding is all I can say. It kept me awake for hours just to finish it. I now have waited all of these years for ""Hannibal"". What a waste of time, money and paper. Wait until you can pick it up in a USED Book store and even then I wouldn't waste my money.How in the world could Harris think we could actually believe that Starling would end up that way?Is he more insane, than Hannibal?It also seem as if he had a deadline to reach and just finished the book off with gibberish to get it to print. DON'T WASTE MONEY ON FULL PRICE."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this novel the day it was released at the bookstores. Like many, I had anxiously waited to read the sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs."" This book was slow in the beginning, middle and end. The first half of the book contained too many Italian words, I mean way too many. If there is a movie lets hope they change the ending, it was just too silly."
1,I've never dreaded reading a book before,"I'm a quick reader, but I just couldn't get through this book. Instead of not being able to put it down, I just couldn't get myself to pick it up. I began dreading each next paragraph. Finally I decided to stop pushing myself to read it, so I don't know the ending and I don't care. I loved Silence of the Lambs, but this book was just too gruesome and boring for me."
2,Extremely disappointed,"While I thoroughly enjoyed Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs this book took me about 200 pages to really get into & start to enjoy and then when it got to the end I was extremely disappointed and thought that the last page would say something to the effect of it ""being a dream sequence""! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! Hannibal & Clarice, a couple !!! What nonsense"
2,Hannibal,"I've just started this book and already I'm tired of the endless cliches and movie script like quality. I'm disappointed by the what I felt was the genius of Thomas Harris. With his other books he quickly had me feeling empathy for both the victims and villans. In Hannibal, I can't quite figure out who is worse, the contrived Starling (she didn't seem to be the first person she was in the other novels) or the villans. I was hoping for a page turner...instead I've purchased a page burner! This book is wasting my time, and for my loyalty to the author I will finish it anyway...after all, what's a good movie without a script?"
3,The ending does not follow the story...,"This is the first Thomas Harris novel I have read. I saw Silence of the Lambs, loved it, and opted not to read the novel. When this novel was released, I immediately snapped it up.The whole story was excellent from the onset. Harris does a great job of further developing Dr. Lecter's character. You even find yourself sympathizing with the crazy ba$tard! It is truly a wild ride and worth the read.BUT, there is the ending. Although I could buy-into 70% of it, the ending as is does not jibe with the story or Clarice Starling. At least not for me. But, worth the read. Unless you are easily grossed out!"
2,Mr. Harris ... you need help,"Dear Mr. Harris, I read it to the end because I thought ... well ... ""maybe it's me, I've been a little distracted lately, I feel I should be enjoying this ... but I'm not"". What in the hell have you done to Clarice? Talk about a sell-out! And, what sort of mind can come up with that last scenario? Oh boy, I'd be worried if that had come out of my imagination. If the film is going to be true to the book, I will not be going to see it. I've given it two stars because I, at the very least read it until the end (and wish I'd skipped that last bit!)."
1,what a waste of time,"Why did thomas harris take so long to write such a jumbled, pointless and rambling book like this. You think if the man had spent so long on a book at least a few things would be evident. Simple things like a plot, a sense of intrigue and motives for the characters. This book lacks all the above. The whole time I spent reading this (time incidentally that was not well spent) I could not help thinking what is the point of all of this. The characters are shallow, Clarice especially. He seems to have run out of ideas for her and painted her as simply as possible. Even when I had finished the book, the same question repeated itself why? If you loved black sunday, red dragon & silence of the lambs please dont buy this! It sucks"
1,This book is TERRIBLE!!!!,Not in recent hisory has such a long-awaited work of fiction delivered such complete and utter disappointment. I thought I was getting a great deal buying this from Amazon at half price. I should charge Thomas Harris my hourly rate for wasting my time! I was profoundly disappointed by this book.
1,Out there ... Way out there,I'm thunderstruck that so many fellow readers have bought into Harris' tripe. Hannibal is a male fantasy that sets a new standard for the ridiculously absurd. Starling as Lector's star-crossed lover? I'd be more willing to believe President Clinton than this little fairy tale. Wake up people! One star for having Krendler for dinner: that was pretty cool.
4,controversial ending,"Say what you want about the ending. At least it wasn't a""safe"" ending, ...Perhaps there is a subtextual meaning tothe dreamy epilogue we just don't get. Or perhaps he is just setting up the next book, in which he Sets Things Right. It's hard to say at this point.Some readers are so emotionally conservative the over-react to an ending they don't know how to deal with and write an exaggeratedly negative review of the entire book, which isn't fair. Hannibal is mostly as thrilling as Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs. The stuff in Italy is brilliant, and the set up involving the nemisis is quite compelling. I don't see that much difference in literary style compared to the past Harris novels. I admit the ending is hard to swallow, but maybe it will make more sense when I read it a second time, or when the next book comes out."
2,Regretted Starting Hannibal,"This is one of those books that you can't put down once you've started reading it because you want to know the outcome. Unfortunately, every few pages you will be asking yourself why you are continuing to read this trash? It's a sick book."
1,What!,"What happened? Did Harris get writer's block toward the end of the book and knew he had a deadline? This was SO NOT even comparable to Silence of the Lambs. He must had a good day when he wrote that one! Don't buy this book, it is a total disappointment! No wonder, Jodie Foster will not be in the sequel, don't blame her at all!"
1,"IF YOU HAVE TO READ IT, WAIT FOR THE PAPERBACK!","""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" were so very good and I anxiously awaited the sequel, but I cannot remember ever being so disappointed in a book. The story becomes more unbelievable with each page - the last few chapters were just a joke and the ending leaves you feeling ripped off for spending the money on a hardcover edition. Harris should be embarrassed for offering such crap to his loyal readers. And where were his editors? Didn't someone along the way tell him how bad this was? I am considering writing the author and asking him to refund my money."
4,"A great read, definately chilling...interesting ending","I only hope that whomever makes the movie spends enough to do it right. I fear that it could quickly turn into a bad film. Dont read it late at night alone, like I did, unless you have solid nerves. I didn't care for all the Italian history which made it wordy at times. The ending was not predictable, and maybe not believeable, but I cant think of anything better. I agree with most of the negative comments too, but overall I loved it."
3,Not as good as Silence or Red Dragon,"I did enjoy this book but not as much as its two predecessors in the series. I didn't find the ending plausible and I didn't enjoy the occasional ""fly on the wall"" narration. I wonder how some sections will be adapted to film especially the inner thoughts of Hannibal which were so essential to the book."
2,I was extremely disappointed with Hannibal.,"In anticipation of the publishing of ""Hannibal"" I read ""The Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" again so I could get continuity of the character. I don't think Mr. Harris should have waited 11 years between ""Silence.."" & ""Hannibal"". I can't even begin to express how disappointed I was. The whole premise was rediculous and the ending was absurd. I will not recommend this book to any of my friends."
1,Don't even think about reading this one,"What a waste of time. Harris takes two very interesting characters of Hannibal and Clarice and ruins them. I think Mr. Harris was either hurting for money or was under pressure to write a sequel to ""Silence of the lambs"" (a very good book), because this book is a poorly pieced together hunk of rubbish. I've read all three books in the Hannibal series and the second, ""Silence..."" is the only good one. In this book, Harris should have focused less on the little insignificant details that have little to with the plot and put that time into developing a plot that was worth something. Let me say this about the ending, it almost seems like Harris is intentionally writing an ending to make his readers mad. This ending is so stupid Harris seems to be saying ""HERE-I wrote a stupid sequel for you so leave me alone!"" Avoid this book as if it were the plague. Shame on you Thomas Harris for ever writing this."
1,never mind truffles a load of waffle,Be prepared for shopping lists that read like a Danielle Steeleguide to what the rich spend their money on - isn't Hannibal tastefuleveryone? Be prepared for purple (the colour is over mentined as it is) descriptions of Florence that bear little relation to the actual city - didn't I spend my advance having a good time in Europe everyone? I don't think Anthony Hopkins would be willing to play *this* Hannibal in a million years and remember he *was* prepared to do Zorro! This book would be greatly improved by taking an arbitary number of pages from the back and ripping them out.
1,STINKOLA! A huge disappointment for a Harris fan-ME!,Several reviewers have beat me to the best lines about how bad this book is....but it is amazing that any book could be so gross and so boring at the same time. I loved Silence of the Lambs and was afraid that the sequel would not measure up....but the ending to this book is soooo awful and downright silly I don't know if to laugh or cry! I will definitely not be lined up for any more Harris books if this is the future of his writing. Save your money and time folks..there are a lot of books more worthy than this hunk of junk.
1,TERRIBLE,"I think that this is a horrible book. Thomas Harris wrote a horrible sequel. Silence of the Lambs was wonderful, along with the movie, but this book was a disappointment. I read many books but this had to be one of the worst that I have ever read. He really let you down with the characters, and with the ending."
5,sweetbreads anyone?,"I'm amazed at the amount of negative criticism this book has gotten on the sole basis of its ending -- which, by the way, I found extremely consistent and fun. This isn't a book for the slice-and-dice crowd. Rather, it offers a wider and deeper context in which to understand that monsters can turn human -- and vice versa -- with very little help. By the way, I'm thrilled to know that at some point in the story I happen to be living four blocks away from Dr. Lecter! There goes the neighborhood..."
2,i had hoped for more...,"After Silence of the Lambs, I expected more from Thomas Harris and Hannibal. This read more like a Mad Magazine parody, with cartoonish characters. I'm especially disappointed with Mr. Harris' treatment of Clarice Starling. She deserved better...and we all deserve a better book than we're gotten with Hannibal. I can't recommend this book, but I'll recommend a better one...Deception in the RainShadows by Riley St. James...a great mystery with credible characters and a thrilling plot."
2,A let down after Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs!!,"A VERY big let down after Red Dragon and Silence. The ""Hannibal"" books seem to lose something with each title. The best of the three by far is Red Dragon. The ending of Hannibal is HORRIBLE!! Save your money!"
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I was so looking forward to this book. I enjoyed ""Silence of the LAmbs"". Harris took so long to come out with the sequel, ow could it not be terrifc.What a disappointment. The main bad guy, Verger, is more annoying than scary. Lector's personality is not developed at all the way it was in ""Lambs"". He has matured into a benign person.The ending with Starling and Lecter was so poor I wanted to throw the book away.I am so sorry I bought the hard cover.. . a complete waste of time and money."
3,What the heck?,I thought the book was very well done in tying the original story to it. I got a little lost and dis-interested in the Italian setting. I can see the relevance of some of the side stories in Italy but I thought it went into much too much detail. This will make a very interesting and entertaining movie. The ending...well.. I just don't know about that.
1,It was a waste of my time and my money!,"I was very dissapointed in this book. It seems to me that Thomas Harris only wrote this book so that there would be a sequel to ""The Silence Of The Lambs."" Now that was a book that I could not put down and this is one that I had trouble picking up. I only finished it so that I could fairly review it. If you have not bought it don't waste your time and your money. The author could of done much better. I was truly dissapointed."
1,It's called: A screenplay,"The publisher should be hanged. If all the industry wants out of this ""writer"" is a screenplay for a lousy movie, why not ask him to ""write"" a screenplay and be done with it. Ack!"
2,"Build me up, let me down.","Wow, the ending was a real let down. As I approached the ending, I was hoping for it to be a dream (like on Dallas). Barney's involvement was thin and Clarice's Daddy-like devotion to Lector was cornball at best. Foster will never do the movie! The ending would have to be re-written in order for this story to fly. Read this one with a bit of caution. Don't aim high and you will not be disappointed."
1,Please!,I am so sorry that I read this book. It has changed and cheapened the quality of the characters that have continued from the earlier books. I will not buy another book by this author
1,Hannibal-Smannibal!,"I was so anxious to read this book. Being a fan of Thomas Harris' other books, I bought this one probably before the ink was dry! What a disappointment! It started out fine, but everything you loved about these characters from the other novel was destroyed. He didn't stay true to any of the characters and I can only say that I hope they freely change the movie (if they make one)."
1,Add me to the long line of Nay-Sayers,"Oh please, PLEASE, save us from authors tired of their characters and aiming only for that bonus check from Hollywood. Ponderous, confusing, stomach-churning (and that's just the prose, not the plot)...was I disappointed? You bet I was. As was my husband.We both agreed the end-game received short shrift. had Harris bothered to spend more time there and less time with Verger and his horrendous plot for revenge, I might have been able to accept the ending. Yes, yes...the bare bones of justification were there but I'm sorry Mr. Harris, it was not enough. You glossed over the details of Lecter's psychological seduction of Starling leaving most every reader bewildered at her abrupt personality change. Shame on you.For those of you who haven't yet wasted your time, don't bother. Go read something by John Sandford instead, or re-read SILENCE OF THE LAMBS."
1,"Terrible, depressing, disappointing unbelievable book","After waiting, along with all the other Thomas Harris fans who enjoyed ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"", for""Hannibal"", I was thrilled when a copy became available at my library. Alas, it was nothing like what I'd hoped. Unbelievable! I simply can't accept this story. This book was a huge disappointment."
1,Hannibal Bites!,"This is a book which started off with and consequently, maintained a high level of intensity. But, apparently the author got tired of writing it and decided it was time to go to bed. So...after ten years of working on a sequel to two excellent books, we are left with the most pathetic ending I've ever read. Hannibal is a complete waste of time."
1,Exceptionally Disappointing,"Hannibal has none of the terror and suspense of Silence of the Lambs. Thomas Harris writes this book with nothing more in mind that to see how much he can disgust the readers. The book is slow-moving and does not really capture your attention. I can truely understand why Jodie Foster has opted not to return to ""Clairce Starling."" I would do the same thing in her position."
1,Did Thomas Harris get bored?,"When I started on this book I was absolutely hooked, I practically read it straight through. But the ending was so awful it was painful. I heard a rumor that Jodi Foster refused to do the movie despite a record-breaking sum of money because her character was so pathetic. I don't know if it's true, but I don't blame her for a second if it is."
3,"entertaining, but not brilliant","Is it good? Well, yes, most of the time. Is it thrilling? Occasionally. Is it horrific? No, not at all. Where 'Red Dragon' left me looking over my shoulder after dark and 'Silence of the lambs' had my skin crawling, 'Hannibal' occasionally made me smile! The monster becomes human, and that's not a good thing to be happening to monsters. Sure, the book has it's gruesome moments. Lobotomizing one of your dinnerguests and frying & consuming his frontal lobes while he is still at the table is particularly nasty. But it happens to a person you want it to happen to anyway, and that takes half the horror out of it. I haven't decided yet wether the ending is very clever or totally ridiculous. Decide for yourself, if you want to. The book is worth reading if you've got a spare weekend, but no more than that."
3,Interesting but disappointing.,"After reading the first 100 pages, it dawned on me that this book is like reading a movie script. Thomas Harris knew before he wrote the book that it was going to be made into a movie, so why would he want to rewrite the book into a script?? I was lost in the Florence section, but thought it was an important piece. Silence of the Lambs was a much better story. I was extremely disappointed with the ending. This is one time where I hope the movie is better than the book!"
2,A promising begining that goes nowhere.,Having read the first two installments in this series I was ready for another thrilling roller coaster ride. Sadly this installment only proves that Harris is either unclear or totally unaware of why his two previous efforts worked so well. The book opens with promise but soon spirals down into a ridiculous conclusion that makes you wonder if Harris even understands the very characters he has created. Don't bother.
1,Very Disappointing,"I was so disappointed!..I expected to love this book, this author's name like some of my other favorites is enough to sell me on a book, site unseen..Sadly, I wish I had my money back, and I have learned my lesson...A reader in Denver suggests this book was a parody, and if we did not get it, the joke was on us, well, I am not laughing, and I bought what I thought was a 'thriller', not a parody...I am not a happy consumer.."
3,It's OK -- not great -- not horrible -- just OK,"Unlike many of the reviewers who have reviled the book, I enjoyed it. It was not engrossing or terrifying or anywhere near as good as ""Silence of the Lambs."" The key here is to not compare it to either ""Silence"" or ""Red Dragon."" The ending -- well, it certainly is not expected, although sadly predicted. It definitely is not of the caliber of Thomas Harris' two previous books."
1,Can't decide between revolting or plain bad,"It took Thomas Harris this long to write a substandard sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs""? The ending was so lame but then again it only was in keeping with the rest if the book. This really was an insult to the previous books"
3,"Good until part VI ""A Long Spoon""","The book started well and it really gets you going through this enigmatic Dr. Hannibal Lecter. It seems to me that Mr. Harris stop drinking or smoking what was inspiring him until Part VI of the book, where I just didn't understand anything. Don't know what happened to him. Very conusing. A mix of Rose Color end for a book that was delivering a catastrophic and bloody final."
1,"""Hannibal"" was this summer's biggest disappointment.","Pedestrian prose and a dumbed down Clarice Starling made this book a major disappointment to me, especially so at hardcover prices. ""The Red Dragon"" is still the scariest book I have ever read, but ""Hannibal"" is a real ho-hum. Don't waste your money; it'll be all over the used bookstore shelves in nothing flat."
2,NO SILENCE OF THE LAMBS!!!!!,"Sorry but Mr. Harris really falls short here. Way too unbelievable to even be entertaining. I was especially dissapointed in Clarice Starling's part, or a lack of one. Hannibal deserved better but in being a fan of his it makes it a must read."
4,It's no Silence of the Lambs.,"We can finally begin to understand Hannibal Lecter. The characterization is good. Lacks dark, brooding, scariness of Silence of the Lambs. While ending is delightfully sick, it is also rather anti-climactic."
1,SILLY!,"I can think of no greater disappointment than when one of the penultimate 'bad guys' of thrillers, Hannibal Lechter, ceases to be scary. In this sequel, we're meant to understand and empathize with Lechter because of his rotten childhood (puh-leeze! ) And Clarice is nothing more than a wimpy victim in this one. What happened to that heroic woman we loved in Silence of the Lambs? Oh, I wish that this one could be unwritten, so that my opinion of Hannibal, Clarice, and Thomas Harris could have remained intact!"
1,"Starling, Lecter Betrayed by Author",These characters would never behave the way they do at this book's end. Harris changes tense at a dizzying pace (even in mid-chapter) and clearly doesn't share the love of his characters that fans of his earlier works possess.
2,Hated Hannibal,"After Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal was a let-down. Most of the story line was very difficult to follow and I expected much more. The parts of the book that took place in Italy were poorly written."
3,Ridiculous ending,"I have not read the previous two Hannibal books but my sympathies go out to fans of the series, who have had to witness the carefully crafted characters of Starling and Lecter destroyed in the space of 30 pages by a completely ridiculous and unsatisfying ending. However, despite the ending it is still an entertaining read - one for the airport or journey to work."
2,What happened?,"I read the first two books of the Hannibal series and they were just amazing. I could not read them fast enough. And when I finally received Hannibal, I was excited to start it. But as I continued to read it took so long for the plot to build. The story line was not flowing. Mason's plan is not original. It is only towards the very end when the book finally picks up the pace and maintains the speed and suspense as Harris's previous novels.All in all, it is a very disappointing book."
1,Forget about it!!!!,"I, like every other reader who have read Mr. Harris' previous books, was waiting anxiously for the release of Hannibal. What a disappointment!!! I actually had to force myself to finish it. And the ending, what were you thinking Thomas!!! Did you really think that this ending was the only way to finish the book?"
2,A major disappointment.,"I had several problems with Hannibal. First, you absolutely had to have read SOTL to appreciate the characters. I dislike books that basically require you to have read an earlier novel (not an issue w/SOTL and Red Dragon). When this happens, I think the author gets lazy in character development: i.e Mason. His character was oversimplified: he didn't scare me that much, and we didn't learn enough about him. Lastly, I was blown away and very frustrated with the ending: was it drugs that changed Starling behavior, why would she possibly do it. I guess I don't understand enough about psychology."
4,Deliciously Wicked,"Kudos to Thomas Harris for not confining himself to writing a screenplay sequel. The complaints about this novel are largely unwarranted. The only one I have is about the very long interlude in Italy. It could have been shorter. I felt it was taking time away from the characters I was reading the book for in the first place; Hannibal & Clarice. The ending was so out of left field that I found myself totally accepting every word of it. Afterall, if the reader is willing to accept the cannibalistic superman that is Hannibal Lecter, why not this? My only question is, where did Will Graham go? Ultimately though, an exceptional, quirky ending to a remarkable trilogy."
5,I loved it!!!,"Contrary to what others thought about the book, I thought it was great (apart from the ending!) Quite different from the first book. I cannot wait to see the movie!"
2,Resting on his Laurels,"It seems apparent that Mr. Harris was counting on the success of the first two books to help him here. There is a very weak plot, poor character development and a really poor, weak ending. My only hope is that they do not make this dull book into an even duller movie. Anthony Hopkins beware!!!"
1,Wish I could give it NO stars,"I really enjoyed Harris' three previous books, but what a disappointment this was. No substance but plenty of gore, in fact it seemed to me that Harris was seeing how gross he could get. No supsense, no mystery, just ""can you top this for disgusting..."" excess. Sadly, too, not a single character with any redeeming qualities. I finally gave up half way through. I asked my husband how it ended and was glad to put it away."
3,Five stars until the ending!,I found this book to be great up until the ending. I do have to give Harris credit for his creative and twisted ending. When I first put the book down I felt great disapointment but now that some time has passed I am beginninmg to agree more so with the ending that he choose.After reading some of the previous reviews on this site here are my comments:Harris is a great writer people and there is no need to criticize his work so harshly. I think that he composed a wonderful sequal although it could have been better.Worth reading for sure
4,"Nerve-wracking, thrilling, compelling, unpredictable","I bought this because I am a huge fan of SOTL and Thomas Harris. I can't decide if it is Anthony Hopkins or Dr. L. who fascinates me so much. No matter...I found the book nearly impossible to put down. Very rarely am I actually emotionally shaken by a book. I was OK until the final chapters, then....WHEW!! Many people will be disappointed in the ending...but no one could ever admit to foreseeing how it would turn out. Too many novels are predictable...this one most definitely is not.. The sheer evil of the characters is so frightening, it makes one wonder if the world indeed has people like that in it. And what is so scary is knowing that it most likely does. Part of me can't wait for the movie... even though I don't see how the screenplay could ever be true to the book without an NC-17 rating at best. Loved it!"
2,Disappointing,"Like the other Harris fans, I have been anxiously awaiting this story for years. Like the other fans, I wanted to love it. I expected to love it. But, loath as I am to admit it, I do not love it. The characters I met in this new novel are not the ones I knew from the previous ones. They are strangers. Their behavior does not follow from what we know of them. The book seems to have been hastily thrown together, which is strange considering the length of time since Silence. Typos suggest it wasn't even proofread with much care. Whatever the case, I will always remain in awe of Harris for The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs."
3,"Started well, ended in a disappointing way","The beginning of the book started well and continued well, however, the ending left me very disappointed. It was not a believable way the main character would have ended up. I got the feeling the author wanted to hurry up and finish the book to meet a deadline."
2,Think of Lost World or the Last Don,"Just as Mario Puzo, the genius who gave us the Godfather also produced the Last Don and Michael Crichton followed Jurassic Park with Lost World, Thomas Harris has taken what was a stellar record and added a severe blemish. Dislikable characters, implausible plot turn after implausible plot turn and absurd ending and you have a real dud.JODI and ANTHONY if you are reading this, take my advice, do not agree to make this movie, do not give this a second life, let it die or get someone else to play the parts.This book needs to be priced more than 50% off for you to get your money's worth."
2,What was he thinking?!?,"The brilliance of The Silence of the Lambs was the mental connection between the two main characters - the ""quid pro quo"". Unfortunately, Harris has written a storyline that keeps Hannibal and Starling apart until the very last scenes."
2,In a word? Stupid.,"What a shame that Harris wasted the terrific characters he introduced in Silence (and Dragon) and dragged us through what I'd call one man's love affair with Italy. Sadly enough, the only time I detected some excitement in Harris' writing was when he described the buildings and streets of Florence, Italy. Otherwise he threw Clarice Starling and Hannibal to the pigs (literally). By the time the finale rolled around, the only thing I was interested in finding out was what wine the doctor was serving with dinner! (Note to author: You and Patricia Cornwell need to get together some time and talk about Italy. She can wax ecstatic over its cuisine and you can ramble on about its architecture and history. That way you can get it out of your system and your readers won't have to suffer through pages of the stuff waiting to find out what became of the main characters.)"
1,Very Disappointed by Hannibal,"I have been a faithful reader of Mr. Harris until now, I will no longer assume he will write at a level of quality, as he has in the past."
4,"Gripping,Grusome,Surprising,Superb!","This long awaited sequel did not erase the image of Anthony Hopkins as the supergenius, phychologist, cannibalistic serial killer.The suductive madness of this charcter is unforgetable.I was gripped,frustrated,and ultimately surprised by the events following the silence......of the lambs.The book had one more effect on me, one that distubs me a little... It left me hungry....."
4,I love a good read that you can't put down--and this fit.,"As a lover of these gory dramas, I couldn't wait to get my hands of Hannibal. Once I started, I couldn't put it down. I look for a total suspension of reality in my world (I'm retired with an unrelenting heart problem.) and for one brief moment I believed. Bring on more, Mr.Harris."
1,A bad parody of a Thomas Harris book.,"This book couldn't get published if it had been written by anyone but Thomas Harris. It's truly awful. The first four-fifths or so of the book read like a sloppy, overheated police ""thriller"" -- dozens of which line the shelves of every airport bookstand. The final fifth of the book is bizarre. Imagine a couple of college freshman getting stoned and then trying to write a gothic romance, and you'll have some idea of just how bad the ending of this book is."
1,As disappointing as can be,"One star because I can't give a zero (or negative) rating. I cannot express my disappointment in strong enough terms. There's no character here worth caring about, the writing is poor, the ending is ridiculous. And the grammatical errors were very distracting. Are we sure this wasn't a book created by a room full of monkeys banging away on typewriters all day?"
1,I figured it out!,Harris is Lecter and we readers are the pigs devouring this book. I can only assume Mason Verger is the mangled myopic publisher who feeds Harris to the readers. What a clever little inside joke played on the victims who bought this book!
4,Fascinating end,Anyone who has read previous books by Thomas Harris has to read this thriller.. It beats all his others but maintains the same characters in this story so he has you saying oh so that's so and so from the other book. Blends beautifully from Silence of the Lambs. I highly recommend this book to lovers of mystery and suspense.. I enjoyed it. The ending was a real surprise!
4,"Excellent, but no better than Silence of the Lambs","I enjoyed this book immensely, especially the detailed descriptions and background that Harris incorporates into the story. Those who dislike this book are too dependent on the film version of Silence of the Lambs and have only a narrow vision of Harris' work. The depiction of Lecter especially in this book was much more favorable than I remember from Harris' previous works, and it was convincing enough that I found myself hoping for the slightly predictable ending. The true villain got his just desserts(pun definitely intended), and the antihero pair got theirs."
1,I was rooting for the pigs...(hey! That's a pun!),"I thought this book was a bit of sham. It seemed that Harris couldn't decide whether Lecter was just a poor misunderstood elitist/genious or the devil. Mason Verger was properly portrayed as the real monster, but I just can't get a firm picture of his she-hulk sister. Overall, a major disappointment."
2,irratatingly fascinating,"I thought this book was going to be a work of art, really, until I got to the ""Florence"" section then realized later that the ""Florence"" section meant ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to the denoument of the story!A breakthrough beginning for Clarice, Harris makes you see that she is tough and strong-willed... which makes the end remarkably odd, in my opinion. It was almost as if Harris was put under a deadline and came up with a quick and ill-advised ending to an unusually planned out story.After you have read the last page, you find yourself wondering ""was this supposed to have been good vs. evil?"" Who is the antagonist? Who is the protagonist? And I am wondering if Thomas Harris really meant for the reader to see it that way."
1,If you loved Silence of the Lambs DO NOT read this book,"I found Hannibal's new life somewhat interesting, but not at all what I expected. I truly expected a few more snacks along the way. Mason Verger's character? Too horrifying and unbelievable. Why would anyone serve him in the way they did? He'd be nothing to bump off. But then, the book would be a few hundred pages short.But I was most upset with was what happened to Clarice Starlings character at the end. What was the author thinking? To shock us? Disgust us? This is one book where the movie HAS to be better. But why take the chance, skip them both."
1,Absolutely unbelievable story,"This book was a huge disappointment, and not even close to Harris's previous books. ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" were both excellent - this thing is just absolutely terrible. I think Harris has fallen in love with his Lector character, who is a cannibal and a murderer, and can't bear to give him up to his just desserts. The way this book ends is disappointing and so awful and unbelievable that it made the rest of the story seem like nothing but a set-up. Frankly, I hated the thing."
3,Godless. A story about greed in the extreme.,"It wasn't until the last 8 pages of the book that I realized what Thomas Harris was actually writing about: The corruption of all by greed, and the loss of God and any societal relevance in the process.No major character (and practically no one at all) escapes the influences brought about by greed, mostly by money. None exhibit the usual concerns about society that are learned through religious and cultural exposure. Was this Harris' point? I was disturbed by the utter lack of social conscience, with all 10 or 20 major characters - even Starling - driven by the prospect of personal gain and personal gain only.The ending was unexpected. There are also holes in the details. All in all, however, the book is a worthwhile and easy read, with much of the real gore left to the imagination. It could have been much worse."
2,A true sequel...,"...disappointing in every way. Flat, unbelievable characters; ridiculous situations; hare-brained schemes. Harris's (former) genius was that he could take the unimaginable and make us picture it. But not this time. I rolled my eyes too many times.The openng sequence read like a novelization of a bad movie, as if Harris had merely watched some Joe Bob Briggs fave and faithfully transcribed it--without adding any insight into characterization or motivation, or even the attention to revealing detail that made RD and SOTL horrific and yet believable.I'll no longer have nightmares about Dr. Lecter coming to eat me, because I no longer believe in him. And that's a darn shame."
1,"Worst sequel since ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls""","Harris is a ""One-trick pony"". Harris wrote the same book twice, in ""Silence"" and ""Red Dragon"". Now we know why. I will sell my copy of Hannibal for 25 cents. NO REFUNDS! The characters are completely without consistency, the plot far-fetched. Harris should have named this book, ""Take the Money and Run."""
1,Save your money and your time!,"I loved the previous books by Thomas Harris and couldn't wait to buy Hannibal...I should have. This was a mess....mixing of third and second person in the writing; wandering sentences; characters losing their characterizations; and an ending ... well that I just couldn't stomach.My own imagination created a better tale than this and I really feel betrayed....it was as if Harris felt he had to give us ""something"" ...better if it had been ""nothing"" .... because this was less than nothing."
1,Pornographic trash,"I have no idea what the professional reviewers above are talking about. Certainly they are not refering to Hannibal. This book begins well, then degenerates into the most pornographic (and I do mean graphic) trash I have ever had the misfortune to read. I also get the impression that Harris did not want to write this novel. The writing is uninspired, the conclusion repulsive. The characters' actions are nonsensical. I am no prude. I thoroughly enjoyed the first two novels, but this I have removed from my home. It is just wretched."
2,"Real crime was great, but horror is just ... horrible","How one Earth could Mr Harris hope to follow his two earlier successes? The serial killer theme, which he reached ahead of every one else, was a popular literary gold mine. Such new material does not come along every day, or even every decade. So Harris stuck to his guns and, after years of pacing up and down, churned out more of the same - except that it wasn't the same. RED DRAGON and SILENCE were based on real cases. That was what made them so startling. And it excused the horror, because it we knew these things had really happened. In this book Harris spirals off into pure horror fantasy. No real cases this time, just the author's imaginings pushed to the limit of nastiness. The result is a pale shadow of his earlier work: indulgent, lurid, exploitative. Well, I guess that was a hell of a lot easier than coming up with new, well-researched, factually-based material."
2,"If you have to buy Hannibal, wait for the paperback!",I waited a long time for the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs- and I should have waited a lot longer. I was angry as I forced myself to finish this story but I found some comfort at having bought it at a 50% discount. If I had paid full price I would have sent it back to the publisher and demanded the return of my money. Silence of the Lambs is a great novel because it is scary and believable. Hannibal is a poor novel because it is neither scary nor believable.
1,this is awful!!!,"Always have been an ardent fan of Thomas Harris..discovered him long before the critics and filmmakers..but Hannibal is an LSD dream gone bad! 200 pages into this 486 page book, I have just about surrendered. Poorly constructed and organized. locales changing from city to city,country to country almost constantly; characters entering the story and leaving almost instantaneously; our Ms Starling of the FBI,a fascinating character in Silence of the Lambs disappears on page 97 of Hannibal..ever to return? If one reads the critics..this is a book of near epic proportions,enhancing the author's reputation. Makes one wonder..what book they have been reading???"
1,Should have waited for the paperback.,"For the first time in several years I bought a book before it came out in paperback. My mistake. Hannibal was a major disappointment. The characters were cartoonish and the plot was thin. Also, the narrative portions and the ending were surreal. Too bad Hannibal Lecter didn't sautee my book with a tenderloin before I wasted my time reading it."
2,A Definite Dissapointment,"I can't believe after reading 400 pages of great character development that the last 100 pages would reverse itself into the cheesy plot of a daytime soap. ACK! Was Mr. Harris pressured to finish the book? We'll never know. What we do know is this book should not be put on the shelf next to his earlier work. When they make this into a movie, they WILL change the ending, unless Susan Lucci is starring!"
3,Fascinatingly chilling - last 5 chapters were disappointing.,"Started off and continued up to the last 4 or 5 chapters to be a worthy sequel to Silence of the Lambs. I felt the book should have ended earlier and would still have left the reader satisfied but wanting more. The last few chapters were ""hokey"" and added nothing and nowhere to go from here."
4,"Great Story, Mediocre Ending","This is the first one of Harris' books that I have read, having only seen ""the Silence of the Lambs"", and getting introduced to the good doctor that way. I thought the first 430 pages or so of the book were great, but what a strange ending. Seemed very out of character for Starling to do something like that. Think there will be a sequel to this one? I'm not sure what Harris has been doing for ten years, but I hope for his sake it was not concentrating on the ending of this book. I would probably reccommend it to others. Looking forward to reading Red Dragon, as I have been told it's the best one."
3,Left me feeling conflicted,"A fan of Harris' earlier novels - Black Sunday, Red Dragon and 'Silence' - I had hoped for another. The characters were finely drawn as usual - I loved hating Verger - but the ending was a gyp. It felt like Harris didn't know what to do so he did what he did. Also, I'm not sure I wanted insight into why Lecter was Lecter - the whole point of the previous novels in the series being that he was undefinable. So read it to enjoy Harris - but don't expect to be satisfied by the ending."
2,Disappointing followup to Red Dragon and Silence of the Lamb,"I admit that I awaited this book as eagerly as a million other people, and I was disappointed! I have read 17 other reader reviews before I wrote this, so I will not repeat what several of the ""one star"" reviews said, since I basically agreed with them. Red Dragon was a terrific book and a very underrated movie(Manhunter). I didn't like Silence as well, but obviously Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster made the book seem better than it was because of their movie performances. Hannibal is a letdown, the ending was disappointing and the last part of the book was stomach churning--Which I guess you expect with Mr Harris. I did read it in one day though!!"
1,avoid this book,"Thomas Harris seems to have lost all interest in Lecter and Starling, and instead of writing a sequel, he is written a parody. The book is more screenplay than novel, with only the visual sense employed for most of it. The new villians are frankly, terrible, not so much James Bond as Austin Powers.This book doesn't deserve to be made into a film. There's better fan fiction around than this."
4,Another wonderful spine chiller from Thomas Harris,"An astonishing reprise of the Hannibal Lecter legend which turns all pre-conceptions of character development inside out. Thomas Harris has the ability to take literary stereotypes and imbue them with characteristics most of us only have nightmares about. Harris has obviously decided that Dr Lecter is worthy of more attention as an (anti) hero and has created an even more reprehensible monster in the form of Mason Verger as Lecters nemesis. Buy this book and buy it now, but be prepared to be unable to put it down, really."
3,Sizzles then fizzles,"Great story-telling and suspenseful build-up, but the ending reads like it was pre-taylored for the silverscreen adaptation. Some beautiful scenery of Florence, Italy, but a weak follow up to the genious of ""Silence of the Lambs""."
2,Terribly Disapointing,It almost seemed as though the book was written to go directly to the big screen. There was a lack of character development and suspense. I'm glad to know that the ending of the movie is different than the book. This is one book that I can't wait to see the movie so I don't remember the book.
2,Main Character Interesting -- Ending Utterly Silly,"In our world of best selling drivel and paper thin plot lines, I was hoping to find in this author a much deeper semblance of character development. However, while Hannibal Lecter is arguably one of the most distinct individuals in our recent times -- the other characters are barely uncovered. Sure -- Starling is back and we do delve a bit into her past... but there isn't enough there to really associate with anyone in this book. To add to this pain, the ending makes absolutely no sense. I won't give it away -- but really... please... it isn't even a shocking ending -- it just happens. Oh well -- this was my first/last Thomas Harris book."
2,Wait for the softcover,"I know this won't be a popular review but when Hollywood puts this to film, I sure hope they come up with a better ending. Fiction or not, I couldn't buy into Lecter's personna as I did with ""Silence..."". You get the impression that Harris got writer's block 3/4 of the way through and that the only purpose of the ending was to lend itself to another sequel. Way too wordy at times. Harris inconsistently goes from third to first person narrative. Interesting but disappointing read. Little if any substance to Starling's character. In fact, there were too many characters, several of whom the story could easily have gone without! Perhaps Hannibal Lecter will go the route of Rocky Balboa. Hannibal IV, Hannibal V....."
2,I'm forcing myself to pick up the book and continue on!,"Oh, I don't know, maybe I over-anticipated after anxiously waiting all these years. With Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, those books were read in one day and re-read over the years. So far, not the same with Hannibal. Good points to this tale are the obvious research put into the life of Hannibal in Italy, but for the most part, the other characters have yet to make me give a hoot. Reading some of the other reviews here make me wonder if I'll even bother going the distance. (Oh, I will, but will probably regret it.)"
2,Disappointing,"I really WANTED to like this book, but I don't think it lives up to the previous works in this series. What I liked best about Harris' previous work was his cool detachment from the (ghoulish and horrible) characters and events he was describing. This detachment is nowhere in evidence this time around, with the second person intervals and his obvious affection for Hannibal. When Salon Magazine synopsis for 'Hannibal' I thought it was a hoax...surely Thomas Harris wouldn't deliver such a far-fetched mess! Alas, I was wrong. I enjoyed the book, but it feels like it was written by someone trying to mimic Harris' work without possessing his gift for elegant prose and (usually) seamless story lines. A sad disappointment."
1,Oh Dear!What a disaster!,I would like to know who MR HARRIS'S editor is because I can not blame a reclusive autor for believing he has created somthing worthwhile but surely a writer relies on his editor to just tell the truth.So let me do it.MR HARRIS this book is terrible. Your initial opening reads like a bad action movie. Your middle section is reasonable . You should have maybe based the entire book in Europe . But........oh dearie me where did you get your ending from. It is absolute tosh. I found myself laughing through the final 10 chapters and I presume this is not the reaction you were looking for.But hey you're rich and I'm not.You created RED DRAGON . Now that was good.Please buy all the copies of this book back from the general public and have them pulped.Ay Carumba Mr Harris what were you thinking about.
2,Wasn't worth the decade long wait!,"I was very disappointed. The writing, plot development, and especially the charater development, is inferior to Harris's other work. I am glad that I got it at 50% off."
3,"Good, but not as good as ""Silence of the Lambs""","Harris did as good a job as anyone could do in following up ""Silence of the Lambs"". But I wish he had done what I did in preparation for this book. I reread ""Silence of the Lambs"", just to update myself on Dr. Lector and to be able to move smoothly into the sequel. Harris apparently failed to take another look at his previous novel. There are several discrepancies in details which detract from the sequel's credibility."
2,"A star for insight into Lector, one for finishing the story.","As a fan of The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, I dropped everything to read this book. The story of Mason Verger and his pig procurers is so richly detailed and depraved it practically stands on its own, almost overshadowing the main story.I appreciated Hannibal's character more against the backdrop of his childhood. All through ""Silence of the Lambs"", I kept wondering how such monsters are made.Clarice Starling was given short shrift in this sequel. Harris writes about her in a flat and one-dminensional way, leaving her uninteresting and weak.I was very disappointed in the ending. I, along with those who will admit to it, was very curious about where the obvious mutual respect and interest would take Hannibal and Clarice, but the ending was totally unbelievable; worse, it tainted my opinion of the rest of the book because it was so outlandish. I was so underwhelmed that if a movie is truly in the works, I won't be seeing it."
1,extremely disappointing,"After waiting such a long time to read this book I was very disappointed. Had this book not been written by Thomas Harris I believe it would have gone totally unnoticed and unread. His previous books had you turning the pages as fast as you could to see what was going to happen next. The tone of this book was very weird and I kept wondering: OK, when will this start? There is very little action involving Clarice Starling and all of a sudden we are expected to see Dr. Lechter as a romantic idol? This was totally BIZARRE and just AWFUL. What a waste!!!!!"
3,"Extremely suspensful, graphic and disturbing, weak ending.","The book starts off strong and stays suspensful all the way through. There are some graphically disturbing scenes scattered throughout the book, seemingly more vivid than his previous books. The ending seemed not believable and somewhat contrived."
5,Harris creates something completely different.,"When I bought Hannibal I knew what I was expecting. I knew what I thought I could reasonably expect given the genre and dictates of story. This would be the third part of the Silence of the Lambs/Red Dragon saga. It would be well written and a part of the same tradition. I had always been impressed by Mr. Harris's brilliance but I was not expecting something completely original. What happens in this book with these characters is something I never expected to see in commercial fiction. So I'm at a strange loss-- Did I like the book? Yes. Was it a good book artistically? Yes. Do I recommend the book? Yes-with caution. This is not comfortable fiction of any genre. It's not pushing the edge of the envelope it is outside it. Not for the faint of heart, mind or stomach. It is nothing like you have ever read before and if you are starved as I am for something new and different Hannibal is a welcome treat."
1,Huge dissappointment,"I remember New Yorkers rushing out to bookstores the week Silence was released. Harris with Red Dragon had completely set the standard for this genre, and we weren't let down. Hannibal reads like it was written in the last few months, and Harris has obviously lost it. Bad storytelling and ludicrous ending, such a letdown."
5,Not for the formula horror writer fans,"I had nearly given up on Harris' return to the crime-horror genre; I'm glad I did not. What superb imagination and craftsmanship! Not since Hemmingway has someone written so ingeniously and so convincingly. ""Hannibal"" will certainly be made into a film, just as the highly unlikely and hugely successful, ""Silence...""."
1,Great Cold Weather Book!!!,"For those nights when the weather keeps you in, when a fire and a good book sound like the best way to spend the evening....use this book to start the fire and then go find a good book to read!! If you do decide to work your way through this one don't finish it....this book has a few pretty intriguing story lines but doesn't deliver. It almost seems as if there were two authors, Harris seems to have started the book, whoever finished it should be just that....finished!! I finished it out of morbid curiosity and then gave the book the burial it deserved....the garbage. Too bad I don't have a fireplace...it would have made great kindling!!! I give it negative five stars."
3,Great beginning-great middle-disappointing ending.,"The beginning and middle of this book were filled with captivating characters and events, but I didn't buy the ending. The Clarise I knew was a strong, motivated woman, but in the end, she turns into a sap. I think the whole brainwashing thing was ridiculous and unbelievable. The ending would have been more interesting if she had to weigh her inner feelings with how she felt about Hannibal and how to incorporate her thoughts into doing what was right. Should she let him go or should she bring him in? How will he try to manipulate her? Would he try to hurt her to get away or is does he still admire her enough to spare her, etc. The ending is too simple and too boring. It ruined a good book."
3,"Interesting, but ultimately disappointing...","Three quarters of the book was enjoyable. The interactions among the cast of characters and their single minded pursuit of Hannibal were quite fascinating and believeable. The most disappointing aspect of this book was the unbelievable and extremely disturbing resolution to the story. Surprise endings can be good, but they need to fit the picture drawn within the book. This ultimately missed the mark and jumped to an ending that just didn't seem possible based on what we knew of the characters."
1,Not up to expectations!!!,The author had an opportunity to take his character...Hannibal...from his previous SOTLs and write perhaps the novel of the decade. Instead he daudled in the inner-workings of the mind of the killer and lost the plot almost entirely. This book was certainly not up to his previous efforts.
1,Very disappointing,"While Mr. Harris has a great ability to bring to mind very graphic images, often without fully describing those images, it's not enough to write a great book. My expectations were far too high after reading SOTL. The beginning of this latest book was excellent - it captured my interest immediately. The rest of the story went along fairly but began to bog down. My biggest complaint was the end. It seemed as if Mr. Harris had written enough and said to himslf, ""Okay, time to end this one."" The ending is just too far-fetched for for me. The characters seemed way out of place in their roles. I don't wish to give away the ending of the book, but I'll say that it was not worthy of the rest of the story. I was extremely disappointed."
1,Sadly disappointed,"I read SOTL and was looking forward to reading the next installment. Hannibal is slow, self-gratifying, and the ending is completely ridiculous. If they decide to make a movie of this, I hope they hire a very good screenwriter with a new red pen."
2,"Lecter, Hannibal Lecter","What starts out as an exciting hunt for a serial killer on the loose ultimately degenerates to James Bond fantasy. Lecter goes from being a really, really ugly human to something akin to SuperHero. Of course, he never runs out of money, or out of luck. He is stronger than almost everyone he meets. He kills people cleanly and neatly in the middle of a crowded street. Why not strap him to a metal plate that is being cut in half by a laser? You know he'll get out of that one. No, no, no! Strap him to a big log that's being cut at a lumber mill. Wait a minute, how about having him blast off into space to hook up with his evil genetics experiments... Obviously, Thomas Harris enjoys doing his research in Buenos Aires and Florence more than rural Ohio and Louisiana. What the heck, who says a serial killer can't be chic?"
1,HUH,"I know what took Thomas Harris so long to write this book. He had to bribe Danielle Steele to finish the last three chapters!What a goofy book. Someone, please tell Mr Harris that he has no future as a romance novelist. And Hannibal as a movie? Well, only if you can get Fabio to play Lector, Charo as Starling and Dustin Hoffman as Tootsie playing Margot.Yes, folks, a comedy!"
2,"Completely unbelievable, almost entirely disgusting","Mr. Harris has managed to foist upon his readers a work that, while taking place in what must be a parallel universe, manages to have no, absolutely no, characters with any redeeming qualities. His characters are distinguished only by their monstronsity and the degree of their veniality. I suppose this sort of thing appeals to those who enjoy cheap horror films but I feel cheated out of the price that I paid. A shame, I enjoyed ""The Silence Of The Lambs"""
2,I got bored...,"After ""Silence of the Lambs"", I expected something dark, gritty and maybe a little gory. What happened was a lot of ""brainless"" violence, a strange story and an ending that is too screwed up for words.I'd say pass..."
2,Clarice Starling's character is the true victim of this book,"A horrible, unbelievable ending to a grotesque story. I wish I hadn't read this book."
1,Waste of time and money,"If, a year ago, you or I had submitted a manuscript such as ""Hannibal"" to Delacorte Press/Random House, we'd probably gotten a reply from one of their editors suggesting we'd seek professional help. But, hey, this book is by Harris... slice'em, dice'em, savor'em Harris. He probably spent his royalty checks sampling European deli counters and growing both his pté repertoire and his waist line. And that's OK... that's the book publishing business. If Hannibal doesn't meet expectations, and it didn't meet mine, then perhaps we ought to analyze our expectations. What on earth are we thinking Harris would do for us?"
3,Hannibal: An Exercise In Evil,"As I read through the many customer reviews of the novel, ""Hannibal"", I am struck by the overall disapointment in the author himself, Thomas Harris. It would not be easy to top ""Silence Of The Lambs"" (the novel, NOT the film!) and Harris falls short of that little masterpiece with his latest entry. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book. I also tend toward disapointment toward not dwelling more on Dr. Hannibal Lecter himself and not the repulsive Mason Verger. Maybe, Mr. Harris, you could write a prequel involving Dr. Lecter's many ""adventures"" before being locked in the dungeon asylum in Baltimore. I still recommend this book to anyone interested in evil and it's many domains."
3,Excellent....until the ultimate letdown in the end,"When I started reading 'Hannibal', I couldnt put it down. When I had read to the middle, I began proclaiming that it was the best book I had read so far. Then the ending came and left me thoroughly dissapointed. The build up of the intertwining lives of Hannibal Lecter, Clarice Starling, Mason Verger, his sister and all the other characters, though well developed, did'nt deserve to be so abruptly cut short as they had been in the totally unexpected and ridiculous ending that they recieved. It was very apparent that Mr. Harris did alot of research and took great pains to make this book as realistic and believable as possible. Then it seems he simply got tired of it and wanted to get it over with. Bottom line: You will absolutley love this book if you read it and stop at the last chapter and leave the rest to your imagination."
2,Thumb-licking page-turner with a milque-toast finale.,"At long last....this? While I must admit to near incoherence the next day at work (possibly due to staying up waaaay past my self-appointed bed time again and again in the course of one evening), I must also admit to confess the bitter disappointment that accompanied the hurried and somewhat lackluster ending. You can do MUCH better, Mr. Harris!"
4,Page turning gore-fest!,"Okay, so it's the weakest of the Hannibal Lecter trilogy, but it's still a mesmerizing read...never dull, often shocking. The gore factor is high and disturbing, but a guilty pleasure nonetheless. Unless you're prepared for a nightmare or two, not the book you'd want to read at bedtime."
2,"This should be called, ""The Violence of the Sham""","Sorry, but I side with the nay-sayers on this one.It starts off so promising, with Starling's fall from grace, the inroduction of a villian as evil as the Bad Doctor himself, and a really strong plot strand set in Florence.But then it devolves into voyeurism, camp melodrama, and Jacobean silliness that ultimately crash lands on an ending so preposterous that no amount of psychobabble could justify it. If Harris was ultimately trying to marginalize the characters he established with such clarity and vigor in the first two books, he succeeded beyond his wildest dreams in ""Hannibal."""
1,IS THIS ACTUALLY SELLING!,"I was so anxious to read Hannibal prior, but now... This has to be the most disappointing experience in my life. Ok, overstatement. Nevertheless, I would rather have not spent my money on this book. Paperback, yes... I'd rather read instructions on how to use a chia pet. We're all critics, aren't we?"
2,It's NOT Red Dragon,"I originally stumbled across Red Dragon in 1982 when I moved to St. Charles, MO about 1 mile from Highway 94 as described in Harris's original novel with Lector. The book was mesmerizing. Silence of the Lambs, though not as taut, still provided a good read. Hannibal was a fast but less than satisfying read. The characters were shallow, the story not believable, and the ending .... give me a break."
2,Disapointing,"I can't believe I waited 10 years for this crap. T. Harris should have is liver eaten with some fava beans and a bottle of warm genaric beer. A waste of time. Reread Silence or Red Dragon, both much, much better. Supposedly T. Harris got 9 million for the film rights. He is stealing money. If a movie is made that sticks to the storyline of this book, it will not make a dime. I would much rather see The Red Dragon remade into a movie that is faithful to the book. Too bad J. Demme did not do this one too. Micheal Mann's Manhunter(Red Dragon) was just an OK cop movie. I am not surprised that J. Demme dropped out directing the Silence sequel. A long wait for almost nothing!!!"
1,Horrible,"This book was a huge disappointment. I've been a fan of this series since Red Dragon, and was excited to read this novel. But it seemed like little effort was made to stay true to the characters. Clarice's character seems to be acting younger than when she was a student, and at the end of this book I thought she was a joke. I'm still angry that I spent so much money buying the hardcover version when it was first published."
3,Strange and Disappointing,"Having finally gotten a chance to read this book after borrowing it from a friend, I really must say 'Hannibal' was kind of a letdown. I was particularly disappointed in the development (or regression) of the Starling character. Strong and boasting an impressive moral compass during previous exploits, she seems more like a robot in this book. Harris also seems to have gone to great lengths to soften the title character and I often had to remind myself that this guy is a serial killer who likes to eat his victims. One thing I did like was the juxtaposition of villains, as Hannibal can hardly be referred to as the biggest monster of the book. I guess it sets the stage for another sequel, but do we really want it? I don't know."
1,Don't Bother,"We would have been better off if Thomas Harris had never written this book. He has taken two exceptional characters and completely ruined them. I guess Harris just ran our of ideas for this one. If you liked ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of The Lambs"", do yourself a favor and don't read this book."
3,Not a bad Read...,"If you are a fan of THe Silence of the Lambs, This book is for you. There are a few slow spots and some unessisary rubbish thrown in there, but it is well worth it for the ending. You're either going to love it or hate it, and I loved it"
2,Worst ending for a book ever...,"Tom, you should have kept Lecter in jail. While he was incarcerated, he was far more creepy and threatening. Once he escapes, he becomes omnipotent, and thus, far less interesting. During the course of the book, we learn that Hannibal Lecter can: read people's minds, hypnotize animals, kill anyone at anytime anywhere in the most complex way with absolutley no forethought, outwit the entire world, flasify any document no matter how complex, speak 18 languages, whip up gourmet meals made of brains, and convince Agent Starling that she's his wife. The lead-in to the last few chapters was great, and is totally ruined by the ending which seems like it was written as an afterthought. If you liked Silence of the Lambs, this book will piss you off! There's a reason why Jody Foster refused to play Clarice in the movie adaptation of Hannibal! Trust me on this one..."
5,A Great Sequel To An Amazing Book,"hannibal is a fantastic film but some people don't know that silence of the lambs, man hunter , and hannibal are books. i think that the book versions are much better than the films..though it is fun to hear anthony hopkins voice when you read the hannibal lines. it's a great book that will keep you turning the pages till you are done."
2,should have stopped at the last hannal novel.,"i was not too satisfied with this one. i think they should have left well enough alone with the last novel,The Silence of the Lambs. one Hannibal is enough. a little boring and out landish in parts, especially the brain part."
2,Definitely a LetDown,In the top two worst books I've ever read; its as though the author's aim was to concoct the most abnormally psychotic events that would totally gross out the reader and add an unbelievable ending. The ending was not acceptable. The book was filled with abhorrent scenes leading to an irrational conclusion. Not recommended for reading entertainment.
3,Hannibal and Clarice doing the Grand Tour together ?? No!!,"I thought,'The Silence of The Lambs'was about as good as that sort of book gets.(6 out of 5 stars) The followup however,I found disappointing. I mean,Hannibal as a 'goody'??(well sort of)I don't think so. Hannibal and Clarice touring the Great Opera Houses of the world ??Nooooo..please Noooo. I mean where do we go from here?? This, surely,means the end of 'Hannibal the Cannibal'as one of the great,and certainly more entertaining,characters in the literature of our time. The book had a few 'thrilling'moments,but all up,I was very disappointed."
2,An author shouldn't fall in love with his characters.,"Uh oh! Maybe it hasn't been success, but something's spoiled Mr. Harris, who now wants us to understand Hannibal's inner child. Mushy as an antebellum romance and with Clarice Starling merely a cipher, this book is redeemed mainly by its early sections. Set in Florence, they are alive in a way which contrasts sharply with the cringingly predictible rest of the book. harris's new face expression: ""bleed out."" Whenever someone dies, he uses the phrase, resulting in the marriage of slopped editing with disappointing writing and a mystery more tantalizing than the novel's.."
2,Very disappointing sequel,"Thomas Harris seems more interested in giving geographical and historical lessons in his latest book than any real story developments. Having thoroughly enjoyed ""Silence Of The Lambs"", I was anxious to read ""Hannibal"" but came away feeling very disappointed."
3,Slow to start and an ending that still leaves me bewildered,"The story moves slowly but does keep the reader interrested. After all it isabout Hannibal or is it? It has extensive information regarding the characters from ""Silence of the Lambs"" and goes into depth Hannibal's background. Harris hinged on almost over informing the reader. I think as areader that we don't need to be lead down the path so to speak when it comesto seeing the story as a whole as intensly as he provided for us. It was at times tideous.But Harris was able to hold us through the book and I have to say that the ending was totally unexpected. Almost to the point that it was not a real ending but an illusion of a madman.I still have difficulty with the ending. No closure and a sequal may not be viable but Harris being Harris I would not be surprised to see one.I would be interrested to see how he would pull it off."
2,Ending Empty,"I can certainly understand the length of time Harris took to produce this sequel. Obviously the section on Italy took time to research correctly, and his integration of the inner-workings of the FBI and the Justice Department also required in-depth research as well. The question is, why the ending? I am a psychiatrist by training, and, after finishing the book, for the first time, I had to use my training to understand why an author would try to fit his characters into such a preposterous, unstatisfying conclusion. I still don't understand. This novel was a complete let-down. I would not recommend this work to anyone."
2,Im with Jodie on this one,"Although the setting of this book was much more appealing than either Silence or Red Dragon, it cant compete on all other counts. Even Rome and its museums cant save this book from mediocrity.The best thing about Harris' previous books were the absolutely loathsome villans, Dolarhyde and Lecter. Here I get the feeling that we are supposed to hope that Lecter will eventually prevail. A bit much to ask considering the man is a psychotic cannibal!! Mason Verger is the best character in the book and Gary Oldman played him perfectly in the film. In fact this entire book seems to have been written solely for the big screen. Man eating pigs may make great cinema but they are totally out of place here. And poor Barney, reduced to selling Lecter memorabilia! Im with Jodie on this one. One of the most anticipated books in years, its just plain disappointing."
2,No Silence of the Lambs,"I was so disappointed by this book, maybe because my expectations were too high, but it certainly is no comparison to Silence of the Lambs. This book was way over the top it was borderline disgusting. While I was reading the first few pages in this book, I was thinking to myself what kind of person could have wrote such a book. I found myself disliking every character in this book, and had great difficulties finishing the gruesome story. If you liked the first 2 books by Thomas Harris skip Hannibal, you will be disappointed."
1,Bold in attempt but shallow in delivery.,"While the plot of Hannibal proved both searing and intriguing, the writing was script-like in nature and, thus devoid of feeling. Climactic scenes and tense moments were left empty without the exploration of the human mind and heart. Though much of the writing was masterful, there was no depth or probing into the characters. Quite a disappointment. Buy this one only if you're mind thirsts for the answers to the questions left from SOTL. I can think of no other reason to spend the money."
2,Disturbing in its depiction of evil as something pure,Certainly the ending of this book was a great disappointment but not because the writing was poor or the ball was dropped with the plot. Those attributes are coincidental. The real disturbing element in this book was that evil triumphs over good. And I mean -- real evil. The descriptions of death and cannibalism border on the pornographic particularly when the main character is given elegance and grace to a level that approaches attractiveness. I wonder when the next serial killer will emulate what he or she learns from this book about eating people. Don't read this abomination on a full stomach and don't be taken in (as I was) by a fascination for the macabre. The plot is predictable and there is little mystery here.
1,Harris went one book too far with Hannibal,"Harris should have stopped at Silence of the Lambs. This book was a major disappointment to me. No real suspense, no real excitement. Disappointing ending. They will make a movie and at least the movie writers will be able to clean it up, show some good Florence scenes and make it a fun show. They sure will throw out a lot of the book and just use the name. One star is too much."
2,"not very good,disturbing","I can not believe the ending.The book was well written,but the ending was unbelievable.Would not recommend."
1,Utter trash...,"This book is utter trash, a huge disappointment, and borders on psycho-pornography. Harris must of had a screw loose when he penned this poor excuse for a book."
2,Not what I was hoping for...,"Thomas Harris lets his fans down with""Hannibal"". Where is the thrill of the hunt from ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs""? Particularly annoying is Krendler, Starling's enemy in the Department of Justice. He is a total caricature, a figure too simplistic to be believable. There is almost no reference to Will Graham, who I hoped would make a return, as he is the most interesting character in the series besides Lecter. The ending is totally ludicrous; All in all, I'd recommend rereading ""Dragon"" and ""Silence"", and leaving this one on the shelves."
2,Masterfully written....absurd ending.,"Thank goodness Thomas ended the story when he did.It had been years since I read TSOTL, and his writing style is so deliciously unique and HANNIBAL was so engaging that I fully enjoyed the first 90% of the novel. Needless to say, I, too, have a few bones to pick about the ending.Was he stumped? Was the deadline near? Editors breathing down his back? But there's no excuse for nearly ruining (yes, ruining) a good story with such a preposterous ending. To shame."
1,Puh-leeze,"No doubt Jodie Foster passed on the role when she got to the end of the book and it described Clarice's hairdo as a ""platinum helmut."" What drug was Harris on when he wrote the ending? No way can you change a belief and value system by dangling a few baubles and a plate of foie gras under their nose as Harris implies in the book. This one was a real yawn."
1,Hannibal Math,"Hannibal Lector's obsessiveness over food, wine, furnishings, flowers and Italian culture transformed the serial killer of the previous novels into someone sounding an awful lot like TV's Frasier Crane. I became weak with laughter as I imagined Hannibal speaking in Frasier's voice. I also determined that the character of Hannibal himself could be reduced to a simple equation:Dr. Frasier Crane + Martha Stewart = Dr. Hannibal Lector."
5,What A Stunner!,WOW.. what else can I say? IT was great! I read it in 3 days because I couldn't put it down... I HAD to know what happened to Dr. Lecter and Clarice . . . My favorite part of the whole book was the ending.. TOTALLY unexpected.. The book leaves you breathless but definately satifised . . . If you are thinking about buying this book... THINK NO MORE! It's a definate BUY!
1,[poor book],"...Starling and HL are so ludicrously different from their former incarnations they might as well be totally new characters, and the writing is so bad it's actually in bad ENGLISH, with the ""author"" often using non-sentences to set up ""scenes"" like a screenplay. You forgot the VERBS, Tom! How appropriate that Shlockmeister Stephen King gave ""Hannibal"" such a glorious write-up in the NY Times Book Review. Only somebody who can't figure out why Jodie Foster took a powder on the film sequel should read this book. Smart girl, that Jodie!"
4,I found this book hard to digest but am glad I read it.,I was somewhat disappointed in this book although I am glad I read it. I anxiously awaited it. I did not like what went on in the ending chapters. I know The Silence of the Lambs dealt with horrific occurences but this one surpassed my tolerence. It actually made me queasy although I definately will go see the movie. Go figure. I can't comment on any specifics as to not ruin the book for others.
2,Exciting right up to the final fizzle.,"I enjoyed Red Dragon & Silence of the Lambs, which stand as classics of the genre. This one starts off about how and where you'd expect, with Hannibal on the run and Clarisse in some career difficulty. The book reads well, with plot twists and character development in the B+ range. HOWEVER: BEWARE OF THE ENDING. Shockingly out of character, jarringly out of context, it could enrage you as it did yours truly. The last 20 or so pages made me ask myself: ""For *THIS* I spent money !?!!!?"" Caveat Emptor, folks, this one turns into a huge dog."
3,Absolutely hated the ending!!,"I loved Red Dragon (the best I think), loved Silence of the Lambs and was prepared to love Hannibal. It pains me greatly that I cannot say I did. I expected Clarice to be a much bigger part of the story and the ending is too surreal to even be believed."
1,HANNIBAL! is HORRIBAL!,"The only thing scary about this book is the fact that some people have given it more than one star. Not only was there no action or suspense, the characters were flat and unemotional. Who really felt bad about the demise of any of them? And the ending ... HUH? Harris builds some terrific characters in his earlier books only to wind them up like this? It makes no sense. Better luck next time (in the year 2010 probably)."
1,Complete waste of $$$$,"Like ""The Phantom Menace"", this book may be a victim of over-hype. On its merits, however, this book is still one of the worst disappointments I've ever had. The stage was set for a great sequel. Clarice Starling hunting Hannibal Lector, a monsterous villian. Maybe assisted by Will Graham or Jack Crawford. . . Nope. . didnt happen. . Instead we get a cast of characters that are more evil and sadistic than Lector, and what's worse is, they are unlikable and unsympathetic. The book is gross, and Harris seems determined to shock the reader with his prose. Not because it fit into the sotryline, but because he wanted a reaction from the reader. Additionally, if anyone has any other reaction than total disbelief at the ending, they should have their head examined.. like Paul Krendler."
2,A great disappointment!,"What a bummer!! I awaited this book for ten years. Red Dragon is by far Harris' best book but Silence was good too. That's why this book was such a disappointment. If Harris had become a hack, putting out a book a year, I could understand the loss of quality. But it took him ten years to write this. I found the characters and the plot unbelieveable. But the worst offense was the complete negation of Clarice Starling's character that had been so carefully crafted by Harris. The ending was about as realistic as Hannibal being awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine."
2,A sloppy effort by an otherwise great storyteller...,"I was disappointed with this book not because it didn't meet expectations, but because there was such a major fall-down in the style. Harris' past books have been characterized by both enormous restraint in graphic detail and consistency of character; this book had neither. At the end, he completely discards everything about Clarice Starling's character that he has carefully developed over two books just to pair her (absurdly) with Dr. Lecter. The graphic details in the book, while not approaching the level of say Stephen King, were disappointing because Harris had shown himself in the past so willing to leave these things up to the imagination of the reader. I had the feeling the whole time that the book was written to be transformed into a screenplay, and not as novel."
3,Tom Harris' joke on the public,"Here's a guy who's written four books in 25 years, made millions and now has the freedom to do whatever comes into his head. He takes some of his style from Dickens' Bleak House (not, alas, the contents); adds a dash of Stephen King (no wonder King loves this), and wanders on with whatever comes into his head.But ... It entertains. Harris is an entertainer, a smart one. He invented Hannibal Lecter, Johnathan Demme and Anthony Hopkins made Demme into one of the world's most marketable commodities villain and now Harris is free to indulge himself and write what he wants. Good for you, Tom, you've made yourself into an institution and the joke's on the buying public.By the way, the ending wasn't that bad. It fit with the rest of the book."
1,Don't bother making the move.,I was looking forward to meeting Clarice and Hannibal again. Nobody in this book seemed real. I believe Harris was merely writing for gruesome shock value. Don't bother making the movie. Even Anthony Hopkins couldn't save this script. A former Harris fan.
3,"sometimes fascinating, often intriguing, ultimately bizarre","bascially I like the book but the ending was so bizarre, I am still wondering what the point is. oh well, I guess if it was predictable, there would be a ton of people complaining about that...still, i never saw it coming. i'd recommend it...not overly gross. seems like a book that would come from a recluse, albiet intellectual."
1,Boring,What a disappointment. I loved Harris' earlier books and was very much looking forward to this one. I read half the book and couldn't make myself keep picking it up.Harris had two fascinating characters to work with and blew it.
2,This book is an insult!,I have never been so insulted! Harris must think his readers are idiots if he dares to end this book the way he did.
1,What the heck happened?,"This book was HORRIBLE! I can't believe I wasted my time reading it - a whole day...poof! Is this the same man who wrote Red Dragon? Nothing in this book was remotely scarey or spine tingling or even edgy. The villain was just gross and unbelievable, the hero - I guess Clarice and Hannibal share that dubious title? - well, what can I say about those two? She came across as not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed. And he. Oh my. I never thought I'd say Hannibal Lecter was dull and uninteresting, but he was. Boring is my verdict. I certainly hope Mr. Harris got paid bigtime for this one, because I believe he's just lost a bunch of fans."
2,Um - what the hell was THAT?,"It's actually kinda funny. If I'm anywhere NEAR the end of a book, I usually finish it - so it was odd to me that the book sat on my shelf, unfinished, for over two days with only around 30 pages to go, and I had no real desire to finish it.I SHOULD HAVE JUST LEFT IT ALONE!That a book with the potential that this one had - before even being written! - ended the way it did is beyond pathetic. I tend to feel guilty for not liking a book - I try to like everything. But not Hannibal. I'm just not sure what Mr. Harris was thinking. Some have said it was ""bravery"" and ""guts"" that he dsiplyed by ending this book the way he did. I'll call it laziness."
3,What was Harris thinking?,"After reading all three of Harris' novels containing Lecter I must say this was the most disappointing. In Silence of the Lambs he created a strong female role for Starling and completely ruined her in Hannibal. I agree with many of the other reviewers that it was an interesting book and the ending was a complete surprise, but I don't think that it was consistant with the characters Harris originally created. Both Hannibal and Starling lost something, and Crawford was another disappointment. I would only recommend this book to those who haven't read the two prior novels (Red Dragon and Silence...). It stands alone on its own merits just fine. For those expecting to revisit favorite characters, re-read one of Harris' previous two novels."
2,What a disappointment after the first two Lector books.,"There is no suspense, just insipid characters and vivid gory descriptions that somehow don't even arouse horror--they're simply too unbelievable. What a shame the character development didn't continue after such a brilliant start(s)."
2,"Cute romance, but not credible","I was very much expecting this novel to be a suspenseful thriller...but the more I read, the less credible it became. From Hannibal to Starling, the characters were so grotesquely unrealistic that I kept wondering how this got published.The ending left me incredulous...simply because it was so farfetched not even my vivid imagination could conjure how a serial killer would act like a male character in the worst romance novel.Let's label this one FANTASY. And HOPE it is NEVER made into a movie -- at least not the novel version."
3,Good to the last... but then the last was a real let down.,"I was engrossed in the first three quarters of the book. It was wellwritten as you would expect from Harris. However, the credibilitythat was carefully built around Hannibal and especially Starling was destroyed in the end. I wondered if he ran out of time and just turned something in to meet the minimal requirments of his publisher after putting the book down for the last time."
1,Thomas Harris gets the last laugh I suppose,"This book is, I truly hope, a joke. The pressure from Hollywood must have been tremendous for a sequel to The Silence of The Lambs. However, I'm insulted and quite peeved that Thomas Harris took his frustrutions out on his fans. We're the ones shelling out too much money for a book that was obviously written out of spite. Hollywood will still get their movie, albeit with a different (and most assuredly BETTER) ending. While I share Thomas Harris' feelings about ""sequels"", I wish that Hollywood would have been the target of his inside joke, and not the fans. Shame on you, Mr. Harris!"
1,"If Thomas Harris were here, I would kick him in the...","That's how much I hated this book. The majority of the book paled in comparison to Silence of the Lambs, but the ending was just absurd. It actually made me angry it was so bad. If I thought it would work, I would go to a hypnotist to get all recollection of this book removed from my head. In short, if you loved Silence of the Lambs, for god's sake DON'T READ THIS BOOK!"
1,Drivel,"I agree with the earlier reviewer that Hannibal is a tangled mess of pretentious garbage. If you want to read about psychological disorders on a global scale, read the great new novel, ""The Triumph and the Glory"". That fine novel won't insult your intelligence like Hannibal, it even has a REAL ending, one you won't soon forget."
1,"Incredibly disappointing, Mr. Harris how about a refund?","Couldn't have been more disappointed with a book if I purposely tried. Incredibly tedious, boring, and without direction. You would think that after waiting years Mr. Harris would have come up with a book worth reading."
2,Not what I expected,"Reading ""Hannibal"" I felt the same sensation I did watching the new Star Wars. Harris concentrates too much on details and forgets to tell an interesting story. We get a load of useless facts and trivia about Lecter and other peripheral characters. What we don't get is the engaging exchange between the Cannibal and Clarice that was present in the previous book. Director Demme claims he doesn't want to film ""Hannibal"" because it's too violent. I think it's just too thin."
3,????????,"Well, I have to say, when I first finsihed reading this book, I wasn't quite sure WHAT I thought. And actually, I'm still not sure. I think the story started out living up to its expectations, but then it lost my interest somewhere for a while. It didn't take long for it to pick back up again, and then I read straight through to the end. Well, the ending left me a little baffled. I certainly didn't see it coming. All I can say is that ""Hannibal"" left a strange taste in my mouth. It seems people either LOVED or HATED it. I think they are both strong words, way too strong to describe how I feel, but I will say this. . .I can't wait to see what they'll do with the movie!"
3,What A Let-Down!,"I sat down with GREAT anticipation to read this book and was pretty much enthralled until the end..I mean, come on! What kind of lame and obviously rushed ending was that? I was really disappointed with the ending. What started out as a must read turned out to be the same old run-of-the mill book"
2,Famished,"Whereas ""Silence of the Lambs"" gave me that comfortably, but not too, full feeling, Harris' latest leaves me hungry. Pass the Chianti!"
2,Give me a break!,"All I can say is this book was a bitter disappointment. The villian (no, not Lecter but Mason Verger) was straight out of a DC comic book, our heroin Clarice Starling (which the average American equates with Jody Foster, whether they want to or not) turns out to be a total flake. And, poor Jack Crawford is dismissed with quite the whimper. After about chapter 65, I actually grew weary with Hannibal Lecter and really didn't care what was on his mind anymore. When I put this book down, I sat for a minute wondering what was Harris thinking. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this book. I suggest you don't either."
1,Very sloppy ending...,"I admit the major portion of this book was engaging and extremely well written. I felt the last three or four chapters were thrown together and felt very cheated in the ending of this book. If you have not read it yet, my advice is to pick another book and save your memories of Hannibal and Clarice. I wish now I had not read it and I agree with the others who say if this is the way the screen-play ends, the movie should never be made and I will be very surprised if Sir Anthony Hopkins or Jodie Foster either one sign on."
1,Definitely a waste of time.,"What a serious letdown! This book read like a parody of Harris' earlier work. I expected the last page to read ""Gotcha - the joke's on you!"""
2,A Made For The Big Screen Novel.,"Like Michael Crichton, Harris has let the screen potential of his amazing (overall) chronicle overshadow where this story should have gone. And this, the third Lechter installment, suffers mightily. Like he's more worried about how the movie will turn out rather than does the story, very simply, work. In this case, Harris' asking for me to suspend my disbelief is just too great a request, and he simply does not deliver. With Lechter, the story doesn't need the inclusion of another monster (Mason Verger). It needs more cat and mouse between Starling and Lechter, more of the claustrophobia that makes silence (the book, hated the movie) what it was. Needs more ""Hannibal"" and less (a lot less) contrivance. And the ending...please.....trying to hard to make a movie, Mr.Harris. Write a novel instead."
3,Disappointing,"Terrible ending. Although I enjoyed Krendler's ultimate fate, Lecter and Starling's ending was unbelievable and a total disappointment. Starling would never! Also, throughout the book, I thought Harris showed too much of Dr. Lecter's human weakness (childhood trauma, etc.) --taking away from Hannibal the Cannibal's creepy mystique."
5,"powerful, wonderful, perfect! What a movie it will make.","Harris a genius, gutsy, bonechilling, gutwrenching writer...if you only read one book this year, read this, you won't be sorry. Loved the ending, never would have guessed the writer would do it. What nerve, what wonderment of mind, what a reward for followers of Clarice and Hannibal. Speaking of which, where is the sequal to Hannibal? Had to read and stop, read and stop, did not want the story to end. Harris, we salute you!"
2,The ending ruined it for me...,"This is not a book that did much for me. I loved Silence of the Lambs. It kept me on the edge of my seat. This book, however, just left me wondering what the author was thinking once I reached the end! I had high expectations, but they were quickly deflated. Although there were some aspects of the book that I liked, its conclusion really just cancelled those out for me."
2,"If I want a comic book story, I'll read a comic book","I read the entire book over the course of this afternoon. It was fun, and had one truly great moment in my opinion. But the rest seemed like the plot of a comic book. Not a well-written comic, but a cheesy Preacher rip-off. Harris created great characters like Clarice and Hannibal in the last book and ruined them in this one. It seemed like he was writing the book as if it was a movie, yet if they made a movie from this book, I don't think anyone would watch it, even if Hopkins, Foster, and Demme were involved."
4,liked it but i'm traumatized,"the actual writing was hard to digest but the plot was good and tasty to follow. i loved reading about clarice and her emerging personality especially since i didn't have to hear Jodie Foster's annoying accent. The ending was completely unexpected and i believe i'm still in denial. During the ending, I would read a page and start screaming,""No way! No way!"" I can't wait for the movie because i know they won't keep the ending. definitely worth the time to read at least once."
2,"Good beginning, horrible ending","I just finished reading Hannibal today, and I am very dissapointed. After reading and watching Silence of the Lambs, I expected that Hannibal would be a very enjoyable book. I was certainly wrong. First, the deaths of characters from the original books ruined the story in itself. It would have been a much better book if the ending had been different. If Harris write another sequel, it better start out with Clarice waking up, and saying the words ""Wow, It was all a dream"""
1,Over-hyped crap!,I really can't believe I was roped in by the hype. It seems as though Hollywood was calling the shots on this movie as opposed to an accomplished writer!The beginning was slow boring. You may give him the excuse that he is building charater and atmosphere but for how long!; The middle: Well he just keeps building - you start wondering whether the story will actually get anywhere. And the ending! My god! What a pathetic cop-out! Everyone lives happily ever after!I've never subected myself to the ordeal of reading anything as bad as this in my whole life. Don't buy this book unless you're interested in insulting your own intelligence!
2,Dissapointing... but an ok ride...,"As a huge fan of Harris, I ran to the nearest bookstore last Tuesday morning... I could have walked... and had breakfast along the way... 1. The plot feels forced, like Harris was writing off other people's suggestions. 2. Characters such as Barney, Clarice, and Dr. Lecter seem to have changed in personality in ways that don't fit their character... but have to, to fit the book. 3. The ending is silly. 4. Parts of the major plot are silly. 5. Too much detail in areas that don't matter and not enough in places that would have been interesting.As a book on it's own it's OK. As a book by Thomas Harris and a follow-up to Silence of the Lambs -- Dissapointing. Read Red Dragon.With all of that I still read it in a few hours."
2,Title should be HORRIBLE not Hannibal!,"A poorly written, (passages are actually repeated word for word) underimagined and subpar effort. Like much of modern cinema, this novel substitutes excess for inspiration. And, I'm sure this was written with 'screenplay' in mind. I was very, very disappointed. Save your bucks for the film, which , and I don't say this often, has to be better than the book. Instead read: Dan Simmons or Robert McCammon for an adventure, horror, fantasy ride that never dips."
3,Disappointing ending,"I agree with the readers who said that the first 400 of so pages were good. Yes, the descriptions of food and sights in Florence did tend to get a little tedious, but I felt it revealed something of Hannibal's character. However, the ending was very condescending and ""out-of-character."" I actually reread the last few chapters trying to figure out what I had ""missed""-- did Clarice perhaps have the same ""surgery"" as Krendler? What exactly happened between them? I did not like the ending, and almost felt rushed through the ending. What happened to the warrior that Hannibal respected so much?"
1,Man-Eating Pigs? Need I say more?,"Tsk, Tsk, Tsk! What a sad waste of an audience's attention; and a poor ending to interesting characters. The story line was so rediculous as to actually have succeeded in making me angry! Heaven forbid this should be made into a movie!"
1,Did Thomas Wolfe have a STROKE?,"Harris attempts Wolfe-esque description of Florence, Dante, and Renaissance art... and falls completely flat. And I wasn't aware that Hannibal was the evil version of superman: faster than a speeding bullet, able to kill massive quantities of highly-trained professionals in a single swoop. Nor was I aware that Hannibal was the genetic recombination of James Bond and Dante. THIS BOOK IS COMPLETELY REDICULOUS AND WORTHLESS. Pull $20 our of your wallet and burn it... at least that way you will get your money's worth."
1,"actually, ZERO stars","As a huge fan of The Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, I felt guilty for hating this sequal as much as I do. I was sadly relieved that I was not alone in my disappointment. I'll try not to repeat the other reviewers' complaints except to stress how utterly stupid the ending was. The rest of the book was okay, tolerable, but definitely not up to the author's previous work. I hope that when the movie is made, Hollywood had the good sense to change the insulting and ridiculous ending."
2,I felt utterly let down--,"I'm not sure Thomas Harris even wrote this book--the ending destroyed a so-so book.It was his characters I loved the best so I was appalled at what he did... Harris made Hannibal look misunderstood when he introduced Mason--not to mention his sibling.I can't believe he ended this book like this--it's a betrayal of the readers as well as Starling and Hannibal .I loved the interplay between them in ""silence""--now it's reduced to a soap opera.Thank God for Barney--at least he remained true to his heart.It wasn't worth a ten year wait and if they make it into a movie, my advice is to change the ending cause this dog will not hunt!"
4,enthralling,i thought it was just wonderful. lecter is up to his old tricks and even a few new curves were thrown in. a definate read for those who enjoy this type of book
4,review reconsidered,"I read the book again and read the reader reviews, and there seems to be great controversy about Clarisse's character. The ending is still disturbing and hard to take, but readers who think Clarisse is a cardboard cutout at the end should reread those chapters again. It throws Lecter's villainy into higher relief, shows Clarisse can still match wits with Lecter, and sets up some very interesting possiblities for a sequel, if there is one. I agree, though, that it will be tough to bring this to the screen."
3,Entertaining but disgusting,"I haven't read silence of the lambs so I have no basis for comparison. I was entertained by hannibal just I would be curious about looking at a car accident to see if I see anything interesting---but then if you do see something, you wish you didn't. Harris is an incredible writer but the story goes a little overboard. Some of the killings seem like Harris tried to come up with the most disgusting concepts and place it in the story. I am not easily grossed out. I am a doctor by profession an I generally can tolerate gross things but Hannibal had some hardcore parts. Otherwise, the book is interesting. I think the movie will be good. I would not recommend this book to people who are easily grossed out though!"
2,Horrible,"As a fan of Thomas Harris' previous books, I was excited to read his newest offering. I was very disappointed with this book, because it seemed like he was forced to write it. He introduces new characters in every chapter, but as a reader you never quite care for them. We know that they will eventually be Hannibal's victims. I was most disappointed with the ending and understand why Jodie Foster would not want to do the sequel. It is against her character and it seems that Harris didn't know how to end the book. It was a big disappointment."
5,"Elegant, stylish, powerful.","I must wonder what this book would seem like without having seen Silence of the lambs as a movie. The first chapter unfolds like a movie script, and images of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster fill the places of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling as the story progresses. So be it.I am not about to spoil your reading experience by revealing crucial plot details, but can (and will) say that this is a masterpiece of modern suspense writing. The gripping plot, the wonderfully elaborate characters, and the chance to look inside Hannibal Lecter's twisted genius mind are treats not to be missed."
2,Too Hollywood,"I was very disappointed with Harris' latest. I don't like what Harris did with Clarice's character. And when I didn't think it could get any worse, I got to the ending. I can see why Jodie Foster didn't want anything to do with the movie!! I felt like I was reading a screenplay, this novel was ""too Hollywood"" for me."
2,"slow moving, with nonsensical violence","I was very disappointed in this book. It drags on and on, with a hard-to-believe ending.Violence is used as a substitute for plot, and at times is so far out, that it's like watching professional wrestling.Save your money."
3,It wasn't nearly as good as Silence of the Lambs.,"I found it dragged in places. I thought most of the characters fascinating but sickening. I was a bit disappaointed in ""Barney"" and didn't like what happened to Clarice Starling at the end. I'd would like to see a prequel to all the books that deal with Hannibal that tells how he was origially caught."
2,Not as good as it should be,I found the bizarre violence to be an attempt by Harris to outdo his previous novels. He may have suceeded but it is not nearly as good as Red Dragon. The ending is disappointing and totally out of character for Clarice.
3,Not the best of the series,"Personally, I feel that this was the worst book of the Lector series. It is not that it is not well written. Like all of Harris' books, it is written in a simple but compelling style that keeps you going until the end. The problem is with the ending, which doesn't really make sense in the context of the book. I won't spoil it here, but what I will say is that I had heard the ending was ""controversial"". I expected it to be controversial just because of goriness or violence or whatever--now that I've read it, I think it was ""controversial"" because it just really didn't make sense in terms of character development. It seemed like Harris was just trying to get in a twist ending. Who knows. Interesting read though--you have to read it if you are into the Lector books, just know that it is not perfect."
4,"GOOD READ, BUT NOT A 5","Hannibal is a good read but not 5 star quality like RED DRAGON or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. This said, the book is worth your while to read.What's missing from this book is the broken glass terrorism of the earlier books. Clarice is now a 'Jack Ryan' clone, able to leap over tall buildings with a single bound. Hannibal is a poodle, not a wild wolf."
2,utterly disappointing,"I must say, considering the circumstances, this is the most utterly disappointing novel of the decade. Harris wrote one of the most interesting suspense novels ever with ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" which was turned into an equally compelling movie. He has worked on ""Hannibal"" for 11 years and this is what he has come up with? ""Hannibal"" starts off as an average book and ends up terrible. By the end, Harris ruins everything he has built up. Even Lecter, one of the most evil villains of our time, ends up degraded beyond repair, as he is given a history and morals. He is best suited as a minot character; his presence wears thin as he is in the spotlight. Need I mention how ludicrous the plot is? I pray that Harris brings his next novel out much faster and that he sticks to what he does best, creating a compelling serial killer and having Lecter help track him down. This will be a bestseller, but Harris may not be so fortunate next time."
3,Shocking.,Not as good as Silence of the Lambs or Red Dragon. Starts out slow but then gets exciting. More violent than the previous books. Surprise twisted ending.
1,Prediction: It'll never be a film without huge revisions,"Tom, Tom, Tom, you've been grotesque before, but there was always something stimulating about the resolution of your tales. Not this time. We liked and rooted for the tortured Jack Crawford in ""The Red Dragon,"" and we loved and cheered on the vulnerable Clarice Starling in ""Silence of the Lambs."" But there is nothing to like in this book. It's almost as if you decided to write something so throughly grotestque and depressing that Hollywood wouldn't dare touch your book. Hannibal Lecter was only interesting because he inspired the best from Jack and Clarice in their effort to outsmart him. Watching Lecter gobble up his adversaries is about as exciting as watching fishing - no matter how beautiful the setting and how exquisitely you describe the taste of the bait, it's still fishing. I am a huge fan of your other books, but this one fails so miserably, I was compelled to write."
2,This took 11 years?,"As a big fan of Harris, I bought this the first day it came out. It kept me interested, though it also kept me confused, with the jumping between continents. I was looking for the solidarity of writing that he gave us in ""Silence"". My first impression upon finishing was that he had secretly finished this a year after the movie to ""Silence"" came out and kept it, because it felt rushed. Clarice isn't really developed, Crawford is thrown away, etc..It seems like he tries to shock us on every page, and it doesn't work. For me, ""Silence"" worked because it was a quiet book. This book practically screams at you. The writing is different, a different style that seems to work here, though the narrator pops in and out and makes it rather annoying since we don't know who it is."
2,One of the silliest endings I've ever read,"With his three previous novels, Harris had impressed me with his intelligent and genuinely scary stories. This one, however, disappointed me greatly. I won't give away the ending, but I have to say it was completely unbelievable, disappointing, and--I thought--insulting to readers who have been following some of these characters since Red Dragon. Maybe, it wasn't possible to out do Silence of the Lambs and remain plausible. Then why bother? The book starts and develops well, but fans of intelligent plotting and character development will feel cheated by the time they finish the book. I was also put off by Harris's playing with second person passages, which were too cute for a thriller. I regret the money I spent on this one."
3,So much potential...,"For the most part, this is a very compelling and well-written book. Unfortunately, what could have been a classic is spoiled by an utterly unbelievable and disappointing ending. I came away from the climax feeling cheated and disgusted. What a miserable end to a great trilogy!"
3,Excellent book - Lousy ending,The entire book is good and keeps the reader on the edge. Some how towards the end the story looses its grip. I feel that another sequel is expected.
3,Never have I been so thoroughly disappointed !!,"I have waited for this book by what I thought was an amazingly thrilling but subtle writer for years. When I first read that there may be a sequel on the horizon, I would check with the various book stores on a continual basis as to its arrival. I almost did not order this book through Amazon.Com because I didn't think I could stand the wait for shipping. I have never been so utterly disappointed in my life!!! I have read all of Thomas Harris's prior literary efforts and I was always very impressed with the methods he would use to nail you to your seat, but never (even though the subject matter was inhumane at best) was it with child like discriptions of brutality. In a nut shell, I really think the author ""SOLD OUT"""
1,One-Hit Wonder,"Thomas Harris definately had a ""one hit wonder"" with Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal has no suspense, is completely lacking in characters, and is basically a really bad story. If this actually does hit the big screen it will only be good if it is an entirely different story. I am amazed I actually finished the book, it was a complete disappointment!"
3,"Good, but could have been better","Like many people, I bought this book the same day it was released and dove right in, thinking I could finish it in a couple of days. However it just did not maintain that kind of intensity. There was too much detail paid to Lector's likes/dislikes. The continuity of the story was difficult to follow at times. No one reading a thriller could be that interested in Italian history.On the plus side, it was horrifying in places, reminiscient of ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Red Dragon"". But it does not compare to Mr. Harris's two previous works. Perhaps another ""sequel"" is in the works to atone for the ending of ""Hannibal"". Let's hope it is not eight years away."
1,Sorry I read it.,"I read both ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" and very much enjoyed them. This book I thought about putting down half-way through and once I finished it, I wished I had. The writing isn't bad, it is the story line. I found nothing redeeming about it. It wasn't enjoyable, didn't end well, and just left me with a sick feeling in my stomach."
2,This book read like one big book of cool cop terms.,"After almost 10 years since his last book, I sure expected alot more. More to the point, If an author is going to write about ""cops"" or law enforcement he should have one proof read it to see if cops really talk like that. He also needed better research, nobody referes to ATF as BATF, U.S. Marshals do not wear uniforms and unless you are a member of the FBI HRT team you do not carry a colt ""cocked and locked"" 45. After about three chapters of these inaccuracies and all the cop jargon one can handle I had to put the book down."
3,This is an interesting follow-up to Silence of the Lambs,"While this book has been deemed a sequel by some, it isn't really- it features the same characters, but that's about it. It definitely was an interesting read, and Harris's prose is outstanding. There are wonderful descriptions of everything from Florence to a lobotomy. I was a bit disappointed with the ending of this book, I didn't feel it followed how the characters had been developed, but overall it is an excellent book and I would advise all Harris fans to read it."
2,"Stink, stank, stunk","I guess I'm still trying to figure out the ridiculous ending to the book. Maybe I just don't get how this would ever happen. The story line up till the end was somewhat believable and at points graphically gory and morose, but I think Harris has been reading too many long-winded Steven King novels. There are a couple of parts of the book that were intense and worth reading a couple times over, but too many pages in between them.Although, Harris' the ""Red Dragon"" is still one of the best and most horrifying books I've ever read."
2,Ruined the whole experience,"I gave this two stars because the first few hundred pages werean enjoyable read, although not nearly as well written or well plottedas SOTL. The ending was so disappointing that it effectively ruined the whole trilogy for me, and I will never be able to enjoy the first two books the same way again. I'm going to try as hard as I can to forget that this book ever existed. Some of the people who actually liked it told me to go back and rethink the book in light of the ending. What Harris does to Starling is even worse than what the FBI did. A profoundly sexist book (and I'm a man!) Also I like a good bottle of wine now and then and consider myself to be a cultured person and I found Harris's literary masturbation in Florence insufferable. I wish I could turn back time and unread this bloated waste of time."
2,"Huge disappointment following ""Silence of the Lambs""","I clearly remember being ""spooked"" reading Silence of the Lambs back in 91 and looked forward to Harris'sequel with anticipation. What a let down! The first three quarters of the plot is well-paced and sets up the potential for a good finale. The final outcome, however, left me fuming with disbelief."
1,Harris sells out...,"Let's face it...this novel is abominable. Lackluster plotting, half-baked characters, pathetic pacing, sophomoric narrative--this is a BAD novel. Harris' other novels were far better than this tripe. I only dread the upcoming hack-and-slash Hollywood film. Avoid this garbage; reread Harris' Red Dragon instead."
2,The sad destruction of two great Characters,"What a dissapointment. After reading Harris's brilliant sirst two works, I expected a work at least on par with Red Dragon. While the first half of the book is a worthy attempt at plot, in the second half we witness the total destruction of both characters. While not spoiling the ending, it will surely leave fans of the series screaming ""WHAT?"""
5,Great Book...don't particularly like ending,"Great book! The ending is a tad bit too unlikable, reminescent of Entrapment. I cannot wait to see the movie, since they change the ending. Don't read if you are faint at heart, but if you're interested in the FBI, canibalism, and/or memory palaces, this is your book!"
2,Disappointing,"I suppose I should have expected the sick images; I knew who the book was about. But what I didn't expect was the ridiculous departure in character by Clarice. Chalking it up to being drugged and hypnotized was weak. Her end was totally out of character and unbelievable. The only reason I didn't give the book only one star is that it fully kept my attention throughout. The suspense was good. But as I finished it, I almost regretted wasting my time."
3,Not as good as Silence of the Lambs,"This book takes a little more time to get into than Silence of the Lambs. It is still enjoyable, just give it time. The ending will certainly surprise you as it did me. Thomas Harris is an excellent author, read his others."
3,Thomas Harris forgot that Hannibal Lecter was a serial Kille,"He was seven years old to give continuity for a work that was a show, but he got lost completely, and gave a sad end for Hannibal Lecter and Clarisse Starling. ""the Bone Colector"" of Jeffery Deaver is very better following this same style."
2,Beauty and the Beast?,"Promising beginning. Harris fleshes out Lecter's character (no pun intended) and gives the reader details about the thorns in Lecter's paws. As the book moves along, Harris slowly diminishes Starling and turns this formerly by-the-rules FBI agent into a renegade who gives up everything for her monster. Near the end of the book, Harris switches genres and begins to write fantasy..and poor fantasy at that because there appear to be no rules. The ending of this book is incredibly disappointing. One can find absolutely no basis for it anywhere in the tale of the relationship between Lecter and Starling. Lecter and Starling are totally unrecognizable characters as the book winds down. Harris has the talent and imagination to have written an ending worthy of his readers and of his two main characters...sadly, he chose to turn the strong and intelligent Starling into a simpering fool and to end a fairly interesting novel with a cheap trick."
3,Hoping the movie sequel has a better ending!,The book receives a 3 based on three stages: 1. The first third is well set-up. 2. The second third had me turning pages at a furious pace. 3. The final third was spine-tingling until a very surprising and complete letdown of an ending.The end is unbelievable and quite disappointing. I guess I feel I know Clarice Starling better than the author.
1,No value here -,"This is a sick stupid souless piece of garbage. When I finished it I threw it in the garbage can. God help the fools who find anything redeeming in this evil, meaningless, trash."
2,Mr. Harris should be ashamed of himself,"This is not a sequel to ""Silence,"" it is a crude joke. He's taken Starling and regressed her instead of building on her character. She speaks in Catskill twang through most of the book. Lecter is now one of these bad guys who only kills really bad people, or people trying to steal his wallet. Or people trying to catch him. Whatever happened to devouring census takers? He's not truly bad, now, in fact, the reader gets a cuddly personal history of Lecter which explains why he became so bad, darnit! It wasn't his fault! Some bad guys did bad things, and made Lecter bad! Mommy! I'm bad now! A misfire on every conceivable level, staring with the first chapter. So disappointing...so sad. Lecter is almost superhuman, does this guy work out or what? The ending will leave your mouth agape. Agape at the horror of what Harris could have been possibly thinking when he scribbled this missive on paper. Abominable."
2,The ending is the only good part!!!!,I think Harris was trying to go against everybodys expectations w/ the ending and hey I was really bored until the last 3 chapters. I don't know how the heck they are going to make a movie of this!!!
3,Definitely Not As Good As Its Predecessors,"Although most of this book was good, I could not believe how gruesome this book was. While I am not squeemish by any means, I was riveted and sickened at the same time. I could not help but think that the author must have felt he had to ""top"" his last two bestsellers in the sadism department. I cannot imagine how Hollywood will be able to make a film anywhere true to the book and not get an NC-17 rating. Still, much of the book was excellent. The ending simply didn't gel with the image of Lecter and Starling that the author originally developed and created. Was he trying to be controversial?? Ya got me! price!"
2,He's gone overboard with descriptive horror.,"In his previous novels, it was just horrific enough to keep you turning the pages to see what could possibly happen next, but this book just goes over the edge. You don't have the chance to use your imagination because it's all written out for you. After waiting so long for this book, I am sorry to say that I am disappointed, and a bit sick to my stomach. Mr. Harris gives out ""too much"" information this time."
1,I should have just re-read is other books.,"Hannibal was probably the most awaited book sequel that I couldn't miss. However, it was also my biggest disapointment...re-read ""Silence"" for the thrill and skip this one altogether...."
2,Could have done without Italy,Very disappointed. The Red Dragon was 100% better. The parts in Italy were just much to long and detailed. Hope the movie is more moving.
2,Disappointing Ending!!!,"I thought the book was very good until the last 50 pages. If the book would have ended with a climax at the Muskrat Farm, I would have been very satisfied. As it is, i was very disappointed in the ending...very dull."
4,Deliciously Written right down to the end!,"I am very pleased with Harris' Hannibal. As the book is based on the desires of a human cannibal, Harris managed to take the most believable route. It can be taken for the obvious that a book about a cannibal is going to be bloody and gory, i don't understand why eveyone is so surprised. For once though, I do think the movie may be more satisfying than the book. So many times while i was reading i pictured this on the big screen and i got the chills. iIt was hard to get the full effect of the last chapter without seeing the phsical setting Harris had pictured. Overall i am impressed with both the plot and outcome of this book. Each time i read it i couldn't wait to come back for seconds!!"
1,Very dissappointing,"Mr Harris, Jonathan Demme is right. Do yourself a favor and let him make the necessary changes if you want the film of this dissappointing book to be successful."
3,The Gruesome Gourmet Returns,"Newsweek magazine said that Jonathan Demme is not interested in doing the film version of ""Hannibal"". I read the review before the book and thought, ""Come on, how nasty can it be?"" Could it be that bad that Demme would think it's too violent. Short answer: Yes. Carnivorous and quite hungry pigs and creative dinner time surgery are just some of the fun awaiting you. If you've got a strong stomach and can believe a rather preposterous relationship succeeds, GO FOR IT. Otherwise, pick again."
4,Outstanding sequel to Silence.......,This book is an excellent sequel to Silence of the Lambs. The location in Europe is the perfect place to enhance Dr Lector's senses of the supernatural. Quite a surprise ending.
2,Controversial !!,"Why write a thousand word essay when a few simple words will suffice ? This book is self-indulgent drooling hardly worthy of a writer of Robert Harris' stature. Do yourself a BIG favor and avoid Hannibal. Read something just as riveting but not as stupid, like one of the fine new Stephen King books, or that towering Second World War novel, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY. Or if you absolutely insist upon reading Harris, read SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, not this sewage called Hannibal."
1,"Boring, Slow and Predictable","Unfortunately, Mr. Harris has elected to demystify Hannibal Lecter by completely changing his behavior and offering a childhood trauma to explain his psyche. It's quite disappointing and removes the fantastical horror of his previous books. However, it seems to be the fashionable thing to do because Starling also completely changes character, enabling a most predictable and entirely uncompelling ending. Other characters are poorly developed and make obviously foolish decisions which only serve the purpose of positioning them to be dispatched in a gory fashion. Darwinism, I suppose, but it makes for a tedious and uninteresting read."
1,A nasty joke - and it's on us,"Unfortunately, those before me have pretty much summed up all that is wrong with this thing, from cardboard characters, to rambling plot lines, to some seriously questionable editing. But enough about this book; now we have to fret about the film! What amazes me is that 'Hollywood' has already paid millions for the film rights, but I understand Mr. Demme has already passed on this impossible directing job. Let's just hope the actors who gave us such a sublime thriller in 'Silence' will take flight from whatever one could possibly conjure in trying to transfer this to celluloid. And by the way: have you noticed how most of the critics have bought this Emperor's 'new clothes'?"
2,I didn't get what I expected!,"I'm truly dissapointed with the change in Clarice Starling. It is not believable, and it leaves me unsatisfied, as thought the last hundred pages were written under pressure of a deadline, or the author just got tired of the subject."
4,"Very good, but not quite up to the first two","I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but I do have one criticism. The most chilling aspect of the first two novels is that they both felt entirely possible. In ""Hannibal,"" Harris stretches the bounds of plausibility more than a few times. This allowed me to distance myself a bit from the story which lessened the impact. Don't take that as a knock at the ending with which so many other reviewers seem to be troubled. The ending is completely unpredictable and yet, in Harris' own dark world-view, also completely logical. It will be interesting to see what Hollywood does with this material. I doubt the major studios would have the stomach for a faithful adaptation."
2,Harris cannot be happy with this....book.,"I work for a major studio and reading this book was like reading one of the many BAD scripts we receive daily! It seemed Harris was writing a movie script instead of a novel. He made some things very sick and unnecessary. What did he do, make a bet with someone (for a dollar) that he could write the sickest and most unrealistic screenplay ever? If this were to become a movie, it should be direct-to-video with all ""B"" actors. I disliked the way Harris overemphasized references to Silence. To Mr. Harris, disappoint your fans, disappoint yourself."
2,"Shame on you, Thomas Harris","You took a complex and courageous female protagonist and reduced her to the kind of vacuous heroine normally found in supermarket romance novels. This was still a great read, and I appreciate the attempt to explore the dynamics of the intimacy between Lecter and Starling, but the outcome was very disappointing. Maybe you were shooting for ""Heart of Darkness"" but this ending is more like depraved Danielle Steele.I, too, have been a fan of yours for over 20 years, and pre-ordered this book. I will not make the same mistake on your next one."
3,Not sure what to think,"Interesting to read the reviews because it gives me a new take on the book. Initially, I was excited and thought the beginning was funny and a bit gross - just what I wanted. Then the boring Italy component, chase scenes, etc were tedious. The ending was stupid. Then I read the other reader reviews and think, ""well, maybe they have something."" I'll have to ponder it.You might be disappointed with this book if you're looking for a neat, clean horror story, but open your mind (so to speak) and see what bigger themes might be there. Interesting."
3,To Many Grand Expectations... Still a Good read...,"After waiting so long for the sequel, I must have built up to many expectations for Mr. Harris to ease... While being a great fan of his and of Hannibal, I was a bit disappointed by the sudden twist of Clarice; how could she? I still enjoyed the book thourghly from cover to cover but felt it was missing something. The psycological dwellings into the minds of Hannibal ans Starling were to few and far between. I would still recommend it to anyone intrested because the research and detail are impeccable and make it is as beleivable as possible. What I did not like were refrences to contemperary companies. It made it feel like paid advertising, after all haven't we heard enough of Starbucks and Nike already. I am still a great fan and do reccommend this book to all, it's just not as good as Red Dragon and Silence.Juan"
3,Bad endings make for bad books ....,"As a devoted fan of the Hannibal Lecter series, I was ecstatic that the closing to the trilogy had finally arrived! My ecstasy soon changed to dismay however ..... the beginning scenes with Clarice were neither gripping nor compelling .... the middle scenes were well crafted however - Mason Verger is truly a fiend capable of unimaginable feats. But the ending of this saga was terrible and completely out of character and unbelievable to say the least. The result leaves the reader wondering why on earth he/she pre-ordered this book in the first place .... I would have waited another year for a much better ending to a terrific series .... this was very disappointing. Shame on you Thomas Harris - you know the rules: bad endings simply make bad books !!"
4,a completely different approach,"Like millions of others, I have been waiting for this novel for years. Nothing from my own imagination could have prepared me for what Mr. Harris delivered to the world. Yes, I thought it would neat for Will Graham, the man who caught Lector in the first place, to come out of retirement and collaborate with Starling to catch Dr. Lector. But that would be just a little too easy. I'm glad that Harris took the approach he did for this novel. That's why I read...that's why we all read for that matter. If you already know how the story goes, why read it at all. By taking a fresh approach, Harris has taken his characters to a new and unanticipated level. Excellent work, in my opinion, from one of my favorite authors. I can't wait to see how Dino pulls this one off on the screen."
3,it's hard to one-up a masterpiece,"SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was truly a masterful work of fiction. Its sequel, Hannibal, was inevitably in the shadow of the masterpiece. Harris' task was huge. Did he succeed? Doubtful, perhaps. But if he writes another, providing an on-going tale, he just might."
1,If I could rate it in the negatives I would!,"I have read a lot of books in my time and I can say without hesitation that Hannibal likely ranks as one of the worst ever. Non-existant editing and totally ridiculous from start to finish. This is the only book in memory that I actually wanted to either throw out or burn! If you have not read anything by Thomas Harris forget this one and read Red Dragon or SOL. If you have read these but not Hannibal, trust me, avoid this book at all costs."
4,"The Author teases, as Hannibal does","I very much enjoyed the book, but I did think that it went on and on and on to get to the jucier parts. At any rate, it's worth reading."
3,It made to third base - but it's no homerun!,"Although I beleive that Hannibal remains an intriguing and facinating character, the book seemed to crumble and come apart towards the end. The climax was obviously written with the silver screen in mind. Most of the book is convinsing and beleivable until you get towards the end. At this point you will begin to spiral into an unbeleivable and weird world that does not flow well with the rest of the book."
1,"wait for the movie. better- don't bother with that, either.","just me, or was this written like a screenplay, with scenes blocked out and camera directions. i guess Harris saw as a forgone conclusion that this latest book would be turned into a movie. what a sellout..."
1,"If you like the genre of Stephen King, read Stephen King","...Gone are the beautiful metaphors that littered his previous works... In the whole book of 'Hannibal' I found only one phrase that was worth noting...I will think very seriously before I read anything of his again...If I'd wanted to be grossed out by banal horror I'd have read a Stephen King. He has made that genre his own and has a particular genius for it. 'Hannible' was a pale, shadowy copy and nothing more. There were some great ideas there waiting to be developed but he chose to...go for the cheap thrill."
1,"Bummer of a book, Hal.","This book had me as its captive audience on a trans-Atlantic plane flight. It is a downer from start to finish - nothing of the quality of the other Hannibal books. I wish I could have fallen asleep, or had the forethought to have a back-up to read."
1,Humbug!,"Thomas Harris wrote THIS? Oh God... this is a blatant romance and melodrama, served as a splatterpunk dish with a glass of gore. It does not approach the mastery of Red Dragon. It is not even as good as Silence of the Lambs - it is simply a bad novel. Eleven years of waiting for THIS?????"
1,The Worst Book ever Written by A former great Author,"Thomas Harris sighted the ball, dropped it, and punted. This book is so poorly constructed it read like it was written in a week. Unlike his other books, Hannibal is totaly predicatible, totally overblown, and without any redeeming value whatsoever. This may be the low point of American publishing. Where was the editor? Where was the author. Thomas Harris had no desire to write, and this book shows how deep that antipathy went. He ought to have spent his time reviewing Italian hi-end consumer products for magazines."
2,Talk about dropping the ball.....,I am sure by the time you see this review you vill be very aware that something is terrible amiss with Mr. Harris. The pressure to produce must have been enormous. This was the most unsatisfactory ending I can remember ever reading. Poor Agent Starling!!!!
2,I'ts No Red Dragon!,"I'm confused, was I reading the latest installment in the Hannibal Lector trilogy or a script from the Food Network. Even a devout foodie like me grew weary with the endless references to food, wine and Lector's ""distinctive copperplate hand"" There is a reason that editor's have jobs! What's more what has happened to our dear Dr. Lector; once the embodyment of evil he now seems like just another misunderstood dandy. Needless to say I was disappointed, this novel pales in comparison to Silence of the Lambs and Red Dragon which I consider the finest of the three. Better luck with number four Mr. Harris."
2,"won't keep you up at night, that's for sure","Finished this book last night, and it was a real disappointment. If only one hadn't had to wait 11 years for the follow up to Silence. If Harris would have been pumping out a book every two years, one could forgive him this yawn-fest. Implausable and suspenseless. Sure, some exquisite gastro-intestinal touches. But I was hoping I'd be really doing some stomach-lurching and squirming reading this novel - as it was it was a real let down.As for Stephen King's review in the NYT Book Review (whose reviews are usually very kind to begin with): don't believe the hype. King's review is way too kind and he should know better."
2,Horrible,"Absolutely horrible. I enjoyed Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, but this is just Harris bringing the whole series to an end by killing off his characters. He didn't even do it well.A major disappointment."
1,a massive disappointment,"Thomas Harris may perhaps be forgiven for falling in love with Hannibal Lecter, the character who made him a multi-millionaire. But the rest of us have no such excuse. Feeding someone his own brains is merely disgusting; it does not constitute true horror fiction. Harris falls into the trap of allowing his readers too much access to the mind of Hannibal Lecter, a narratological strategy that inevitably brings understanding and elicits a certain amount of sympathy for the ""good"" doctor. But such understanding and sympathy are totally misplaced here. Red Dragon remains harris' masterpiece."
1,Horrible disappointment,"I waited with bated breath for this book to show up. I was ready to have my nerves tingle as with _The Silence of the Lambs_. And it did, for the first 3/4 of the book. And the last part of the book ruined the whole durn thing. I can't even go back and read _Silence..._ again because of it.I applaud Jodie Foster for her integrity in not repeating her role as Clarice because of what Harris did with her in this novel. I'm sorry I paid the cover price for it, it was such a disappointment. Shame on you, Mr. Harris."
1,"Grimmest, most depressing ending I have ever read","I will not upset the one or two people who haven't read this book but still want to by giving it away. Suffice that I understand entirely why the film ending is different, that I threw it out after finishing it and advised friends and acquaintances not to read it, and think Mr Harris needs help if he thinks this was an appropriate ending for a lead like Clarice Starling. If we want to see evil win we have only to look out the window; in fiction I prefer to have some hope left to me."
4,Hannibal at his cruelest,"I found Hannibal not as sophisticated as The Silence of the Lambs. Lectar plays a very prominent role in this book. However, I found the some parts rather gruesome and unnecessary. Lectar was portrayed as an evil man even though he seemed to have found some comfort in Starling. Nevertheless, it was an interesting read."
3,"Sometimes very good, but nauseatingly pretentious.","More than being the projected future of Hannibal Lecter post-SOTL, this third entry in the trilogy may say more about how the author has applied the profits from his first two novels. European travel and fine wines. I found the Italian travelogue overlong, murky, and tiresome, and was nauseated by the endless descriptions of Hannibal's impeccable, pretentious tastes in literature, language, wine, art, etc., etc. Many of the characters were well-conceived, and the ending, plot and action sequences were fine, but I agree with those who say this novel was written with a film in mind. I won't go see it."
2,disappointing,"After reading the glowing King review in the Times, I was expecting a harrowing and wonderful ride. Instead I was bored. Most of the characters were 2 dimensional caricatures -- cartoon villains. Lecter and Starling had a bit more depth, but the story around them was so weak that I felt sorry they were trapped in it."
2,"A good read, but not worth the wait.","Although Hannibal is an interesting book, it seems Harris made a conscious effort to put forth a book that will be next to impossible to make into a movie. Harris should have used an editor on this one as his ramblings about Lecter's shopping are just too monotonous. Starling grows from the assertive, strong female lead to a weak doll, easily manipulated by Lecter. Women should be furious that Harris has turned her into a sap! I dare someone to make this movie."
5,Harris once again delivers a breathtaking thriller.,"Harris, THE true master of psychological suspense, once again delivers the impossible--a breathtaking page-turner filled with descriptions so intricate that one truly sees the locations and feels each emotion the author intends to elicit. As a longtime suspense reader often bored with trite, predictable endings, I was truly blown away. Even avid Harris readers will be haunted by the finale of this impeccably researched tome. Five stars does not begin to do this work credit."
1,"This was a spoof on silence of the lambs, right?","I wouldn't give away this book. Literally. I wouldn't want the receiver of my gift to think I would condone such a horrible display of literary talent. Gang members? Inplausible media reactions? Man hungry farm animals? Is this guy kidding? The same plot, different parchment. It was obvious that Harris rushed to get ""Hannibal"" published. I think maybe he should have stopped on ""Silence of the Lambs"" instead of trying to write a trilogy. Some moments of the book were dull and exhaustive. I skimmed atleast 2 entire chapters in the book and did not miss a single arm movement in the plot. Harris made it all to obvious that he was trying to ""shock"" the reader. Without sounding completely cruel and mean, I will end on this note. I want my money back!"
1,I've never been so disappointed...,"As I read the book I was constantly plagued by the weak writing and unbelievable events that happened in the story. There were many occasions that I had to read and re-read sentences or whole paragraphs to decypher the words, there were several times when I was unsuccessful.It was only by sheer force of will that I was able to finish the book. Once I had swallowed my disbelief and realized how Harris was going to end this waste of time I had to force myself to keep reading. I now look back at those 15 minutes as 15 minutes that I will never get back. When I consider the other ways I could have spent that time I am saddened. I could have used that time to clean a cats litter box and encounter better literature.If you feel you truly MUST read about Hannibal make sure it's the one with the elephants and not the unbelievable wet literary noodle in this collection of words. (I can't bring myself to call it a novel.)"
2,Not well done,"Overall, this book was rather disappointing. The story has a very disjointed kind of feel to it. I suspect that the author wrote the middle section first and then tried to build the story around it. While the structure is lacking, the actual writing is pretty good. I agree with the other reviewer who said: ""good storyteller; bad story."" I was also disappointed by the lame attempt to try and soften Hannibal's psychopathy by providing a ""reason""--childhood trauma, of course. I thought this weakened the character instead of giving him depth (as, I suspect, was the intention). Despite these flaws, the writing was good enough to keep me reading. The ending, however, was utterly stupid. I won't spoil it but you'll see what I mean if you get there.I say ""if"" because I wouldn't recommend this book.Not recommended."
1,Please recycle,"Throwing a book away, literally putting it in the trash along with the cat food cans and rotten tomatoes, is taboo. If a small but imperious voice in my head had not kept repeating ""you don't throw books away"", that is where my copy of Hannibal would be. Buried in some gigantic rubbish heap, or at the most, shredded for pulp. It may still get there - selling it back to my favourite used book store would be contributing to the spread of garbage in the world. Most thrillers have some redeeming value in their versions of the modern-day fight between Good and Evil. Not this one. Rich faceless sadistic paralysed child-abusing animal-abusing ex-torturer pursues Hannibal the cannibal, aided and abetted by various sickos armed with experienced man-eating pigs. People end up gutted and brains get eaten. This is the kind of read that makes you feel dirty. I'm not proud of having finished it."
1,what was harris smoking?,Harris did not write this book. If he did he had better hang it up. this was one of the worst I have ever read. the only reason I gave it one star is because you would not except a Zero.
1,Not worth reading.,"Harris should have quit with Silence Of The Lambs. Hannibal is very poorly done, the writing of substandard quality, the characters just not credible. Starling comes off as an incompetent nitwit, Lecter is not credible in any sense of the word, the plodding quality of the book is unbearable. The ending is just juvenile, in fact, the whole book seems like one that would cater to a juvenile audience. After reading 100 pages I skipped to the last chapter to end the agony, but it didn't."
3,"Stars for elegance, penalties for repugnance.","Thomas Harris is such an exquisite writer. Reading his work is like sampling fine wine at the ritziest place in town with the most elegant partner available: you know you're with someone who has a lot of class and style, but is restrained enough not to flaunt it.Anyone who can make this story seem elegant is a master. The plot is not so good, the descent of Lecter and Starling is frankly disturbing, and the fact that Lecter is not the most ghoulish character in the story is a cause for concern on the behalf of the author at times. Harris has outdone himself this time -- I don't consider myself extremely squeamish but I grimaced in disgust many times during this novel. While I enjoyed the prose for its lucid brilliance, the story left me queasy when finished. Read at your own risk."
3,5 stars without the absolutely bizarre ending,"Harris can write, no doubt. The story meanders through the lives of an officially disgraced Starling and an escaped Lecter.Lecter's seemingly unended stream of funding and alternative identities keep him clear of the authorities. At the same time, FBI officials hatch a plan to disgrace Starling. And Lecter's only surviving victim coincidentally has a vast fortune at his disposal to attempt the capture of Hannibal.Lecter's feelings for Starling propel him to aid and assist her. All of the components inevitably end up in a vague, disappointing mish-mash of an ending.Tactically, Harris executes descriptions as well as anyone but Wolfe. Strategically, however, _Hannibal_ leaves a lot to be desired."
3,Not a bad read,"I'm fortunate in that I haven't read the other two books in this series, so I'll be judging this book on it's merits alone. As far as I can tell the author precedes storytelling for constant fashion and artistic name-dropping. I can't imagine that happened in the other books. Also, I found it a little odd that in the end Hannibal turns in to some sort of demi-god. I suppose it's possible that a man of his intellect could fluently speak several languages, master the piano, have an impeccable sense of fashion, work as a successful surgeon and psychiatrist, have a thorough understanding of medieval italian literature, AND be a gourmet cook...wait, no, you really COULDN'T do all that. That aside, the fact that the main character--Starling--seems to go through this weird and abrupt change in book's conclusion made this book a little difficult for me to truly enjoy."
2,What a shame!,I saw the movie and I read the book. I preferred the movie's ending because it kept the integrity of Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling intact. I appreciated that. Something was lost in 'Hannibal'. Nothing seemed to hold together. It was too surreal; too vague.
1,Hannibal,"I am an avid crime/mystery reader and thought that since I enjoyed the movie Silence of the Lambs that I would enjoy this new book. This book could barely hold my attention! It read like a movie script - I am sure that the author thought he could save some time in doing both a novel and a screen play at the same time! What a disappointment - I now have no desire to see the movie as the book failed to ""capture"" me. Such a dissappointment!"
3,A bit of a disappointment,"After more than a decade's wait, and after surviving the inevitable hype surrounding it, HANNIBAL, the sequel to the excellent SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, proves to be somewhat of a let down. Although it's undeniably well written and a page turner as well, HANNIBAL is flat, and unsatisfying. After SILENCE, the motivations behind the actions of Special Agent Starling and Dr. Lecter don't seem to be true to the previous book and left me scratching my head. While I'm not saying don't read this book, don't go into it believing all the hype either."
3,A let down,"I had enjoyed Hannibal Lecter in Red Dragon and especially in ""The Silence of the Lambs"". I found the new book enjoyable, up to a point, but the conclusion was a complete let down for me (I won't go into details so as not to spoil the suspense for you). The new villains are scary enough, but the new Hannibal Lecter, though ore fully developed seems to be too different from the Hannibal we met in ""The Silence of the Lambs""."
2,Gruesome,"I like a gory book for the sake of scariness; however, this book was just silly and gross. I was so disappointed. My advice - skip this, and read Red Dragon if you haven't already."
1,The true horror came in the time I wasted reading it,"This book starts off strong, like a fine bottle of Dr Lecter's best Chianti. As I closed the first chapter, I felt for sure I was in for a breath-taking ride. But as the pages peeled by, and I descended further into the mind of Hannibal and Starling - and their morally bankrupt support characters - the book became a progressively bigger disappointment. The last 50 pages left me annoyed that such great characters as Hannibal and Starling could be dealt with so ludicrously by their creator. My advice? Read the first chapter over and over again, and feed the rest to the pigs."
2,It took 10 years to come up with THIS?,"After finishing the book, I thought about throwing it against the wall I was so mad. The ending seems thrown together at the last minute, which, considering the fact Harris took 10 years between books, is ridiculous. The action was not as violent as I had expected it to be, but is still pretty graphic. The details of Italian history were both entertaining and educational. Overall, not a horrible read but likely a disappointment to Harris fans."
2,Minimally interesting but flawed,"Without a doubt, the action scenes in Florence were the best parts of the book. The BIGGEST FLAW in the plot was that the author never gave a reason why Clarice and the FBI KNEW that Hannibal Lecter was coming to the U.S. after he had to leave Florence! After all, he could have gone to Brazil, Asia, Europe other, etc. There was never a reason given for him to come to the U.S."
3,"The book began with a thrill and ended with a ""plop""","I found the novel gripping until the last 150 pages. I have never been so let down or disappointed by an ending before-it was really strange and did not fit with the theme of the book. I didn't even realize the book had finished until I read the next page ""acknowlegments"". Wow, what a let down Thomas Harris-you're not worth all the hype!!"
1,Give this one a pass,"It's a shame that a man as obviously talented as Thomas Harris would waste his time writing a piece of filth like this. This is a corner of the soul that no one needs to view. His characters and dialogue are well drawn, but his subject matter is depraved, to say the least. There is nothing redeeming about this book. And there is certainly nothing entertaining. Don't waste your money. I threw my copy in the trash after about 60 pages. I doubt that any intelligent person would want to pollute their mind with this book."
2,"Good, Except for the Ending","I enjoyed Hannibal, until the ending, which I found preposterous. The ending is nonsense, and ruined a great book. I described to a friend, who found it so ludicrous he immediately accused me of making it up. If you're a Hannibal Lecter completist, wait for the paperback, so you'll spend less money to be disappointed."
3,"An intersting read, but...","I found ""Hannibal"" a bit of a disappointment. While it kept my attention, I found it lacked in something. ""Silence of the Lambs"" was rivotting, while this book grabs you from a more morbid perspective. I really found myself not liking anyone in this book, even Clarice. The ending, which I will not give away, was disturbing. I found myself angry at it and at the direction Thomas Hariis chose to take the characters. On the whole, I'm almost sorry I read it. But not quite. Like I said, it did appeal to hte morbid imagination."
2,Disappointing,"I'm surprised towards the generally favorable reaction ""Hannibal"" has received here. I enjoyed ""Silence of the Lambs,"" but have found numerous problems with the (money-inspired) sequel.The unending violence which Harris throws at the reader quickly becomes numbing. Dr. Lecter could take America out to dinner, but leave the reader a disinterested specator.Also, his prose approaches the atrocious. For instance, on pg. 144: ""The expo opened to enormous, unexpected crowds; excitement leaped like a trout in the public trousers."" Shirley Jackson would be turning in her grave after writing like this.Michael"
3,Anyone else having issue with the CD ?,"I'd just bought the CD this past weekend and have been listening to it in the car to and from work... at the close of disk 1 Clarise has put herself in a potentially dangerous situation, a little suspenseful so I quickly pop out disk 1, put in disk 2 with some eager anticipation... only to find myself in the middle of the story of Turin Turumbar, BOOK 2 of the Silmarilion (I happen to also own the CD of the Silmarilion set also, so that's how I know... also a GREAT book by the way, highly recommended...). I guess this doesn't really qualify as a review but I was VERY surprised to see that of all of the reviews currently posted, none made reference to the audio CD's. I also wanted to put something out there to see whether others had experienced the same issue."
2,epic fail,coming into this book i had high hopes. i previously read both red dragon and the silence of the lambs and enjoyed both. this book had a poor plot as though the author was just trying to make money rather than tell an interestimg story. the summary of this book makes it sound better than it is dont believe you will be intrigued if you think the summary sounds interesting. a good third of the book takes place in italy. this is where the author put all his heart and it was the crappiest part of the book. the only thing that kept me reading was a belief that the climax would leave me satisfied with the rest. the ending sucks dont waste your time or money. this book doesnt deserve to be associated with the silence of the lambs
1,Even fans should be disgusted by his laziness,"The only thing I'm disappointed with is that I couldn't give this book a negative rating; this has got to be the WORST book I've ever read. Skip any superficial observation about the material - Harris was plainly writing a treatment for a screenplay, and fell prey to narcolepsy after the introduction. The reader should be so lucky - gone are little bonuses like internal dialog, character development or believable plot, and left in place is the most juvenile, amateurish parody of Harris' own writing.Read Red Dragon again, and steal a copy of the movie when it comes out on video cassette - don't waste any money encouraging this type of Hollywood-fueled minimal effort."
1,Unbelievable!,"I still find it hard to believe this was written by the sameauthor as purportedly it was. The characters have not evolved... aucontraire, they are cardboard and boring. Hannibal Lecter gets a pastthat justifies his brilliant evil mind and automatically negates everything that he [T. Harris] painstakingly set up on ""Silence..."" and ""Red Dragon"".Never had I witnessed such a painful and degrading change in a loved Character as Clarice M Starling.An unbelievable disappointment."
3,Out There,"While I found the book to be very entertaining overall, I was not satisfied with the ending. It was a bit far fetched for Starling to end up as Lector's companion. The planned torture of Lector was a little lacking in imagination as well. I just didn't find that the book measured up to the complexity of Lector's charactor."
1,Terribly disappointed!,I really was disappointed with this book. I found it lesssuspenseful and just more shocking than Silence of the Lambs. And theending was absolutely ludicrous. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
1,About as bad as it gets!,I hadn't read a piece of fiction in several years. Because most novels are so weak. When I read that the third installment of the Hannibal Lecter trilogy was coming out this summer I got really excited. Since I had enjoyed both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs in my fiction reading days. After reading Hannibal I'm going back to fiction. I don't have time to waste on this c**p!
4,"If you can get past the Italy chapters, the book is great..","I agree with most of the other comments. The first half is a little slow trying to get through all of the Italian history and language. It took forever to read these parts. But, the second half was great. I flew through the book. The suspense was great and I could picture everything in my mide so vividly. Only the ending was truly awful. Read it, you'll see."
1,Where's Bruce Willis?,"This book is a big disappointment. The Silence of the Lambs was not great art, but it was a good beach read. Hannibal is neither. The plot has predictable action-movie sequences, and the prose reads like a script treatment for a film. Honestly, I'm surprised Harris just didn't admit that he wrote this for the big Hollywood bucks, and stick in ""camera pans left,"" ""fade in to cheesy overhead shot of Rome, with tourists,"" etc. That would have been a lot more honest of him. Skip the book and wait for the Bruce Willis blockbuster. Also, I just read in the paper that this book is going be made into a film starring Jodie Foster and Sarah Michelle Gellar. So there you go. Save your money."
3,"Fascinating, but ultimately diasppointing.","Like many of you, I bought it the first week it was out, rushed home with it, and like Dr. Lecter might do with a new acquaintance, I devoured it. Maybe I ate too fast, maybe I need to go back and eat it again, or maybe I just need to let it go. Did anyone but me think the Italian cop was worth saving just because of his decadence? Did anyone but me think the ending was over wrought and, well, contrived? Did Harris get tired of writing, or thinking? Good book? Hell yes. Anything more? No. Wonderful characters and characterization, MTV plot."
1,"Harris, DO NOT ever read your own books, PLEASE!","Big Disappointment. Unless a Mississippi native trains extensively with a phoneticist in acting class, he has no business reading this kind of writing. Sure, your Italian is passable, nothing out of the common way; but how can you disappoint us after the brilliance of Kathy Bates's reading Silence? You are a great writer, but not a good reader. All of the suspense is lost on your provincial, run-of-the-mill, southern accent. You should have asked John Lithgow, or Ed Bagley, Jr, or Ms. Bates again."
2,"slow, unlike Harris writing, not a Silence.","First half was very slow, wordy, strange words that were not explained. Not connected. Unrealistic. Not a silence of the lambs, not even close."
1,Thomas Harris let us down...,"After reading his previous books, I can say that I'm very disappointed. The shocking and gruesome parts of the book are not enough to keep the reader interested. After a while it gets boring and tiresome. The funky ending really sucks!!!. I'm glad that I took this book from my local library instead of wasting my money on this aberration. It is to be hoped that his next book will return faith to his followers."
4,Very cute!,"This scarf is nice quality with a cute Hufflepuff iron-on crest. Four stars instead of five because it's a bit scratchy, but otherwise, it's quite nice."
5,For Your Hufflepuff Pride,"I received this scarf for Christmas and could NOT be any happier. This scarf is comfortable, though perhaps a tad scratchy if you're not accustomed to wearing scarves. The colors are fantastic, and I love the crest patch that's on it. The scarf is very long; as far as I can tell it's the same length that you see in the films. I've taken to wearing mine the way that fellow 'puff Cedric Diggory does in 'Goblet of Fire'; the length is much more manageable that way.Like other reviewers mentioned, there may be an odd scent; I think it was just from the plastic that it is packaged in. It's been just two days and I've had it hanging in the open and the smell already seems to have left. Really, if you're a Hufflepuff, or you know someone who is, this is an amazing and cute gift to show off the house pride. I can't recommend it highly enough :)"
4,"Great, but smelly.","Scarf looks and feels great. The only thing is that there is a strange scent to it that I cannot get out. I've washed it, but the scent still remains. Quite strange. But overall.... Go Hufflepuff!!!"
2,"It's cute, but smell's","The scarf picture looks good and it seems like a great buy!However, upon opening the package the yellow is a darker shade than in the picture and then I notice a dusty smell to the scarf, So I'm trying to air it and out thought about washing it, but the scarf says, ""Dry clean only"" so Now I have to pay for dry cleaning for I can wear it because dust and Myself don't mix. It would have been nice if the scarf was in storage that the scarf was washed before hand.Other wise it's nice and I do enjoy it."
5,very well made scarf,this was a gift for my daughter and she loves it!! this scarf is very well made and soft to the touch. i would recommend this scarf to family and friends!
3,most of the songs were so-so,"The songs ""The way I Are"" and ""Apologize"" are the best songs on the cd and the rest were kinda boring, I thought."
1,Same old garbage,"What's the difference between one r&b/hip hop cd or artist from the next?? just a name that's all, all of it is the same and it's boring crap. You've heard 10 seconds of a song and it's just looped over with god awful lyrics just for morons to blast to make them feel cool, pitiful listen to rock and metal those people actually have some talent"
1,Buyer Beware,"If you are expecting the same level of quality shown on Nelly Furtado's album, Justin Timberlake's album, or Madonna's album, it will fall short of such expectations. It has the same feel to it as the others sound wise but digging deeper, lyrically it is horrible, he comes across as a thug, that no one on earth can mix a track other than him, there's confidence and then there's arrogance, the n***** and the f*** word are overused if not abused, last but not least he comes off as a chauvinist who thinks he's gods gift to women."
3,It's not too bad,"I do like the album overall. I mostly flip back and forth between the same 4 or 5 songs, but overall, it was good in my opinion. I kind of think of it as DJ Khaled's ""Listennnn"" meets Diddy's ""Press Play"" because the CD relies a lot on featured artists and sometimes there are songs that the artist isn't even on (""Fantasy""). I think Keri Hilson was a nice touch to the album. I wish she'd get a CD relaesed already.Umm... did anyone else think ""Release"" sounded like a rehashed SexyBack beat?"
4,International music,"This is truly amazing coming from a mainstay U.S. producer...just when u thought pop sucked, hip hop was dead and R & B was monotonous re-enter Mr. Timbo, this guy has done what most producers are afraid to do amid record label pressure... F.Y.I. ...welcome to the world those of you U.S. music fans whose minds have been strategically molded by Mr.Record Company...""trained"" to love what they put out..anyway...this album is great, if you have an open mind and in love with BEATS..GO GET IT NOW!!!"
2,Not impressed,These cd didn't impress me as much as I thought that it would. There's only two songs on it that I think are good.
4,shock value a great surprise,"to all u haters of this album--- sit down.This album is a great contribution to many versatile styles of timbaland.I have been a huge fan of his since him and missy started.Any good artist knows that if u want a great or half descent album, see timbaland. His beats are always hot!! And this album, at first listen, u might not like it,but try to listen again, and you will see where his head is.This album makes u wanna be in da club movin summtin,for real.Trust, this is his best album yet.The other ones where not that bad.This album u can tell he put a lot of work into it.And i give him mad kudos for it. So if u like dancing, get this album, because u will move!"
2,just ok,"Timbaland has bounced back and in a big way over the past year. so he put out this Album which while showcases his tendencys towards beats and grooves, it also shows off the fact he has never really written a memorable song. he is more known for Grooves and beats. this album also shows that he is better suited behind the scenes for other acts as to doing his own thing because his limitations as a artist in his own right are there for the hearing. a few interesting things here and there,but nothing memorable. Timbaland does have some good ideas,but he doesn't get the most out of his own self as he seems to get out of other artists he works with."
2,Its not bad but its lacking....a lot,"Im wondering if Timbaland just went into the vault and pulled stuff out that he never used and never bothered to better himself. Its an OK album but thats it. The insulting part about the album is the heavy gloating on track one which is followed by MOSTLY tracks that are less than what you would expect after being gone a while....There is absolutely nothing groundbreaking on this album..which is sad and strange. the phrase "" one trick pony "" comes to mind with this album. Like other reviewers you will think its the same song over and over again....If your a Timbaland fan this one will leave you with an empty feeling....I just hope its a lot better next time around."
3,Shocking,"I really like only about 5 songs on this album. A few are way to vulger to even listen to. Timbaland is soo talented, I wish he could keep it cleaner."
1,Missing two songs,"Other people have touched on the artistic merits of this album, so I want to touch on the censorship.If you buy this from amazon in the UK it has 19 songs on it. This version sold in America only has 17."
3,Timbaland,I only like two tracks on this CD...but if you are into some techno beats this is whas'sup...DEUCES...
4,Very strong album!,"This is the best of Timbaland's three albums. Everything all clicks, especially The Way I Are and songs with Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent,Dr. Dre, Justin Timberlake, Nelly Furtado and others. Timbaland's always challenging himself with funky numbers here. Even his own label's artists have cool flows and rap styles. The one song he did with Elton John is remarkable. He went all over the map with artists on this album and it all fits."
5,Timbaland at his best.,"I've been upset by my recent purchases of my favorite artists, but Timbaland definitely delivers. Being a long time fan, I give it up to him for throwing in a diverse set of fresh beats and lyrics. From the original rappers like Dr.Dre to the legendary pianist Elton John, Timbaland doesn't cease to spark every bit of musical genre in ""Shock Value"". Well worth 10 bucks."
3,Not so shocking,"I was glad when Timbaland made a semi-comeback producing majority of Justin Timberlake's FutureSex/LoveSounds album.I love Timbaland, but this seems to not be as great as I thought it would. The only songs I listen to is:Oh Timbaland, Give It To Me, Scream,Release, and Miscommunication."
4,Solid CD,"I was at first alittle iffy about this CD but after a few listens it really grew on me. The beats are of course, very good. Some songs fall flat but their is such variety her, everyone can find somthing that they can enjoy."
3,I was surprised I liked some of the songs!,"Last year I thought Timbaland was one of the most overrated producers in the game. I liked some of the singles from ""Shock Value"" so I decided to get it at the used cd store. Wow was I in for a surprised! Some of the tracks are actually listenable! Timbaland actually experimented with new sounds on this album and it's not just the same cookie cutter beats that we're used to hearing from him. There are even rock songs on here featuring bands like The Hives and Fall Out Boy. I think ""The Way I Are"" despite its bad grammar, is one of the best singles of 2007. Keri Hilson's voice may be a little average, but the song is down-right addictive. I have to say my favrorite song is the 2007 single ""Scream"" featuring Keri Hilson and Nicole Scherzinger (of the Pussycat Dolls fame). While this album isn't perfect it is still very listenabls so I give it 3 and a half stars. If only they worked with U2 or Green Day on this album. Oh well it's still good!"
4,Love This,"I really likes this CD. i bought it for The song Apologize by One Republic, but I ended up really liking the entire CD. Its a good CD to listen to on the way to work, or wherever. It gets u pumped, and makes u happy, also almost all the songs are great."
4,I loved this album,"I loved this album. My only problem is I'm still trying to figure out who Timbaland is. There are so many appearances from other artiest on this album that frankly I might be disappointed if he did one solo. The US release has one song, ""Oh Timbaland"" that is only him (with Nina Simon in backups with a nice audio edit from the sound of it).Timbaland seems to be more of a musical choreographer than a performing artiest. He has some great artist in these songs but frankly I'm left wondering if these songs are really him or the people he has ""featured""? I do like the album though."
2,Expected more...,"Now, for the past year I've heard nothing but excellence from Timbaland...With Nelly Furtado's and Justin Timberlake's album it was just all so fresh and new. I still listen to his stuff with Alliyah and love it...The point is, I can listen to those albums over and over and every time I hear them on the radio, I turn them up...with this album...the only song like that is ""give it to me"" I'm not saying I didn't like any other songs...I did...like his collaberations with Elton John and She wants Revenge are pretty GREAT...I suppose I was expecting something different which led me to be let down. I love timbaland's beats though...always will...;)"
4,Great CD,"Half the CD is awesome the other half is ok. Worth buying for sure. It has Give it to me with Nelly and Justin which is a crowd pleaser. Plus it has Bounce with Dr. Dre, Missy and Justin which is a hard song. Then Timbo does something different on Come and Get Me with 50 Cent and Tony (back hand a 14 year old) YAYO. Plus Bombay with a savage Indain beat. To end it has ELTON JOHN playing the piano. Those 5 tracks make it worth buying alone."
1,No shock in this Value,"This cd is a straight joke, Tim makes good beats when the beats are for someone else, but as for himself, forget it. This cd was trash right when i put it in the CD player, People who like this kind of wierdness should go to the doctor and get checked. I have never heard such horrible music in all my life, this was so bad and crappy. whats this a mix between house and hip hop, ....?? trash this cd and all th esongs on it are trash Tim should think about NOT making anymore cds just stick to the beats. JUST PLAIN HORRIBLE !!"
1,Shocked,"I am shocked. I would have at least thought that the beats on Shock Value were going to be good (to make up for the fact that Timbaland can't rap to save his life). Even Timbaland talks about how much money he makes for beats in his ""hit track"" with Nelly Furtado and JT. It's too bad that he sold all his hot beats to other artists and didn't keep any for himself. One thing that he isn't is better than Scott Storch. Keep dreaming Timbaland. You are nothing more than a wanna-be Lil' John looping your 'yeah's and 'oooooh's in every track that sounds the same as the one before."
4,the same old stuff,the game is almost the same as the other one but with a teist its a girl the are some differant stuff but not to much same town its can be funer than the first one i liked it so ill give it a 4 but needs new towns people
4,a good game but falls short,i remember many a late night playing harvest moon games yeah i remember all the great ones the original n64 game and back to nature the game boy games but lately the games have been getting boring like save the homeland it didint have a marridge and the last wonderful life was good but lacked things this game has good things its intresting that ur charecter eventaully dies but id prefer playing as a boy also this has all the same charecters as the last one and the villedge is small they should have put the option in that u could pick to be a boy or girl it would have been easy to put an option like that in i hope that they will make a game that combines all the strong points of the searies but until then this game has many good featyres that will keep u entertained (but they should have had the option to be a boy!)
4,"If you're a Zombies fan, you gotta have this!","This CD is for Zombies fans who have all of the other Zombies' CDs. If you don't have the other CDs, buy the 4 CD box set, one of the greatest hits CDs, or their masterpiece, Odyssey and Oracle first."
4,There's Never Enough Zombies-Related Material Around,"""Into The Afterlife"" provides a further glimpse into the transitional period between the Zombies aborted ""R.I.P."" album and Argent, as well as Colin Blunstone's ""pre-solo"" career. Although some of the tracks are demos, a recording of a Rod Argent belch can be a breath of fresh air these days. The tracks that represent Colin's ""Neil MacArthur"" persona are interesting, particularly his reading of ""She's Not There"". Overall, I wouldn't say that the contents of the CD are all that mindblowing, but the Zombies alumni have always been capable of transcendent moments in pop music. This product is recommended for fans of the Zombies, Argent and Colin Blunstone, if only to complete your collection. It is also a worthy purchase for fans of so-called ""chamber pop""."
3,"Good, but keep some perspective","It's not the Zombies but rather the demos and singles documenting their confused aftermath, pre-Argent and at the very start of Colin Blunstone's solo career. Clearly assembled by an ardent fan and intended for the same, but some great songs nonetheless, in a decent package. I agree that the ""orchestral mix"" pieces are redundant, but I assume that there's not much else to fill this out. And it's worth it to own Unhappy Girl, the Procol Harum-esque I Could Spend the Day (written by Billy Vera!), and It Never Fails to Please Me, Rod Argent's variation on 19th Nervous Breakdown. But Liar, Hold Your Head Up, and God Gave Rock & Roll to You were just around the corner. . . ."
2,Didn't work for me.,"I had read rave reviews of this product on other sites. It was also recommended by my hair stylist, who really knows his products. Unfortunately it just didn't work for me. I was ready to stop highlighting my hair and trying to blend in all the old blond streaks while my natural brown grew back in ... if you've got fine, porous hair, be prepared for the possibility that this stuff just won't ""stick,"" especially if any bleaching or chemical processes have weakened your hair. It was worth trying ... definitely a good alternative to expensive salon processes."
5,Hauntingly beautiful...,"Scottish Moors has been my favorite cd for years. In college I would fall asleep listening to it every night. The music is haunting and beautiful. Some songs have sounds of nature intermingled with the music. This summer I had the opportunity to travel to Scotland for the first time, and I listened to this music over and over (even more than usual) in preparation. The beauty of the music is only matched by the beauty of the land itself. I cannot recommend this highly enough!"
5,"The darkness of ""John of Damascus"" is on to me...","When I heard the first thirty seconds of Sergei Taneyev's John of Damascus, I was hooked. It is such a dark and melodic piece from a man who certainly needs to be more well-known than Tchaikovsky. The overall power and emotion of this ""Russian Requiem"" is quite powerful and magnificient, and the third (final) movement is both exciting and tragic at the same time.I agree with those who believe that ""John of Damascus"" is more than just a filler (Yes, The Bells by Rachmaninov is certainly fabulous here). Pletnev knows how to deal with a dark cantata like this; the orchestra and choir give all their might in just twenty-two minutes.All in all, both Rachmaninov and Taneyev have equal importance here. But buy this CD especially for Damascus."
5,My advanced fifth grade readers love it!,"My advanced readers are eating this book up! It complements all language arts instruction because it has very creative word play throughout. This is a title for my book club and the ensuing discussion is always lively and contentious, because there is to much to interpret. A teacher's dream."
5,This Book is full of ADVENTURE,"The Phantom Tollbooth is a great book. It's full of adventure. Every chapter has it's own adventure. I recamend this book for people who like fantasy and adventure because Milo ( the main Character.) goes of to a world of wonder. When you read this book you'll meet strange, lovely, weird, and different kind of people, as Milo and his friends Tock ( the dog that goes tick.) and more. This is just a wonderful book."
5,Timeless and Toll-less,"I first picked up a copy of Milo's adventures in the 2nd grade when I was visiting a bookstore near Stanford University. I read it when I was 7 and enjoyed the magical story. I read it when I was 14 and was amazed by the nuances of the story I was too young to understand before. I read it when I turned 21, savoring the points of life truths and clever turns. I'm still reading it, although I lost the first two pages a decade ago. The Phantom Tollbooth is a classic that grows with the reader. I own two copies, you should own at least one."
4,Taking you into a new world,"This book is FABULOUS!If you want to read something that will take you into a new and simple world, this is for you! At any age, the magic in this book is enchanting."
5,The Phantom Tollbooth was creative,"I think the story The Phantom Tollbooth was very creative. For example, people don't sell letters or words and it is impossible to play music that you can't hear. There aren't little people called Lethagarians either. I like how the book gives me new ideas. Another thing I liked about the book was that the author explained everything perfectly. I felt like it was real. When Milo, Tock and the Humbug meet Rhyme and Reason at the end, everyone became friends. It was a good ending. I hope I find another book as good as this one."
5,"""Excellent!""","This book captures your imagination, and makes you think of the most creative things! The incredible use of education ""lessons"" , as in spelling, and math! This is a great book for children, and adults. Read this book, and I gurantee you will enjoy it, and will never want to put the book down!"
4,Book Review,"Phantom TollboothThe Phantom Tollbooth is a great book. If are going to read this book don't stop at the beginning because it might be slow but after the 1st or 2nd chapter it gets better. In this book Milo meets a lot meets a lot of people, and goes to a lot of places. If you ask me it's the best book I have read. Il liked it because it was exiting and it teaches you a lot of lessons. If you read this book don't see the movie first, read the book first. The movie leaves out of good things and things are in different order. Milo is the main character and along his journey to lands beyond his new friends Tock and Humbug accompany him. It's a great book and I hope you read it."
5,I wish I could give this book more stars,"I read this book as a child and never forgot it. It has given me the great love for words I have today. Very few books have the power to influence us for a lifetime, and this one did it for me."
5,This is a wonderful story!,"This is a great book ! I love all the little twists of words and the interesting names for people and places. I think that the characters are fun and likeable and I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. One of my favorite parts was when Milo, Tock, and the Humbug attended the feast in Dictionopolis. I also enjoyed the part when they rescue Rhyme and Reason from the Castle in the Air. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story and a super plot!!"
5,This is a great book!,"I am reading this book for my 6th time. It is very interesting and is very funny. My favorite part is probably (though I'm not really sure, it's so good) the ever-present word snatcher. I think he's really funny, though he is trying to be a demon."
5,Totally Funny! Very Clever!,"I read this book with my mom and we both loved it! This book has an interesting beginning, a strange middle and a suspenseful ending. The author put in lots of creative puns and amusing ways to use words. For example, Milo (the boy) thinks he going to meet a witch in the dungeon, but actually he meets a ""Which"" who chooses which words to say and which words not to say. I liked how numbers were gems and words were food. Personally, I believe that words are more valuable than numbers. I think the author just plain rocks!Ben (age 9)"
5,This book is fantastic.,The Phantom Tollbooth is about a boy who has nothing to do and a package is sent to him from an unknown person. It is a tollbooth! The boy drives through the tollbooth into a magical adventure. He meets lots of unusual characters on this adventure. This book is really funny.
5,This IS the best book I've ever read.,"I really can't put all of my feelings in a review with a maximum of 1,000 words. For this book, I would need all the space in the world, Because You really have to be mature to truly understand the message that they are trying to send in this book. Now I like to read books like ""Beowulf"" and ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" but I would choose this book over any other book on the shelf. Because not only the meaning, but the comedy isn't just slapstick, it's mature. If you havn't read this book, I hope that this review will have encouraged you to. Thank you."
2,The phantom tollboth,I think that it was very adventures and the end was very sadfuly oh Milo feel better I'm there for you
3,phantom tollbooth is pretty good!,"The first time I read this book was for school. This didn't make me think very highly of it. However, after I finished chapter 1, I knew this was a good book. I have read better books, but this one reaches my top ten list. It has good use of messing up the meaning of words. It was also quite funny in places. I liked it when Milo went to the marketplace because he could eat letters and words. All in all, this was a good book. Not perfect, but good."
3,this book was ok,"I didn't think this was such a good book. It was kind of good because some things you know will never happen and even though the author may have had a big imagination, I think it was too big. It wasn't too bad because some things were funny like when Milo saved his but in his mout or when Milo shot his but out of the cannon. Here's a short summary:Milo thinks life is pointless and has nothing to do with it, until a turnpike toll booth is in his room. He doesn't know where it came from. When he starts playing with is he goes into a magical world. In the world he meets all different creatures. Two creatures went with him to find Rhyme and Reason, two princesses who were in the castle in the air.Jenna, age 10, Santa Rosa"
2,Unbelievably tedious,"I can see where this book could be a good classroom tool, because it teaches the reader a lot about words. But I found it unbelievably tedious and we finally stopped reading it. I was reading it to my son, who is only 8, but very bright. Neither of us could stand it.My older son, who is 11, seemed to like it better, but he's very pedantic, which seems to the kind of person this book is geared toward."
2,Phantom Tollbooth,"The book is great. However, it took over three weeks to receive my order. I needed this as a classroom read, and I had to purchase another copy from a local bookstore because this one did not arrive in time."
3,"A good read, but not really finished.","It's hard to review this book. On one hand it is dripping with puns and figures of speech all of which require a level of general knowledge far in advance of the age group that would enjoy the rather childish story.As an adult I found the story too busy and poorly connected for example what use has Milo of a box of words when he appears completely able to use all the words he came with. And why does the Soundkeeper suddenly decide she likes the Dreadful Dynn when there has been animosity for years between them.This is a book that will need parts explained to young readers. However after this initial unpacking of meaning this story will be enjoyed over and over again by readers aged 7 - 12.I give it 3 stars because I believe it needs some more polishing and final reworking, it is however an imaginative chapter book very suitable for bedtime reading."
1,Library Edition is poor quality,"I bought the library binding edition assuming that it would be a durable copy compared to paperback and hardcover. Unfortunately the opposite is true; it is a paperback bound in a hard cover, and the way it is bound cuts off parts of the pages near the spine of the book. In most cases that's not an issue but since there is a full two-page map included, it is partially cut off. Also the paper is very cheap, low density paperback stuff. I haven't read the actual book yet but if I (and my kids) like it I'll probably have to buy a better edition."
5,life altering,"This book should be a must read, for children and adults alike. it is truly a beautiful book of friendship, imagination, and just plain fun. It was my first ""favorite book"" and I think I have read it over a dozen times. At 20 years old, I still treasure this book and accredit it with inspiring me to have fun, take responsibilty, be imaginative, and fill my own space. The style of this author influenced me to incorporate inginuity, creativity, and an element of childhood innocence into my own writing. it is not often that i book comes a long touches every aspect of your life as this one does. give it a chance...what do you have to lose. i think you will find that this amazing companion will be with you for the rest of your life."
5,This book is just about perfect,"For many years, this book was my ""rainy day"" book; whenever it rained and I had nothing else to do, I read this book and loved it. For the intelligent child of any age, this book can't be beat--it is similar in tone to, and ranks with, Alice in Wonderland"
4,Terrific,"This is a timeless work and I'm glad to see it reintroduced. In a world where everything seems to move so quickly, Jester gives us an imaginative, yet simple, story about the human desire to know more."
5,"Leslie Knope agrees, this book is great!","i admit, I never heard of this book before Parks and Recreation brought me here! But now I plan on reading this to my kids!"
5,I love this book!,"I can't tell you how many times I've read this book. I have a tattered and torn copy of it, and I just had to have the 50th aniiversary edition. In the days of Kindle it's fun to have a new ""real"" book."
5,review,5 starsbest book evercool and easy readgreat descriptionsfunadventerouscool charactersvery interesting placessurprisinggoodxway to pass time while having fun
5,A real treasure!,"Like many other reviewers, I first read this fantastic book as a child, and have re-read it hundreds of times since. It occupies an honored space on my bookself even now. How rare it is to find a book which is so funny, intelligent, and thought-provoking! Who among us (who have now settled into fairly routine office jobs) would not be thrilled to find Milo's tollbooth waiting for us when we arrived at home tonight!?"
5,"One of our favorite children's books: very ""punny""","The characters in this wonderful book are great! It is as enjoyable for adults as it is for children. We find ourselves constantly quoting lines from it. It is currently my children, ages 9 an 13, favorite book."
5,An Awesome Book...,"This book was one of the best I ever read. After all then funny puns, characters, and situations this book nearly changed my life. It told me to enjoy my life and be unlike Milo in the start of the book. I myself would like a trip to ""The Lands Beyond"" courtesy of The Phantom Tollbooth. If you read any fanasty book this is it!"
3,Cute read,"Reading it for the first time as an adult, I wish I had read it when I was younger and could have appreciated it better. Cute, full of puns and anecdotes. I look forward to sharing it with my daughter, which I believe to be a much more fun way of reading the book as an adult (to share with a child) than as a stand alone. For young (elementary school age) children, easily a 5/5."
3,Fantasy Fun,"This was purchased for my 11-year-old grandson, but I read about half of it before I gave it to him! It's a fantasy story, with some hidden lessons!"
1,The Book of Boredom,This book is about a kid named Milo who is bored out of his mind. He thinks he has nothing to do. I think this book was good in the beginning but then it totally lost me. It got really boring. This is the book of boredom both ways - he's bored and so was I.
1,This is the worst book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This was the worst book I have ever read. I read it last year in fifth grade and I am 11 now. DO NOT THINK OF ME AS A SMALL CHILD!!!!!!!!!I am extremely mature (I am not bragging)and usually enjoy childish books with more to them than meets the eye, but this book was just plain stupid. It was full of mathematical errors and it seemed like the author wrote some of the events just to fill up space. Those events had absolutely nothing to do with the plot and had practically no effect on the ending. I should have read this when I was 4 or 5 and actually liked this type of literature. Yes there was interesting word play, but it was not enough to make up for the total idiocy of the storyline. I simply CANNOT understand the people who like this book as it is boring and immature. I liked Norton Juster's The Dot and the Line(which is a PICTURE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!), but was sorely disappointed with the results of this waste of paper, money, ink, and time."
1,I don't recemend this to anyone of good taste!,"The following review is from my young son, who was forced to read this book at school: ""The worst book I have ever read. I had to read it for school which made it even worse! The only person I would recemend this book to would be a 3 year old kid who would think that the pictures were cool. In fact, I don't even think that the 3 year old kid would enjoy this book. The only thing good about this book are the characters."""
5,Simply Great!,"It was nice to get an updated eBook edition of this classic book! If you have only seen the cartoon movie of this story, them you need to read the book, it is so much better."
4,Grandmothers opinion,Excellent reading for your boys... I was brought to it's attention by a Grandsons Teacher. Not too good reading for an adult.
3,Good children's book,I bought it after hearing about it on a television interview with the author. It was a nice book geared toward children.
5,Food for thought,"Milo, a young, bored boy goes home one day to find a small tollbooth. in his little electric car, he drives to Lands Beyond, where he learns many lessons. It is a moral story, and explores many things as places on a map, possible to visit. And in this incredable world, Milo becomes interested. Not only is the story good, so is the writing, which is also inventive."
5,A MUST-read for children and adults alike!!,"I first read this book in school in the fourth grade and I was always wonderfully surprised and delighted at the variety of characters and the turn of events in the story. Even though I was young, I knew there was a lot of plays on words throughout the book. I just recently bought the book again and at 19 years old, I am STILL impressed with this story. It's fun, interesting, and really makes one think about life and what it's worth. It's a great story to share with others and hopefully one day I will get the chance to read it to a child and share with them this story that combines a child's imagination and an adult's artful mind. Whether 10 or 90, buy this book. I will always treasure MY copy."
5,Childhood Favorite,My 5th grade teacher introduced us to this book. It is a great play on words that every child should read!
5,What a wonderful book,"This book is just so clever. I mean the word play in this book never ends. I love all the ideas in this book, but my favorite ideas are that sounds are made and that someone plays the color in the world. I will most likely allways remember when Milo claps his hands and all the paper surrounds him. This is my third time reading this book and I highly recomend it to anyone and everyone."
5,Funny and Educational,"This story is kind of like Wizard of Oz, but better, in my opinion. We are taken to a magical and very literal world full of great characters like the Watch Dog, the Spelling Bee and the Humbug. It is funny, with a log of play-on-words jokes. With all the so-called ""classic"" literature that they make kids read in school (most of which is just boring) - this book should be something that every kid reads. Very entertaining."
3,Sinead's Review of The Phantom Tollbooth,"The phantom tollbooth is a wonderful and exciting book written by Norton Juster. I recommend it for all young kids to read .It tells a short tale of a young boy named Milo.Milo is any average kid that just doesn't know what to do with himself .When he's in school he wants to be out. When heis out of school he wishes to be in. Life for Milo tends to be boring and being lazy makes it a little worse. One afternoon Milo receives a package. He knew he wasn't good enough in school to get anything special and it wasn't his birthday. That's when he opened the package and received the Phantom Tollbooth. This book is mostly for kids who are interested in fiction and fantasy books. It's funny, lively and comes with a lesson that I think every kids and adult should learn. The strutcture is good and the words keep you excited, always wanting to know what's going to happen next! I rate this book 3 stars."
3,The Phantom Tollbooth,This book is about a boy named Milo who went on a great adventure. It was a very different book that was semi exciting. There were many odd charaters that fit this odd book. I thought it was o-k because it had a lot of school -like information .Why should we read about school when were in school!
2,Bored and Confused,It was my Mom's favorite book when she was a kid so I was almost afraid to tell her how much I disliked it. I'm a pretty good reader but I was bored and confused and found it hard to follow. It ruined the book for me...maybe if I had waited another year or two...but now its spoiled and I dont think I will go back and read it again.
2,snoresville,"They say there are certain books you have to read when you're a kid, and that if you come to them when you're an adult, it's too late. Its magic cannot be conveyed once your mind reaches a certain level of sophistication.Count this book as being on this list.. . . at least I guess so. I read it in middle age: apparently way too late. I found it pretentious, silly, unfocused, and uninspiring.In fact, I suspect I would have felt that way about this when I was eleven or so: I fail to see how I could have found the book's hamfisted punning very entertaining."
2,Not the best book ever.,"I kinda like this book, but it's pretty dissapointing. The author is named Norton Juster and is an ok writer.It's about a boy named Milo, and has always thought of things the boring and dull way. Then, one day he walks in his room to find THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH!!!! It tranports him to a new land of excitement and pure adventure. He meets many new friends such as, King Azaz, The Mathmagician, Tock, and the Humbug. As I said, the author probably didn't give their all. For instance, in the end of the book something happens that is a real bummer. But the illustrator, Jules Feiffer, can draw amazingly.The book is relatively short and has twenty chapters. So if you need a book that will only take a week or so this is the book for you. I most likely won't read this book again. But I'm sure that one person reading this review will like it. My dad read this to me when I was five, but then I would have given it ten out of ten stars because it was knew to me."
2,well written,the book was intresting.It was very exciting at the begining but toward the end of the book the story got kinda dull.It's a great quick read with lots of pictures
5,A great literary classic,"Just as my children adored this brilliant book, so my grandson adores it -- it doesn't lose its sparkle with time. Funny, clever and full of deep meanings, this great book appeals to everyone of every age. Read it to the kids before they can handle it and they'll choose to read it on their own. And the illustrations are great as well."
5,Awesome kids adventure book,"Norton Juster knows how to get into the part of a child's mind that revels in fantasy, but also shows kids the importance of knowledge and learning and using their minds. I love the ""Phantom Tollbooth"" as it is one of those books I was read as a child. I am proud to own it and my kids can't wait to get to the next chapter to see what happens next."
5,A Magical Adventure,"The Phantom Tollbooth is about a boy named Milo who comes home one day to find a present with his name on it. He opens it to find a tollbooth. Milo puts in a coin (included with present) and decides where he wants to go. He ends up in a world that is filled with consonants and vowels, and is rivaled by a world full of numbers. Milo can't imagine the endless possibilities that could happen in this magical world.I highly recommend this book to any reader with a creative mind. I also recommend this to someone that dislikes reading, only because this book is a great inspiration. Read this book and many others by Norton Juster.Joseph, 11 years of age, from R.I."
5,Very Good Book,Very entertaining for any age group. My sons and I could read this book over and over again. My favorite character is Tock.
5,Classic wordplay!,"This book is fun for all ages, one of the handful of great children's books that will still be fun to read 50 years from now. It's like Dr. Seuss for older children. Buy it. You won't be disappointed."
5,A book you will never forget.,"It has been 18 years since I have read this book. Yet, it still remains one of my favorites. The storyline is very original and very captivating. Once you start you will be taken away to Milo's world, a world that will entertain you from start to finish. So anyone ages 9-90 I encourage you to read this book. You will be glad that you did."
4,A really good book!!!,Phantom Tollbooth is a great book.I just finished reading it and its one of the best books I've ever read. It's about a kid named Milo who's always bored and finds a magical tollbooth in his room. This tollbooth leads him on a bunch of exciting adventures. This book is funny suspenseful and has a good plot. You never know what will happen next in this book. I liked when Milo meets the lethargarians because they were really lazy and didn't think. So I think that part was funny.Savannah Age:10 City: Santa Rosa
4,xmas gift,Easy to order and granddaughter was happy.Seemed to be a good fit for her age.I don't know what else to tell you.
5,A bit of nostalgia!,"I bought this book for my husband for Christmas as a bit of nostalgia...He loved it and read it all over again, just like he did when he was a kid!"
5,"One of the all-time greats, for kids of ALL ages","I loved this book as a child; I loved it as a teen. I've read and re-read it so often I've lost count, and I still love it. My teenage daughter loves it. Norton Juster spins a witty, engaging tale of a bored young man who learns a lot about life on a wild journey through exotic lands...exotic, yet amazingly familiar. The humor is droll and dry and laugh-out-loud clever; the dialog is intricately choreographed, but perfectly accessable. The storyline is exciting and imaginative, and the lessons contained herein are noble and memorable indeed. It's an allegory, a fantasy, a quest, a buddy-tale, a road trip, a comedy, and a parable, all rolled into one. Pick it up for yourself, or for the kid in your life."
5,Alberto's Review,"Norton JusterThe Phantom TollboothI like this book because it is an awesome action-packed book.It is about a boy named Milo who travels to the land of Wisdom via a magical tollbooth. He meets many unusual characters and even embarks on a quest to rescue the two princesses, Rhyme and Reason. But that means that he must travel through the Mountains of Ignorance, where demons thrive. Will he make it, or will he become a demon's dinner? This book is for anyone who likes fantasy. It falls into the fantasy genre."
5,A True Fantastic Masterpiece,"Ever Sense i got the book about 7 years ago i find myself reading over and over again. the characters are classic and the story catches you and makes you want more and more. if you're looking for a wonderful, fun, and exciting book look no further than this book. It will truly open your mind and you will see yourself cheering these characters on. Norton Juster's book THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH is truly one of the greatest novels of all time. i hope this review inspires you to give this outstanding novel a try. you'll love it!"
5,Milo's Fanasty Wolrd,"This story takes place in present-day afternoon at 5:00 p.m. It took place in a made up phantom tollbooth. It is an important setting because it makes the story more excited.This book is mostly about a young pessimistic boy named Milo and a ticking watchdog named Tock. They are in a journey to rescue two princesses named Rhyme and Reason. On the way they find new adventures each day. During some of the adventures some weird and magical things happened.In my opinion, this book is a great book for kids my age. It is exciting to read it because of it's adventures and journeys. I loved it! I would recommend this book because it is very interesting and spectacular."
5,A book that sucks you in!,"I read The Phantom Tollboth by Norton Juster. This book is about a boy named Milo who thinks everything is boring. One day Milo finds a tollboth in his room amd drives through. Milo finds himself in a different world. He meets two brothers, one love's numbers and the other one love's letters. Reason and Ryhme left (Reason and Ryhme are two sisters who can make everything right), and they have been fighting which one is better ever since. Milo decides to try to rescue them, and that is the beginning of his adventure. On his way he meets a dog named Tock who travels with him and helps him an his way. I liked this book because I like different worlds, animals that can talk, people that can fly, and most of all, meeting exquisite charcters. So I would say, ""GO TRY THIS BOOK FOR YOURSELF!"" S. Glazer"
5,"To me, it's the best book in the world!!!",Hi! I'm Katie Olson and I think the Phantom tollbooth is a very very very hard to put down book.I loved the humbug and the bumble bee.
5,very interesting and funny.,I'm Joseph Wolfond. I'm 10 years old. This is one of the best books I've ever read. I would highly recommend it to any reader ages 9-36.
4,Fun book that sometimes reaches a bit,"I didn't read this book until I was 30. I had been told by so many friends something along the lines of, ""I can't believe you haven't read it; it's too funny."" So, I bought it and read it. I had fun reading it. I thought the puns were really cute and the storyline has just enough magic in it to make it lighthearted and fun. I do, however, feel that there were times in the story were groans were more appropriate than chuckles. Kinda like the guy who just can't help but make puns even if they're not really funny and maybe are even a bit too stretchy.I bet kids as young as fifth grade could get this, but it's probably better for high school kids or middle school kids good in English.When I asked friends for their, ""Oh, you've just got to read your kids these stories"" recommendations, this one came up numerous times. Not as much as Wrinkle in Time, but frequently nevertheless.It's a have fun with it story, and not an analyze it to death story."
3,A review of the Phantom Tollbooth,Would you like to come home and find a box of thigs to make a tollbooth that took you to a imaginary land. Then The Phantom Tollbooth is the book for you. It's about a boy named Milo who isn't intrested in anything. Then he receives a box to build the tollbooth. He makes it and follows the directions to use it. Then he is sucked in to the Land of Expectation. There he has a lot of adventures. When he gets back his life isn't dull anymore.The Phantom Tollbooth is a good book. Try it!!
3,"Good, but...","This book was on my summer reading list, and I expected to like it very much cause I remember reading it years ago and loved it. I read it in 3rd grade, so, 6 years later I didn't remember much. After I finish it, I have one question. Why was this on a 9th grade reading list when it was obviously directed towards 3-5th graders. The age group is about 8-11. Not 13-15. Sure it was good, a nice break from the challenging books on our list. But it was simply childish and boring from the standpoint of a teen. So, if I was in 4th grade, I'd give it a five. In 9th I give it a one. So, I'll meet it down the middle. 3 stars."
2,Delivery and product received are just fine...The joke is this edition!,"So just to be clear...delivery was great, it was a new item in perfect condition, that's not the problem. This product was/is marketed as a 50th Anniversary Edition so, if you're like me, you kind of expect something more than a clear plastic cover over the book with a couple of pictures of the author and the illustrator...so stupid...the book itself though, for anyone who does not know is fabulous, just don't waste your money on this edition. Get the paperback for $6 instead."
1,Confusion Galore,"I really didn't like this book, I mean why would a package containing a TOLLBOOTH, be delivered into your room? What's up with that? Besides, nobody would go through it with a little car that just happened to be right next to it, they'd tell someone! DUH!!!!!!"
5,A childhood favorite.,"I tell as many people as I can about this book. I felt the same wonder about it when I was young that kids today are feeling about Harry Potter. The book creates a world all its own, and I was glad to be a part of it for a short while. Even my sister, who is not a big reader, fell in love with this book, and gushes about it to this day. I've reread it several times, and it's always just as good as the first time. To anyone who loves books, or is hoping to encourage someone else to love books, or who just has the urge for a good read, I recommend this one."
5,Awaiting my own Tollbooth to the Lands Beyond,"Here I am touring through my own muddled, middle-aging Lands beyond Youth, decrying the fact that I missed Milo's adventures ""before,"" wishing I was under the age of 13 (next criterion on the review form), yet immensely enjoying this classic that eluded me. What a delight! Yes, I continue to be an ignoramus but am experiencing a renewed youthful exuberance over the power and fun of language."
5,"Warmer than Dahl, wittier than ""Alice""","It's sharp without being mean. It isn't twee or precious. It is ironical and pun-filled, without being forced or condescending. It is obvious and subtle; it works on multiple levels for readers with widely varying reading skills and experiences. This is a book that a younger reader could finish with a real sense of satisfaction. Very close to being a kid library essential."
5,Forever My Favorite Children's Book,"THE PHANTOM TOLLBOOTH will always and forever be my favorite children's book. It was the first book I ever checked out from the library and I was captivated by its wonderful premise and clever play on words. Author Norton Juster has a brilliant mastery of using idioms and language to mold a world that is fun and literary all at the same time. It's not a simple adventure tale, rather a book that should be savored for the intelligence it brings. Juster did not dumb it down from fear that kids might not understand it. It's a work for thinking kids who love the language and figuring out the twists. Great for adults, too!"
5,I Read This Book 5 Times It Was So GOOD!,"I have read this book at least 5 times and loved it each time. It is about a boy who is bored with everything, until he gets transported to another world which has hilarious charcters, beautiful places and an adventure waiting for him. I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 5 or 6. Read this book."
5,Excellence,"I purchased this docking system for use with my XM Onyx satellite radio at home. I already had a dock at my office (XM Dock and Play XADH1), and although this is a different brand and model number, it appears to be an exact match--for about half the price I paid for the XM-branded one, BTW. Anyway, now I have XM available from home to car to office. That kinda flexibility can't be beat. Just make sure you have a clear shot at the southern sky from where you want to set it up."
3,Easy to Hook-up. AUDIO JACK TOO SHORT,"I had the Xpressrc home kit installed in a few minutes, I have the antenna facing south about 3 ft. from the window and it works good. The only BAD thing is the short audio cable, If it where my company I would have been embarrassed to have shipped something so useless, yet you have to have it. The cable reaches from the back of my receiver and to front with about 4 inches left, it is NOT long enough if you keep your components in a cabinet. For the price of this you would think perhaps a 6ft. cable is not to much to ask for. Over all to expensive for what you get, but you have to have it if you want to use it inside.Again no problem with amazon, shipped fast with great service!"
3,Does NOT work with ONYX!!!!,"I paid shipping both ways for somthing that did NOT work with XM onyx. I have nothing bad to say about the seller or product. One reviewer put that this works with the XM onyx, it does NOT!!!Do not buy this if you want to use it with the ONYX!!! Like I said, I'm happy with the seller and Amazon."
4,Xpress Home Kit,"Got the Audiovox car kit as a spare for the house, it was worth it the price was grate and quality is grate. I would recommend this item."
3,No FM rebroadcast ability,"XMH10A sales literature understates the units inability to rebroadcast an FM signal. The car unit can use a cable or the FM signal. The car and house bases both require five volts, but the power supplies are not interchangeable."
3,home kit for my xm,"The kit is easy to install, but the wire going from the xm receiver to the home stereo should be much longer. Personally the reception was not very good, but my SE exposure is not too good, I had to upgrade it with the terk outdoor antenna and now it gets perfect reception!"
5,XM home kit,I gave this to my husband for a gift and he uses it often. He was very happy with the purchase.
5,Worth the wxtra money,I wanted an XM radio for the longest time. I opted for the Audiovox Xpress RC model with the home dock. It was well worth the extra money I spent on the Xpress and the Home dock. Now I have XM at my disposal in the car and in my home. It's so easy to transfer from the home to the car. I LOVE IT!!!
3,Refurbished - I'm satisfied for the price,"I rated this 3 stars because it is a very easy to use setup and is a very good value (a steal for the price I got it for). I am not sure if every single unit does this, but I bought mine refurbished and when you plug it in it makes an annoying squeal the entire time. It can be tuned out by turning the music up on your stereo. The only complaint I have is that I really like to listen to music quietly as I fall asleep and the squeal is too loud to be able to do that. Also, the adapter continues to squeal when it is plugged in (even with the unit turned off) so after use I have to unplug it."
1,Very poor product.,"This product is not worth a dime. I bought it for some lightweight cleaning in my 3 room apartment. After the first use it showed as a very poor performer. The hose comes detached often, it does not secure in place with a twist, clip or anything. The filter started breaking down after a week and the vacuum started letting out clouds of white dust coating everything. I have cleaned all user accessible parts and replaced the filter but it still doesnt work properly. I will never buy another Eureka, ever."
3,from the heart,"This cd is music from the heart. It's a sincere attempt to lift up the Name of the Lord and glorify Him. It also speaks to the heart of people touching them where the ""rubber meets the road"". This will grow on you and you'll appreciate it honest message!"
4,10 easy ways to take advice here nad blow up UPS,"First Id like to say the product and delivery were fine. I followed all the instructions provided by Mike Murphy. They were accurate. Please add two.1) As you remove the cover to the ups back it up a few inches and remove at least one of the battery leads. This insures there is no current on the circuit board. Then continue.2) On re-assembly slide the cover almost all the way into place then attach the last lead before making that last inch of push on the cover.If you don't, you stand a chance of the cover touching the back of the circuit board and cooking the whole UPS. Then you are out the cost of the batteries and you still have to replace the UPS. By the way I should know better. So those of you who don't know better you stand a chance of cooking yourself. When these batteries are live you have high curent and possible high voltage in there."
2,Works great in the beginning....then,"I've had several of these UPS systems for almost a year. In the beginning, the units did a good job of keeping my systems running for 10 - 15 minutes if the power went out. After a year, the batteries can't even keep the systems up for 5 seconds. BUT, I think Belkin or APC will be happy to sell you more batteries for about $80 per unit. I am disappointed at how fast these batteries lost their ability to hold a charge, basically, I'm going to just throw them all away, they don't help me anymore. I think the APC UPS systems are the same way, I don't recommend the Belkin or APC UPS systems because of their poor batteries."
1,Inflated Shipping makes this not such a great deal.,"Good forks, a good product. Seller, however, is charging a ridiculously high shipping charge. $8.95 to mail 50 plastic forks? Absurd. With that add on, the price doesn't look so good any longer.Do not encourage this kind of deceptive sales practice, get them from another seller, cheaper."
3,"Good, worth watch.","This is good, entertaining, but not great. However, that being said, I would recommend it if you like foreign films and want to invest a couple of hours. I will say the impossible situation the husband/soldier was put in left me thinking for quite some time. Recommend."
3,A DANISH FILM WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES. THIS IS THE ORIGINAL DONE IN 2005.,"DEFINITELY a Scandinavian (BROODING) film. The acting is good, but the movie just is not anything special. I would not recommend it. The American version was done in 2010. It's not an especially good movie, either--with the exception of Toby Maguires performance. It really surprised me. Very Good. Very Chilling."
1,"Ouch - a pain; ""Forrest Gump goes to Cancun""","How does the author get away with this? This book was written by a woman (or a committee of women), no matter what the front cover says. I come away from reading this book with this picture: ""Look at me look at me - don't you wish you were cool, like me?""Save your time - pass."
4,Needed to replace library book,"My laborador retriever is a book chewer and I needed to replace several library books he ate. The books were cheap, exact duplicates of the ones I had lost and a fraction of the cost. Took about a week to arrive by USPS."
3,Your basic 3 day vacation throw away.,"This is the first of Jimmy's books that I've read and its not bad. The story starts out interesting enough but gets a little bogged down in the middle by the constant flashbacks and backstories. It just sort of stops moving forward for a bit and then when it does pick up it becomes way too far-fetched to the point of ridiculous. It becomes way too fantasy and unbelievable even for fiction. At the end of the story he almost seems to be in a hurry to finish up and the loose ends all become nice & tidy very convienently.I bought it at a discount ($6 for the hardcover) and read it on my Carribean cruise vacation. It was fun enough to read for a few nights at sea and a few days on the beach. I got to have a good laugh when we stopped in ""Margaritaville"" in Grand Turk and saw the parrotheads buying up all sorts of merchandise by the bagful including this paperback at $13.95"
2,Salty Piece of Land,"This is a fun book to read, nothing heavy or really serious. Parts of it can be kind of corny or unbelievable. Someone dreaming of a Caribbean escape would probably enjoy this book."
3,Not a cheeseburger in paradise.....,"Tully Mars continues his adventures in Jimmy Buffet's tale A Salty Piece of Land. First, I would like to say that I'm a pretty serious Parrot Head, so my expectations were high for this book. When we first met Tully in Tales From Margarittaville, he was heading for the beaches of Alabama to eventually set sail into the Gulf Stream Breeze.Buffet's writing style is one I enjoy, but this book didn't have the ebb and flow of a well thought out work. Tully finds himself getting high, reveling in sexual debachary and still running from his former employeer.Mar's friends and newest employeers are interesting characters, but there is a certain lack of depth to each that would have made the story better.If you are interested in just getting away for a while, then this book will allow you to grow a pencil thin mustache and offer a change in attitude.If you are looking for something that will keep you mildly intrigued, this may not be your read...."
2,Too salty piece of reading,"I just recently finished reading this book, i read many books and this book was one of the least enjoyable. I liked jimmys music but was not too pleased with this book. unbelievable encounters with not so common everyday characters. this book really doesnt have a good plot, the ""spare bulb"" chapter was agony. i recommend skippy the whole chapter. Tully Mars is running away from a minor crime ""unlawful damage to property"" Last i heard you don't get sent to prison for this, not very creative on jimmys part, not realistic."
5,Great book--great everything!,"I am a huge Buffet fan, but somebody should tell Jimmy to stick to singing! This is a rambling tale that really has no plot no beginning and no end. The main purpose seems to be to take the reader on a cruise of the Caribbean with little or no purpose. He does try and develop a cast of memorable characters, but most fall flat with no soul -- which is hard to understand given his musical genius for creating great characters in his song. There really is nothing here, I finished the book 24 hours ago and I can't even remember what it was about. The only reason this book made it to print was because the author's name is Jimmy Buffett."
3,"Hate to say it, but not the best Buffett","I love Jimmy Buffett. My daughter goes to bed to ""Come Monday"" , we take the whole family to concerts in alternate years, and I give ""Pirate"" as a gift frequently. ""Salty Piece of Land"", I just could not get through. It's just not as much of a fun read, and Tully didn't hold my attention as well in a novel as in his original novella in ""Tales from Margaritaville"". If someone else can put their finger on the difference in ""Salty Piece"", please let me know. The fun just wasn't there for me this time. Maybe next book, Jimmy."
2,Painful Read,"I was happy to get the book as a gift but was disappointed soon into the story. It is a rambling tale filled with a solid load of cheap shots at Catholics, conservatives and anything remotely American. This probably plays well with his friends in Hollywood and Long Island but gets tedious to a reader trying to follow the plot. An example of the authors weak attempt at political commentary was to kill off the antagonist, who was a poodle rancher in Wyoming, in an avalanche after she unnsuccessfully ran for Congress as a born-again, conservative Republican but lost because she was found to be into S&M with some dude in Miami."
1,Don't waste your time,"I have been a Buffett fan my entire adult life and my iPod is filled with all of his music. If yours is too, you'll be sorely disappointed with this book. It has no plot, no real story, it's just a run-on series of rambling nonsense. I had to force myself to finish it. If you're looking for some of Jimmy's truly unique blend of tropical country escapism, read Where is Joe Merchant or Tales From Margaritaville--again. Think I will, perhaps just for some redemption. p.s. The song of the same title (CD comes with the hardcover) is equally disappointing...a throwaway."
1,"book in perfect condition, book sucked",Mr. Buffet should stick to biographies and songs. This book was awful. The plot is rambling and boring and the characters are like stick figures.
5,A Salty Piece of Land,"A must read for anyone who loves the ocean and everything that it involves. Great storytelling, characters intertwined with bits of history. Loved learning more about Lighthouses and ports of call around the world. Having grown up on a boat myself, this book took me back to sweet memories of my childhood."
5,Music To My Eyes,"This book is like one long song by Jimmy . He weaves a tale of Tully Mars, the cowboy who takes his pony to the sea and goes out to find his place in the sun. Quirky characters and escapades throughout the Caribbean and coastal Mexico make this a fun and fast read. Throw in some adventures on a Schooner , the art of Flats Fishing and references to the movie The Man Who Would Be King (1975) and you have a love letter from Buffett to the things he loves and lives. There is nothing heavy or intellectual about this book and that's what makes it so fun. If you love the tales Jimmy weaves in his songs and the freewheeling lifestyle he leads then this book will give you plenty to smile about.I give this book 5 out of 5 lost shakers of salt."
3,"Mediocre at best, please stick to singing Jimmy!","I am a huge Buffet fan, but somebody should tell Jimmy to stick to singing! This is a rambling tale that really has no plot no begining and no end. The main purpose seems to be to take the reader on a cruise of the Caribean with little or no purpose. He does try and develop a cast of memerobale characters, but most fall flat with no soul -- which is hard to understand given his musical genuis for creating great characters in his song. There really is nothing here, I finished the book 24 hours ago and I can't even remmeber what it was about. The only reason this book made it to print was because the author's name is Jimmy Buffett."
1,A Guy Book,"Ladies, buy this book for your hubbie or boyfriend before going off on a vacation, but pass on it yourselves. This is very dull stuff. Tully Mars, an affable cowboy, who throws a table through a plate glass window on his lady bosses ranch, hi tails it down south of the border before the police catch up with him. There he encounters a series of supposedly interesting adventures piloting a boat, teaching fly fishing, helping the 102 year old Cleopatra steer a schooner and tend a lighthouse. Every encounter with another person along the way is an excuse for a meandering detour of a tall tale. There is in essence no plot, and no character development I couldn't wait to finish this book. No more Buffet for me."
2,DISAPPOINTED,This is the first of Jimmy's books that I have purchased and tried to read. Either I don't get it or it is just a blah book. It is such a laid-back read that I was able to lay it down and walk away. I encourage you to borrow it before deciding to buy. For me it was a waste of time and money.
3,Not Much Substance,"I love Jimmy's music and have enjoyed some of his books but I'll probably incur the wrath of the parrot heads for this........Tales from Margaritaville was a light but fun read. I thought A Pirate Looks at 50 was self serving with not much content. When I read about A Salty Piece of Land I was looking forward to reading more about the adventures of Tully Mars. It was just OK. The tales were not nearly as believable, all over the place and off the wall.A quick read barely better than watching network TV. If you're a Buffet fan try to borrow a copy, it's not worth the cover price or for collecting."
3,Subpar Buffet,"An entertaining story, but one that does not live up to the promise in Buffett's other books."
2,Needs to Reason with the Hurricane Season,"As a long-time Parrot Head and an avid reader of Buffett's earlier works (Tales from Margaritaville and Where is Joe Merchant), I was looking forward to this book. Alas, it suffers the same fate as his previous book(Pirate Looks at 50), endless rambling that does nothing to advance the plot. Also, like Pirate, I'll not finish this book either.Buffett is a master songwriter, no question. As far as novels, the man definitely needs an editor to focus, streamline, and bring cohesion to a maelstrom of imagery."
4,Somebody pass the sunblock....I need it.,"I don't know how I missed A Salty Piece of Land when it came out last month but I did. Well, the book found its way to me and I've read it and I have to recommend it to you.Jimmy Buffett is a talented performer, and a terrific song writer. Some doubt his talent as a novelist, but after reading a Salty Piece of Land I honestly don't know how they can doubt his storytelling ability. The characters in this book are wonderful and unforgettable. Perhaps the most interesting beside Tully himself is Cleopatra Highbourne. Okay, as a 103 ships captain she does stretch credibility, but why should she? The story line does get thin in places, but doesn't that happen in real life from time to time? I mean, we all have periods in our lives that are thin and un-interesting.You should find this book a worthwhile read. The story is believable, the characters interesting, the story grabbing enough to keep you turning the page. What else do you want?"
3,Jimmy misses the boat with this one,This book tells the tale of Tully Mars on the run and looking for a place to hang his hat. Now I like Tully in Jimmy's short story about him but had a hard time caring for him for the entire novel. The characters in this book seam forced and too over the top I guess he was going for laughs but I found it all rather tedious. If you want to read something by Jimmy I suggest Where Is Joe Merchant and skip this one its for die hard fans only.
3,TOO BAD I READ THIS ONE FIRST!,"I was intrigued by the title and the jacket description of this story. The first chapter sucked me in, but by about chapter 10, I was wondering where in the world this story was going. If Mr. ""B"" had just stuck to the original premise and discarded about 200 pages in the middle of the book, it would have been a much more enjoyable read. I was bored and a bit disgusted with some of the ""raunchy"" parts that had no apparent connection to the actual storyline. Guess he must have slipped off the wagon during those parts and sobered up some where around chapter 36 or so. I would have enjoyed much more the story of Cleopatra and the lighthouse to have been the focal point of the book. Sounds like, from other reviews, that maybe Joe Merchant would be much more interesting and a better value for my money spent. Think I'll just stick to his music!"
3,"Editor, please . . .","I'm an avid reader AND a parrothead, so I had great expectations for A SALTY PIECE OF LAND.Bubba does a good job with the story's set up and he ties it up pretty well at the end, but the middle seemed to wander all over the place.I was much more interested in Cleopatra's story than Tully's. I wish Bubba had built the story around her, with Tully as an ancillary character.With that said, I did enjoy the sailing stories and I have an itch to make it to Belize before it becomes too commercialized.I look forward to more tall tales, but maybe they would be better served in short story form, not held together by anything other than the binding on the book's spine.I also think Cleopatra's life and adventures deserve another look."
2,Left me wanting less,"Sorry Jimmy, this Parrothead needs more than disjointed story bites. Characters flying in and out of the story without rhyme or reason didn't do it for me. Tales From margaritaville and Joe Merchant left me wanting more Buffett tales. This one left me wanting less. The CD single was an okay song, sort of a book trailer."
2,Ultimately disappointing if you're not a Parrothead,"If you're a ""die-hard Parrothead"" and must have everything he does, you'll proably love this book. Jimmy Buffet is a good writer. But a ""novel"" needs more than just a good writer and this one doesn't deliver. ""A Salty Piece of Land"" is neither a novel nor as good as his previous efforts. There is no real story line and few of the characters are very well developed. It's like a collection of book proposals strung together.You'd be better off to read Joe Merchant again. I've read it three times. Sad to say, this one doesn't measure up. He phoned it in."
4,A salty piece of land,I read the whole book....I found the story interesting. I usually do not read very much. I have no time frame of reference on how fast or slowly that I read the book.
4,I expected more,"I'll just start by saying I'm an unabashed parrothead who would buy anything Buffet writes or sings. There was a lot of hype surrounding the release of the book, including a simulcast concert/book kickoff from New Orleans. We saw it in a theater in California and thoroughly enjoyed it. The book started out OK, but began to drag and ramble with the whole foam party thing, lengthy letters from Willie Singer with more detail than needed and making you wish he'd get to the point. There was a the cast of crazies you expect in a Buffett book."
3,A book for Buffett fanatics.,"I received this book as a gift. It is the first book I have read that Jimmy Buffett wrote. I think this book is about dreaming and having fun and not much else, not that there is anything wrong with that, it's just not for me. I like substance and meaning in the books I typically read. If you are looking for a book that is fun and throws in elements of Jimmy's songs and you're not looking for anything else from a book then this is what you are looking for."
1,It's a fairy tale?,"I found this book to be a fairy tale for ocean lovers, sunset lovers and boring escapades of the well-to-do.After one hundred pages I had to force myself to continue reading this book. I didn't want to waste the eight bucks. After 183 pages I finally gave it up. Not for me.Another reviewer mentioned Salty is a book for males. Maybe she's right. It sure didn't have any redeeming qualities for me.I would like to share my sorrow for the death of Ed Bradley with Mr. Buffett. There are many of us who loved him.M"
1,A Salty Piece of Land,"Compared to Randy Wayne White, James W Hall, Tom Corcoran, and Les Standiford this book was boring and long. If you are buying this because you are a parrot head like me don't wast your time. The other authors are excellant. FYI parrot heads the new Live Hawaii concert CD really sucked too. Off key, and too much talking. Don't waste your money. Sucess has spolied Jimmy Buffet"
5,One of the best ever!,Fell in love with Tully Mars immediately. Such an adventure! Jimmy Buffett is an exceptional author and songwriter/singer. Just thinking of Tully Mars/Jimmy Buffett takes me 'sailing thru the islands' and fills me with peace and harmony.
2,Nothing much happens...,"It feels more like a collection of short stories, a few gems among pretty routine stuff.JB's writing is extremely harmless, but I expected more ""teeth"" from the guy who wrote all those great tunes.I know this book is written for a nice lazy day at the beach, but it never really goes anywhere: a lot of plot points are recycled from ""Joe Merchant"" and Tully was more ""cool"" as a short story guy.Easily the weakest of JBs three fiction ventures.Too bad, with Florida such an easy target (I live here now also) he really could have broken new ground.All three of his books feel like they were written a year apart !"
3,This was a fun quick read...but one a real critic would really poo poo!,"I love Jimmy Buffett, and I enjoyed reading this book, but it was rather cheesy and fairly shallow. You come across several lines from his songs while reading and just think, ""Oh Jeez."" Jimmy does take you all over the Banana Republics tho and gives you some insight as to how things operate there. You have to be a parrot head to appreciate this one! I am, and I did."
5,I think I found Lost Boys Lodge!,"I loved this book and have been on a quest to find something close to the Lost Boys lodge described in the book.After a lot of Internet searching, I'm just returning from the place that I think inspired Mr. Buffett to write the book.3 hours South of tourist infested Cancun lies a wildlife refuge (state park) called Sian Ka'an. Within this refuge lies a small town called Punta Allen on a peninsula surrounded by some of the most beautiful bonefish infested flats in the world in Ascension Bay.Pesca Maya lodge lies just North of Punta Allen on an unpaved road. Noe and the guides do a great job there. I recommend Darwin or his father who are both veterans.Not sure if this is the origins of the book but I remain convinced it was the state of mind induced by bonefishing in Ascension Bay that inspired it!Great read!"
4,"Good, fun read. Liked the way songs were woven in.","This is a fun book to read in the winter (in cold regions) and dream about warmer climes. After a few chapters, I began looking for the references to songs. Recommend to any Buffett fans."
4,A wonderful reminder.,"This is so beautiful. The box is nice and simple. Inside is the CD and VHS. Short, simple, sweet and sad. This is a great buy and you should puchase it if you're a fan of Malice Mizer or Visual Kei in general. The music on the CD is stunning, and the video is a wonderful collection of moments in Malice Mizer. It is a great way to remember the butterfly in our hearts."
1,NO CD,"When it arrived today, I looked inside the cd case to find there is no CD for this! I am highly disappointed with this"
3,Possible use with DSC-T200 ???,"I haven't purchased this charger yet, but am considering it. I noticed that others have mentioned that it does NOT work with the T200. But, the accessories pamphlet that came with my T200 states that this charger requires the 'Sony VMC-MD1 Multi-Use Terminal Cable' (can be found on Amazon). This seems like such a rip-off though. You're paying $40 for a cable set that is EXACTLY the same as the one that ships with your camera, EXCEPT that it includes a piggyback dongle where the power supply plugs in.Why does Sony ALWAYS insist on making everything both proprietary, AND expensive???~Steve"
3,Sony AC-LS5K AC Adapter,"Product delivery and condition were excellent, and product works fine.Unfortunatily I made the mistake of thinking that this product would also charge my digital camera battery without having to remove it from the camera.I will probably never have a future use for it as just a power source."
5,works fine,"There is not really much to say about this product -- it works fine, the connections are secure and it has a very long cord. But to answer a previous reviewer: it would be more convenient if you didn't have to remove the batteries in order to use it but I think that capability is something you give up when you buy a small digital camera since space is at a very high premium."
2,Saves the batteries!,"The product works fine, like it is designed. However,if the camera were designed to allow a plug-in directly into the camera so the batteries would not have to be replaced by the adapter, it would be much more convenient and make a lot more sense."
2,Does NOT charge the battery in a DSC-W50,"Good for AC power, but DOES NOT charge the battery as written in a review by another customer. I lost my charger and was hoping to get an AC cord to charge the battery without removing it...this in not the product for that. This is probably only good for extended video viewing on the computer or LCD TV. If you're just transferring pictures and small video, then the battery power is enough...as long as you have a charger."
2,Not easy with a DSC-H2,"I bought this adapter, to use it with my new Sony DSC-H2. However, the H2 does not have a direct connecting for this adapter. (My previous Sony had).Although it comes with a battery replacement gadget which is easy to use. I had hoped to be able to recharge the batteries without taken them out of the camera, this does not work.Marco"
1,Check your DSC-W55's battery type before ordering this adaptor!,"Warning: The AC-LS5K adapter does NOT work with the Sony Cybershot DSC W55 camera if the DSC W55 uses a square Lithium Ion battery. Neither of the two plug-ins on the adaptor can be plugged into the camera anywhere! The adaptor is designed to plug into a battery chamber for two AA batteries, but the smaller chamber for the square Lithium Ion battery will not receive the adaptor. If your DSC W55 uses two AA batteries, this adaptor is fine."
1,...a marketing deceitiful !!!!!,"I purchased this adapter for my Cybershot model number DSC-W130 which did not come with it's own AC power cord. According to the Sony and Amazon site this adapter(ac-ls5k) was(and is) compatible but when I received it the part that is supposed to go in to the battery compartment is too wide and does not work. It is made to AA batteries Cameras. I was cheated! It's increadable something like this: Sony and Amazon says a LIE!!!! I don't want my money back, I DEMAND the right ""Battery Connecting Cord"". I made an import transaction, I am in Brazil and now? I don't like my money fired. I can't believe in that error. I bought becose Amazon and Sony said that the cord was good to my Camera.LIARES !!!!!"
3,Not satisfied,The vendor sent me the incorrect item and seemed to not understand that what they advertised is not what they sold me. I think they copied the picture and description from somewhere else. Because they sent me a different version of the adapter than advertised.
1,inappropriate part,"This does not fit the W200 as Sony(Standard Oil of New York)advertises in their fictitious owners manual. No direct AC socket, and the battery compartment is far too small. I wish I could give it a 'minus' star rating."
1,this does not work with all Cybershot cameras!,"I purchases this adapter for my Cybershot model number DSC-W55 which did not come with it's own AC power cord. According to the Sony site this adapter is compatible but when I received it today the part that is supposed to go in to the battery compartment is too wide and does not work. I am working with Sony and Amazon.com to either return it or find out how it does work, but beware if you are ordering this for the DSC-W55. I'd give it 5 stars if it did work!"
2,"Ok Book, if you are looking for the How To?","I have the view of the investor who would like to be better able to analyze announced public acquisitions and their odds of being completed. In general this book does a good job explaning basic securities laws. I am glad of reading this book. Now if any one can suggest any other book regarding mergers in deeper and with more technical information, please email me. Thanks."
3,The Africans,Well written and researched book. One wishes the writer did not use the American values to judge the wrongs and rights as if they are the world's absolute standards.
1,a slap in the face for those familiar with african history,"This book is terrible! Very superficial, comparable to Newsweek. I have lived, worked and studied in West Africa for years. There are many more positive, complex yet critical views of Africa out there."
3,"Tries to be like ""24"", but isn't.","This is a work of fiction, I wonder how people rated this book. I think based based upon their political leanings is how they rated the book. I found the book at best slightly interesting. The characters were weak and were not really developed, you could not relate to anyone. The book tried to play itself like an episode of the TV show ""24"" but lacking the real action. The book was almost lost as a spy novel or not a terrorist book. Look Clarke worked for both Republican and Democratic presidents, he knows alot and I'm sure the general public has no idea what goes on. So much is tried to be jammed into the last 20 pages, it's like doing cliff notes for WWII history. You can't believe how much he tries to jam into the last 20 pages. It's an OK read. Again depending on your political leanings is how you will like this book. None of my political leanings came into play here."
3,very interesting ideas - very poor writing,"Having studied Middle eastern history it was very obvious to me that Richard Clarke knows precisely what he's talking about when it comes to the mechanisms of power that rule both the west and the Middle East today. His vision of world politics only a few years into the future is plausible and chilling and doesn't seem very far fetched at all. I was sort of fearing that the Arabs would be the bad ones at the end and was pleasantly surprised that story was a little more subtle than that.Even though I thoroughly enjoyed the the thought provoking theories in this book, unfortunately I was equally annoyed by the poor writing and plotline. The characters are weak, the action scenes seem copied from some B-movie and fortunately there is only a hint at the mandatory sex scene.Five stars for the ideas, one for the writing."
3,"Surprisingly, a page turner","As some reviewers of Scorpion's Gate have said, the story is too obvious - the characters are not deep, and many of the characters fill in roles that are clear from the first chapter of the book. Good guy. Bad guy.Nevertheless, I was surprised to find myself turning the pages and enjoying the book. Some of the conversations between the characters seemed quite plausible, and at times riveting and - actually, funny.The foundations of the plot seem to fall into place too easily - even for a novel. Hopefully Clarke's next novel will tackle another real world scenario, but not be as predictible as Scorpion's Gate."
3,A Battle For The Future Of Islam,"What can't be said as speculation is usually good fodder for fiction. No one wants to talk about just how volatile the middle east is or has become, except for Richard Clarke. He recognizes the inevitable changes to come and how they will affect middle eastern relations, the world oil market and will probably result in the fall of the Royal House of Saud. These nightmare scenarios are the outward expressions of a much more important internal battle for the heart of Islam. Will the moderate, rational, educated muslims win over the future of this fast growing religion or will the greedy and often irrational extremists prevail? The world is watching and we all have a stake in the outcome."
3,Pretty good novel...,"i enjoyed reading it. it's a quick,action filled, thriller,not bad for a first effort! beats anything i could ever create!kinda confusing, in terms of the many acronyms, numerous cast of characters, etc.but enjoyable, nontheless. worth reading, for sure."
2,Reminded Me Why I Don't Like Most Fiction!,"Nobody can challenge Richard Clarke's terrorism and mid-East expertise - however, ""The Scorpion's Gate"" does him a disservice. It is difficult to follow, sometimes just spiteful (eg. taking a brief dig at opponents of Global Warming) and eventually boring. However it does raise some alarming plausible future scenaries.These include a coup-d-tat in Saudi Arabia, top American political leaders under Saudi financial influence, strong Chinese interest in the middle-East (as well as their becoming a strong naval power, and moving to establish a nuclear force in the former Saudi territory), Iran getting ""the bomb"" and striving to become a controlling factor throughout the region, Iraq largely following Iran's lead, and terrorism (sponsored by Iran or disgruntled Iraqis) against the U.S. Navy using a very large pirated CNG tanker.Please, Mr. Clarke - go back to non-fiction!"
4,"A great ""what if"" thriller!","Richard Clarke has an insider's view that makes the events in his novel plausible under the current political and diplomatic folly of the U.S. The characters are a bit stereotypical, and the writing a bit mechanical, but for anyone who would like to see what a knowledgable insider sees and how he interprets plausible events, then reading it as ""FICTION"" and a thriller is well worth the effort. I fear a few reviewers can't separate fact from fiction because of too strongly held ideological political beliefs, but if read just for entertainment and a little education, it is quite successful."
2,Borrring,"So much detail, so many acronyms, too much technical detail and rhetoric, not much action.Bill Kurry"
1,Dull and boring,"While the overall scenario could be imagined, Mr Clark fails at plotting either the characters nor the story the way a Clancy or a Forsyth would, the only purpose it serves is to become more afraid of American politics"
2,Self-serving fantasy,I must say I expected more than this self-serving fantasy wherein the protagonist (a persecuted and thinly disguised idealized view of the author) pursues the truth that democracy is suddenly blooming in Suadi Arabia while the rest of the U.S. Government gets it all wrong. A waste of time.
4,competent first novel,"I don't really like this type of book, but managed to finish this one having read all of it, so to me that means this is a better than average example of its kind, as I tend to dump books I don't like down unfinished."
2,A book you can pass,I was expecting too much when I got this book since it was authored by Richard Clarke. He is a newbie story teller. His writing is not suited to tell stories. It is more like a status report. I found that the story lacked depth and did not really have any interesting plot. The point Mr. Clarke stresses in this book is that America is the bad guy.
3,Editing error?,"On page 21 of the hard cover edition, MacIntyre provides the latitude and longitude of geographic position in the middle east... it's wrong. Lat. is N/S of the equator, Long. is E/W of the prime meridian."
1,Barely Disguised Political Drivel,This book is without a serious plot line. It is filled with undeveloped characters and has no drama whatsoever. It is simply a one-note political viewpoint disguised as a novel Was not worth the time and definitely not the money.
4,Ring of truth,"Unlike a lot of crappy novels I have read so far this summer, this one has the ring of truth to it. The dialogs, characters, and places all seemed real. It is a good novel."
5,"An enchanting, down to earth meditation on motherhood","While I am not yet a mother myself, I am surrounded by women who are all wonderful mothers (starting with my own!). This book is the perfect gift for these women in my life, but not just because it's a book on motherhood. It is enchanting (all of Engelbreit's books are; just look at her art work!) but it is also down-to-earth, never sappy or over-sentimental, as some ""motherhood"" books can be. There are quotes and poems and short stories about various stages and moments in the lives of mothers, and these are alternately funny, touching, witty, meditative. Sections such as "" All Mothers Are Working Mothers"", ""Let's Hear It for Mom"", and ""Dads in Shining Armour"" all seem to have been written especially for these special and incredible moms. As always, a treasure of a little book from Engelbreit."
1,Leaky Valve,"I have been using these valves for about 4-5 months now and had nothing but trouble with leaks. I have 2-1 inch valves and 1-3/4 inch valve. All of them have trouble leaking. I have even gone to the lengths of taking them apart and wrapping teflon tape around the thread around the manual pressure adjustment and checked for debris that may have been clogging the valves up but nothing helps. I do not recommend these valves in my opinion, but I cannot think of any other reason they could be leaking."
3,What happened to the War?,"I was hoping for a great deal more from this book, and at times it delivered very nicely, giving you an overview of british Asia, where you meet interesting characters, exotic locales, and bizarre customs. Then, the war comes, battles are fought, occupation becomes the norm under the japanese.And sometime around 1943, the authors stop talking about battles in any sort of detail. I'm still trying to figure out what happened at Imphal, other than the Japanese lose. We really lose the war narrative around here, and go into long passages about the Malay communist party, inter-fighting in Burma, and so on. I wasn't expecting a blow by blow military book here, but the narrative by 1943 really went off the rails."
3,Forgets to talk about the Forgotten Armies,"This is a very good social and political history of the region and period. However the title is extremly misleading as it, and the front cover (the paper back shows British artillerymen), suggests that the book will be about the soldiers who served and deal with the often forgotten campaign.As it happens actual military information in this book is very thin on the ground and in my opinion several vague and unsubstantiated military assertions are made. The main content of the book is social - political information, and this part is extremely good and given the cost excellent value for money."
1,This is not a Berkeley Highball Glass,"This image is not of the Berkeley Highball glass, but the Berkeley Water goblet and white wine glass."
2,Facile Binary Opposition,"Contempt for the party of memory on the one hand and encomiums for the party of hope on the other; no matter which tone Parrington assumes, he nevertheless gives away his own unreconstructed Leibnizianism, Hegelianism or theodicy.The Romantic Revolution in America would be more compelling without Parrington's pathologic solipsism and tautology. What he thinks of all figures whose politics he judges reactionary is captured best in this sentence: ""Perhaps it came out of a subconscious personal spleen""; however, one can't help wondering whether the ""spleen"" in question isn't really Parrington's.Whether it is Parrington here or Judis on The American Adam theme, a common characteristic of American Studies seems to be a constitutional incapacity for equanimity."
1,WARNING: Not THAT Rachels,"This is NOT the Louisville, KY post-rock ensemble featuring Jason Noble and Rachel Grimes! I made that mistake and returned it."
4,Not Very Nautical Masters Thesis,"For being a book in a series called ""Studies in Nautical Archaeology,"" this book has very little in it about boats or oceans. It reads like a master's thesis presumably because it was and primarily summarizes others' arguments. It presents nothing in the way of new archaeology and most of the arguments are nicely summed up for the average reader in Midant-Reyenes' ""Prehistory of Egypt.""Should you want all of the details as to how the conclusions were arrived at along with some fairly illustrative diagrams and sketches, this book might be of some interest. It also has a good survey of the very un-nautical Narmer Palette.Contrary to the dustcover (on which, ahem, someone seems to base her reviews in lieu of actually reading the book), only one shipwreck is discussed and even that is mentioned only in the final chapter, the only part of the book that focuses specifically on seafaring."
1,Where is Quaker Puffed Wheat,"Quaker Puffed Wheat is what I've been craving. Generic brands is what I've been having to make do with.Ordered this Kellogg product as an experiment. The experiment is over and now I'm plotting how to give away all of these tiny boxes.AVOID this cereal. I LOVE PUFFED WHEAT, however, this particular brand tastes almost exactly like the wax paper it is sealed in."
4,Good,Exactly what I expected. I like the book. Well made and informative. Thank you. A ok A ok A ok A ok A ok.
3,Rock And Roll Salvation,"Taking in consideration that this book was probably unique in 1986, I found the whole idea of Rock and Roll, in this case: Wrack and Roll, playing a key role in world politics, nuclear war, etc, a little much....but...the characters and dialogue move along at a rocking pace, that's for sure! Part cyberpunk, part alternate history and very humourous...I devoured this book. I particularly loved the antics of the cynical, alcoholic physicist who is a pawn for both sides: the Wrackers - the rebellious, anti-establishment types and the Straights - the established followers of order. There is plenty of conflict between the two sides even when the lines become blurred but the book becomes bogged down in it's idealistic view of the power of Rock and Roll."
3,Great.....until the last half hour.,"This movie was a great, feel good, imaginative kids movie....3 outcasts, building their dreams, and doing what all kids would love to do...fly their own homemade spaceship. Then the aliens showed up. Silly rubber outfits, and worn out old tv standby gags....ruined the film for me. But it was great until then."
3,"Not on a level with The Last Starfighter, but fun for kids.","My son and I agree with another reviewer that it was good until the end, when they came up with these poorly designed rubber aliens, with really bad lines. I do not agree that the foul language was necessary, it really never is. There are many young people who do not use that kind of language, even with their peers. This is a fun movie for younger children, except for the language, which is mild and infrequent compared to most movies."
5,Explorers-I Love The 80s DVD,"I lived in the 1980s when I was young child and I remember the movie... ""EXPLORERS"" in 1985 and it was on Television screen. Now I recently bought this DVD of Explorers-I Love The 80s...it brought me a memories of flashbacks is like going back into 1980s era. I really recommend anyone to watch this funny and memorable movie of the 1980s...Explorers!"
3,good for the time,"Good movie for kids that likes adventure, spaces and freindship...i dont realtor like the plot whit the extraterestrial.....my husband like the movie as à kid si he essor realtor happy to see It again and he Will want see kids to see It also"
3,Almost a Heinlein juvenile turned into a movie...,"---...with an unfortunate emphasis on the ""almost.""The acting and directing talent devoted to EXPLORERS is impressive, and the production values are practically perfect. What gives this film a less-than-stellar place in the movie pantheon is precisely what most of the customer reviews condemn: those clownish damned aliens who are slugged into the third act in lieu of a climax.All the tension-building so delightfully provided in the first two-thirds of EXPLORERS is wasted by a blow-off that fizzles in a fashion that gives new meaning to the word ""disappointment."" Instead of slapstick, the characters and their efforts warranted something serious, something as good as what you'll read in a *real* Heinlein juvenile (see HAVE SPACESUIT, WILL TRAVEL for the perfect example), making this a peripubescent ""buddy"" movie that would have been honest-to-ghod memorable.Instead of what it is -- which is exceedingly ""almost."""
2,Disappointing!,"Okay, I do like this movie but I have seen a much longer version than this on network TV. I brought this video version of this movie last week just because I thought it will have new scenes. But guess what it's only the original version that was filmed in the theater, no new scenes. I wish I can take my video back and wait for the DVD version to come out so that they can show the deleted scenes. If you want to see a longer version of this movie you can catch it on TBS Superstation or TNT if it ever comes on again on those channels it will have the new scenes. Trust me!WARNING - If you buy this video you won't see the new scenes that were shown on Network TV it's just the original version that was filmed in the theater no new scenes. Sorry!"
2,Explorers Finds No Audience,"A film notable for having a young River Pheonix and Ethan Hawk in the leads. EXPLORERS starts out interestingly enough with a great premise, decent special effects, scientific jargon, and a likeable cast of young stars, but then it falls flat. Three pre-teen guys (two geeks and a freak) build a spaceship (a very inventive and high concept idea by the screenwriters). Then, they go off to find aliens. Once the young ""explorers"" meet up with an alien race who speak ""American television"",because the aliens have been receiving the televison signals to their planet, the story becomes vague, muddled and somewhat of a letdown. Also, the alien(s) repeating quotes from film and television programs becomes irritating and old right away. Overall, there are high production values to the film, interesting script ideas, and a likeable youg cast, but ultimately falls short. For a story that dares to explore, it goes nowhere."
1,Possibly the Worst Movie Ever?,"A truly terrible movie. It was slightly interesting because it had a young Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix in it, but mostly, just bad. Even the campy parts were too bad to make it worthy of any kind of a cult classic status.Put it this way: my 8 year old twins - who loved ""I Was A Teenage Dragon Slayer"" (another truly terrible movie) - both agreed that this was a bad movie."
3,Pretty good for kids.,"This is a pretty good show for kids. It's a little old and dated now, but, it is tough to find movies that are suitable for children anymore."
3,"So close, yet so far","I stumbled upon this movie in our family's archive of recorded videos. I was caught into watching it from the very beginning, a great story, and the acting was good. Then in the last 30 min. of the movie everything went terribly downhill. Either someone was trying to make a point or they ran out of budget, but believe me this movie is not worth watching, well the end anyways. Watch it only up to the point where they get into space, then turn it off. You'll be much happier."
2,left short,"the movie was a gift for my son {20}. It was one of his favorite childhood movies. The one we purchased,for $20 dollars, was a cut version that was not told to us. We broke out his old VCR version taped off the TV and it was less cut than the Xmas gift. so sad. Mom"
5,It is the perfect commentary on the 50's genre of sci-fi.,"Three kids are sent blueprints telepathically for building a space ship, so that the alien who is ""sending"" the blueprints can meet them. The Explorers has one of the most ingenius and inventive depictions of a First Contact ever filmed, in my humble opinion. The main alien is a masterpiece of make-up, costume and hydraulics, not to mention genuinely entertaining wit and satire.."
3,I liked,"My kids do not have the same taste as me. When I was younger, I loved this movie. I cannot get my kids to watch the whole thing without getting bored."
4,Great movie,"This movie is one of those that really draw you in from the beginning, as you are able to associate with the characters from your own childhood experiences. The story brings it all together in kind of a wizard of oz type way."
3,Explorers a real treat,"Remembering this movie is from the mid eighties, you'll be quite impressed with the special effects, and the lighthearted story is entertaining. I got a real kick out of the terrible alien creatures but it was sad to see the acting talent of a very young River Phoenix and know it would be cut short. All in all, not the amazing movie you might remember if you haven't watched it since you were a kid - but definitely worth watching if you've got kids of your own or if you like to reminisce."
5,Still Good,"I haven't seen this in a very long time. I have to say, it still makes me laugh. Its effects still look pretty good today. The actors were all the right ones for the parts they played. It's a good romping movie. It's also, I think, everyone's dream when they are a kid. I mean, how many of us wished we could have done this? How many would have killed to do this? It's a good ""family"" movie as well. Yes, there is the scene where they sip from the beer, but it isn't like they are knocking back a six-pack. Most of it gets squirted around as if it were champagne anyway. It is still a very good movie even after all these years."
3,Watch Out for The screen,Had it in the leather case and in a planner book but pressure on it made the screen go wierd and break easily
5,Christmas,This was a Christmas present for my Dad. He loved it! It fits his weapon perfectly and he says it's very comfortable to wear. Thank you!
5,Quality product,I was happy to find a quality replacement product. It was the perfect size. It arrived on schedule and was well packed. I am happy to find all sorts of product i want on Amazaon.
5,Awesome!,"My replacement carafe showed up this afternoon and it was perfect.The glass seems thicker that my last carafe, which was by Bodum.This replacement fit perfectly into my Bodum press holder and all the parts work perfectly. So, if you need to replace your 8 cup Bodum press then you have a less expensive alternative right here!(And the shipping was FAST)."
1,Broke After 1-2 months,"I ordered this in mid-December, and now the carafe is broken on Feb. 17th. I used it two or three times per week. But today it broke for no apparent reason. I poured in the hot water, and after 10 minutes pushed the plunger down. 5 minutes after that, I poured myself a cup. Then, about two minutes after I set the press back down on my desk the carafe cracked down the middle and coffee started pouring all over my desk. This is a poorly made carafe."
5,great buy!,"This is a great product---and much more affordable than the name brand option. Bodum users with broken carafes---this is a great buy! My 9-m-o son loved the box to play with, after we'd removed the carafe. :)"
5,"Thanks Bonjour for providing this environmentally friendly, economical option...",The glass in mine broke BUT...I'm so glad I can still save money & be eco-friendly by purchasing the replacement beaker rather than throw the whole french press in the landfill! Thank you Bonjour :)
4,This coffee press carafe is a smash!,As in we are on our 3rd as we break them too often. Suprisingly it is not the kids but the other adult in my house who keeps breaking the french press pot- jittery hands? perhaps it is time for the decaf... Great fit great coffee worth the drama of broken glass and replacement.
3,Not all I hoped for,"Hoping that the universal design label was true, I bought this as a replacement for my Bodum press. The fit is loose. Fortunately I had an old Bonjour press in the back of my cupboard that works nicely. Bodum buyers, this is not your best choice."
4,Very good,"I was very curious to read this book depicting, although in fiction, life in Italy during war time. I found an enjoyable novel about love, fear and courage; in the end it appears that, in desperate times, the distance between cowardice and heroism can turn out to be very short."
1,A Dissenting Review,"While I have enjoyed reading the book, I would nothave purcased it had I known how little it actuallycontains about the rooms. As someone interested inaudio engineering, I was hoping it would have a lot ofinformation about the rooms themselves, with dimensions,acoutic treatments, unusual equipment used, etc. Instead,the book tells the story of the studio mostly aroundwhich artists recorded there. I don't really need tosee a list of who recorded for Sun Records, I want toknow what Sam Phillips did to make the room sound the wayit did. I want details of the famous Capitol echo chambers.This book does not provide the sort of informationthe title implies."
5,Great Muhammad Ali book for Youngsters!,"The pictures are exciting and the while the reading is difficult, older students could do it. Many students admire Muhammad Ali and the photos will please their eyes and the information will soothe their minds. Ali didn't have a sex scandal, and his arrest was inappropriate and overturned by the Supreme Court. He is an exciting person that kids can look up to."
2,Initially a little disappointed.,"I purchased and just received two of the Kidde smoke alarms. It's too early to give a full evaluation of these alarms but I was very disappointed to find that one of the alarms was dated July 27, 2011. That makes that alarm 1 1/2 years old upon delivery. I'm willing to consede 6 months but 1 1/2 years. The units have a 10 year life from the date labeled on the back of the unit. Beside this issue, the units appear to work very nicely."
3,Larger than Expected,"Didnt realize unit is almost 6"" in diameter, not really aesthetically pleasing.One would think with technology, they could manufacture a slimer model.Also, it does not fit the base mount of other Kidde models.I hoped I could swap out detectors without having to drill other holes in the wall for the mount.I had purchased new Kidde detectors last year, and decided to replace with the dual sensor model.As a side note, there's nothing on the face of the unit that indicates its a dual sensor."
4,KIDDE PI000,"I bought these DUAL Sensors to replace the older SINGLE detector units based on research and credible advice found on the Internet. The price was reasonable, the design accomodating (especially the 'HUSH' button feature) and the installation a breeze. I plan to replace the others in my house with these units."
1,4 of 6 failed within two years,"I purchased 4 Kidde PI9000 Dual mode detectors to replace working, but old detectors in our home. One failed within a month and after returning to Kidde at my expense they replaced it. Took at least 4 weeks to get the replacement. A few months later another failed, again I sent it back and received a replacement. Now at less than 2 years, two more have failed. I bought 4, I've had 4 failures, and I have two working at the moment.The failure mode for the units was a constant chirping, the same sound they make when the battery is low, except on the failed units changing batterers, even different types would not stop the beeping.I can't see how this failure rate is acceptable by any standard."
3,Item failed in a year.,"I purchased several of these alarms for use in our home's bedrooms. Today, I came home to the sound of a smoke alarm going off. In our bedroom.I rushed upstairs, but all seemed to be well. The alarm was continuous, just like an actual smoke alarm, rather than a low battery signal, which has a longer pause between beeps. I changed the battery, and the result was the same. It didn't matter that there wasn't -- thankfully -- so much as a spark or whiff of smoke in sight (or smell.) I took an identical alarm out of another room and placed it in our room. No alarm. And, yes, the self-test worked.Looks like I'll have to buy another. I am only glad that the alarm didn't go off at, say, three am. I can only wonder if the unit would have worked in the event of an actual fire, as I have no way of diagnosing the cause of its malfunction. Needless to say, I'm strongly considering finding a comparable unit from another manufacturer."
5,Much easier to set up and better than 'First Alert' dual sensor.,"I had purchased the 'First Alert' dual sensor alarm (with remote feature), and it gave me nothing but false alarms, some in the middle of the night! Not so with the Kidde. Plus getting to and installing the 9V battery was much much easier on the Kidde than on the unintuitive 'First Alert'. This Kidde dual sensor alarm is the way to go if you want simplicity, ease of use, and peace of mind. I think I am going to purchase a few more now that I know this model works flawlessly."
1,2 out of 3 died in two years,"I bought 3 of this in September 2008, and as of now, July 2010, 2 out of them have already died within two years. They died in the same way: just beep for nothing and would not stop. If you push ""HUSH"" button, then they silence for 10 minutes and resume beeping for nothing. This is crap, expensive crap!"
3,Significant number of failures,"I have created a 9 volt power supply for my main residence and a vacation home, used to power dual sensor smoke alarms, that are tied into my security systems. First Alert sensors at the vacation home repeatedly false alarmed. I replaced the two there with pi9000 Kiddes. They have worked fine for well over a year. However, not so ""lucky"" here at main home. I bought 4 to replace 10+ old dual sensor First Alerts. One only is working fine so far ( 1 week). But the other three are failing. They will, after several hours on the 9 volt supply, suddenly drop the voltage in the system, and an ammeter shows they are pulling over 150 ma! This must be what is happening to others folks who are reporting failures. There is some component in these units, not all of them, that is failing. Now what do I do? When not failing, these are the best dual sensor units on the market, but how many do I have to buy before getting the ones I need?!!"
2,Not very good quality,"I got four of these and I do not recommend them. One failed shortly after install. I tested one next tho an old type of smoke detector, made some smoke in the kitchen and not only the old one set off by the smoke quickly but the Kiddie did not even put out on peep.Not impressed."
2,Two out of three? Not if there is a fire!,"I ordered three of these devices. Two work as they should. The third is a dud, did not work straight out of the box. As I live overseas, the cost and hassle of returning the item is not worth the value of the item. Better to buy this type of device in a shop where it can be tested before leaving."
1,Too many false alarms!,"We have owned this alarm for about 6 months and tried using it in two different houses with open kitchen/living room floor plans. We have open ceilings and did not install it at the highest peak (we installed it at the location easiest to get to standing on a ladder or chair). Ours goes off all the time, falsely, even when there isn't something to ""explain"" it, i.e. I was cooking and the stove got hot or someone took a steamy shower, etc. The only way to get it to stop is to remove the battery. It has been a big annoyance -- and Kidde's customer service team is not great. Overall, I would not buy this brand or type of alarm again."
1,Lasted 1 year and now tries to save me from humidity,"Perfect for one year exactly. Then it started going off in humidity, except it's located in the hall outside the bathroom. So unless I remembered to take it off before I took a shower, it invariably went off about 3 minutes into a shower, with a steady loud shrill. I changed the battery. I tested it regularly throughout it's life. Goes to show, you get what you pay for. Ironic that a smoke detector tries to save me from excess humidity."
2,Two out of three failed in a year,"Two out of three units I purchased over time, failed after about one year of use. I guess I will try different brand now.."
2,Failed after 3 years,I purchased four PI9000 smoke alarms (from Amazon) about three years ago. One has failed thus far. I'll update this if there are more failures. The 10 year limited warranty from Kidde sounds great but really isn't: they require you to pay for both the postage to return the defective item and the return postage for them to send you the new unit. Why should I have to pay for the return postage when their product was defective? I don't believe that First Alert requires the customer to pay for return postage so next time I'll purchase from them.
4,like it,Like the product because of it's detection capabilities re smoke and heat. I would be glad to recommend it to anyone.
4,Great,"This is a great product, showed up on time and was as advertised. The only way you could improve this would be to have it run on the house hold current and have the battery as a backup."
1,Failed After 3 months,Kidde PI9010 Battery-Operated Dual Ionization and Photoelectric Sensor Smoke AlarmFailed after 3 months. Checked battery everything Ok. Would not stop false alarming.
1,Not interconnected - major flaw,"___From the product description: ""a single unit smoke alarm"". This means that if the alarm in one room detects fire, the alarms in other rooms do nothing. Find a detector that is interconnected, ie the alarms everywhere in the house go off.___""According to Wikipedia: In new construction, minimum requirements are typically more stringent. All smoke detectors must be hooked directly to the electrical wiring, be interconnected and have a battery backup...""___This is serious stuff about a fire in someone's home or I wouldn't be so dramatic.[...]"
3,How does one review a smoke alarm ?,"It certainly LOOKS like a good smoke alarm, but I guess I won't know for sure until I have a fire !"
2,High failure rate,Good ratings but bad quality. My experience is similar to others here: half or more of the units fail (random peeping) within a year or two. After replacing several units with the same results I'm moving on to another brand.
5,Good customer service,The alarm started using one battery a month (not an AC alarm) after 3 years use. Called Kidde using the number on the smoke detector and they sent a free replacement. Not thrilled it started using batteries but they took care of it quickly with no problems.
5,Works well. Good price too.,"Haven't had this long but it seems to work well. Has a loud alert, and went off quickly after I burned some onion rings one day :)For 20 dollars I don't think you could ask for more."
2,kidde smoke alarm,We ordered 3 and two work wonderful. One has constantly gone off no matter where we put it in the house. It is defective but the literature says you have to return within 30 days. It was 2 weeks before we put these up and it worked for about 1 and 1/2 weeks. It goes off if it is even laying on a table. Changed batteries and nothing stops it.
1,Didn't last two years,"I never tested this to see if it works (i.e. burning toast, etc...) but the test feature works. I hope to never have to hear this thing go into alarm mode... but if the unfortunate need does arise, I hope this thing answers its call to action!UPDATE November 2010:This alarm went off in the middle of the night (no fire/smoke/or anything else)... and refuses to stop alarming. This happened once before, and was easily resolved by cleaning the unit with compressed air. This time, however, compressed air was not able to help, so I'm not sure if it's a dust issue, or something else. This unit isn't even two years old now, so I'm a bit disappointed in it's performance."
1,Failure,"After a year, this smoke detector would go off continuously even with fresh batteries. Since the First Alert dual sensor smoke alarm is even worse than this one and I don't want to be burned alive in a fire, I pretty much had no choice but to buy another one. Cheap Chinese made crap!"
1,Unhappy,"I bought this smoke detector in May 2009 and now in Oct. 2010 it has stopped working, just beeps for no reason at all. Yes, Kidde has a five year guarantee, but I must find something to prove I purchased it and send it back at my expense and pay for them to send it back to me. This stinks. I will just buy a new smoke detector. This time one that costs less and not from Kidde if I can find one."
1,Useless,We have bought two - the first falsely sounded the alarm and we couldn't turn it off - the second in around three months also had false alarms - very upsetting - anyone have any suggestions as to a decent smoke detector on the market? This one is a waste of money.
4,Decent smoke detector,Picked it up on a discount via a company initiative to ensure everyone had adequate smoke detectors in their homes. It was easy to install and seems reliable.
5,home owner,brought this for the basement stairway so in case of a fire you could see the way out it installed easy and works great load and the light is very bright would recommened to all that are in need of a great smoke detector with a bright lite to see your way to saftey.
5,Easy to use and install,"Easy to use and install. Only had it go off once from an errant cooking fiasco, but that ensured me that they do indeed work. I'm happy with the device."
5,Flawless so far,"I installed two of these a couple days after delivery. That was a simple job, and there have been no false alarms. They replace First Alert dual models which were 10 - 12 years old. I checked reviews on the Kidde and the current First Alert versions. The latter did not give me much optimism, and their remote control feature is a non-starter for me."
2,Failed in 8 months,"Two stars because it worked fine for 8 months. The three or four times the kitchen had smoke, this started beeping. After 8 months it started beeping again with smoke and wouldn't shut off. The back says ""clean annually using compressed air or a vacuum hose. I tried this and it still won't stop beeping whenever the battery is in. I replaced it two months ago, and tried it again today, one last time before throwing it out. Same problem. My last Kidde stopped beeping at all after a month. I'm trying another brand."
1,Don't buy this product,"I bought two Kidde P19010 Battery Operated Dual Ionization and Photoelectric Sensor Smoke Alarms last year (2012). They were for my rental house bedrooms as I had to comply with a new city ordinance. Well to my dismay they both failed between 6-7 months after their installation.After reading reviews of this product it looks like others are having this same problem. I will have to find a suitable replacement, don't buy this product."
1,Failed in little over a year,"Piece of junk. Like others with this unit, it failed in a little over a year (no test.) In addition, gave many false warnings. You do not want a smoke alarm that ""cries wolf"" lest you ignore it when it's going off for real. In addition, check out the 10 year warranty: Kiddle expects YOU to pay shipping BOTH ways to replace THEIR defective product. At the cost of shipping these days, it renders the warranty pretty much useless. Although Kiddle could gift wrap and deliver it to my door and I'd still dispose of it."
3,1 out of 4 didn't work,Ordered 4 of them and one of them didn't work. Other then that they seem to be okay. House hasn't burned down.
1,Poor quality control,"Like many of the previous reviews, one of the several units I purchased just failed last night and it is only a few months old (although the manufacture date is almost a full year). The worst part is that it decided to fail at 1 AM...it's hard to fall back to sleep after an adrenaline rush like that.I used to buy the small cheap First Alert basic detectors that worked just fine. Then I decided to upgrade. Lesson learned.UPDATE 10/9/12: another unit failed this past weekend - at least this one failed at 9 PM. I'm going to replace the rest of the units I still have. Kiddie blew it with this model."
3,"Informative about the many ""native"" Korean Martial Arts but several look like copies of other Martial Arts.","Filming was okay, several displays were flashy and stunning. Good enough if you just want to broaden your knowledge. Not in depth but similar to ""flash cards"","
4,the best sound ever,"I really enjoyed the dolby 5.1 of this... it really makes you wanna test your equipment more and more. I can assure you are going to play it many many times, so more than a movie its a record for ever. Thank god they are selling cool artist blue-ray now, because it was full of really old taste bluray discs all these last years."
4,Solid value for an everyday need,"I have been pleased with this 6 outlet surge protector so far. I's been in use now for several months and one of the things that I like the most about it is the way it utilize the center screw for mounting. I am always frustrated when an entire unit comes out with a single plug and this solves that issue - just be aware that it does require this type of mounting before you buy.I have been through a couple of storms with it to date without issue and the only thing that I find unpleasant about it is actually the indicator light. That green light bugs me, but it is just a personal preference and nothing more.I have been able to use all the slots but I tend to put this where I am not using bricks - for lamps, computer charging, etc. I have been able to strategically place my Eneloop battery charger pointing up as well and have found myself coming back for a few more to round out the technology infused house."
4,nice product,Gives you three times the outlets as a standard wall box with some minimal surge protection. The ability to attach it to the wall with a screw is a nice touch. The weight of the cords plugged into it can't pull it out of the wall outlet.
1,Dead after a few months,Purchased this to use in the kitchen. It worked for about 8 months and then just went dead one day while brewing coffee.
3,One of the two I ordered did not work,"One works fine, but the other worked for less than a minute and then stopped working--no more light, no more power. I'm returning it for a replacement, and expect Amazon's usual good customer service. Also, I realized that they needed to be installed upside down, as the outlets I put them in are installed 'upside down.' Not a big deal (I can always turn the outlets around if it bothers me), but I hadn't realized that when I ordered them."
5,Great product,Great product. It is a great space saver when a surge protector is needed and there's not enough space for a traditional power strip. It also gives one fewer cord to manage. I probably have 2 dozen or more of these in service in office and chemical laboratory environments and I've never had one fail.
4,A solid piece,This is a pretty good wall mount outlet. So far so good. Runs my entire entertainment system. An on off switch would have been good.
4,Belkin 6 Outlet wall mount surge protector,Please be aware that this outlet can only be used with a duplex receptacle having a center screw. Ours did not and we had to get an electrician to put in a new receptacle. Otherwise it is great.
1,Sockets are Too Small..!!,I got this to use with my TV (LG LM8600). It has a standard 3 prong plug that will NOT fit in this outlet..!!! .. UGH!! .. Unbelievable!
1,Didn't work,"Unfortunately the item didn't work. If you pushed it hard against the case, the lights would light, but normally wouldn't. Poor quality. Have bought Tripp Lites and think their quality is better. Amazon accepted return, no questions asked."
2,You can't use all the outlets,"This looks nice and it is compact, but it only works if you have only one or two larger chargers. The larger chargers can only go in one way, so they block the plugs below them. I can only get two in (bottom ends) and then straight plugs into the other two outlets. Two are wasted."
4,Good Product but Outlet Spacing Could be More Generous,"The product does what it is supposed to with allowing you to expand a normal 2 outlet wall plug to 6 outlets with surge protection. I'm using it to protect a home AV setup. With all of today's large clunky wall plugs, it would have been nice to have the outlets spaced further apart. I own 3 of these now and most of them can only accomodate 4 plugs due to the cords. I also like the ones that have a built in USB charge ports along the top (which this one does not have) so that is worth considering to reduce the number of plugs needed."
4,The SurgeMaster 6,"I like the design of this product, because it allows you to connect different appliances and electrical appliances in another wall outlet and not on the floor. I bought extras so that I would have them when needed. ""A Great Buy"".Vable Welch"
4,Great if it protects as it should,"Easy to use, just plug it in and looks fine too. If it works as intended to protect the computer and other plugged in devises from power surges or lightening, it is great, although likely I will never know for sure. If others say it worked, then it's a great buy from Amazon, being less than 1/3 the cost I see in stores."
1,Have not yet received product,Have not received product yet for over one month ...Where is it? TERRIBLE....I would like someone to contact me...where is my product?
3,Tripped circuit breaker after one night,This would have been nice for the price but after one night it tripped my circuit breaker and now the ground light is no longer working. I do not trust this product now and am in the process of sending it back to the company for a replacement. I am required to pay for return shipping so the price probably just doubled. It would be nice if Belkin tested their products before they packaged them up and sold them.Update: I have since returned the defective unit and the new one has been working great for over a year now. I am likely going to order another. I just hope it isn't defective.
5,It works just fine,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my aunt and uncle and so far they have not complained so it must be good.
5,worth the price,What can one say except great value and peace of mind to protect electronic gear for the price. Just make sure not to overload you amps rating for the items you plug in.
4,Yay power strip that isn't a strip,"I do enjoy this wall power strip, the only thing I don't like is that since all of the outlets are vertical, large power plugins get in the way of the other outlets more easily than it would if they were rotated."
5,AMAZING PRODUCT!!!,"Fast shipping, great value, packaged very well. Excellent to keep your items safe and use less wires. Make sure to look for coupons as I did and save extra money. In addition this place was less expensive than anywhere else for this item. A++++++"
5,Surge Master,I usually buy the regular 6 outlet wall plate but I've decided to add this extra safety feature of the surge protector especially for extension cords.
2,"Designed to Be Replaced, Not Reused","I bought one of these to plug multiple appliances into a kitchen outlet. It worked fine until someone tried to use three things at the same time. To be fair, this product did its job and tripped. The problem is, there is no breaker to reset, or even an accessible fuse to replace. It only worked for a few weeks, and now it's a solid-state piece of e-waste. If you buy this product, plan carefully and don't plug too much into it!"
5,Belkin SurgeMaster Wall Outlet,I have searched for a good quality Wall Surge Protector and found this one. I no longer have cords laying on the floor with the older power strip outlet I had. Very pleased.
2,It didn't work for me,"It didn't work for me. My external modem, my Linksys wireless router, and my desk top computer were fried. The modem and wireless router were connected to the same surge master. The desk top was connected to a different surge master. This took place during a thunder storm 2 weeks ago. In conclusion, if you want real protection don't buy this product."
2,Got overheated,"I used this power surge for two months and it broke. I only had three cords plugged in but it got overheated and does not work anymore. Belkins has a warranty but I have to spend about half the purchase price in shipping to send it back for a new one.It will be costly if it constantly breaks and have to pay for shipping each time. If my replacement breaks again, I will try a different manufacturer."
2,Peg in back doesn't allow to be plugged in fully,"It seems to work ok, but the peg in the back of the wall-mount isn't far enough down. It makes the bottom of the plug stick out so it isn't flush with the wall. I will have to see if my husband can remove that when he gets home. Otherwise, it works just fine."
3,Physical design if flawed,"The problem I had with the Belkin SurgeMaster is obvious from the picture: The plugs are pushed to the very edge of the device. The screw moved up with them. So when you screw the adapter to the outlet, the device does not have enough top margin to cover the hole in the wall at the top of the outlet. It doesn't look very good, and it leaves the hole open for insects. They should have added a centimeter of extra margin to prevent this problem."
4,6 outlets,"I bought this for the extra outlets, the surge protection is a bonus... still waiting for a huge lightning strike to see if it works."
4,like it,"This is a good product and gives consistant surge protection. The only thing I do not like about it is it does not screw into the wall, comes out of the wall, making it inconvenient to have to keep plugging it in."
2,Belkin SurgeMaster 6 outlet review,With this device you are required to remove wall plate and screw this on to the outlet. This would be fine however the device does not cover the outlet completely on the top edge. Would be fine if hidden but in my case the unfinished look was exposed.
3,Works as advertised but...,"An adequate surge protector but i had one unexpected design flaw. To secure it to the wall outlet you need to use the center screw. The problem is that all my outlets (and some more modern outlets) don't have a hole for center screws. Why is this important? The protector is bulky and if you just pull on a cord attached to it, it can pull out the entire protector. Simple enough to hold the wall outlet against the wall and then pull out a power cord."
2,Strictly for beginners,"The two small applications the author leads you in building will get you moderately comfortable with the Delphi environment.But the book is more notable for what it leaves out than what it includes. If you're looking for how to work with such common Windows components as list and combo boxes, text boxes, check boxes, scroll bars, etc.; or how to code Pascal (the programming language on which Delphi is based), you won't find it here. Check this book out of the library if you can--but save your money for a more comprehensive one."
5,empowering and exciting...,It is a huge turn on to read what other women are thinking and fantasizing about. I found that my sexual fantasies weren't so outrageous after all and discovered quite a few new ones that were very arousing. Open any page to find a vivid vignette of sex and seduction...delicious!I will be keeping this book next to the bed for easy access! It's just the thing to get your motor running.
2,The Black Lace Book of Women's Sexual Fantasies....,"This book touches on aspects that I found more of the socio typical men would enjoy. As I am not into women on women or multiple partners at once I was not enticed by the ""erotic"" stories within the book."
3,Surprising...fancinating... NO !,"I was expecting a blow-the-door revelation on fantasies. But it seems nothing has changed in the years. Nevertheless, the content and the depth of these women's fantasies were widely varied."
2,A man with unbelieveable character,"Frank Smith was truly a man with ideas before his time! He fought and sacrificed to ensure everyone had the same rights that are guaranteed all under our Constitution. This was unheard of in the segregated South in the '50 and '60s. ""Mississippi Liberal"" is an excellent history of the Mississippi Delta and the environment that shaped the ideas and life of the Congressman from Mississippi--Frank E. Smith. A man who worked hard to make a difference for all races... and he did! A very comprehensive work by Dr. Dennis J. Mitchell--A superb job!"
3,OK for physics review,"not the best mcat physics review book, IMO. the list of formulas is nice but other than that, just an OK book."
3,"Upbeat Pop/Rock, Nicolette Does It All","Nicolette's third release is definately her most upbeat and danceable. I agree, it's not techno/disco or anything of the sort. Just pop-rock mixed with a little country. In fact, the only ballad is ""Long Distance Love.""The best track is ""Ooo-Eee"" with prominant background vocals by Linda Ronstadt. This has gone down as Nicolette's lesser appreciated albums, but it has a good many moments and fans of Nicolette never complained."
5,A Journey,"This is one of those books that stays with you, and bears re-reading 20 years later. Accessible to youth, and quite worth reading by adults who come across it for the first time - adventurous, enlightening and sometimes emotional."
4,Good book even though I like other Heinlein books better,"Of the 31 Heinlein books I own, I'd say this one ranks somewhere in the middle. Thorby (the main character) is not Heinlein's strongest hero but I think he's one of the most adaptable. Since he gains control of a major holding company before he's 25, he's not a doormat since he starts the book as a slave. Thorby was lucky since his last official master (""Pop"" Baslim) treated him as his adopted son and educated him accordingly. His education served him well in the 3 other societies he encounters after ""Pop"" dies. Heinlein expresses some interesting ideas on freedom in this book in a fairly subtle way."
3,More done to than doing,"Sorry I can't agree with the enthusiastic reviews of ""Citizen of the Galaxy."" The protagonist, Thorby, is altogether too much of a ""passive hero"": he never actually seems to _do_ anything, he just bounces around the galaxy like a pinball. If the story goes anywhere at all, it's because others do things to him or for him.After the story first appeared, as a serial in Astounding Science Fiction, editor John W. Campbell admitted that, in hindsight, he considered the characterization a major flaw and wished he had discussed it with the author.Of course, if you're a Heinlein fan, you should definitely add ""Citizen of the Galaxy"" to your collection. Even if Heinlein's writing is uneven, his strong point is in developing fascinating ideas and situations."
5,"Moieties, Pirates and Begging, Oh My!","One has to read Citizen of the Galaxy to understand the development of Heinlein's cultural themes and of his fascination with various forms of kinship and marriage as well as other aspects of social structure. Your first clue is that the anthropologist aboard the Sisu is named Margaret Mader.Heinlein also takes on slavery in this book. And white collar crime. Plus there is a rapscallionesque lawyer who describes himself as ""middlin honest"". Coupled with a charming protagonist, ethical mentors and the Space Navy, all the elements of a great Heinlein adventure come together in Citizen of the Galaxy.""Good Business""."
5,"A Touching, Fast-Paced Read","Except for asomewhat slow middle section, this is an extremely fast-paced read and more emotional than perhaps any other Heinlein work. It's a touching story that will stay with you for a while. This is in contrast to much of Heinlein's work, which is often called preachy and heavy-handed. It is top-notch stuff: invigorating, touching, fast-paced, thought-provoking, and memorable. I recommend it to both youths and adults."
5,This is a very good book,"This book is one of those books that gets you thinking. The first time I heard it, my father read it too me, and I think that that really made a lasting impression on me. This is a realy father-son story, and everyone should read it. If you don't like it, that's not my problem, but I sincerely hope you don't live near me."
5,"The novel gets a 5, Pocket Books' latest edition of it gets a 1","I love Heinlein's juvenile books (I call them his juvies). This is one of my top three favorites (along with ""Podkayne of Mars"" and ""Tunnel in the Sky""). When I saw the larger paperback recently I was very excited, till I read into it a few pages. This edition has not only horrible typographic errors, but whole paragraphs are placed where they do not belong. If you are reading this for the first time, I would suggest you find an older edition on Amazon, via an independent seller. I've been reading this book for many years, since a young teen, and I don't recall ever seeing a single typo let alone one in almost every paragraph. I'm a grammar and spelling geek, I notice these things. The story itself is wonderful and well thought-out, moves along quickly and has some great surprises toward the end."
3,Enjoyable but Heavy-Handed,"Although less straightforwardly political as Starship Troopers, still Heinlein insinuates his ideology into every page. As his view is not one I take in many instances, his over-the-top rhetoric can get tiresome quickly.That being said, the book was a quick, fun read, and certainly transported me away from upstate New York for a little while. The author research and thoroughness shine throughout the novel, and his extrapolations (i.e. the Sargonese from Sanskrit transformation) are simply wonderful.One other complaint, however, Heinlein tries to do too much in such a short book. It's almost as if they are 3 novels in 1; which is fine for anthologies, but a little difficult to swallow in this setting.Overall, it was fun, but I doubt I'll re-read it."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Mentor improvement.A young boy is bought as a slave by a beggar, who is your eccentric old bloke type.Here here is taught a few things as Heinlein decides to take a look at the hard work will get you anywhere story versus the not much I can do because of where I am stuck situation, as the boy grows up and gets out of the slave life to move to a trader society.3.5 out of 5"
1,Unreadable prose,"I was very disappointed with this novel; my first foray into Heinlein. Heinlein's prose in Citizen of the Galaxy is atrocious. Massive uses of semicolons; just like I am doing in this review. Very annoying; I had to stop on page 55; also lots and lots of cliches; and the dialogue is sophomoric and clumsy, for someone used to reading Malamud and Updike. (For comparison purposes, though:Asimov's fiction prose: I like; Alan Edward Nourse's fiction prose for both juveniles and adults: I love)I am currently reading and immensely enjoying Grumbles from the Grave; so I know that Heinlein can write well.I will now try my hand at Starship Troopers; which according to Grumbles, Heinlein considered an adult novel in the guise of a juvenile fiction."
1,Not Nearly as Good as Heinlein's Others,"I'm a HUGE fan of Heinlein. Despite my love for the author's writing, this book was not anything special. There are SO many clichés that made me cringe and say ""Oh, GOD... I can't believe he's writing THAT!"" that it makes the book difficult to take seriously. He covers many, many topics in much, much better ways in his other books.If you're into Heinlein (or not), choose another book."
1,Raise a Citizen!,"If you have Kids or Grandkids, who think about politics & like ""SF""; give them this book!It was One of the many Heinlein Works that helped ME grow up.It is the BEST & MOST IMPORTANT of his ""for KIDS novels"".I ment to give it 5 Stars!!!!!"
2,Not designed to be serviced,"I own two of these units. The units work fine and they are high quality devices (software issues aside).As with any UPS device, the wet-cell batteries wear out. That's usually not a big deal - you can buy replacement batteries (this unit takes two) for about $16. However, this unit is poorly designed and it is difficult to replace the batteries. It's doable, but if you compare the ease of replacement to an equivalent APC unit or OptiUPS unit you won't buy one of these. I also own 2 OptiUPS units and an APC unit and they are very servicable. I would recommend going with either of those."
4,Addonizio's fiction collection is good,"Kim Addonizio is known for her poetry, which is raw in emotion, sensual, and sexual. This collection of 22 stories, her first collection, very much fits in her literary world. None of the stories are very long, in fact a few would be termed 'flash-fiction', but all are well-written and deal with sex to some degree or another, though none are graphic enough to call these stories pornographic. The stories that stick out the most are those that deal with troubled women and their self-destructiveness (which I suppose is just about every story). But before you assume that all is grim, there are stories (such as ""A Brief History of Condoms"") that successfully use humor. Might even make you laugh out loud. I am a huge fan of Addonizio's poetry, so it makes me happy to say that as a fiction writer she is pretty good. I look forward to reading more stories (and novels if she chooses to write them) from her."
5,SF at his best,"This is the first Clarke's book I've ever read,but I'm sure that I will read all the other ones because I've found the most pregnant example of what SF should be.Great,involving,absolutely to read"
2,Boring,Perhaps it's because I never did care much for sci-fi but I found this book rather confusing and boring. I gave up reading this about one-quarter into the book as I felt the plot took much too long to unfold and it barely retained my interest. Perhaps it might appeal to sci-fi lovers... I'm not too sure...
1,Why Does Everyone Love this Book??,"I must say I was excited to read this book seeing all the awards and praise it has received. However, I found this to be the most boring, uneventful book I have read in years. I kept thinking it HAS to get better, something HAS to happen, but it just doesn't... It's like a 300 page description of paint drying - only ""in threes."" Even the ending was basically another big non-event. NOTHING!! I can't possibly recommend this book. The premise was great, and offered limitless possibilities. Unfortunately, NOTHING happens... Very sorry to have wasted my time with this book. I don't understand why it is so highly praised...."
4,Read either this one or the other three,"While I love this book on its own, I don't like it as part of the supposedly four-book series (Rendevous with Rama, Rama II, Garden of Rama, Rama Revealed). This one has almost nothing to do with the next three -- they are their own trilogy.Personally, after reading them all one time, from that point on I have only re-read the last three. I don't like this one as much as the trilogy, might be the characters or simply the wider subject area.IMHO, If you are looking for a quick, hard core sf read, try this one on its own and ignore the sequels for the moment. If you want to read hard core sf for the long haul (three large books), read only the sequel trilogy -- they stand on their own just fine."
3,"Awesome for 1970s, but not that great today","PROS: Original concept, eye opening ideas, and clear writing. The ending is outstanding.CONS: I'm sure the pace of the novel was exciting and swift for the 1970s, but today it feels sluggish and slow. I found myself skimming parts in anticipation of the point of the scene.CONCLUSION: This book won the Hugo and the Nebula award for good reason. For its time, it was the best scifi book around. Today it's still a good read, but there are more entertaining books out there."
4,The Aliens are out there...,This is a great book ! Clark builds up the excitement from the start to the end and it's hard to stop reading until the book is finnished. Read it !
5,Explore a new world!,"If you want to read a science fiction book that could fire up your imagination and make you BECOME one of the main characters, then this IS the book.Thank you Mr. Clarke for this gem!"
2,The slightly unimpressive start of a reborn series.,"RAMA was not as impressive as some of Clarke's other works. Yet, it has been used as the basis for another series of sequels. I wonder if this is all the Clarke can write anymore.The world in space, like Ringworld by Niven and another dozen different writers has become almost a sub-genre within Science Fiction.RAMA is not the best examples of this sub-genre, although it may be one of the first,"
2,Overrated,I can't seem to figure out how this book won a Hugo award. It's boring and has little complexity. Personally I think Arthur C. Clarke is overrated. Not much character development in this book and surely not a satisfying ending. I guess you have to read the sequels to actually appreciate this one.
2,Not the classic I hoped for,"When I first decided to read Rendezvous with Rama, I anticipated a classic science fiction novel that I would enjoy. Instead I eagerly flipped page after page to find out in the end I was very dissapointed with the book. This book offers plenty of questions and never gives any answers which left me wondering why I bothered reading it. If your looking for a great science fictions novel, Rendezvous with Rama is not it."
2,I think I actually fell asleep while reading this book,"There really are not a whole lot of good things I can say about this book. ""Rendezvous With Rama"" does have a good premise for a plot, but the flat and uninspiring writing makes this book a struggle to read. The characters are rather two dimensional, and not once during the entire story could I bring myself to care about what happened to any of the characters. I've heard a lot of praise for books written by Arthur C. Clarke, so I tried to like ""Rendezvous With Rama"". Unfortunately, I really cannot recommend this book to anyone, and I'm not sure if I would even pick up another book by this author."
4,Entertaining in a weird fashion,"This book was really weird for me. I kept on waiting for something to happen, some alien to jump out and say : ""Surprise!"" but no... nothing. I still enjoyed turning and reading every page and therefore, it gets a four star rating."
3,Compelling let down,"I was gripped from page 1 of this book, but the time i got to the end, i was shaking it, hoping more pages would fall out as the ending is such a let down. I know it's a series of books, but the ending to this book is so wholly unsatisfying that I feel like I'm buying into a marketing ploy if I buy the next book. So I'll pass. Hope it turns out all dandy for whomever is controlling Rama! Childhood's End is a much better Clarke book."
2,Falls short of its promise,"While I did eventually read the entire book, it took me a long while to get to the end. The story itself was a good premise, but I found that the writing was rather dull and uninspiring. The story of mankind's first encounter with extra-terrestrials should be an exciting and gripping story. Unfortunately... this book falls short of that. `Rendezvous With Rama' does start with some promise, but it ends with a barely audible whimper. I wish there was something positive I could say about this book, but to be honest, I cannot think of any positive points. Many people seem to like Arthur C. Clarke's writing, but based on this book, I doubt if I will pick up another one of his books."
3,Still Good,"If you enjoy Arthur C. Clarke's style of writng, then this is another interesting book. But compared against contemporary sci-fi, it is slow and lean."
2,Narration,I remember buying this audio-book many years ago. I loved it because the narrator sounded so energetic that you could close your eyes and actually be there with the crew exploring Rama. The narrator of this audio-book drones along in a monotone voice.I am disappointed.
4,A Decent Read,"Just finished this book. I liked it, its a small read, doesn't seem very long, so no great time investment.For the length it certainly brings up a lot of ideas, and will make you think.There's a lot of mystery in it, and a real sense of wanting to know more. I think this book will probably play on my mind a lot over the next few years. As far as it goes, I don't find the concept of an 'Ark' somewhere out in space hard to believe, and could easily imagine, something similiar happening.For its age it doesn't seem overly dated, but there's the odd minor thing to do with character, but very minor.I definitly recomend this book. Its a quick read so you've got nothing to lose, its entertaining and it does open your mind.I think the old fella died in the last couple of days. Its the only book by him that I've read, I doubt in would be the last.Cheers"
4,One of his best...,"This novel, along with 2001 and Childhood's End, forms the best of Arthur's work. A derelict alien spaceship enters the solar system and only one spacecraft is in close-enough range to investigate. They get inside, but that is just the beginning of the mystery. What I love about this book is the realistic way in which Clarke describes a solar system that has been heavily colonized by humans. It is scientifically plausible and he doesn't try to fudge over little problems like gravity and the speed of light.There is currently an all-CGI movie version of this in developement by David Fincher. I look forward to seeing it, but one would do well to read the book first."
3,Average from Arthur C.,"I cannot tell a lie, Rendezvous with Rama disappointed me somewhat after reading many of it's fabulous reviews on this web site. I have read 2001 A Space Odyssey (see my review) and rank it as one of my all time favourite books of the Sci Fi genre. Perhaps I was expecting too much with the books exellent reviews and the authors fine reputation.So what's wrong with the book? Nothing really, it's just not a very exciting story, and the characters are rather bland and under developed. There is an air of mystery, as we find out more and more about the purpose of the object they call Rama but not enough to excite.The book hangs purposefully for a sequel, but I don't think I want to find out any more really.My advice, read 2001, and if you really like that then give Rama a go. If you only thought 2001 was average, then you will not enjoy this book."
5,Great Introduction,I loved this story. I am only 13 though so didn't understand some of the scientific bits and probably didn't catch all the ideas in the book. I loved the main idea of the book though. Really liked the last sentence! Read the sequels they are even better!
3,Less Impressive Now,"I liked the story especially taking the publishing date into account, but Clarke's writing is clunky and contrived. All his characters are boy/girl scouts and it creates an unreal quality that should be avoided at all costs when trying to get someone to buy into a scifi story line. It's a good read if you like that sort of thing and haven't read too many ""mysterious alien spaceship that's really a self-contained world"" books. The physics is not really all that interesting anymore."
5,A must read. RAMA has it all.,"Rendezvous With Rama is a colossus of Science Fiction, by The Colossus of Science Fiction. Science, both technical and social, is demonstrated to a degree that will inevitably draw you into this elaborate and intriguing story. Every aspect of the book seems to have been honed to perfection. You constantly find yourself looking back and saying, ""Yeah, that does seem like the logical way that would happen...why didn't I see that?"" It's all here. The plot is engrossing, the technical details about a very real future are fascinating, and the characters are as real as those you would read about in the paper or see on the evening news. Clarke writes a ""dry"" style, as some say, but that's what life is like: you never actually see the whole picture. Rama is a wonderful book, written in an irresistable style, that no reader should overlook. And you won't be reading a book for long...it becomes all too real."
4,Small faults don't detract from delicious imaginings,"All the wonderful things said about this book are true. The concept itself is fabulous, the images are breathtaking, the end is a cliff-hanger. However, I find it strange that Mr. Clarke's imagination was very limited and traditional when it came to certain aspects of technology and to gender-roles. Example: one hundred years in the future, in a time of exploding population, an astronaut can be found eating ""concentrated meat"" and one man may have more than one wife though nothing is said about polyandry. Also, the surveying and telecommunications technology seemed to be not as sophisticated as one might imagine will develop in the next 100 years. It felt like it was set 25 years in the future instead. But, aside from these small lapses, the author's imagination seems to be in fine form and I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series."
4,Great book! Can't wait to check out the rest of the series.,"I bought this book at the airport to pass the time on a business trip. It's been a long time since I've been wrapped up in a novel, but this one did it. I had difficulty putting it down because of Clarke's fascinating plot and flowing writing style. That doesn't mean, however, that this is a perfect book; some absurd coincidences and too many unexplained points left me with a ""cheated feeling"" (you know, the feeling you get after reading a Michael Crichton book, ha ha). In any case, I would recommend this to anyone looking for fun, enjoyable sci-fi. I'll agree with a previous reveiwer... it definitely makes a statement about humanity's place in the universe. I'm hoping the rest of the series won't let me down."
4,A favorite,"One of my favorite novels, however the rest of the series peters out. This book gives the potential for a great series, but it just doesn't happen. A worthy read though in itself."
4,A great start to the RAMA series.,By the time I started reading this book the full Rama series was out and I have heard a lot of good reviews about all four books. So my expectations were fairly high and this book didn't disappoint. Sir Clarke showed great imagination throughout this book and never let the reader fall behind even at the break-neck speed of the story. I simply loved it and would recommend this to any sci-fi reader.
5,Nice Series and would like to read again BUT!!!,"I have the Rama series in hard and paperback so I could read at work without damaging my hardcover copies. I would like to read the series again on my Kindle, but do not understand why the first book has not been converted for the Kindle, and why the price of $9.00 for the succeeding books in the series. I have spent money for the books I have and hope that the first will be converted for the Kindle and the price will dramatically come down."
3,Great Details But Left Me Unsatisfied,"I wanted to like this more than I did. It's revered as a classic, and I purposefully sought it out after reading all the glowing reviews for it. It's very imaginative and the world building on the spacecraft Rama is astounding. But it left me feeling a little flat... we go through all of the exploration and discovery of an object that's entered the Earth's solar system only to have it leave again in short order. I'm guessing that the idea of other beings, of having other life confirmed and being exposed to that confirmation is supposed to be enough, and maybe 40 years ago, when it was first published, throwing the idea out there was enough. But for me, it wasn't. I felt like there was all this buildup and then... nothing. Perhaps this was intended to whet my appetite for the sequel, but I think I'll pass."
4,A Classic Tale of Wonder,"This is one of the classics I missed when I was younger. I definitely enjoyed it, and this story is far more compelling than his 2001 book.I must say though that I much preferred Greg Bear's ""Eon"" which is a similar story, but with many more interesting arcs and possibilities.Eon"
5,Fiction without suspending disbelief,I am a sucker for hard science and frivolous space antics and while I am really late to the party I still felt a childish sense of excitement when I read this.That being said this is not a frivolous book. The sense of realism and detail really caught my attention. Mr. Clarke went all out with hard facts without taking anything away from an enjoyable read. If anything the ability to immerse myself without needing to suspend reality made me enjoy it so much more.There is no need to tread on all the other reviews here so I will just say that this is a must read if for no other reason than the realization of how small and insignificant we really are.
3,"Interesting premise, but only an average novel","The idea for this book is very original and teeming with potential. However, Clarke ultimately fails to deliver all that this book could have been. The characters are rather flat and there is not much at all in the way of plot until near the end. This book relies on the grandiose descriptions of Rama as its bread and butter. While these descriptions are good in and of themselves, they just aren't enough to form a masterpiece. I give Clarke credit for an incredibly creative idea here, but the book isn't strong enough in other areas for me to recommend it. If you're curious to read Clarke, I would point you to ""Childhood's End"" instead."
3,Definitely not one of Arthur's best work.,"I read 2001: Space Odyssey and Childhood's End and what attracted me to Arthur C. Clarke style was the brilliant and amazing descriptions of space and the psychology of the human mind. In most of his descriptions he indulges on detail and his delivery is poetic to the last word. I did not find myself in sense of wonder or awe like I expected in Rendezvous with Rama. Much like in 2010: Odyssey Two, he creates a crew of astronomers that represent every social condition of the human mind that exists in a non-clever way and uses dialogue that makes the character two-dimensional and unbelievable. This book is slow-paced and if you are a reader that is looking for mind-blowing science fiction with a new outlook on the beauty that is our universe, you will not find it here."
5,An excellent sci-fi novel,"Rendezvous with Rama is a hard sci-fi novel that all devotees of the genre must read. The setting is intricate and amazing, the characters believable, and the plot mysterious. The ending is perfect, and I truly wish Clarke had left well-enough alone instead of writing a sequel to this excellent book."
4,a good beginning to a great series,I really enjoyed rendevous with Rama but it was a little dry.I didn't realise this until I read the other 3 books with mr Lee adding a more human touch.Clark is one of the best sci fi writers ever and he is also very smart.He would not have allowed Mr Lee a chance to co-write unless he knew he could contribute something that was lacking in his writing ie human relations.They both blended well together to produce my third favorite readings of all time(the other two being lord of the rings and the hornblower series).It is a blend of scifi and humaness which allowed me to believe what I was reading.
3,Arthur C. Clark--Travelogues of the Mind,"I don't know that I would classify Clark as a creator of great fiction; as mentioned in other reviews, the ""human equation"" in his works is largely missing. Clark excels and creating vivid descriptions of technology and alien grandeur, but his books are a bit lifeless at they have almost no character developement or interesting dialog.I've read most of his books, and find he is a great alternative in those times I would find myself reaching for an atlas or a National Geographic. Honestly, I think AC Clarke is one of those sacred cow authors--praised by those who think it raises their intellectual profile, and read mainly when bored by those who can see that the emperor, while not entirely naked, could do with more than a loincloth."
3,Interesting idea but boring writing,The ideas in this book seemed interesting enough but it was tough to read through because it was incredibly boring. I am glad I read it but couldn't put myself through that again.
5,What science fiction *can* be,"Some readers tend to dismiss science fiction novels either as comic books or as pretentious nerdy drivel. ""Rendezvous With Rama"" is the perfect antidote for anyone who thinks that *all* SF is either lightweight or impenetrable. Without compromising the science involved, Clarke presents a lucid and readable story that almost anyone would find compelling. The feelings of wonder and discovery are strong throughout the novel; one often has the sense of joining in the exploration along with the book's characters.Clarke frequently had problems with endings, but the closure reached at the end of ""Rendezvous"" is quite satisfying -- even though many questions remain deliberately unanswered. Unfortunately, the book's celebrated final line opened the door for some appalling sequels, written largely by Gentry Lee. These later travesties are suitable only for incorrigible fans of soap operas."
