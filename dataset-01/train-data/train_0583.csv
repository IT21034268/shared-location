1,How many VT students are buying this book?,"John Lott is a first class wack job. His research is questionable and he even invented a person (a woman named Mary Rosh) to defend him on various websites and blogs. How sad is that?Hey John, FYI guns kill innocent people."
5,Very good book alot of good info.,Very good book alot of good information. It falls in line with many other staticis I've read. It is also a good read for the anti gun person but then they might have to admit they have been wrong.
1,Garbage,"If John Lott was a student in a basic graduate statistics class, he would have failed with this research.If you have any knowledge of research methods and statistically sampling, you know this research is a farce.John Lott went online pretending to be a woman to support his research, so the only thing he proved was that the Internet transgender lifestyle reduces the crime rate.Read ""Nine Crazy Ideas in Science"" if you read this book and do not have a true knowledge of statistics."
1,An empirical caution,"While this topic is difficult to teach, and the rhetoric often deteriorates to amazingly low levels in public discussions, it is an important one. I want to alert people to another Univ of Chicago Law & Econ prof (Duggan) whose research on guns and crimes is just being published. His analysis comes to the opposite conclusion from Lott. Duggan not only analyses the data in a more fair and comprehensive way, but he also shows how Lott's methodological individualism leads Lott to several untenable but crucial assumptions."
1,Filled with NRA poppycock,"How sad that in this day and age that a book filled with so many skewed and twisted statistics could get such acclaim. Structured around a framework of tired old NRA arguments - which basically advocate the more guns the merrier - this book is poorly written, boring and factually wrong."
5,Very intellegent review of America's dilema with hand guns,Mr. Lott does a wonderful job of breaking down the causes of violence and then with numerical data and common sense he shows how right to carry laws help to reduce violent crime. This book is a must for thoose who want to understand the pro gun argument through the words of a college proffessor.
5,Lott's chapter on the political and academic debate,The dustjacket endorsements quoted above were right on the mark. A healthy society must discredit and dishonor unscrupulous political activists such as those Lott exposes -- all the moreso the academic professionals and (supposedly objective) newsmedia who use rhetorical slight-of-hand to deceive the public.
4,The Facts strike nerve with Pro-Gun Control misinformation.,Finally we get a thorough non-emotional study based on true statistics that force the left to realize their lies can be successfully challenged. Great in depth analysis on true stats not made up ones. This study struck a nerve that the left hasn't been challenged to realize...law abiding citizens can make a difference and the study proves it. I encourage everyone to learn from this study and standup to the pro-gun control propaganda.
2,Yawn,There are 5 women featured. None totally shaved. The bulk of this was filmed outside which is it's downfall because a lot of what you're looking at is in the shade or in the shadow because the sun is behind them. Lighting very poor. Not enough close ups. I thought the best part was the shower scenes in the end. If I had paid full price for this one I'd be really upset. I ended up fast forwarding through much of it.
2,"Nude Aerobics, Vol. 2","Pretty disappointing. The video lets you watch five women undress, do some simple exercises, bat a ball around standing waist-deep in a pool, and then shower. The women are a nice variety and pretty enough, but you can't see many details. The video is shot outdoors in bright sunlight, so much of the time the womens's bodies are in shadows or glare. The women look bored or like they're waiting for instructions from the director. The cameraman wanders aimlessly over the women's bodies without a clue how to make them look sexy. Don't bother if you're looking for an exercise video or a voyeur video."
1,Do NOT buy this.,Hydroquinone is a dangerous chemical that can potentially lead to cancer. Instead buy the other Mela-D Dark Spot with Kojac Acid which is more natural. I wonder why Amazon still sell this stuff here.
3,"Not "" Made in France""",This lotion is made in the USA and the texture and smell is completely different from the French version. It is thick and smells like sunscreen lotion.
5,charm,The charm was just as shown in the picture. It arrived in a little over a week's time and is nice.I would order from this company again.
4,BACKSTAGE,"Agatha Christie wrote THEY DO IT WITH MIRRORS in 1950 and published it in 1952. This Mrs. Marple mystery is really interesting for several reasons. First of all, Mrs. Marple is present on the crime scene when the murder is committed. In order to solve the case and use her brain, she'll have to forget what her eyes and her ears have seen or heard at the moment of the murder. Secondly, one must not forget that, at that time, Agatha Christie was very busy with the stage adaptation of some of her novels and that she had to become familiar with the peculiar theatrical world and its limitations and tricks. With THEY DO IT WITH MIRRORS, she teaches us a brilliant lesson of mise en sc√®ne and some of her thoughts about illusion and theater are totally relevant. Highly recommended.A book to keep in your library."
3,Size does matter!,"The decal really measures 5.5"" x 5.5"". The quality seems great, but doesn't fit the place where I was going to apply it :( Please correct your item description."
5,Fond Memories with Jack Benny,"I grew up watching (and sometimes listening) to the great comedians back in the early 60s up to the early 70s; Jack Benny, Bob Hope, Red Skelton, etc. It was good clean and very funny. I really miss these greats. So I enjoyed watching Jack Benny and would recommend it to anyone."
2,This is a sheep book with some goat info added,"If you are considering this book only for the goat information, save your money and look for a different one. I purchased this book for the goat information and I found that 2/3 of the book is about sheep and the rest is old, obsolete information related to goats....especially meat goats. This book has not come up to speed related to the major changes that have happened over the last 6-7 years and some of their statistics are from 1994. The majority of the goat section covers dairy goats, angora and cashmere goats. The major part of the meat goat information concerns the spanish goats. Sixth edition must mean they have published the goat information six times...not updated it for the sixth time."
4,Superb!,"This is where the perfect metal band began. Some of the most amazing complex music I've heard in a long time. Jon and Randy's trademark rythym guitar riffs are legendary on this album. It was also the very first official Iced Earth album. Jon has said that this album was recored in a big hurry. I dont see why he said that. The timing on this album is very superb. The greatest song from them, ""Iced Earth"", is on this, so it's a good metal album.The reason i gave it 4 out of 5 is of course, the singing. Ugh. a bad King Diamond impresion. The singer can barely sing, and when he does, it's not that good. Espiecially on the 1st and last track. But, besides that, it's a great album. GET IT!"
3,Where did they find this singer?,"This is the beginning of my all-time favorite Power Metal band, Iced Earth. If I was judging the album based on music alone, it would have received five stars, but I can't do that... when Gene Adam ruins it with his TERRIBLE voice. He was the first of Iced Earth's four vocalists, and he's probably one of the worst I have ever heard. Thank God Matt Barlow re-recorded these songs with the band on ""Days of Purgatory"".Now, on to the many positive points. The music here is absolutely incredible. Mixing the best of Metallica and Iron Maiden to create something new, Iced Earth became a driving force for ""true"" Metal in the early 90's. Even with the terrible singer, IE managed to record a classic. It's really sad to hear ""When The Night Falls"" here, because Matt Barlow's version is the way it should have been done in the first place. I'm glad they were smart and got rid of this guy... but I wonder why they hired him in the first place....."
4,The Beginning,"This is where the dark saga of the band previously known as Purgatory began. Iced Earth puts out some great songs on this album despite the bad vocals of Gene Adams and bad production (not as bad as Killing's my Business, but still...) I mean come on. Which guy told Gene Adams he could sing? Ugh. Anyway, true classics of metal are put out on this record. The namesake track, Colors, Life and Death, Funeral, and When The Night Falls are my favorite tracks. When the Night Falls is my favorite Iced Earth song by far and away, probably tied with Melancholy. For die hard Iced Earth fans,you already own this so why should I tell you to get it? For fans looking to get interested in the band, I recommend Dark Saga or Something Wicked before this one."
4,A great start for Iced Earth,"It is remarkable how good this album is for a debut. It sounds as if the writing had already been honed and most the rough edges removed. I highly recommend this for fans of the band. This album is home to Gene Adam, the only time he would sing for Iced Earth. I can't imagine this album without him or any other way. Highlights include ""When the Night Falls"", ""Written on the Walls"", and the beautiful interlude ""Solitude"" which leads into the instrumental ""The Funeral"". However there truly is not one bad song on here. If you have already made your way through ""Night of the Stormrider"" and ""Burnt Offerings"", then this should be your next stop."
5,just buy it already!,This cd is one of my favs from iced earth! Yes i know it's not barlow or Ripper but its just as good. I don't know why most people really don't like his voice. i think it's cool! when i first heard the original version i honestly thought it was a young barlow. He sounds younger and more reckless which i think is a very cool sound for that time. but yea whatever.. love it or hate it.. just give it a try with an open mind you'll see how awesome it is.
2,came unuseable,"The two stationary cutters were so mis-ground that a sheet of 26 gauge couldn't even enter the cut. I'm a tool maker by trade so I took it apart, re-machined the cutters and now it works like a charm. The external finishing is immaculate, that gets a 5. I'd say buying one is a krap-shoot because their quality control is whats wrong, not the separate parts necessarily. Six months ago I bought their nibbler, took it apart before running it and sure was glad I did - the little gear box was crammed with machining filings that some careless assembly person hadn't bothered to remove -it would have self-destructed in minutes. I'd say if you by one take it all apart and examine it first before running it."
1,Broke after 3 uses.,"Used this product 3-4 times on thin sheet metal, then something internally broke. Overall, we used it for less than 15 minutes total before it broke. Junk."
3,A bit heavy on the plotting,"There is just too much plotting and scheming going on in this one for me. I found the first half of the story somewhat overdone with the Tlotoxl's plans to kill the Doctor's party. The fixation on the Aztecs practice of human sacrifice was a bit over done as well.The Doctor and his companions (Barbara, Ian and his grand daughter Susan) find themselves in an Aztec temple in the early 1500's, a few years prior to Cortez's arrival. Led by Barbara but opposed by the Doctor (who maintains history cannot be altered), they set off on a campaign to change history and stop the Aztec practice of human sacrifice. The story improves in the second half, but not enough to keep this as one of the lesser stories in the novelizations of the Doctor Who franchise."
4,The Dream,"While Genny Austin recovers from the trauma of seeing her husband murdered outside their Santa Barbara condo, she experiences recurring nightmares with strange, primitive undertones. Symbolic meaning and past life regression lead Genny to sleep specialists and doctors. When a drunken gang attempts to rape her, Jack Brennan steps in like a guardian angel to prevent this violation. He still grieves for his wife and can relate to Genny's pain. As this complicated story progresses, the dreams persist whenever sleep overtakes her. Digressions into frightening past centuries bring back memories that convince Genny of her own reincarnation. An excellent book for lovers of the paranormal genre and another talented, well-executed delivery by Martin."
3,Do dreams come true?,"Genny's husband was murdered in front of her house. She may have witnessed it but you're not sure. She finds his lifeless body and the nightmares begin. After two years of nightly nightmares, she's exhausted. Soon the dreams start to invade her wakeful state. Are they just dreams related to her husband's murder or are they dreams from a past life. While having another wakeful night, Genny goes for a walk on the beach where three thugs attack her. She is saved by a womanizer named Jack. What attracts them to each other is anyone's guess. Together they try to sort out her dreams and fight their building attraction. They are complete opposites but still they pursue each other. The book takes a while to develop into good reading. Too much dead time, the book starts to take off about 20 pages before it ends."
2,This book was hard to get into,By the middle of the book I was interested but I thought it dragged on for awhile. It wasn't a book that will stick out in my mind as a good read. Most of the book was boring.
3,THE DREAM,"GENNY IS HAVING BAD DREAMS AND BECOMES ROMANTICALLY INVOLVED WITH JACK, WHO SAVES HER ONE NIGHT. I REALLY WANTED TO GIVE THIS BOOK 4 STARS AS THE PLOT OF THE BOOK IS ACTUALLY GREAT AND MAKES FOR A REALLY GREAT READ. THE PROBLEM WITH THE BOOK IS THAT GENNY IS A SAP. SHE REALLY HAS NO BACKBONE AND SHE COMES OFF MORE LIKE A MINDLESS VICTIM THAN ANYTHING ELSE. JACK IS GREAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIS BETRAYAL OF HER BECAUSE HE CAN'T DEAL WITH HIS FEELINGS FOR GENNY. I THOUGHT IT WAS WEIRD THAT HIS FRIEND CHARLEY DOES MORE FOR GENNY THAN JACK DOES. THE BOOK STARTS OFF REALLY SLOW, BUT 1/3 OF THE WAY INTO IT IT PICKS UP MOMENTUM AND OTHER THAN THE THE REDUNDANCE OF JACK NOT BEING ABLE TO DEAL WITH HIS FEELINGS, IT IS A VERY GOOD BOOK."
2,"Unit makes loud popping noise, then sound goes out","I also purchased this system, and have experienced the same problem the fellow from Kentucky did; only I still had a picture after the sound went out. I have not yet spoken to Panasonic about this. I would like to find out how the guy from Kentucky knew this was a known problem. It did not do that until after a couple of months after we purchased the unit. Had I known this, I would not have purchased this model."
3,Low Price but not the best,"bad: gets overheated when, and you can hear pops in the speakers(it happened only with MP3 in my case)progressive scan may not be working in my case.can adjust seating position(it wont work)good: cant find a similar stuff for this price.sound is good, looks fabolous.....i may return it(just 3 weeks old)....since the overheating may become a big problem in the long run..."
1,Known problem with this unit!!,"Don't buy this unit. There is a problem with it over heating and causing a loud poping sound after a couple hours of use. I talked with Panasonic about this and they will not admit to the problem, however, you can find several other people that have had the same problem on the net.When asked for replacement unit, I was told that I would have to take it to my local repair center to have a tech look at the unit. This unit is still under warrenty and it is going to take several days for the unit to be repaired. No sound or DVD while this takes place. I will never buy another Panasonic unit again, to bad because this was the best unit I found on the market. Guess next time I'll pay the extra money and get a Sony! At least they care about their customers."
3,Bad subwoofer,"""I will be tackling Panasonic's SC-HT900 700 Watt home theatre system today. It's a luxurious looking package with 4 slim tallboy speakers accompanied by a center speaker, the SC-HT900 looks tall and slim. The subwoofer comes with a built-in 220 watt power amplifier and holds the same slim and tall characteristics. It seems that Panasonic has made this home theatre system look like those fashion models with too much makeup and too much height. The only difference I see between them....the HT900 is metallic silver and butt naked!...full review @ Bytesector..."
2,Good sound - Poor quality,"Good sound, easy to install and use. However it does have a build defect. After prolonged use it may overheat. As a result you will hear a very loud popping through speakers or system will shut down. Panasonic will not discuss defect, however my local Panasonic service center did comment they had seen a number of these returned for repair. There is also mention of individuals experiencing this issue on eCoustics.com. My service centers quote a 7 - 15 day wait to even look at the product, then additional time to fix. So I would look for a different product."
3,Decent system,"I bought this unit from Amazon about 6 months ago. I must admit, this is a very stylish system with very low profile. The dvd player itself is very very slim. It is wider than normal components though.Sound is pretty decent. I have not had any problem with the sound. Some folks have complained about the subwoofer being weak. But in my setup it is delivering robust and rich bass. I think this unit is not meant to be in a very big room. In small rooms sound is great.The remote feels flimsy. I am scared one day may 20 months old daughter is going to break it and my system will be unusable. Sometimes the buttons need to be pressed hard. And since there is no indicator LED on the remote, you can't tell if the button got pressed or not. Little annoying.It does not play dvd-rw or dvd+rw. I think this day and age all dvd players need to handle the above formats."
1,Jaw dropping popping sounds,Do not buy this system. Last night I heard extremely loud popping sounds coming out of the speakers while watching TV. I actually thought the speakers were going to explode.
1,Buyers beware!,"This CD is not at all what it appears to be. They got other people singing and playing the music, so it's not what you're probably looking for. Terrible misrespresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I used my other party cd's or my guests would have left......and I would have held the door open.....not blamed them for leaving!!"
1,Not the original artists!!,"After eagerly inserting the CDs into my player, what came out was not what I expected. The ""various"" artists were not the original ""various"" artists. I guess the joke's on me."
1,Don't buy it.,It's samples that you listen to are not the original recordings/artists. All new digital masters. Save your money. You will not like it and this will not be what you'll be expecting for those who support any albums of original recordings or artists. I mean SERIOUSLY!!!
1,Awful Fake,"I agree with other reviewers. Don't waste your money. I should have listened to the samples. To hear more awful fakes, visit the producer's web site at drewsfamous.com. Listen to their selection of garbage before you make the purchase."
1,please read the reviews before you buy anything...ever.,"After a long night of intoxication I wound up buying this cd set. This is for childrens parties, meant for those who either don't know or don't careabout the original quality recordings. If your reputation or pocket book is not at stake this compelation is decent. Save your money for the real thing. Support the original artists it's worth it."
4,Definetly a Party,Loved it - all the songs were great - really puts you in the mood to party. Cd's worked great.
5,Great Collection of Party Songs,Very close reproductions to the original artist. Your guests will never know that they aren't listening to the originals because they will be too busy dancing and watching their family and freinds having a great time. This one set filled in many holes in my DJ presentation. A real value. When can I get the next Drew collection!
2,It's not great.,"This doesn't stay on too long, is kind of hard to apply, and looks funny on me. There are lots of other choices out there, so I probably won't use it again."
4,Truth is Narrow and Old-Fashioned,"I think Waldron Scott has identified, not a weakness of Hesselgrave's book, but its key strength. It is the fact that the author comes to sound conclusions about each of the ten issues that makes this book a very welcome balance to many skewed modern conclusions of these ten crucial issues. Hesselgrave's Biblical hermenuetics are very well thought out with possibly only one or two exceptions. He's extensively well-read and has a mountain of experience behind him. Strongest of all: he's committed to a Biblical basis for mission as being fundamentally the only foundation we can stand on for any argument within the world of mission.For more on how I felt about this text, check out Arukiyomi's blog at"
2,Great idea but not strong enough,My son is new to lacrosse and the second time we used this item the plastic clasp that holds the ball and teather cord broke off. This is a great item but I belive if the clasp was metal it would work better. Wouldn't recommend to a fellow lacrosse player.
1,Piece of JUNK,"We used this item ONCE and the cord broke in two places at the ball connections. And it broke in two areas that are unrepairable. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. I am a high school coach and bought this for my daughter. She is not a strong thrower and this item STILL BROKE.These types of items make me very upset. They are positioned as an aid, but they have a bad design and are poorly contructed."
3,"Not bad, but needs some improving","I bought this for my son to use since we don't have a brick wall or place for a lax wall, for him to practice against. The concept is great, however within 10 minutes it was broken where the elastic cord meets the connector to the ball. Not too bad of a fix, just remove the plastic clip and then re-tie it on. Then the other plastic clip broke a few minutes later again, had to re-clip it to the knot I tied.Bottom line, this is a great idea and one that will do well for most kids for scoops and passing, but if the manufacturer is reading this, get rid of the plastic parts!"
3,maturity,"This is the album they did before Passage, the turning point in their carriers. It is not as impressive and mature, but still a good album. If you are a hard-nosed death metal head, you'll like this one. If you think it takes a little more to make a difference, don't even mind."
2,A Kept Woman,"I have to say that this is not the book that will keep you on the hook. In fact, the plot was hardly substantial, revolving around the partnership/relationship of Michael and Diana, and how their exes plotted to destroy their reputation and what they had. This was quite a disappointment, since the acclaimed Louise Bagshawe reputation emphasized girl-power, and this book lack it much. The ending was rather abrupt and unsatisfying."
3,light read,"To start off, speaking as a woman, extreme feminists should try to give speeches where they are due, not whenever they have a chance. Frankly, this is getting really tiring, and reading one of the reviews about this book you would've thought it called for the return of the ""harem"" women or something. Back to the book, though it is not a master piece by any sense, I found it to be a lot bettr than most of the other books in this genre, which tend to have challow, undefined characters. This book's main characters were outlined very nicely. However the book does have a lot of ""hollywood stuff"" in it, so you might not want to take it all that seriously. All in all, it is a great light read, ideal for a short vacation or for flicking through at the beach."
5,Best song ever!,I love this song and so does everyone else!It when all the way to number 9 on the billboard charts!
3,"Poor packaging, Blade guard poorly designed",Received inadequately packaged by manufacturer; received with a cracked rope pull guard. Blade guard skews easily and part of it was chopped off the first time it was used. (I've had numerous brush cutters and am not new to this). On the plus side it starts easily and the harness system is tops
1,Ohh Please!!!!,"For all those robotic, non-informed, ignorants who listen to the left wing biased media, you will love this movie. For all the freedom loving true Americans who heard The Clinton's, Gore, Albright and other libs claim throughout the 90's that there were WMDs in Iraq and now hear those same people blame it all on Bush like he was the only person who made that statement, this movie is not worth 3 seconds of your day. This is the type of typical Liberal Rhetoric that has supposedly taken over the American Mainstream. Well I'm hear to tell you now, most Americans don't buy the outright Liberal Lies!"
1,"If you liked Fahrenheit, you'll like this",Predictable and one-sided. A good purchase for conservatives who don't watch CNN or MSNBC and a predictable purchase for liberals who just can't get enough criticism of Bush and don't want the other side of the story.
1,If you like lies and distorted truths you'll like this!,Only the brainwashed liberal left could watch this movie or F 9-11 and not see the glaring factual discrepancies and distorted half truths present in both films!Major journalists from both sides and the 9-11 commission itself have made a liar out of Michael Moore's assertions and the same is true for this piece of election time propaganda!Let's hope the mental midgets of the left spend their money on this film and not give it to their equally distorted candidates.
1,Complete Garbage,"War activist throwbacks to the 60s raging the same old stuff. The only mastery is the editing to take info out of context. This would do well on CBS or BBC. I actually purchased it by accident thinking it was another film on Iraq. My biggest regret is they got my $9.95. Reasonalble minded people, save your money."
1,Almost completely untrue.,"People really get their information about the Iraq war from these terrible and biased documentaries? Try READING about the war and get some real analysis. This movie is barely more legitimate than Michael Moore's thoroughly refuted, unintentional piece of fiction."
1,Propaganda,If you like to watch propaganda then watch this garbage. I can't believe that people can actually believe this nonsence that is shown in this so called documentary. Use some common sense and don't waste your money!
1,Oh Please!,"You think a dictator killing MILLIONS of OWN people isn't sufficient reason to remove him? I personally don't care if he did or didn't have WMD or ties to Al Queda or a hand in the 9/11 attacks. The fact that he invaded Kuwait in the first Gulf War was sufficient reason to remove him much less his blatant disregard for the lives of his own people, the massacring of the Kurds or his repeated noncompliance with even the peaceful attempts at reconciliation by the UN. Come on people, lets get some perspective. Saddam Hussein needed to be removed and George W. Bush and Tony Blair (who pretty much hold otherwise opposite political views) and many other world leaders recognized that and had the guts to do what was right. I personally applaud them."
2,What's up Charlie Brown?,"This was a wishy washy attempt at the truth. The facts are there in parts and pieces, but it was not really put together well. Some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic. This DVD had an agenda and is not unbiased, and I think it failed at it's overall agenda. There is more than enough information pre-9/11 and post-9/11 to put together something more worthy and accurate than this DVD has attempted to do. If this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond, we are truly in trouble. The truth is out there, and I think this DVD tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together. There were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this DVD, but this DVD is maybe worth a glance, but not a long hard look."
3,WMD or No WMD... this needed to be Done!,"I fought in Iraq the first 5-months of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM... saw first hand and heard first hand accounts of how the Hussein Regime brutalized people... enough said. UN Sanctions... bogus, useless, not effective, a joke. WMD or no-WMD... who knows, but should we have just waited around until that regime demonstrated that they ""did"" have them by using them... or killed enough people... like we did with [...]?... Saddam certainly was not on the verge of becoming the 3rd Reich, but the intent was there and the only reason he wasn't is because we canned his [...] in 1991... should have finished the job then... the job now is much tougher because we didn't."
1,ALL THE TRUTH,"IN 1998 Clinton said there were weapons of mass destruction.Terrorist are americas greatest threat. Clinton swept the first bombing OF WTC under the rug...The CIA/intelligence failed the american people numnerous times. America fights terrorist who are the true infidels. They will kill, behead, drag our bodies down streets every chance they can........Americans, many are in total denial of how serious/evil terriorst in Iraq, Iran, Syria and other countries are.It is amazing how Americans can have such different views on our greatest enemies. TERRORIST."
2,The Whole Truth is a misleading title,"This so-called documentary, may be gleefully accepted by liberals and the uninformed as a revelation of how the Bush administration falcified intelligence reports and sources in order to start a war in Iraq for fanciful reasons, but it is a one-sided presentation of statements from openly biased, critics of the Bush administration. There was no attempt to present an opposing point of view, and the poorly disguised attempts to ridicule the President (even joking about his appearance in a flight uniform on the carrier) was beneath contempt and concrete evidence that this was a hoax created to influence the November election. If you dislike President Bush, and believe the conspiracy theories about Iraq, you will love this contrived attack on the President. If you really want the truth, there are plenty of unbiased sources available."
5,I'd Forgotten all the Lies,"I first watched this brilliant movie last winter. At the conclusion of the showing there was a hush over the entire room. Then a lady said softly, ""That Son of a Bi**ch."" I was the second to comment. ""I knew everyone of these lies....but there were so many I'd forgotten half of them."" Greenwald brought them together masterfully!While no presentation could possibly document ALL of the misrepresentations, distortions, lies, and ""BIG LIE"" in one riveting hour, Greenwald made a valliant effort and the results were GREAT!I find it interesting the 2 critical reviews just lambasted the movie, without any rebuttal or critique.I assume they haven't watched Greenwald's ""OutFoxed."" They should.Greenwald did a masterful job. The on screen experts provided much needed insights.I hope Greenwald wins many wards for this fine piece of work."
5,Excellent!,"I disagree with the previous review. I thought this documentary, in a clear and oderly manner, addresses the Bush administrations (Cheney, Rice, Powell...) reasons for going to war in Iraq, while also following their subsequent change in reasoning as their previous reasons proved to be faulty. It shows how they consistently lied to the public and used weak or plainly false intelligence to make their case. There is an excellent and wide assortment of individuals interviewed including a number of C.I.A. employees/agents, weapons inspectors, weapons experts, congressman, and more. I only wish it was shot on film or HD and had a higher budget so that it could have made its way into theatres."
4,Needs a DVD,"The trainer works great. Gives my 12 year old grandson a lot of cuts that he was not getting before. I think it needs a DVD although to correct swing issues. Jeter could do a 15 minute training on how to swing, how to pick up the ball faster, etc. I think that would be a great addition to this tool."
2,Good tool but serious problem with contact piont,"The device works well, but the contact point on this unit is made out of hard plastic. Each contact makes a very loud ping. My daughter and I literally wear hearing protection when working with it. This is annoying, but my main concern is that thin-walled high performance bats could be damaged by this unit. Indeed there is a warning label on the stick that reads ""use only with practice bat."" Because different bats swing differently I would prefer a unit that could be used with the game day bat."
5,pure awesomeness,I used it for about a year. It really helped me hit and my power has gone way up I love how it comes right back.
5,Good for hand to eye coordination,"I've had it for a few days, and it went together easily, and has seemed to enthrall my 10 year old little leaguer. He is able to spend an hour or so with it improving hand to eye coordination in hitting. I tried it, and I'm too old for this, kept missing. It seems quite solid, can be moved relatively easily, and can be used inside (had it in the garage during the rain). Had a problem with one of the hand tightened clamps not moving easily, and the company (Pro performance) was very responsive in shipping out a replacement part (which was ultimately not necessary), since the WD-40 fix ultimately worked. All in all OK, let's see how it holds up over time."
5,Make a Hitter out of your Little Leaguer,"I rarely right reviews and Im not righting a review about the design or quality of the product. I am writing to say my 8 year old his hitting wonders now that he uses the hurricane. He hits ever ball first pitch now (from the couch pitched games). I put it away for 2 weeks and he started striking out. I brought it out again, and now he is smashing it again.""The proof is in the pudding"""
4,Addictive & Well built...grab one for your aspiring major league'r!,"My 6 yr old loves it! He spends 15-20 minutes at a time on the trainer. The feedback this machine gives is motivational. You strive to wrap the ball around the pole and appreciate the solid 'ting' you get when striking the target on the barrel.Heavy, well made product."
5,Excellent,"I use this product a three time a week and my swing and timing have become very good. I hitting line drives like never before and My playmates are commenting on how good I have become. This is a sturdy and durable piece of work. If you want to make your swing and timing better, buy the Hurricane trainer."
4,skeeter davis pop hits collection.,"very enjoyable 1950,s early 1960,s pop hit collection. its got cant stay mad at you, end of the world, gonna get along with out you know now. she did a good job on cover songs, such as i will follow him. of her last songson the cd. i liked a summer song. light and breezy, very sixtys. made you think you were out for a walk on a very beautiful day."
4,Swedish Instruction Only,"Complete (as title states) gave me the impression more than technique was taught in this DVD set. Just two different DVDs with two different instructors. The 2nd ""Professional Massage Therapy v2.0"" is the better DVD. It also goes into a lesson on muscles and Aroma Therapy. 1st one, a bit like watching someone else get a massage and waiting. Anyway, if you have the option, I'd recommend just ordering the 2nd DVD instead of both. I learned more from it."
5,Just what I wanted to find,Loved the full-unabridged version. So easy to understand for us - the older generation. I was very impressed. The secret is out. Massage Therapy is for everyone now. Thanks to this wonderful Massage Pack.
2,don't waste your money,I really regret buying this & wish I would have returned it. I am a student & I didn't learn anything but they had terrible taste in music when recording this. Awful. From all of the other reviews & thought this would be a staple. It is not. You're welcome.
2,Very Poor Picture Quality,"I bought this DVD after reading the reviews, and though the content may be good the quality of the images and the DVD was very very poor. The lecture sections which uses a white board cannot be seen at all. Just watching this makes me feel like i need glasses - and I have perfect eyesight. I am very dissapointed with this purchase."
3,Very grounded approach to mathematics and critical thinking.,It was worth reviewing just to find out about the basis of Euclid's work in the generalization of rules of thumb of carpentry. I've used this material over and over in teaching mathematics and physics.
3,Cute Lion Camping Chair,"This is a very cute chair. It comes with it's own carrying pouch and it is very easy to take in and out of the pouch, even a child can do it! My grandson, age 20 months, has difficulty sitting back in it, however. I anticipate this should get easier in time as he gets bigger."
3,"Pretty nice ""toy""","I got this for my nearly 3 year old. He's about 3'2"" and can climb into this chair super easy.Chair looks cute and once he sat he didn't want to get up anymore.OK, now for the review part.Whatever you do, stay with the child and the chair. A little more butt-movement of the kid and the chair will fall to the side with the kid in it (which I guess you can put that under educational experience, too). The seat is sturdy, and has a safety pin so the chair won't collaps that easy. Sadly, the pin is too easy to get in and out (aka, you put the pin in, put the chair down and the pin is out again). You definitely need a super flat surface for this ""toy"" chair, so camping could get a bit complicated. Right now we only have a ""test-weight"" of about 30 lbs, but I will update once the chair made it's first camping trip."
2,This album sucks,If you like sentenced which i do you probally think oh two c.d.'s for the price of one well don't because their later albums are much better unless you are into heavy death metal of which is just screaming i recommend frozen or crimison. these two albums had complicated and immense guitar and lyrics when you could understand the lyrics so if you plan on singing to this don't unless you want a sore mouth from screaming in another lanuage called crap
3,Avalanche,"If survival stories are your favorite, Avalanche, by Arthur Roth, is for you. It is a survival story about a boy named Chris Palmer, who gets trapped in an avalanche. There are many problems in Chris's family; Chris and his older brother Terry are always trying to outdo each other. Terry seems to be better than Chris is many things, so Chris gets tired of being Number 2. When he decides to show off by shooting a coyote, his gun shot sets off an avalanche. Chris's mind starts to be affected by the cold and he begins to have hallucinations. Will Chris survive under the snow with limited movement and little food? If you are in grades 5 or 6, Avalanche is quite interesting and will capture your attention.David CohenAkeem HamiltonSteven Pichardo"
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,The performance was not as good as I expected. The performance did not tell the story smoothly. I thought it was going to be a more dramatic story.
4,"Though not ultimate, still very good","A very good sampler of classical sacred Christmas music, sung or performed by some of today's finest musicians and singers. Perhaps a bit too generous with selections from Handel's Messiah but all very well arranged and performed. If you liked the Ultimate Hymn CD you should like this Christmas companion."
4,First graphics card,"This is no longer for sale - got it for a PC I built in 2003, but its bugging me to give a review so here it is! I really enjoyed this GPU, great performance for the price and very reliable. After I upgraded I was able to sell it here for about 2/3 what I paid for it. Recommended."
2,NOT IMPRESSED,"THIS WEATHER STATION MIGHT BE CLOSE ENOUGH FOR WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WANTING IT FOR BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO USE FOR SHOOTING. I GOT THIS METER AND WAS COMPARING IT SIDE BY SIDE WITH MY BUDDY'S KESTREL, THE WIND READING WAS BETWEEN 0-5 MPH FAST. SOMETIMES IT WAS RIGHT BUT MOSTLY IT READ FAST. ALSO THE TEMPERATURE WAS OFF BY ABOUT 7 DEGREES. THE OTHER MEASUREMENTS WERE CLOSE ENOUGH (MOSTLY EXACTLY THE SAME) BUT IT WAS BAD ENOUGH THAT I SENT IT BACK AND ORDERED A MORE EXPENSIVE KESTREL UNIT."
2,Good but QA could be better,I got this and right out of the box it looked like refurbished.Scratches on the surface. I had second thoughts if I should return it.It works fine but I would expect for this kind of money a flawless product right out of the box.
2,Not a happy customer,"The skymaster Weather Meter I purchased was a Christmas gift for my Son,who lives in Florida, the meter does not work correctly and I wanted to return the item for credit but according to Builder Depot, the shipper, my 30 day return period has expired. You offer returns until Jan. 31th. because of the holidays, why don't your associates do the same?Now What do I do with a $161.71 gismo that doesn't work? I reply would begreatly appreciated."
4,Great work jeans,I am in construction and these are very tough jeans and the Riggs emblem on the pocket is great for those who keep a tape message on them during the day because it doesn't wear down the pocket like other jeans. Also one negative is that if you put these pants in the drier the color will fade.
4,Hard to find sizes,"I bought these jeans for my nephew. He likes carpenter type jeans that fit loosely, however they are hard to find in his size because he is so tall and thin. 29 X 34 are the size that I ordered, they are just a little big for him, but he's still growing. He wished that they came in a darker blue color."
5,Best work jeans by far!,"My husband'sline of work is very rough on work clothes, and we have fund these jeans to be the strongest by far, I highly recommend them, he has both the light and dark colors, here I have found them for the best price too!"
5,Blue jeans and the canvas\ no rip material,"Both are great pants, fit well and wear like the dickens. Nothing I would change or ask for. Big back pockets for my LCP concealed carry pistol in a little tuck holster so they are what I needed."
2,Look good at beginning,"This jeans came as ordered and were exactly what I thought they were suppose to be. The only problem that I saw with these jeans is after wearing them for the day, the material ""strechted"" out and were a LOT bigger than when I put them on that morning. I would probably not purchase these pants again. I live an active life and do not need or desire to have pants that end up something that I am pulling up to keep on at the end of the day."
4,Riggs Workwear Jeans Review,"Bought this pair of jeans online from Australia. Slight concern that it would not fit. However, no issues. Jeans are well made, fit well and are very comfortable. Only slight criticism is weight of jeans. Quite heavy but this probably reflects the hard wearing nature of the jeans. Overall very happy with it."
5,BEST JEANS EVER,These jeans are comfortable yet very tough. I'm a farmer so lets see how long they last!
1,Sizing problems,"I am a professional carpenter and a co-worker of mine had a pair of these pants and I was very impressed by them. I ordered a pair of them.I wear a size 34 waist from many different major brands of jeans (Carhartts, Levi's, etc) and all of fit well, if not maybe a little tight. That said, I ordered a pair in size 36 waist intentionally wanting a slightly looser fit. When they arrived they were incredibly tight! Be warned....if you order these pants, you may likely pay a guessing game to get the size right.Very disappointed."
2,"too much seat and crotch room, feels very baggy","These jeans have too much room in the crotch seat area, it does not align or conform with the waist size. Other than that the jeans are nice, but too much room in the crotch and seat area ruin it."
3,This book is a good book only some sentences should changed,"VEry exiting and exquisit book!! A MUST read!!!!!! Some sentences are inappropiate though like ""Catholics go to hell"" I know the author didn't mean it, probably but it was very irresponsible. Charasca Dimanchenohu"
4,I'm Happy,"I'm happy with it. Well worth the money. I've purchased or reviewed close to 100 dance DVDs. Initially, over a year ago, when I started dancing and buying dance DVDs; I was extremely unhappy with Teresa Masons DVDs. They were too difficult for me to follow. Now, after learning the very basics of dance, I've pretty much purchased all of hers for under $12.00 each. Reason: I think ""Most bang for the Buck"" if you buy them as cheaply as possible."
5,Great Camera,"I bought this camera to start my production business with and it was the best move I could have made. This camera is great for a beginner like me. It is user friendly while still allowing for ajustments. The HD is also amazing, my customers that have there videos in HD are absolutely floored we they get their finished product. A few things that I can recommend are getting a tripod as well as an extended battery. The stock battery only provides about 45 min with LCD and if you add anything other then the shotgun mic it lowers it even more. Make sure you use only high quality tapes. (I found out the hard way) Good tapes for this camera are going to cost about $10 to $15 but they are worth it when you reduce the time for re-tape due to drop-out on the film. All together this for me is a great camera for the price. Anything better is going to run you about $8000 or more."
4,pdawg productions (HVR-A1U),"The HVR-A1U is a decent camera that is easy to carry around. The picture quality is fair for the price, but the mobility factor and ease of use is a definite perk that makes it worth the buy. A lapel mic would be advised for interviews and quality audio recording. The microphone attachment is mediocre."
4,A Crash Course in Legal Philosophy,"Some twenty authors, from Aristotle to Pound are showcased in this relatively small volume. While it lacks some depth, it is a highly readable compilation."
5,Stimulating and entertaining!,"This poetry collection is tons of fun to read and a visual treat! The poems come alive with creative illustrations throughout the book. For example, in ""Anyone Tennis?"" the poem is arranged in 2 spread out pages so you read from the left page and bounce to the right one and then back to the left and so on---the way your eyes follow the ball in the tennis court! In ""Merging Traffic"" the letters merge into one lane---taking turns! The letters are driving! Words are transformed into birds and on their wings carry your dream toward the sky. Filled with wonderful surprises, it will delight even the most reluctant reader! A ""must"" on your child's reading list!"
1,Poked in the Eye,"This book is fairly complicated for a child. Having studied poetry (especially concrete poetry) in college, the level at which one could fairly comprehend these ""visual poems"" at an entertaining level is probably age 10 and up. While it is an interesting idea, I think it also fails in the sense that the concrete poetry was written to be ""visual"" poetry, where the words make images or convey their meanings through type design. Adding pictures to the already visual poetry seems to detract from the meaning instead of actually adding to the meaning. So, in short, this book isn't good for a four year old (the age of my son, for whom I mistakenly bought this book)."
4,Couldn't put it down,"As I read through Kirk Johnson's account of his journey and motivation and inner search that made up his Badwater ultramarathon experience, I was pulled into his writing the same way long-distance running seduced me as a young man. He captured the euphoria, isolation, drive and the heart and essence of endurance running in a way I haven't seen done. He was lyrical and poetic in his descriptions of the epic battle of man against himself. I would recommend the book to any runner or to anyone who wonders why we run. The only criticism I have are the few moments in the book where Johnson seems to repeat emotions he is feeling that he already has delved into. But the power of the book is evident in that Johnson's gripping tale has created in me a runner who longs to tempt Badwater and Death Valley. Well-done book."
5,"What an adventure, pure reading enjoyment","It was so fabulous to read this highly enjoyable chronicle of Kirk Johnsons journey from nonrunner, basically, to ultrarunner and badwater finisher. Amazing. As an avid runner and ultrarunner, it was refreshing to see the sport from his eyes. Ihad first learned of him in the documentary on the Badwater 135,Running on the Sun. this book chronicles how he first learned about the race, his trianing and time leading up to the race, and the race itself. It was a great book. I recommend it to runners and nonrunners alike."
4,An amazing work,"This is an autobiography in which New York Times reporter Kirk Johnson explains why he raced the Badwater, a race that some consider the most dangerous in the world. He chose running across Death valley as a combination homage to his older brother Roger, a suicide victim as well as a need to cleans his own soul as well. The second half of the book deals with the race itself and is not just excellent. It is some of the best non-fictional literature of the year as the audience begins to understand how far a person is willing to go. The first segment seems more introspective and philosophical, which is insightful but after a time requires ultramarathon endurance. Still TO THE EDGE is a strong account that pays homage to the writer and his family and is worth reading by fans of biographies.Harriet Klausner"
3,"Nice book, but...","First of all, Kirk Johnson writes exceedingly well. He is a consummate wordsmith. But, as some of the other reviewers have observed, he dwells too much on the storm within him - his insecurities and confusions - to the point of the reader wanting to skip some paragraphs and just move on with the narrative. When he does describe the actual race, he does it superbly. His descriptions had me on edge, and felt that I was running alongside him, and suffering with him. If Kirk had dealt more with specifics of the race, rather than with his own demons, this might have been an outstanding book. That said, I would recommend this as a must-read for anyone contemplating an untramarathon anytime in the future. I know that I am on the course for one now."
5,To the Edge,"If you are a runner, this is a must read. Kirk is a gifted writer. I have read many different books on running. This is a self-deprecating story of challenge and reflection. Don't pass this one by. I was inspired and engaged by his ability to write and think deeply about this ultra endurance activity. He reminds us that we are capable of much more than we realize. Kirk shows the reader how, once in a while, life can reconcile past issues."
4,Better than new shoes,Sometimes you need a little boost to get back into training or to get you through a grueling segment. This book inspires well beyond the many other running books out there and will take you further (sic) into running than any set of new shoes or training program.
5,Brilliant,"Really enjoy this Tony Bennett CDSo Smooth and very relaxing, we love It. 4 Stars.Eve and John"
2,"look ""closer""","The whole ""Halo"" shtick is a complete ripoff of the ""Eskaton"" contrivance held out by Coil, a band Reznor was admittedly taken w/ prior to publishing his first record. Also, it's clear that Michael, er, Trent Reznor can't make a great album w/out Mark Ellis (Flood)."
2,Could be better,I initially got this with the idea that I'm able to tear a single piece out and send to individual friends but realised it's a single booklet for just a single friend.The content isnt especially exciting or special..i've got a coupon i bought 6 years back which is much better.It'll also be better if there's more coupons.The money paid for the current number of coupon doesnt seem very worth it to me.
1,I should've known.,"I should've known that this would happen. First album was great, raw fury. Second album gets them famous, but they start to lose some of the chaos factor of the debut and start doing more catchy songs. A bit of a dissapointment, but I was sure that they would pick up again.NOPE.Now, that fury and chaos is pretty much stale and predictable. Production is too crisp and clean, singer sounds ridiculous, and the songs just don't sound interesting. I'm sticking with The Chariot and the Dillinger Escape Plan for chaotic metal. This is just too clean for me."
2,Not That Good,"This CD is not very good. Bless the martyr and kiss the child was better, and O God the aftermath was better than all of them. This cd seems very muffled and his voice is not that great. The CD seems rushed, and just isn't Norma Jean at all. I hope their next CD is better."
1,Scary,"Dude i don't listen to punk Rock..........i mean i like Fall Out Boy but Damnnnnnn what kind of music is this?!!!!!!!!! Whoa...Did someone say never again.........I exxagerate but that is to say , this music is very freaky."
5,"TO ""JESTER GOD"":","Redeemer is a solid album by Norma Jean that incorporates strong riffs, powerful vocals, and deep lyrics. New vocalist Corey Brandon fits into the gap that the talented Josh Scogin left when he started THe Chariot, which is a new grindcore metal band from Atlanta. All-in-all, ""Redeemer"" is a good album that shows Corey Brandon's powerful vocals. If you are a fan of wild Metal/Metalcore, you should consider purchasing this album.Biased reviewers like JESTER GOD should stop writing prejudiced reviews and GROW UP. You are a sad being, Jester God; I hope you will write mature reviews next time and benefit customers of Amazon.com."
3,old school,chaos uk is old school and full OF CHAOS they have better cds so check them all out their all really good go check out angelic upstarts too great OI band
3,Not their best,"Although this is a good album (good lyrics and vocals as usual), the addition of what I can only describe as 80s rock guitar was a detraction for me."
4,Love these logs.,These logs are really lifelike. Setting up was easy. The set puts out plenty of heat. The controls are all located for ease of access. I wish it had a few more logs.
2,out $89 dollars,"received logs but they would't stay lit,had gas co.check pressure cost me $89.Then figured out logs were for natural gas even though I ordered propain and they were clearly marked propain.returned logs and they were replaced with the correct logs which now work correctly but I am still out $89"
1,worthless,"He discloses nothing new nor useful.He has a goal of promoting his products, which are basically sardine oil without the smell.He makes Nick Perricone look reputable."
4,Well Dug In,"This is a good effort. Visually, the editors had obtained a fair selection of contemporary film using the Maginot Line, and have interspersed this with modern visuals of restored and maintained sections. The on-screen commentators were generally well-informed and clear and the editorial voice did a fair job of placing the Line in the context of politics and military theory between the World Wars. The ""context"" film--scenes of late WWI or of rearmament--sometimes subverted the voice-over, but that's a minor quibble. I was pleased I bought the DVD,and would happily buy a longer one by the same people on any subject that interested me."
1,what a disappointment,"the blue (golden) malrin does not work. i've used the product when it was ""golden"" in color and it worked very well. i would not recommend the blue colored ""golden malrin"" to anyone. it does not attract flies--if a fly happpens on it and eat some, they die--but they are not attracted to it. i think i've been totally riped-off."
1,Worst Drive I have ever used,"This is the worst hard drive I have ever used. I purchesed one, just to return it right away for not being able to read cd's (took me 12 tries to just to get it to download my motherboard drivers off the cd!), I then payed for another one and within 8 DVD burns and 18 lightscribe burns it stopped working completely! This drive would only burn using Nero Burning software and nothing else.I would NOT recommend this drive to anybody!"
1,Avoid this junk,"Mine made 2 DVDs and 0 out of 10 attempts to burn aAudio CD. It runs horrendously warm and if you tryedto use light scribe right after burning the DVD itgave a ""internal error"" error.Then it started giving ""Track Following Errors"" and wouldn'tread or write a CD/DVD, home made or commercial.So I took it back to Best Buy. They no longer carried the 740iso I said what the hey, I'll get the 840iWell so far it will read and burn a disk, but if youdon't wait at least 5 minutes after burning a diskand try to burn a light scribe image it over heatsand gives the same ""Internal error"" message...HP needs to resolve this issue....."
1,hope you don't need hp support,HP support should be called non-support. I have bought a lot of HP products in the past but have always been lucky enough to have them all hold up through the warranty period until now. Bought a Pavilion Media Center PC with lightscribe and less than 5 months later the lightscribe dvd died. Do they get me a replacement or just the run around? You got it....the run around. I will never and I advise everyone else not to buy from HP until they can prove to stand by their warranties.
1,"High hopes, but very disappointed","Lightscribe isn't the most importent thing in a DVD burner, but it's the reason I went with this particular product instead of a number of alternatives. As an aftermarket addition to my Dell 4550 computer I can tell you after many many hours of frustration that although it burns DVDs just fine, the lightscribe does not work. I am not the only one with this problem, it is common as I have now found out. It will not recognize Verbatim or Memorex Lightscribe DVDs, including the free Lightscribe DVD that came with the product. I have tried SureThing (bundled with this product) and Nero, to no avail. I updated the system software off the Lightscribe site and there is no newer update for the 740i. I finally called HP to try to talk with someone and was told that technical support for this product will cost $30 a call !!!!!!!!! Goodby HP."
2,"Dead Heroine Makes A Comeback...How, Excactly?","The main protagonist of The Descent, Sarah, does not make it out alive in the first movie. Yet, somehow, she is alive for this sequel. The film isn't bad on it's own, but it comes with a back story that renders this one impossible. Had Sarah survived the first film, it would not have been even half as poignant. If she survives in some alternate ""get me a sequel"" corporate boardroom universe, there is a lucrative sequel. Hollywood has stooped to new lows here and, at the same time, made a pretty entertaining flick. Confusing."
3,Wasn't completely let down,"After seeing the first Decent, I was thinking that the sequel couldn't possibly be as good. I was right. The sequel is good, and still has some parts that make you jump, but I like the first better. I think the grainier footage made the first movie incredible. Also, the first one looked like they filmed it a little darker which also added to the movie. The sequel looked a little too much like a movie set in some scenes. It was a brighter movie, which I think took away from the ""edge of your seat"" feeling. It also had a couple of twists that I wasn't expecting. The sequel is by far not a let down like so many others are, but the first one is definately my favorite. Sequel is worth seeing though."
4,My body speaks,"This movie transforms you to being one of the girls or team. The squeezing through, heavy breathing motion. You must see The Descent to continue enjoying Part 2. Becoming one of the girls, of course, Juno or Sarah, in the movie is what makes it fun. My imagination of being inside the cave and meeting up with those creatures gives me the shivers. Its got to smell terribly so my allegies whould give me away immediately and I would be the first to go."
3,Falls far short of the original,"OK first off I would like to say I enjoyed The Descent, maybe not as much as some but it was a well done horror movie. This sequel, however, falls far short of the original. I can say if you haven't seen the original you may like this movie a little more then you would otherwise.Slight spoilersThe sequel starts off with the only known survivor escaping the caves only to be forced back in by a nasty sheriff. Where the movie trips up in relation to the original is the constant showing of the monsters. In the original the monsters were seen much less and the tension was able to build. In this one, it feels forced and hurried. You don't really care about any of the characters since none are really fleshed out. Still, its worth a watch."
1,SPOILERS GALORE Do not read unless you have seen The Descent,"The Descent is a kick a** movie. However, I refuse to watch Descent 2.Why??As you should know, if you saw the uncut original Descent, Sarah Does NOT make it out of the Cave. She dies in the cave. So how can you have a Descent 2 with the person who died in the cave?In the Theatrical Descent, she wakes up in the car, but that is reversed or explained in the Original Uncut ending, that it was a Dream and she woke up in the cave. Her last vision being her Dead Daughters Brithday.You cannot reverse something that you already explained in the original Uncutversion that adds on to the theatrical Version. That is like having a double do-over or a reversal of a reversal which would take you back to the double negative making it a positive.why don't you go make a Gone with the Wind 2"
2,The first one is better,I wouldn't recommend buying this movie until you've seen it first because it's not as good as the first one!
1,So it takes two,"I love the fist one; what a well done movie! ""Then came part 2"" Has you start to watch this one you see the magic start slipping away, descending down a dark hole. There are characters you really like and decent actors. the writers of this should stayed in a hole. The ending made no sense whatsoever. I feel these writers had no more ideas so they said "" Hey lets trash this"" Sorry my friends you need to go back to creative writing school and learn how to write. I could of written a better script then this.If you must know what happens from the first go for it. But I loved the ending of the first it made your mind wonder. Just remember it took two writers to for this one. i think Hollywood is slipping."
3,Halfway decent.,"Personally, I prefer the unrated director's cut of the first film. That said, the ending of that version does not jive with where this movie picks up the story at all since the lead character died at the end of that.This one had a few unexpected turns here and there, but I suspect that anyone that is hard core horror fan will predict a lot of it. There wasn't too much originality here. Pretty stereotypical for a slasher movie overall. But that isn't to say it isn't amusing to some degree. Some parts seemed like just copies of the first movie and literally and figuratively, reliving several scenes. There were a few more gross out moments that seemed completely unnecessary and overly gratuitous.I wasn't ticked I spent the money on a rental and it kept my attention, but I don't intend to buy this one."
4,The Descent 2,"Don't you hate it when you escape an ordeal, only to find yourself back because of evil people? Worst is when you have no memory so you can't stop yourself from going back. Anyway, this sequal was better than i thought. Two old faces from the first return in this film and they both keep the movie going. The other cave members were interesting and this film did feel like the first one, with more similitaries than a whole new experience. I don't know if there is going to be a part 3, bit if there is. i won't be shocked if it's a prequel."
5,"most sequels suck,but this one!!!!!","this is the acception to all those crapy sequels.period.Iloved the 1st/and let me tellya the 2nd is just as good, even better in my eyes. IF YOU CRAVE GORE,GOOD STORY SAME PEOPLE FROM THE 1ST MOVIE AND a feeling of being TOTALLY TRAPT UNDERGROUND this is for the TRUE horror JUNKIE like myself.THX.seee thisssss"
2,Only one word to decribe this movie..............,"REPETITIVE!!!!!!!!! So, that equals BORING! Blood looked like a pink tomato paste. I cant even write a good review on this trash"
2,HUGE disappointment,"A misfire with only a few bright moments. With the writer/director of the original film producing this one, why didn't he clean up the awful script? So much goes wrong here - the lead character has zero depth here and goes from zombie to Ms Rambo - a character who has absolutely zero chance of living in the first film...umm...survives for part 2. Instead of being a surprising twist it was an "" oh come on, you're kidding"" moment. The new movie focuses on gore instead of suspense and intensity. The stupendously horrible last minute ""twist"" ending that makes no sense. Bad acting, bad writing, it is surprising the movie is such a mess, and a shame. Avoid as if it were the plague."
2,Very disappointing,"The original movie, The Descent, blew me away. The sequel? not so much. Not really worth making, either. This movie did not come close to capturing the atmosphere and excellent characterization of the first, and without those, the story comes across as just silly. The ending was ridiculous. The characters from the first movie who appear in this one are just one-dimensional this time around and not even remotely likable. The new characters appear to have been added only so that there would be a respectable body count, along with adding a vaguely plausible excuse to get the blonde lady to go back into the cave (which, obviously, she would not have done on her own. Even she isn't that crazy). All I can say is that if you want to see random fighting, caves, and running around screaming, go ahead and rent it. If you want something more, watch something else."
3,The Descent: Part 2,"I thought that the characters didnt't have very much depth. And although the movie was scarey, it wasn't that exciting or suspenseful. The best scene was when Cathy was caught in that mini-rock cave and that creature was trying to dig her out. That was very good! From the moment when she was talking on the radio, to when the creature was first seen behind her, until his head got crushed under the rock! It was the ,best scene of the whole movie,I think. All of it."
5,Excellent,Prompt delivery in excellent shape...this movie has very surprising results; through me for a loop!! Highly recommend to anyone who loves suspense.
2,Disappointing,"It was not that good. It was such a let down compared to the 1st one, and especially considering what they could have done with it. Jeez! There were major plot holes, and the acting is really quite bad, and the dialogue, my God, I had my hand over my face. Some amazing gore and action sequences, but there is not one thing in this film that was not in the first one. We were looking fwd to this since 2006 when the 1st film came out and we saw it in the theater maybe 5 times. I knew it was a done deal when it went straight to DVD. I knew not to expect too much, but even still, I am very disappointed in this film. I can only hope Neil Marshall returns to helm the 3rd one and save the whole thing from certain death."
5,Better than normal for a part 2,I watched this in hopeful expectation and this movie exceeded it. I leaves off where the Descent ends. Very gorey and bloody which makes it even better. Usually I don't like the sequels to movies because they're usually lame but this one pulls no punches and is every bit at good as the first one! There's a surprise in it too!
1,"Could have fixed the first movie, but . . ..","I don't care what they said in ""Scream,"" I want a REASON for a villain to do something. Yes, the crawlers are hunting food. The old man, however, seemed to have no reason for what he did to the deputy at the end of the movie.I was pleased that Juno survived the first movie, but this did little to correct the horrible ending of this one."
2,Really not necessary...,"Ohhh, the disapointment. This might have worked better as a stand-alone film with different characters (or not) but The Descent 2 is light years away from the well-crafted first film. There was no tension, the characters do stupid things, and the monster design changed for the worse. The second film is supposed to take place 2 days later, so why would the Crawlers look different? Yeesh.If you like cave creepy-crawly movies this might work for you, but I felt like I wasted my time."
2,Not worth the trip back.,"Some remakes are great. This is not one of them.Aside from one surprise, the movie is pretty predictable and slow moving. It misses the storyline and character development of the first which made that movie all the more powerful. The sequel appeared to have been made because the first was so successful. Should have left what was dormant in the cave alone."
1,Nothing much to see here,Some people in a cave with a monster. That's about it with nothing of any interest happening. They seem to crank out these movies with no idea on how to make a horror movie.
2,Why did I watch Descent 2?,"There only redeeming part in this movie was for the second at the end where the female cop gets hit in the face with a shovel. I highly recommend you spend your money on something other than this, or it's prequel, ""Descent""."
3,Not a worthy sequel at all!,"Seeing as The Descent is on my Top 10 scariest horror flicks, I was super excited to see the sequel. What a sad follow up to the original. The acting in it (aside from the some of the originals from the first), was awful. There was no development in the character's relationships at all. I pretty much didnt care if they died or not. The creatures werent as scary and they added some really stupid screams to them. Even though the movie was overall pretty lame as a follow up, they did make up for it with gore. There is a lot more gore in this one, some of it just downright laughable! Watch this if you are a fan of the first, its worth it just so you can hold the original in your mind as being so so so much better."
5,Just as good as the first,"If you enjoyed Descent then hold on to that pillow. These movies prove you can still get a good scare without all the crap they overload you with in other horror films. I thought these flicks would be too dark to watch being in a cave and all. But that wasn't the case the Decent movies were well done, had just enough gore and a good story line. If you like these flicks be sure and watch The Cave (2005)."
2,Just watch the original again for about the same effect.,"This... was basically the same as the first movie, if the first movie was not very good. If you like watching extended scenes of heads being bashed in and blood splurting out of wounds, you will probably enjoy this film. For me, it passed the line from scary into silly, and while I certainly enjoy a good campy bloodsplatter fest now and again, it seems a shame to do that in a sequel to a film that was so much more than that.Really, if you liked The Descent because there were attractive women covered in blood attacking or being attacked by monsters... go for it! You will like this movie. But if you liked it for being a suspenseful, well done horror flick... skip the sequel and watch the first one again. Because seriously, it's pretty much the same thing."
2,Good - until the horrible ending,"Despite the negative reviews, I decided to give Descent 2 a try. It is good escapist viewing with plenty of action and surprises. The crawlers are as vicious as in Descent and the blood and gore are increased from the original. I still enjoyed the movie - until the ending. Without going into what happened, it changed my perception of the movie. IMHO it was one of the worst movie endings ever. Hopefully more perceptive people than myself can write a review which explains - WTFH at the end?"
3,Good but not as great as the original,"Lots of chills and claustrophobic cave scenes with horrible blinds albino cannibals..!!!But the movie suffers from being a sequel, because you already know all you need to know about the premise."
2,Death by franchise... utterly unnecessary and poorly done sequel,"Don't be fooled; this is bloody terrible... Ludicrous plot, terrible acting and dialog. If you're a fan of the first (and not entertained by crap) be happy with the 1st and ignore this.Biggest sucks:*Whole film is about 5000% brighter than the first. Is this in a cave or a grocery store?*Cave dwellers turned into pigs for some reason.*The cave itself looks like a high school play set... Bright lights do not help.*PATHETIC sequel setup at the end that is laughable, yet infuriating.*RUINS what was one of the best endings I've ever seen (apparently not the theatrical ending)This is very high on the the list of completely unnecessary sequels.LAME... be on the lookout for Descent 3 and maybe 4, which are bound to be the mayor of suck town."
2,Disappointed,"The Descent is one of my favorite films by far. I was surprised when a sequel was announced. To me, the first film (uncut version) resolved everything. My greatest fears were confirm when I finally got to watch The Descent Part 2 over the weekend.What were they thinking! Leave well enough alone!"
2,Consider Something Else!,"This book was a great disappointment! I am building a large application in PHP and was looking for some good project planning strategies and patterns. Instead I found the usual shopping cart examples written as if for a small scale project. The code snippets are full of white space and a few lines of code takes up an entire page, hence it is hard to follow. What little code I did try was full of errors and bad syntax. This book does not have a CD with it so you must type in all the code that you may want to start with. I suggest the book 'Web Applications Development with PHP 4.0' for your true professional projects."
2,Almost Unreadable,"Its not the worst book I've own, but it is very much a ""type this in and view it"" type book. No real explaining of deep concepts or anything like that. As far as the typos, sheesh(!), they are everywhere. And the code examples are so misaligned and wrapped around the page so strangely it is the very definition of unreadable code.Skip this one,..."
1,"Lots of typo, not really for professional projects","First off, this is not a book for professional projects. The topics that the author discuss are very basic and not really pointing out any key concept. This book is more appropriate with the title such as 'Beginner Guide to PHP'. There are also typos throughtout the entire book. I spent more time correcting the errors in the code sample than graspping the concept itself. Not to mention that the examples layout on the page are very unorganized, the book doesn't make good use of margin and tabs. The screen captures are not very well prepared. Good book to read for fun or freshing up on PHP, but definetely not for professional projects."
5,A Jewel on the lower eastside!,"What a great book, Filled with so many beautiful stories abouta wonderful Man and his gift to New Yorks lower East Side.I feel so blessed to have lived on East 5th street for 25 years and had the chance to drop by whenever I needed a little soul food. Every time I pick up,Abs's book I feel Like I am home again.I have given this book as a gift to so many friends its the perfect gift, It is filled with so many authentic recipes! Perhaps the Old Testament needs ONE more Book! This is the One!Abe you will always be a part of the very Heart and Soul Of New yorks lower East side. This book brings a little of that into every home no matter where that may be.Thank you, Thank youan old neighborhood friendNorman Ader"
5,Second avenue DeliCookbook,"Delightful to read,especially the history part.Recipes sound interesting and good.Well worth having to add to any collection of cookbooks."
4,2nd Avenue Deli Recipe book,This book is as much history and food inspired. The recipes made my mouth water just thinking about them and the stories behind the food were bits of history. The recipes are easily followed. The ingredients explained in a straighforward manner. My husband wanted to know the recipe for their coleslaw. We both got even more from the book and enjoyed the stories as much as the food!
4,"Excellent book, but nothing beats Molly Goldberg","I enjoyed looking through this book, but when it comes to finding and following a recipe, I prefer The Molly Goldberg Jewish Cookbook. Her recipes are straightforward and easy-to-follow--and they always come out like my grandmother's. Her anecdotes are entertaining, as are Leberwohl's, but more down-homey--about family rather than celebrities."
4,Just two little things,"Two small complaints, however: (1) nothing in this book is particularly healthful, and (2) some recipes require contents that are not particularly easy to come by if you're outside of a very Jewish area. It would have been nice if the authors had included substitution information for those two situations.Otherwise, it's an excellent cookbook with a wide variety of recipes, as the other reviewers have mentioned."
4,Mixed review,"[...] It's a cute shoe, but did not fit my foot. I purposely ordered half a size up because my foot tends to be a wider width, but the shoe was still too tight. The good news is that shoes.com gives pre-paid return address labels, so the return went very smoothly. I would order again from them...but not this particular style because of how it fit."
5,The Best Possible Help,"This book helped so much while I was living with my husband who was dying from cancer. It gave good, practical advice that was not only helpful but easy to follow. It included everything I needed from how to assemble a medical and legal team to how to contact Social Security or the military to obtain a flag and a burial spot. I can't recommend it highly enough."
4,Conceptualization is wonderful.,"A bit better than their debut, Night of the Stormrider adds a better singer, and its Iced Earth's first concept album. The lyrics could be read from song to song as one long epic poem. Though there is one chapter missing, I've heard: on the import there is a bonus track that fits into the story. (why doesn't america get the good stuff:( )"
2,Bits of brutal beauty,"2 1/2Fans of IM's sound will be happy with modern torchbearers, but there isn't a whole lot to remember besides the occasional inspired instrumental segue that hasn't been done a thousand times before and after."
4,must have,Do not forget to get all the parts you need to complete the job. Part was right price and shipped on time.
2,Didn't fit wrong size,"It was packaged well and the price was right. Big problem was the wrong size. It said it was for the size motor I had but it wasn't so as there are numerous types I would suggest if you do not have the ""for sure"" part number just take the old one down to a motor dealer and match it up."
5,Great historical persepective of social welfare systems in the US.,"This is a required book for my SASS 470 class at MSASS-CWRU where I pursuing my Masters of Science in Social Administration; otherwise known as Masters of Social Work.The book is well written and organized, sometime I just wish the print was clearer and larger. Some of the printing was a bit ""wavy"", and it's not my eyes!The book is a ""must read"" for graduate social work student. It's a keeper!This book arrived in good condition and the shipping was fast."
4,Fast paced and surprising,"This mystery involving Kate Shugak brings new insight into life in Alaska. This time the environment is fishing on rivers. In addition to the crimes to be solved, questions about the relative fairness of commercial, sport, and fishing natives who have special dispensation to fish when others cannot are brought up. A truly fast-paced good read."
3,Killing Grounds,Better than average Kate Shugak but still something lacking. I guess the novelty of a Native American female sluth has worn off somewhat.
4,interesting,I've learned a lot about Alaska reading these series. the charaters are varied and you find yourself liking some and hating to hear about the lost of others. The residents of state parks are a country unto themselves.Everyone has a story.I like not knowing how it's going to end
2,Just Couldn't Get Into This One,"I've thoroughly enjoyed the first seven Kate Shugak novels, but this one left me cold. Maybe it's the subject matter: fishing. Maybe it's because the dead guy needed killing, so who cared? I hope Stabenow is back on her game in No. 9, or I may abandon the series. But the first seven definitely made it worth giving this author another chance."
4,Devastating,"Grave was one of the first death metal bands i heard when i was 13, back in 1994. The title track was actually the first song i heard and i was blown away. Mid-paced death metal turned into straight forward fast death riffs with some really gruesome vocals. Killer melodies thrown in for some variation. This is true death metal at its finest, classic band, classic sound."
5,From the very depths...,This is definately a top notch album. Every track destroys! Suprisingly one of the heaviest hitting albums on my stereo system. Though you don't need a killer system to enjoy the carnage these Swedish kings flawlessly produced I definatly recomend it. You'll Never Regret...buying this album!!!
2,Dortmunder - underdone,"I have enjoyed several of the Dortmunder books. This is just barely a Dortmunder book. Dortmunder is in it, but not much. If you know the Dortmunder gang, you might find some humor in the first half of the book. Otherwise, there are way too many new characters to make it interesting. When I finished the book, I felt cheated. My guess is that a young editor didn't feel confident enough to say to the money-making author: This is at best a first draft of the first two-thirds of a Dortmunder story that needs more Dortmunder."
2,The Downward Road,"John Dortmunder's stock in trade is coming up with dazzlingly brilliant robbery schemes which then proceed to fall apart for completely unexpected (and usually very funny) reasons. In ""The Road To Ruin"", unfortunately, Dortmunder's plan isn't all that brilliant, and the way it falls apart isn't all that unexpected.Author Donald Westlake is still a consummate pro, however, so even in a subpar outing like this there are at least some good laughs scattered throughout. But if you're thinking of making this your introduction to the Dortmunder gang, please reconsider. Almost any other book in this series will do a better job of getting you hooked, except maybe ""What's The Worst That Could Happen?"" -- a great read, but funnier if you already know Dortmunder's case history."
5,Another Home Run,"This is one of my favorite Dortmunder gang novels. While it is not as outlandishly physical as stealing a cherry picker and dashing through London with Dortmunder in the bucket, (Nobody's Perfect,) it is extraordinary social satire. As a premise, the rich white-collar criminal who can't pay enough to keep servants opens the door for comic gold. Gangleader Dortmunder, a career criminal who looks like a disappointed bloodhound, has very little promise as a butler.Westlake is a master at weaving a plot from three capers getting in each other's way. And his wry, understated characterization never slows things down. An excellent start for those new to the series, and a wonderful entry into the canon."
3,Dortmunder lite,"Not up to the usual Dortmunder caper antics. Too much time with underdeveloped other characters and not enough of the zany stuff that normally happens.Three stars for Westlake, just because he is a great writer. He recently penned a new Keller book which is awesome, so I know he still has the creative juices flowing. Maybe next time!"
5,Donald Westlake novel,There has never been a Westlake novel that rates less than five stars. Pure enjoyment.
2,Okay Book,"This book seemed faded in color, Wishing that was addressed in the description, over all it was okay, nothing brand new, or new."
1,Disappointed,What I missed and really did look for was if the book on cd was abridged or not. I thought it wasn't but to my disappointment it was. So a waste. Hate abridged books.
5,"This is a hat for life, The best of the best.",This hat is excellent. It is good value. Very good service. It fits perfectly. There is also a lifetime warranty which is very good. This hat looks good and protects your face head and neck from the sun.
3,Tilley T4 - Extra Sun Protection,The Tilley T4 - Extra Sun Protection had a defect on it. I accepted when my shipping cost was credited. I have used it often and have gotten a lot of positive comments.
1,Tilley,"No matter if is raining or the sun is ""hot"" this is the shade you'll need!!Saludos, Allan.2012-10-08:Now, with the use, is too floopy for me. Trash it."
1,"Average Hat, not worth the price, guarantee not all it's cracked up to be","For the price I would expect this to be a really comfortable hat that I would enjoy wearing. But whilst there was nothing wrong with it, I did not find it that brilliant. I have owned similar and very much cheaper hats before or since and have noticed no difference. In fact the cheaper and lighter the hat, the better. My other gripe was that I was persuaded to buy this with a lifetime guarantee of replacement if it got lost. Turns out this is not so. Although the label attached mentions this, there is small print inside the instruction manual saying that loss is only covered for two years and they will charge you half price for a replacement plus postage. I won't be buying any more of these."
5,ONE STAR review???,"I fully realize that everyone is due they're opinion on an item. However, I simply cannot understand a 1 star.I've owned my Tilley for MANY years. I can't imagine how many times I've come in from a long walk with it soaked to the top with perspiration, dropped it in the kitchen sink with a little soap and let it soak for awhile. Comes out PERFECT every time. I can only guess at fifty or more times I've done that! Do THAT with another hat.Is there a SIX star review? If so, change my 5 to a 6! It's worth TWICE what I paid for it. By The Way... My wife has a Tilley, too."
2,Not my favorite...,"I had a very hard time getting through this one. I have enjoyed some of Smith's other work, but I had to force myself through this one. The characters were one-dimensional caricatures and the plot seemed contrived and disjointed. This story was certainly not as tightly woven as FAMILY LINEN, which I enjoyed immensely."
2,Didn't hold up well,"I have used this mini chopper probably a dozen times. It worked really well for the first 10 or so times, but then it just stopped spinning at all. I was so sad because it was really handy. I'll probably pay a little more next time and get a better chopper."
1,Duality 88220 Mini Chopper,"I believe that there is a design problem with the lid design-it cracked on the third use.But here is the big SURPRISE-the Duality 88220 Mini Chopper is a discontinued product, as the service group at 201 439 1700 told me and they no longer support the prouct."
3,"great product, but broken","I bought this for my mom as she loves Dualit products. Problem: it arrived broken. Amazon was not very helpful - they didn't have any more in stock. Dualit was semi-helpful. She spoke to many many many different people and has yet to receive her replacement part. So we'll see. But she said the chopper is ""gorgeous."""
2,"Slow, Plodding. Forced","I loved the original ""Encounter"" and was super anticipating the sequel. while watching this, it was so slow and plodding along I actually fell asleep. I was bored beyond reason. This movie is very forced. There are some good points and I won't take that away from it, and some good lines, but this sequel does not convey the message like the first one. I hope there is not a third one, or if there is, they should go back to the diner. Sometimes, a good movie is better left without a Sequel. Sorry to be a downer, but this is just not as good as the original."
3,"disappointing ""sequel""","I was seriously anticipating the sequel because the first movie ""Encounter"" was great. The second movie was not nearly as good as the first. It seems to me like they made a sequel just for the $$. It's an OK Christian movie-but the plot line doesn't follow the first; they seem to be just using the name for marketing sake. Bruce Marchiano (as Jesus) is still there-but that's the only similarity I see. To be honest-I got only got halfway through the movie-it didn't engage me enough to pick it back up & see the 2nd half yet. In my opinion, it's not a sequel-it's using the name of an established (GOOD) movie to market the so-called follow-up."
3,I really didn't like the movie...,"There was to much violence in this movie for me. I love the first one, but this one I would not tell anyone to buy this movie."
1,"ok, but they have one issue that ruins it.","i liked the first and thought i would love the second one. however there is one part which is a very small part of the movie, a single moment really that ruins the movie. one of the characters sister who died from drug overdose. he said she is in heaven wih jesus because when she was a little girl she accepted jesus. i cant stand the false teaching that once saved always saved. its wrong and is opposite of what the bible says. the bible does not support the false once saved always saved lie. in fact there are tons of parts that proove the exact oposite. i am very disappinted that they would teach this. if it wasnt for this one isntance i would have given 4 or even 5, but it deserves a 1 for teaching false teachings."
5,Encounter Paradise Lost,"Wonderful to watch how Pure Flix deals with certain issues. Great how they portray the violence, but downplay the intensity."
5,Fantastic read!,"This series is going to be one of the HOT, HOT bestsellers ever! The story is easy to follow, yet gripping. One day, when the Lord comes, these are the things that will happen in our lives. It's fun having ""Revelation"" put into interesting stories. Read it! You just cannot put it down after taking it up!"
4,This is a good book...really,"I was really surprised by the reviews on this book, I thought that it was a very good book when I first read it, and I'm about to read it again. I got ""left behind"" so to speak and now I want to read the series without interruption or having to wait for the next book to come out. I'm looking forward to it being as enjoyable as the first time I read it. It's fiction based on the Bible, so I think some may be judging too harshly. It's worth reading."
3,"I've Read Better, but I've Read Worse","I started this book with an open mind (even though it was given to me by a very religious person, as I am not one myself). I would say most of the book is entertaining and sometimes even hard to put down. Despite the sometime pages of preaching the authors got themselves into, this is an okay book. I am still undecided about reading the other 11, although I am sure I will not buy them (thanks to libraries). I agree with what a lot of the other reviews are saying. Do your research before you get this book - especially if you are not religious."
3,Not bad..but kinda boring,"I found myself bored with this book. I still haven't finished it. I enjoyed the character of the pilot and his problems, but was bored with the writer. I hope the rest of the series is better."
1,"5 star lemmings, crimeny!",My kindergartener has a better grasp of the revealed word of God and definitely has shown flashes of better writing than the authors of Left Behind. All of these 5 star ratings make me ashamed to be a Christian. Why? Because the book is a lousy piece of fiction. I can only assume the high ratings are the result of the lemming behavior typical of the brainwashed victims of fundamentalist cultdom. Life is short - don't waste any of it on this book.
1,What a silly book...,"I am sorry I wasted my time with it...I should have ""left it behind."" If the characters and plot line became any thinner the book would disappear!"
1,Should have been left behind,"As a believer, I am embarrassed and concerned by this series. The heavy-handed preaching lacks charity, wisdom and literary craftsmanship."
5,Left Behind,Very good book. Everyone should read this book and the rest of the series. I have a very hard time putting these books down.
1,Simpson's Episode Says It All,"I just watched the new ""Left Below"" episode of the Simpson's last night that pretty much says it all. I can't believe the amount of Christians that literally believe that being taken up in the air means they will go flying out of vehicles they are driving, causing them to crash, etc. God, people can be so stupid. Even being beamed aboard a spaceship makes more sense! It's really said that all you pathetic, ignorant people are making these two fundamentalist authors rich. Don't you have better things to spend your money or your time with? Educate yourself instead of willfully dumbing yourself down!"
2,The trashy romance novel of religious literature,"I have to admit that part of my problem may have been that I had higher hopes for this book. One of my friends did his senior thesis on this series and, seeing that he had written about them in his thesis, I expected this book to be a well written novel; one of those books that really makes you think. I was very wrong. It is interesting enough, but the plot does not move very quickly and it seems as if it is written for someone who does not have a college education. If you are looking for a book to read on the beach during the summer, I recommend this series. It is not very intellectual and you can read it relatively quickly. However, if you are looking for a book to challenge you and really make you think... look elsewhere."
3,Left in the Middle,"I picked up a copy of ""Left Behind"" after making a deal with a very close friend. I agreed to read ""Left Behind"" and he agreed to read ""The Case for Christ"" by Lee Strobel. Unfortunately, I would have to say that he had the better of the two.One of my greatest fears as a Pastor is that people will read this book (as well as the whole series) and take it as firm Christian belief and doctrine. Sure, it is an interesting story -- but it must remain that -- a story!All in all, I felt ""Left in the Middle"" after reading it. Would I recommend it to a friend who has questions concerning the ""last days""? Probably not. Would I recommend it to a friend that wanted to read a soap opera? Sure.If you are looking for an interesting story, then pick it up and give it a try. If you are looking for more meat and substance, then there are plently of other wonderful books out there."
1,Garbage,"Fluff. Not bad if you want to kill some time, but to take this FICTION as truth telling the end of the world is to ignore billions of years of evidence to the contrary- the world isn't about to end, folks.Jesus' point was to be good to one another, not to run about willy-nilly, feeling superior that you're going to be taken in the Rapture!"
2,Clunky Writing,"I figured I'd check this book out just based on its sales (10 million people can't be wrong etc...) However, sadly I found it to be very poorly written and really really cliched. There was never a scene where I didn't feel like I had read it somewhere else before. I was amazed when I saw all the writing credits the co-authors had, considering how poorly written and constructed it was. The dialogue was so bad that I was laughing to myself. However, if you want to learn vaguely about ""the rapture"" in a well worn fiction format and haven't seen the omen then have a field day..."
4,Intriguing,"If someone had told me a month ago I would be reading books characterized as ""christian/inspirational"" I would've laughed. But the story in Left Behind (and Tribulation Force, at least as far as I've got) is quite compelling even if you do not consider yourself a religious person. The manner in which the characters deal with trying circumstances and drastic changes in their world and outlook would be interesting to anyone. In addition, the religious aspect has sparked many interesting debates among my friends and family. Any book that can do that is worth reading. :)"
5,A keep you on the edge of your seat book!,"Awesome, it really describes the end times!!!!!! Look forward to reading the other in the series."
1,"God only gives us ""one ""chance!","I was really trying to get into this book but it took me weeks to even read the whole thing. It was entertaining in a way but so misleading for anyone not Bibically sound. God is only giving us this ""one"" chance on Earth...not ""well, you didn't make the first round try again"".. I'd hate people to get that idea from this book even if it is fictional."
1,Christians one-up Scientologists,"Have seen all the books at Costco (which says thay they are popular), and hey ... I hate to be ""left behind"" as much as the next guy. After all, the only other time I have fell into reading a truely lousy popular book was the L. Ron Hubbard's book ""Battlefield Earth"". I was not blindsided by the religious storyline, I knew what I was getting into, but pride myself on being a fan of good writing. Well, this is *not* good writing! You know how sometimes it takes a while to ""get into"" a book. Eventually the characters get interesting and you fall into the writers style. It never happens here, it was drugery from beginning to end. If you must read this do yourself a favor and purchase it as cheaply as possible (have seen on used book sites for a buck and a half), but the book is better ""left behind"" all together. There seem to be some zealots doing reviews so i'll just stay anonymous."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"I just bought ""Left Behind"" almost a week ago and amalmost done with it. It's one of those ""read all night, can't putit down"" books! ""Left Behind"" deals with the Rapture and gives a very realistic view of what could happen. Any book that can hold my attention for more than a couple chapters deserves 5 stars! Can't wait to move on to the second book ""Tribulation Force""!"
5,One of the most riviting and exciting books I've read!,I really loved this book. I just couldn't stop reading it until I was done! It's a real page turner. It also makes you think about life in a cosmic sence. It really brings God into the readers life. It did for me.
1,Too simplistic for most who need to hear the 'message'.,"Arrogance is surely as wrong as lust, greed, and a host of other sins. Yet even before we get to the authors' message, we read [in the dedication] ""For Alice MacDonald and Bonita Jenkins [the authors'mothers(?)], who ensured we would not be left behind"". As a born-again Christian, I too hope I won't be left behind, but I have no way of knowing how God views my sins and whether my repentance is real. Only God knows the heart. And only God knows who will, and will not, be left behind."
1,Should have left it on the shelf!,"I am not one to quit reading a book, no matter how lousy, but I was tempted. I like apocalyptic fiction. This work made me feel like the time I let one of those guys in the white short sleeve shirts and ties in the house and was verbally pinned to my couch by his proselytizing. I don't like to have religion shoved down my throat in the guise of a promise of a good read. Yuck!"
5,Left Behind,"I was not sure I wanted to read another book about the Rapture of the Church. I found some of the twists within the story goofy, but the basis of the story caused me to think about my spirituality and how deep it runs. It was also a piece of fiction that I did not forget shortly after reading it. It caused me to think and ask questions.Being a Christian who does believe that the Rapture will occur, that some people will be ""left behind,"" and that the scriptures of Revelations will occur, I found the story engrossing. Its easy reading and plot line should appeal to many."
1,"Bad Theology, worse writing!","This is all based on Darbyism... a faulty British import theology of the 19th Century.Before Darby, the book of Revelation was understood to be ""allegory"", concerning the persecution of early Christians by the Emperor Domitian.Read Barbara Rossing's ""The Rapture Exposed"" to discover that the book of Revelation is really a message of HOPE! Our God is a God of Love, not a God of Destruction!"
2,For Christians only.,"Side note: This book was obviously written for Christians only. It portrays non-Christians as ignorant people who are too proud to realize the Bible is right and tries to prove this point by setting the story in a world where biblical prophecies are coming true. Of course if prophecies came true you could believe in it, but not in the real world where the Bible - or any other scripture for that matter - doesn't hold up to critical analysis.As for the book itself, it is mildly interesting and it sets up for some interesting adventures to come, and it is obvious that it was written as a first part in a series, so it doesn't quite stand up as a good book on its own. If it had been a trilogy, I might have thought it interesting enough to read the other two volumes, but this book was definately not good enough for me to want to continue for more than ten more volumes."
5,Punky Doodle,"Left Behind: a Novel of Earth's Last Days starts with the occurance of the Rapture, the disappearances of all believers of Christ. A group of left behind people with an unknown relation to each other band together to fight against the Antichrist after learning about why all of these people vanished. Rayford Steele, an airplane pilot, connects with his daughter, Chloe, and his missing wife's pastor, Bruce. He and the group eventually meet Buck, a reporter for a magazine company. This book, whether you are Christian or not, with have an emotional, long-lasting effect on you and will leave you racking your brain to find out more!"
5,Left Behind makes you become more aware,"I enjoyed this book so much. It made you really think about what happens when the Lord really does come and how he will come. It's a real eye opener about life and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. Enjoy, be prepared, and pray you are ready..."
1,worst book ever,"This is the worst book I have ever read! The lack of proper grammar, the poorly formed and ridiculous plot line and horribly constructed characters . . . This is one of the worst books ever and I barely made it past the first 100 pages. Not even worth the $0.00 it costs. Worst book ever, EVER!!"
3,Left Behind Through The Mark,"I've read all of the books through The Mark. As a Christian reading these books, I'm torn at what's a fair rating. Artistically, I'm not that impressed with the writing style. I found it hard to identify with any of the characters. The child-like behavior didn't convince me that these people were taking their situation seriously. Taking 8 books to reach the mid point of the tribulation was a bit much. This could have been accomplished with 3 books. Now I read there will be 12 books total for the entire ""Left Behind"" series. My recommendation...read this series if you're fascinated with end times bible prophecy...otherwise stay away."
3,More than just fiction.,"This is a very good book for Christians & non-Christians alike to read. The unfortunate drawback is that in order for you to fully understand the contents of the book, you have to have an idea of much of what is going on in the Bible, and what it says about the end times.With that aside, Left Behind is a story of what many believe will happen with the Christians at the onset of what is known as ""The Tribulation Period"", and the continuing story of those who thought they were Christians.If it only does one thing, it should make us re-examine our lives and discover which side of the Tribulation we will be on."
2,For a specific audience only,"Poorly written, this is a religious screed on the glories of blood, death and destruction for those who didn't believe the right religious nonsense during their lives. If you're a dominionist, you'll love it. If you don't love a sadistic god of blood, sacrifice, and eternal damnation, you'll hate it."
3,Left Behind,It is a fairly interesting story about the Rapture. The characters were pretty one dimensional. Typical 8th grade reading level type novel.
3,Bad Religion - Good Science Fiction,"You have to be very far right on the religious scale of thought to buy into the kind of God that would punish so many people.Perhaps you just need to believe only in the old testament God. Still, the story makes for a good read even if you don't buy into the far right wing unforgiving God described in the story."
5,AWESOME,A must read for everyone!! You will not want to put it down and will keep your interest thru out the entire series.
4,A wake-up call for the whole world!,"For Christians, who have the ""blessed hope"" of the Rapture, this book is entertaining and thought-provoking reading. It is one of our joys to imagine what our face-to-face meeting with our Lord in the air will be like. However, we mustn't forget the horrors that will be suffered by those 'left behind.' This book is a modern look at how some of the Bible's prophecies MIGHT come to fruition. And it should spur us on to greater evangelism so that no one will be left behind!"
2,Not exactly spine tingling,"I heard so much about this novel, maybe my expectations were too high. In all fairness, I just didn't find the writing of very high caliber, nor the characters, nor the overall development of the story and plot. Anyone who wants to experience a truly harrowing, credible account of Judgment Day ought to read THE LAST DAY, which is the finest such portrayal of The Last Days anyone has yet come up with. If you want to feel what it's like to be in the real presence of Divinity, this frightening but uplifting novel truly delivers the emotional charge that LEFT BEHIND simply doesn't. Unless I hear that this series gets better as it goes, I'm stopping here."
1,Trash,"If you wish to solidify your negative religious teachings about a vengeful, punishing god who inflicts cruel and unusual punishment on his children by all means read all of these books.If you have had enough of this, I would recommend the books Conversations With God and An Encounter With A Prophet, books designed to get rid of these primitive concepts of god and introduce you to God's unconditional love for his children."
1,Worse than awful.,"A book for only the fanatical, non-thinking, mystic. Sadly, Tim LaHaye's writing is almost as bad as his theology so it isn't even an entertaining read. It's scary that there are people out there who relate this hype to biblical truth. Don't buy it, don't buy it, don't buy it. In fact, don't even check it out of the library."
2,Corrupted with Evaneglizing,"This book sparked my curiosity when I found it by happenstance on Amazon. I have always been interested in apocalyptic tales, and this novel seemed to be a perfect fit, thats until I began to read it. This book is just an outlet for Born-Again Christians to convert those who havent found the 'light'. Although I am Christian, I found this book overbearing and preachy, attempting to show those lost heathens what will occur once the Rapture occurs. The book only focused on the turmoil caused by the Rapture for about two seconds, then it seemed life began to be normal again, which I felt was absurd. The characters are interesting though, and I would have continued with the series if the authors hadn't spent so much time preaching to me. If you want to read a briliant apocalyptic tale that has Christian themes but does not force them down your throat, read Stephen King's The Stand, a true masterpiece."
1,Even more wonderfully bad than I expected!,"Unbearably stupid and worthless as fiction. There is no description of anything, and this Antichrist person is constantly described as 'eloquent' instead of shown to be eloquent through his dialogue. The worldview of the authors and their fans is morally repulsive, shockingly ignorant and lacking in any kind of humanity or humility. If you have half a brain and enjoy being made sick by the stupidity of people who are little more than apes, read this book immediately. You will be squirming on your couch in teary-eyed hysterics."
3,"This one is the best of the series, but ....","This ""end of the world"" story is based on the Book of Revelations and is very intriguing. Don't forget Waco though -- there are other books in the Bible that merit study as well. The authors' theory of The Rapture was pretty brilliant actually, though I agree with the other reviewers who found the characters one dimensional and unbelievable. Disappointments are: 1) that this was to be a 7 book series, expanded now to 21 (greed?), each one getting worse and rehashing the early books to ""catch up"" the reader who did not read the earlier books (am I alone in finding this insulting?). Also, the books are in a (nice) large print on terrible quality paper and ragged margins, making it look like it was published by 7th graders. Ugh. I'd recommend this book, but absolutely would not recommend the series."
2,"""charismatic but lacking in fundamentals""","After reading the first 1/3, I thought it was charismatic but lacking in fundamentals. After finishing the book, this inclination was confirmed."
2,An oxymoron: fresh subject matter for fiction; weak plot!,"LEFT BEHIND would be better ""left behind."" Although the subject matter is certainly thought-provoking, the presentation is shallow and predicable. And the dialogue ""stinks."" My high school creative writing students develop stronger characters. The pilot's ""quick"" salvation is ludicrous, as is his relationship with his college age daughter. Just NOT believable. I do NOT intend to read the others in the series, even if my friend (who loaned me LEFT BEHIND) insists!"
2,"Plotline thin, characters and story predictable.","I applaud Tim LaHaye/Jerry Jenkins for introducing this subject as mass market intro to eschatology, however, the plotlines are thin and predictable and the characters need better development. I would recommend this book only if you are bored, and/or have no previous Biblical background."
4,Intense Novel of the Last Days!!!,"I don't know what it was about this story that made me react the way I did. While I don't consider this book preachy, it made me look at myself in a whole new light. Boy! Do I need to change! The story was intense and gripping, though some of the circumstances happened at a much quicker pace than they probably actually would (my only complaint)."
5,Left Behind surpasses them all.,Left Behind was an excellent choice to read and you should read it too. This was a book that I couldn't put down and I can't wait to read Tribulation Force.
5,The Ultimate in Reading,"This book was the most fascinating book I ever read. I could not put in down let alone think about it through out the day. I feel the authors, though this book is considered ficton, really get their point across of the end times. Only time will tell just how accurate they are. I have finished reading all their books and can't wait until the next one is published. I have told alot of people about these books, they are by far the best!"
5,couldn't put them down,"once i started reading this series, i couldn't stop. they are action packed, romatic, suspensful, and carry a profound message about what it means to be christian."
5,Truely captivating even if you are not a fiction fan.,"I was shcoked with the amount of attention this book demands. Even if you do not agree with all the doctrines written about in this book, you can find some truth. It will make even the faithful Christian take a step back and examine his/her personal relationship with the True and Living God. Iwould recommend this book to anyone who already has a sound doctrine in the Bible."
4,Deepened my understanding of Revelations!,"This book is a Biblically accurate, fictional account of the initial events in the ""endtimes"". It relates the most important aspects of the Biblical teachings in present day jargons and context. I found myself unable to put it down and immediately ordered the next book in the series. Interestingly, I can identify with every aspect of one of the characters as I am an airline captain. This book is an easy read and, yet, spell-binding. A must buy for every Christian or as a gift to a Christian or non-Christian friend."
5,"A work of fiction, but displays Biblical truths","This book makes the prophecies found in the Bible come to light. As a Christian, I know that the biblical facts will happen. The authors have written a facinating account of what is going to happen in the future. My hope and prayer is that people who read this work of fiction will find the truth, and seek Jesus in their own lives so they will not be ""Left Behind"". I know that those who are not Christians will need to learn what it will take to be included when Jesus does return.This series of books should be read by everyone. People who do not read the Bible, or who do not understand all of the prophecies, can read this book and have the truth of salvation spelled out for them in a easy to understand story. I pray that many will be saved through these books."
1,maybe he can string words together,but what a load of defacation. Just call me a hog and butcher me for bacon. See I can outwrite a fundamentalist any day any way with style. These religious poop heads are why god gave us bigger brain cases not ego to absorb the added protien as we evolved into meat and gut eaters. Ive got science and hes got a big book with god shrunk inside kind of like intel inside the pentium chips. Just unplug yourself and truth shall set you free.
4,This books makes you stop and think,I have read the first three books of the Left Behind Series. I have enjoyed this book the best. It makes you stop and review your spritual self (at least it has for me). I remember reading this book and I would find myself looking around and wondering who would be left behind if Christ came back right then. I have not ever studied or read Revelations that much. My knowledge of it has grown somewhat. I would read Left Behind and then I would read some of Revelations in my Bible. Lahaye and Jenkins did a good job in writing this book and keeping it in-line with scripture. I thouroughly enjoyed this book. Infact I have read it twice!!
5,AWESOME!,"I had vaguely heard of this series of books, but I didn't give it much thought untill I stumbled across them one day as I was browsing through the bookstore. I decided to give the first one a try and I am hooked! It was wonderful. The writing is excellent and the subject matter is extreamly thought provoking. I have a grandfather who is a Pentecostal minister and I went to a Catholic Highschool. So I have been surronded by those with a strong faith my whole life. I however had not given much thought to my own other than just trying to be ""good"". If you're looking for something that is just a ""good read"", then this book will definately satisfy. If you're stumbling along the road of faith in God and Christ, this is a wonderful book with many insights. It made me think long and hard about who I was and what I was giving up without exploring my faith."
5,Good Book,"This book is straight out of Revelation. Awesome book. It gives a great look for what is in store for the world according to the bible. We won't know exaclty what will happen until the time has come but it lends an excellent insight into what the book of Revelation says will happen. They are very gripping and should make any reader truly think twice about their salvation. After all, how can one truly be a christian if they don't even believe the bible? Hope to see you in heaven!"
5,A good introduction to a FANTASTIC series,"I was shocked to see that a few people had rated this book so low, but then I read that they hadn't gotten beyond the first book. Anyone who stuck with Star Trek: The Next Generation could tell you that sometimes the best series start off a little slow.I personally read the book in less than a day, which is rare for me. I didn't start reading until The Indwelling was already out and blew through all seven books in only about 20 days.It was a startling eye-opener for a rather back-slidden Christian who has since made a rededication of his life to Christ.If you find the first book a little slow, move on to the second right away. You won't regret it!"
3,"Interesting, but poorly written.","I would have given this introductory novel a higher rating except for the really uninspired writing. the story has potential, but I always get the feeling the authors don't credit the reader with much intelligence. The entire thing is held to such a simplistic level, it grows tiresome. A book I would recommend to any other readers who feel as I do is ""The Last Day,"" (Glenn Kleier, Warner Books). You will find it more challenging and vastly more interesting--quite an extraordinary tale of Judgment Day."
1,A Truly Awful Book,"I'm a big fan of Fred Clark, and his famous ""Left Behind Fridays"" in which he deconsturcts this book page by excruciating page. So I wanted to see if it was really as awful as he said. I shelled out a buck for a used copy and flipped through it. IT WAS TERRIBLE! Bad writing, laughable plot, stock characters... this baby's like a primer on How Not To Write.And the rest of the novels, and related spin-off series, seem like a decidedly un-Christian plot to cash in on millenialist hysteria. Though I'm biased, because I am in fact Jewish, I would recommend ""Murder in the Mikdash"" as overall a better portrayal of the Messanaic Era (if you must read such stuff)."
2,Scapegoating?,Is the Left Behind series an exercise in scapegoating non-believers in Tim LaHaye's definition of Christianity?I found Rene Girard's interpretation of the bible a lot more compelling an argument for what Judaism and Christianity have contributed to attitudes of open-mindedness and tolerance we take for granted in everyday life. (the audio cassette kit ISBN 0660184966 is an easy-to-listen-to overview of Rene Girard's ideas)
2,I have to say that the Spirit did not move me...,"...while reading this book. Part of the problem was the writing, which seemed more on the level of a young adult novel (and not a particularly well-written one), part was the lackluster characterization, and part was the fact that the story just wasn't very compelling. Two things in particular bothered me...(1) The relatively small disruption that the Rapture caused in the world, since people seemed to pick right up and carry on, as though nothing of import had happened.(2) The lack of power in the descriptions of various individual conversion experiences. I've done more spiritual soul searching when I started a diet than these people appear to do before repenting and accepting Christ.I also thought the names were pretty silly, as someone else noted, and that Nicolae was a boring villain. I won't be reading any of the sequels."
2,It's interesting.,"I am not a Christian and my friend lent me this book to read. 3 months later I was able to finish it. For me the book was not the kind that I couldn't put down but I would read it on the subway or in the bathroom. So whenever I was bored I would read it.The first chapters were very interesting when the disappearances began and all the commotion was going on. I thought the book was thought provoking. It made me think about what all those hardcore christians were going through thinking that the end of the world is coming.It hasn't converted me to Christianity but it had certainly enlightened me on ""Rapture."" As I read the past reviews, I would agree that this book is on a 6th grade reading level. I would not recommend buying this book but I would recommend that you check it out from your library.I enjoyed the book but would not shell out money for it. I might check out the video out of curiosity and if my friend has the rest of the series then I will borrow them from him."
5,Impossible To Put Down!,This book was so difficult for me to put aside. The characters are developed so well that you cannot wait to find out what happens next! LaHaye addresses the doubts and disbeliefs from those who remain on Earth after the rapture with a very realistic perspective. You cannot read this book and ignore the message!
5,Gripping!,This book will have you doing some serious soul searching. It's an exciting story that is biblicly accurate. I highly recommend it even if your a skeptic. A real page turner.
2,Bad writing,"This should be a story to keep you rapt with attention. But the writing is so, so bad that it's distracting. The characters are very shallowly developed. Little description to what's going on around the characters, and the description that IS provided is poor. Too much bad dialogue, it's like reading a George Lucas script. The only reason I gave this a couple stars is because the story line is enough to keep most reading to find out what the individual characters do. But I won't continue the series. Very disappointing."
5,An excellent portrayal of the start of the Tribulation.,"I hope nobody aver puts this book down. It is an excellent and accurate novel. My Pastor and I have studied the Tridulation in the Bible and have compared it to this book. Nobody can ever say that the authors never studied the topic before writting about it because the events in the novel; the disappearances, the chaos and violence, line up quite well with the facts in the Bible. So, if I were you i would get this book and find out for yourself exactly what I meen."
4,"Great Premise, Weaker Characters",The book was good enough to cause me to buy it's sequel..but..the characters are weak. I personally couldn't relate to them as well as some my other fiction favorites.
5,You won't be able to put this book down!,"This book was recommended to me by a work friend almost a year ago. Since then, I have passed my copy on to many people as well as purchased copies for others when I couldn't get a hold of my copy. The reason....It's fantastic! Everyone in the world, Christian or not, should read this book!I don't want to ruin it by telling you anything, but I will tell you, you won't be able to put it down!And the best news is...there are 3 more books that follow this one! Each of them is more exciting than the next!"
3,Good book if you're into religion,"This is a good book if you're interested in examining a fictitious look at how Revelation would come to fruition. I don't think it's for everyone though. It is slow, but picks up about 3/4 of the way through. Once I was finished, I was hooked. I've got to go on to Tribulation Force now to find out what happens to the people left behind."
4,"i like it, i like it",I think these are good. I don't believe pre-trib rapture though. No man knows the day or hour. Better safe than sorry. These would be really good for the man in your life. The kids series is good also. They have a different story going at the same time .These will make you think about where you will go after your body is dead. Hey ! That's a big deal !
4,A Pretty Good Read,"I'm pretty much a Christmas and Easter only church goer so I was a little hesitant about reading any ""Christian fiction."" It turns out you don't have to be a zealot to enjoy this book. While set against the backdrop of the Rapture and one view of the end-times, the biblical references and descriptions are much less involved than the detailed technical descriptions favored by the likes of Clancy and Crichton. The plot isn't overly deep but is developed enough to hold your attention and reading ""just one more page."" My interest in the church has been intrigued by this book and I hope the rest of the series contiues to do so. All in all a pretty good read."
2,Another bad example...,"...of a series getting hyped by Christians simply because it's ""Christian literature"".This series is written poorly. Characters are not developed well, the narrative is scattered, and the author seems to change his mind all the time about the way things are going to turn out.And no, I'm not condemning all Christian literature. But I cannot stand it when people get behind a book (or any work) whether it's good or not. This series is mediocre."
3,A good beginning to an interesting series.,"The entire Left Behind series is an interesting interpretation of the biblical prophesies of the end times. This series is not for everyone. This series has many faults. It is at times poorly written, at times repetitive, and more often than not insulting and preachy. Having said that, there are many good characters and enough excitement to offset the defecits. I would also recommend the full cast audio dramas. After listening to them, I have the voice of the character in mind while I read."
3,Tedious,"I was made aware of these books by devout Christians and believers in the Rapture. My curiosity got the better of me and I was able to get my hands on the first five books in the series.First few chapters are interesting, in a science-fiction sort of way.The characters are tedious with the same incessant message over and over again. Some books remind me of a preacher standing in front of his congregation. Carpathia makes a poor dictator, at least that is how he comes across to me. His evilness is very weak.That all being said, each book carries enough interest to make one continue in the series. The religious aspect does get very tedious, if one is not a believer. The writing is very simplistic in style. I like a little more meat to my bones. I will probably continue the series when I can find them. I suppose that says something."
5,Best book I have read in a long time.,"This book opened a gate for me to reading Christian Fiction. The books in this series are like potato chips, you just can't stop with one. I am going crazy waiting for the next one!"
1,Bloodthirsty soft-porn for Christian Millennialists,"Awful writing - on a par with the shock/horror pulp novels that showed depravity in the 50s and 60s, I thought I would at least give them the benefit of the doubt before consigning them to the literary scrapheap, after all, they might have a good yarn or a decent message hidden among the racy sex scenes and bloody descriptions of death and damnation... but no.These are a print version of a revivalist preacher giving the hell-and-damnation message to the faithful.No doubt the series will be a hit with the gun-totin' millennialists and their offspring, It supports all their worst fears while titillating those places they aren't really allowed to expose...Certainly not worth the mone, but in those survivalist backwaters where they isolate themselves while they wait in their compound for the rapture, they could be put to double-duty in the outhouse.If it were possible to give zero stars, I would have."
1,"Oh, Puhleease","I listened to this book on tape, having no idea what it was about when I downloaded it on to my MP3 player -- just something about the last people left on earth.And quickly, I was hooked! People *disappearing* from a jet flying peacefully across the Atlantic?But instead of some amazing, fascinating science fiction story unfolding (Michael Crichton's Time Line isn't half bad to listen to), it turns out the answer to the puzzle is . . . God willed it . . . and all the good people went to heaven but the bad people -- who seem perfectly good in most cases, except that one who had lust in his heart for a flight attendant -- were left behind. And wait -- I'm wrong! They *weren't* bad people, they just weren't *born again!*This is doubtless a very fine book for people who are born again, and eager to be reaffirmed in their faith that they are the chosen people, destined for an eternity of bliss.For evertone else: save your time."
5,Just the beginning of a great series!,"I love this book. If you've seen the movie, don't be fooled! It is actually really good. Of the series this one is not my favorite but that's saying something b/c I'd still give this one 5 stars. Don't get lost on Nicolae... they almost lost me there. Soul Harvest and Assassins are my favs... try 'em out..... it's worth it."
2,try something new!,"well intented but weak!the left behind series is slow and draining to anyone with an above average creative mind.i am a believer, and i do think that the series get's the point across but reading it is like beating a dead horse.don't get me wrong i liked it but after i read the ""christ clone trilogy"" by james beauseigneur i was blown away,devastated,floored,in awe.it is my opinion that this man, mr.beauseigneur!was bleesed with an amazing understanding of the bible and bible prophecy.the christ clone trilogy is x-citing and never a dull moment in any of the three books.if you like the left behind books .go and read the christ clone trilogy series,it will blow you way."
2,Judgment Day lite--,"If this is what's passing for a good read these days, we're all in serious trouble. Slow, dull, BADLY written, cliche-riddled, uninspired, draaaaagged out. Why does anyone waste time on such lightweight efforts when there are really excellent Judgment Day novels out there? If you haven't read Kleier's THE LAST DAY, you haven't read the best endtimes novel. It's a jewel. Also, King's THE STAND, while maybe not as much fun as LAST DAY, is still one of King's best works. Jenkins and Lehaye aren't in the same league."
5,Left Behind,Love this series. Makes you stand up and think about what is to come as a Christian and especially if you are not a Christian. I LOVE JESUS!!!
3,Good Horror Novel,I am an atheist and believe religion is used by mankind as a control device. This series proves my point. I do find the book as a decent horror novel (not Stephen King good). With the seven years of [horror] on earth to come it may prove to be a good series...
1,You are all quite quite mad,"You are all out of you minds. If this is how God behaves, he is too. This is appalling Right Wing drivel designed to convince inadequates that they are better than the rest of us.Throw this book away."
4,very compelling,"I loved the book and hope it sends a message to many who do not have a clue about Revelations because many mainstream churches do not wish to address this book of the bible. My own, included. I do think the airline part was quite phony, especially the flight attendant portion. It seems that everyone uses flight attendants as examples of corruption. As a flight attendant myself, I tire of this. I wish my husband did not have to endure the looks and smirks behind such assumptions when folks discover he is married to one. I am a christian who hopes this book and others that followed will bring us to realize that we need to expecially address our youth problem. I have 3 older children and pray for them daily. It's difficult out there."
5,Breathtaking! The desire to follow Christ is overwhelming!,"In LEFT BEHIND, readers clearly experience the anxiety and heartbreak of the family members when they realize their loved ones have been taken in the Rapture. The anguish they experience when they realize they were told the truth is gut-wrenching, but the readers heart will rejoice as they become dedicated to Christ and begin to spread the Gospel to others. Clearly explained, life after the Rapture is not a true life at all, only pure survival."
4,TAKE IT FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH,"I thought this was a nice, simple start of a long tedious story about the end of the world. I agree it is not the best written novel out there, but it will do.Granted, I thought it was a little too far fetched, what with the moving of the U.N. to Babylon, and the one currency being pondered over, for as much as it was.But is it fiction, and that means you should try to suspend disbelief. I am actually very eager to see how this will turn out, I won't flock to the stores for the next installments. But if I'm shopping and I should come across the next volume, I'll give it look see."
1,"I read this book, in general.","After reading the first 50 pages of this book I began to seriously wonder what all the hype was about; I finished it anyway. It is somewhat of a good idea, but this book was not written for an intellegent audience. Someone had to write a new inspirational book for our generation, seeing as how nothing overly relgious had been popular lately, but the fact that this book is religious is possibly the only reason it is so popular. Aside from the simply sentence structure and the vocabulary based at the 8th grade level, this book jumped around far too much to keep a decent plot at all. I certainly hope it's sequel's are better."
4,Re-release With New Content,"They are re-releasing the Left Behind 12 book series in paperback form with new covers.Left Behind is the first book of an end times series dealing with The Rapture and what happens in the world afterwards.While all of the books are easy reads (it doesn't take much brain power to slice through them), this first book was probably my favorite.You are introduced to the now-familiar characters: Rayford, Chloe, Nicholae, and Buck.The story picks up moments before Christians are raptured to heaven.Something added to this edition is new content in the back. You will read how current events have tied in with the fiction portrayed in this series. Each book has this new feature at the end.This book was provided for review, at no cost, by Tyndale Publishing."
1,An interesting beginning...,"People vanish from a 747 aloft, babies disappear from their mothers' wombs, drivers from their cars, causing widespread panic on earth. As I read more, this book became a thinly couched venue for arrogant fundemantalist Christian rhetoric. God will not save you unless you believe in Christ and his teachings. Primitive writing and a repetitive plot, I can't imagine reading all 12 tomes. Rapture indeed. I'll end up here on earth; a Roman Catholic with all the rest of the Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, etc. The world might be a better place."
2,maybe not..,"What I thought was a science fiction that might be interesting turned into nothing more than a thinly disguised bible thumping marathon. I wanted good sci-fi, not a preacher."
1,WOW! Worst book ever written.,"Can you rate something 'Zero' stars? I read about 30 pages, hoping it would get better. It only got worse. Who reads this simplistic crap? The target audience seems to be 5th graders."
1,It's just bad,"You know how some books are great and others are terrible? Well this is one of those terrible books. I don't know how I can describe how bad it is, other than that it feels like it was written by an overzealous, Christian 13-year-old who wanted to write about the rapture. All the ""good"" Christians go to Heaven while all other forms of life are ""left behind?"" Yeah. Please get a college education and THEN write a book. Not the other way around.Avoid at all costs."
2,About the most boring story I've ever read.,"This story drags on with details of little or no real importance or value. The characters are drab and the literary quality is about as shallow as a Western or Romance novel. While the subject and premise of the story are interesting to consider, the delivery is geared for the simple reader. I read it after The De Vinci Code. It was like going from the theater to a grade school play. If it weren't for its theocratic orientation, I couldn't imagine how this book could have any popularity. Thoroughly unentertaining."
3,"It's interesting, but that's about it","Left Behind (and it's sequels) are interesting, but like many others, I have to admit that the quality of the writing makes me wince. Also, don't base your view of prophecy and the last days on these books. First of all, they're fictional. Secondly, they're completely biased. Check out scripture for yourself, and read as many differing opinions as you can. Do your own research; don't just take someone else's word for it."
1,Can I get an amen!,"After hearing about the subject matter of this book, I was looking forward to reading the entire series. I changed my mind after about ten pages. The mood of the book was condescending and preachy. And the writing was the literary equivalent of USA Today. Skip this unless you're a mindless follower looking for validation."
1,A formula novel!,"The authors attempt to engage by use of a format that has proven to attract readers. There are far better books that deal with the same basic subject of survival after a global catastrophe. What distinguishes this one is the attempt to provide a religous message. Both the story and message are simplistic, and the theology involved is so banal as to be offensive. This is a formula book, and is neither creative nor well written."
3,"Hard to put down, but not the be all, end all","I am actually about 3/4 of the way through the first book. A Christian friend at work loaned it to me to read. I have found it very difficult to put down, but I also agree that the characters are weak and the storyline jumps about too much. I am not a Christian myself, and this book has not compelled me to rush out and ""find Christ"". I find it an entertaining, easy-to-read work of fiction about the end of the world. I'm glad I'm borrowing the books in the series from a friend, though. I wouldn't spend my own money on them."
1,I didn't want a 400+page Bible study guide.,"I must admit, the first 120 pages held my interest without exception -and then the preaching hit. If I wanted to buy a Bible study guide, I would have done so. Notes on the back of the book read ""More gripping than Clancy."" Who.....Dan Clancy?"
1,Harhar!,"I must admit, these reviews are all quite amusing. If any of you want to see a truly powerful, compelling, and thought-provoking treatment of the end-of-the-world, whether you are a religious person or not, check out the Japanese anime NEON GENESIS EVANGELION."
1,Feeding Fear and Psychosis,"I am a therapist. I deal with psychotics, child abusers and chemically dependent clients on a daily basis. Most of the psychotics, many of my chemically dependent clients and almost all of the child abusers I see have the same core religious belief systems embellished by these books. This belief system is probably the largest single obstacle to any meaningful recovery for these people.Congratulations to the authors and the outspoken fans of this series. Your combined efforts have set us back in the treatment mentally illness, chemically dependency and child abuse by at least fifty years."
1,Fundamentalist anti-intellectualism rears its ugly head,"I find it disturbing when people try to make the Bible into something more than ancient Hebrew mythology. This book is rife with anti-intellectualism and mental banality. Notice how the airline pilot and the respected journalist and the skeptical college student are all ""left behind"" while the simple housewife is ""raptured"". This drivel is written on about a 4th grade reading level and is clearly intended for simple housewives and not respected journalists. Do yourself a favor and read some authors who prize and respect feats of the mind and not blind faith in invisible gods."
2,"Copied storyline, anti-Catholic bias, banal, shallow","To thoes that think, they will see that this is slick marketing of anti-Catholic bias. Right up there with Loraine Boettner Lahaye and Jenkis let thier bias show. Lahaye a graduate of Bob Jones--known for anit-Catholic teaching is pushing an agenda and getting rich doing so--orginally this was a 3 book series, think how much more you can make off of more books, tapes, CDs, tee-shirts, video, etc...... If you want a good read go to Bud Macfarland's books. By the way the story line for Left Behind is not orginal they stole it: Salem Kirbin's 666--Why he did not sue is the big question."
1,Only for Ignorant Fundamentalist Cave Dwellers,"I read this book just so I could make an attempt to understand why it's so popular. Basically, it plays of ignorant peoples fears of a biblical ""end of times"" scenario, where all the evil unbelievers are ""left behind"" to suffer god's wrath (you know, because he loves us!). Anyhow, it is written at about a 4th grade level and has the substance of a Hardy Boys adventure. (Actually, that's unfair to the Hardy Boys.) Anyhow, hundreds of years from now anthropologists will dig up one of these books thus hypothesizing that the 20th Century was a time of widespread imbecility and ignorance, a time when knuckle-draggers took up far to much space and breathed in far too much valuable air. A monkey alone in a room with a type writer could churn out something more substantive. If you read this crap, you should be embarrassed; not just for yourself, but for humanity, of which, unfortunately, you are considered a part of."
2,"Makes ""Celestine Prophecy"" look like War & Peace","I bought this book based on its potentially exciting plotline and put it down 50 pages in. I've since picked it up and finished it so that it wouldn't be a total waste of money. The characters are poorly developed, the choices they make are obvious and simple. The plot is so transparent that you can see through it. The book is amateurish and excessively preachy. I won't be spending any money on the other books in this series."
3,Great Idea occasionally marred by sophmoric writing,"If you're someone who reads alot and enjoys an occasional challenge when you read, this book may not be the one for you. By taking the Book of Revelations, and creating a fictional story revolving around the second coming of Christ, the writers have come up with a great idea. Unfortunately, the characters never really go beyond cardboard two dimensional cutouts who only seem to serve as instruments to further the plot, and the dialogue I wouldn't wish on the best of actors to try and make work.However all that said, if you can accept these shortcomings, and are interested in prophesy and the book of Revelations you may enjoy this book."
1,12 volume pile of dung,"Blah blah blah. Boring, predictable. Generic Shallow characters. Reading this was like visiting the dentist from hell. It is horrid and I only read this cause somebody gave it to me. on its own it is utter crap. The only reason people read these is because it involves god and a silly notion of the future. This book has no flow, no style, no surprises.it makes me puke. if you want to read works of art read harry potter books"
1,Couldn't get past bad writing,"I consider myself a pretty tolerant reader, but I didn't get past the first 30 pages of this book because it was SO BADLY written. The dialogue is inane, the characters not realistic, and the plot unbelievable. For instance, one character lives in a trailer park and usually her parents get drunk and rowdy on the Friday night dances. One Friday, a preacher comes and says a few words before the music, and Vicki's father is on his knees with tears streaming down his face, ready to accept Jesus into his heart. I'm insulted by the high-handed writing in this book to try to convert the sinners of the world...before it's too late. Well, it's too late to get my time back from reading this book, but it's not too late for you shoppers. Don't buy this book."
1,Pretty bad writing,"I've always been interested in books and movies that focus on Revelations (easily the most over interpreted book in the Bible). I had high hopes for this one, but it was a letdown. The fact that it is featured prominently in Christian bookstores should be a big indicator that the authors have an axe to grind, and they do so with very limited ability at writing compelling fiction. The characters are stilted and unbelievable - you develop not the slightest empathy for them. The dialogue is just as bad. The book caters to those who believe in Revelation literally rather than as a possible allegory. They should love this book - I did not."
5,Deep insight to a confusing book in the Bible,"When ""Left Behind"" hit the shelves, I was hesitant to read a book about a book in the Bible. When I opened the cover and starting reading, it caught me in its grasp and held my interest until the very last page. Because of this novel (the entire series) I have started to really look closely at the book of Revelation and start thinking more closely about the future and being ready for Jesus' return. I'm ready, are you?Loved it, you should buy it now!"
4,Left Behind,"Having read Left Behind on the recommendation of a fellow Christian, I found the message of the book exceptional. It encourages true Christians to try harder and the non-Christian to make a decision. I can also see it as a useful handbook for those who will be ""left behind"". The only reason I gave it 3 1/2 - 4 stars was because of the terrible writing. I found myself re-reading passages in order to make sense out of what the author/s were trying to express. It's a good book for the message it's sharing with the rest of the world, but the 10 million copies sold cannot be attributed to the writing skills of the authors. It's still worth picking up and reading."
3,so many Christians?,"Is it just me or did anyone else think it was so odd that so many people disappeared from the Earth? While I never got a count, it seems it was a substantial number to cause so much chaos. however, by the guidelines the authors set forth to qualify as a real Christian, I seriously doubt more than 1 percent of the Earth would be welcomed into Jesus's loving arms."
4,Must Read,"Left Behind is an excellent book if you don't read to much into it. Iloaned out this book, (I thought it was a great read, when viewed onlyas a story) and the person I loaned it to, found so many people disturbed by the book or looked to much at it as a re-write of Revelation, they decided not read it. That really was to bad. This is not the bible. It was the author's way of interpeting how they thought the rapture might happen, using a specific character for you to relate to. For those of you who found it shallow or elementary, to bad for you. It was a great story. Remember no one can change your religious beliefs people, unless you allow them to."
5,It's Wake Up Time,"If you think it is time for you to wake up and notice the last book of the bible read this book ""Left Behind"". Do not just read the first book, read the whole series. These books will make you realize what is going to happen some day soon. The book contains actual excerts from the bible and it will make you want to pick up your bible and start reading it again. It is not a depressing book by any means. Alot of poeple have told me they do not want to read the book because it would be depressing. Well I am here to tell you it is not depressing at all. It is a fictual account of what happens to some people when they are left behind after God comes and takes the chosen people. Please read all the books, you will love them, I am sure of it!"
5,A must read for anyone interested in the last days!,"I thouroughly enjoyed this book! Every time I picked it up, I had a hard time putting it down. The detail is so enthralling and captivating. It literally will scare the ""hell"" out of anyone. The last days are here, and this book shows what we're up against if we are left behind. I thank God that He gave me the opportunity to be at home with Him rather than facing the Tribulation."
5,A review,"You are on a plane and all of a sudden your child disapears right before your eyes! This is what happens to many people in the book, Left Behind. Follow Rayford and Buck's adventures as they go through the most shocking event in history. As the plot thickens, they are facing trials, ones that are a matter of life or death, such as being decieved by the Anti-christ. I recommend this book to the reader who enjoys inspiration titles. But, to the ones who don't, they may get bored. This book was very well written, with great personalities, such as Hattie Durham and Nicloae Carpathia. Tim Lahaye and Jerry B. Jenkins have outdone themselves once again."
5,Wonderful,I loved this series during the first publishing. Something this wonderful never grows old. Each book in this series just gets more amazing. Please remember this is a Christian book. Non-Christians will not find enjoyment in reading this book or the series.
3,Too many books in the series,"How many books are in this series? I think its 10--maybe more if we keep buying them. This is an exciting read for the first few books, then one adventure sounds much like the ones in the previous books. The Christian aspect of the story did not offend me. I can appreciate the value of a good story line, and the rapture certainly lends itself to exciting fiction.I was home for a few weeks and read every book up to ""The Mark"". However, I am disappointed that the story is dragging out so long. I feel these ""Christian"" authors are taking advantage of the buying public and milking the success of their first few books by dragging it out. I resent this kind of marketing ploy. At this point, I don't care what happens, I won't read another one."
5,Indescribable,"No words can describe how exciting this series is. It's good clean reading, definitely fast-paced and it will have you waiting impatiently for the next book. It also makes you check your bible and your salvation."
5,Fantastic! Fiction? It's the Book of Revelation come alive!,"This book really gives you an idea of what this earth is about to experience...the Rapture of the Church...(.the disappearances of millions of Christians upon the earth). They really do a great job bringing the Book of Revelation alive. The next book just gets better...Tribulation Force...a must read book too..and then there is Nicolae, and Soul Harvest. Can't wait until the movie comes out that they are going to film hopefully next year! I'm a flight attendant with a major airlline and so many people are reading this book...everyone from businessmen, to college students...etc. It's a must read book!"
4,Suspenseful Christian Reading!,"Left Behind is a suspenseful work that will make you reevaluate your thoughts on the end times. We follow the lives of four people left behind after Jesus raptures his church. We learn of the heartache of losing family and friends in a blink of the eye. How will they go on? How will it effect their thoughts on religion? The pace of the book will keep you from putting it down. It also will leave you wanting more. Thankfully there is more, this is only the beginning of a seven book series. I have read 3 so far and am anxiously awaiting to read the next."
2,I'm left behind,"As a conservative Christian who takes prophecy pretty seriously, I was disappointed that Jenkins and LaHaye didn't take enough time to explain in depth the Bible evidence for the rapture theory. Perhaps they were preaching to the choir but it left behind those of us who are unfamiliar with or disagree with their concept of the end times. Aside from 2 or 3 actual scripture references or allusions we simply have to take their word for it. They had plenty of opportunity even in a novel to let the Bible speak for itself without slowing down their plot."
1,You either love it or hate it.,"You're either going to enjoy the suspense or you're going to hate the simplicity of this book. As for me, I had to force myself to keep reading because it was too late to do a report on another book. I(being a Christian for almost 9 years now, with my basic bible knowledge plus) think the author has left a few important things out. No trumpet, nothing to make us want to read the other books in the series, and the author strays off the subject a little too often to name a few things that the author did. Some of the plot is too easily predicted, but personally, this book doesn't come close to satisfying me. Keep in mind though that this is my opinion and you may completely disagree with me and love this book.END"
1,Almost good enough for the juevenile category.,"Biblical prophecy is a fascinating and controversial topic. There is nothing more exciting to the believer than speculation about the endtimes and the advent of Christ's return. And that is the only reason I can think of that explains the success of the Left Behind Series. If you are a fan of great literature, be prepared to be disappointed with the weak characterization, corny dialogue, and juevenile sentence structure. If you are a student of eschatology, be prepared to be disappointed in the total lack of scriptural backing. If you just love to read an interesting story, are able to overlook any intellectual aversions, and don't mind the fact that the conclusion of the series with book 12 is only ""speculated"", you might enjoy this. Otherwise, save your money."
4,Wonderful,"A wonderfully book, written to accomadate all educational levels. IT truly puts the second coming into modern day circumstances. It is written not only for Christians but for non-believers as well. Some people fail to relize however that it is only one interpretation of Revelation and there are many many different theories and interpretations."
5,Amazing Reading!!,"It only took me two days to read the first five books of this series, I read the last two on the day they came out. They were absolutely amazing! Now I am anxiously awaiting the eighth book, The Mark.I normally read Tom Clancy and the like, so this was a bit of a change. What a welcome change! I was stand-offish about the biblical subject matter at first, but I am glad that didn't stop me. They are very easy to read, but they are hard to put down.If you are a Christian, this is a great way to learn more about the sometimes obscure writings in Revelations, and give you pause to address your own faith. Whether or not you agree with this version of the book of Revelations, the story is still compelling!If you are not a Christian and you enjoy action adventure books, this is definitely worth the time!"
5,Completed my set,I had the complete set of the Left Behind series but failed to get the first book back from a person who borrowed it. That is fine with me because it is probably still being circulated to friends. I ordered this book to replace that one.
1,Don't take the bait.,"Word to the wise - don't start this series. This is a package deal. A very....very long series. The first couple are ok, but I promise you, the further you get in the more frustrated you will become until you feel completely cheated. This was originally intended to be a seven book series, tops. The authors started making money and the charlatans milked it for all it's worth. Get used to reading the same things over and over again. Get used to superfluous space filling (stalled) plot lines. If you choose to dive in, remember, I told you so."
1,"""high literature"" for fifth grade readers","I read Left Behind to get a better understanding of what a politically powerful group of Americans is reading. It was a quick easy read. Without being too cynical, it was written with a depth and simple style that undoubtedly appeals to the target audience of fundamentalist Christians who want their belief in the Rapture validated. I am sure it is considered ""high literature"" by those who like to read fifth grade fiction. I would characterize it as biblical plagiarism by financially opportunistic writers with minimal writing skill.Don't waste your time or money on this book. It is an insult to serious readers."
1,Christians beware,"As a Christian I decided that a Christian theme book would be an interesting read. However, I've been greatly disappointed in the entire series. I've gotten to Nicolae, and can't get through it. Most disturbing I've found subtly woven attacks on Catholics and a direct attack on the nature of the main Jewish character introduced early in the book. When the Jewish man tries to convince the reporter to pay for his time, his cabfare, etc....come on.....why doesn't the book just be racist and call him a ""cheap Jew?"" I'm not Jewish and I found this highly disturbing. Beware true Christians. Christian's don't weave hatred for others into their lives or their writings. Besides, do you think God would be happy having two authors write a book based on Revelations, where the Anti-Christ is patterned after Dracula, and is dating a flight attendant? Give me a break. Everyone, back to your faith!"
2,Book order,Great condition but I ordered a hardback copy instead of paperback. Didn't get a response from my email about the mistake.
3,Compelling plot makes up for weakness in style,"Left Behind and its sequels flesh out the prophecies found in the book of Revelation. The last years of the earth before Christ's second coming are brought to life through the personal experiences of an assortment of people who decide to get serious about their religious faiths after realizing they have been ""left behind"" by friends and loved ones who disappeared from the mortal world on Day One of the end times. These books are not skillfully written. The authors describe without being descriptive; they create characters who seem stiff and contrived; much of the human interplay is simply too pat to grip the reader's interest. Yet, the sheer intensity of the unfolding events makes this book too good to miss. Its fidelity to Bible prophecy, in a 1990's setting, pushes disappointment in its literary quality aside and involves the reader in the narrative. This series is worth reading quite simply because it is important work."
4,Well thought out story with a few problems.,"The authors have a great story. They have wonderful characters that you want to care for, but the way the story is written they seem shallow. There are a few technical problems in the story, and while everyone has some profession or is college educated, at times they seem kind of dumb. Now while I have said the characters are shallow, the story is really good. The authors should treat the characters like real people. Can't wait for the next installment."
4,a very good read!,"I was wondering whether to give this book 4 or 5 stars and finally opted for 4 because there are some flaws. I didn't find the initial characterization part particularly interesting, and Chloe's reluctance to accept Christ dragged on too long.On the positive side the pace picks up and it's an exciting, fun ride! I thought the Nicolae character is quite nicely constructed. Everything about him seemed so ""good""! The idea of the series going on for 12 volumes seems a bit excessive, I bet they will have run out of steam by the 5th or 6th book. The Lord of he Rings only spanned 3 books, C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia only 7 short books, so I don't see why this series should span 12 books!Having said all that, I can't wait to read Tribulation Force, I look forward to reading at least a couple more volumes! :)"
1,"Oh, honestly","I'm not even sure how to categorize this book. It purports to be fiction, but clearly takes itself a good deal more seriously than that. I suppose the genre it most closely fits into would be sci-fi. Taking it as sci- fi then, let me say the story bored me, the characterizations are weak, and the writing mediocre at best.For those who don't think the story is sci-fi but some sort of End of Days prophecy...well, who knows. Just about anything could be true, I suppose, including a nasty God. I can only say: Please don't doom me to an eternity spent with the characters in this book; I'd much rather just go quietly into that good night.I give the book one star only because it took some effort to type, I guess. (Leaving zero stars for those who don't do the assignment at all.)"
2,I just couldn't care...,"I struggled through this first one but I won't be going to the next book. I had an impossible time caring about these characters. I wanted to care, but I just couldn't.Life and theology lend themselves to good story-telling; the best stories are representations of universal themes. I just couldn't find that here...and I am very familiar with the background material."
1,Deeply troubled,"And so it begins, the ""Left Behind"" series, the single most disturbing publishing phenomenon of the last decade. I sell books for a living, and when Lahaye's little project began, I chuckled as I skimmed the book, wondering who on earth this half-baked mix of Tom Clancy and Pat Robertson could really be sold to. Several years and half a dozen bestsellers later, I'm not laughing. Are people so desperate for a gaudy, sensationalistic fantasy saga that they'll swallow any amount of religious propaganda? Or is America really filled with this many fanatical bigots? The other day I sold one of these books to a clearly homosexual man, apparently eager to read it, and I just had to stare at him in wonder. Don't you know, I wanted to ask him, that these people HATE you? That they think you'll be condemned to eternal suffering? It just proves my Bookselling Motto: people will read anything, unless it's any good."
1,"Am I crazy, or is this a knockoff of Stephen King's Book?","When I first ready Left Behind, I thought it was the most creative, original storyline I had read in years--after reading four books in the series, I lost interest. Surprise! Surprise!Are these authors (Tim & Jerry) ""sampling"" or what? Stephen King's ""The Landoliers (book & movie) has the identical storyline. No, it doesn't tie it to a Biblical pretext, but the core story of people disappearing from airline--leaving behind teeth, wigs, dental work, etc. is same. So much for originality. Is there a pending lawsuit?"
1,Awful,"Never mind the insane theology; as a novel this is absolutely dreadful. The characters are as three-dimensional as a carbon nanotube, the plot is outlandish and bears no relation to reality - Israel salvages six years' worth of fuel from crashed Russian aircraft which have already been described as crashing in flames? Oh really? - and the quality of research is embarrassing. I lost any remaining respect for the authors (which by that point was already low) when the intrepid journalist's Scotland Yard contact started talking about his boss the captain. No British police force has, or ever had, the rank of Captain, and it would have taken all of five minutes to find that out. Well, if the authors couldn't even be bothered to do that level of basic research, I'm not going to bother reading any more of their books."
1,There MUST be better reads on subject out there!,"Fictional treatments of prophetic end-times aren't so rare, but stories that also aim to impart a genuine sense of the act of spiritual salvation and confession are rare indeed. If this is what you want, ""Left Behind"" will simply leave you behind.This is cardboard fiction. The writing is careless, thoughtless and un-illuminating of either character or spiritual drama. A good author manages to evoke senses and emotions experienced by the characters; lazy writing explicates storyline without involving the reader on whit. Such is the sorry endeavor of ""Left Behind"".The action packed end-times struggle covered in the subsequent 17 (!) books may be quick summer reads, but any comparison to Tom Clancy is out of line.This is vapid, cardboard Leave-it-to-Beaver drama that doesn't cut it. There has to be better out there"
3,It was OK,"I am a christen, however let me just say that the characters are wooden and dialogue and plot are almost nonexistent. Now from a strictly theological standpoint it does have merit but that is not enough to save it. It does not help spread the message of Jesus in any way, it only helps spread the Fire and Brimstone approach that is so prevalent in some areas of this country. No one is going to read this book and be converted or filled with holy zeal. Christians like myself will pat themselves on the back because they are going to heaven and the unchurched will laugh and call us ""ignorant fudentalists""."
2,"Great topic, great ideas, but poorly written","I love the premise of these books. I love the idea of getting a glimpse of one possible end of the world. But who came up with these characters? No one in these books behaves like a real person at all. Do the authors really think that if millions of people disappeared into thin air that the rest of the world would go on business as usual; continuing to work, travel, and maintain order? I beg to differ. There would be looting, suicides, chaos, distruction and pandemonium everywhere. For me, the books are just too unrealistic."
3,So so...,"I am not crazy about this series. The writing style is mediocre, and I felt no sense of the Holy in reading it. It gives a limited view of the Last Days, a view which is not shared by all religious scholars. However, with that said, I think this book and the whole series can be useful in understanding many of the symbols used by St. John when he wrote Revelation. It can be useful in getting people interested in reading the Bible. Readers should not think, though, that this series completely explains Revelation. It is, rather, a story of how some of the prophesies may one day come to pass."
4,Review of Left Behind,"I am really not a reader, in fact I really don't like reading at all. I was just cruising through a book store one day and just on a spur of the moment I decided I wanted to get a book. So I walked over to the Christian section and picked up the first book I saw (Left Behind). This book captured my attention right from the beginning and I didn't put it down for about 2 hours. Being a new Christian myself, I didn't know a lot about the Rapture, but this book made it very clear. The book takes place in the not so distant future with makes it kind of scary to read. If you are a believer, you begin to think of everyone you know who could be ""left behind"" if God raptured his church this very day. If you aren't a believer, it will quickly convince you that this could be a reality any day. I definitely recommend this book to anyone."
3,..Interesting reading,"After noticing a friend reading ""Tribulation Force""(Book 2 in the Left Behind Series) I decided to pick it up. I willadmit, I am not a religious person, and was prepared to ""shut out"" any religious overtones that I picked up in the book.But, to be honest, I was more pulled into the storyline of the book. Though slow at times and a bit too quick in other parts. I could see myself recommeneding the series to someone else. If you are interested in a thoughtout series, they this could be the one for you."
4,A call to be ready!,"I very much enjoyed this book. I've spoken with several people who have recommitted themselves to the Lord after reading this series. I shared my book at work and had a waiting list of 4 & 5 people at a time. It is very easy to read and makes you want more. It is quite hard to put down. You don't have to agree with the authors pretribulation theology to enjoy these books, no matter when or if you believe the church is going to be raptured, this book makes you want to be sure that you are ready for Christ's imminent return! Are you ready?"
1,"Bad writing, thin characters","I got the book because I was interested to see how someone might fictionalize the book of Revelations. But the writing was so bad and the characters so thin, that it was hard to get through."
1,A didactic disappointment,"I purchased this book as a gift for my (unsaved) husband and am very disappointed by the lack of subtlety. This book is clearly intended to, ""preach to the choir"" and not to provide an entertaining read to audiences at large. The writing is mediocre."
1,Readers Left Behind on Left Behind,"I really wanted to like this book. I thought the subject matter sounded interesting. Unfortunately I found the book lacking in just about everything, including good writing. On the one hand there are descriptions of how, with the disappearances of millions of people, there is social chaos with looting and blocked traffic. On the other hand a character is flying all over the world with no problem. It seems as if the two authors wrote their own sections and never successfully integrated them into a coherent story. I found getting through the book to be an unhappy experience and I wiil avoid any further books from either of these gemtlemen. Left Behind? Leave it behind!"
1,Only a few howlingly funny scenes to relieve the boredom,"I was hoping to recommend this as high camp. Unfortunately, although there are a couple of moments of laugh-out-loud hilarity, most of LEFT BEHIND is so tedious and gawdawful that it's not worth mining for unintentional humor.Recommended for cultural anthropologists. Others can get a summary by watching the movie, available in the bargain bin at Wal-Mart."
4,Politicized Ratings Abound,"No need here for another synopsis, rather a few words on the widely varying reviews. This isn't 'great literature' nor the finest whatever. What it is is a very interesting read with a fascinating premise. Those of you offended by any positive take on religion probably can't enjoy this. The book could reasonably be reviewed at 3-4 stars based on quality and certainly similar level books are often 'generously' rated at 5 stars by many of the more enthusiastic folks out there. But the 1 and 2 star reviews merely reflect the political 'axe to grind' anti-christian attitudes manifested by a ever growing crowd who apparently are more than ready to bring back book burning and perhaps their own modernized version of the Inquisition. Enjoy!"
3,Left Behind: Based on Dispensationalism,"The book Left Behind is FICTION. The series of events depicted in Left Behind is based on a theology called Dispensationalism. The rapture (which is a key theme in the book)is a key element of this theology that is less than 200 years old.The book is good fiction and is the first in a series that moves through fictional events. Since it is a book that is based on dispensationalist theology, it's theological credibility is questionable.Owen"
3,Decent Thriller-Style Novel,"When you strip the religious overtones of the book out, it reads like a decent thriller. The pages turn quickly, and you find yourself easily identifying with the characters of the story. Add in the religious overtones, and the book gets a bit preachy in places, but it doesn't detract from the overall plot of its thriller under-tones. Good book, worth the time in flipping through the pages."
2,"Weak writing, and very preachy","This book almost makes me embarassed to be a Christian. The writing is insipid, the constant preaching is tiresome, and the characters don't even begin to be believable. The other annoying thing is their trick of printing the book with huge margins, ultra-wide spacing, and large print. This was obviously just a trick to stretch 200 pages into 500. They'd have done better to combine this one with the next one in the series and save a few trees. If you're curious about the series, check it out from the library before you waste your money!"
1,A joke,"Simplistic religious propaganda designed to manipulate and frighten. It's funny that folks who espouse the Rapture and attendant details as expressed in these books style themselves as ""biblical fundamentalists"" who take the Scriptures literally. This Rapture dogma is cobbled together from various vague references which are all taken out of context. All this is is a blatant attempt to scare you into joining up with them. Don't fall for it. Use the reason God gave you."
1,Warning Warning Warning Warning Warning Warning,"I purchased this book solely based on the overwhelming 5 star ratings...I love a good work of fiction on those long airplane rides...Little did I suspect that this support comes from people who REALLY believe that this work is a probable non fiction outcome of the teachings/prophesies of the Bible. It is a ridiculous book not worth your time unless you want to see an updated ""Ten Commandments"" in book form."
1,not even close to bibical.,"this is being ignorantly used as a tool of evil. there, i said it.and YES, i am a christian.fear is not a tool that should ever be used to love folks into the kingdom."
1,BORING,"not to be too harsh, but if you read all the ""good"" reviews below, you've basically read the book. I am always up for a good book that continues on with others. I did not buy it from religous perspective, but as a novel to hopefully lead to buying the second one, third, etc. NOT! The story line repeats itself over and over and over and over and...started out ok but lost interest very quickly...too bad, could have been an excellent story line."
4,Pretty Good,"At first,I was reluctant in reading this book since I'm not Christian and also I have some issues with so-called Christians today. Although I have not read Book of Relevations for awhile, I have to say that this book made me look at life differently. At the same time, it didn't make me change my mind about Christianity. I still question its beliefs."
5,WOW! A tiny palindrome for a hugely wonderful novel.,"Left Behind was an excellent work of literature on all accounts. The plot was exciting and the charcters were well-developed and intriguiging. The most appealing quality is the overwhelming feeling of suspense presented throughout the book, especially at the conclusion. I have gone on to read all of the other books in the series so far; I've enjoyed them all immensely. Excellent."
3,An awsome book on the truth of our future,"Having met Tim LaHaye in person and spoken with him, I would have never realated him to this Book. He is a very polite and old fashion. He suggested ""Left Behind"" to me. so I bought a few copys for myself and friends. I have to admit it took me two and a half months to pick up the book. In only six days I have read ten chapters, and that is good for a non-reader like myself. I don't have great expertise on writing, but I didn't much like the style. The bouncing back and forth between characters was a good touch, it keeps you reading, but the text or word choice I could do without. Over all I enjoy the book and look forward to finishing the series."
4,The problem of the end,"The book was very interesting because Rayford's wife was always interested in christian stuff and is all into things that involve Jesus. This book centers on those that are ""Left Behind"" on earth. It shows the chaos that emerges as millions of people disappear, how people try to figure out what happened, how some re-find their fate in God, and how the Anti-Christ emerges. It's a well structured, swift paced book that focusses on world events as well as on personal experiences of people. I could not put it down, even though I wanted to.The downside of the book is that it still will be felt by the non-believer,that the authors are hoping to persuade people to their Shristian believes. That spoils some of the uncomplicated fun of reading this."
1,"Interesting concept, poor execution","Bad writing, good story. I think the authors were trying to follow the popularity of science fiction series that leave you dangling at the end of a book, thereby forcing you to buy the next in the series. Unfortunately, the writing isn't nearly as good as the early Robert Jordan, or Christian author C.S. Lewis. (Who didn't read the Narnia series as a child?) Too bad, because this was a great concept wasted."
2,Lukewarm writing about a less than solid Biblical view,"Christians, read your Bible. If you haven't read your Bible all the way through use the time you would have spent reading this series to catch up on Scripture reading. Let Scripture dictate your doctrine.The foundation of this entire series - the rapture - is a doctrine based on about three less-than-explicit verses. There is a lot more basis for other end-times beliefs.Non-Christians, I recomend you read something else if this would be your introduction to Christian beliefs. The writing just isn't that good, and the story is not representative of all Christian thought.I really feel uncomfortable ""bashing"" anyone's work, and I'm confident that the author's motives and intentions were pure. But I just can't recommend this book."
1,Disappointing,A thoroughly disapointing work. A found it nothing more than thinly veiled religious rhetoric passed off as comptemorary fiction. I wish I had read the coverleaf more carefully.
5,Great Book!,"This is a great book to read, but do remember that it is fictional (although based on facts from the bible). In other words, nothing can replace what has already been written in the bible. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the author's story. It is a very quick read and I am anxious to read the remaining books in the series. This book was a little reminder to me to live as though today might be my last. I intend to do so."
1,Couldn't finish...,"This series of books gave me nightmares. I read the first few, but they were just so violent and dark that I kept having dreams that the world had ended. I had to stop reading them."
3,Where it all started...,"The book that started it all. Left Behind is probably the one Christian book that even those who don't read Christian fiction have at least heard about. As I said before, though I personally don't agree with all the books' interpretations of prophecy, Left Behind does present on question every Christian should examine: Am I ready for Jesus to come back?The four main characters of this book certainly weren't. Rayford Steele is a pilot who only barely tolerates his wife's faith; his daughter Chloe is more concerned about college life and her future than religion. Buck Williams is a rising reporter; Bruce Barnes is a pastor who doesn't believe what he preaches. They weren't ready...will you be?"
5,The Time is Now,"For any non-believers out there this is your wake up call! If you ever wondered what will happen to you if you don't believe in Christ, this book is your key to knowledge. The author's have written an explosive novel (and series) about the Rapture. I love this book. Rayford, Chloe, Buck, Hattie...all seem like friends of mine and love to feel with them as they face their trials and tribulations. Read this book!"
5,Left Behind #1,"It belongs to a friend. While riding in the car, he let me ""look"" at it. In 20 minutes I covered 40 pages. A real nail biter, the story so awesome I had a difficult time putting it down. I offered him money for the book; he refused! A must buy, must read novel about the tribulation. I'm off to the bookstore to pick it up!"
3,Not my type of book,"I had no problem with the delivery and condition of this book, but I just couldn't get into it. I see that it was very popular, but just not my kind of book."
4,grabs you by the shirt collar,Left Behind: A Novel of the Earth's Last Days (Left Behind No. 1)Left Behind is a definite page turner! The story develops quite well andreally encourages thought about the subject matter.The ending is open but thats understandable since it is allin process...that is - revelations
1,"Silly, shallow and plain bad.","This books reads like a a kindergarten kid telling you: ""see? I told you mom would come"". Its supposedly Bible-based scenarios are such a stretch that they make the parting of the Red Sea look like something I might see during my commute every day. And I see far more wonderous things , believe me. It is a moral fable of very low quality. Its 'simplistic' (not simple) views are a drag . It's characters reactions and behaviour are so unrealistic they become symbols: greed, lust...just like in a medieval tableau. Last time someone though that the Messiah would come with BIG announcements, there was some disappointment."
1,Left Me Cold,"I got the tape version of this book because my book group decided to read it. I think my first sign of trouble was the name of one of the main characters--Rayford Steele. Sounded like a 'bodice ripper' character to me. And, the anti-Christ character is a very shallow representation of a sort of charismatic, messianic 'baddie'. Why is he Russian? I also kept wondering 'what about Jews', but found they were neatly taken care of by God having appointed Jewish messengers who would convert the poor, unknowing souls to the one, true answer. I really do not understand the enormous appeal of this series of books. I am not a 'non-believer' but find the whole idea very unreal and uninteresting. I also felt I was being set up for the remainder of the series. The plot clanked along to a sort of badly done 'Right Stuff' image of the four saviors, who 'got it', ready to save the world from the Russian 'baddie'. Save me--from the rest of the series."
2,"Interesting, at most",One sentence echoed in my mind while I read this book; It could be so good. This book has so much potential but fails to ever reach it. The plot is interesting but the writing is far from quality. This book should become the definition of weekend reading. It DOES NOT challenge the mind.
4,Good reading on future events,"This book is a good book to read for enjoyment, however I just finished the most recent book which is number 10 in the series and it has drawn out too much. The entire series could have been condensed into 4. I still enjoy reading it but the doctrine does not completely line up. As a seminary student preparing for the ministry, during the tribulation the only people who will have the opportunity to get saved will be those who have never heard the gospel before. If you have heard the plan of Salvation before it is too late after the rapture. That is why it is so important to accept Christ now."
2,"If you think this is good, read The Last Day . . .","I read Left Behind, Assassins and Tribulation before I took a friend's recommendation and read another Judgment Day novel, Glen Kleier's The Last Day, which is INFINITELY better. There is vastly more story, provocative thought and soul rattling frights in The Last Day than in any of the above mentioned Jenkins/LaHaye books. That stuff is Judgment Day light in comparison and never delivers the deeper message and tensions that Last Day does. If you must read all these books, do yourself a favor and read them BEFORE you read Last Day, or you'll never go back to them. Last Day gives the whole experience that these lightweight attempts miss."
2,Poor literature,"Although this book had fewer flips back and forth between characters, it still is far too often for enjoyable reading. The story is interesting and I applaud their efforts, but the characters are shallow and Chloe is becoming very annoying; the characters are described time and again rather than developed and drawing the reader into that development. Perhaps the most annoying facet is the book describes a piece Chaim wrote, then includes a couple of pages of what Chaim wrote, and then all the other characters are greatly moved/touched/yada yada by it. I feel either it should be moving and not described or not included and we should just be told it was moving. To outline eschatology thought and then complement oneself through fictional characters seems extremely self-glorifying and nauseating.Skip this book. The fact that the number of books is jumping and that the overall plot development is slow and occurs mainly at the end of the book makes the authors seem greedy."
2,"Good Concept, Bad writing","I am a Christian and would like to promote books like this. However, to be honest, I would have to concede that the writing is mediocre at best. The characters are shallow and rarified. Their are few facets to them and they are unrealistic. For example, this whole story involves people who are left behind after the rapture in a 'godless' world, yet no one ever utters a word of profanity. Everyone behaves in a ""Leave it to Beaver"" manner and the bad guys say words like ""heck"" and ""darn"". The two main characters, Rayford and Buck, are exactly the same--BORING. Also, the plot is awfully thin and shallow. The characters rarely ""do"" anything but sit around and be contemplative. Overall, I feel the book series is a lot of slick packaging and marketing with little substance."
2,Why all the hype?,"All these five-star reviews makes this out to be the best book since the Bible. And sure, it was mildly interesting, but it wasn't THAT good. The characters were fairly cardboard, the theology was questionable, and the dialogue rather stilted. I fear that the church is starving for decent literature and instead is wasting its time on the literary equivalent of Twinkies. Or maybe Ding Dongs."
1,For what it's worth..my two cents,"Like others who have posted here, this book was recommended to me with great fanfare. As someone who is a Christian, I looked forward to reading it with the hope that it presented a message which could be shared with my friends and family who are not Christian. Was I ever disappointed. And even more to the point, I was embarassed. This book is full of cliches, some of the most uninterestng characters I have ever experienced in litertature, and numerous (too many to name here)plot discrepencies. As a believer we are challenged to spread the gospel, this book does nothing to further the gospel in the eyes of the non-believer. My greatest concern is that any non-believer would foreever be flabbergasted at the simplistic writing style exhibited in this book.My recommendation is to spend time reading the Bible and let God's grace speak to you. This did nothing of the sort to me.Regards,"
4,Interestign Christian fiction,"Left Behind is an interesting book of Christian fiction. Thought and self examination of religious views will, of course, follow upon reading this book. That's not to say that one should replace beliefs by what is read in these pages; it is afterall represented as Christian fiction. What this book does is make you think about the subject.The story follows characters as they experience and search for answers to events around them concerning bizarre happenings related to what is believed to be written about in the Bible's Book of Revelations.It is evident by the reviews here that people vary widely in their beliefs on the subject and its details. Let us look at this as an impetus to thought provoking discourse about an interesting book of Christian fiction."
4,Unfair to compare Left Behind to Last Day,"I think that comparing any of the Left Behind series to Kleier's doomsday novel, The Last Day, is a mistake. Kleier's novel is a rivetting read and one of the finest suspense thrillers I've ever read, but I don't think it was intended to be a religious novel, per se. Left Behind is, and it creates the sort of gut-level religious awe many people are looking for. Last Day is more a thinking man's Judgment Day story. It creates an awe of a different kind, more provocative and profound, not so visceral, more mental. These books are different pieces of literature intended for different purposes. Very worthwhile, each in their own way."
3,Pretty good thriller,"This is a pretty good thriller, as Judgment Day books go, but rather lightweight, I felt. Of the dozen or so Apocalyptic books I've read, by far the most interesting, scariest and heaviest hitting is The Last Day, by Glenn Kleier. Provocative but uplifting, The Last Day brings far more realism and excitement to this tricky theme than Lahaye/Jenkins. At no time do any of the Left Behind novels raise themselves to the level of Last Day."
3,An interested exercise for anybody interested.,"I didn't think this book was a masterpiece in adult fiction. Some of the dialog is a little painful and the characters are a bit thin. But what I find more interesting then the actual book is the pattern I see emerging in the reviews of this book. I have a suggestion for anybody who would like to spend a couple of minutes in research. Read or just skim through about fifty reviews of this book and then look up 2 Corinthians 2: 14-16 (that's the second book of Corinthians, chapter 2, versus 14-16) in any bible.Coincidently enough, verse 17 may be of interest to any of you ""a-"" or ""postmillennial"" believers who believe that LaHaye distorted revelation to make a buck; but to this . . . I have no comment."
3,Interesting and worth reading,"The book confirms my belief that I absolutely DO NOT want to be left behind. The level of writing is not very challenging and the story sometimes jumps from spot-to-spot without full development. Nonetheless, it is entertaining. At least the language is clean!"
5,Left Behind,I couldn't put this book down. It read like a novel and captured my interest from the very beginning. Has wonderfully thought out characters while slowly unfolding the book of revelations. The book is so easy to read you almost forget that it is based on the bible. This book will captivate any reader and will excited them about the book of revelations and Christ's second coming. Don't be left behind!
5,AWESOME,"I have heard a lot about these books, since my father is apastor and have just started reading the series. Currently, he ispreaching on the book of Revelations making this book all the more fascinating. I HIGHLY reccommend it. END"
1,time waster,"Why are most free books about Christianity? I'm so sick of it! This author did it in a very sneaky way. For what it's worth, I will never ever believe your so called god when you do it like this. what a waste of time"
2,Book review,"Directed to a very specific audience. A church sermon in book form. As a novel it was boring and uninteresting with limited character development and it seemed to end in mid-story.I fault myself for not investigating the authors before getting this book, however there was nothing provided that hinted at the plot or story line when I checked it out on Amazon Kindle books.My guess is that one would have to read the entire series of these books to get to a point of relevence, an boring task I am not willing to take."
5,Best series ever!,I absolutely love this book and the entire series. Once I started reading I could not put the books down.
4,Enjoying the book,"I just started it, not crazy about the jumping around from each character, but I want to read the series. Love the e-book."
5,Wonderful book,"I've read read book before so I already knew I would enjoy it, though I believe more in a mid-trib rapture I still believe a lot of the details in this book are pretty dead on."
2,"As an evangelistic tract, this book FAILS.","Sorry to burst your bubbles, but if you Christians expect us to be convinced by this book, think again. This book is little more than an attempt to scare people into religious faith, and in that regard, most street preachers are more persuasive than this book.Strip away all the hype, all the contrived plot devices, all the fantastic imaginings, and you are left with endless unanswered questions: Is belief in God to be predicated merely on personal, subjective experience, or must I wait for a cataclysmic ""Independence Day"" kind of event? How do you have any certainty as to the identity (or benevolence) of your God? How do you ascertain the authenticity and reliability of your Bible?I will not be browbeaten into believing this kind of empty propaganda. If the authors had written something more coherent and compelling, like Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose, I might be more persuaded."
2,"A modest epic with ""extra stuff"" thrown in...","Having been given this book by a friend for a long plane trip, I managed to read almost all of it in one sitting. That is not to say that it was particularly gripping. The book is extremely simply written. Large text, simple sentences, uncomplicated plot devices, and a pre-determined plot (guess what, god wins...).I did enjoy the book from a brain junk-food perspective. The story is an interesting read. The concept is quite intriguing, even if from a secular standpoint.Minus the religious babble thrown into the book, it's an okay read -- something to occupy your mind while, say, sitting on a subway train or in an airplane flying across the country.I can't say I was religiously moved by the book, and frankly, it fairly drips with religious admoninitions. If you can see past that, though, you'll be sure to get your two-stars' worth of epic adventure reading out of it.Borrow it; don't buy it."
5,Wonderful!!!,"This series is wonderful. I really loved all of the books, when they would come out I would buy AND read the whole book the day it came out"
3,Surprising,"I started reading the series because the girls in my office were so impressed with it. I am not exactly the religious type, but I have discovered you do not have to be to like the book. The author(s) wrote this book and the series, I feel, to grasp attention to believers and non-believers. Anyhow, I love to read and have not been able to find a really good book lately so I am thrilled that there are more in the series to come. All ingredients to make a great story have definitely been mixed into this novel; Passion, Adventure, Mystery, Suspense, etc.. I would encourage any one who enjoys reading to dive into this one!"
4,A very good book,This is a great book. It would have been better if they left out the rapture. It will get you thinking about your values in life. But please who would believe that people will just dissapear off the planet. Not me and you shouldn't either. Other than the rapture I believe that most of the book follows the Bible pretty well.
4,Best Christian Fiction,"As the series (this far) seems to constitute a whole, and since the good and bad points are consistant with each, I'll simply put my entire series review here. I thoroughly enjoyed the series, although I do not hold the views of the authors. The plot moves forward at a quickening pace (although books 1 and 7 are excrutiating slow reads); the suspense sections are page-turners, and [the series] challenges in many places. The only problem I really found is one linked with the purpose of the book - conversion. It seemed like every time something happened, someone had to spend (what seemed like) several paragraphs remembering what it was like before he/she was saved. These sections only challenged me to scream ""Get over it, and get on with the plot!"" With that exception, though, I felt it the most entertaining Christian series I've ever read. Definately a must-read for everyone."
3,Lighten Up!!!,"I am an avid reader who generally reads Stephen King, Kootz, etc., and while I am saved, I admittedly have not lived my life according to the ""word"" for some time. The series, while I admit is not very well written, has been a tremendous help for me. It has taught me a great deal about the Bible in such a way that I want to learn more. As far as accuracy, it's pretty obvious that there hundreds of interpretations, so lighten up, this is Lahaye and Jenkins' interpretation - the most accepted interpretation being King James'. For the ""Christian on the Fence"" I think it's a great learning tool and can guide you in the direction of Christ, which hopefully is the authors' goal. Since I began this series I have I probably wouldn't recommend this series to a devout Christian since they undoubtedly have their own interpretations of Revelations; however, it may make a world of difference. READ ON!!!!"
4,Makes you think what's going to happen in the future,"I thought that this book was full of excitment and was really fun to read. It tells you about an (almost) affair with Rayford Steele and Hattie Durham and then swirches to another part of a story of Buck Williams. Buck Williams part is about him working at the Global Weekly and writing articles about the disappearances and this is where he meets Rayford to learn about his side of the story. I thought that some parts in this book were actually boring, but there were some parts where you just wanted to keep reading."
5,Isn't it amazing..,"how every form of literature and belief can be tolerated in ""secular"" bookstores except this type of book. Liberals like to espouse freedom of speech and then absolutely go nuts when someone who disagrees with them comes into prominent view. I for one do not agree with everything written the book, and agree that it could have been written better, but I found it entertaining. Most people would be surprised how many people believe in some variation of this version of the end of time. If this were a muslim version, I'm sure there would be many accolades, but since there is extreme prejudice against ""fundamental"" Christians, there will only be criticism."
5,It enlightens...,"This book is a must-read for anyone who has questions about the rapture. It is a very readable novel about ""The Earth's Last Days"", and the people who were, ""Left Behind"". Full of drama that has no end, this book is a contuning series, one that doesn't dissappoint. MUST READ"
2,Not literature,"Fine Bible study, but not good literature. Not the best writing, character development or plotting. If you want more quality writing/suspense and less Bible lesson, read the more challenging account of end times in Glenn Kleier's THE LAST DAY, which is the high water mark of all the millennium-based thrillers out there (and I know, I read them all.)"
3,"A page turner, but a few things bothered me.","If most of your family disappeared along with half the world's people, wouldn't there be memorial services on every corner? Nary a mention of even one. If you were an airline pilot, wouldn't you wonder how many pilots, air traffic controllers, etc. were left? He took off and flew without asking a question. Wouldn't you wonder if our country had a government? Our government just stood by and let all this UN stuff happen? Life just seemed to flow on, Chloe made a fast conversion, Hattie came out of nowhere to be the right hand (and whatever else) of the most powerful man in the world? A bit of a stretch and everything fell into place a little too neatly. I'm sitting here wondering if I want to read the next 3-4 books. I'm also wondering what happened next - so I guess, despite the large leaps, it was a grabber."
2,My analysis after three books in the set,"I know a good many people enjoy these Lahaye/Jenkins novelsbecause they are very biblically oriented, and that's all well andgood, I don't knock it. But as literature goes, to be honest, these books are NOT very well written. The characters are thin, artificial, the writing forced and simplistic. A far deeper and more compelling Apocalyptic novel is Glenn Kleier's THE LAST DAY. Although NOT biblically accurate in many apsects, the story is hugely suspenseful and the spiritual nature far deeper than any of the three books of this series I've read so far, APOLLYON, TRIBULATION and LEFT BEHIND. Because of this, I found THE LAST DAY considerably more fulfilling, spiritually, and certainly more thrilling from a literary perspective. If your interest is a superior story, and less the scriptural application, THE LAST DAY is a more rewarding read."
3,The good and bad...,"Well, the theology made me think but the characters were thin. The little romance appeared to be like two 60 yr olds hitting on each other. Some of the expressions haven't been used since the '40s! But oh well, I guess that's what the authors know."
2,Not the best of this genre,"I was taken in by all the hype on this novel. It is not nearlyso well crafted, suspenseful, frightening or intelligent as GlennKleier's THE LAST DAY. THE LAST DAY is the final word in End Time novels and the best of the batch of millennium novels to hit the bookstands. If you found anything of interest in LEFT BEHIND, you will go ballistic over THE LAST DAY."
4,Great Story...,"I'm not religious so I find this series very preachy. However, I do appreciate the story line. It reminds me very much of Stephen King's ""The Stand."" I do enjoy the series, but..., there are a lot of parts I skip over, as it's very repetative. That's where it's preachy. Certain characters keep repeating about how they became Christian. I understood the first ten times they axplained it. Even reading it three books later, I haven't forgotten it. Otherwise the series is really good."
5,"Spiritually Challenging, Faith Building novel","This novel, and the rest of the series, have completely changed my attitudes towards the Apocalypse. I have recommended it to anyone who will listen, because I believe it will change their lives. The events in this novel are very powerful, and very true. The authors have also avoided using profanity and worldy writing, while still making the characters believable. Please read these books before you are left behind."
4,Fun fiction read - better than the Bible,"Great entertaining science fiction book but lets not get carried away with this Rapture stuff. Some great lessons can be pulled from the story, but let's not take this stuff literally. I'm looking forward to reading the next sequel (as I understand there will be 11 more). The authors figured out that they could make some money off the 'biblical rapture'. I wonder if they will get 'left behind'?"
5,The Left Behind series changed my life!,"I was totally drawn into the series from page one, book one! At times it seems the books are ripped from today's headlines with a little SciFi and Horror added. Then you realize it's all in the Bible prophesied thousands of years ago! This series will scare the Devil out of you!"
5,"This book puts ""feet"" on the Book of revelation.","Once I started reading this book I could not put it down it literally had me cheering, crying and laughing like a movie normally would. It has opened my eyes to the warnings of the book of Revelation and has spring boarded my study of end time prophecy."
3,Be Wary,"Watch out. THough this is a well written piece of work, don't let the rest of this series fool you. With each book, the story gets weaker and the writing gets worse. Such a shame."
4,Interesting subject matter,"This book is for all those who go to church and believe the bible yet don't think about the prophecies in Revelations being fulfilled in their life time. This book shows how a charismatic, evil leader could rise to power and play everyone around them like puppets on a string. I particularly loved the part in which the rising anti-christ is chosen as ""Sexiest Man Alive"" by People magazine. While you may have some reservations in believing how the ""last days"" will play out, this book will give you food for thought and show you that the Bible doesn't just talk about occurrances more than 2,000 years ago. It talks about things that are yet to come."
4,Very entertaining.,This book was very interesting and got even better as the story went on. I would highly recommend it but it will leave you a little unfulfilled if you don't want to read the next book. This story doesn't end with book one.
3,left behind,"even thou i own and enjoyed all the left behind abridged series. there is just too much left out from the unabridged books, some of the charitors come from nowhere and some get lost from book to book. unless you've read the paper books its easy to get lost, and you feel you've missed something. i've recomended the series to several people, and had them come back to me and ask where did this person come from or what happened to that person, also what happened between this time and that."
5,An Eye-Opening Page Turner,"I started this book as a Christian who had little knowledge of the Rapture. I knew some were pre-trib, some were post-trib, some didn't know--I really didn't care. Now I want to know, I want to learn much more about it. This book (a pre-trib account) certainly got my attention.I was shocked when I saw some of the negative reviews for this book. There can only be a few reasons: 1) Non-Christians who don't believe, 2) Christians who are adamantly post-trib, or 3) Christians who think they know more than the authors.If you are any of the above, then you won't like what the book has to say. This book is for people who want to learn more. It's not meant to be the next ground-breaking novel in literature (although I must say I was captivated). It's a new spin on an old story. Read your Bible."
1,Disappointing,"Very disappointed in the quality of writing put out by a reputable publisher. I read the first book and cringed, but kept on to book 2 because the subject is interesting. I tried to start book 3 and couldn't force myself any longer. It's rushed and cliched in many places with a few intriguing segments in between. I'm sad that such a potentially high-impact and magnetic subject was handled with so little concern for literary quality. Pop novels at best."
4,Intrigued,"Well, I've read a lot of negative reviews here. I agree with some. A few of the characters are very annoying. The story got a bit repetitive and dull in the middle. However, I find the story intriguing and I want to read more. That makes the book good, in my opinion."
2,Too repetitive,"Maybe ,if written as a short story, this tale would have been better. Not as satisfying as a tv show due to repetitions of action and thoughts attempting to disguise Bible metaphors to be literal guidelines for current day. Another way to force people to a narrow outlined relationship with God based on fear of the future."
5,Amazing book!,What a great way to learn about the book of revelations. I have always heard about the seven years of tribulations but by putting actual characters behind it all was really great. I can't wait to read the next book.
5,Fascinating!!!,"At first I thought the writing a little amaturish, but then the truths from the Bible and the way they were applied fascinated me. I am ordering another book for my son in prison. He is now saved and witnessing for the Lord and I think this book will be a real wake-up call to those ""dudes"" in prison who claim to be Christians but do not want to stand up and be counted."
5,Can't put it down!,"We read the first four books in the ""Left Behind"" series in less than a week, even with a full time job, two young children at home and a husband that travels.It will be hard to wait for the next in the series. Knowing myself, I will probably read all four again just when the new one comes out.Lahaye and Jenkins have a style that is easy to read, with just enough detail that one can visualize the scene, feel you are there and that you know the characters personally. I can't wait to find out what happens to Buck and Chloe and what the deep, dark secret is about Amanda.I now find myself going back to my bible at every opportunity to get the story ""from the horse's mouth"" as it were."
5,The best book I have ever read,"This book is great. I would read it again if I wanted to. It is stimulating, breathtaking, and enlighting. I can't wait for the movie to come out. I would give it better than 5 stars if possible.s"
5,Good Fiction?,"Thiss is the one that will hook you into the series. I've read all but ""The Indwelling""(just strarting) and they all make for interesting reading. This is one of the best in the series, maybe the best. No need to preach here but the books do a pretty good job of it. 1215 reviews and counting, so pick em. It is a quick read so you can get through it fast, it'll definitely have you thinking."
5,Amazon books,"I ordered the first book in the Left Behind series because my book was defective. The Amazon book was not defective at all. I have read it and am in the fourth book ""Soul Harvest."" I would order from Amazon again."
4,Not what I was thinking--,"If you're looking for a book to flip through while you're trying to relax, this is a good one. Not too heavy or hard to understand(will probably be critisized because of its lack of complexity). Compelling plot(Especially if you're into the end of the world type stuff). It is exceedingly religious though, which will probably turn a lot of readers off. Just keep in mind, it is fiction. In works of fiction, we should seek to understand the world that the author portrays to us. I was mostly interested in the book for the sense of ""Christianity"" it strove so hard to get across. I am not particularly religious, but I'm always curious about philosophy. I believe that this book gave me an honest view into what being a Chrisitian is all about."
4,A description of the Rapture,"Read this book as someone who feel the need for Christ in your life. If you want to read a novel with all the ""secular"" elements, then check out Clancy or DeMille. I am a Christian, and yet I found myself praying once again the prayer of salvation with ""Pastor Billings"". I felt the profound loneliness of being in a world without other Christians. Even though I have read the book of Revelations 3 times, I found myself filling the margins of my bible with study notes taken from this novel. Forget the thin writing style - this was not the author's purpose. They simply wanted to communicate the book of Revelation so anyone can understand it and appreciate the second coming of Christ, all within an entertaining storyline."
3,Fun read -- but more than a little corny,"As a Christian who is not quite comfortable with the ""born again"" label, I have to admit I enjoyed this novel and plowed through it in one long sitting. Although I don't believe the events described in the book of Revelations are meant to be taken literally (I.E. - I don't believe in the Rapture and hope it never happens), it is definately a fun and spooky thing to daydream about...The thing to remember is that the authors certainly have an agenda and I have heard and read that the newer installments of this series expose these beliefs (anti-Catholic stuff, etc.) a little more indiscreetly. I think the true idea of Christianity is about Jesus, not church-going and the amount of prayers you say. This book seems to focus entirely too much on ""works"" and ""deeds"". Fun read, but my advice is to ""know when to say when"" haha."
3,Quick Read but Lacks detail,"I buzzed through this book in just a few days. It is a very quick reading book but really lacks in character building. Much of the book is dialect between a few main characters. I found it difficult to indentify with any of the characters and to put myself in their shoes, which in my opinion is the key to good writing.The plot is strong and keeps you reading even though the writing talents just aren't there. The exciting conclusion and cliff hanger did entice me enough to read Left Behind #2, but after reading that I decided that I don't enjoy these books enough to continue through the series.A decent read but it's the same old, same old in the next book of the series. I lost interest."
4,Have fun with it!,"I have never been a big reader. A friend recommended this book to me and I thought I would check it out! Well I am very glad that I did, myself being an 8-year veteran of Catholic School I figured I would find this book interesting and I was very right.This is a really interesting and fun book to read, a ""why can't I stop reading this"" page turning thriller! The one thing to remember is not to take this book so seriously and to please remember that it is just a story. Even though it is based on Revelation in the bible doesn't mean this story is a word for word translation. This book is one mans view on the topic and very well done in fact!I would have to recommend this book to anyone with an interest in revelation and the end of the world; it certainly does make you think!"
2,"Wonderful story, poorly written","The story of the Rapture of the Church should be a gripping read - a true page turner - an all-nighter. Unfortunately, this attempt to capture the drama of those left behind, is cliche ridden and so poorly written that it was all I could do to finish the book. The characters are one-dimensional, the dialog is awkward, and the plot devises are predictable. The authors are certainly to be commended for attempting to bring the story to the mass market, but this book is a dismal failure as literature."
4,"Read this book, it may change you...","Certinally not all christian faiths believe that the end will be exactly as described in Revelation. But there is a strong message here, and it applies whether the End comes in your lifetime or your lifetime ends before the End. It's not Stienbeck or Hemmingway (and it's poor science fiction) but it is entertaining and certinally gets exciting. And unless you're really into shortcuts, skip the video. TV movie quality and too much cut out to make an impact."
5,"Left Behind, #1","I am usually not much of a reader, in fact, I don't enjoy reading. But I have gotten hooked on this series, and I find myself fascinated and eager to begin each book. I am hoping that there will be more books, and I would like to see Movies for each of the books!"
4,This book takes you on a real faith journey!,"Left Behind is a novel by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins. I really enjoyed reading this book, and can understand why it is a best seller. For all Christians who are strong in their faith, I would recommend reading this book. In this fiction book the theme is about the rapture, and this novel reveals how the world will end. Rayford Steele, a pilot, is flying one day and comes to the realization that half of his crew is gone. They are gone but all their valuables and clothes are still there like they just disappeared. How can this be? Is it God? Is it Nature? He has to try to make sense of what is going on while he is home. Can he still be saved? Can he figure out what is going on? This marvelous book takes the reader on a journey with many twists and turns. I would encourage people to read this to get some idea of the authors theory of what will happen to all mankind at the time of the rapture."
5,I'm hooked!!!,"This is the best book I've read. From the moment I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It lays out Revelations wonderfully. With realistic characters in realistic settings and situations, it puts the ""end times"" in a whole new perspective. May God bless the authors of this book."
5,"If you have not read this, you are FORTUNATE!","I say fortunate because there are now 5, almost 6 books for you to grab and READ!! These books are AWESOME! You can get this first book, and have another ready to satisfy that craving for more... no waiting for a year for the next book to see what happens!!No one can say they do not need to read these books, they will change your life - regardless of your feelings towards religion, and what is going on in your life.Don't be left behind..."
5,Great novel for all who are in wonder of the days to come.,"This book contains not only cliffhanging action but also scriptural insite on the last days. This book inspires the reader to think ahead and ask himselp ""will i be left behind?"" This is a must read book!"
4,"If you liked this, you must read THE LAST DAY","Let me share with you the best ""end-time"" novel of them all--Glenn Kleier's spell-binding THE LAST DAY. No other such story can equal it for authenticity, heart-pounding suspense, emotional upliftment, or spiritual mystery. I number it among the most powerful novels I've ever read and invite readers to compare it to LEFT BEHIND for a truly surprising and gratifying read."
2,"Average Plot, not enough though","The book begins with the rapture(the end of the world), and a pilot sad about his wife dying. It does not get better. The terrible writing is hidden through engaging characters, with horrid description. A 3rd grader could read it. It is annonyingly simplistic, but interesting. Read at your own risk."
5,Excellent Series,"""Left Behind"" is one of the best books I've read. I'm on book #5 right now, and let me tell you, these books are addicting! I can't read them fast enough. If you're a believer, you'll be blown away. If you're not a believer, you just might be after reading these books.Keep in mind, this isn't depressing reading, but it's heavy reading. None the less, these are excellent books!P.S. Check out the movies, too!"
1,...and Yet people buy these books.,"Contemporary Christian music is notorious for being a watered down imitation of secular music. It is usually below average in quality and only has value because it is a digestible form that sheltered Christians can listen to without feeling guilty. The same can definitely be said for this entire books series. Frankly, the only mildly impressive thing about these books are the authors' ability to stretch a few verses across 200+ in order to keep the money flowing in. This may be the only popular book series out there that have the literary quality, depth, and character development of a freshmen high school student's creative writing assignmentThere have been many great works of fiction as well as movies that have successfully used the bible as a basis for a great work of fiction. These books often can be enjoyed by the religious as well as the non-religious. I have yet to hear a positive review for this serious except from the very religious"
2,Sorely disappointing. . .,"The only readers who will come away satisfied with this series (I quit halfway through ""Soul Harvest"") are fundamentalist who can't get enough of the same ol' fire and brimstone. These books are the shallowest of shallow, with about as much intellectual stimulation as a bowl of cold oatmeal. There are vastly more exciting and fearsome novels on the subject of The Last Day--not the least of which is the novel by the same name--""The Last Day."" If you have the mental wherewithal for a really scary spiritual ride, ""The Last Day"" delivers a story of unsurpassed suspense and controversy. If you just like to sit back and veg out, stick with this juvenile ""Left Behind"" stuff!"
3,Not to be taken literally,"I picked this up after hanging out at the bookstore for awhile. I had never heard of this book or the series. I read the first page and figured this would be a good fluff novel. I got home and began to read, I though I was reading Stephen King's short story ""The Langoliers"" I did not find it to be preachy but interesting, made me reflect on my beliefs some. It is poorly written and the characters lack substance. I don't believe the anti-christ will be so obvious as to rise to a world power in about a two month span and not be detected by more that 10 people. The story is predictable. My attention was really held in the beginning and the last chapter but I laughed to myself. Hypnosis? during a press conference? really folks, I mean we all are idiots sometime but I think the authors are taking our intelligence for granted. All in all great fluff novel to take my mind of problems of today's world."
5,Good book in a fabulous series of books.,"Taken alone I would have gone with 3 or 4 stars, but thiis book sets up the rest of the series, and the series was engrossing and captivating. I thoroughly enjoyed the Left Behind books. You don't have to be born again to appreciate the series, but it may cause you to think about salvation in a whole new light."
3,Captivating story fails with poor writing,"The story, based on the book of Revelation, is a good one. The story was why I bought, and read, the book. But, I'm only a high school student, but I can recognize what is good writing and what is not. This is certainly the latter. Buck Williams, the magazine journalist for the equivalent of ""Time,"" was developed terribly. He said and did so many things out of character. Also, there are no details in this book at all! I could not create one picture in my mind of how the setting looked. Also, the ending stinks. The author took the absolute easiest way out--it was cheesy."
3,It's okay,"I like to read books that paint a picture of where we are headed and what we can expect to happen. I don't mind dark visions of the future. There have been many dark periods in our past and no reason to expect different in the years to come. I stayed with the story and found it entertaining but completely implausible in construction. I have read ""Transfer"" by Jerry Furland, ""1984"" by George Orwell, and ""Unintended Consequences"" by John Ross. Amy of these, most especially Furland, will satisfy the demand for believability and probability. I think these ""Left Behind"" books interpretation of biblical prophecy is just that-the author's interpretation."
1,Shock Schlock,"Poorly written paranoia, slow paced, inexpertly plotted, one dimensional characters. Cynically pitched at the Christian audience, without any redeeming ideas or thought beyond the profit motive."
5,"I read all 5 books in this series, in 8 days!","I absoultely cannot wait until ""Assassins"" comes out in August! I first heard about this series through Amazon and purchased ""Left Behind"" and read it in one day and ran back to the book store first thing the next morning and bought the rest of the series. Read them - you can't stop!"
5,On the edge of your seat reading!,"This book, and the whole series, is awesome. If you ever want an up todate look at the end of the world this is the book for you. If you want to see Biblical Prophecy in action read this book. Will you be left behind to discover the truth?"
5,"A message so true, yet unaccepted","I simply loved Left Behind and went on to read the other 4 books out so far. I cannot wait for The Assassins! I noticed some other reviews that mentioned it was too predictable. Hello! I thought. God shows us (not necessarily very clearly) what will happen in the future. Should we change that to take away its predictability? Oh, yes, not give this to non-believing friends? God works in miraculous ways and who knows that this book might be what helps lead someone to Him. We should not limit Him to what we think He is capable of. This will happen. Those not prepared will be left behind. I thank God I will not be one of those people. This book begs for you to answer the simple question, ""Will you be left behind?"" If you have not read this book, I encourage you to do so. Tell a few friends. God is using people like Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins through these novels.Trust me, read one and you will be hooked. Thank you for reading and God bless."
5,"Thought provoking,keeps you on the edge of your seat","Once you start reading you can't put it down. Be prepared to purchase all of the LEFT BEHIND series books, you won't want to miss any of them. If hollywood doesn't make a mini sereies out of this I will really be surprised.Even though this book is written as fiction, anyone who knows the bible will shurly get a teary eye ( several times ) during your reading."
3,Couldn't put it down,"I've always been interested in Biblical prophecy, and so I was drawn to this series. I enjoyed the story and really couldn't put it down. I only wish the writing wasn't so simplistic and repetitive."
1,I wish I would have left this book behind.,"I'd have to say ""Left Behind"" wins the award for worst novel ever..."
1,Not the quality novel it's made out to be.,"I have no idea why this book has been acclaimed by so many people-- even by many Christians-- as a great work of literature. The plot is weak and chock-full of bland, superfluous details. Buck's part of the story is particularly uninteresting. There are just too many things going on all at once. His part of the story gives us the specifics of how he plugged in his computer to an outlet and how his subconscious waking system didn't work one day when he wanted to get up at 8 and instead woke up 45 minutes later.I also believe that the end-times view this book supports has no biblical backing, though this is not the reason why I gave this book only one star. I hold to the Postmillenialist viewpoint and would love to have a discussion if you have any questions/arguments about this particular viewpoint or end-times in general. (In the comment section, I have posted a short paper about end times.)"
1,There's No Nice Way To Put It,"This is the worst book I have ever had the misfortune to lay eyes on. I have read unpublished fanfiction by 13-year-olds with more believable characters and compelling prose.The characters' actions are ludicrous; the dialogue is eye-rollingly painful; the writing is juvenile and full of errors; the plot is convoluted and nonsensical; the theology is insulting, simplistic and offensive. If you have any measure of taste, stay away from this one."
5,You owe it to yourself to read this and be changed.,"I was not expecting much when I received this as a gift. I've always been unsettled and somewhat afraid by talk of the rapture. This book makes it all so clear. I recognized the events as prophecy but it had been so confusing to me before. I now feel so much more at ease about the future AND am taking steps to change my life. You owe to yourself whether you believe in the second coming or not, to examine this book. You won't be sorry. I was stealing the time even at stop lights to read! The story is so compelling! I can hardly wait to read the rest of the series!"
1,I was an atheist before I read this...,"But now I'm converted: speed the day to the rapture so that the world will be cleansed of the appalling types who like this bilge and read it without irony - and probably with their lips moving.I don't know if it's true that the devil has all the best songs, but certainly Jesus is ill-served by his literary followers -if LaHaye can be described as literate in the received sense.I read this simply because of its reputed popularity in the U.S.A. As the saying goes, 'only in the U.S.A.' - no other nation on earth could produce such a camp, vulgar phenomenon of such popularity. And what a masterpiece of easy-to-read prejudice, hatred and medieval credulity: a wicked, wicked I tell you, United Nations, villainous non-Americans, heroic non-non-Americans, and so on ad nauseam.I bet the reading lists of the book groups in Americans' version of heaven are really challenging..."
1,Total waste of time and money,"Poorly written, OMFG! That this book is so popular does not say much for the American education system when supposedly educated adults find this less than mediocre BS entertaining. They should have published this in comic book form, the dialogue is already written for it! If you have not read this book yet, don't waste your time or your money. I think most people were ""guilted"" into reading and confessing to enjoy it by their christian bothers and sisters. What better way to sell a book but by using guilt? Mel Gibson is having success with the Passion for the same reason. People are made to feel like they are letting god down if they don't see this movie or read this book. They are like sheep, blindly led to empty their wallets into the pockets of their leaders.AMEN!"
2,Science Fiction or Religious Fiction ?,Believability and common sense are completely ignored in this religious novel. What happens to the world if 'The Rapture' occurs and half of earth's population suddenly disappears? Clever but silly story that would be considered science fiction without the fanatical religious background. Cannot recommend.
2,Dogma,"This is religious dogma thinly disguised as popular fiction. It seems to me to use a fanciful fictitious situation to attempt to convert the gullible and conspiracy theorists. What promise it had was ruined by the preaching and flawed logic(faith???). ,"
2,We get it already,"Ok. I would have liked this book much better if it hadn't been so preachy. We get it. Get saved or get left behind. If I wanted a religious book, I would have downloaded the bible."
5,One of my favorite series,I love the Left Behind series! It is so great to see the authors' imaginations taking shape and developing over the series.
4,awesome!,Love the way the author catches your attention right away. It made me catch a glimpse of what is going on with my faith these days. Love it
2,THIS ONE LEFT ME OUT!,"Ya know, I heard some hype about this series, and of all places - my own sister whom I really never get to talk to, but this book series sounded intriguing. I read over half the novel and just got plum bored to tears and getting sick and tired of the mahem going all around these characters, but nothing really happening to them directly. Chaos abounds but these characters yet have little problems with getting around and noone bothered them much. I really was looking for a fast-paced adventure-like story with - O.K. some preaching and mind provoking lessons perhaps, but the only thing I got was - left behind!"
3,Did I just bite a lemon?,"I'll try not to be redundant. Similar thoughts have already been described in recent reviews regarding the quality of the writing (below average) and the drawing of the characters (thin). I've rarely run across a book that actually made me wince, but this one did. Yes, the writing can be that bad.But....the story was entertaining enough to justify a minor investment of time. You can definitely skip through a few pages (i.e. the cooing between Chloe and Buck).How difficult would it have been to take the writing up a notch? Would it have really been that hard?"
4,Captivating For Any Political & Religious Background,"Politically Intriguing, Spiritually Captivating, Surprising...or should I say Shocking. Also Mysterious & Wonderous, Thought Provoking... You get your Politics, Budding Romance, Thriller, & Spiritual Mystery all wrapped up in one. I highly Recommend it! Enjoy! :-)"
3,Just finished 1 and 2 of the series,"I just finished the first two books of this series after having my Amazon reccomendation center reccomend them and seeing them on the best seller list.I am not particularly ""Christian"" and as engaging as these books can be, they do come off at times as preachy.The story line is interesting, but the writing is not all that great and the preachy-ness is off putting at times.I am still trying to debate whether I finish this series. I would say that there are better books on the market right now to spend your time on. Don't get sucked in."
5,Don't Get Left Behind!,"""Left Behind"" is a great start to this series. What would you do if many of your friends and loved ones suddenly vanished from the face of the earth? Was it the workings of aliens, God, or the Russians?I have read a lot of the reviews posted here on this book. I, for one, am not going to make a feeble attempt to criticize the authors. I will, however, say that the book was one of the most enjoyable reads that I have experienced lately. It has become a real page turner for me and it actually has forced me to ask myself a lot of questions.I don't believe that this book is an attempt to ""convert"" anyone. I believe it designed to be thought provoking. If you read this for its christian beliefs or for its fictional value, be prepared to get wrapped up in it!"
4,The first is okay--the rest are wonderful.,"Okay--first of all, these books are meant to be fun, but inspiration as well. For those who did not like it, fine. But, I too found the first book a little dull. After reading the next two or so, I found myself going without food or coming out of my room because I could not put them down. My advice for those you did not like the first one, is to suffer through it and try the next one. If you are still not interested, okay. I could write about how they changed my life (and I am trying), but it is much more important that I tell you to keep trying. They get better, and better. Don't choose just ""one"" book by its cover.God be with you."
1,Intriguing Interpretation but Poor Writing,"I have to admit that I've read all of the books in the series because I'm interested in how the authors interpret latter days prophecy. However, these are some of the poorest written books I've read. These books are written for, perhaps, the sixth grade reading level. Of course, I know many children are reading heavy classics by that age, so I'm sure I'm being generous.I think that if you're starving for wholesome, Christian-minded books you might enjoy this series."
5,left behind,i just finished reading left behind. it was great... i couldnt put it down. i just ordered book number 2. i plan on reading them all. i hope tim lahaye and jerry jenkins continue to write more.
3,My thoughts on the first of the Left Behind Books.,"I bought this book for an international flight and found it enjoyable. It has not been as gripping as my usual Grisham novels. But It is a good book none the less. It gets stronger as it goes on, but could be more gripping in the beginning. What it lacks in suspense, it makes up for in its teaching method. Most will read it because of their faith. It will definately shed light on some forgotten areas. I look forward to book two which I have on order. I recommend this book to all..."
5,Not Just Another End Times Story!,"The best of this series from Lahaye & Jenkins, even though 'Left Behind' is my favorite. The following books in this series are weaker in plot and writing, but the story goes on. Whoever you believe in, Christ, Mohammad, or UFOs, this is a well thought out, researched, and imaginative book. Not every Christian will agree with every premise in this book, but that's not unusual. The characters, plot development, and mystery unfolds as you turn the pages. By comparison, Brad Steiger's new book 'Alien Rapture' is the alter-alternative to the Christian Rapture with a great sinister government woven in. The following books in this series after 'Left Behind' are not near as good. Being a student of theology, and believing that UFOs have something to do with 'The End Times', I have read both 'Left Behind' and 'Alien Rapture' books numerious times. I loan them out as a pair. Yes, indeed, buy it. Unusual and excellent reading"
4,A good book to bring your focus back to Christ,"I enjoyed the book. Reading about the characters living their Christian lives helped me to refocus my walk also. I left one star off, because I finished the book too quickly. I read through the whole thing in less than two days and felt like more. Get rid of the large margins and big spacing and give me more story."
4,"Entertaining, light reading for Christians","The books are not the best written, and there are both religious fantics, and reading fantic's that tear these books apart. But on the other hand, whether there will be pre-trib, or just trib, it's entertaining, and intersting story if you have an imagination, and does privide some backing verses from the Bible. I object to the cost, one book covered 2 weeks worth of events? (Maybe condense two books into one). I hope they finish the series before Rapture does occur. :o)"
5,Outstanding!,"Although this book is fiction, it depicts the rapture experience that is sure to come in such biblical accuracy."
5,I'm hooked,"Couldn't put it down. I have read some of the reviews from Amazon customers panning the book for its supposed mediocre writing style - I fear that those reviewers missed the entire point of the book. I read also a criticism of the supposed Proselytizing of the book - that reviewer missed the point, also. Perhaps it would be better to read the book of Revelation before being so quick to criticize. I found the book to be a remarkable adventure into 'what will be' when the Rapture occurs and the 7 years following. I immediately had to go and purchase the rest of the collection and am now on the third book, Nicolae. I highly recommend the series."
1,Edited from the original version,"I read this book shortly after it was released and I'm re-reading the Kindle version right now. Something I noticed today that is now incredibly jarring to me - all the mentions of Pastor Billings' VHS tape that he'd recorded have been changed to ""DVD"". Furthermore, when Rayford is taking stock of all the items that were taken in the break-in, he notices that iPods are missing - when they weren't in the original. I could ignore it easier if the editors hadn't done such a sloppy job - Rayford mentions wanting to leave the DVD ""in the VCR"", and that he'd ""rewound"" it for Chloe to watch later. Incredibly bad job. I keep wondering what else they've changed in the series to keep up with the times."
1,Flee from this garbage,"This whole series does nothing but promote a doctrine of devils. A true spiritual study of the Word tears up the so called theology used behind this tripe. If you are truly interested in growing spiritually, having a relationship with God, and understanding the truth concerning Jesus; I highly recommend ""Whose Right It Is"" by Dr. Kelley Varner. If you are only interested in titillating your mind with the imaginations of man, read ""Left Behind."" I hope to God my left behind is still planted right here when the church comes to its fullness in Christ (Eph 4:11-13). I was chosen by Jesus to ""bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain"" (John 15:16)The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.(Proverbs 10:30)Once again, I recommend ""Whose Right It Is"" by Dr. Kelley Varner. It will truly help you if you are sincerely seeking the truth and are a true worshipper of God."
4,Entertaining Christian story,Ok - so the writing might not be the best and you can pick holes in the sense of it all - but then that's true of plenty of sci fi / future / imaginative literature.I love this series though - highly entertaining to see the liberal/left being made the villains of the piece for a change. I love the way they whinge and whine in their reviews about the overtly Christian themes of the book: as if they are the only ones allowed to write fiction promoting their world view. You can bet that if it was a muslim text promoting its faith they would be falling all over it! But since it's Christian it is in their eyes by definition hateful.
1,Dogmaric to the core...,"As the other reader, I am astonished to see that these clumsy dogmatic series became bestsellers! I could understand if they had an engaging plot, compelling characters, etc. These books should be rather filed under ""non fiction""...Myself being a Christian, I watch with extreme disappointment at this type of dogmatism marginalizing Christianity further and further out. It is truly ironic how preachers of the first truly supranational religion digress into plain xenophobia... Everything global comes from Antichrist - the Net, Euro, WTO, what else? I suggest you go back and watch Omen all over, it will be more fun. Alternatively, I would suggest C.S. Lewis's Cosmic Trilogy as tolerant Christianity - or Good Omens by Gaiman and Pratchett - for fun and enjoyement."
1,Not Great Literature,"This book is preaching disguised as a suspense novel. As many other reviewers noted,it is poorly written,especially when it comes to dialog. As evidenced by the lack of editorial reviews, it seems not to have been reviewed as a work of literature. It doesn't leave room for addressing any religious beliefs other than Christianity - in fact, other religions are not even discussed in the book. I assume many in India, for example, are left behind, and their only option according to the authors would be to convert from their long-held religious beliefs to Christianity. In short, I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Easily one of the worst books I've ever read,"This book no more made me believe in the Rapture than aFrisbee would make me believe in UFOs. The writing is more hackneyedand simplistic than most romance novels (the main character is named""Rayford Steele""!) and the plot is just a boilerplate retelling of the most paranoid Christian fantasies. I know people who say they love these books, and I really truly pity them."
3,Entertaining Beginning Scuttled By Not-So-Subtle Agenda,"Most bookstores categorize this series as ""Inspirational Fiction."" That means it is fiction mixed with what the author's believe, and want you to believe, is ""The Truth."" The novel is filled with fun but naive views of world politics. The authors hook you with about 200 pages of action before hitting you with the scripture. The author's try to be subtle, but this is definitely agenda-driven fiction. The devil's advocate parts with the non-believers is a funny and unsuccessful attempt to look objective. If you're a Christian, this is a celebratory ""told-you-so"" romp (as evidenced by all the ""Teen Tribulation Force"" web sites). If not, it is still a good story mixed with a crusade agenda."
5,Reading More,"I quietly read this book in less than 8 hours. As a new Christian, it fed me what I was hungry to know, just like the characters in the book. I remember hearing about morality plays during the Shakespearean era. This is a morality work with present day relevance. Eat it up, then...pass it on!"
1,A piece of god-awful filth,"Not only does this series hammer in its political opinions and ""we're-right-you're-wrong-so-no-pity-for-you"" religious persona (far removed from most Christians), this book has terrible pacing, serious problems concerning character morality and far more space devoted to telephone conversations than either evangelism or action. It tells when it should show, forgets when it should forgive and generally lacks any redeeming feature.I laughed at one point while reading, when one of the Mary Sues hit his head in a genre-busting bit of slapstick. Even though he should have been injured enough to seek some sort of medical help (""his hair matted down with blood""), this scrape is ignored and promptly forgotten.Bad characterization, clumsy theology and a bit of a bore. Don't read this series as it is a waste of time."
2,Fundamentalist Fiction,"This series describes itself as fiction, and it is truly that. If you only read it at that level, and expect merely to pass the time, then it certainly will do no harm. But the writers intend more than that--they want it to evangelize. They believe that the silly narrative they weave, of dematerializing bodies, will actually happen. These are the teachings of the fundamentalist Protestant philosophy of ""Dispensationalist Premillennialism."" Catholics and Mainline Protestants will realize that it is based on a literalistic reading of the Book of Revelation, which ignores the actual context in which Revelation was written. LaHaye and Jenkins think that when Revelation speaks of giant locusts attacking the earth with stinging tails, that this will literally occur! Given such silliness, one must wonder why the books are selling as well as they are."
1,Wish There Was Such A Thing As 0 Stars,"I consider myself to be a very good Christian. I go to church regularly, and help out the best I can. But this book is terrible. I'm sorry to say, but it is very poorly written. It is for Christians who are afraid of going to hell. It's silly! If you know you're a good person, you shouldn't worry yourself about whether or not you'll make it. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
5,It was fantastic,"I am on book number 4 Soul Harvest. The books to this series is fantastic. If you want action and adventure, I encourage you to read this book. This book series has everything to it."
5,Great book!,"Rayford Steele, an airline pilot, doesn't believe in all the Christian talk he's been hearing from his wife, Irene. She's tried telling him of the Rapture and the Tribulation, but Rayford turned deaf ears toward her. While flying his passenger-loaded airplane one night, a quarter of the passengers dissappear. Rayford realized then that what Irene had told him was true - Christ had come, and he'd been left behind.I absolutely LOVE this book. Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins present the Bible prophecies of the Rapture in ways that we can understand them. And not only that, they make it interesting! The book is loaded with action as Rayford, his daughter Chloe, Bruce Barnes, and Cameron ""Buck"" Williams befriend each other and prepare to go through the Tribulation together."
5,It grabs you from the first word and does not let you go.,"My wife and I began reading this book together and have been unable to put it down. We have only stopped reading when sleeping, eating or work demanded otherwise. It is one of the most intriguing, suspenseful books I have read in years."
2,Why so popular?,"I just finished reading Left Behind and while I think the whole premise could have made a very interesting story I think this was just plain boring. I couldn't help but feel that the authors were trying to justify why certain religious groups feel the need to knock on strangers' doors and try to preach to them. I also felt that there might have been a touch of anti-semitism in this book and even though I'm a Catholic, I couldn't help feeling a little annoyed at this sentiment. In conclusion, this could have been an excellent book, but maybe it needs to cut down on the preaching and delve a little more into character development."
4,Pretty fair reading. Though slanted to one viewpoint.,I thought the relationships were a little simple minded but it was still readable. I liked Steiger's new end times 'Alien Rapture' which fits my own personal beliefs. Pick a view point and you can find a book on it on amazon.com. This is a pretty good book.
2,"Nice story, but very short in the fact dept.","LaHay and Jenkins are getting good reviews not by the literary community, but rather the senselessly devout Christian community who represent the overwhelming majority of their audience: They are preaching to the choir. Their story is long on imagination, faith and occult and very short on fact, authenticity and legitimacy. I gave it two stars because I liked the style and added zero more for substance."
5,Brilliantly heart touching,This book was the best book I've ever read. It was so suspensful and adventuring that I couldn't put it down
3,Can't say much for the theology... but I still read them all,"I've read all the but most recent in the ""Left Behind"" series... and I'm living proof that one doesn't have to be a premillenialist to enjoy these kinds of books. In my opinion, although I'm probably not quite qualified to give it, the theology in this book is poor, but it sure helps one understand the premill/pretrib stance on eschatology. I could not put any one of these books down! The ""theology"" is a nice work of fiction and its called _Left Behind_ if that makes any sense at all. If you want a quick read, pick up these books- you can read them all in a week. They are full of excitement, action, and characters we genuinely care about. Even if you disagree with the theological position they take, you can still enjoy the books. Yep, that's what I spent so many words trying to say."
3,"Great concept, idiotic story telling.","First of all, I'm a Christian and thus am fascinated by the Revelation concept here, but other than biblical scholarship it seems that no research or homework went into this book.The characters are incredibly shallow and one dimensional,I couldn't care less about any of them,and the dialog seemed like it is written by a 12 year old.These stories do provide a very interesting backdrop for biblical prophesy and I have to admit that I will probably read the whole series, although I may need to plug my nose while doing it.It's really amusing how many reviews are five stars here. Let's face it folks,the emperor has no clothes,the writing stinks.It's the concept that interests us."
2,Subject matter has been done better elsewhere.,"The subject matter of this book has been done with much better style and grace in other books such as "" The End "" by Matt Ronan or ""Next : A Poetic Odyssey "" by Lee Frank."
4,Helped me with my priorities,"This book made me realize I spend too much time worrying about things that are not really important and got me thinking about what I should be working on right now. I read this book in one day, and the next book ""Tribulation Force"" in the next three (and I only had time to read it in the mornings and evenings). I am about to read the third book and want to read the entire series, even though that seems a little daunting. The first two books did seem to end suddenly, thus requiring one to continue through the series, which does make me wonder about the authors' motivation after ""Left Behind."""
5,The best I've read in years!,This book brings forth the reality in the Book of Revelations. It's dynamic and will force anyone who reads it to question where they will spend eternity.
4,Reflecting of the end,"I really enjoyed this book and its contents, making me reflect on my christianity. I know that the end may be near, which this book really puts it in perspective for me, that us as christians need to rethink how we are so obliviant to the fact the end could come at any time. When Ryans' dad was on the phone with Ryan, he told Ryan ""Your mom didn't make it"". That really saddens me that will really happen to kids, and their parents who are non-christians who will spend eternity in hell, who dont know the true love of God."
4,Last Days,This book starts on the day of rapture and lets us into the lives of a few who were left on earth. And then follows the obvious chaos that engulfs the world as everyone tries to understand how millions of people disapeared at the exact same time. Some of these people find their faith and turn to God. While we watch the rest of the world is entranced by the rise of the Anti-Christ.This book is a page turner that I read in one day. It is full of suspense. Its swift pace focusses on world events as well as on personal experiences of a few people. We see how those few people we follow who are rational and logically minded make their decisions on whether or not they believe they are in the end times.
5,EXCELLENT BOOK,Very quality writing and storytelling. I have renewed my christian faith as I want to be one who disappears. I am so excited Ray and Buck have decided to follow Christ. Excellent everyone should read this book.
4,A well-written call to faith and accountability.,"Capt. Rayford Steele's fantasy of an affair with a beautiful, but dim flight attendant is ended with the screams that followed the disappearance of 1/3 of his passengers on his night flight. This hardened, skeptic is forced to reconsider the warnings of his wife about something called a ""rapture"" and begins to wonder if she is also gone. Upon landing, he finds that chaos reigns and that his believing wife and son are gone. All that is left of his family is his college-student daughter who shares her fathers unbelief. His quest to reunite with his daughter, his pilgrimage to faith & finding a new family among the remnants of his wife's church who are embarassed to have been left behind combine to grip your attention, holding you to the last page and leaving you ready for the sequel. This story fleshes out this part of Revelation very well."
3,Really-just OK,Though the story is heavely based upon religion-the story was believable. Reminds me of another series I read a long time ago. Good read-kept my interest.
3,Entertaining and Ridiculous.,This book is based on the Bible book of Revelation. Which is in my opinion the absolute worst book in the bible. Having said that I did find the book entertaining. You don't have to agree with the authors to get swept up in the narrative. They should use their talents on more believable subject matter.
5,Really Enjoyed,I thought that this book was a real eye opener and a very good read! It will certainly get you to thinking about your sprituality.
4,Spellbound fiction,"I LOVED this book. It all starts off with a normal, everyday person at work. He is a pilot and he has to deal with the emotion, and stress when people just disappear from his airplane (and from around the world.) It has several real life charaters that has to deal with this end-of-the-earth days. Many of which don't seem to understand what has happened. It is a gripper with a slightly slow period in the first 1/4 of the book. However it makes up for it in the twist and turns that you don't see coming. It includes the basics of the last chapter in the Bible. It is wonderful to have some fiction that is based on the bible. It is not a replacement for the Bible. And it should not give anyone the ideal that this is what the bible says exactly. But it is great for a fun loving drama fiction that keeps you on your seat. I think even a non-believer would love this book."
5,It grabs you and holds your attention,"The first few pages reach out and grab you, as people just disappear, leaving behind their clothes, glasses, jewelry, even the fillings from their teeth; leaving behind confused and frightened loved ones. The pace of events continues not only thru this book, but the entire series (well, I'm up to #3 in the series, and logged on today to order all the rest).I've bought four copies of this for family and friends. SPREAD THE WORD!"
2,Disappointing book with silly plot,"First off, I am a Christian, and although I'm not quite finished with this book, and I've already decided that I won't be reading the rest of the series. While ""Left Behind"" is a pretty good read, I'm finding the plot to be so convoluted that it's hard to really believe. The plot drags and the characters are so thinly developed that I don't really care if they get saved or not, although I did do a mental cheer when Rayford accepted Jesus as his Saviour, but I saw that coming from Page 1 so it was no surprise. I'm hoping that it's just because it's a multi-book series and that LaHaye and Jenkins will develop the characters more in later books. I was really looking forward to reading the entire series--it came highly recommended by some friends--that all I can say is that I'm really disappointed."
5,A Masterpiece,"I read alot, but never have I read a book like this one. In every book I'd read up til this point, there was at least one part that I was tempted to skip. This is the first I've read in which that didn't happen. A marvel, this book should be on everyone's favorite book list."
2,Left behind,This book was a VERY slow read for me. It was very simple at best and the characters were so ordinary that I never really connected with them . The story was also quite predictable with absolutely NO twists and/or turns. Not a good reading experience for me.
2,Disappointed,"A friend of mine loaned this book to me, raving about the story. The packaging on the book is well done and makes it appear as if it's much bigger than it truly is. Upon reading though, I found the book to lack the depth that I presumed was there. The characters are very flat, the writing is juvenile at times, but the plot kept me going.There is so much potential in the story here, but I don't feel the writers have taken the time with their work to polish it and add depth to their work. It looks as if they're kicking two of these books out per year, which leads me to believe they're more interested in churning them out rather than creating a quality piece of fiction.Still, I keep reading them. The plot is just enough to keep me moving forward. I do see the agenda in these books, and as a Catholic, I feel somewhat offended by this. I feel like they've done a lot of stereotyping in the series."
5,great book makes you think what if it happen now.,"this book goes along with revalations in the Bible.But with a more story line to it. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. As to what will happen next.Makes you want to read the whole set.You see the world moving towards the end of time, as we know it, and the start of a different life coming."
2,2 Stars: Generous.....,"A while back, I wanted to see what all the fuss what about the ""Left Behind"" series of books. So, I picked up the first few books and read through them in about a week. I soon realized this purely speculative rendition of the end times was mildly entertaining, but that was about it. I think this book, and the following editions amount to interesting books about the same level of writing as stories about gunfighters in the old west. The very fact that Lahaye is profiting off his version of the book of Revelation is slightly alarming, but this is the USA, and he can do, as he pleases.With all that said, this book was mildly entertaining, but purely speculative in nature. It seems every 100 years someone figures out this is going to be the end of time, and they can prove it.I wish Tim Lahaye would get back to teaching people how to study the bible, and less about worrying about the end of time. C-Joseph Dworak"
5,In One Instant.....................................,"Imagine if in One Instant millions around the globe disapear,leaving just their clothes behind......Imagine, Complete chaos everywhere as people try to survive,and there's one question left unanswered,Why?And Where is everyone????That's exactly what Cap.Rayford Steele thought as half the people on the 747 he was piloting disapeared......That's also what jornalist Cameron Williams-otherwise known as Buck-Wonders to....Then,One Man who claims to have the answers suddenly rises to power,he has his own story,and Many believe it,but Rayford and Buck have to search fo the truth,and they're family's.........."
1,"Dumb Story, Silly Plot","Not an interesting read, dumb plot. It's hard to believe that educated people believe this nonsense.Let's put two things together and see what we come up with. First, when bodies are buried, they begin to rot. Within a few months, a buried body turns to bones. Second, these bodies are supposed to resurrect to be with Jesus one day when he returns. Conclusion, rotted bodies are one day going to come out of their graves and float into the sky. I don't know about you but this sounds like a pretty frightening prospect and would be better described as a revised plot for Night of the Living Dead."
1,If I could give it less than one star I would,After hearing all the hype about this book my expectations may have been a little high. But I think my disappointment would have been as great even without the buildup. One reviewer pointed out that it was written for the 'low brow' crowd - readers of Clancy and Grisham were mentioned. I would have to disagree - this book is *much* worse than Clancy and Grisham. In fact it is the worst writing I've seen published. It may well be true that the story is exciting - but if you are used to grammatical and syntactically correct writing you might not be able to continue reading long enough to judge.
1,Warning... for evangelicals only.,"Being a fan of end of the world type writing, I bought this at a used book store during my vacation after quickly reading the back cover. Missing a couple words on the summary was my downfall as this book is basically an evangelical message all the way through. I thought it was a bit odd how a christian conversion was mentioned heavily in the first few pages. After further reading i was dismayed to find this is an evangelical sstory and series...and a roughly written one at that. i gave up after about 100 pages. The early premise is based on israel being attacked by russia after israel creates a fertilizer that allows them to grow stuff anywhere. Why would russia attack over that? The poorly laid premise just allows the author to get into the heart of the religious message about a group that is trying to convert and save christians for the end of the world. religious folks will probably love it...everyone else, avoid this."
3,Interesting but very trite.,"Ok, I can appreciate this take on Armageddon but honestly, the story line gets old...fast. The authors could have condensed this series into 1 long book but obviously that is not the way one makes money.For the Christian reader, Left Behind will keep you entertained but I am hesitating to sell this as a crowd pleaser, even for cheerleaders of the Christian genre. For the general book lover, this book will feel trite and irritating."
1,Leave this false teaching behind...,"Leave this false rapture teaching behind. Read Carl Olson's ""Will Catholics be left behind?"" Totally debunks the ""Rapture"" and these books."
5,An exciting look at the rapture!,"A pilot and a reporter's life's collide when millions around the world disappear. Reporter Buck Williams and pilot Ray Steele come together to find the truth about the disappearances. This book contains adventure and excitement with a bit of romance. It is a look into the lives of regular people when an extraordinary event occurred. It teaches people about respect, love and hope.The book is a fast and easy read that is hard to put down. The book also causes you to look at your own life and question what you believe. This religion based book is good for all teens and adults looking for an answer to life's questions. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."
2,Not what I expected,"Although the story itself is interesting. How could it not be? The Rapture? However, despite that and some very suspect conclusions about how everyone would react to such an event, the one thing that I didnt like was the writing. It was not very good and the characters were totally unsympathetic and unbelievable. I wanted to like this novel, but it was not to be. If you want end of the world stories by those who can write, try Earth Abides, Day of the Triffids or even The Stand. Stephen King's writing towers over these two."
3,A little shallow but intriguing,"This pilot experiences the ""Rapture"" while flying his 747 and after being forced to return to Chicago he must face his worst fears. His saintly wife and son have been taken and he and his analytical/sceptical daughter have been left behind. While I enjoyed the speculative nature of the story and even go so far as to compare it to C.S. Lewis's ""The Great Divorce"", it's characters lack depth and are to predictable. I can see this playing to the fears/arogance of Fundamentalist but not to those who belive that Christ knows where we live. I do however intend to read and encourage others to read the series because it does remain faithful to the Bible and that can never be wrong. I just wish we had gotten to know the ""Saints"" who were taken."
4,Just get through it!,"I first borrowed this book from a friend, and have since read all its sequals. It took me a while to get in to it, but everyone kept telling me how good it was. I finaly did finish and I'm glad. It sets the seen for all the other books and, in my opinion, they get progressively better. I'm hooked like the millions of others out there and am impatiently waiting for the next one to come out. So if you can just stick with it you'll be very happy you did!"
4,page turning and spellbinding,This book should be made into a movie!! I couldn't put it down. What a great way to get information to non christians ... I gave my life to the lord after reading it!
1,Pseudo-Christian pornography,"This kind of writing suffers from a condition once described as ""taking literally what was meant metaphorically, while taking metaphorically what was meant literally"". This series is an example of both defects at once. If taken at all seriously, it is an intellectual and spiritual insult to Christians and non-Christians alike, and it reduces religion itself to an idiotic who's in, who's out fraternity initation rite with a pornographic obsession with imagining another's damnation. Read it as you might read Mein Kampf: just to experience how a dangerously wacky mind works. But it is so thoroughly trashy, that even at that level it is hard to stomach."
1,Left Behind,"An unusual story that's not for most readers. It's based upon the controversial ""rapture of the church"" and the ""tribulation"" that follows. (To learn more about these 2 subjects you can search the web.) I found the story that revolved around the Investigative Newspaper Reporter interesting. However, the story that revolved around the Airline Pilot spent to much time preaching the virtues of religion. Thus the story was dragged out too long. And if you are not deeply religious you are certain to find the preaching overwhelms the story. Lastly, the first book ended in the middle of a climactic scene. This was surely done to interest you in buying the next book, however, I'll pass."
3,Absolutely succeeds in what it sets out to do.,"LEFT BEHIND is poorly written, but it's easy to read and surprisingly hard to put down. The text is scripturally sound according to what I was always taught in church regarding ""the end times."" The book blasts the reader with too much negativity, but that goes with the territory. I read LEFT BEHIND, the first in the series, to see why the series is so popular -- and I found out! When you close the book you're ready to start the next one! The authors make no apology for their blatant proseletyzing. That's the book's whole purpose. It successfully incorporates actual Biblical prophecy (as the authors interpret it) with ""What if"" scenarios. It's all very cleverly done, and is at times tense and page-turning. I'm assured that subsequent books in the series are better written. The authors did what they set out to do. And I must say, in the annals of Christian fiction this is the best at what it tried to achieve."
1,Poorly done.,"In their LEFT BEHIND series, Lahaye and Jenkins try to make their readers feel better about the ""end times."" I'm sure that their books have turned many hearts toward Christ, but I find them to be very poorly done. The plot races along, leaving everything else in the book behind. The characters are undeveloped and are more like stock characters than real people. I've listened to intelligent people talk about these books--how terrific and ""well written"" they are. It makes me sad to think that these people, college-educated,professional people, can't tell the difference between good, polished writing, and a glossy-covered freshman English writing exercise."
1,The book of Revelation goes commercial,"This is a poorly written book. To call it a novel raises its credibility too high. This book reads like an 8th graders interpretation of an ""end-times"" Babptist sermon. Don't waste your money when you can get this message for free at any fundamentalist church."
1,A poor meal of a book,"Is this book were a meal, it would be a bowl of water thin apologetic soup, some hard cheese literalism, a club-you-over-the-head morality sandwich, a side of paper-thin character chips with a heaping bowl of word salad, to go.Although it definitely leaves a stong taste in your mouth, it's just not very filling."
4,A nice read,"The book is a nice read and I would recomend anyone to put on their kindle for when you have some time on your hands,sitting by the pool on holiday ect."
5,All should read and heed,"I have read each book in the ""Left Behind"" series. I am an avid believer in the Bible and that it is the inspired word of God. I have come to believe that the ""Left Behind"" series, (though it's characters are fictional, it's foundation is Biblical,) is an ""INSPIRED"" writting. I would highly recommend this series to anyone, believer or not, who is in search of the truth about how things are to be in the end times. If, like myself you have ever read the book of Revelations but did not understand it, this series will bring what you have read to light. If you read this series with an open mind and a searching heart, it will inspire you too..."
5,Truely super and inspiring!,"While reading this book I was doubtful at first. The term ""christian fiction"" put me off it almost at once, but I decided to lay judgment aside and read it as objectively as possible. Almost immediately I as swept off my feet by this book. It touched me deeply and there were several moments in which I almost came to tears. Some of the details were so horrific yet it all added to the drama. I was impressed. I admit, the only down side to the book is that it preaches to you, quite a lot, but it also has seriously got me thinking about the future. As i read in another review, these authors have really done their homework. I recommend this book for readers from 14 and older. I loved it. I am extremely interested in reading the rest of the series, and when I do, i hope that J&L have kept up their excellent work.Congratulations J&L on an excellent book."
1,"Locustchopters,microchips and demons oh my!!!","The left behind series is equal to the star trek series on TV. Highly entertaining but not much truth. Starting with this book and throughout the entire series many assumptions are made on scripture, but yet proclaimed as truth. Ever seen the word ""microchip"" in the bible? Neither have I.For entertainment purposes this is a fun series, but the way the authors and the boys from DTS< Dallas Theological Seminary> have pushed this book as being not that far from the truth.Lahaye has taken a relatively new perespevitve on eschatology, which is pre millennial dispensationalism, and has ""brainwashed"" over 65 million readers into believing that dispensationalism has always been there from day one.A honest one on one with your pastor or a brief study in Church History shows a way different approach to eschatology<last things>>.So sit back, have a good laugh and don't worry about demons in helicopters attacking you in the near future."
1,"Reminded me of L.Ron Hubbard's ""science fiction""","I bought this book because the premise looked interesting, and thought it might be an complex, intelligent science fiction story. Instead, I found that the characters were poorly developed, the writing was not very sophisticated (long portions of the story are told by long speeches with no logic or explanation) and the dialogue was contrived (e.g., there is a random anti-abortion passage that is plopped into the story with no context). Very disapppointing, considering this could have been a good story."
1,THE PROPAGANDA MINISTERS HAVE STRUCK AGAIN,"This book is written like a propaganda minister would've written about the Jews in WWII Germany. It is arrogant, self-serving, demonizing tripe, and it's pseudo-intellectual rants made me feel like the authors were signing me up for Sunday services. This book is not dangerous unless you believe that this will actually happen. If that's the case, I suggest you read Carl Sagan's ""A Demon-Haunted World."" Maybe then you'll learn something about the world you live in."
1,Insult to human intelligence!,"What a load of bunk. It is even a waste of time to write a review. As mentioned in other reviews, bad writing, ridiculuos plot and insult to all religions and intelligence."
2,Christianity is not the only religion,"I was intrigued with the concept and somewhat enjoyed the narrative, but after finishing it, I felt as if I had just been preached to by a propagandist. I am catholic and I suggest you DO NOT read this book. If races were substituted for the religions in this book, it would be the most racist book I ever read. Jews and Muslims are the enemies to salvation. Buddhists are somewhat spared because they believe that there once was a prophet named Jesus. Russia as the evil empire? Please. Even good, god-loving people do not experience the rapture because they have not been ""born-again."" This is a dangerous cult in the making and the weak and the shallow will flock to it."
4,This book is very exciting and interesting,The book Left Behind is great for kids my age. Jud learned that you can't get to heaven unless you believe in Jesus. It explains that you should listen to your parents because they only want the best for you.I'm looking forward to reading the next book in this great series.
3,Please. . .,"This pablum is just too Jerry Falwell to be enjoyable. The real nail-biting, hard-edged, gutsy and challenging stuff is in doomsday novels like Kleier's THE LAST DAY, or Crichton's THE END OF THE AGE--although THE LAST DAY is infinitely better than AGE. You want the real thing, something with teeth and honesty, read LAST DAY and leave this milktoast to the orthodontically challenged."
4,"The best, but too long!","I just finished the 1st book, and I only read it because my dad( who is a paster). I thought that it would be a boring book, but then I really got hooked in to it. It was probubly the best book that I have read in a long time. Iam definetly going to read all the rest of the series."
2,With God Nothing is Impossible?,"I'm not saying I didn't think the book was bad, but I just feel that is was a little implausable. The idea of a whole fleet of aircraft being destroyed by a storm is a little out there, but still it could happen. The fact that a man could rise from nothing to become a world leader. It's possible. But I have to draw the line on the UN wanting to move to ""New Babalon."" That's just my spin on it. I also want to say that I can't wait to get my hands on the next book."
5,Convicting and inspiring interpretation of Revelation!,"While the book is fictional in the setting, characters, etc; it gives an excellent interpetation of the book of Revelation (though this is JUST THE START!).I am not an avid reader, but this book grabbed me and held me until the end. I was counting hours until I got off work to be able to read more!I just finished Tribulation Force, and am in Nicholae, and it just keeps getting better!You do not have to believe all that is in this book or The Book, but one day ""every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord."""
3,"Starts slow, but ends big","Putting the religious implications aside, the book starts with an eye-opener (the Rapture) but then slows down quite a bit until near the end, when it picks up in speed and action. All in all, I thought it was a pretty good work of fiction. After reading many of the other reviews, it seems many people have forgotten this is only a work of fiction, not a prophesy, or an addendum to the Bible. If you believe this book is THE TRUTH, you may as well believe the Aliens series, or the Star Trek series. They're fiction, too. I find it hard to believe the Lord would completely ignore the millions of people who don't believe in Christ as the savior. What happens to all the Chinese, Japanese, Jews, Africans, Hawaiians, etc? I guess they're all Left Behind. The authors obviously found their pot of gold and are milking it for all it's worth (12 books by 2002, and a guaranteed reader base=much money). It's fiction folks, calm down."
5,Makes you ask yourself the most important ? ARE YOU READY?,"I believe that the Authors have one great evangelistic series for everyone. I could not put the book down and now my husband is reading it. I am on my way out the door to go buy the rest of the books. I am a christian and I pray everyday that my name is in the ""Book of life"" ""Hi-lighted"" for the day of the rapture, I hope others will do the same! This BOOK IS GREAT!"
3,"Interesting premise, poor execution","This is a fictional story about an ancient mythical cult whose prophecies actually come true. All of the cultists disappear in the first chapter. An interesting premise, but the authors' descriptions of the event aren't convincing. I couldn't find a single character to identify with. As the first book of a series, it spends a lot of time setting up the rest of the series. Because so much time is spent setting up the series, this book doesn't read very well as a stand-alone novel. I was hoping for a protagonist who would make L Ron Hubbard's Xenu look like a saint. Perhaps in one of the later books; I won't be reading them so I'll never find out. If you are looking for a good novel about the apocalypse, I would recommend ""Good Omens"" by Terry Pratchett or ""Mercury Falls"" by Robert Kroese instead."
1,Show me some Truth!,"I have found that in the past Tim Lahaye has had a lot of Good things to say. But here is a good question for everyone who has read the book. Is that really the GOD you serve and Love? I think NOT! I could hardly even make it through the book because to be honest with you, if that is the kind of God I have now come to love, I would turn my back on HIM and Hope to Burn in hell forever. ( I MEAN THAT) This book talks about a GOD that does not exist. The God I know is Loving as a matter of fact my Bible says "" God IS love."" this book has a very demented thinking on the last days. I think Lahaye and Jenkins need to go Back and study Revelations again. After they figure out God IS NOT Schitzophrenic. I do belive in the rapture and so on... but I believe that God has more influential power than the evil one of this world. God is not setting out to destroy everything he created especially me and you. God truly does love his children unconditionally with unfailing grace."
5,Great book!.... regardless of Toilet Paper Pastor's opinion.,"I've read all seven books(so far) in the series. This first one, of course, sets up the storyline for the rest. The ending of this book is so great, you'll not be able to wait to get your hands on the next one!So, let the ""career"" college student and pastor(?) have his minority opinion. Myself, I've studied the Bible for some 23-years, and have read numerous Bible prophecy scholors. I've read nothing thus far in the LEFT BEHIND series that would detract from the meaning or correct interpretation of the Book of Revelation. If anything, you'll gain a better understanding of Bible prophecy."
1,Gutter culture trash,This book does nothing more than glorify fairy tales the gutter culture trash of our society try and use to molest our children. Utter trash.
5,The beginning of the end...,"A dramatically written series that has touched millions world wide, the Left Behind saga is a story that tries (and in my opinion, accomplishes) to set up the Biblical version of the End Times, which is largly found in relevations.The characters in this book all come from very diverse backgrounds, but are brought together through the power of God, to try to live as a community of fugitives. By reading this book, you almost feel as if you are experiencing the characters' pain, so great is the writing here. This, hands down, is the best End Times series I have ever read, and perhaps the best Christian Series as well. Your faith with God will be nothing but stregnthened by this book, and I implore you to give it a chance!!!"
5,Definently a life changer!,I'm 14 years old and decided to read this book for extra credit in school. This book really got me excited about God. I feel compelled to tell everyone I know about the Rapture and how close it really is. This week I'm giving an oral report at my school about this book! I can't wait to read Tribulation Force!
5,This is definitely a soul searching book,"When my cousin told me about this series of books I was at first skepitcal about it, but I purchased it and read it in 3 days. I couldn't put the book down I had to go out and buy the rest of the series. This series will make you stop and think about what the future holds and makes you stop and think about how you are living your life. The book is very well written, and puts the book of Revelation in a way that a person, Christian or not, can relate to...I have recommended this book to several friends and family members. This series has made me want to do my own research on the Bible and learn more about the end times. I've read the Bible through out my life, but going back and reading it after the series has made me pay more attention to the details that the Bible reveals to you.. This series is Awesome..."
3,Very entertaining,"A very dear friend of mine recommnended the series to me, and since I have always been a fond reader of ""end of the world"" literature, I was eager. I found the book, and the second one, very entertaining, but I must agree with other customers as to the wordiness of the text. I feel the story and all essential items could be kept, while still trimming a bit of the, shall we say ""teachings."" I'm not sure what the authors are trying to do with the series...merely entertain, or inform and convert all their readers. It seems they waiver between the two. It might be bit a bit more helpful if their intention was clear either way. However, as to their writing ability, I have no complaints. The action keeps moving, the characters are extremely well defined, and the suspense factor was definitely present. I look forward to the rest of the series."
5,Best Christian fiction series I have ever read!,I have read all but the newest book in this entire series and I think the authors have done a superb job of mixing fiction with Scripture and Spiritual truth. The characters are believable and become so real. All of these books make a person realize the importance of knowing the Word and accepting Jesus as Savior. All of this is done in novels that are action-packed. They are page-turners. God bless you Tim and Jerry! WONDERFUL!
3,"Catchy, but lacks depth.","This is definately an intriguing book, and it goes fast. I think the subject could be fleshed out a little more and the characters seem to be a bit unbelievable. Other than that, I enjoyed the book. As a Christian I appreciated the message as well. I would prefer a little more action and a little less ""soap opera""."
3,Theologically Heavy-Handed Thriller,"I discovered ""Left Behind"" in a book store and later purchased it, intrigued by the concept. I though it might be in the line of Stephen King's ""The Stand"" or the Gregory Widen film ""The Prophecy""; using christianity as a mythology to add a structure to the story. As an agnostic, I enjoyed the good vs. evil plot line as well as how the various characters came together at the end. However, I found some on the plot to be thinly guised, heavy handed advertising for LaHaye and Jenkin's beleifs. If you can get past this, you'll probably enjoy the novel."
3,"Great premise, mediocre writing","This book was mailed to me by an anonymous friend who I'm sure felt I needed it and also knew I enjoyed to read constantly. I found the premise to be interesting and it kept my interest through to the end. Conspiracy always makes a good thriller and these gentlemen have done a good job of putting together a ""page turner.""I did find the writing to be of ""mass"" level and the characters to be shallow. I am going to buy the next book in the series but somehow I get the feeling that this is a series in the ""pulp novel"" vein that is designed to keep you on the edge and sell more books."
5,Great Christian read,Awesome! Loved this book and it was free. I wish amazon would have the other books in this series for free/ low prices :)
5,Best book I've read,Could not put this down. Made me really think about my life and how we need to daily grow closer to God. I want to know more!!
4,Left behind,Best book ever I took it ease really really really really really really good he was just wondering how ol
5,An edge-of-your-seat thrill ride,"This book keeps the reader on the edge of their seat. If I had not been a Christian before, this book would have scared me into it. It takes what's in the bible about the rapture and makes it real to the reader. I couldn't put it down."
2,Poorly Written Propaganda,"What I was hoping to be a gripping fictional account of the rapture turned out to be a poorly written piece of propaganda.Seeing others review it as well written is frustrating. The writing is flimsy and disjointed...not worthy of an honorable mention in a high school writing contest.A book with this plot could have been a spectacular work with a fresh view of Christian beliefs...instead I see it as just a cheap vehicle for an elitist and arrogant message.The idea that a great portion of the Earth's population will be ""left behind"" is, in my opinion, absurd. However, I respect that this concept is embraced by many.I also suspect that the very wide margins, large print and more than ample spacing between lines were used to add size and physical depth to the book...to make it appear more than it is."
1,You've Got To Be Kidding!,"Let me get this straight. This book is on the best seller list? How laughable! The story is simplistic and preachy, the characters one dimensional and unsympathetic, and the plot is sloppy and heavy handed. It seems to me the only reason this book was written was to push the authors' viewpoints on the rest of us. Basically what they're saying is, if you're not a Believer you're doomed to Hell for eternity. Give me a bloody break! Ridiculous from start to finish. Don't even waste your money and time on this turgid piece of writing. I would have given Left Behind a zero if it had been an option."
1,worst written book ever,"This has got to be the worst written book ever. But then what do you expect, anyone who actually belives this garbage isnt smart enough to know the difference."
5,Thought Provoking,This is an excellent book. I could not put it down even for a moment. It really makes you think. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series.
5,Absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!!!!,"By far the greatest representation of the RAPTURE of the CHURCH that I have ever read. Not only did I read this book in 3 days, but I purchased TRIBULATION FORCE and began reading it with the same ferver. The way the authors bring you into the story line is amazing. I feel I know each of the characters personally, even Nicolae Carpathia. This book is not just good reading, but MUST reading. I have loaned this book to my non-believing friends. They are enthrawled and ask me questions about the RAPTURE. What a wonderful way to SHARE the GOSPEL."
2,Gay subtext?,"Tim and Jerry can't write... or can they? These books are a hoot, and has anyone else noticed the hinted-at-but-never-consumated attraction between Buck and Rayford? After all, two guys trying to get right with Jesus can't come right out and hold hands! Perhaps the clumsy prose is only a clever disguise for some of the most delicious gay subtext this side of Dr. Pretorius. Christian fiction? Tim and Jerry may be grandmaster pranksters equal to Andy Kaufman himself!"
5,Life Changing,"This is the most Life changing book I have ever read. I can no longer sit on the fence with my beliefs, but must choose whom I will serve. I am the mother of 4 kids (10 & under) and finished this book in 3 days--I couldn't put it down! Can't wait to read the other 3 books."
2,"Not worth is, no matter what your religion","I am a firm Christian, so I have no problem with the message in this series. I do have a big problem with the quality. The first book isn't too bad, but it quickly goes downhill from there. The authors' dwindling effort and obvious absence of fresh ideas becomes insulting by the fourth book. For religous people like myself, this is an insult, and for non-religous people who are perhaps looking for God, this strikes me as the quickest way to kill that thirst for God. all these books are going to do is remind them of why they don't like religion. these books are NOT representative of my faith. A book like We All Fall Down tackles the same subject with intellegence, wit, and true drama. It puts Left Behind to shame. it's a real shame that these books are so popular, because the Christian faith is so much more intellegent and spiritual than these books even TRY to be."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK - YOU MUST READ!!!,"This is one of the best series I have ever read. It really is an eye opener. I borrowed the book from a friend of mine, and read it in less than 24 hours. The next day I went and bouught the next two books, finished them on the following day, and then went and got the forth book (finishing it the same day). It is excellent reading and I HIGHLY recommend it to both Christians and non-Christians. If you have put God on the backburner in your life, you won't after you finish reading this book"
5,Very Good!!!!!!!!,"This book was a perfect example of how to make religious material not boring. I was compelled of all the action and in depth decribtion of the characters. I am happy to announce that I will be going to church this Sunday because of this book. It made me rexamin my faith and i am a stronger Christian than ever. The characters were well thoughtout, as well as the decisions they made. The one thing that I was confused about was Nicolae, or the Antichrist. He seemed to have everyone and everything under his power, besides the strong believers that were left behind. I cannot wait to read the second book in this series along with the rest of them."
5,Great Series,"Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down until it was done. All the books are like that and I can't wait until the next one comes out. From a Christian or even non-Christian view, these books have an interesting plot, are suspenseful, and leave you hanging. Although this get's slightly annoying when you have to wait a few months for the next book to come out, it's highly worth it!!!"
2,Left Behind: Not a Very Good Book,"This book was poorly written, and the plot development was below average at best. The authors are extremely repetitive, and they present a very unbelievable Antichrist. I found it very hard to identify with the characters, and I thought the entire book was unrealistic. I would not recommend this book to anyone but a diehard fundamentalist Christian that can look past the bad writing."
1,I wanna be left behind,Is this what moronic evangelical Christians are reading? The Heaven's Gate cult made more sense. What absurd nonsense.
1,Pre-millenialist propaganda,"First of all, this book was horribly written. The narrative voice reminded me of someone who'd taken a formula writing class. Secondly, the view of the ""end times"" represented therein is a view of dispensationalist pre-millenialism which surfaced at the end of the 19th century; the theologians of that time found it heretical. Not only does dispensationalism take an extremely dogmatic approach to Biblical prophecy, but it also tends to reflect a Western Imperialist mindset. The Bible was a Middle-Eastern text, and Middle-Eastern Christians do not agree with dispensationalism. Especially since it tends to support the fascist state of Israel and the Zionist conquest which dispossesed millions of Palestinians and was responsible for great massacres. Ask a Palestinian Christian what s/he thinks about ""Left Behind"" and you'll probably receive an earful. This book's view supports an oppressive philosophy...."
1,Forgive me,"Until this book was published, I never realized just how un-Christian I was in my belief that the Prince of Peace really wanted to bring peace to the world. But now I've seen the error of my ways.Hopefull they'll make a movie of the book complete with mega-violence chest-bursting death and destruction so we believers can present a good witness to the world. Soldier on Christians!Is it too much to ask for a killer soundtrack, too?"
1,"Painful, patronizing, and obsolete","wow,it's amazing that so many people should not only enjoy these contrived, poorly written books, but actually beleive some crackpot prophecies from some paranoid 'shroomin' recluse from the year 1000"
1,Let's help the children,"When I was growing up in a fundamentalist religion, I had times when I would feel great fear frustration and pain. My religious training assured me that I could not go to God for help because I was bad and he really had some strong punishment in mind for me. When I discovered this all to be a lie, I discovered a source of love that could heal any pain. The authors and fans of this book are insuring that many children will feel as I did. Great work guys and girls."
1,Amazing!,"I haven't actually read this book, nor do I plan to do so, but I hope Ann from South Dakota can spare some time to tell us all how her husband manages to read any books without turning pages. This is truly a problem that has plagued those of us who read in bed throughout history. If this is truly possible, and especially if it is possible without moving your lips, I am willing to convert. Please Ann, write back and save me from being ""Left Below."""
2,It's Novel Religion,"As a believer I don't WANT to post anything but a positive review of a Christian-based book but in spite of the press, in spite of the decade it took to get all 12 books published in this series, the writing falls flat so many times. The 12 books, if made into a trilogy of three slightly-longer books, would have been tighter and a much better read. I'm afraid that weak writing and a story that was S-T-R-E-T-C-H-E-D into 12 volumes so obviously on purpose to sell books hurts our witness and makes it harder for other Christian fiction to enter the mix."
4,Atheists beware!,"What else could you expect from a novel about sinners who were not saved by God? In Left Behind, by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, in an instance, millions around the world disappear, leaving their clothing and their loved ones behind, bewildered. There was chaos everywhere as driverless cars and airplanes crashed, killing thousands more who were not saved. The novel focuses on three converts--Buck Williams, Rayford and Chloe Steele. These three and their pastor, Bruce Barnes, know the truth about the next seven years to come, the hard times they face, and the charismatic new leader everyone loves. Despite all the religious references, Left Behind keeps you on the edge of your seat. The way the two authors weave Buck, Chloe and Rayford's stories together leaves you thirsty for more. Which is good since you have 11 more books in the Left Behind series to quench your thirst."
1,Fast read---Bad message,"It's easy to hack the Bible for the sake of fiction and money, but to do it so amateurishly and to so artificially construct upon the book of Revelations is a sacrilege that might impress only the slowest of folk. This is all made up, people, with the most cringingly obvious stock characters, the cheapest of sentimentalism to substitute for faith, no real character development, completely ridiculous situations. On the plus side, it IS a fast read, mostly because there is no actual substance in to engage the mind or the soul. Now, the Bible states clearly right at the end of Revelations that for anyone to add to the things said in that book, change them, construct on them, substract from them in any way is a big no no. Read your Bible again, please. And don't substitute true faith for cheap crass commercialism."
1,Fascinating ideas written in dumbed-down language,"The authors have good intentions (and an agenda), but from the first page it's painfully obvious that they have no idea how to create suspense or compelling characters or how to write memorable dialogue. We're constantly told how intelligent and charismatic the main characters are, but we'll just have to take the authors' word for it because they don't know how to make language be anything but banal. I can't imagine who is buying this book and actually enjoying it!"
5,The book that started it all!,"With a clarity of theme that rivals 'The Triumph and the Glory' and 'Faith of My Fathers' for power and dedication to presenting GOOD role models to the reading public, Jenkins and LHayes' Left Behind captures the readers' hearts with heart-pounding depictions of the Rapture and the world left behind to face the judgements of Revelation."
3,"Despite Some Obvious Faults, a Very Good Read.","If one can overlook the authors' all-too obvious prejudice against abortion, frequently and tiresomely brought up, and the unrealistic avoidance of lying on the part of characters in situations wherein NOT lying would probably prove fatal in real life, then the remaining treatment of the world situation as it might be -- in line, closely, with Bible prophecy -- following a Pre-Tribulation Rapture... is gripping. Fascinating plot development and interesting characters. A page-turner! (These comments pertain to all five of the books so far published in the series.)"
4,The housework will wait!,"This was one of those books I just couldn't put down! I was especially interested in the aspect of the rapture and how it related to ancient prophecy. I found this book to be very informative from a Christian aspect and enthralling from a reader's viewpoint. I think this is a definite pageturner. I read it within two days, receiving harassment from my 15 year old daughter for constantly having my ""nose stuck in that book"". Highly recommended."
3,not great not bad just interesting,end times makes for a good story i think no matter who writes it. these writers seem like they'd be better pre school teachers than true adult themed authors.ive read them all now and each has a cliffhanger and it takes months to get the next book out... i mean they are good stories but too preachy too short and kinda dumb sometimes.most can finish each book in a week or maybe a weekend (they are that short)...if the idea of the story sounds good you'll prob wanna read it. however enjoying it is 50/50...i see the other reviews for this christ clone trilogy so maybe ill go that route...ive been waiting for the next book in this series so long i think ive just lost all interest
1,Do not be fooled!,Rapture is not even in the bible. It alludes to a third coming. Why is it telling about a third coming? Are Catholics the only ones who believe that he's coming back to judge the living and the dead? We are all going up together not in groups! If you are prejudiced against the Catholic faith then this is for you.I was suckered into thinking this was a great book till I read Revelations and Daniel again. Daniel may have already happened. Also Lahaye forgets about the woman in the sky. I guess they didn't read Revelations too closely.Nothing but fiction! Yes there will be trumpets but Christ isnt' coming to just take some people up. He'll be back to judge EVERYONE
3,"Once you get over the hump, it's a great book","I was enthralled by ""Left Behind""'s premise and found it to be an overall excellent book--for people that don't mind a middle section that seems to drag on into oblivion. It isn't entirely biblically correct, but it is still very Christian and won't offend anybody. Technically wonderful, but too boring. I hope that the authors clean this up in the continuations because if they do they'll have potential for an awesome series of books."
3,AVERAGE AVERAGE AVERAGE,"These books, although sending out the Word, are so average! Do the writers write to the lowest common denominator? Read the books to learn about the Bible, or just read the book of Revelation and learn it yourself. This is a book for people who are too lazy to read and study the bible themselves. Did I like it? Sure, it was OKAY, not the best. But I read it and may read it again when they get tired of reading it and decide to finish the series."
2,"A ""Concerned"" catholic","I enjoyed the first two books of these series. They were suspenseful, and did hold my interest. What I did not get, however, were the ""digs"" the authors had to make to the Catholic church. I thought this was unnecessary, and defeated the purpose of a ""Christian"" book. Catholics beware when reading these books that ""fundamentalists"" take the bible literally. Too bad the authors had to slip in their views of ""orthodox"" Catholics, they would have done very well with Catholics who are looking for some good, clean mystery-sci-fi type of books."
1,Don't Take This Book Too Seriously!!!,"If you want soap opera-style melodrama with a ""Christian"" twist, then maybe this series is for you. If you want the truth, then keep right on walking. I have studied Bible prophecy for the past 40 years, and though I do lean toward a belief in a ""catching away"" of believers (rapture) and a seven year tribulation on earth, this book is about 10 percent truth and 90 percent total balderdash. There is no reason to get so wrapped up in something that will not happen the way the authors describe. What we as Christian believers are to do is to live our lives loving the Lord and our fellow man and leave the rest to Him. I'm sorry I read this book, it was a waste of my precious time that could have been spent doing something productive."
1,"This Should be ""Left Behind""","Tacky, vulgar, stereotypical, bigoted, camp, written below an 8th grade reading level, superficial unbelievably wooden characters, poor plot development, dialog from a 1960's Doris Day movie, I could go on and on with the reasons this book should be avoided. The most important, I believe, is that it distorts Christianity into a sham fundamentalist caricature of the Good News of Jesus Christ. The language of prayer and redemption is so far removed from the teachings of Christ: to be saved or ""born again,"" according to this book, is a ""transaction"" with God. Transaction! Apocalyptic literature of the style in which the book of Revelation was written were surely meant to be prophetic but certainly not as prediction for actual future events. Please Lord save me from this book and from the evil therein masquerading as truth!"
1,"Great, hearty fiction","Is this supposed to scare people to Jesus? Or just put them into stitches from laughing so hard?? Anyone who believes this stuff needs to have their head examined.Instead of this drivel, I recommend something that will genuinely challenge you: The Age of Reason by Thomas Paine, a hero of the American Revolution."
5,Powerful!!!,"Reading ""Left Behind"" gets you to thinking about the possibilities and it has you reaching for your Bible to check out the book's premise. It can knock the props out of your feeling of security in todays world. Almost impossible to read ""Left Behind"" without running out to purchase the next in the series.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"
1,Don't bother with these.,All of the books in the series are pretty poorly written and none of the characters are memorable or interesting. These books aren't worth their cost.
4,Eye Opener,"The Left Behind, series, is like putting a visual to what the Bible, tells us is going to happen,in the last days."
3,Will you be Left Behind?,"Imagine a day when all the 'good' people on earth suddenly vanish into thin air, leaving behind clothes, jewelry, and even their braces. In the novel Left Behind, by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, that is exactly what happens. The plot thickens as four humans trapped on earth join forces to find out what has happened to their vanished loved ones. This novel is the first in a series of, at the moment, 11 books that follow the story of those stranded on earth after the rapture. Left Behind was intriguing mostly because I believe that someday it will happen. The novel is almost like a glimpse into the future during the seven-year trials after the rapture. It was slow at times but even the slower parts played a role in the creation of the series. Of course, this book is based hugely on the Bible and Christianity, so it is a very religious book. But I did decide something after reading the book, I will not be Left Behind."
1,awful in all possible ways,"I got a free copy of this book, and read it through, considering it important since I'd heard they were becoming popular. It was so very vile in every way that it is possible for a book to be vile that rather than selling it, gifting it, or BookCrossing it, I put it in the paper recycling. Then I talked a bookstore owner into taking it out of his window.I have never before seen a book that was at once so very deeply stupid, stylistically horrible, esthetically unpleasant, and morally repugnant. Left Behind is bad writing, bad entertainment, and bad theology."
2,Disliking this book does not make you a bad Christian,The scenerios formulated by the authors in this book are interesting but it is unfortunate that the writing is so poor. I found myself forced to read this book out of the sheer curiosity of where it was headed.The development of the characters is very obvious and at times irritating as there is no depth to them. I tried the second book but stopped a quarter of the way as I couldn't stop myself from nodding off in boredom.Read the Bible instead. You'll get the story straight from the source with no confusing ideas to worry about.
4,ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDFING,"This is one of the most amazing books I have evr read in my entire life. It starts off quick, with no slow stuff to introduce the Rapture. It's just there. The plot is so twisting, conniving, and absolutely incredible that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end."
5,An excellent read,"I don't have a very religious background, but I found this book to be very interesting, and not ""preachy"" like I thought it might be. Very good book, and I am now reading the second book in the series. I recommend it highly!!"
5,Changed the way I look at everything,"I am not a big reader of religious fiction, I read action thrillers, Tom Clancy, John Grisham, etc. but a friend recommended Left Behind to me. I LOVED it - it doesn't read as a religious book at all, just a riviting, exciting, enjoyable story. Most highly recommended!"
1,Don't be fooled,"*NOTE: This review is for the 2008 ""(Enhanced)"" version of the film, produced and distributed exclusively by amazon.comI think amazon hunted for the WORST print of this movie in existance to distribute! The picture goes in and out of focus as the dark levels jump all over the place. The speed of the projection even shifts all around. Also there is no score to accompany the picture so it is truly and literally a silent movie. Do yourself a favor and purchase the Kino version of a few years ago. I have and it is wonderful. This is now one of my favorite movies but it never would have been so if I had tried to deal with the presentation on this item. I will be very suspicious of any movie posted with an enhanced tag as amazon appears to be trying to make a quick buck and doesn't really care what they are passing off to movie lovers."
2,Dull early experimental film,Some early films continue to shine because of their artistry. Others get devalued because technology has dated them. This is ond of the latter. I found this film collage of life in 1929 Russia to be dull. Editing which might have seemed revolutionary in 1929 now seems obvious. Pass on this one.
4,More Good Stuff From Bibb!,"Natural Light is a slight departure from other Bibb releases and contains some nice smooth jazz/blues tunes such as ""Home Lovin' Man"" and ""Tell Riley"" as well as some very good ragtime, soul, zydeco and some spiritual stuff all mixed together. The CD consists of 13 tunes with 10 originals and 3 covers, Randy Newman's ""Everytime It Rains"", Jon Randall Stewart's tired ""Circles"" and the out of place, ""Higher and Higher."" Interestingly, Bibb's original compositions are so good that they overshadow the weak cover selections rendering those covers to mere filler on the disc. Bibb's vocals are as soft and soulful as ever and the performance is excellent. The disc could have stood alone with just the original compositions."
5,pink tie,"my son loves the color pink. pink shoelases, pink ties, pink hats. really likes this. he is most happy with it"
5,GREAT TIE!,I bought this for my grandson and he loves it. Appears to be very nice quality and color is exactly what I thought it would be.
4,Bold Pink,i got this Tie for a friend and she absolutely loved it and the color popped out and she very much enjoyed the praise she got :)
3,good value,"Ordered this tie for high school students homecoming dance, the price was right and the quality was as good as ties that i have spent three times the money for. Not sure if it would hold up for day to day wear, but for a special occasion it does the trick. I would go back to this site again for another tie."
5,Great acting by Gere and Basinger.,"""No Mercy"" was the best work by Richard Gere and Kim Basinger; they both excelled. The story, drama was very intense, yet contrasted with very earthy music and great chemistry between Gere and Basinger. It moved very fast and kept you on the edge of your seat."
4,If you love Kim------,"If you love Kim and was raised in New Orleans, as I was, this is your movie. Of course, as usual, they never seem to get our (New Orleans) accent right. Lessez le bon temps roulle"", cher!"
3,A good movie,"A cop is awfully murdered in Chicago, and his friend goes to New Orleans to revenge him. The only clue he has is a girl named Michelle, with a blue parrot tattoo on her shoulder. We will agree that ""No Mercy"" is not a master piece, but it's a good B-movie. The actors did their job, Jeroen Krabbe is a true villain, and the music is excellent. So, let's go to New Orleans !"
5,One of my favorites.,Quality was excellent. Stars are handsome and beautiful. Locations are impressive. Direction is magical. Titillating. Download was easy. I'm a happy customer.
3,Scenic flic,"Film boasts some of the best New Orleans scenery. For anyone who has visited this city, it creates nostalgia immediately. One of Gere's lesser works but has plenty action. Bassinger was there for her body. Service was great."
2,No Mercy,"Did not care for this movie. The parts of Bassinger and Gere were okay, however I didn't care for the story."
3,Down in the bayou,"Richard Gere is the tough Chicago cop who goes to the Big Easy to track down the killer of his partner. This killer is a much feared hood in New Orleans named Losado. While down there Gere runs into Kim Basinger, a ""slave"" of Losado's, and he becomes determined to free her as well as kill Losado. This is all very typical thriller fare, although it can be pretty suspenseful at times--especially in the bayous and, of course, the big ending where Gere gets his man in a nail-biting shoot out and fire. But after you've seen this, ask yourself the next day how much you can remember. Note: There's a scene in the picture that's stolen directly from Hitchcock's ""The 39 Steps"": Gere and Basinger are handcuffed together as they make their escape through the swamps."
2,a rather abysmal collection of amateurish nonsense,"This collection of short stories was very disappointing. Although often mildly interesting, these stories were clearly written by writers who were clearly amateurs or at least not very successful at their craft. While reading the worst of these I actually thought I could do better ... yes, they were THAT awful.Bottom line: the publisher obviously mashed up what were an otherwise unpublishable collection of rubbish and slapped on Hitchcock's name with hopes of making a few bucks. Not recommended."
5,Wise Soul in the Business World,I like Earl Graves' message with this book. He is very straightforward in principles of success in business and he is very good about giving credit where credit is due. He gives strong advice and has the track record (and magazine) to prove it.
1,Sloppy & Rushed,"This book struck me as a rushed product that could have used some proofreading. Some text doesn't match the illustrations or the files on the accompanying CDROM. The goal of the book seems to simply demonstrate, step-by-step, a sampling of the functions of the program, without really focusing on ""why"" or ""when"" you would use any given technique."
3,Good book for beginners in 3D graphics,Great book if you are new to 3D graphics and MAX. But I am already a guru in Softimage so I found this book to be of little help.
3,Diamonds & Emeralds By Elizabeth Taylor,"I like this fragrence a little bit. It's alright smell. I could deal with it ,not bad. I will stick with the White Diamond fragrence."
1,Too Small,Not as small as some but bettas need at least a gallon tank to live a healthy life.You can easily get a 5gal for the same price if not cheaper.Plus bettas jump. >.<
2,Too small,I used this kit as a temporary home for my betta when I first bought him. I educated myself and realized it's not right to keep a fish in here. There's no room for it to swim let alone to put a heater in there wouldn't be safe. There is no lid so there's a chance the fish could jump out. Plus the amount of water changes you would need to do to keep the water clean enough for the fish to be healthy is ridiculous. I bought my kit at Petco and of course the sales person said it was a good size when really it's entirely too small. I upgraded my betta to a 5 gallon tank soon after.
2,He Knows You're Alone,"The opening sequence is pretty good. After that, you might as well turn it off. I guess the remake of Prom Night ripped off the villian. A guy with a crazy stare that can be anyone. It is possibly the worst villian in the history of horror. The movie is slow paced and has no blood whatsoever. Matter of fact, it has barely any cursing and no nudity. It could have easily passed for PG by 80 movie standards. Not really recommended viewing unless you want to see a pre Bossom Buddies Tom Hanks, and he is only in this film for maybe three minutes."
3,It's the night again...,"This one has some good, chilling scenes. In between the dialogue is so bad it's absolutely hilarious. Much fun. Classic '80s soundtrack schlock includes ""It's The Night Again"" by someone named Vinnie Cannell. This song is played shortly before a young pot smoking maiden has her head chopped off and stuck in a fishtank for our heroine to discover."
4,Brides be gone,"The movie is about a killer that likes to kill brides. One bride Amy, played by Caitlin O'Heaney, fianc√©e decides to go on vacation with his buddies, leaving her at the mercy of the psychotic killer who likes to use a big knife. She feels she is being stalked, the killer shows up in mirrors, across the street, and at the carnival. At this point she welcomes the company of her ex-boyfriend Marvin, played by Don Scardino, and her girlfriends. Through out the movie her girl friends start turning up dead one by one along with anyone else that gets in the way.This is Tom Hanks first movie.If you like the slasher movies of the 80's then you will like He Knows Your Alone, 1980. It is suspenseful and scary at times. There is the severed head in the aquarium, the scene in the bridal shop, and the chase scene towards the end."
5,Scared The Hell Out Of Me!,Well it scared the hell out of me as a kid at least.. I watched it again about ten years ago and it wasn't quite as frightening...TOM HANKS is in it as a small bit part..but yeah The Theater scene is pretty freaky!
3,Sometimes the Memory is Better than the Flick...,"When I was a kid I first saw this slasher. It was a ""Halloween"" rip-off but so were a lot of the slashers of the 80s. After watching the DVD I noticed how dated it was. It also had scenes that reminded me of better horror films. A killer is pursuing brides to be, slashing his way down the aisle. Predictable in spots, s-l-o-w direction, and a confusing script brings this film down to nothing special. Tom Hanks appears briefly in the film. He looks SO young that it really makes this film looked dated. There is some good acting in this film, and has a few chilling spots. Worth renting, and owning if you really, really, really want ALL of Tom Hanks movies."
3,"Some shivers, but mostly stock shock","One of the many slasher films that attempted to ride on the coattails of ""Halloween"", ""He Knows You're Alone"" attempts to scare us with this tale of a terrified bride. The special effects are a bit hokey, especially since they're now so dated, and the film makes use of the worst groaner tricks - dark houses (excuse me; the first thing most frightened people do is turn on the lights in the room!), missing knives on the wall, the works. A decent popcorn movie, but if you really want to get frightened, re-view ""Halloween"" or ""When a Stranger Calls"" instead."
1,"So bad, it's good.","The classic tale of a bride, a spree killer, and a would-be suitor named ""Marvin"".A movie that captures like no other the year 1980, featuring (in a small role) the post-""Bosom Buddies"" Tom Hanks, hairstyles caught in the nether world between ""feathered"" and ""permed"", jogging, 1st-Person-Halloween-style camerawork and a prominent Moog soundtrack.Loads o' fun."
1,sad but true,"I saw this movie back on cable in the 80's when it came out, infact it was Halloween. My babysitter got so freaked out while watching this movie that she grabbed a big kitchen knife to hold onto. I remember being a little freaked out to. So when I saw that it was comming to DVD I was excited. The thing I remembered the most was the fish tank scene. I had told my girlfriend about the movie and even though she doesn't like this kind of movie she watched it anyway. She wasn't scared or creeped out in any way infact we were both extremely bored with it (the only good thing about it was the fish tank scene). This movie was better in my youth simply because I didn't know any better, that and the fact that my babysitter was so freaked out. But now that I'm older I can say without a doubt this movie just sucks, just like another movie I thought was good back then ""Blue Sunshine"". This is one of those times when the memory was much better than the reality."
1,It doesn't get much worse than this.,"He Knows You're Alone (Armand Mastroianni, 1980)Mastroianni, who has since become a rather well-known director of TV movies (Virus, The Ring, First Daughter) and series episodes (the remake of ""Dark Shadows"" and the highly underrated ""Friday the 13th: The Series""), made his debut over two decades ago with an absolutely typical B-grade slasher film. This particular piece of mediocrity would have gone the similarly obscure way of such eternal classics as Final Exam and My Bloody Valentine were it not the screen debut of some guy named Tom Hanks, who's gone on to do a few more movies that got much better critical reviews than this-- and for good reason. (It was also the first big-screen role for James Rebhorn, who has since become one of Hollywood's most-seen and lest-known character actors.) You may feel tempted to watch it just to see Tom Hanks. After you do, don't say I didn't warn you. *"
1,"""They don't know we're bored""","Oh man this is really one of the worst of the 80's ""slasher"" movies. Tom Hanks shows up for a minute, but the last almost 90. SKIP IT"
3,A typical 80s slasher flick,"I see this movie time and time again on cable and have always remember the movie theater scene and the fish bowl scene, but much to my surprise, the last time I watched it, Tom Hanks?? Very funny. Even more familiar faces are in it, like the detention teacher in the Breakfast Club. Even old-school Days of Our Lives fans should recognize one character, who bites it pretty quickly. I did like this movie because the scenes above are very creative. This is definitely one to rent for a night of cheezy 80s slasher movie. If you like these kind of movies, even if you don't admit, you like this one."
4,A REASON FOR WEDDING JITTERS .,"A serial killer is preying on young -bride -to Be's . Caitlin O. Heaney ( Amy Jenson) is the main character who senses she's being stalked . This movie was many of the many 80,s slasher flicks that featured movie legend Tom Hanks in his first role. I feel this movie had it's moments especially with the aquarium scene that would make you be afraid to be alone in your house or at least a little more aware of your surroundings when your alone . You kind of get the feeling that there was a little bit of "" Halloween influences"" throughout and overall, was a pretty effective slasher at the time ."
5,Mount Everest of Books,"The Gathering Storm is an incredible book. I never thought I'd finish it, but I did--although I'm significantly older now.The book is a masterpiece: The historical vignettes are priceless. The writing is captivating. Highly recommended!"
5,A legacy from Winston Churchill,"I am glad this book came into my hands. The narrative of the events that led to World War II, from Winston Churchill, who had the writing experience and lived, like probably nobody else close to the decisions and understanding on the reasons that lead to the war. As a good historian, Churchill realized the importance to relate these events with the expectation future generations could learn from them. As he mentioned this war was ""the war that could be easily prevented"", but good people with good intentions made a series of decisions that created the conditions for the raise of totalitarian regimes, and ignored warnings. Far from a war movie it shows the thought processes and reasoning of some of the main players in this war, examples of courage, and also the incredible human capacity for denial in front of the facts."
4,Excellent-Quick & Simple,"Excellent game. It only takes a few minutes to learn, and you can play it in about 10 minutes once everyone knows the rules. It's a good game for teaching multiplication to kids, especially if you can convince them to be the banker. The only drawback that we found was that we often run out of money cards. We usually just substitute a stock card that has already been sold for the amount of $ that we're short. Not a big problem, but a few more money cards would have solved this."
4,Modern Manners: An Etiquette Book for Rude People,"Modern Manners: An Etiquette Book for Rude People written by P.J. O'Rourke is a humorus book. A book the will get you laughing and you will not spot till the end.This is some of O'Rourke's early musings, but neverthless, it is a very funny, tongue-in-cheek way to spoof manners. As with most if not all of O'Rourke's writings you read it for the levity, flippancy, and jocularity, well you will NOT be disappointed.Read this book if you want to get away from the serious side of life. As the frivolity takes hold, you'll find that you are more relazed after a really good chuckle."
3,Don't know -- I bought it as a gift.,"Well, really, 20 more words. This survey is becoming cumbersome and annoying. Sorry. Sorry. Well, five more words and that's it."
4,Pretty Funny Satire,"This book is a good satire of our society and its mores. Written nearly 30 years ago, it still applies to American culture today. Unlike most of his political works where he blends semi-funny jokes with right-wing ideology, in this book P.J. O'Rourke generally leaves politics alone to focus on ridiculing every aspect of modern American culture: from the drugs we take, to our sexual morals, to the insipid youth culture, and on and on. His main point, from what I can tell, is that in modern America, we've all become self-absorbed bastards. He may be on to something."
2,Not his best,"I am a big PJ fan but this was disappointing with a serious lack of content. Start with his best works, Holidays in Hell and Parliament of Whores; then if you really want more work you're way down to this."
2,funny for people with an iq of 90.,i thought id enjoy a book from o rourke. i find his interviews rather cool. it turns out the humor got predictable and boring real fast. it reads like a dorky teen humor magazine
1,Farenheit 451,"I've never thought of myself as a book-burner, but after reading the beginning of this book i'm prepared to make an exception in this case. This is the most facile piece of intellectually insulting drivel I have ever read.Armed with a topic which offers a wealth of material for a skilled satirical writer, PJO totally missed the boat on this one.There is only one reason anyone should buy this book: as a self awareness test. If you enjoy this work you should get the message that you should give up reading entirely and concentrate on more intellectually enriching pursuits, like reality TV.To save someone else from having to experience this text, I am going to burn my copy; or perhaps grind it up for compost."
2,Disappointing - There are much better lists than this...,"The book lists are somewhat helpful, but heavy on popular books - too much twaddle (dumbed down literature) for my taste. She completely omits some of the greatest authors of children's Christian literature; there are no listings for the works of: R.M. Ballantyne, G.A. Henty, Martha Finley, Ralph Moody, Caroline Dale Snedeker, or Opal Wheeler. Also, GH spends several pages defending the Harry Potter series. I much prefer the lists by Nathaniel Bluedorn, Christine Miller, Jan Bloom, and The Noah Plan."
5,Perfect Shower Gift,"I wish that I had found this book when my children were young. This is a must have if you are trying to find good books for your children. The description of the books has helped me to choose books that are geared toward the different interest of my children.While there are well known books listed there are also many unknown books listed which has been valuable to me.Also, the guidance, wisdom, and information that precedes the book lists is rich.This will be my #1 shower gift from now on. I have purchased this book for my daughter, and also her book ""Honey For A Woman's Heart"".Enjoy :)"
5,Safe Resource,"I can't keep up with my 11 year old's reading. I know that I can let her read anything in this book (that is within her age range) and feel safe about it. Great Resource for any parent who wants their child only reading good and appropriate books. There is a lot of garbage out there for kids to read, and this is just one way to avoid that without reading every single book before your child does."
5,Wonderful Gift!,"This is a wonderful book. I received it as a baby shower gift and now I give it as a gift at every baby shower I attend. The premise of the book is that we should not only provide for our children's basic needs but also provide them with the ""honey"" or sweet things of life. The author sees great works of literature as a wonderful source of honey for our children. The book lists are wonderful sources of great authors and illustrators for books geared toward babies, and all the way up through pre-teen books. Using the book lists in Honey for a Child's Heart has helped me slow down life, turn off the kids' movies, and savor life with my children."
4,VERY USEFUL,"I found this book to be very useful. It explains the real purpose of books in our lives. She's off on the Harry Potter stuff, but the rest of the book is quite helpful."
2,I love the 3rd Edition,I purchased the 3rd Edition but received 2 other editions. I kept the 2 that I did not want but I wasn't happy that the bookstores sent the wrong edition.
2,Not Enough Honey for Me,"Not like the real McCoy. I was replacing my original edition that I had loaned to a friend. I agree with another reviewer, Harry Potter has no place in this book. I also don't appreciate all the newer books focusing on racial inequality and sensitivities. Children need good, solid, CLASSICAL literature, especially hard to find in the public libraries these days."
4,Flower toe ring,I like this toe ring when wearing flip flops.I use Arm and Hammer baking soda with water to clean it and the sterling silver stays shiny. I like the fact that this toe ring is adjustable so it fits on any of the four toes except the big toe thumb.It is a comfortable to ring and doesn't scrap the skin between my toes.
4,great band.,"this is the sophomore album by these guys. not quite as good as tortured existence, but not bad. skull fracturing nightmare,carnivorous obsession, and the title track are the highlights. if you like thrash, speed metal you'll like these dudes."
5,A brutal fusion of violence and perfection,"In a world where good music is far and few in between, THIS album destroys, crushes, and humbles anyother poser band that thinks they are ""badass"". Friends, we have ourselves a masterpiece just based on the brutality of this album. The lyrics are brutal. In fact brutal isn't even a good enough word to desrcibe the lyrics. The lead singer swallowed nails for breakfast. The bass guitar adds more brutality to the drums. The guitars are blazing with heavy riffs and face melting solos. Vinny Daze, the man on the drums is one of the most brutal drummers I've ever heard. But beware, this album takes on The Big Four, all of the German bands, and most of the death metal bands out during this time, it takes on all the poser metal bands out today, and defeats all of them. Epidemic of Violence is a dose of metal we all need to hear."
5,A refreshing walk through God's wondrous creation!,"This pictoral delight lets readers sample a variety of scenes captured on film by Kalitka himself. Some sites include: The Garden of the Gods; Estes Park, CO, and photos from the Dalsnibbe Mountains of Norway; Stockholm,Sweden; and Prince Edward Island, Canada. The Big Picture is functional on many levels; Kalitka has paired inspirational thoughts and Bible passages with his photography. This makes for a moving sequence featuring the Iwo Jima Memorial and Arlington National Cemetery paired with a passage from Ecclesiastes ""To everything there is a season..."" The author tempers levity with comedy; throwing such items as a grinning light-and-tinsel snowman found in Marshall, TX for good measure. The Big Picture left me with a feeling of serenity, peace and gratitude, and the desire to share with a friend."
3,Not SACD,"I have discovered a manufacturing glitch. Second disc, wich is meant to be a DSD recording of the 9th Symphon is a CD, not a SACD.Be aware!! It's a very good version of the 9th, but is not a SACD!!!!"
1,I was so disappointed.,"I share the sentiments of my fellow reviewers - this was contrived, shallow and a total let-down. It was as if Mr. Hillerman hired out the writing. I am a total fan, and eagerly awaited the book. Now I will eagerly await the next one. I am always an optimist."
2,"""The Sinister Pig"" lacks heart and depth.","I have enjoyed most of Hillerman's novels for many years but ""The Sinister Pig"" I found to be a shallow novel written without heart or depth. It almost seems the author let his computer write the book. Possibly he is tired of these characters and needs a new format. I read the entire book hoping the author's wonderful writing style would be found, but alas it was not to be."
2,Not Up to His Standards,"As a long time Hillerman fan, this book was not up to his standards. Most of the story dealt with Washington politics and corporate crime. There was little suspence, as the conclusion was obvious almost from the start. I hope Hillerman goes back to his stories of life in the southwest and Navajo culture."
3,Quick read; missing mysticism,"A quick read but I guess I continue to expect Mr. Hillerman to add depth to his novels as he did in his earlier works. The ""Sinister Pig"" continues with the ""Wailing Wind"" in that it just seems flat. Exchanging Navajo mysticism for Jim Chee's continuous whining about his lost loves doesn't add to his character or to the story (the whining is getting old, maybe now its at an end).This book will go on my shelf with all the other Hillerman novels but I doubt it will be re-read as others are. As a previous reviewer asked - is Mr. Hillerman tired & running out of steam?"
3,Decorative Indians,"It's a little ironic that Hillerman made his reputation as a chronicler of Din√© (Navajo) characters and culture, but tends to put other tribes in his novels as local color elements. I was interested to see Tohono O'odham characters in Sinister Pig, but disappointed when it became obvious that Hillerman knows little or nothing about the O'odham. They're not ""locals"" in the SE Arizona / New Mexico bootheel region any more than Navajo or Hopi are. He has Jim Chee think, ""That tribe had its reservation on the Mexican border, lapping over into Arizona"". Jeesh! Look at a map, Tony: the Tohono O'odham reservation, about the size of Connecticut, is right smack in Arizona southwest of Tucson. (Lots of O'odham live in Sonora, but not on designated reservation land.)Minor point? Yes, in terms of the novel overall. No, in terms of Hillerman's reputation as an amabassador of Native culture to a broader readership."
2,Hillerman is on auto pilot,"I love Tony Hillerman. I have read every book he has written including all his Chee/Leaphorn books, his children's book, his coffee table book, his memoir, his non-fiction books, etc. I even liked ""Finding Moon"". Having said this, his last several Chee/Leaphorn books are delivering a diminishing return of enjoyment. ""The Sinister Pig"" is an acceptable novel but without question the worst Chee/Leaphorn book to date. The books feel particularly strained in how Hillerman tries to bring all of the series characters (Chee, Leaphorn and Bernie) together in unlikely and implausible ways despite their natural separation by age, jobs and hundreds of miles. What I most enjoy about Hillerman are his steady pacing, sense of the environment and interweaving of Navajo and western culture. All of this is present in this novel. What is missing is carefully plotting and crisp dialogue."
1,"Is Hillerman getting lazy, tired or sick?","I've read all of Hillerman's books, and this one is a major disappointment. It reads like a very rough first draft, a plot sketch. If you pay attention to the bewildering number of characters, the plot plods resolutely forward, no surprises -- and none of the intricate twists that Hillerman has dazzled us with in previous books. The characters are thinly developed (so-o-o-o little tension between major love interests) and seldom manage to rise above pot-boiler level. Unlike his other books that take place on the reservation, there is no interesting information about native Americans, their history, culture, etc. About the only thing this book CAN claim to do is keep you turning the pages. You keep believing that surely the real Tony Hillerman will appear to delight you. Alas, he's asleep at the wheel. It's a shame to see such a talent settle for so little.I am one disappointed fan."
2,Quite disappointed!,"I am a big fan of all mystery and crime novels, so naturally I went out to get this book. I was sadly disappointed, and almost regret my purchase. There wasn't the usual umph I feel from his novels. I do have one spark of good that came out of this. I took the chance on a new author, I bought her book and loved it. It was ""Waves of Deceit"" by Marlene de Velasco. I would read that one again over this anyday."
1,His worst in the series.,"An interesting plot but all of Hillerman's strengths, careful delineation of place and characters is absent. Any characters from any author could fill the roles. Is someone writing for Hillerman now? I won't pay money for any further novels by this author until his writing improves.A shame because his early novels are among my favorites."
3,"Not his best, but still better than most","Tony Hillerman falls off his stride when he attempt to plot a story around high-falutin' eastern types. But how can any story that features Joe Leaphorn and his magical maps--even if only tangentially--fail to enchant a listener? The final compilation is not Hillerman's best, but it is still a whole lot better than a whole lot else out there. The audio version is wonderfully read by Geroge Guidall."
3,Calling attention to a problem,"The acknowledgements at the beginning of this book tell the reader why this book was written. Mr. Hillerman mentions ""the Department of the Interior's efforts to explain what has happened to $176,000,000 (billions!!!) of Indian oil, gas, coal, timber, etc-royalties which it can't seem to account for.""In reading this book, it seemed as if Mr. Hillerman's outrage over this little publicized situation and his effort to call attention to it, led him to give less attention to his usual complexity of character and setting.This book was perfect for airplane reading and may lead me to learn more about the missing royalities. It may also lead me to read ""Seldom Disappointed"" to learn more about Tony Hillerman and what makes him tick."
1,The Sinister Pig,Juvenile dialog. In one scene a line is attributed to a character not even in the scene. Found that my daughter can write a better and more descriptive story that what I paid $... for. Would not recommend.
4,Another great Hillerman novel,"Thank goodness I didn't rely on other reviews saying that Mr. Hillerman's new book was a disappointment. I thought it was really exciting and developed the character of Jim Chee much further. I am one of the lucky ones who calls New Mexico home. I nod in agreement at the descriptions of the beautiful landscapes...I get to see them every day. If you have come to know Leaphorn and Chee through earlier books, don't miss this one!"
3,Disappointed,"I regretfully must agree with those who were disappointed in The Sinister Pig. Yes, it put some light on a subject that needs to be addessed (""missing"" funds"")....but, it was not up to the usual Hillerman standard. Has he run out of ideas for Chee and Leaphorn? I probably will not read this book a second time...something I've done with all of his previous works. It lacked the heart, soul and depth of prior novels....as if he were tired of the Chee/Leaphorn/Navajo country plot. Please, Mr. Hillerman, go back to the winning formula of your previous books....so good that your policemen appear ""real"" to the reader."
3,"OK, but not up to his previous titles.",This is really a light weight mystery romance. It continues the story line of Hillerman's charactors which fans will want to read but really stretches to come up with a plausible plot. It doesn't have the depth you usually find in his books.
2,Hillerman's mailing it in,"Disappointing. Hillerman tries to include the whole gang -- not just Joe, Jim and Bernie, but Cowboy Dashee and Professor Bourbonette -- as well as stock baddies from Washington, a psychopathic hit man and allusions to the oil/gas royalty scandal. But he loses interest in too many of his red herrings, and the story limps along. Still, Hillerman fans will buy it, and read it. But for the third time running (""Wailing Wind,"" ""Hunting Badger"") he's really not making the effort. He should have stopped with ""Fallen Man,"" one of his best."
3,"OK, but far from Hillerman's best","I love this series, but this entry is not Hillerman's best stuff. I'm not sure if he's running out of steam, or if the life stories of Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee don't allow much development at this point. The dense subplotting and evocative details about Navajo life, so evident in the best Leaphorn/Chee stories, are mostly missing here. Hillerman seems to have been motivated mainly by a desire to wrap up the Jim Chee/Bernie Manuelito relationship, which he does, but not in a particularly original way. If you are new to this series, try the books written in the 1980's to get a better sense of Hillerman's considerable talent; The Dark Wind is probably the best of the best."
1,A Fall from Grace,"I have read most of Mr. Hillerman's Chee/Leaphorn books and enjoyed all of them, even the early ones that lacked the depth of his later works, but this book left me cold. Every character of worth Hillerman created had to have spot in this book, and many didn't fit well. This was too contrived to hold interest."
2,Should stick to writing about the Southwest,"This is not his best work. Hillerman writes beautifully about the Southwest, but knows nothing at all about Washington, DC. The parts of this book that deal with New Mexico are up to his usual high standards - although as another reviewer points out, one character's transfer into the Border Patrol is less than realistic.However, Hillerman's Washington section and characters are straight out of a comic book. Part of the charm of his other novels has been the realism of the setting and the complexity of his characters. The DC-related people would be comfortable in any number of shallow thrillers. They sharply lower the quality of this book.Hillerman should stick to writing about areas he knows. This could have been a fascinating book dealing with the looting of Native American trust accounts if he had limited his scope."
5,The Sinister Pig,Hillerman is at his best again. This will keep you turning pages until you reach the last page. Hillerman's style is evident and welcomed.
1,What in the world has happened to Tony Hillerman?,"The wonderfulness of Hillerman's Chee/Leaphorn stories has been the richness of their Navaho/Four Corners detail, the sensitivity of his characterizations, and the subtlety of the mysteries he unfolds. Now, suddenly, we have kindergarten plotting, cartoon characters, and, unbelievably, clunky, almost amateurish writing. Even the best of them produce a turkey one in a while, and I guess this is Hillerman's. Let's hope he's back on form next time."
1,is hillerman losing it ?,i wouldn't bother with this one. it is a crashing bore. hillerman has been on a slide the past few years. he has reached bottom.
1,Who actually wrote The Sinister Pin?!,"I have been a faithful and avid follower of Mr. Hellerman's books not so much for the mystery as for the interest in lore and traditions, beliefs, syntax of the the various indian tribes of the American Southwest. An opportunity to actually be invited into the indian everyday world nicely intertwined with the fluff of the mystery. Anticipating each new story, the only mystery to me here is...who wrote this pale facsimile...surely not Mr. Hellerman. Or if he is infact the creator, he missed badly on this one. I felt a similar shadow of doubt with Skelton Man and can only hope Mr. Hellerman's next offering will be back on track! A Hillerman mystery without the indian stuff"" generously mixed in,is well, just a pulp mystery."
2,The Thin Pig,"I think the author needed to flesh out his bank account, and so Hillerman fans will be disappointed at this novelette. All the depth of knowledge and depth of plot one cherishes in the other Chee/Leaphorn adventures is missing.A quick pleasant read, with a predictable plot, but don't expect more than that. The reader does learn a tad about Chee's vapid relationship to women, but even that is thinly treated, and it plays out foreseeably. This is not a Hillerman novel I will re-read. Glad I found it at the library, it will not be put on my own shelves."
2,Just not up to Mr. Hillerman's par.,"I was disappointed with this latest of Mr. Hillerman's books. I have read all of his books, fact and fiction. But this is too far roaming and so far from his normal stories.I am sure that he will return to his excellent way of portraying Chee and the others in murders around Shiprock. At least I hope so. I have always been a fan and will stick with him."
3,Leaphorn and Chee offstage too much,"I eagerly await each new Hillerman book spotlighting the compelling duo of Native American lawmen Leaphorn and Chee. The author has defined these two in a low-key, nicely detailed manner that makes them compelling and comfortable, story after story. Why, oh why does Hillerman keep his appealing heroes offstage for so long in this latest outing? He continually cuts away from the good guys to focus on the bad guys, who are uninteresting and mundane.I've devoured every Leaphorn/Chee mystery, and am sad to report that this is by far the weakest. But onward and upward, Mr. Hillerman. Bring on some more."
3,More like a screen play?,"I live in ABQ and travel NM a lot. I missed the sincere familiarization of geography with ""PIG"". Each succesive book I read by Mr. Hillerman reminds me more of a TV screen play and less like a novel along the lines of Clancy. There is so much room for more details in the Hillerman books. Two of his novels are currently being filmed here in NM for a PBS showing in November, lending credence to my thoughts.Tony- please give us a great novel to remember you by, not a screen play. I'll anxiously await the next Hillerman mystery."
1,hillerman's worse,The plot in this was so far fetched and unrealistic as to be appalling. No where near his usual standards. To understand the characters you have to have read other books in the seris. This is not a stand alone book. Mr. Hillerman must have needed the money to write and publish a novel so inept.
4,Triangulating Three Mysteries,"Sergeant Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police and his retired partner Joe Leaphorn investigate related cases involving people and drug smuggling across the US-Mexico border and Indian oil-gas production fraud.Their relationship with the Federal authorities again focus on the arrogance and incompetence of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the FBI. Their colleague Bernie Manuelito, formerly with the Navajo Tribal Police and now with the Border Patrol, is instrumental in discovering the tie between the dope smuggling and people smuggling, with exploitation of Mexicans being smuggled into the US.The Navajo officers, with help from an Apache colleague put the pieces together to find the link between the fraud and border cases and the murder on tribal land that pointed to both."
2,Don't Start with This One!,"I really love Hillerman's books. He is one of my favorite authors. That said, everyone lets a stinker once in a while, and this is Hillermans. My first impression was that Hillerman had gotten so old and feeble that he couldn't write any more. This impression was later corrected, he's as good as ever. So, if you like Hillerman, don't expect much from this one. If you have not read Hillerman, don't start here - please. He is a very good author and all of this other books are far superior to this one."
2,Nothing special,"The best I can say is the audio book kept me awake on a long drive. The book barely resembles the early Hillerman ones I remember, and is sort of a mix of generic Crichton-Grisham political/crime suspense with a little romance and a little New Mexico flavor thrown in for old-times sake."
2,A sad falling off,"Reading Tony Hillerman's latest, I was at first thrilled by the congregation of old friends - Jim, Joe, Bernie, Cowboy et al - and a return to the delightfully atmospheric Four Corners. Then not too many pages further, my elation was undermined by a pathetically weak plot, a non-dimensional villan and female victim, and a rush to the totally predictable and maudlin denouemont. Let's hope that Tony finds a second wind; these characters and northern New Mexico are too good to waste on a comic book story."
4,"Worthwhile, Quick Read","This book was a worthwhile and quick read. The author did a better job than other authors in relating the value approach to the theory of the firm, probability analysis, and behavioral finance -- and he did it in a non-technical way. I would agree with others that some of the chapters on specific money managers dd not provide much insight into their individual approaches."
2,Good Try,"Not a bad stab at the basics, but the debt owed to others is immense. One third of the book consists of excerpts from Warren Buffett's Essays, disorganized, and better read in the collection THE ESSAYS OF WARREN BUFFETT: LESSONS FOR CORPORATE AMERICA (a full compilation by topic, well organized and rave reviewed). The hats off to some other top investors too, whose profiles are shallow and would be better to read them directly too. The rest is a skeleton outline, better delivered in several other books on the masters like Buffett and teacher Ben Graham (neither of whom, incidentally, even believe there is such a thing as the title of this book suggests there is--value investing is a redundancy they say, though the authors of this book don't grasp that basic point)."
2,Turkey and Where is the Beef?,There is simply not enough value in this book to justify using it. I'm sorry but words like Alta Vista and Cisco just should not appear anywhere in a value investing book. Period and discussion over. At least not up to the present. Maybe in the future but I doubt it. Also there is way too much verbage to describe much of nothing. The modern budding value investor would be better served by other book including Security Analysis by Graham. A lot of detail is missing here and much of the analysis leaves one wondering if the authors know what value investing really is.
5,Great Little Jack,I needed a short stubby bottle jack to fit under a car with little clearance and this Stinger Short Jack worked just perfect. It's plenty heavy duty enough in a nice stubbly little package. Feels solid and well built. Great price and service from the vendor too was a real plus.
3,Ho Hum,"Slow, kinda boring riffs. There are some catchy songs, here and there, but I would not recommend picking this up.Most people rave about this Grave album and say its their best, but to me, it sounds like Grave on valium. There really is no comparing this album to their debut. This is Grave following the death n roll trend, which is unfortunately, a turn for the worse. With all due respect, this is the last Grave album thats worth hearing.What happened to the raw, savage songs that blessed Into The Grave (obviously their best album) and You'll Never See ??? Instead of buying this album, go pick up INTO THE GRAVE."
3,Andrew melick's men,"Warning: Don't Judge A Book By Its Cover - you may be disappointed with the results. While most of the photographs show healthy, strapping young men, many of the poses look as though his inspiration came from one of his contemporaries, namely Underhill... its unfortunate seeing that this is the same dude who does the photoshoots for GYM and BURN magazine... let the buyer beware!"
2,totally derivative,"The guys are good-looking in a generic sort of way, and the photography is perfectly adequate (which, as Dwight MacDonald once pointed out, usually means inadequate), but there's not a smidgen of originality in the whole production. It's all taken right out of Mapplethorpe, Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. In fact, a couple of the shots are such obvious copies of Weber's work that Weber ought to be suing this guy (if he cared to stoop). Even if you aren't bothered by lack of originality and are just looking for a bit of a turn-on, you won't find much in that department either. Comes complete with a pretentious and near-illiterate commentary at the end (""the answer still alludes us""). Indeed."
4,Eccentric but useful!,"The author is obviously somewhat eccentric but the info included in this book is useful and effective. While Bronson does ramble a bit he does have some things to say that make a lot of sense. The program recommendation is essentially a combination of bodyweight exercises and isometrics. Overall basic exercises but most will get you results as long as you put forth the effort. I would guess that the reviewer that didn't get results either didn't put forth the effort, or didn't follow the instructions.Is this the best book out there on bodyweight exercise? Not even close. However, for the cost of $10 and a little effort, the program could do wonders for many."
4,"This guy is crazy, but his training method is great","Why would any one read this fitness book? Yes it's writen by a crazy dude locked up in prison, the pictures are poorly quality, most of the exercises are basic ones, and the training routines don't have much variety.However this isn't just an exercise book, it's more like a true fitness book. There's sections on sexual health, internal cleansing, mind over matter, and having the right attitude in life. The author gives you the same tools and tips that have allowed him to stay strong and fit regardless of his situation. If he is able to stay healthy, break athletic records, and get stronger all while being lockup in solitary confinement, there's no reason we can't do the same."
2,poor,I wondered why this book was called the yoga dog till the last few pages. I thought that I would perhaps pay $5 for the quality and content of this book. $20. is an outrage. A child could have written it. A dog should not be eating pizza. Dogs don't digest tomatoe. Children reading this would think it is ok to give a dog pizza.
5,kids love it!,"All the kids I have shown this book to really love it! The story about Babu is very cute, and the introduction to a yoga poses is great for first timers.I would highly recommend it to anyone with kids."
4,Great Characters..Great Story...Recommended Read,"This is a story about a couple who desire one another so much that they absolutley cannot restrain it...despite any consequences. The heroine was different in this one and I liked her. So often heroines are made to appear so strong and independent, but then they become so missish with the hero, and it tends to counter what the author had previously told us. Not so in this story. This is an easy, light read with enjoyable characters. LaFoy pens two more in this series about the heroine's (Caroline) sisters, Simone and Fiona. I actually read those before I read this one, and although it's been a while, I remember enjoying those as well. I plan to go back and reread them now that I've read this one, and look forward to it. This is a worthy, enjoyable read. The ending is a little abrupt, and maybe a little cheesy, but I still enjoyed it altogether."
3,Theory and Practice of Goldsmithing - for the advanced Jeweller!,"Extremely technical and only for those initiated. No, pretty pictures or design ideas, just hard facts in physics and chemistry of metalwork. Recommended reading for advanced crafters who want to know why, rather than how. Originally written in German, there are some slight difference in terminology used by English speaking jewellers."
1,Wished I had heeded the warnings,This DVD sucks and IS useless as noted by another. I am a quick learner and I have gotten nothing but frustrated with this annoying DVD and the Instructors. Don't waste your money. I usually don't rate things I but hoped I would keep someone else from wasting their money.
1,Useless,"Since I've been invited to a party where line dancing is going to be featured, I thought that this would be a perfect video to learn some of the moves. Wrong! First of all, they go over each move way too quickly for a newcomer to catch on. Plus, they demonstrate the moves facing the camera so the viewer doesn't know whether to to begin on the left or right foot.Also, the man and woman who demonstrate the moves are rarely in sync. Half the time, the woman begins and the man has to catch up. This is really an awful, disappointing DVD."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Ok, I bought this video thinking that it would help me learn some of the line dance moves. I watched the whole dvd through to begin with and realized that this is a poor instructional dvd! There is little step by step instruction and it moves way too fast. You either have to be an intermediate or advanced level dancer to keep up with this video or rewind & slow-mo the dvd ten million times to learn anything! If you are a beginner, then don't get this. I should've paid attention to the reviewers before me that had bought this dvd but I just saw the low price so I bought and evidently wasted my money and time..."
2,Not What I Expected,This product was not what I thought it would be. It did not have enough instruction. It just showed the dances slower rather than break them down.
1,Terrible,"I lasted about 20 minutes into this DVD before I stopped it, took it out, and gently put it away for safe keeping. I had no idea what was going on as it was all over the place. The dancers looked good on the screen but I couldn't follow the directions at all. I just stood there like an idiot with my hands in the air talking to my TV in the hopes they'd help me better understand. I finally just gave up."
1,A waste of money,"Thankfully I didn't waste the money. I borrowed it from my library. I do this and then purchase the ones I like from stores. This was the worst 'teaching' video my husband and I have seen. They run through the steps so fast. The couple faces the camera so you can't follow them. It would be much easier to learn somewhere people are dancing it and follow those around.If they teach classes like this, they can't have much success."
5,great way to learn,went to a line dancing class and oh my too fast so this video is just right for me a first timer. Really good instuction and great moves. I like it a lot.
1,Take a class!,This video was so confusing and was nothing more than an opportunity for the performers to show their skills. I just wanted basis steps for basic line dances taught in a simple step by step manner. Buy a different DVD or take a class!
5,Buxton Leather Clutch Pink,"Buxton leather products beat out all the trendy wallets (Fossil, GAP, etc) as for style, function and durability. The outercover is all leather, interior is fabric liner with leather exposed. Fast shipping. Exactly as described. A++"
2,Just cheap quality,I like the style of this wallet but the material that it's made of feels very cheap. So far I haven't even changed it out with my old worn out broken wallet.
2,Well designed but cheap material,"I was looking for a leather wallet with a lot of storage. This one does have plenty of storage and I like the idea of it but the inside fabric is child's play toy, dollar store cheap plastic. If they could make this wallet with good quality leather inside and out it would be perfect."
2,Buxton Leather Zip-around Checkbook Clutch PINK (WRONG),"I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I PAID FOR THE PINK ONE, BUT THE SELLER SEND ME ANOTHER, DIFFERENTE, MODEL, COLOR, STYLE AND I DON'T KNOW IF THE PRICE IS OTHER."
2,Very disappointed!,"There's a apparent breakage found when I open the plastic pack (no box), and only cover leathern!Will not buy this brand, absolutely."
4,Needed one more view.,"To have had a shot looking down into zipper compartment would have been nice. There is so much more room for credit cards, cash, coupons etc. that isn't described or shown.Like anyone with a new wallet I am still having difficulty finding where I put things.Buxton Heiress Ensemble Clutch"
1,Not as pictured - Beware!,"I ordered this for my mom to replace her current one that she loves, which is what's in the pictures, but when I got the new one it's a different design and doesn't have the horizontal credit card slots (my mom's favorite part!). Very disappointed."
4,Almost too many compartments,"It is taking a bit of time to get used to this wallet. There are almost too many places to put things. However, it is very nice. The leather is ""buttery"" and I am growing to love it."
4,Now That's A Nice-Lookin' Alien!,"Here's a ditsy but humorous and generally likable movie that sports the best-looking alien I've ever seen: Kim Bassinger.Basinger hardly ever looked better, which is saying a lot. At the time, it was unusual to see her in a comedy after viewing her in tough crime or sex-type movies for awhile. (I didn't see this film until 10 years after it had been released.) She's a decent comedienne, like her ex-husband (Alec Baldwin) has turned out to be, too.The comedy is more chuckles than guffaws. For parents wondering about the film: there is the usual too-liberal ""values"" espoused here, such as sex on the first date is ""cool,"" and a few other things involving a cute teen daughter. The profanity isn't too much, except by Jon Lovitz, who provides much of it. In all, a dumb story but a nice, feel-good ending helps."
3,Alyson Hannigan is adorable!,"I got this movie thinking it would be really stupid, but I wanted to see a young Alyson Hannigan. She did a phenominal job with the part, and the rest of the movie was really good too."
5,none,even if the story line seems kind of chessey it is a good movie to and i think kim basinger and dan ackrode are both good in this moviem
3,It's okay!,I saw this movie on HBO along time ago and I kinda liked it. It is a little cheesy but the main reason why I like it is because Seth Green and Alyson Hannigan are in it. They are funny actors because they were both in American Pie. If you hadn't seen this movie you will probably like it.
5,Fantastic Movie!!,I first bought the DVD for my mother for Christmas. She let me borrow it. I am glad that I finally watched it. It is a truly great movie. It is a funny movie and very entertaining. I suggest either renting it or buying it.
3,Cute movie with great Dan Aykroyd lines and Jon Brant's band Siren on Soundtrack!,"Siren, which later had to change theirname to Red Siren (after Jon had left)had it's 'retracted' second single""One good lover"" from it's debut LPon this hip movie's soundtrack. KimBassinger is atractive in parringwith Aykroyd, in his best movie since'The Great Outdoors' with late Canuck-mate John Candy."
5,Experiencing the Shift,"For anyone seriously interested in realizing what the ""new age"" is all about, I would say--read this book. The author not only talks about the shift that is ""coming soon,"" she gives you an experience of it here and now. Her style of writing is unique, to say the least, and is not easy reading, but I found by not trying to understand the words intellectually, I was able to allow the words to penetrate to a deeper level. At that point something in the brain shifted and a whole new multidimensional reading experience opened up. It's kind of like those 3-D pictures that are totally impenetrable in 2-D, but if you relax the focus in a particular way, a whole new three-dimensional experience opens up. I would suggest reading the introduction first. It gives a good perspective on how to read the book."
2,Not very bright,This globe is not very bright or sturdy and I don't think it is worth the money. I would say this is worth $15-$20.
4,A Wonderful family film for all.,"When a Puppy found by the Newton Family (Charles Grodin, Bonnie Hunt, Nicholle Tom, Christopher Gastille and Sarah Rose Karr), they adopt the Puppy to become and grows up to be a 185 Pound Saint Bernard, which a Scientist Business Man (Dean Jones) and his two workers (Oliver Platt and Stanley Tucci) kidapped animals for a Science Division on the Breakthough of a Animal Skull, who wants Beethoven is thier Division.Directed by Brian Levant (The Flintstones, Jingle all the Way, Snow Dogs) made a entertaining comedy for the whole family. Watch for Actors:Melora Walters (Boogie Nights, Magnolia), The X-Files:David Duchovny and Everybody Loves Raymond`s Patricia Heaton. Exective Produced by Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters). A Box Office Hit in the Spring of 1992. A winner. Grade:B+."
3,Beethoven,"I figured I would enjoy this more than I did, I guess it's a bit too young for me. It's funny sometimes, but most things are kiddy jokes I guess. Basically it's just another dog movie"
4,Nice Doggie,"Beethoven DVDBeethoven is a comedy about a family with a Saint Bernard dog and all the trouble the dog gets in to. A laugh-a-minute.Highly recommended for the entire family, especially dog lovers.Gunner April, 2008"
4,I Love It,"I used to watch ""Beethoven"" when I was was young, and I was watching it today. We have this and ""Beethoven's 2nd"" on video, but I agree that ""Beethoven"" may not be for younger children but I really, really love it."
3,Good but pretty kiddish,"The second half is so much better than the first half. The first half is pretty boring and far too kiddish. The actors are pretty bad, especially the kids. But I do like the comical part of it."
3,I'ts Beethoven the movie,This is kinda a funny movie but its really not all that great. If you like to party out on Friday nite its a good Saturday hangover movie with the crew.
4,beethoven,sorry that it took so long to review this my computer has been down for awhile. my daughter really likes this
5,I Love This Movie!!!!!!,This is a Grrrreat movie!!I love the part when the crazy babysitter is singing and Beethoven saves the little girl from drowning in the pool! You will fall on the floor laughing!
4,Roll over Beethoven!!!,I got this movie for Christmas back when I was 7 and fell in love with this movie. Now I am 14 and I stil love this movie. It is about this St. Bernard named Beethoven who finds a home. The kids and mother like Beethoven but the father doesn't. It also involves an evil veterinarian that kidnaps dogs and then does illegal experimentations on them. It may be a little dark for younger kids but it is heartwarming and funny. I think Charles Grodin and Bonnie Hunt did an excellent job with their roles as parents of 3 children. I wish I had a St. Bernard like Beethoven even though he drools and makes a mess in the house. I would recommend this movie to anybody. see it!!! and buy it!!!
4,dragonlady of Spokane,"I don't have alot to say about this book as I have not completed it as of yet. But I will say that I have done at least one to two spreads that have made the money paid for it wothwhile. The layout allowed me to see directly into karmic cause and effect, which was very helpful to my client. Very, very effective. I have recently started a tarot consulting business, and I am waiting for the right oppertunity to use this book.I am sure it will again prove its usefulness.Recommend to advanced intermediate, to the advanced student. Especially helpful if your strong intuitivly."
3,nothing special..,"If it was not for Will Ferrell, I would give this movie 2 stars at most. The movie is too predictable and the rest of the cast is not too brilliant. Ferrell, on the other hand, is still as funny and clumsy as ever. Yeah, there were some funny scenes but all of them involved Ferrell. So, if you are a big fan of Ferrell you might like this movie, but if his name does not ""ring a bell"", than you might find it rather dull and not very funny."
1,What a disaster,I can't believe this man is a serious writer.Has the man ever heard of a contraction? I got through the first 30 pages and thought surely this must be written by a teenager who has obviously never had a lesson in sentence and paragraph structure.What a waste of 16 bucks..How did he ever find a publisher?
4,"Keiko Matsui's ""Full Moon and the Shrine""","Around 6 months ago, my dad got me this CD. Since he knew that I like piano music, he got it, even though he had never heard of Keiko Matsui in his life. That was an incredibly lucky guess. I admit that I was surprised at how good this CD was. The music on it is a nice blend of easy listening with a pinch of jazz. It is the type of CD that, no matter how repetitive it gets, you really like anyway. In my opinion, the way that the songs are put together is very creative.In short, if you like easy listening and/or contemporary music, get this CD. If you like jazz, but don't like the other 2 genres, then don't even think about it."
1,"new age, not jazz","A jazz traditionalist, I was disappointed. She's definitely not Thelonious, or Chick Corea, or even Marcus Roberts. Not jazz improvisation, but new-age repetition. I am reminded of words I once read in review of similar music . . . ""mindless musical meanderings."""
3,boxers,"These are a standard underwear item that my son likes to wear so I ordered them. They arrived as expected and are fine. All cotton briefs like this shrink when washed, so for any buyer, wash cold only and hang to dry."
3,"""Inconsistent""--not good in racing.","While a nice effort; Latford's book appears to be directed at newer fans of the sport; as opposed to the long-term ones.Points are shaved off for poor photo quality; many photos appear blurry; and/or a poor crop/scan. The cover photo; while vintage; was a drawback for me--a photo from 1992/93 on the cover of a 1999 book doesn't sell well...new fans; whom the content seems directed to; probably had no clue as to who was pictured on the cover.Oh, and could Latford not find a synonym for ""queued""?"
2,"Not bad, but not my favorite in this line of books","This book is much busier than most of the other books in the series. The pages are crowded with images, and if your child has specific names for some of the items (like plane, instead of airplane) it is a little bit difficult to teach the letter associations.Also, the two-page spreads usually feature more than one letter, intermixed. This is distracting. I'd rather have paid more money for a larger book that differentiates the letters more.Usually these books feature a bold pop up at the page fold. This book uses a variety of lift the flap and pop-up techniques. Because of this, the alphabet book is less durable than others in the line. I have had to make repairs to several well-loved figures with glue and tape.I really like the Snappy line of books, but don't feel that this is the best representation of their line."
2,Post-producers of this DVD failed,"The first DVD is historically interesting, but the post production is annoying. It seems like a twelve-year-old on speed has worked on a dvd programme to spoil all the films on this dvd! Besides the fact that a lot of the films were taken by only one camera operated by incompetent operators (example: the lead guitar plays a solo, but the camera zooms on the rhythm guitar) the post producers overlayed everything with ""psychodelic effects"" which make it impossible to see anything relevant. I can't understand how a production company in the 21st century allows this stuff to be sold to the public! Nevertheless it's interesting to see the history of this fabulous band with some tragic moments when ""Fito"" is the only one to keep things going."
4,different but still good,"After many hard listens to this cd, I have come to the conclusion that it does stand up as another great Cro Mags release. Yes, it does have more ballads than one would expect but they are so well written and the combination of ""Age of Quarrel"" singer Jon Joseph & ""Best Wishes"" singer Harley flannigan is truely a treat to the ears. This album has the best of both worlds, although is not as good as the afore mentioned titles. Simply your collection is not complete without Alpha Omega, the third Cro Mags release."
3,cro-mags grown up and divided,"if your loooking for age og quarrel or best wishs this ain't it but there are some good writing in this but not much of the cromags original fury left but the have aged and divided and grown into a much more musically and mentally advanced force some may say,me they got older and softened up and lost alot of what made them hard core legends.the edge is not there that set them apart from the rest of the pack but this is not a total falure just not a sucess for them just another stepping stone and mile marker in the cromags road.I'd recamend revenge 100% over this cd but this cd is still better than near death experiance."
5,"By itself, a great album...","First of all, we cannot pretend to get the latest album of our favorite group playing in the same way than their first demo tape. For their die-hard fans, Cro-Mags had to stay in their niche forever, playing the same hardcore and getting old at the CBGB (if you're one of them, don't buy it and save your money). Obviously ""Alpha-Omega"" hasn't much in common with previous albums like ""Age of Quarrel"" or ""Best Wishes"" but, not from the point of view of hardcore but from heavy metal (or whatever you name it) this is a GREAT ALBUM. Clean sound, powerful riffs, Harley Flanagan singing at his best. Do we need something else? NOP, they did a really good job. Congratulations and Cro-Mags forever!!!"
5,Reading for College,"If you want to make your blood boil and if you like to see red, this is the book for you. I don't want to grandstand and this is not the forum to be cavalier but this guy got what he deserved.This is a true portrayal of Malcolm X written speech by speech. If you like being referred to as ""the cracker"" and ""Whitey"" or revere in the thought that this man is nothing more than a catalyst for a race riot... this book is for you. I just got a brand new outdoor fire-pit. I will probably use this book for kindling if I finish it before winter! My advice, read Martin Luther King if you want an well educated perspective on race relations."
5,Even nicer in hand,This necklace was a gift and she loved it. It is even prettier than the picture gives justice. I was a little nervous about the clasp bt my girlfriend really likes it because it is easy to put on. The brown cord is thick and makes a nice contrast with the blue/green of the stone.
5,Mutual Funds,"This is a great book to have in your library, whether it is an introduction to the topic, a refresher, or to fill in the blanks of what you already know. It discusses finance in easy-to-understand language and is great at clarifying its points. It was recommended to me by my employer, a leading financial advisor, who regularly recommends books on the subject. This is the first of many recommendations he made."
2,shipping issue,"They shipped it ""freight"" to Hawaii. Tack on three weeks minimum. The price was right, only $0.01 and $4.95 for shipping. It is a used library book."
4,"Great book, but I think it's Bill Beavis, not Beans","Good book, good illustrationsBut the illustrator of the book is Bill Beavis, not Bill Beans."
3,adaptation,"The music presented on this cd is like a very high class oriental restaurant catering to non-oriental customers. There's excellent cook, beautiful presentation, but lack of authenticity. Try listen to Chen Jie-bing and Yu Hong-mei. Pure soul of er-hu. Crystal sound of music. Thousands of years of happenings exposed. There's contemporary. And there's ancient. There's simple and beautiful and nostalgic. And there's new age. Pick your mood."
3,Not traditional,"Some good selections, but not the beautiful simple music of China. Too many other instruments get in the way of the erhu's beauty. I will look for something deeper."
3,For devoted fans,"This is an enjoyable Dvd for a true fan or someone wanting to know more about Daniel Lanois. While it is interesting and gives you good insite, it will not blow you away. He is so much more live, being a Grammy winning producer you would think he would be able to duplicate the rawness and the hard rocking music he can put on. So for a solid fan but others may find it okay and not watch more than once."
5,"Samael, the best black metal band in the world",This is the best work of Samael. Slow and heavy. Vocals from hell. I recommend this CD. END
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Not black metal, not really anything. Most of this album is like 80s Metallica played at half speed. There doesn't seem to be anything purposeful about the musical approach/style, it's just really amateurish. The vocals and occasional keyboard parts are the only things that show any trace of talent or make this album seem remotely comparable to the likes of Mayhem, Burzum, Darkthrone, Satyricon, or Bathory. The metal guitar, drumming, and production is more like a high school garage band. I can't comprehend how this album was made by the same band that made Passage."
1,Disapointing,"Buyer beware: The only thing that is being offered here is the painted solid dragon; the puzzle-like cave is not included. I bought this item mistakenly thinking that this was a kind of cool wooden puzzle, it's not. It is a sort of awkwardly painted wooden dragon that is pretty uninspired at best. Save your cash for something better."
4,A little too gentle,"I got this for my stainless steel skillet because it was getting brown stains from oil that were very difficult to remove without scratching the pan.Unfortunately, I still need to use steel wool to get the stains out, even with Bon Ami soaking in the pan. I have heard that heating some water and the Bon-Ami on the stove top helps, so I will try and change my review if so. However, conventional use makes it best for easier jobs."
5,Love this stuff,"I have a can under the kitchen sink and the bathroom sink! Great for stainless steel, bathroom sink, toilet, tub and the environment! Unlike other reviewers, I have found this in our local Giant food store, in the same isle as the other cleaning products. Can't live without it!"
5,love it,I love products that actually work -- This is my favorite cleaning products - and my favorite cleaning company ( besides Dr Bronner's Soaps ) -- they have a website too were you can buy the dish soap --- I wish they would have in local grocery stores but I have yet to find them -- they were at Aces but those have closed around me --- I am so glad I have found them on website -- I buy in bulk --- the products come the next day for me after ordering -- which also awesome ---- if you have never tried I would give them a try -- they work on everything -- bathrooms -kitchens -- dishes what ever your need is -- All you need is this and Barkeepers both are excellent products -- keeping it simple - using products our mothers and grandmothers used --
3,Great stuff but waaay too pricey on Amazon.,"This really is a very good cleaner for sinks and bathtubs. Wet the area you want to clean, powder on the Bon Ami, swirl it all around with a brush. Let stand for 15-30 minutes. Then scrub again and you won't believe the difference. If you leave it on for longer - like 20-30 minutes - you should mist it with some water a couple of times during the waiting cycle, to keep it moist and active.My only gripe with this is that I bought 6 of these on Amazon because I could not readily find them at a couple of the local grocery stores. Just after my purchase, I did find them at Shaw's for just USD1.19 (a dollar nineteen) apiece. I could have bought 25 of them for a lower total expenditure at Shaw's. Ouch. If not for that, I would give this 5 stars plus."
3,It's a surge protector...,"It's a surge protector, it's cheap, it hasn't failed me yet. With things like this you can really only tell how good it is AFTER disaster strikes. Thankfully I have not been struck yet."
5,A very good CD,"A very good Cd, where all music are of a so likely rythim, that estimulate you to sing together, one of the bests in the genre!!!! I can said, that this is one of the better Brazilian music CD"
2,"Dull, dull, dull","While the sex is plentiful in this book, it's not sensual or well written. The plot, if you can call it that, seems to be an after thought thrown in halfway through the book with a less than satisfactory ending. I won't be buying any more books by this author."
3,Three (Aphrodisia) by Noelle Mack,"I really liked the writing but thought that it was very straightforward about the topic. Wasnt bad but wasnt my favorite. All in all, a good buy second-hand."
2,Sex Scenes Numerous Plot Non Existent,"I don't even want to waste words on this. The sex scenes are the only reason I gave it 2 stars they are plentiful. However they are not as well written as they could have been and the plot itself, well I just can't find it."
1,TV not usable with iPod Classic,I have bought the ONKYO DS-A2X for my iPod Classic 80G.The sound from iPod comes realy good BUTyou are NOT able to see Photos or Videos if you have anew iPod Classic 80G/160G. Have not found something in the manual that this is not working. After looking up the ONKYO site they have listed the iPod Classic under the Audio only category.It's shame that the Instruction is not clear on this point.Having now a device that is not usable makes me a little angry - so be warned if you have an iPod Classic.[...]
3,It's A-ight,"Pros: Styling, Ease of Setup, onscreen Display, Onkyo Receiver interactivity, adjustable dock size (depth to accommodate different Ipods), remote capability, dock charges ipodCons: RCA Jacks only (what year is it??), onscreen Graphics match the outdated jacks (Atari Style Font), screensaver is merely a blank screen (at least you can pick a solid color ooooooooh), remote sensitivityIf the remote wasn't so handy I would take it back and get a nice RCA to headphone jack split cable"
3,Good but not Great,The only real problem I have with this is the same problem I have found with everything apple and that is getting a remote to work on my 3rd gen Ipod. The dock remote works pretty well but trying to get my receiver remote to work has been tasking. If you have an onkyo receiver and want to stay branded get it. The actual dock itself has presented no problems.
1,what a piece of junk,Worthless and over priced. You can only control the ipod through the remote while watching the video off the video port. Why Onkyo choose to lock the ipod display & controls I don't understand. I finally just threw this $80 paper weight in the trash.
3,OSD is ugly,"Compared to the gorgeous display on iPod, the On-Screen-Display that the dock generates on the TV is not intuitive and is ugly. The manufacturers seem to have picked the most unattractive font for the display.Dock also charges the iPod which cannot be turned off. This forces me to put the iPod on charge every time I want to listen to music using iPod on my home theater system. This seriously damaged the battery life of my previous iPod."
4,onkyo review,"the product is excellent but is not possible to change the volume of the ipod with the remote control unless you use the onkyo amplifier, and that's different that the situation that I imagine. Nollmann"
1,Worst book I have ever read,"Basically a ""Leaving Las Vegas"" copy taking place in Tehran. Aresh the main character returns to Iran and goes on a path of self destruction for no valid reason. It is terrible that the trend in Iranian books and movies is that the more depressing it is made and the sorrier you are for the characters the more awards it wins."
4,Not Bad!,"The sophomore ""Late Night Special"" has hot beats and hot lyrics. Mixed with slow grooves, nice vocals, and sexy raps. This album compared to Bluestars is a bit more on the adult level than the last. They're really showing a lot of improvement in the music industry that should get more praise. I would recommend it to all fans and even new listeners.Favorite Tracks:On the HotlineStayLove Like HoneySo ConfusedLate Night SpecialPersonal Trainer"
4,Pretty Ricky's #1 Fan,I liked all of the songs except for the up tempo. I think if artists can sing then that's what they should do.
3,"Sex,Sex,Sex....I think we get the point now!","This Cd was ok,It was all about sex as usual but i feel that their first album was better!I'll be glad when Pleasure drop his solo album."
4,Folk Dance and Celebration Along the Nile,"This large group of thirteen folk musicians and singers are Egyptian Romanies, or gypsies, who travel along the Nile to perform at weddings, festivals, and Muslim rites, which is to say the traditional and historic role of itinerate musicians and minstrels. Their songs here are of romance and longing. Their instruments are dominated by unique double-tubed instruments of single reed (the magrouna) and double reeds (the mazmar), plus a rebab fiddle, frame drums (the duff), a sort of hour-glass shaped brass drum (the doholla), and the similar but ceramic Egyptian tabla or dumbek. Their music is intense, joyful, and rhythmic, hence supportive of dance and celebration. This is music of the village."
3,typo hell,"There were more typographical errors in the hardback version of this book than in any other book I've ever encountered. Several sentences were missing key words... and that was the least of it. It rather ruined my reading experience, and the publisher ought to be ashamed."
2,Frustrating.,"At its best, it's quite funny. But at its worst, this book is snarky and obnoxious (and, alas, about what you'd expect given the author's work history). Not to mention the profanity, which was a real disappointment, and made the author look juvenile. At the fourth or fifth expostulation of ""Jesus!"" I got fed up. And that was only 50 pages in. It's a very amusing idea, but I'm not convinced enough that it'll sustain a 350-page book that I want to read the next 300 pages of this. Next time get an editor who'll make this book accessible to people beyond the look-aren't-I-clever-and-naughty set."
3,"Good bathroom reading, nothing more","Reasonably well informed readers will find about 50% of this is refresher reading, nothing new regarding the facts. At times there is some repetition, working the same facts into different accounts and in a couple of places I think the obscure cross reference came before the tale referred to. I am not sorry I bought it but really can't strongly recommend it"
2,Bordering on insufferable,"Okay, AJ.Thanks for telling us how cerebral you, your father, your friends and all of yr relatives are.This is a gimmicky book, that is indeed written in a blog-like observational me-me-me style.A little drama is introduced by his quest to impregnate his wife. Shockingly, she gets pregnant.Painfully superficial, facts indeed pass for knowledge in this book.Despite his fascination with himself, one gets the sense that AJ on some level can't stand himself; and that while his father writes law books, AJ writes about shoes for Esquire; and ultimately, AJ kind of finds himself inadequate and distasteful.So do I."
1,Wrong Book!,Some time back I had read A BRIEF HISTORY OF EVERYTHING by Bill Bryson and was really impressed by the book. Enormous amount of information bundled in a nicely written book. Nice to see the exotic information in a single book.I was expecting something similar when I picked this book. Sadly I was wrong. The book is more on author's comments than information. Not my kind of book. Not recommended.
2,Eh didn't do it for me,"My parents gave me this book as a tribute to my ""Know it all attitude"" which I read thinking it would be funny. It started out alright but eventually turned out to be a ""blog"" about a man crying to be smarter and better than everyone else with his brain. I'm sorry but if I wanted to read someone's complaint diary I would've gotten Briget Jone's Diary or something. This book is not full of the interesting factoids you would think of. Borrow it from the library instead."
3,A little exhausting,"I enjoyed the book for his anecdotes ancillary to the primary quest of reading the encyclopedia. His relationship with his father and wife were the heart of the experience. But the 'Entry-joke-popculture reference' schtick over and over and over again got progressively more exhausting. 'Hey an Anna Nicole Smith joke...nobody has done that before.' The references and repetitive chapter formula eventually turned it into a bit of a tedious reading experience.Still, an interesting quest and a relatively quick read. Something to stick in between Pulitzers...or Encyclopedia's."
4,Interesting.,"I really like this author. He's has humorous insight. I like his book ""The Year of Living Biblically"" is my favorite, though."
1,Paperback cheaper than eBook,"Another Penguin pricing cluster. Are they really this stupid, I keep asking myself? Maybe they are just fighting the march towards electronic books over paper. Maybe they have too much sunk costs invested in large offset print shops that they feel the need to keep churning out antiquated dead trees and glue. Either way, I would love to read this book but will never buy an ebook for more than a paper version. Keep spitting into the wind, Penguin. Signed...a prolific reader."
1,Know what you're buying,"This is not a book of trivia. It is a memoir with trivia in it. If you want an uneventful memoir this is your book. Much of the trivia is not informative, thought provoking or even cocktail conversational (if that is a term). If you want a trivia book there are some very good ones. Try the Uncle John's bathroom reader series. Do not be put off by the name. The material it covers is not crude."
1,oh please...!,"This is the first book I have ever considered actually throwing in the trash can. The writer with his sophmoric humor is just too much to stand. He is so smug; he really thinks he is funny and oh so very clever. If I met him at a cocktail party I would lose him fast. Blah blah blah...give me a break and just shut up. Oh yeah, I can just close the book and silence your pointless sillines. That's what I did.""Humble quest""...hahaha---there is nothing humble about the author or this book full of useless facts linked together as an autobiography."
1,Not so smart when the title isn't even correct,"You don't become smart by reading a bunch of stuff - you may become more knowledgeable, but I doubt that this increases one's intelligence."
1,Boring,"I found this book totally boring. I was very disappointed, since I had heard excellent reviews about it. I was not expecting to read about the author's personal life throughout the whole book.I would never recommend it."
1,Immature writing,Totally do not waste your time on this book. It is insulting to the reader it is so badly written and his political jabs (against conservatives/Republicans) are thinly veiled and completely unwarranted and misplaced.
1,"When you publicize a blog, this is the result.",The only time you want to read it is when you are on the throne. It gets boring really fast. Another reason to question what has become of good journalism headquartered in New York. Really?
2,A bit of a roller coaster...,"I agree with some of the negative reviews which focus on how annoying the writer is... Maybe he just falls into too many of my own personal pet peeve categories, including- neurotic.- germaphobe.- name-dropper (even about his own family, his own schooling, his own teachers...)- mama's boy.- self-styled humorist.The format is original and fun, and I did enjoy getting the Cliff's Notes version of many of the EB's entries. But half of them had lame little punchlines tacked onto them - boo to that."
2,not worth it,thought this would provide interesting trivia tidbits. It was just a guy trying to be funny and not succeeding.
2,Just like the encyclopedia.....long and boring,"I got this book from the library thinking that it might be witty and full of biting sarcasim. The real truth of the matter is, it is a boring read. I kind of enjoy some of the little bits of infomration that is sprinkled throughout, however, it gets monotemous and tedious. I'm only up to the ""G's"" and not sure if I will go on or just pick up something much lighter...like the dictonairy."
4,"Very witty, maybe too long by 100 pages","I couldn't help myself. I found myself saying, ""honey, did you know..."", more than a few times. Information is contagious and it led me too additional research. AJ is brave to expose so many of his foibles in the 300+ pages. A very intertaining read for those that are curious about anything and everything."
4,Why do so many men marry their cousins?,"A fun book; a sort of biography mixed into encyclopedia enteries. It's hard not to like a book based on random odd facts and, by entwining the events of his life with the entires, A.J. manages to make this as much an auto-biographical novel as a book of odd facts. Regretably, Jacobs is pretty much a jackass."
4,Like a younger Woody Allen,"Jacobs' tone gets whiny from time to time, but his neuroses and the constant asides into his and his wife's attempts to have a child make it a fun read."
5,Informative and Whimsical,"If someone else not named A.J. Jacobs had decided to take on the daunting and self-important task of reading all of the editions of the Encylopedia Britannica and telling us about it, the book probably would have reeked of pretention and pedantry.Not so with The Know It All. Jacobs blends useful (and not so useful) information with the right amount of self-deprecation and humor to make a condensed form of the Britannica entirely readable and enjoyable. He also incorporates his own struggles (winning the approval of his smug brother-in-law, trying to get pregnant) to make this book not all about encyclopedia entries, but about how Jacob's quest affects his life as Esquire editor and devoted husband.If the Britannica entries were written by Jacobs, we would probably read a few pages every now and then instead of using them as handy leather-bound coasters for our drinks."
5,Laugh Out Loud Funny,This book was so much fun that I carried it around with me long after I had finished reading it so that I could read parts aloud to anyone and everyone who would tolerate me. I loved this book.
5,Hilarious romp through Britannica,"This is a super-fun book, not to be read to gain encyclopedic knowledge, but in order to follow the funny and sweet travels of A.J. Jacobs through the various tomes of the Britannica. Jacobs takes something we can all identify with, the fear of being ignorant, and transforms it into year long journey exploring not only some of the strangest entries in the encyclopedia, but his personal life and family as well as the culture of knowledge-mania as he attends Mensa meetings and becomes a contestant on ""Jeopardy"" and ""Who Want to Be a Millionaire""In less capable hands, such a collection of unrelated trivia would be hard to get through. But Jacobs cleverly weaves the disparate anecdotes together in such a way that the reader is pleasantly drawn from one scene into the next and graceful connections are made from the encyclopedia entries to the events in the authors day to day life."
2,Distracting Spelling Errors,"Distracting Spelling ErrorsI found the spelling errors extremely distracting. The subject matter demands accuracy along with humor. I was shocked when I read the first few errors, but angry after several more popped up. The editors cut corners but I still paid full price. Mr. Jacobs I think you are an interesting person but you got let down when you sent this off to be printed. It only took me seconds to verify my spelling for this review in a word processor. Your people should have done the same. You should demand a public apology from your editor."
2,Book Has Great Potential But Putters Out,"I feel like this author tries too hard to be witty, self-deprecating, and funny when it's not natural. I liked the premise of the book and it did inspire me to learn, but the author is just not that captivating or likeable (even in a jerky know-it-all way). It's hard for me to get through this book, which is unusual for me."
3,"Amusing, but still mediocre","This is a easy read about the author's quest to read the entire Encycolopedia Brittanica. The story is more about the author's personal life, which truthfully, is quite boring. I finished this book, and wasn't dissapointed that I read it, but I would never suggest it as a read. Sorry AJ."
4,The Know It All,Well it is a gift for my son who loves to read the encyclopedia. I haven't given it to him yet but I did look throught it and it looks great.
1,Snarky drivel.,"The word humble should not appear anywhere near the title of this book. It is as self-indulgent, pretentious and smarmy as you might expect coming from the editor of a magazine that embodies all of these same dubious qualities. I read it through to the end, and don't know why I did; it clearly was not going to get any better after the first twenty pages or so. Save your time and money."
1,Tired of hearing about their infertility,"Not much information or fascinating trivia, but you do find out the author and his wife have a problem with infertility and you have to hear about it no less than 20 times during the duration of the book."
2,Mixed bag,"On the good side, the book has some really funny laugh-out-loud sections. On the bad side we have too much of the author's personal life. He comes off as an insecure, immature, neurotic, spoiled rich kid. By the end of the book, I really didn't like him.It's also interesting to note the author's appaling ignorance. He is a graduate of a highly rated college, and his lack of knowledge, especially about history and religon, surprised me."
4,this too shall pass,"hello all, i enjoyed reading his books. A.J.seems like a jerk(from knowledge of reading his biblical book and how he acted towards his wife's friends), but i still enjoy the facts he shared from his experience. Although i do have a question, what is the difference between knowledge and intelligence? Please email me your replies. e_webner@hotmail.com i was very amazed to hear about that Nagasaki was not the original x spot for the atomic bomb a realization of mine that hit kinda hard. b/c you really begin to realize the whole, wow think of all the saved lives part, but all in all a good book, well written and interesting."
2,Too bad the book was mainly about the author and not about the trivia,"I wanted to love this book since I'm a big fan of pointless facts and trivia. Unfortunately, the real focus of this book was the author's life and his quest, not the facts he was learning. When he wrote about the various obscure items that he came across in the encyclopedia his observations were amusing and interesting. However, in his personal life, he comes off as whiny and neurotic. He has an inferiority complex so big that he just can't resist spouting his mouth off at inappropriate times in a useless attempt to prove to everyone how ""smart"" he is. If you have a Kindle, sample this book first and from that, decide if you are okay with the author's tone. I could tell from the sample that he was whiny but because I didn't realize that so much of the book was about him rather than about all the fascinating things in the encyclopedia, I made the mistake of buying it anyway."
1,I can't read any more of this,"I made it to the end of letter F. This is a rambling book about an uninteresting person doing something ridiculous. I agree that the premise of reading the Brittanica front to back sounds like an interesting idea for a book, but it should have been obvious after a couple of letters that a novel would fail to be interesting in execution. This could make for good bathroom reading and I may skim the rest of it, but it is tedious and boring to go page by page. I'd rather read the encyclopedia myself."
2,"Not nearly as good as ""The Year of Living Biblically""","I picked up this book after reading his other book ""The Year of Living Biblically."" I found that book to be funny and surprisingly insightful. This book, on the other hand, was fairly boring. I didn't even finish reading it."
3,Too much bragging,"I love the year of living biblically and I like the experiments book, but this book has a different tone that the others. The author talks too much about stupid, mean and rude this that he did and has done. I recommend his other two books over this one."
5,"Great, interesting read","Once I started to read this, I couldn't put it down! It was a great read and provides a lot of interesting info about the Bible."
4,The Know It All by A.J. JACOBS,"I purchased the audio version of this book as a gift for my 66year old father to listen while commuting to and from work. He said he thought the book was ""Entertaining"" and almost as good as Jacobs other book ""The Year of Living Biblically"".What more could you want from an audiobook? Really??"
4,Well worth it.,"I wasn't sure how this book would be, as I'm not one to read the Encyclopedia Brittanica, but A. J. Jacobs has me laughing out loud. I think I've read so many parts to my husband at the breakfast table, that he's almost got the whole book down. It's written with great wit and comical insights. My brother told me about it, and I'm so glad I purchased it."
5,Whale Poop etc.,"A.J. Jacobs, a very clever fellow has written a wonderfully entertaining tale. For most of us, The Encyclyopedia Britannica is a stop and shop, extract your info and leave, the author has dedicated himself to the task of reading all twentysomething volumes. Jacobs then redigests the info in his book. He wants to be the smartest person in the world,( philogest) an admirable quest, and of course the more he knows the dumber he feels. His personal life is adversly effected (his wife becomes a encylopedia widow) he becomes competitive with his older brother for bragging rights in the brain department, his co workers belittle him etc. The great thing about this book is that you can read it in segments, for it is organized like an encyclopedia, but unlike an encyclopedia, it is very, very funny. Pick it up, for you too can be a ""know it all""."
5,As a Psychiatrist....,"I truly found A.J.'s book engaging on several levels.Without getting into any assumptions, let me just say that I enjoyed his book and appreciate his extraordinary effort in this project.It is most definitely an enjoyable read, and quite humorous throughout.I would NOT say that it is meant as a shortened reference form of the E.B. however, as some seem to indicate.Instead, I think he has written yet another book that shows his willingness and ability to set a difficult goal and to attain it, all the while learning more about himself as a human being.Be well,Dr. Ferraioliwww.drferraioli.comAuthor, ""Cobwebs And Ugly Wallpaper"""
5,"Russ Columbo Set, A Great Release For Your Collection","The same 2 people are spewing negative information regarding our Russ Columbo CD set that I produced, on several websites, and their opinions are not factual...the set was made from the actual metal masters at RCA/BMG (not all have survived over the 70+ years) and they were supervised by me and BMG engineer Dennis Ferrante. In cases where the masters no longer existed, we used BMG archive tapes to work from. We worked on these tracks for a long time to improve the quality (they sounded very rough to begin with, especially by today's standards), and have received several letters complementing us on this set. We have developed a great reputation for quality at Taragon, and we take all criticism very seriously, because we do care. I hope you will buy this collection, and as with any other recordings you purchase, be your own judge.Eliot GoshmanTaragon Records Companyeliot@taragon.com"
5,An Excellent Primer on Prints,"This book, although 20 years old, is an excellent introduction to collecting prints. It explains the different print processes, what to look for in an etching, etc. It also discusses why some Picasso prints are worth triple a nearly identical one. Very good basic information (if you can find it).If you are interested in etchings, drypoints, engravings, woodcuts, etc. this is a good book. Other books cover offset lithography in more depth.Well written basic info, I enjoyed it."
4,The Words of Jesus,"The bookseller responded by e-mail to a question regarding the book I was ordering. My question was answered to my satisfaction, and I placed the order. I was happy with the service. This was an Amazon Verified Purchase."
3,3.5 stars,"Shadows in the Deep itself is not all that good.But if you can get the new one that has across the Open sea,I would.Across the open Sea is a much better album in my opinion,both song-structure and soundwise.Yet it seems to be overlooked.However,I'm a collector,so I must have Shadows in the Deep.If anything it does have a unique sound,especially for it's '92 release.I love Johnny Hedlunds vocals!So I give this double-album 3.5 stars,mostly for Across the Open Sea."
5,"Nor is it Shadows of the Deep, but Shadows IN the Deep","BTW, this album is very good, as are all there albums. Pick any one you want and you won't be disappointed!"
4,Great for Advanced Dancers,"This video is a wonderful tool for advanced dancers who already have some practice balancing. it is definitely NOT for beginners, as it includes a fair amount of floor undulations and shimmy layering, but advanced or professional dancers will find it challenging and fun. Amira Mor has a fantastic stage personality, and is fun to watch in all of her videos as well as easy to follow in her break-downs.The only major flaw I notices in this video is a violation of bellydance-rule-number-one: When in a skimpy costume, wear panties!"
3,Incomplete,"This edition doesn't contain the extra appendices from the second edition published after his death, including Richthofen's notes for a sequal and his brother Lothar's eyewitness account of his death and burial. Pass this one up and keep looking for a complete copy, or else how are you going to read the story of the Red Baron and the nun?"
4,Vivid pictures and a captivating rhyme,"This is a great book to give as a gift. With bright illustrations and a fun rhyming text, it is fun to read over and over again. I also like the new twist on the old message - that a person (or lizard) is a person no matter how small."
1,Don't Waste Your Time Reading,"I found the book to be utterly boring, and completely unbelievable. I don't recommend this book for readers that enjoy reading. The title leads you to believe the book will be good. The characters are believable to an extent, but Rhoda and her family was completely unrealistic. A black man good friends with a wealthy Italian in the 1960's? Yeah right. I don't care if they were middle class blacks or not. And Annette as far as a friend to Rhoda was absolutely ridiculous. They had nothing in common. The entire storyline was corny."
1,I Hated It!,"This book was awful.I don't know if it was the continuous sexual abuse, Annette endured that got to me, or if it was, Mary Monroe's poor writing style.My criticism is with how, Mary failed to give her characters depth and emotions. It was all just detached, surface reading considering she never took her readers into the character's minds. I realize this was Mary's first novel, and she acknowledged being a self-taught writer. So maybe that explains it, but either way, I hated it!"
5,Awesome!,This book was awesome! Mary Monroe wrote from a realistic perspective and dealt with true-to-life issues. Life is difficult when you're treated as an outcast because you are different. Mary Monroe dealt with these issues superbly!
1,totally dissapointed,"This book was good if you want to get depressed. It didnt seem to have any conclusion at all. I'm still waiting for the point of it. I'm an avid reader, especially of black authors and I must say I was very dissapointed in this. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,IT's OkaY,"The title alone grasped my attention. I check God Still Don't Like Ugly from library and I was kinda lost in the book and I had to stop reading it when I found out it was A squeal. Then I check out God Don't like Ugly from library. What I have to say about this book is the author is a good writer, and she very detailed/descriptive. However, I was disappointed in the main character,Annette; For example, the way she allowed people to mistreat her and I just could not understand her reasoning for her not defending herself. Rhoda was a true friend and she did not like seeing Annette getting hurt.I didn't like how Annette suffered for so long and her mom did not have a clue. Then when Rhoda killed Mr Buttwright LOL, Annette started to annoyed me. I have the second book so I will read it but cant recommend it yet. I did like Gonna Lay Down My Burdens by this author it was much better book."
3,Excited but abrubtly disappointed,"I was really excited to get into this audio until I was to go to the next disc and discovered that it was missing. When listening to audio books each disc covers many chapters of the book. Needless to say there was a pretty big chunk of the story that I missed due to the missing disc, not to mention the second disc of the book skipped every other track. I really enjoyed the story, but I wished I would have had everything that I purchased."
2,Boring and unrealistic....,"This book was SLOOOOOW and unnecessarily long. The author repeated herself, made goofs in the storyline, created characters with no depth or real emotion, and she is in dire need of a thesaurus. I don't think I will ever be able to hear the work ""incredulous"" again without thinking of this book. In addition, as someone who listened to the audio book I was tremendously disappointed with the performer (I guess that's what they are called) who stumbled on words and made no attempt to hide her swallowing and smoking sounds as she spoke. It was often gross to hear."
2,Lacks Purpose,The book is too slow and drags out the sexual abuse for far too long. Annette was defeated from the beginning and she never achieved any victory at least from what I can tell as far as chapter 25. I am really not sure if I will be able to complete this book and I wouldn't pass it on to anyone.
2,Long Read,"It took me along time to finally get through this one. It was very slow at the beginning, and ended up being alittle bit too predictable. Annette made me think she really enjoyed the relationship between her and Mr. Boatwright, and her mother was alittle bit too naive. Rhoda and her whole family were unrealistic, and the whole story seemed not to have a point. I thought it would be better than what it turned out to be."
5,CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE!!!!,"You Go Ms. Monroe!!! I have been known to predict where a story is going; Not so with ""God don't like ugly"" It starts out typical and then flips the switch on you. What a great ride! ""God STILL don't like ugly"" can't arrive fast enough!!!"
2,Distasteful,"No wonder why it took me so long to read this novel. The storyline was horrible. I almost couldn't tolerate to continue to read, chapter after chapter, the visual rape of a young child all the way through her adulthood by a crippled old man. It was so disgusting. It makes me wonder why an author would choose to write such a story. There was nothing inspirational about the story. It is a deep, dark, and gloomy novel. If God Didn't Like Ugly, then why would he allow this awful man to continue to rape this innocent girl repeatedly during the course of several years? A more appropriate title would be: ""God Ain't Got Nutin To Do Wit It."" I understand there's a sequel called God Still Don't Like Ugly, but I don't think I'll be reading it. Can't stand the thought of this story. A 2.0 on the SmithScale."
2,I wanted to like this book,"After reading some of the other reviews about this book I decided to try it out. I really wanted to like it. The book is written in a child's voice, but the subject matter is very adult. I just don't find this kind of reading enjoyable. I know that stuff like this happens in real life; but I like to read fiction to take me away from the gruesomeness of the world, and its abuses."
5,Sacrificial Lamb,"A beautiful, warm, emotionally touching sorry. This is by far one of the best books I've read. When your in a situation such as the one Annette was one could only imagine how hard it would be to keep such a miserable secret to herself. Keeping in mind the time frame then compared to now, helps us appreciate that we should thank God that times have progressed to the point we don't have to keep ugly secrets as sexual abuse a secret. Each character was interesting in their own way. The power of love truly transends from the heart of a little girl who sacrificed herself for the love of her mother. I love a fast paced book, the action was non-stop. I am so looking forward to your next book. This was the first book of yours I've read and just judging by this wonderful accomplishment of yours it certainly will not be the last. You are going on my list of authors."
3,Depressing but Interesting,"Annette's storyline was very depressing. If it hadn't been for the inclusion of Rhoda, I would have stopped reading the book after the first few chapters. I think Rhoda should have been the protagonist--not Annette. How many persons can say they have a friend like Rhoda who risked so much to help them? Other elements in the book were so incredibly pathetic that I wanted to rip the book to shreds. For example, in later years, Annette regrets having an abortion as the result of rape; her mother admits to having an affair with the rapist (although she doesn't know about the rape); Annette wants to pursue a relationship with her low-down father; Annette turns down office jobs to continue working in a greasy factory; and Annette has the nerve to discontinue her relationship with Rhoda when she should have been worshipping the ground on which Rhoda walked. WHAT WAS THE AUTHOR THINKING??"
3,Review,It's was an alright book.................it wasn't what I was expecting it to be.....Annette couldn't have been that gullible. The end
2,Read Toni Morrison or Maya Angelo instead,"I read this because the author was likened to Maya Angelo and Toni Morrison. They each wrote a book dealing with a young African American girl being raped (""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" and ""The Bluest Eye"", respectively). It is not an insult when I say that Mary Monroe is no Toni Morrison--no one else is. Only one artist is Leonardo da Vinci. ""The Bluest Eye"" was Toni Morrison's first book, and although she has implied that it is her weakest, it is a much more powerful book than ""God Don't Like Ugly."" If you like this book, then you should read ""The Bluest Eye."" Maya Angelo's book ""I know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" is also a beautifully written classic."
3,God Don't Like Ugly,"I listened to this book on tape during my daily commute, and it held my attention, the characters were interesting, but the situations were somewhat unbelievable. My biggest issues were handling the descriptive nature of the sexual abuse of Annette by ""Buttwright""; I almost stopped listening because of that. It's hard to imagine a 7 year old being raped by an old man. I also thought Annette was a little stupid, and her mama for allowing the oppression that plagued both their lives.But my biggest irritation, came from the author's multiple use of the word ""incredulous""."
5,Juicy Book!!!,I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book! It was well written and very interesting! I didn't want the story to end and perhaps Mary Monroe will think about writing a sequel. I would definitely recommend the book to others!
3,NOT SO FOND OF PRETTY,"THIS BOOK WAS WELL WRITTEN AND THE STORY WAS WELL DEVELOPED.THE PROBLEM I HAD WAS THE FACT THAT ANNETTE ALLOWED THE SECUAL ABUSE TO GO ON FOR YEARS AND SHE DISN;T STOP IT ONCE SHE WAS OLD ENOUGH AND COULD PROBABLY HURT OLD BOATRIGHT (MAYBE WITH HIS OWN PEGGED LEG). HER MOTHER WAS TOO TRUSTING OF THIS STRANGE MAN JUST BECAUSE HE WAS INTRODUCED BY THE CHURCH.RHONA WAS A DEMON AND I THINK SHE WAS PROUD OF HER OWN ACTIONS. WHAT HAPPENED TO HER BABY WAS THE PRICE SHE HAD TO PAY.ALSO TO GRANNY GOOSE ,THE POLICEMAN AND APRIL. DAVID WAS A VICTIM."
2,I don't think God liked this book.,"Maybe this book was better than I thought because I actually rooted AGAINST the character. I mean, it got THAT out of me, at least."
4,GOOD READ!!!!,"I LIKED THIS BOOK, ALTHOUGH I HATED TO READ ABOUT THE TRAGEDIES THAT ANNETTE SUFFERED THROUGH AS A CHILD. WHAT DOES NOT KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER AND THAT IS EXACTLLY WHAT IT DID WITH ANNETTE. IT ALSO HELPED THAT SHE HAD THE SHOULDER OF HER BEST FRIEND, RHODA, TO LEAN ON. THEY STUCK TOGETHER WHEN THEY NEEDED EACHOTHER THE MOST. THIS BOOK HAS IT'S SHARE OF DRAMA AND IT KEEPS YOUR ATTENTION WONDERING WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT!!! THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPEN THAT YOU HAVE TO READ IT TO FIND OUT!!!!!"
4,God really doesn't like ugly...,"I've never read a book by Mary Monroe, but boy does she capture your attention as soon as you start to read. The characters are so powerful, which I started to doubt if Annette would come out of her shell and see that looks aren't everything. The book was great. You were in the shoes of Annette, so you started to fill her pain through her experience. Mary Monroe did a wonderful job writing this book. It was hard to put down, but I did to get some sleep. :) Happy Reading..."
3,This Book Was Ugly,"God Don't Like Ugly is an understatement! The Author took this story in so many directions that she could have written another book. Annette's love and trust in her mother, should have allowed her to tell her about the awful things that were happening to her. Her obesity was never fully covered which was a problem within itself. Rhoda STRONG ISSUES!!! Rhoda's issues were never addressed. She had major issues that should have been discussed and maybe she and Annette's friendship could have developed and they both could have had true happy ending. Florence was the strongest and most positive character, it's too bad she came in at the end. We hope there will not be a sequel because there is so much rape, molestation and overeating that a reader can take in one book!Sisters Interested in Reading (SIR)"
5,A shocking and good book,"I had no intention of buying this book, but something about the cover caught my eye. After reading the jacket I thought ok sounds good I love sistafriend books.Every character in this book reminded me of someone I once knew or someone in my family. If I had a gun I would've shot Mr Boatright, Annette's mother truly got on my nerves with her not seeing self. How can you nto see your child in pain and agony, how can you not see a child has a secret she needs to tell.I loved the Rhonda character, she was made out as a princess to Annette but Annette saw through her glass house and realized she had cracks in her windows just like she did. The friendship and secrets they shared I thought would bond them forever, but what tore them apart was enough strain for anyone.There's another character in the book I loved but her name escapes me shewas the blind girl who had the gift of knowing and the insight of a grandma."
4,"Excellent book about self-esteem, secrets, and more","This good was a great read from beginning to end, the characters captured you from the beginning.The story is surrounds Annette, a young black, obese, and poor woman. Her family is dirt poor and her father leaves Annette and her mother to fend for themselves, for a white woman. Annette is trouble with moving from month to month, until her mother lands a job for Judge Lawson . . a wealthy black judge who let them rent one of his homes.Enter Mr. Boatright....a God-fearing church going man moves into the household as a grandfather figure to Annette. From day one this spells nothing but a life of misery and sexual abuse for the little 7 or 8 year old....This books has twists and turns that leave you wanting to read page after page... It is really a book about how someone can try to shatter your self-esteem, self-confidence and all of those other self words...This is a must read!!!"
5,Great Book,I thought this was the best book I have every read. I don't think I could ever find a book that can make you feel as if you were right there with them. I loved the way it was written. It really just drawns you in. You feel what each character is going through. I had never read a book by Mary Monroe. I would read other books by her now that I read this one. She did a great job. I am a fan now.
2,A So-So Book,"With some reviews typed in CAPS and others with an abundance of !!!!s, I expected an extraordinary tale. The beginning of the book held my interest, but as it went on my mind started to wander until I could not wait to reach the end of this book. I even googled for spoilers to get it over with.As the saying goes, ""To each his [her] own."" This one just wasn't for me."
4,great book,I enjoyed Annette's attitude and ability to live on despite her situation. The story was graphic and sad at times and what she endured unfortunately shapes the lives of many young ladies. The plot and characters kept me interested and am looking forward to reading more by Mary Monroe.
4,Good reading,I loved this book!! I usually only read memoirs but was interested in the book because of the title (it's one of my favorite sayings.) I was so into this book that I was thrilled to find out that it has a sequel. I really enjoy Mary Monroe's writing style. It's hard to put this book down...
3,3.5 Stars. This story is bizzare and disgusting!,"I'm pretty new to this author and her subject matter. I read the Upper Room. With GDLU, I thought it was disgusting of what Mr. Boatwright was doing to poor li'l ol Annette. But in the reality, this sort of stuff really happens. Kudos to the author for exposing this. However, on the other hand, her best friend, Rhoda the Rodent, was a demonic, evil creature. Her behavior was farfectched. It was a new and interesting story compared to the norm. The story was very predictable. It was obvious who was killing the people once we found out that it was Rhoda. I like the way this author writes and I think I'll read more of her work because her underlying message is to write to enlighten readers and not to just entertain them."
5,A TRUE PAGE TURNER!!!!!!,"...WHERE DO I BEGIN..THIS BOOK WILL MAKE U LAUGH,CRY,GET EXTREMELY ANGERY THROUGH OUT THE CHAPTERS! This book was GRRREAT!You will not be dissapointed, its hard to give a review without giving it away because I also have read the sequal!Enjoyed it as well!You will find yourself wanting to reach out and help Annette throught her life exsperiences-read and enjoy"
5,"Oh My Goodness, Oh My Goodness!","A Page turner. I couldn't put this book down. The friendship between Annette and Rhoda were unreal. She needed someone to stand up for her since her mother was too naive to notice one of her man friends was molesting her only child.Concerning Rhoda, I'm convinced that the lights were on, but nobody was home. She was fierce, killing people without a conscience. They should have just nicknamed her Murder Inc. There were so many twists and turns to this book, you'll just have to read it for yourself."
2,Ugly was this book,"I was truly disappointed in the is book. While a quick and easy read - the book lack the depth in describing some of the more important relationships.... I waited for the main character to truly come of age... and she did not... I know many women and many who have been assaulted and abused, they had more strength of character then the girl in this book and I find that this author has missed her mark by a mile. Research and character development should be this authors next move before writing again..."
2,Never Again,"Normally, when I find a literary treasure, I put it away in order to read it again at a later date. This book was placed on my list of books that I will never read again. I found it depressing, unrealistic and the trials of the heroine, downright unneccessary. I could not relate to the main character and did not want to. This was one of the few times that I could recall reading a book that I truly did not enjoy. I kept reading and waiting for the author to redeem herself and help me discover something that I liked about the book in the process. It never happened, so this book goes on my ""never again"" list."
4,Works fine in the office,I purchased this for my office. It works fine in that capacity. I haven't had any problems with spilling; maybe I'm just a bit more patient. The biggest problem I see is the warming plate. It keeps the coffee very hot- too hot! It will over cook what's left in the pot. Otherwise it's fine for me.
2,Not so great,"Initially, I liked this coffee maker well enough. The reuseable filter is a plus, and the coffee tastes good. But two characteristics make this one a loser:1. The coffee gets way too hot if it sits on the warmer longer than 20 minutes; and more importantly,2. The removable lever that allows the pause and serve feature to work is unreliable. It occasionally gets stuck and blocks the opening so that when brewing a new pot, all the water collects and stays in the basket (until you manually fix the lever). The thing easily pops off, and drives me CRAZY.I would not buy another DeLonghi coffeemaker."
4,"It's not perfect, but I liked it","""If the grind of the beans is too fine, the water backs up in the filter after the brew should be completed."" Yes, but I bet you can figure out how to solve this problem!I also agree that the carafe design allows too much spillage, but I figured out how to solve that the first time I used it. Just pour slower.As for the comment that the pause & stop lever is unreliable, I don't know. I have no trouble waiting the 3 minutes it takes to finish.The important feature is this: The coffee made with this and the Capresso conical burr grinder I use tastes great. Really great. The temperature is just right. No knobs, buttons, dials to figure out. Put in the beans, put in the water, hit switch. Very '50's, very effective.It would be nice if it shut off after an hour or so, but I can live with that too, for $20."
2,"Makes great coffee, if you can get to the basket.","Initially, I loved this coffee maker, it was so easy to use. After a few months of using it, I find the swing-open unit, that holds the grinds basket, gets stuck after you close it. It's nearly impossible to open it again. After I spent several minutes struggling with it, my husband said, ""Oh, I thought it was just me.""The coffee pours too fast out of the pot, something that took several times to get use to.It makes great coffee, but I would not buy this maker again."
2,Too Hot,"I would not recommend buying this coffee maker. Getting the water into the reservoir is a clumsy feat at best. But worse, when pouring the last third of the hot coffee out of the pot, the lid falls open allowing the steam to scald your knuckles. I wish I could have gotten another Krups 4-cup but they've stopped making them."
2,DON'T BUY THIS COFFEE MAKER!!!!!!!,"I purchased this coffee maker with birthday money and am extremely disappointed. The average coffee temperature is 160 degrees. This coffee maker ranged from 100-110 degrees, thus lacking the flavor, irregardlessof premium, freshly ground coffee. I contacted both the store where I purchased and the manufacturer and they had the nerve to tell me that's what you get for paying $20.00 for a coffee maker. I have usedMr.Coffee, coffee makers in the past with success, but this was on sale and I THOUGHT the Delonghi brand was a higher class since it is made by Cuisinart.OBVIOUSLY I WAS WRONG! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it does not take up alot of space and came with a insulated carafe."
2,Italian styling doesn't matter in the end,Previous reviewers were right: the plastic smell is intense and does not go away. Too bad.
5,Very Nice Funnels,"their soft and pliable, but firm enough to help keep them in their shape when your pouring stuff into them. They attract lint and dust like magnets, but clean up with a splash of water... Great for everyday funneling purposes."
3,Anatomy Coloring Book,"Great pictures and excellent for study, I just do not feel that i have gotten a whole lot out of it. It is a good study guide for Anatomy though."
2,colouring not for fun,"Not very amusing, but I guess that's not the point. Would have liked it better in a spiral/open-close bound since it's huge - little by little would have been more convenient and easy to carry around. Extensive and comprehensive."
1,ok not what i was hoping for,"ok well i got the book and was excited then i looked inside. i was not happy at all u can hardly see the text u really cant color because u cant tell anything apart it is very confusing. its not worth the money i wouldnt tell anyone to buy this product i am a RN student, i got this just to refresh my memory and i was lost"
2,Coloring Book,"The book is well aranged but did not work for me at all. The instructor makes no use of it. In her words, ""If you have time to doodle then use it."" I don't have time to doodle. For practical purposes it was waste of my money. Another text book piece of stuff for revenue.College Student"
3,It's ok,"I gave this book a 3 star rating because it is okay. There are sometimes too many areas in one page to color. But most of all, the author suggests to color muscles or bones a certain color that overlaps the next color. What I mean is that a blue maybe next to a deep purple, so it almost blends in too well. I ended up using a different color opposite of the color wheel to tell the two muscles or bones apart. Also, you have to color the description written in bubble-style font the same color as the anatomy part so you can easily reference the body sections."
3,Very advanced,"I bought this book to use in a community college level Anatomy and Physiology course and found that it was much more advanced than necessary for the difficulty level of the course I was taking. I've known medical school students to use the same book and found that, at least for my course, that it was way too detailed. I would definitely wait to buy the book until a few weeks into the class to see if it would be helpful. If it is appropriate for your course, then it is excellent because of the level of detail. I think it would be essential to passing an advanced Anatomy and Physiology course."
4,"Great for musculature, bones, and vessels, but lacks innervation","I'm currently taking Human Anatomy at Johns Hopkins Medical School, and this coloring book is a great study aid for processing the large amounts of information in an anatomy course. The book is pretty thorough on most subjects, but it is severely lacking in muscle and viscera innervation. The section on somatic and autonomic systems is a wonderful summary (and made sense out of my professor's lecture!) and has the major plexuses, but the book kinda fails when it comes to regional innervation - a major drawback when studying tightly packed areas like the pelvis and abdomen. Would have gotten a 5 star, but innervation is important to know and very tricky... maybe the authors can add some in a 4th edition?"
5,Anatomy Coloring Book.,"This book is my 'anatomy bible'. I use it daily as a rich source of information. It is well written, easy to understand and allows one to interact and therefore retain more in memory.I look at the pictures often because I have damages to my jaws and neck which are very disabling.My chiropractor owns a previous edition of this book.I highly recommend this book to anyone who has chronic pain and aches.[[ASIN:B0049P22SU Be Afraid of a Dentist, Be Afraid."
4,helpful,I got this book for my daughter for an extra credit in her high school ap anotomy class. She has found it to be very helpful and it has more information than her text book.
5,Helps alot :),this coloring book helps a lot! it makes it easier and clearer to learn anatomy if you find it a bit tough
4,good learning tool,I bought this book because I give massages and find it a very helpful guide in therapeutic massage. I refer to it all the time for more than massage-- understanding injuries and health conditions in general. A must for the curious.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0805350861/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
4,The anatomy coloring book (3rd edition),The information is good but the pictures could be a little bigger.
4,Great Book,"I love this book, very informative. I'm going to school to get my CA license and this book is really helping me with the anatomy, it's a bit overwelming to look at at first but it is a blessing to have...a great reference book too!"
4,A good guide,"This book was great for understanding and makes it more comprehensive to palpate the muscles when you give a massage. With so many layers of muscle, it is easy to distinguish each one. A very good guide."
3,study tool,"I took the Anatomy class and learning the muscles and body parts is the most important part and this is just a great study tool, great buy!!"
5,Book Review,Excellent book for any anatomy course at any level.Excellent transaction with seller. Prompt response from seller and product received quckly and wrapped safely.
5,Book review,This is a very good book for helping people that are visual learners like I am. Hope others find this as helpful as I have. Great illustrations.
5,Anatomy Coloring Book,This book is very detailed and looks like a lot of fun to work on. Binding and pages are clean and the book is absolutely brand new.
4,Coloring Book,Great book. Very thick. Can't wait to use it next semester when I start my class. It looks like a lot of work but I am sure it will help me with my studies. Quick delivery.
3,"Good, But There Are Some Inaccuracies","Good book overall. The book is organized in the exact same fashion as the Martini 6th Ed. Anatomy book.However, I've already noticed a few inaccuracies. One would be the picture of the Descending Tract. It shows the nerves that are coming down in the 20% branch, but then it shows them go off to the right side, instead of cross over (decussation) and pair back up with the nerves that are on the 80% side.Also the anterior picture of Dermatomes is incorrect in the L4-L5 area."
2,Meh,"I'm not impressed with this book. All the pictures are hand sketched and lots of them are very small. The size of the pictures makes it difficult to distinguish specific parts.I would describe the layout as messy and chaotic. The font used to name the anatomical parts is extremely annoying, it's done in hand drawn bubble letters and it makes the whole book seem like a middle school anatomy drawing project. The book comes across like someone's sketch book.I am in a college level anatomy class and I have seen several people in my class with much better anatomy coloring books I wish I had bought instead of this one."
3,"Adequate, but not the best.","This book will give you a great anatomy foundation, however I found it cluttered with too much information on each page. Some of the font is very small as are many illustrations. As others have pointed out, there are a handful of typos/misprints. Luckily they are all rather obvious, so they won't slip by you.I found The Human Body Coloring Book: The Ultimate Anatomy Study Guide to be far superior. Very palatable, clear and easy to read, and it breaks down the body by system (cardiovascular, lymphatic, nervous, etc.) making for fast memorization. Buy The Human Body instead!!!"
1,Terrible! Doesn't teach you anything! Confusing!,"What will this honestly teach you? I was expecting something to learn from! Sure its fun to color, but are you really learning. NO. and it was expensive not to learn. Broke college students should be warned!"
2,not what I needed,I think that would have been good for basic anatomy but for not sufficient for a masters level anatomy class. Pictures are a little small and the coloring would be quite tedious. If you have the time and dont need to know intricate details it might work.
4,Anatomy Got you Stumped?: Get THIS book!,"I typically learn by picking my favorite piece of something and learning the rest around that piece. Needless to say, it didn't work in anatomy memorization! There really isn't a favorite part of learning the nooks and crannies of anatomy and in most books, it all blends in. So, when I came across this lovely `A+' getter I was thrilled! It has detailed info and color ready pages on everything from cells to protuberances, diagrams and joints as well clear explanations. Just a certified HELP in an anatomy class, PERIOD!For any healthcare provider, it's always a great idea to brush up on client relation and reading the body and for this I recommend The Magic Touch: How to make $100,000 per year as a massage Therapist by Meagan R. Holub. This text is so reader friendly and really gets into client relations in chapters 3 and 4. Love it!"
4,Good Guide,This is a helpful tool for college anatomy and physiology students. it helps you understand and memorize what you need to know.
4,Great supplement for any anatomy course,"I am using this book as a study tool for my Gross Anatomy course. Anyone who has taken an anatomy class can tell you that color-coding structures is one of the most helpful ways to remember them. There are drawings of bones, muscles, joints, organ systems and explanations of virtually everything that could possibly be covered in an anatomy class. The drawings are excellent and most of the features of the bones are labelled as well. This was very helpful to me since I had to memorize virtually every tubercle, ridge, groove, or other protuberance on every bone of the body. When I had trouble with the skull because the drawings in my class notes were horrible, the drawings in this book were much clearer and helped out a lot. If you are taking an anatomy class, this is a smart and relatively inexpensive investment that will help you remember everything better."
5,Groosomly Wonderful,"Oh man, oh man. If you just love coloring and the disgusting inside of the human body, then this book is for you. Also good for children to learn the ins and outs of the human body."
5,exceptional for even elementary students,"I've used this book with students starting as young as 9 years old. We simplify for the younger ones, but it is an enjoyable and effective way to learn about anatomy. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow. I think this would be helpful for college students, too."
3,Overdone!,I like the book but way too much information on one page !! Nearly impossible to color in the very tiny areas!
5,A CD touch your heart,"""Sunset Island"", ""Teinsagu Nu Hana"", ""Heavenly Home"" are absolutely good pieces!I recommend this CD."
5,Excellent -- thanks!,"This book was delivered promptly and, actually, before the seller told me it would arrive. All in all, a great experience ordering from them. I'd highly recommend them. As for the book itself, my wife really enjoyed it (it was part of a first anniversary present), particularly because it includes some non-traditional love letters."
2,"Nice, but not great","Some of the letters are interesting, but mostly not that romantic. Definitely not the greatest letters ever, and some are not even letters at all. The formatting made it a little difficult to read. Overall it was okay, but not quite what I was hoping for based on the title."
2,Disappointed,"I'm pretty certain that these are not the 50 greatest love letters ever written. After reading it for about an hour total, I decided that I would prefer to gift a different book, ""98 Love Letters That Will Bring You to Your Knees"" to my beau. Some of these are platonic or familial love - of course there may be wonderful letters between friends and family - however, I would expect a collection of love letters to be those of romantic love."
4,Appreciation,This book gives you a really good understanding and overview of basic music. I would buy another book from the same author!
5,MUSIC,THIS WAS GREAT SERVICE AND THE BOOK WAS HALF OF THE BOOKSTORE PRICE. iT WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION.
4,The Lost 500 Years: What happened between the Old and New Testaments,Helps fill in some of the gaps in a nice way.
5,Cool album!,"If you're an R&B fan,you'll love this album! CAMELLIA and the #1 smash,SARA SMILE have been recycled for 2004's ULTIMATE DARYL HALL AND JOHN OATES. I once thought CAMELLIA was a Dan Hill recording,but I learned later that Hill's song is CARMELIA from 1987's DAN HILL. SARA SMILE is an ode to an ex-girlfriend of Daryl Hall's,Sara Allen. Daryl and Sara were living together at the time he wrote SS. Daryl told a similar story in the UDH&JO notes."
4,Great Music,This is a great album. This is the album where they found there sound. It hints at what's to come. I would recommend this album to anyone.
4,brazilian-ragga-rap-pop,"This band has conquered its place in the brazilian scene through a miscellaneous of reggae, rap, eletronic and rock , besides the band's social help. This is a good cd for those who wanna be in peace, go to a beach and just relax."
3,Sentenced - 'Amok' (Century Media) 3 1/2 stars,"'Amok' is the Scandinavian metal band's third effort.Their music had reportedly undergone some changes,because on 'Amok',they appear to be straight ahead rock&roll.Which,in this case is a good thing.Cuts like ""The War Ain't Over"",""Forever Lost"",""Dance On The Graves"" and ""Golden Stream"" show you what these guys are fully capable of.The playing and song arrangements are actually quite decent.Might appeal to fans of Hammerfall,Children Of Bodom,Nevermore and maybe Iced Earth."
1,If you use Window XP then Don't Purchase This Product,"This product will NOT work if you have Windows XP. First of all, you would have to give your child administrator rights to change your computer settings to use this product. Bad idea.Second, we can't even install the software even after approving the administrative rights. We get constant error messaages. The technical support site for this software is designed so that you cannot even submit your request unless you jump through about a million hoops.Save your money and the hassles that you will have trying to make this work on your computer."
1,Bad Software Alert !!!!,"Unfortunatley I bought this software before I read the reviews, and I absolutely agree with the other reviewers (elementary and middle school)that this software is awful, garbage, etc, etc. If you manage to work through the installation problems you will find the content utterly boring. This software has been returned."
3,Elementary Advantage,"Gee, I've used the Elementary and Middle School Advantage to suppliment the ""Play and Learn"" books for home schooling and found it acceptable. The programs can be difficult to load on newer machines but that is not our issue. Compared with what is being taught in public schools in our area, it is nice to have the opportunity to teach/learn Spanish, typing and do spelling in a game form. There are definetly things that could be improved on but as a suppliment its acceptable and usable. I particularly found the Middle School Advantage Reading disc full of books a great asset. The elementary spelling disc could use revamping by having grade graduated lists, common mis-spelled words and words grouped together with common sounds, spellings or letter characteristics. I recommend purchasing the set at the used price of under $10. and use it as a interactive suppliment."
1,Don't waste your time & money,We bought the Elementary Advantage 2007 - cannot even load it- we agree w/ the above. Amazon shouldn't even attempt to sell this product.
2,"Not helpful, not well organized.","The green guide has a lot of information on history of the churches - but very little on hotels and restaurants. While I might go to a church, I have to find a hotel.It's organized in alphabetical order, rather than by region. This means that areas that areas in the very far north might appear on an adjacent pages to a town on the US border. You need to know the place names in your area and skip through the entire book to find the areas relevant to your itinerary."
4,Now Legendary Album from an infamous band,"This album is a step away from the brutality of early mayhem, moving us into a land of fast tremolo picking and furious drums. This cd is extremely atmospheric, especially the now well known song ""Freezing Moon"". It is a very dark work of old school black metal.The few negatives I can think of for this album is slight repetativness, though for most its not an annoyance. The vocals of course are a huge debate, as Mayhem's vocalist dead died by his own hand before this album was recorded and so another voice was brought in. At times the vocals are very dark and evil, such as on freezing moon, while at others pitiful and almost humerous.I recommend this album for any fan of black metal who wants to delve into the genre's past."
5,Varg is definitely on this album,"This is a never to be repeated performance.Don't believe anyone that tells you Varg is notplaying bass on this CD - just compare the bass soundto early Burzum demos and you will notice that it isthe same style.Also, Snorre Ruche(Varg's accomplice in Euro's murder)wrote some of the music on this album."
5,Pure Norwegian Black Metal,"Before De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, Black Metal had no guidelines.Today, every band that says to play Black Metal, tries to imitate the sound and the atmosphere that De Mysteriis creates. Truly the birth of modern day Black Metal was paved by the brutal guitar riffs, the thundering and pounding of the hellhammers and the satanic shamanic vocals. Buy this album and own a piece of Black Metal history""EURONYMOUS"" R.I.P ""DEAD"" R.I.P"
1,This is NOT black metal,"I was expecting someting along the lines of Bad Brains or Living Colour, but instead I got a bunch of white boy clowns singing about the Devil. I may have to get some of my homeys down here so we can kick their lily butts."
1,black metal is crap...,The worse form of metal to me is thrash and blackmetal only bands that passes as af as thrash is carnal forge and the haunted and blackmetal well...None! Mayhem 's sound is dumb and pointless just like the rest of its peers and surely it gets realy old so don't bother.Black metal sucks period! Even emperor blows.
2,Amazingly overrated,"Supposedly this is Mayhem's best album. At least that's what one guy told me. Anyway, I really like the singer's weird voice. It sounds very evil. Most of the music is incredibly amateurish. It sounds like it took incredibly little skill to have created. The music lacks much complexity. The drums are about 85% blast beats. I gave it greater than 1 star because I really like the singer and a few seconds here and there sound good. I also really like the cover art and the images of the band members in the sleeve."
1,what's the big deal,"i bought this album, hoping it would live up to the hype. well if you are impressed by drums and lightning fast songs, i guess you'll like it. i mean all you hear is the drums, the guitars are horrible, the guy can't sing, and the recording is horrible. i don't see the big deal, i think it's because they were one of the first bands to do it. if they came out now, no one would care. people say dimmu borgir betray black metal, oh no, a band with talent, that's not black metal. but no one says mayhem did, but helhammer is in kovenant, with who else but members of, dare i say dimmu borgir. look at the new album anyway, it's almost as bad as this one. all it is is a bunch of guys, (one who looks like snoop doggy dogg) ranting on and on about satan. they are no different than chrisrian groups that rant on and on about god."
4,pain of death,"As many of the other reviewers have mentioned, this is a groundbreaking/genre defining recording that contains some of the corpse-rippingest songs ever penned. ""Funeral Fog"" and ""Pagan Fears"" defy comparison in all but the blackest realms of metal. When the former blasts out of your speakers you will want to eat your own skin. Attila's vocals are simply inhuman - amazing. The grinding snarl of Euronymous' guitar will melt your eyes. Hellhammer is certainly remarkable, but tends to rely too heavily on strikingly similar tom-tom rolls - which lose their dramatic effect through overuse. Nevertheless, the controlled frenzy of his approach, lends his playing a jazzy quality that begs comparison with the apocalyptic drumming of Elvin Jones (and, indeed, the haunting chaos of black metal was strangely anticipated by the later work of John Coltrane)."
5,They Prove Songs About Our Loving Saviour DO Work!,"This is by far the best gospel band I have evar heard! They are not afraid to show their true faith! They sing songs about how much love our lord gives us and how we can get through troubled times by trusting our lord and loving each other. I'm so happy to see that they even don two crosses on their band name just to show even more their love for Christ!Songs about love, God, and our faith show that Christianity is not dead in music. And with His power it shall only grow larger.Some other wonderful Christian gospel bands worth listening to are: Emperor, Mercyful Fate, Marduk, Mortiis, Rotting Christ, and Satanica (who show how evil and bad our Dark Lord is). Merry listening fellow god lovers!"
5,de mysteriis dom sathanas one hell of cd!,Any one in to black metal! Well love this cd uttila and euronymous are killer!
5,one of the greatest,"even if euronymous was a worthless, spineless parasite who got what he deserved he could sure play a mean guitar. the cold distortion and broad sweeping disonent riffs are like a labyrinth. the non stop blasting and bone shaking fills are the drums of murderous ritual. the bass.. yeah well... when audible it adds a very eerie harmoney to it all. and the vocals... NO ONE has since or ever will capture the feeling of black metal like attila has on this album. ""but he's not screaming like everyone else"" gimmie a break. the sheer POWER of his voice sends chills down my spine every time i hear it. this was the first black metal album i ever bought and after all these years it still sounds as fresh as it did back then."
3,i heart transylvania,"the music and atmosphere on this thing is very cool/cold/bleak/spooky/raw/snowy... however, i really think the vocals are very dumpy & hacked. i like the review the one guy on here wrote that ""the vocals sound like a homeless stoned bum kicking a can and making fun of black metal singers"". after hearing a demo/studio version of ""freezing moon"" w/ dead on vocals (off the nordic metal tribute cd) i have realized that if he hadn't killed himself & went through w/ doing the vocals on this record, it would've been one of the greatest black metal albums of all time. period. i'll settle for my burzum albums instead of this. burzum is the greatest black metal force ever."
5,Blue Print for Norwegian Black Metal,Fantastic black metal in its primal state. The vocals are unearthly and mesmerizing. The music is magical and revolutionary. Every song is memorable and well written. This is the classic Mayhem with Euronymous and Count Grishnach (aka Varg Vikernes).
5,absolutely essential!!!!!,"This album is legendary for more reasons than the murders. The music itself helped define an entire new wave of metal and is still fresh and unsurpassed today. Not a bad track on this one, but all of the elements fit so well together that it's hard not to get drawn in and ""quartered"" in the process. Attila does a great job as usual on vocals which works for creating the eerie atmosphere; Euronymous does worthy guitar work, especially for a raw black metal album, and of course Hellhammer is considered one of the best metal drummers period. I haven't found anything about this that I don't like, in fact it's one of the albums that I gladly shove down other peoples throats when I introduce them to this stuff. I absolutely love actual black metal, and most things that are dark, misanthropic, angry, depressing, hate mongoring,etc. they have a genuine and beautfiful quality about them (think H.R. Geiger's art put to music) so this fits in well with me.Hails!!!!"
5,Cod-Satanic homosexual opera? I'll show you....,"How anybody who claims to like black metal could give this album one star is beyond me. Mayhem is black metal. There would be no black metal as we know it without this album. Trust me. This absolutely stunning. Even with all the hype that surrounds this album, my expectations were completely blown away when I heard it. This is better than you could ever imagine. But know this, if you don't like black metal, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM! This is pure crushing black metal, and if that turns you off you won't like it. But if you do, or you think you do, you'd best buy this album. You WILL be blown away."
3,i think the album title means glorious morning (mourning) of satan or something like that.,"first off, this is the best mayhem album ever composed-HAND'S DOWN.the only down side is the vocals (to a point). i wonder if the group went and picked up attila from a port pub before he shipped off because they sound like they have a drunk pop-eye singing for this album, and i crack up.--no disrespect to attila because he did great work in tormentor-but it's true.but then something funny happens, the singer grows on you and when compared to listening to the songs with dead on them and attila, the attila versions are far superior.i know euronymous had many plans for this album and he would of succeeded much further had he lived longer, oh well it's a great album none the less."
5,Let me say one thing,"This is one of the greatest albums ever recorded, in any genre, by any artist. A true masterpiece of pure, searing evil."
2,boring,"in my eyes mayhem are way over rated. their riffs get boring and albums sound the same. there is plenty of better black metal available, bands that dont repeat the same 4 chords and dont think that unorganized vocals is art."
2,Crappy transfer,"As mentioned by other reviewers, the picture quality of these releases is below par. It looks like they were mastered from old fullscreen VHS tapes - picture is grainy and dull, colors aren't sharp. Plus ""Prom Night 3: The Last Kiss"" is the tamer edited-for-television version.I wish I could get a refund. Steer clear of this release."
4,2 fun movies for a late night weekend watch,"Prom night 3 (1989)Was in fact rather fun, comedic and shall I dare say, semi creepy? It wasn't like part 1, or even 2, but it was still decent, while the 1991 'finale' deliver us from evil takes us into a very similar direction as the cheap yet scary 'HALLOWEEN: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS' Director's cut...but that one at least has pace. I actually thought they were both decent, especially part 3, the transfer on part 3 was pretty good, fullscreen, but it looked sharper then the VHS, yet part 4, not so much...it looked the same as a VHS except less speckling and no backround film sound (like old vhs's have)I liked the fact that it was realy cheap and it's 2 movies for 1 low price, part 3 was about mary lou like part 2, except this one takes a dark humor route, part 4 had some semi suspense in it but was pretty cheap. Overall quality isn't that spectacular, but admit it, neither were these sequels..."
5,No Better Place to Start,"On the one hand, the text of the Summa can be hard for beginners, even smart ones. On the other hand, textbooks where people tell you what other people thought suck. So Kreeft gives you the main dish, the text of the Summa itself (trimmed of some extraneous material not relevant to beginners (stop complaining specialists and fanatics!)), but with his lucid notes at the bottom of the page along with helpful illustrations. The book also sports a handy glossary. So go ahead, don't be afraid, read Aquinas, but don't be afraid to buy this book and have Kreeft along as a guide."
5,Kreeft tackles a tough job,Prof. Kreeft does a masterful job taking a very difficult subject and reducing it into manageable pieces. The Angelic Doctor can be a bit daunting when approached directly; this book gives a helpful mix of direct quotes and clear commentary. It reminded me of a college course given by a great teacher
5,Awesome!,This book is exactly what I was looking for. I'm a college freshman and one of my classes is going through St. Thomas' Summa and this book is great at explaining important details.
2,Aquinas For Dummies,"This book is good if you are new to studying Aquinas, but considering in the inreoduction Kreft suggest not skipping the objections and reading the ""on the contrary"" and the ""I answer that"" first, he certainly edits many of the articles this way. It is my opinion that Kreeft cut out too much text."
4,Antenna Engineer,"Good book. It really goes into detail. The MATLAB code does not work due to missing functions ""unitr"" and ""crossr""."
1,The virginian,"This was not what I expected. I thought since it was a DVD that it would be old episodes of the The Virginian. It was not, it was actually a book that you read on the TV. Who needs that. I was very disappointed and when I finally watched it it was too late to return."
5,this is the only way to take the bikes home,"After have the privilege to view this marvelous display that the Guggenheim has put together you want to go back again & again to go over details you may have missed. Since this is not always possible why not have the next best thing. The photos alone are worth the price of the book especially as you can NOT take any pictures while viewing the bikes in their museum setting. Not all of them were on display in Chicago so for us it is the only way to see the ones that weren't there. But not only that to be able to go back & say remember that one, you know the one with the wooden wheels, the one that guy rode laying down on his stomach in a swimsuit, the Brittan....Thank you Thomas & crew for an excellent job."
5,Black Mamba!,"I saw this on animal planet. it was excellent! it showed what a black mamba looks like, what it does, what it eats, how it attacks, what it attacks, and the signs to look out for. one line in the movie said ""two drops of black mamba venom can kill a person"". I thought that was really helpful. It also showed, examples of black mamba attacks, some that don't end too happily, but most do in the video. a must see if you are interested in snakes, african wildlife/biology, and conservation of animals. DO NOT MISS!!"
5,gift for mother-in-law,"i bought these for my mother-in-law. she loved them! they are light and delicate and go with everything. she doesn't wear a lot of jewelry, and within a week of receiving them, she had already worn them 3 times before her actual birthday. great buy."
4,Martin Denny,"This album is classic Martin Denny. I particular enjoy all the ""Quiet Village"" sounds. This is a one of a kind album."
4,Grows on you.,"I was infected by Enchanted Sea in the sixth grade 1972 (blame my parents).It sounds corny today, but it's nostalgic for me. Just pretend you're ""back in the day"".When I play it my kids grab their stuffed toys and bird puppets,then whenever they hear some tropical critter in the background they squeeze their toys on cue as if they were people in the band ""playing"" the exotic sounds ""live"" using real animals."
1,Not Even Close to Original,"This music may be Martin Denney but IS NOT the original Ouiet Village, I have the Original Album and the case it came in, over half the sound tracks are different, and the ones I wanted are not on it. NEVER AGAIN. Capt. Karl A Greig"
2,Did We All Read The Same Book?,Definately not one of Buffa's best. It appeared not even the author knew which direction he was headed midway thru the novel. Poor characterization and a cheap ending.
2,Not that great....don't know what the other reviewers were reading!!!!,"I am currently in the middle of the book and let me tell you it's a struggle. I think Buffa can write; the problem is that he wants to tell you EVERY detail of every character, past, present and future! This slows the book down to a crawl and you end up with 30% to 40% of the book being irrelevant. The characters are interesting but when you read 10 pages that should have been a paragraph and 20 pages at a clip that add nothing to the story, it kills the book. If the editor of the book would have done his job and shrunk the book to 250- 300 pages of story instead of 480 pages of minutia this would be a best seller 4 stars!!!!! As for the other reviews, I don't know what book they were reading!!!!!"
3,not buffa's best,"while i loved the first two books in the series, this one was only so so.... instead of admiring Joesph like I did in the first two books, in this one he comes off as a jerk. The court room scenes were very good and the basic story excellent but everytime I would get hooked into the story all of a sudden we meandered into a sub plot that just was annoying. A good story minus about 100 pages, Jennifer, and the ending which was just plain stupid...."
2,WARNING! Bad writing ahead...,"I was in the mood for a light bit of suspense fiction... nothing brilliant, but a good airport read. Seeing all the positive reviews this book had gotten, I figured I'd give it a try. WOW... what a mistake! Buffa spends the first 70 pages setting up back-story. The writing is so bad that it's actually funny at times. I read passages aloud to my friends to show them just how bad it was. Now, maybe it evolved into something remarkable in the second half, because I only made it halfway through before deciding that life is too short to spend on something this bad. But I'll tell you this.. although I don't think Grisham is a ""great"" writer, per se, at least he knows how to keep things moving along and his dialogue (isn't bad). Grisham is entertaining, in a 'light' kind of way. Buffa, however, is not."
3,so so,"FLAW? Why didn't Joseph Antonelli stop them from committing Elliott Winston to an insane asylum when he was charged with Antonelli's attempted murder? Wasn't he called as a witness? Didn't he have any say so as to whether Winston would be charged or not? Couldn't he have refused to press charges? Or am I wrong?Why didn't he do anything to help his good friend Winston? I mean Antonelli hired Winston cuz he thought he was the best young lawyer going and as the years go by comes to really like this kid. Yet stands by and does nothing when Winston needs him. He doesn't even visit him in the asylum for 12 yrs. Doesn't make any sense to me. What kind of a friend is that? Doesn't make the character of Antonelli very appealing.I've read a couple of Buffas's Joseph Antonelli books and have yet to really feel/know any of the characters. For such a successful lawyer he doesn't seem to have his act together, do any serious investigating etc. . He just seems to stumble onto information."
3,Ruined by Romance,"The underlying legal story in this book was fairly compelling and interesting. But the story was sidelined by the romance, which I found intrusive and wholly unnecessary. Too bad. I may try another of Mr. Buffa's books, but I don't feel compelled to do so any time soon."
4,"Probably should be 3 1-2 stars, but ...","For all its flaws, the book holds your attention. Buffa nicely weaves past and present, even though the protagonists narration of the past is not like anyone would talk.Still, a reasonably intelligent court-thriller, with an interesting last paragraph. A nice summer read, but probably for next summer _ save your $$$ for the paperback.In summary: there's a lot worse out there in this genre."
3,The first music video musical,"Julien Temple had lots of experience making music video's before he made this film, and it shows. Basically, it is many music video's strung together to formulate a film, which is not such a good idea. The story needed much more dialogue and character definition. You'll watch the film and think it looks really neat, but you won't care for the characters. A few months after this film was released, Spike Lee had a hit with something called ""Do the right thing"". Spike's film is almost a copy of this, same plotline, same issues, but no music. Both films cover a hot summer heatwave where peoples tempers are on edge, race riots occur, etc etc. Why Spike got more attention, I'm not quite sure."
4,JULIEN TEMPLE'S OVERLOOKED MASTERPIECE,"With the likes of Moulin Rouge making an impact in the current film scene, one can't help but look back to another lavish attempt at the musical in the 80s - Julien Temple's overlooked ""Absolute Beginners.""I watched this in glorious 70 mm and like watching Baz Lurhmann's Moulin Rouge - this was a visual tour-de-force.The critics didn't like it however, which was a shame. Forget the plot, and the story, but enjoy the ride. That's what it's all about. This was a really inventive and slick piece of work. Heck, Julien's other (& lesser) music video work like ""Blue Jean"" with David Bowie got more attention, and I wonder why.Well worth watching but as someone puts it below, it really should be letterboxed and on DVD. Video just doesn't do the scale of the vision much justice at all. Or perhaps we will see a re-release someday in the theatres. But that's wishful thinking..."
4,Interesting Film,"There's a movie musical somewhere in David Bowie's talent, but I'm not sure this is it. Don't be deceived by the cover, David's only a minor bit in this.The sets and lights are spectacular here, and the music's pretty good. I like the Sade song. Some of the British accent's a bit hard to catch, (I turned on the captions for the ""Ted's not Dead"" song)Disappointing extras, and not even a copy of the film's preview. I'm never really partial to slide shows of promotional photos.I think this film just came out at a time when musicals weren't popular. It probably would have fared better if released today. I'm sure some Broadway producer will be ... over it soon, given their proclivity to turn movies and TV shows into Broadway musicals."
3,A well-aged piece of cheese,"I loved this movie when it first came out, and it was worth the wait to see it all again. Even for a ""period piece"", a staged musical, and a product of the 80s, it remains a great deal of lightweight fun, even if David Bowie doesn't get nearly as much screen time as any fan might have wanted :)"
3,Great movie; DVD not so great.,"One of the things I loved about this movie was the set design and costumes, all in spectacular colors. However, the color in this MGM-released DVD wobbles from vivid to washed-out and back to vivid, often during the same scene. Pretty disappointing -- what I might expect from a 2nd-generation VHS copy, but not a DVD."
4,I absolutely love it!,I just can't understand the poor reviews and ratings for this movie but I guess its box office performance is this most accurate rating of all. I love this movie for its 80's attempt at portraying 50's West London. As I am originally from West London I found this a great nostalgia trip. The two leading characters are not very well played but Patsy Kemsit looks as wonderful as ever. The musical numbers are great - especially the Ray Davies piece and the Selling Out routine. Julian Temples' background in video is obvious throughout the movie and makes for some very original and striking images. Lastly the small parts played by Alan Freeman and Lionel Blair are just wonderful.
5,Gone Too Soon,"My daughter turned me on to Chocolate Starfish (and the Badloves and Cruel Sea) when I visited her in Australia in 1994. This is a great album, full of life with strong vocals and instruments, especially percussion. Nothing fancy or ""concept"" -- just great straightforward rock 'n' roll -- sort of like the Aussies themselves. ""Mountain"" is my favorite track. Their second album (""Box"") is even better. Danielson Darren and Romich Zoran also appear as part of the band Brill on the album of the same name (1997). I'm glad I got these CDs when I did!"
3,"Should have been titled ""Supremacy of Johnathan Edwards""","This is an inspiring review of a powerful and gifted preacher - Johnathan Edwards. While very interesting, the title led me to expect a broader inspiration of the supremacy of GOD in preaching, not a focus on Edwards.An interesting biography of someone who has inspired John Piper, but unless you are also inspired by Edwards, this may not be the book for you."
2,Could have been titled,"Obviously, Piper loves Jonathan Edwards. The book started out well enough, but the second half seemed an idolization of Edwards. My thinking is that we have much better role models in Christ and the apostles, and to put such an emphasis on the work of Edwards is disconcerting.Edwards himself was in awe of the unfathomable work of God work during the Great Awakening, and probably would have attributed much less of its effects to himself than Piper does.As is evident in the title, Piper is beating his ""supremacy"" drum again, so if you're not really enthusiastic about Calvinist theology, you might find this book to be a bit difficult to enjoy."
3,"Good, but could be better....","I appreciate what Piper is doing here. By using Edwards as a guide to a theology of preaching, how could he go wrong? Yet the more I read, the more he left me wanting. Maybe that was his aim, but as an introduction to the thought, purpose, and goal of preaching, it just gets started and then is over. The outline of the book makes sense, each chapter being a coherent whole, but they felt more like an introduction than a true tratment. It was enough to get me interested, but not enough to leave me satisfied. This book is good at provoking questions, but not very good at answering them, at least for me. A quick read, he is engaging as a writer."
1,I'm utterly speechless,"This has to be the most uninspired, uncreative bio pic I've ever seen. It's basically one long interpretive dance punctuated by actors pretending to be people interviewing about Nureyev. The acting is over-played, the dancing is under-skilled, and the choreography is a disaster. 47 minutes was too long."
3,ok for the price,"They are pretty good for the price, the block is really cheap but I guess so was the price. yay"
2,Lead Belly Lite,"This CD is sort of OK. It has some of the songs that Lead Belly is known for (i.e., ""Goodnight Irene,"" ""House of the Rising Sun""), but they aren't portrayed in a manner that says ""Yes! This is a blues artist that could have inspired generations of folk, blues, and rock artists!""It's sort of 12-string guitar thing, folky and strummy, and it lacks the guts that you expect in a good blues recording. But, hey, Lead Belly played 12-string guitar, you say? Darn right, and he played it better on ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night"" (Smithsonian Folkways), for example.The recording quality here is pretty good. There's some noise, but it's better than you might expect of recordings from this era. It's the performance that suffers. Lead Belly's material is timeless, but the renditions that we have here fall short of sounding inspiring. Great artist. Check elsewhere for his great stuff."
1,Absolutely disappointing,"Lead Belly wrote over one hundred songs and yet only a scant 15 are collected here over only 46 minutes. The collection bores us with 2 versions of John Hardy and misses the most famous Lead Belly song of all, Cotton Fields, a song almost every child knows."
1,Shilling books for Len,Cheanne Chellis fails to mention that she some how connected to the Author's business and is his wife. All her other book reviews give glowing recommendations for Len's books. I find Len's writings amateurist at best.
4,Great for what it is,"My Son loves Dora and Diego. Now that it is downloaded, I can take it anywhere instead of relying on wifi to stream on my Kindle Fire."
5,Diego's Awesome!,My son just LOVES both Diego & Dora...I like them cuz they are educational & my son is also learning another language when he watches these shows!
5,Great kids show,My son loved watchin it with so many episodes its great. These is great for the kids and having it on xbox is awesome
3,"Good guitar, great voice, so so material","I bought this cd for the song, My Soul's in Louisiana. None of the others quite measured up. On the bright side, though, this one song was worth the price of the whole cd."
5,A homely journey through the Rosary with Mary,"This book enables you to speak to Mary as what the author mentions to be ""kitchen-room"" chats.You get to see the Mysteries of the Rosary as more than mere words....they become epoch-making events in the life of the woman caled Mary.How life for her changed when she was first announced by the Angel Gabriel to be the Mother of God,how life changed when Jesus began his public ministry.....all these become actual events in a flesh-and-blood person's life.A must-read for people who want to get in touch with the ACTUAL Mary-----the human Mary.The Mary who was a common woman with an uncommon faith.Compelling and touching reading."
4,Secured,"This is a pretty good buy. Yes the foam in mine smelled horrible but, a washing in some mild laundry detergent and hanging out to dry fixed that.I use this to secure my weapon in my nightstand as well as in my vehicle and camper. Only wished I had checked Cabela's first, could have saved a few dollars as shipping for this was expensive."
3,Needs a little more height but is ok with compression to lock it up.,"With compression of the lid and inner foam over a full size 9 mm and even compact 9 mm handguns one can close and lock the box, but that and the cable arrangement can cause some gap around the front edges. For the price it seems an ok delaying device to prevent someone easily stealing after breaking into a car."
5,Hand Gun Case,This product is fantastic. It has a great locking system and it is extremely tough. The perfect case for airline travel with a hand gun for your checked luggage.
4,A must for gunowners,"I purchased this item in order to secure my handgun in my car during the day while I am at work. Company policy will not allow me to carry on site even with a license. Once I was able to get rid of the chemical smell of the foam interior, this thing has been great. Eventually, I will put one in our other car. It will not, of course, deter a determined thief with time on his hands, but for most car break-ins it should work fine."
4,Review,"It is well made and very portable. I would buy it again.The only down side I've seen is that the paint it was made with has a strong odor that hasn't gone away, and the lock needed tightened once. Neither of these are deal breakers. I got this to keep my guns away from my kids and it does the job great."
3,"Low cost, decent product.","First off I received this product today and had to go put it down in the basement. IT STINKS!!!! The foam smells like chemicals or something.I had to change around the latch that locks the safe in place, poor quality as it is bent...The product works as described. It will definitely be great to have this in my car.3/5."
3,Secure-It problem,"I had a problem with my first safe--after a short while, maybe 2 weeks, the lid did not close tightly. The company gave me a refund and sent me a shipping label. I decided to try another safe. When it arrived, I compared the first with the second and found that there was a piece on the new lock post that kept everything secure. It fell out in a few hours, but I was able to find it. It was a small ""C"" clip. I reinserted it, and now the new safe is fine. Owners of the safe need to watch out for a problem until the manufacturer fixes it. Otherwise, the safe is fine."
4,"Meets my needs, reasonably priced","I rarely need to secure a hand gun while traveling, and this unit meets my needs. It is simple, easy to use, reasonably priced and meets TSA airline requirements. Keeps the weapon secure. Just as described by the vendor. Sure you can pay more, but why?"
4,Great inexpensive place to store a firearm,"Its not a secure safe by my standards, more of a great metal lock box. Great place to put my concealed carry while i'm in places my permit doesn't allow me to carry.Pros:Easily fits under my seat in my truck and car.Easy to move from one vehicle to the next.Easy to cover with something to keep it out of site.Cons:Someone with intent could cut the thin cable and take it quickly with small pliers.Looks like it could be pried openOverall its a great product if you want a locked metal case to store valuables to deter someone who breaks into your vehicle without pliers or equivalent cutting device."
4,Great small secure case for travel or general purpose,"Constructed of steel with a matte black finish, this case complies with TSA requirements for traveling with a firearm. It also functions well when traveling across state lines that are not gun friendly. There is foam padding that keeps the gun secure and from sliding around.I have tried this case with a full sized Para Ordnance P-14, 45 ACP, Glock 23 (40 Caliber S&W;), Glock 27 (40 Caliber S&W;), a Ruger SP-101 2.25"" 357 Magnum and a Ruger GP-100. The full sized guns fit in a diagnonal configuration. The accompanying coated cable keeps the secured case in place. Useful applications with the cable include securing your case to a night stand, under the car seat or even in your closet. 2 keys are supplied with the case.Not only would this serve as a great storage safe for pistols but is helpful with traveling and a soft deterrent is desired to secure certain items.For the price and the wide applications, I recommend considering this type of case."
4,"Only one ""stinking"" problem","I would have given this one 5 Stars except for one thing. The dang thing smells something awful when it's open. The ""memory"" foam, which by the way has no memory at all, just plain smells. It's hard to explain, it's a cross between animal pee and moth balls. I've tried soaking the foam in soapy water, using Fabreeze and leaving the pieces out in the sun. No dice. If the box last as long as the smell does, I'll have it for a long time. I eventually replac the foam and moved on.That being said, the unit itself is sturdy and well built. Very good deal and decent price. Shipping was a bit high. You can find it in many gun shops for cheaper without the shipping. So if you are not in a hurry and frequent a range or gun shop, they will probably have it for less."
4,Great for the Price,To a trip with this product work as advertised. Does stink but gun and magazine fit perfect XD40sc .
5,No Frills Security,"There is no ""one"" solution to securing a handgun with the exception of a vault, but this little box makes me feel a little better when I need to leave my pistol in my vehicle. It provides safe, secure storage and is not too big or too small. And the ""Secure-It Handgun Storage Safe"" is very well made with a professional finish and top quality securing cable. You'd play hell ripping one of these things from an automotive seat rail, and even if you did it might take some work to open the safe. This is also an excellent place to store your registration too."
1,Buyer Beware JUNK!!,"Upon receipt of item I opened the box to get the keys, I tested the key cylinder then shut and locked the box. That was the last time I saw the inside of the box. I tried using pliers to turn the key, as well as manipulating the box lid to try and free the latch. I sent the box back bent key and all for a full refund. I guess it's better that it failed upon initial inspection rather than during an emergency situation."
1,over priced tin can,"I got this as a Birthday gift last week. Right out of the box this over priced tin can came apart! It is made out of the cheapest, thinest ""metal"" and all held together by two cheap spot welds! you could easily pry it open with a small screwdriver. I am VERY surprised Amazon and Sprotsmans guide would sell such worthless JUNK! I would have given it NO STARS if amazon would let me."
2,Couldn't get them keyed alike,"I was interested in buying several of these all keyed alike, so I called the customer service number for Sportsman's Guide to see how to order these. ""Glen"" told me it wasn't possible.Sorry Glen, I'll be ordering these from another vendor who can manage this order."
1,secure it junk,I would easily be able to rip this box open. I refuse to put a 600 dollar hand gun in a piece of garbage like this. Any criminal with a little hand strength could easily get into this box quickly.
4,Heavy but Strong,"The safe is built very well and will protect my firearm during travel which was my reason for buying it. The only complaint I have is that it is a little heavy. With the cost of baggage going up with airlines, you may want to look into the weight of this item before purchasing it if you intend to travel with it."
1,Tiny,A very small case - I don't think any remotely reasonable sized revolver will fir in this case. Time to ship it back....
3,For those who wish this safe had a combination lock...,"I purchased this safe from Center-of-mass.com but mine is the three dial combination version. Nice box for the price but if you are looking for quick access... FORGET IT! The dials do not index (automatically center) on the desired combination like most locks of this type do. Essentially the combination can be set BETWEEN numbers or just slightly off center. This causes a problem opening the lock quickly because the dials must be set EXACTLY where they were when the combination was set. If one or two of the dials is just a little-off you can't open the box. I have had to ""fiddle"" with mine EVERY time to get it open. It works ... but could MUCH be better. I guess I'll just have to spend four times as much for a safe with a Simplex push-button lock."
5,My Favorite Band,"All I have to say is that 3 is one of the best bands I have ever heard, and I love music. They are amazing, everything about them is beautiful. The guitar work is outstanding and the songs are perfect. If you have heard them you know what I'm talking about. And if you have not, then I can not stress enough the importance of getting this CD. GET IT! You will love it as I do. I can't get enough of them, I have all of there CD's, and they are all amazing."
4,Just Ja...,"Ja Rule is a very talented rapper. To be honest, this cd has a lot of anger in it, but is a pick-you-upper on a bad day. The best tracks are Put it on Me and Cry."
3,Yo Ja you could do better than this.,"Yo what's up Ja, this album is all right but it ain't better than vvv.the song between you and me is the bomb i swear thats the best song ever thats the best song you ever made."
1,THE WORST KNOCK OF ARTIST OUT THERE!!!,"Thank God I didn't actually buy this album. I received this as a b-day gift and I have to say that it is the worst attempt at originality that I have ever heard. Not only does JA try and sound like PAC, I think he actuall thiks he is the man reincarnated. JA, you're forgeting one thig....TALENT. The entire album is filled with immature and naive rhymes that leave the listener feeling like it was written by pre-pubesent little kid. JA is smart enough to know that he can't carry an entire album himself and brought along a slew of R&B artists to add some depth. The finished product leaves much to be desired. Do yourself a favor and go buy an album by a real artist!"
3,not quite vvv,This cd wasn't as good as venni vetti vicci because it is not as original as his first one. Ja rule has a few songs on this talking about love. But I know that people from the streets dont really care to here about love as much as something that hits to close to home. This album is worth the money but is not as good as vvv or the murders cd.
