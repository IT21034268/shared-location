2,Bad adhesive - fell off in a day,I purchased these stickers to put on a new bike. Within a day the stickers were peeling away and falling off the bike. I supposed it's possible I received a bad set but nonetheless felt a review was appropriate. The seller gave excellent customer service and refunded my money.
5,Cool stickers for bike or skateboard helmets.,"Bought these stickers for my kids to personalize their new bicycle helmets. They were great, easy to use and stuck well. Great price and value for your money. I recommend them to all! Cool stickers for bike or skateboard helmets."
5,One of the best Kathy Smith workouts,"I've used this DVD consistently for the past couple of years and it is always a good workout. If anything, sometimes I frankly don't want to work so darned hard so I don't use it as much as I should. But it is very good in terms of getting your heart pumping, challenging step moves and weight lifting."
2,"Kathy's videos usually good, but this one...","I love step, and love Kathy Smith, but this is by far, one of the most annoying videos I have from her. You'll definitely be sweating, but there's overall too much extra coordination required for this video (and I'm apparently normally coordinated). You're literally going around and around your step in weird ways that are not necessary at some points. And not easy to figure out when your back is to your tv. And I would definitely not recommend this for anyone with problem knees/ankles. Although the intensity is not a problem, the moves are. The woman on the left (who seems to be competing for air time) choreographed the 2nd segment, which explains Kathy's prompting problems there. The first segment is somewhat better.Overall, get another step video by Kathy Smith. Not this one, unless you're looking for a new cheerleading routine."
5,Fat Burning DVD review,This is a great DVD for intermediate to advancedpeople who exercise. It has both cardio andstrength training and can do it all in 30 minutes.And get a great workout
5,Definately a Fat Burner DVD,"I have used the Walk Away the Pounds DVD's but I was not getting enough of a work out.I used to do the Kathy Smith Time Saver Cardio, which I loved, but it was on VHS and I never bought it on DVD. I decided to get the Fat Burner cardio and it worked me as hard as the Time Saver and the weights add a little more variety. This is great for anyone no matter what fitness level you're at.The only struggle for me is that I am not very coordinated, but I always found a way to keep up."
4,I love to hate this video,"I have a love/hate relationship with this video. It's challenging, demanding and usually while doing it, I can't wait to be done. Once I'm done though, I find that I feel invigorated and that I've worked my whole body. I keep coming back to this tape because it's been so effective."
4,"A Challenging, Fresh Workout","I really like this video. The cardio intervals are a great fat burner and the upper body weight sections are fairly comprehensive. My only complaint is that Kathy sometimes seems confused, so there is a lot of voice-over instruction, and what ""live"" instruction there is is sometimes miscued, which is annoying. Otherwise, Kathy is a really engaging instructor. Good tape."
2,BETTER BE FAST ON YOUR FEET!!!,"I have been running regularly for the past 6 months, so with winter here, I thought I could use a good cardio workout. I already own ULTIMATE PILATES and LIFT WEIGHTS TO LOSE WEIGHT 2 from Kathy Smith and I truely enjoy them. As for FAT BURNING BEAKTHROUGH, my mistake was not reading all the reviews before purchasing it.I agree with customers who said the step routine was very complicated. I have tried it many times, and still miss quite a few steps. There comes a point where I just can't follow anymore, and my heart rate goes down. The camera angles make it difficult sometimes to see the leg work, and those who don't have a step at home will not always see the lady on the right of their screen who is the only one without a step.I do like the weight lifting and ab section though, which I combine with other workouts or pop in after a run.I would love to find a good and relatively simple cardio workout either from Kathy Smith or another fitness expert. Any suggestions?"
5,Good for those who want a challenge!,"This workout is up there with the Weight Loss Workout because it really makes you sweat and is A FAT BURNING BREAKTHOUGH by far. This workout works your whole body, even abs. The strength training is short but indicated to burn more fat not really totally shape your arms. I use her LWTLW time saver for upper and lower body in only 20 minutes for each. This one is a challenge so be prepared! Kathy is my favorite by far. I've had other tapes but for some reason, I was annoyed by them (Denise Austin) and preferred to workout to Kathy. She's not annoying and wants to get the job done."
4,This one will work you,"Although I think that this step tape lacks the energy and inspiration of some of Kathy's other tapes (time-saver cardio fat burner, for instance), it does provide a good step workout. Waves one and two will make you think that the workout isn't that intense, until wave three comes along and kicks your ... I do wish Kathy would get some background music that doesn't sound like white noise, sometimes just a good music track can turn a decent routine into a great one. As always, you can count on Kathy to give you a solid workout that is easy to follow and understand."
3,Good but needs editing,"I love Kathy Smith, and the workout is certainly fat-burning, but many of the miscues could have been corrected by better editing. Even after finally getting all the moves down (it took a month!), I am still tripped up by some of the verbal mistakes. Also, there is not nearly enough time to ""drink some water and pick up your heavier weights""! I spent a lot of time hitting pause and rewind before deciding to just pick up whenever I could. And I end up stretching more than the tape allows for after such a workout. One last concern -- while Maddie's choreography is certainly top-notch, her form looks dangerous and in contradiction to a lot of what Kathy says and what I've read about form. Clara, however, is engergized and inspiring! I use this tape three days a week and have had great results. I'd buy another copy if the edits were made."
5,Great!,"The first time I did this video I felt really frusterated because I couldn't get the steps right. I almost threw it out the window, but then the next day I decided to give it one more try, but this time I really took it slow and took time to learn the moves. Once you get the moves you won't forget them, and they aren't hard to understand, just the first time you do it you might need to take it slow and rewind a few times, but after that,wow what an amazing tape. I'd have to say I love to exercise, and I have many tapes, but this is my first Kathy Smith, but it definitely won't be my last! I didn't feel sore the next day, but I DEFINITELY worked up a sweat and knew I got a great workout. If your looking for a new tape, THIS IS THE ONE TO GET!"
4,Difficult at first.............,"I bought this workout tape about 4 months ago when I started working out at home. At first I couldn't do the workout because it was so complicated, so I left it on my shelf and worked on other (more beginner oriented) videos. Finally I decided to give it another chance, and slowly started building through it and learning the routine. I started by doing just one ""wave"" a day. Then 3 weeks ago I completed the whole routine and now I can't stop. This is now my favorite video and such an awesome workout. So my advice is that this may be too hard for a beginner but if you slowly build up to it, you will definitely reap the rewards."
4,Fun workout,This is a fast-paced step workout with weight training intervals between the aerobics. As usual Kathy and her cast seem to be having a good time while they are working out and she offers more advanced moves and modifications for those just starting out. Good workout
3,A DECENT VIDEO...,"This video gives the body a wonderful workout, however it has its flaws. One, Kathy's cueing is a bit off and the moves are at times a little difficult. I had to lower my step and then I even did a little on the floor 'cause the moves were so intense. However, the weight portion of the video is great and the abs portion is also very good. Kathy does exactly 100 situps but they're varied, so it's not hard, but it is challenging. All in all, I think this video is a good addition to any workout, but just be careful and work at your own pace."
3,I thought I was buying a STEP video..not a DANCE video,Way too dancy. Good quick pace and decent beat in the background. This one's gonna collect dust on my shelf since I'm not the most coordinated person in the world :/
1,Only for Kathy Smith's fans,"This is my first (probably last) Kathy Smith's video, but I workout everyday, so all the time I look for new workouts not to be board doing the same routines over and over.I bought this video with great expectations after reading the reviews. It was exactly what I was looking for: 50 minutes workout, hi energy, fun...When I actually tried it I found it to be very frustrating: the instructions are not clear and sometimes misleading, the choreography is too complicated to follow at home - she turns around all the time, so if I do what she does I find myself with my back to the TV, and this is the point when she makes a change in the move ... moreover, if I follow her exactly I find I do twice the same side. I tried doing the workout several times, because I liked the music etc - but thanks, I stay with Gilead, Karen Voight and even my old Jane FondaBottom line: If you know and love Kathy's style than you will probably love this one as well, otherwise - don't touch it."
3,"A good workout, but inaccessible audio for the deaf and HOH","It's amazing to me that a video in this new millennium is not closed-captioned for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. I've seen several Kathy Smith videos from earlier years, and none of those is captioned either.For people with hearing disabilities, who often work out at home, the visual cues provided by captioning are essential for a successful training session, instead of an exercise in frustration.Bottom line: I would buy many more of Kathy Smith's products if they were accessible to me. Until they are, I won't spend any more money on them."
2,Good aerobic tape but modulation needed with Kathy's voice,"I think this is a good exertional aerobic tape. Kathy's voice though is particularly annoying, she tends to be high pitched at times. The girls seem to have their own agenda, vying to be seen for their own needs. I would recommend Gin Miller's Intense Moves, she's great, she's tireless, voice is perfect and inspirational, her crew seems to be more down to earth."
3,Hard to follow the steps on this one,"I use Kathy Smith's tapes exclusively and recently added this one to my collection. I didn't realize it was step, but was ready to try. I love the other tapes because you get a really great workout using standard, repetitive moves, however this one was extremely hard to follow. I had to stop repeatedly to learn the steps, which I find very irritating and non-productive. I'm going to keep trying, though, because I really like her style in general."
4,great workout,"this workout is great. the moves are a little harder to follow and can be confusing at first. i had to watch it before hand and rewind alot before i could even get ALL of the steps correctly. it may seem like basic moves but once you get going it makes you sweat! combining it is not long at all..it is just the right amt of workout plus the weights section is great for toning the arms..i have always looked for a workout w/weights and Denise Austin has it but is soooo much annoying. KS is great. i own almost all of her tapes. if you are looking for a good heart raising workout but not to intense, get this one. just preview it before you actually do the moves."
3,One of Kathy's Best!,"This is my favorite video by Kathy Smith! It's a great workout with a nice outdoor environment. The moves take a few times to get down, but the payoff is wonderful! I've been doing it since Feb. and I've already lost 10 lbs. with minimal dieting."
2,Too Dancy,"If you prefer athletic routines that focus on getting the job done, you will not like this tape. The moves are too complicated for the level of intensity."
2,BETTER BE FAST ON YOUR FEET!!!,"I have been running regularly for the past 6 months, so with winter here, I thought I could use a good cardio workout. I already own ULTIMATE PILATES and LIFT WEIGHTS TO LOSE WEIGHT 2 from Kathy Smith, and I truely enjoy them. As for FAT BURNING BREAKTHROUGH, my mistake was not reading all the reviews before purchasing it.I agree with customers who said the step routine was very complicated.

Any suggestions?"
2,A little too complicated...,"First, I want to say that I like Kathy Smith -I own 5 of her tapes and use them a lot. This one however, did not work for me. The problem is that the footwork is very complicated. I admit that I'm not the most coordinated person in the world, but I can usually keep up well enough to keep exercising. With this video, I got so confused with all the turns, side steps and step-ups at awkward angles, that I couldn't keep up with what they were doing. It was very frustrating. If you are looking for a good workout with relatively simple footwork (like me), this one isn't for you."
4,My first review - 4 stars!,"I really enjoy this tape and use it often. I particularly favor the 'zoning' or waves as she calls it. 3 zones that progressively get harder and each one definetly build on one another. The end is a killer when your 'popping' up in the middle between side squats! Defintely a worthwhile tape that uses time efficiently and pacts a lot of cardio into its zones. I think having the weight training at the ends is a good idea, but dont think you're going to use heavy weights- more for toning so stick to the lower weights."
3,Grueling Workout,"I have 4 other Kathy Smith workout videos and this one is by far the most complex, but varied, of the ones I have. This workout primarily revolves around step aerobics with arm weights (including push ups!), abdominal crunches (including bicycling moves) and exercises for the back. I found the aerobic routines very confusing and suggest to new viewers that they review the video first, learn the steps and routines, and then workout to the tape. The routines will be a lot less frustrating once you already know the steps as there is not much repetition and Kathy moves quickly with little cueing. I find this video to be the most challenging and intense and will reserve it for days when I have a lot of energy."
4,I love Kathy Smith,"This is a great workout and its outdoors, which is a nice change of pace from the livingroom. The moves are a little complicated towards the end (turns, leg twirls, etc.) so I opt to leave them out and adapt my own style instead. Its a good foundation workout that you can do more than twice a week. I really like it."
4,One of my favorites!,"I have been using Kathy Smith videos for thirteen years and wondered if she would create another workout video as good and effective as her ""Weightloss Workout"". Well, she did! This is one of my favorite videos. This step workout builds up to an intense and challenging workout routine immediately followed by a toning segment then the whole process repeats itself ending with a decent ab workout. The toning segments are not difficult (a little too easy for advanced exercisers-you will need to use heavier weights) but is necessary for the cool down or water breaks. This is an effective video. You will see results especially if you hit a plateau."
4,Excellent Civil War Biography,"I would have to agree with the previous review. This is one of the best Civil War biographies I have read in some time and I have not seen one better on Johnston yet. The author, I believe, offers a non-baised account of this Confederate leader and writes in a style that just keeps you turning the pages. The book is well researched and very well written, it was a joy to read. I have no hesitation in recommending this book to anyone who enjoys reading a decent history book. Well done to the author."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent, well written, un-biased look at the life and military carrier of Joseph E. Johnston. I now better understand Johnston's strategies, and the numerous problems between himself and President Davis. I must read to better understand the war in the western theater of operations."
3,enhancer,"Vigrx Oil arrived on schedule and in good condition. Effectiveness of this type of product depends on the immediacy of follow up with an understanding partner. The greater anticipation contributes to greater effectiveness. That said, this product is, for me, less effective than using Maxoderm or Vazogel. The addition of Aloe in the product appears to contribute to the sticky after effect, prior to penetration. Both Maxoderm and, especially, Vazogel have a more neutral feel after absorbtion. However, you may experience something different. All three pproducts are helpful when used as directed. Price and shelf life would have to be considered. I can recommend Vigrx Oil because it works. The other two products that I have tried work more effectively."
2,"good info., poorly written","Decent information for beginners to the field of solar physics.However, in a couple ways this book is a fine example of how NOTto write a science book. Lang states numbers and units in a very distracting way: for instance, ""1.5 thousand meters"" and on a diagram of the Sun, 15 M(degree sign) for the central temperature.On page 73 we read, about the Sun's oscillations: ""That interval is similar to the separation between the most intense contractions during child birth, at least during the birth of my children.""OK, did we really need to know that in an _astrophysics_ text?"
5,One of the best eighties shows around,"I never got to watch this show when I was a kid. We didn't get any channels with it on. I had to get all the information on this show second hand from friends and magazines. Now, I finally got to see just how good it was for myself.The four episodes on this disc are easily some of the best, albeit there are a few things that now seem cheesy that wouldn't have then, but that's par for course for all eighties shows. Kids gotta start somewhere, I suppose.If you like eighties shows, and overgrown plants out to destroy the universe as a whole, and transmutation of other substances into gold, this will definitely be a great show for you."
3,Reliving childhood,"I bought this because I was a fan of the show when I was younger. Its a little cheesier than I remember, but it was bought for nostalgia nothing more."
5,Outstanding Reference for Software Engineers,I've been involved with many different projects in a team environment. This book contains some of the best and most respected procedures to complete a team project. I've used these methods and they work well! The principles outlined in this book apply to more than just software engineering. Take a look! You'll be glad you did!
1,totalitarian control is not the answer,"A state-of-the-art process for producing PL/I programs on punchcards. If you can master PSP/TSP, you will be more effective than 99% of all software developers at filling out forms and producing status reports. A shockingly wasteful approach to quality management."
1,"hmmmmm, it's over, at least","What a BORING movie.This is the last Karloff film and I don't know why he accepted this weak script.The story focuses arround a mexican comunity and its famous (blind) sculptor (Mr. Karloff), Mr Karloff wife is a sadistic assasin who hide her victims corpses inside her housband's sculptures and... THAT'S ALL, the film don't have any surprise or twist or... something.Don't waste your time watching this awful movie, if you like to see a good horror movie watch: Suspiria, The Shining inclusive the Simpsons halloween specials are more scary that ""Cauldron of Blood"""
4,"Magic Slim & The Teardrops - See What You're Doin' To Me: The Zoo Bar Collection, Vol. 2 (Wolfetones, 1998)","Second set of Magic Slim's five recorded appearances at Nebraska's Zoo Bar captured in 1998 with Alabama Junior Pettis and his brother Nick Holt. All the attributes are here: down-beat rhythm, Chicago sound, economy but intense band. As good as always.Enjoy the Blues from the last of Windy City's true sons.Personnel: Magic Slim (vocals, guitar); Alabama Pettis, Jr. (vocals, guitar); Nick Holt (vocals); Peter Allen (guitar); Nate Applewhite (drums).pastblues.com"
5,Herbie Hears the Horn,I am a parent of a hearing impaired child and enjoyed this book thoroughly. It has been a wonderful resource for helping her learn about her hearing aid and also for sharing with her friends and classmates. It definitely gets 5 stars!
5,Blown Away!!,"This cd has just blown me away, I am very struck over it,Its so Romantic and I have found a few songs that really are into a personal problem i am dealing with..I Love Hoja en Blanco ..I bought the cd for that song,But after hearing the whole cd ..Wow i can say there are Lots of songs on the I relate to and have made this cd #1 on my list..I play it practicaly 24/7....... It's the Best ever!!"
3,Great story - horrible tape quality,"The live action segments at the beginning and ending have a nasty red tint. Vanessa Redgrave nicely sets up the story riding in a boat on the Thames, but the color quality makes it nearly impossible to watch. The cartoon color is better but still not the greatest."
5,Stop calling me Fred....My name's Adolf!,"Well pass the groat clusters, but be sure to use your entrenching tools! After an altogether too long a hiatus from the shelves, the Firesign classic 'Dwarf' album returns to cd form. I had a friend in the mid 80's who told me that these new fangled cd's are replacing old vinyl, so I had better get me one and toss out my albums. So I did, including my entire Firesign collection. Fifteen years later I have finally gotten 'Dwarf' on cd. It was worth the wait. Within the first thirty seconds of Pastor Flash's return to earth, I was in heaven. A classic returns! Vive le George Tirebiter!"
5,Don't Crush That Dwarf!,"Reliving your youth can be a real joy sometimes. The Firesign Theatre was THE comedy team in the 70's. Combining thoughtful observations with unbridled hilarity, Firesign Theatre made sense in a perhaps too serious culture. This product was my personal favorite, and repeated listening still brings out nuances in the recording. In this, there seems to be a life review for one George Tirebiter, at least he looks like the main charactor. 'Dave Casmin' plays Porgie Tirebiter in the mini-episode of ""High School Madness"". At least it appears that way as we rollercoaster our way through the various scenarios. You have to see for yourself on the most outrageous ride of your life. The Firesign Theatre has been around over 40 years and has put out a body of work that still brings humor into our lives."
1,past revisited,I bought four firesign cd's Had them on 33's when first released. I can't believe I thought this stuff was funny 30 years ago.
1,"""Dwarf"" is 5 stars - this CD is 0","I'm listening to this right now, and I have to say that I'm sorry I didn't wait for the Sony reissue. This is obviously ""remastered"" from a not-too clean vinyl pressing, with little attempt to disguise the turntable rumble, clicks and pops, and distortion due to wear. Worse, the CD case was shattered when I received it, though Amazon thoughtfully included another broken CD case that combined made a semi-functional case. I've read on the firesign newsgroup that at least one other person received a broken case from another retailer, so I suspect that the fault likes with Evangenline Records.I just had to turn this off because the distortion was so bad. What a disappointment, and a waste of money. Go with the Sony reissues; they've got to be better than this."
3,Disappointed,"I bought this CD as a Christmas gift, and when it came, it was open. So when i gave the gift, I didn't feel that great. I bought it as a new CD, not an opened cd."
4,comedy satire,"It is very 70's and I remembered it well. I gave it to my son so he could have a taste of ""firesign"" Forerunners of Saturday Nite Live?"
5,Best Comedy Recording Ever?,"Some argue it is, it's certainly up there, an amazing journey in a surrealistic future experienced via the tv of one George Tirebiter, who can't get any groatclusters in his sector, as they never come up into the hills. It's dense and amazing, hard to describe well, and a must listen.'We've been shooting reds and yellows all day''Boy I'm sleepy'"
1,What Did I Miss?,"This was beyond all doubt, the most disappointing book I have read in years. In fact, I must admit I did not finish ""Actual Innocence"". I gave up and gave it to Goodwill! Was this reallly the same author who produced ""Death in White Bear Lake""? Oh well....."
2,The only thing...,I liked about this Bible was the new King James translation. The pre-trib rapture is bogus and does not fit in with historical Chrisitian teaching. Save your money.
5,Cooler Climate - Inspirational,"Having come from a similar working relation as the character Sally Field portrayed in this movie was therapeutic. The first time I saw it on TV, I felt like this movie was made just for me. I reflected on my own experience and in doing so allowed the healing process to begin. After viewing it again recently it reminded of the turning point in my professional career and I knew it belonged in my library. It might be hokey to some people, but, I just love positive, uplifting, happy endings. Plus the scenery was absolutely beautiful."
4,Inspirational,"Ms. Fields inspirational and heartbreaking portrial of Iris helped me move past my own divorce. Not the best acting but a solid movie non the less. While I would love to own it, I can't for the life of me imagine why a VHS tape is $42.95 unless it comes with the VHS player."
2,A Cooler Climate,"I just saw this movie on [TV], and though I had not seen a Judy Davis movie that I didn't like prior to this, the ending was way too hokey and contrived for my taste. Davis had some terrific moments evoking a shallow, lonely and enraged soul, but her transformation from deep depression to loving sensitive light hearted soul in the course of a day, went beyond my ability to suspend my disbelief. Field who is another great actress whose character here is the flying nun grown older. I guess I'm one of those males who just doesn't get it, but because I do like these two actresses, I was driven to see other reactions to this film."
3,"Outrageous Plot, but Still Enjoyable","Cassie is on a scouting trip for the FCC in Alaska when she is trapped in a cave by an avalanche. When she enters the cave, however, she finds a strange man who doesn't speak any language she's ever heard and who has been trapped in the cave for God knows how long. Then Cassie realizes that the mysterious stranger is the man of her dreams -- literally.Despite a plot so outrageous it makes me laugh to think of it, York handles the story in the best way possible (under the circumstances), and builds the suspence very nicely as the book progresses. It's not literature, but it's good for a quick, light read on a rainy day."
2,"The essence of a Hollywood legend, if not the whole story","Having read several of Higham's biographies, I've come to the conclusion that he's more or less in the category of Kitty Kelley, if not quite as free and easy with twisting the truth around.This bio. is itself, ok, but could have been a lot better. For one thing, (big pet peeve), The author is simply not careful with dates, and therefore one worries that he's not careful with other information as well. For example, observant readers will love Bette's 13-month-long pregnancy with daughter BD Hyman.The book was published in 1981, and so is pre-Bette's strokes and mastectomy, and pre ""My Mother's Keeper"".Not a bad read, but there are many others, written a little more carefully and covering Bette's entire life, which are more worth the reader's time."
5,Springfield Marine Co 9 X 7-Inch Taperlock Deck Base,I purchased 2 of these to replace the ones in my boat which were stress cracked. The first style I bought I sent back because it was not quality enough so I went to this one which is the same as my original. Sometimes you can't settle for aftermarket products.
1,DO NOT BUY,"I was searching for some classical music at an online music store, and I came across the ""Cantanti Collection."" They are so horrible that I don't see how they have their own CD. I don't know if those songs are supposed to be for comedy or what, but I don't see how they seriously have a record deal and how their album is being sold. Don't buy it; it'll be a waste of your money!"
1,Pass on this book,"If you are a do-it-yourselfer looking to do your own interior work, you will be disappointed with this book. The information is very basic, and it deals only with cleaning and replacing factory items. There is little to be learned here about customizing or doing your own upholstery work. Most of the information is just common sense to anyone who has been doing their own work."
3,"A good starter, but there are no big secrets here!","I purchased this book after I had already begun stripping the interior in my 1998 Jetta GLX. I was hoping to find some tips on sewing. However, the book explicitly states that sewing is outside the scope of the book, and the author recommends that the reader find a professional source for sewing needs. In addition, the book's focus is on older domestic vehicles, so the author's recommedations that one find ""restoration kits"" may not be applicable for newer imports. Nonetheless, I found some of the information to be quite useful, such as the types of tools needed for this work, the adhesives used, and a fairly instructional section concerning the refurbishing of the headliner. Its not a true DIY book, but it is a decent guide. If there were fractional stars in the rating system, I would give it 3.5 stars, though I can't make myself give it 4."
1,Not a learning reference,"Not a book on how to upholster a vehicle.Steps basically read as follows.1.Unbolt part needing repair2.Purchase new part3.Bolt part back on.Not very informative, would suggest Don Taylor books."
1,Out of date,"This book would be adequate only for an entry level user of the original ibook. It is not applicable to todays ibooks. It does not contain information about iphoto, itunes, imovie, OS X, or Jaguar. It does not help with topics related to CD burning, using a digital cameras with your ibook, or playing DVD's on your ibook. A person purchasing a new ibook would want a more current book."
4,Still Works,"Is there a reason for living with discontinued technology? In case of the iBook, I have found the answer to be yes. It has become a very private notenook. As time moves on and support becomes less, the old iBook still works great for music and work I want to keep private. There are situations where one always asks how do I do this or when something happens, how do I get out of that. This book is great at helping when those times happen. David Pogue has written books on all things Apple long before he needed to hear about Prilisec. He is among the best writing for people who are able to read plain English and just need help. The book is fun to read and will answer more then enough questions to make it worth the price."
2,Faster Pussycat - 'Between The Valley Of The Ultra P***y' (Cleopatra),"Not as bad as some fans or even critics have said it was. Certainly nothing special. I guess the remixes of Faster Pussycat staples like ""Bathroom Wall"", ""Poison Ivy"", their power ballad ""House Of Pain"", ""Cathouse"" (my personal PF favorite) and the band's Kelly Bundy tribute song ""Slip Of The Tongue"" are so-so but it does show us how [like many other artists] are simply trying to keep up with the times. Strictly for the completists and die-hard fans."
2,Eh...,"I had no idea I was getting a remix album. Apparently, I missed the review as I bought it from this site. I was so excited to see what I thought was a Greatest Hits but as soon as I listened to it, I was like WTF. I hate remixes anyway and although, they sounded pretty cool, I have not listened to it since. I even gave it to my bf who normally loves remixes and he returned it to me saying it was awful. Thank goodness I didn't pay full price for it or I would have been pissed. I guess if you like remixes, buy it cuz they do sound really cool but if you are expecting old school FP, don't waste your money."
1,"So ""5 Minutes Ago"" ....","The only member of Faster Pussycat to have anything to do with this release is Taime Downe ... ummmm ... ok ... Remeber when Hammer tried to go ""gangsta"" ??? ... Well, this is as sad an attempt to ""update"" as anything I've heard .........The mid 90's are ( thankfully ) over, and this cd sounds more passe than anything he did with the band in the 80s ..... If ya want something cool and modern, try Placebo .... If ya want something like old Pussycat, try The Donnas or Buckcherry ... This is just a sad attempt to cash in on the FP reunion, and my advice is to spend you money on something that's more sincere ...."
5,Marvel of honesty and enlightenment,Heller's book is a marvel of honesty and enlightenment from a thorough mind. She writes in a way that completely engrossed me. I'm already looking forward to her next book.
5,High Praise for Seige: A Novel of the Eastern Front,"The late Russ Schneider's scholarship and passion for this forgotten theater of WWII permeate his masterpiece. Through his all-seeing lens, we are drawn reluctantly into the blood-soaked maul of the Eastern Front.The major events are historically accurate, and it matters little that Schneider's characters - officers and foot soldiers, Germans and Russians alike - are fictionalized. As they ready themselves for battle and almost certain death, they draw the breath of life. We experience their inconsolable fears, their unimaginable hardships amid the shelled landscape and existentialist horror of burned, eviscerated comrades.It would be premature, a disservice to Russ Schneider's legacy, to compare his tale with the established literary canon of wartime courage and futility. Surely, with the passage of years, as more and more readers discover this fine book for themselves, ""Seige"" will be identified as an incomparable classic."
1,Grave errors,"Although the novel wasn't bad, there are 2 glaring errors that caused me to give it only one star. First of all, the final chapter (#28) was out of sequence. It belonged somewhere around chapter 20 or there abouts. A really stupid error. The second thing that bothered me is the Epilogue. Usually in an epilogue, the author ties up any loose ends and perhaps throws in some background info about what happened after the events in the book. This the author did. However, he specifically mentions that the leading General in the book, General Scherer met with an author by the name of Lucas in 1977 to help him write the history of the battle of Cholm. This is absurd, since the general died in an auto accident in 1955!!! And the author should have known this since Siege was published in 2003! A big disappointment."
4,GEO. ADKINS,"I LIKED IT,IT GAVE ME A FEEL OF THE HOPELESSNESS OF THE RUSSIAN FRONT, FOR THE GERMAN SOLDIER. I DO NOT NOT KNOW HOW FACTUAL IT WAS, BUT AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED THIS BOOK SERVED IT'S PURPOSE. I WOULD RECOMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO INTERESTED IN THE EXPERIENCE.WELL WRITTEN,KEPT MY ATTENTION,REALLY GOOD GREAT BOOK. I AM GLAD I READ IT."
2,Meandering and disappointing,"An interesting, unique subject, but poorly written. The author is a better enthusiast than a writer. The book has many very, very wordy passages and musings that go nowhere. Although it could have been a great book, in the end it is disappointing."
3,Good for starting,"Hi, I just got everquest online adventures and the online adapter so I figured it would'nt hurt to get this guide along with it. Well the guide is ok.. I mean by ok that it is only average. The guide tells you were to go for the first 5 quest and after that you better start shouting what is the quest for your level. Also it only gives abilty list for up to levels 20. This guide is good but not worth your money. Please dont be stupid and waste your money on a average guide like me. If anyone does need help with it look me up im in marr's fist server under the name gamukaz on a troll warrior."
3,Great book but lacking,"Just got this Today. Well put together, Excellent images, good for starting out for the first 7 lvls of any character with quests and tips - then it's lacking of anything else. Lists the spells for the first 20 lvls of every charater. A mixed help, if you've played the PC version, the beta version or have experience with similar games this guide is going to be a waste of money to you. Sorry. Don't let this reveiw stop you from buying the game though, Buy the game, play the game, live the game, the best thing to come before the release of Final Fantasy X1 Online."
5,love these plates,"I love fiestware. I love the color. I have several place settings and serving trays in turquoise, blue, purple and white. And now I've started a fall collection with orange and purple. These plates are very durable and don't crack easily."
1,Great bang for the buck???,"The Honda dealer replaced the original Honda muffler w/ a Quiet flow 3 years ago when I bought the car used. The design is poor because the long outer sheet metal seam is folded in such a way that it is a trough to collect water, snow & salt to rot the muffler. The ends of the trough terminate at the Front & Rear muffler end seams where the rust destroys the muffler.The only reason I bought the Quiet flow was the $31.99 price. (It was labeled as ""used"", but it was brand new.)I loaded up the trough w/ hi temp caulk so the water can't collect there. NOTE: If the seam was folded in the opposite direction the trough would be upside-down and would not collect any water makeing the muffler last much longer. Shame on you WALKER!"
3,Quirky black comedy,"The Japanese do a great job with horror and quirky black comedies, and this is no exception. Heaps of fun, but not for those who are easily disturbed."
1,Blockbuster,"Well I rented this from Blockbuster when I was on a Japanese movie spree. Pretty dissapointing. It isn't a typical artsy OR gory Japanese movie. Charaters voices were dubbed with english, if I remember correctly. I guess if you just want to watch a random film its okay, but don't have any expectations. Rent it, don't buy it."
1,An Infuriating Book,"After finishing a Bachelor's degree in math, I went back to school for electrical engineering and took a class on harmonic analysis. I'd previously taken some analysis but could not understand this book at all; it was completely incomprehensible. The only reason I think they used it was the guy who wrote it worked for the university. You should read this book if and only if you meet at least one of the two following qualifications:1) You are a gifted, knowledgeable mathematician. (This would be a good review for a PhD student.)2) You MUST use this book for a class."
1,Horrible book,"No examples, just a book of proof's. This is a horrible book and the professor that is teaching this class for the first time said the same thing. Notation is not standerd which is a big problem in understanding what the author is tring to do."
1,The book is not useful unless you're already a mathematician,"After struggling with this book for a semester, it became apparent to me that while the book is rich in scope, its allusions to so many branches of mathematics and incomplete detailing of these allusions merely serve to bewilder the undergraduate and rookie grad. student of mathematics. Indeed, the book is an excellent reference for those who are already EXTREMELY well-versed in the subject and/or are looking to branch out into more detail and abstraction. For the rest of us, however, this book is ENTIRELY unsuitable--even, I daresay, for the ""advanced undergraduate"" this book purports to aim itself at. So ignore the hype of professional book reviewers and take it from someone in the trenches: buy something intelligible from the myriad of books out there on Fourier Theory and Harmonic Analysis."
3,Great DVD but BE WARNED!!,"This dvd is a five star production and I enjoyed it immensely.I gave it three stars however because when I received the dvd it was very poor quality, it was pixelated most of the time. I noticed on the back of the dvd sleeve that it was a single layer dvd which means they compressed 160 minutes of footage onto a single layer instead of a double layer hence the poor quality. I wrote an email to denon to complain about this and they apologised and admitted their mistake and promptly sent me a proper dvd, they also pointed out that this had nothing to do with Andre himself.But all this aside, this is a terrific Andre Rieu concert dvd and well worth a look. His live performances are colorful and joyful, all the performers look like they are enjoying themselves and the crowd really gets into it. The choice of music is also excellent. You will absolutely love the 3 year old violinist, absolutely priceless. If you want to put a smile on your dial check this one out."
2,The Flying Dutchman,"I read all the costumer's reviews and they are all true to the bones.They're discriptions are right on target.""Two-stars"" all i can say.I should have consult this reviews before i bought this.But i truly not expexting this one would be a faulty product."
3,Least entertaining,"This is typical Andre Rieu, however, of all the concerts, it has more repeats and is not as entertaining as the others."
5,I Give It 5 Stars BUT,"I gave this DVD 5 stars for the MUSIC, but when I hadwatched it on television it had English Subtitles and soI assumed this one would, especially since I was buyingit in the United States!!It DOES NOT have English Subtitles and although you canenjoy the music ... without knowing what Andre is sayingyou have no clue what's going on, not to mention you missout on his charm and humor which is so much a part of hislive concerts ...I would not recommend buying this DVD from here at all andwould strongly suggest ordering it from Andre's Homepage ...THAT one has the English Subtitles! (As this one SHOULD have!)"
2,Andre Rieu at his best but producers need a quality lesson,"As a decade long admirer of his talent, Andre Rieu is by far the best. We purchase every DVD and CD upon release. Originally this DVD fell short. The sub-title errors were corrected. Andre Rieu is at his best. His music is a 10+, the 3 bonus tracks audio portion of the DVD is a 9.Careful viewing detects a split second out of phase of video and sound."
3,What is Andre saying?,"Where is the subtitle? I thought my DVD was defective until I read that another reviewer couldn't see the subtitle either. Part of the fun of seeing Andre perform was his witty remarks and funny stories. Since I have no idea what he is saying, it took away alot of the fun.This is DVD5 so the capacity is only half of a regular DVD movie. Trying to cram over 2 hours of video plus 5.1 audio on a single layer DVD means compromise has to be made. The video quality is really subpar and it is not tru 16:9 aspect ratio. It has black bars on top and bottom of the video stream.I am a big fan of Andre and owns every one of this DVDs. This is really one of the most disappointing. The performances in Dublin and Tuscany are my favorite.According to the DVD case, this DVD is region 0. It should play in any region."
4,"English, please!","I love Andre's videos, and this one is as good as the rest, with the following exception: they forgot to put the subtitles on the dvd! So, for 2 hours I felt like a complete foreigner trying to understand what they were saying (I think it was dutch). Maybe it was just my copy, who knows? But it certainly makes it frustrating!!!"
1,"Andre Rieu, The Flying Dutchman","Saw the truncated PBS broadcast, and thought by buying the ""real thing,"" i.e., the DVD, I'd get in this age of HDTV and 5.1 Dolby sound an admirable production to fit my very sophistaced home theatre set up.Am I wrong!! While I got a good Dolby 5.1 surround sound with my Yamaha Sub woofer, et al, The video, on the other hand was abomidible- hideous, dusgustingly bad!485 lines!!?? old standard TV nonsense, As about as far removed from good 21st century definition as 1840 daguerreotypes!I got had! Sheesh, what a fraud perpertrated by Denon and Andre Rieu Studios.Well, anyway, I turned off the video and am listening to the audio, sadder but wiser."
2,Flying Dutchman is flying really low,"The video quality on this dvd is extremely poor quality. This is unacceptable for an Andre Rieu product. I hope he gets feedback on his products, because if he does he would buy everyone of them back or make a good quality dvd available of it! If I had known that this product was this bad I would not have purchased it"
2,Andre Should Be Embarassed,I can't believe Andre would allow such a terrible production. The picture quality is VERY POOR! No subtitles which is bad enough but the blurry video is a disgrace!
1,Not supported by Denon,"Unfortunately I have one of the defective DVD's that others have written about. While Denon's web site describes how to get a replacement, the address is actually invalid and the email for Savoy/Denon doesn't function. I was able to find a copy on ebay with Andre in the airplane and it plays great. It is actually a French version, but has English sub-titles and is in full 16:9 format. Beware of the U.S. version. My original copy is almost un-watchable."
4,Delightful DVD!,Andre Rieu makes a wonderful evening out of watching a DVD filled with talent and showmanship. Much more uplifting than Law and Order and can be enjoyed over and over.
3,No Subtitles?,"I originally posted a five star review of this concert, based on the import copy I ordered through the official Andre Rieu website (andrerieu.com). I assumed the American release would be the same. Apparently, I was wrong. I can't imagine why the American release wouldn't have subtitles. The copy I ordered from Andre's website DOES have English subtitles, which work fine. It is also full screen. It has a different cover, too (Andre in an airplane, holding his violin). I would not necessarily recommend this DVD without subtitles, unless you can speak Dutch."
1,Denon to the Rescue!,"Originally, I posted a one-star review for this DVD.Since that time, I've been in contact with Denon and they recognize there are problems with the disc.They've apologized for the error and have since shipped a replacement DVD.I can't change my rating, but I'd give this disc four stars now.This replacement is MUCH better than the one in my first review. There are English subtitles! (This is great, because I didn't want to have to go study Dutch just to know what they were saying.)The video quality is much improved, and the picture is anamorphic widescreen. It looks better...much better.The audio is still the high-quality as in the first disc.Alas, there's still the scenes with ""Otto"", but that's why we have fast-forward buttons on the DVD remote.Once again, if you bought this disc previously, please contact Denon (http://denonclassics.com/sites/denon/) and make arrangements for a replacement. You'll be glad you did."
2,Poor Picture quality,"While the DVD I bought, brought good content and sound the picture quality was less than I would excpect from any company.As stated by previous reviewers the ""pixalation"" of the video is horrible and is dizzying. Technically I do not know what went wrong with this production but I have never, ever, seen such poor picture quality in any DVD that I have ever purchased. Andre is such a classy guy I can't believe he let this one get by him. I hope he rights this wrong.I did have English subtitles on my DVD."
2,disappointing,"The audio in 5.1 surround was fine, the package I bought,. said it was in english. It was not, there were no subtitles. It also said it was in the 16:9 ratio, it was not, it was in 4:3. I was Very disappointed."
2,Not leather-like and too narrow.,"When the description for the product said ""leather-like"" and ""desk-top organizer,"" I was expecting something heavy with some kind of faux- leather finish. This organizer is sturdy, but made from the same standard cardboard material most expandable files are made from. The ""leather"" design printed on the front and back isn't even slightly convincing or attractive. Very deceptive advertising.I found the organizer to be much too narrow, to hold much of anything, let alone it's advertised 900+ sheets of paper. The pockets are not large enough to hold a file folder so I'm always fishing around the bottom for loose papers. The open top is convenient, but the size and construction make it a fairly disposable item. Doesn't really work for me."
4,Sturdy and holds a lot,"I really do like this expanding file! It is sturdy and it holds a lot, while still feeling secure. There is reinforcement at the top and bottom of the ""accordian"" part, and in the month or two that I've had this, it simply does not seem like it is going to rip apart.The ""leather-like""description is a bit strange though. The 8.5x11"" sides of the folder are covered in a paper that I suppose sort-of looks like leather. It does look nice, but the phrase ""leather-like"" would not have occurred to me.I added labels over the Jan-Dec tabs, as I don't need monthly tabs. The ones there were nicely printed and easy to look at.I hate a file that comes apart, so this one is a winner!"
3,"For the right job, it'll do...","If you are looking for a file that will allow you to sort receipts or other small papers by month, then this folder would serve your purposes. It stands squarely on the floor and is not easily tipped over. It would also sit on a desk squarely. I didn't read the description very well and did not realize that there was no flap which would fold over and enclose the file. So, if you are not able to sit this file in a place where it will not tip over, I would look for another file. As for how it is made--it is very sturdy and stretches out accordion style very easily."
3,cardboard expanding file,"Not sure why it is a leather-like description, since it is made up of the typical cardboard material with a leather design rather than material. This has the months stamped on each of the 12 tabs, and holds letter sized papers. The major disappointing feature is that it lacks a latching top cover, and unless the file is stable enough to stand upright, can pose a threat of dumping at a moment's time. I used string to correct the shortcoming but it is more of a hassle than anything else. This would be more functional in a safe or box container where it cannot topple over."
5,This is the one - they fixed it!,The original Krups tamper/spoon was badly engineered and liable to break at both ends. Somehow mine lasted about 10 years with only three episodes of re-glueing and a lot of TLC. Now they fixed it - this thing will never break. It is built like a battleship.And yes it tamps and spoons just like the old one ;-)
1,This documentary is a Disgrace~,"HRH the Prince William of Wales is a very interesting person, but this movie only talks about him. There is hardly any footage on 'His Royal Highness', and the (still) pictures that they do show are only old photographs of 'His Royal Highness' when he was a toddler. People can do many things with Prince William by making movies. Having to do with his schooling, his family (very interesting), his hobbies, and we know there is alot of footage on the Prince, but the person directing and producing this documentary clearly planned on making a quickly done, low-budget film, and he succeeded, but he/she also succeeded in producing a cheaply done film."
1,Prince William,if i think about Prince William will make new video this year about his grow up. i hope so if Prince Harry will join his brother on video maybe or not im not sure. let me know about it.
3,Looks great but...,I totaly regret my decision on ordering this stroller. At first glance I was ready to rate the stroller as a perfect ten. It is sturdy. The seat is very padded and made of strong long lasting material. The tray would be hard to remove by your child but easy for an adult. It reclines flat and uses a bar not a string.Then the first trip around the block the wheels began squeaking. The sun shade is not long enough to cover very well. I'm only 5'2 and I kept kicking the braking bar. When you flip the handle bar around so the child is facing you it is very hard to manuver. And good luck folding the thing it is very hard to avoid not scratching up the tray and definetly requires two hands and a lot of patience. I don't usually rate products but this stroller is in need of some improvements.
5,Just Amazing,"These last episodes are some of the most amazing (and beautiful) I have ever seen. It was dark.. surprising and amazing.I was so intruiged by the final 4. I couldn't wait until the next week [adultswim]. By the time it was over.. I had used a couple tissues (yea.. I cant believe that..) and my mouth was hangin open. Somethings I expected... and most I did not! I dont know what will happen next.. but I can't wait. I hope there will be more!If you havent watch much of Wolf's Rain, make sure to watch these last eps! They're incredible.And don't forget to buy the soundtrack! The music is amazing too! Especially Heaven's Not Enough."
5,PREPARE TO CRY,"Im not gonna spoil it for anyone, although some people did already, but the ending was the most saddest thing I have ever seen, I literally couldnt stop crying, but it was so good too, I understand everything better now, if your a big wolfs rain fan and havent watched this, prepare the tissues."
2,Surprisingly Dissapointed,"For someone like me who had grown to love these characters, I found the ending episodes to be a let down. The ending was appropriate, but for all the characters to die and then be reborn somehow was very depressing and confusing. Though it did follow the previous episodes with the beautiful art and music, it was a very bad way to end such a great series. Almost everyone else that I talked to about the show agreed with me on this."
5,Simply One of The Best,"John Douglas writes the absolute most alarming, terrifying, intense and wonderful books in the behavioral science genre. He is the ""DON"" of FBI profiling and wrote the book (no pun intended) on psychological investigation.""The Anatomy of Motive: The FBI's Legendary Mindhunter Explores the Key To Understanding and Catching Violent Criminals"" is a premier book that is so chilling all because you know these men who wrote it have seen it all first hand. Their backgrounds in the FBI and pioneering the field of criminal profiling proves that their theories and hypothesis are on the mark.This genre fascinates me and I highly recommend this book. Douglas is well known in the field and I think this is his best work."
3,John Douglas Treading Water,"I found his first two similar books to be engrossing but this one just seems to be essentially repeating themes but with different case studies. Some chapters were very good, others were as dry as a college text-book. Whereas his earlier books could be commended for their insights into the criminal mind, the purpose of the current book seems to be to fatten the author's bank account at the expense of true-crime devotees."
3,"Good read, but...","I found inconsistencies in some of the author's points of view. As much as I respect his experience and background, as a witter he must know how to be consistent with his comments. An observant reader will catch a spin, sooner or later."
3,Great information but too much personal info,I enjoy the facts when reading books by John Douglas. I do have a hard time with the excessive focus on himself. The fact that his office was on a certain floor or that he was the one who stayed the latest to work on a case does not seem relevent. His ego takes away from learning about motive and forensic psychology. I own most of his books and use them for research but it is hard to search through all of the personal information to find the facts that I am looking for.
4,Another Very Interesting Book by Mr. Douglas,"I'm not here to write a long, elaborate review, plenty of people have already done this. I'm here simply to say: if, like me, you have a real passion for criminology then buy this book. This well-written book is full of great information and is, in my opinion, a must add to any serious collection. Is the book perfect ?? No, some people won't like how pretentious mr. Douglas can be at time, however nobody can deny that mr. Douglas is one of the most respected and credible True Crime author in the world, and because of that I think we should go beyond these flaws.So if, like me, True crimes/Criminology is more than a passion for you, then buy this book, and for less than 10$ you won't regret it. :)"
3,Interesting but author seems to think a lot about himself,"Some very interesting subjects covered, however, the author comes off as a pompous know-it-all, he goes on and on about himself. Was still an interesting read. Most of the subject matter I already had read other places, some real old stories, but still found it interesting."
2,"ME, ME, ME, and MORE ABOUT ME!!","I found that his first book, MINDHUNTER, was a phenomenal piece of reading. For the novice criminalist, I would venture to say that it could possibly serve as an astute guide to introductory profiling. However, in this the fourth jaunt into his EGO, I find it almost unbearable to read past HIS conquests and proficiency to get into the essence of the information! It was deafening the decibel level of his own horn-blowing. :)"
3,More on Motive,"Douglas takes a stunning number of cases to portray his point that a killer is not born - a killer is made. However, almost all of the cases exemplified are those he himself has been a part of. Whenever the book becomes informative, he suddenly delves into a life story or a pat-on-the-back for his life's achievements. Also, I am rather disappointed in his amateur use of language. He will scientifically explain a circumstance, then throw in a vulgarity; he interrupts his flow with his novice writing experience and in turn, makes the work very colloquial. If you are looking just to get a basis for circumstance, this is a good book, but if you are looking for something deeper, perhaps on the intermediate or advanced level of dealing with any form of forensic psychology, then this bombastic excuse is not for you."
2,Anatomy of an Egomaniac,"If you're searching for an objective analysis of violent criminals, I would keep looking. You won't find objectivity here. What you will find is John Douglas annoyingly blowing his own horn about how astute and accurate his ""profiling"" is. Douglas spends far too much time bragging about his powerful investigative instincts while he should be enlightening us with more factual information about the psychological make-up of these destructive, insidious killers."
4,Well Done,"Though repetitious in some parts (if you have read the author's other books), it is well put together and informative. Another job well done."
4,A quick read about a grisly subject.,"Douglas is one of my favorite ""true crime"" authors. Even though he spent years working in the Behavioral Science Unit at the FBI, he shows in his writing that he hasn't lost his sense of humor. His writing style keeps the reader entertained and intrigued, even when he's describing murder scenes, posed corpses, and interviews with the most abominable of criminals. John Douglas is, in my opinion, the foremost expert on forensic psychology and profiling."
4,Can you see the Killer?,"Douglas once again brings us into the minds of killers. Attention grabbing insight makes this book a stand out. Douglas picks cases and then takes you through the process of picking apart the crime,what to look for and why it was done to find the true motive behind it all. Of some interest is the warning signs to look for in others that may spell potential trouble."
4,Plenty of compassion,"Douglas doesn't claim that anyone is born bad. He's delved into what turns human beings into monsters, often an abusive upbringing, and in fact has often stated that programs like Head Start are the best way to prevent serial killers and rapists, and crime in general. He merely states that by the time he or other law enforcement officers get involved it is far too late to fix anything. Someone like John Wayne Gacy could have been helped while he was a child, but by the time the FBI is involved he's already learned that he enjoys killing. Douglas' job isn't to try and undo decades of mental developement, it is to render a very sick person incapable of doing further harm.As for calling these men cowards, I don't know what else to call a man who preys on the weak to bolster his self esteem.Douglas and Olshaker make a great writing team. Anyone who has in interest in investigation, psychology, or criminal justice should read all of their collaborative efforts."
4,First encounter of this kind,"And i must say i found it to be a VERY interesting book. It drew you in by discussing cases that are familiar to anyone who follows big news including a detailed segment on Andrew Cunanan, the serial killer. I liked how Douglas focused not so much on the sensationalism in Gianni Versace's murder but discussed every one of Cunanan's victims. I found the case of the Tylenol tampering to be extremely facinating as well. I must agree however, with the reader that commented on Douglas' ""horn-blowing"" and inflated ego. I also picked up on that attitude periodically throughout the book. But it wasn't so prevalent that it would make me rule out other books written by him. The man knows what he is talking about."
4,John Douglas' best book yet.,"I've read almost all of John Douglas' book and this is my favorite by far. Though it suffers from redundancy at points, merely repeating the same stories he's told in all of his other books, it is undoubtedly the most clearly written. I agree with some others that it reads like a textbook at points, but I actually like that aspect. I found it very easy to read, with a message less jumbled than some of his past works."
2,"Short on substance, long on purile descriptions.",The book is not without insightful comments and stories regarding the nature and motives behind certain criminal acts. However the last half of the book deals primarily with mass murderers and spree killers. These portions are simply lurid and disturbing as opposed to earlier more technical sections dealing with serial killers. One wonders why the editors at Scribners did not push for more meaningful analysis in the later parts of the book. It seems as if a project well started was rushed to completion.Douglas is somewhat self-promoting which gets in the way of his credibility at times.
4,Interesting but has some weaknesses,"If you are a student of criminal psychology or work in law enforcement, I wouldn't recommend this book (or Doulgas' ""Mindhunter"")as a study guide. I'm new to the subject, so it was an interesting read for me. However, Douglas has his flaws as a writer,in many cases jumping from one subject to the next for no apparent reason, and at first I thought his tone was a bit too conversational. However, once I forgave those flaws.. I found this book and ""Mindhunter"" fun to read (altho the books are very similar, no need to read both).After finishing both I felt as though I had just spent an evening with Douglas at a divy bar somewhere listening to his fascinating war stories. Not a bad night out."
5,Well written and informative,"I really enjoyed this. It was a fascinating overview of the types of people who commit serious crimes, and it managed to give interesting accounts without glamorizing the crimes or excusing the criminals. I don't feel like i could go out and be a profiler, but I do think I have a better understanding of what they do and how it can be used. The book had a conversational tone that flowed well, except for some parts where Douglas unexpectedly switched to the present tense. That is probably just a result of writing collaboratively, and it works pretty well. My only beef with this kindle version is that it contains a useless index; the publisher should have removed it, made its items into links, or provided location numbers. As it stands it is a big list, which is irritating. That gripe has nothing to do with the content of the book, though."
2,A killer for a hero.,"Psychological analysis aside, Theo Belk is just a killer seeking revenge and sometimes killing innocent people in the process. I found nothing in this book of interest or importance."
1,I couldn't finish it,"I couldn't get interested in the characters, especially Theo Belk. He didn't seem much better than the ""evil"" man he was hunting."
1,Worst Purchase ever,"I had a ring similar to this several years ago that was stolen from me, was very impressed by what was described online & the images shown of the item & so I bought it. BUYER BEWARE! IT IS NOTHING LIKE THE IMAGE SHOWN! I am beyond disappointed & honestly would like my money back. The ring I got was blackened, very poorly crafted, bent, dented, cracked, scratched, crooked & looked like it had been burnt to a crisp before it was sent to me (which is to say besides being mostly black all over, there is a coating of rough black substance quite like hardened soot on it).I've had some bad purchases before but this is by far the worst. Sometimes variations in the expectation of an online order are tolerable like size or color....maybe even design and style but this looked like they beat the crap out of it deliberatly before they sent it to me. I will never buy from this seller again & strongly advise against others doing so. Seriously save your money and buy elsewhere"
5,up to my standards,"This is perfect for a regular blanket or just a pillow, if you fold it up. It heats up from your body's warmth, and works nice."
5,Great for the price,"This is a very warm, high quality product for the price. It is lightweight, but will keep you toasty."
4,"Nice blanket (excuse me, woobie).","First, I have no frame of reference. So I can't say whether they're better or worse than what I used to have (since I never had one!). I bought 2 on the advice of a friend who was deployed in Iraq. They are very soft, warm, well made and would easily double for a warm weather sleeping bag if needed. Sure beats the free fleece blankets they give away at the ball park and they appear way more durable. Made by Rothco, who still does make stuff for the Military. They are labeled to appear like the stuff made here for the gov't (i.e. sewn on OD green label with care instructions, serial numbers, etc), but they are, in fact, from China. That's the only downside I can see. There are versions made in the USA, but they all appear to be in various camo patterns and I wanted black."
1,Nothing like the real thing - MADE IN CHINA,"This is nothing like the silky feeling, lightweight poncho liner from the US Army. They were made in Brooklyn. The fabric on this is coarse and not like the original (and it's made in China). Not worth the money."
2,quality problem,"I love the woobie, but this is a piece of junk. I only use it twice and some of the threads already broke, plus the stitching is really ugly. Save yourself some headache by getting a genuine poncho liner."
3,For my wife,I use one of these all the time and let my wife use it at times. The other day my wife was using mine and jokingly I said I should get you one in Pink camo. WOW she just lit up and said OK! The next day she told me my daughter wants one too!Will some one please make this in a Pink woodland Camo?Rothco do you hear me!!!!!!!!! :)
3,Not like the one I was issued in the Army,"Ordered as a gift for my friends 8yr old daughter, she was always using my surplus poncho liner so i decided to order her one. I let her pick out the color and she chose this one. She likes it a lot but I can tell the quality is not as good as the surplus ones.Overall it's good purchase."
5,Poncho Liner,"I have used poncho liners for over 30 years. Without a doubt, the poncho liner has to be one of the most outstanding items the military has developed. As a light blanket it is comfortably warm. The material wears like iron and gets softer over numerous washings. The price I paid beat the Post Exchange by about $10!"
4,...hauntingly beautiful,"reese, denis, and keith work together beautifully to make this an amazing album, musically and lyrically. the only reason i would give this a 4 is because some of the sound, like the opening beat on the first track is a little scratchy. other than that, it is flawless. i would also suggest jumping at the chance of seeing one of their rare, live shows. i saw them once and it was this that inspired the title of this review...i got shivers watching and listening to them, especially on ""under bridges"". they really work well together. a 5-star group."
5,One Listen and You'll Know They Rock,"I bought this cd about a month ago, and am now totally satisfied. I actually bought it at the Family Store, and listened to it once. After like 3 weeks, i went back to listen to it and realized what i was missing. It did take another listen to realize it was totally awesome. I listened to it like a week straight in my car. It is a lot different compared to Five Iron Frenzy. Five Iron Frenzy is Ska/ rock. Brave Saint Saturn is pure rock, with some effects. It was the best $3 i spent."
2,nothing like five iron frenzy,this album is far different from five iron frenzy stuff. it has powerfull lyrics though. im a huge ska fan and i just dont like this kind of music
4,BRAVE ASTRAUNAUTS,This CD is totally different from what I expected! Im a big fan of fiveIronFrenzy and was expecting a rock version of their silly band. But no! This is a serious different side of FIF. But the vocals are familiar and the music is very good.
1,Closet Maid Review,"The product was shipped without a back even though there didn't seem to be any room in the box to put it. I got two sides and the door as well as the top, bottom and two shelves. The unit was shipped from the US to an APO box and there was nothing I could do anymore. So basically I paid money for a defective unit I couldn't effectively use."
5,A 70's Drive In Cult Classic,"Fast action, terrific photography, great period atmosphere, colorful characters and a first-rate rock soundtrack add up to a true drive-in classic that retains its ""cult classic"" reputation even after more than 30 years.This DVD includes BOTH the 97-minute U.S. print typically seen on cable and video AND the 105-minute U.K. version which includes a couple of flashbacks featuring Charlotte Rampling that for some reason were completely excised for U.S. release. The excised scenes add just a tad more insight into Kowalski's character; while not essential to the whole plot (such as it is), these scenes ARE interesting and definitely will be appreciated by hardcore fans of the film. Kudos to 20th Century Fox for making available both versions. Being a real fan of the era that this movie was shot in, it's a kick to hear director Richard C. Sarafian's commentary track. Highly recommended!"
4,Great video in blu-ray !,"This film shooted in 1971 had an excellent video transcription to blu-ray. Greate scenes on the road, a simbolic story, and that is all. You must see to compare with films shooted today and sometimes has a bad video quality."
3,Great 70's movie,Great 70's movie but very dated by today's action movie standards. For the price I'm glad to have purchased this DVD!!!!
5,do you know a petrol head,"anyone who loves driving and dreams of muscle cars must own or at least watch this movie, else they aren't really a fan of said cars."
5,GREAT CLASSIC!,YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR COLLECTION. IF YOU LIKE SPEEDING CARS AND VERY INTERESTING CO STARS. A MUST HAVE HAVE.
4,A must have for a complete classic video collection,"Vanishing Point! Not many videos get better with age, and with every viewing, as this classic! The story of a troubled man, with the turbo charged Challenger stealing each scene. Philosophically, a race, initially of time and distance, but ultimately of the man, his past, and the car, with all finishing in a dead heat!"
3,Great chase with too slim a plotline,"I first saw this movie in 1971---I was 11---when it was released and thought it was the coolest movie ever. I've just watched it on DVD and although the car chases are spectacular, there's just not enough background information to make viewers care if Kowalski lives or dies. I guess the writers and director wanted to keep Kowalkski an ""every man"" type of guy who could be any American who suddenly feels the need to lose their past. Either way, it's hard to care for someone you don't understand. Just watch it for the chase scenes."
5,Best muscle car movie ever.,This is like an 1.5 hour long commercial for one of the greatest cars ever made. I could seriously just loop the audio of the exhaust noise and have a perfectly good night at home listening to that. If you're a fan of the Challenger you have to have this movie. Deathproof (Quentin Tarantino) is a very distant second place movie that stars this car. I love it. Get it.
4,Vanishing point: Old school movie fun!,"A good movie for its time. I knew the end before I watched it, so that took something away from it, but if you like classic car chase films that require a bit of intellect, you will enjoy this."
4,Very good old movie,"A friend recommended this movie, so I got it and watched it, enjoyed it and then sent it to him and he is enjoying it now."
3,"Nostaligic, plain and simple","Good movie, nothing spectacular. Not sure why it rates quite as highly as it does overall, was decent and reasonably entertaining, nothing more."
3,Blu-ray player dependent maybe,I received the Blu-ray DVD and even with firmware updates on my Panasonic BDP-121 Blu-ray the DVD would not play. I suspect it is because it has a dual US and UK format that the Panasonic can not handle. I don't want to condemn the DVD but the problem is unclear and may well be the Blu-rau firmware and not the DVD.
5,34years later--still holds up!,"I first saw this, accidently, as past of a double feature not too long after I finished my USAF tour of duty and was in grad school. At first, being a former jet jockey--as we said then--I was really blown away by the car and the stunts...and, a good to really good soundtrack that had several folks who went on to bigger things. I even got a white R/T Challenger. But, then I realized how Kowasksi,like many of us, had walked the straight and narrow and then the shady side of the street. But,he could not find the answer/an answer in either venue. So, he chose death. How close many people have come to that point---the vanishing point. I look at today's drug culture (culture?); the gays; the religious zealots; the racism; the drop-outs (aka slackers)and I believe little has changed. The movie, with different clothing a a few modernisms, could be made today and be as compelling and accurate. But, where do you find a car like the white Challenger?"
3,Good Service,Good service. Product was in new condition as discribed in adjust a little slow on shipping. Over all was good service
2,70s speed,"I bought this for my dad, who always claimed it as his favorite movie. The movie is one long car chase. I won't spoil the end, but it ends in a way many drugged out 1970s movies end. I don't think it's even that good of a car chase. It might be a cult classic, but I think it's just another bad memory from the 70s."
5,Going going gone,"Vanishing Point has long been a favorite movie of my brother so when I was thinking of what to give him for Christmas this year, I didn't have think for too long. I bought this for him as a gift and he has enjoyed it tremendously."
4,Vanishing Point,"The product came safely and in pristine condition. It took a little longer than expected to arrive, but not unduly so. Very happy with transaction and would definitely deal with vendor again. Thank you."
2,"Boredom, Dissapointment.","Unless you are of the select few who experienced the late 60's drug revolution, you may not enjoy this flick. I bought it just for the car and the chase scenes, which is the only thing that gave it the 2-star rating. I almost didn't finish watching it."
2,Not what I thought,"The reason I bought this movie is because of the Audioslave music video where they're paying homage. I didn't realize that the movie was going to have random naked lady scenes, and my being a lady made it kind of awkward and embarrassing to watch. Especially where this girl rides around naked on her motorcycle for 20 minutes and isn't shy about her body. So I can't recommend it because not only was the movie a little confusing, but I just don't like any kind of porn."
4,Taste in Movies,"Most of my movie selections are of the taste my lovely wife and her teenage daughter cannot understand or appreciate. As much as they love me, this Great Watch cleared the room of both within 20 minutes.For those fans of 70's vintage movies, this gem provides an enjoyable ""ride."" The lead character has about 20 lines, the panoramic (whatever that means) scenes are wonderful, and just when one thinks nothing more strange could happen, ""it"" happens.Other than that, I cannot add anything more relevant than previously offered."
4,"Goldfield,NV","I bought this movie after hearing that it was filmed in Goldfield, NV. It was so cool to see the town and what it looked like almost 40 years ago. It used to be the largest town in Nevada boasting 300,000 people a hundred years ago. The Goldfield Hotel in which Super Soul broadcasted his radio show has been featured on Fox Scariest Places on Earth, Ghost Hunters, and Ghost Adventures. As for the movie itself, it kind of seems a bit dated. Nice naked chick on the motorcycle however and cool car crashes."
5,Great Chase Flick,This has to be one of the all time best chase flicks. And if your into the classic muscle Dodge's this is the movie for you. I bought this for a friend who is still in love with the classic Dodge muscle car and he flipped.
1,Disappointed.,The color and sound was alright but I was rather disappointed in the movie itself. It was a very short movie with no introduction starting with the movie and it was a race alright but the driver and car were a total disaster in the ending part of the movie. I would not class this movie as a 1st Class movie by a long ways. I guess I was expecting a much better auto race than was in the movie. Maybe others will enjoy it but I felt it was a waste of my money personnally!!!
4,Thank Audioslave -,"for opening my eyes to this movie. Some of the ""Show me how to live"" music video contains footage and/or ideas from ""Vanishing Point"". The VHS was hard to find, and a DVD didnt even exist - until now. So, if you're a muscle car fan, or an Audioslave fan, you're gonna want to check this out. And while you're at it - go buy ""Bullit"" too."
4,"Also look for the ""book end"" to Vanishing Point","Barry Newman found a fan with Vaninshing Point, but there is another film by him that also has excellent stunt work ( and an early appearance of Ben Kingsley) that was made at about the same time. Check out FEAR IS THE KEY...Newman wears the same blue denim outfit and attitude...and the plot makes sense! These movies are perfect for fans of either one."
4,intreague,"sure not the greatest movie in the world, but as a cult classic its a must have and worth a watch every now and then. Also a good note is the style of filmography used, an interesting movie and a great car."
4,Vanishing point,Excellant car film. Great car chase and driving.Also a hint of sadness and lost hope.
4,one of the greatest car movies of all time,"Lots of great chase scenes, and action. This movie shows the spirit of the American Muscle car."
5,One of the best,Still a great film after all these years. Hope Dodge make the new Challenger in white
4,"Incredible chase movie, the best!","Originally saw this movie on television in the early 80's, a very impressionable time for me in my young teens. Prompted me to buy my own 1970 Dodge Challenger, which I still own. That aside, the film work is extremely well done. Chase and stunt scenes are about the best ever scene on film. The Bullit chase scene was hailed as the best, but this movie blows it away!(Actually the stunt coordinator and driver is the same in both movies, Carrie Loftin) You can make this movie as deep or as shallow as you wish, either way it is a great movie! Fox did a television remake of this film in 1997 which did not do this film justice in any way. Get the original!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Classic chase film, though a bit cheesy","First of all, I want to say I really liked this film for what it was: a car chase film, show-casing domestic muscle cars, a shallow plot, and contemporary music. Its not a great movie when it comes to the storyline, but the action scenes are great, especially if you're a fan of muscle cars and rebellion. Anyways, the vehicle used in this movie, a 1970's Dodge Challenger, is a thunderous symbol of the power inherent in the American spirit of rebellion that hearkens back to the revolutionary war."
4,It was good movie,I bought it cause they were talking about it in the recent Grind House movie that came out in spring of 2007.
3,Vanishing Point,"This movie is at a slow pace for the first half hour, even with car chases that are monotonous. In order for Vanishing Point to work as a good time passer, I would recommend skipping the first half hour if you've already seen it before, because it's the rest of the movie that puts the pedal to the metal, and is pretty fun. Also, if you've recently caught a music video on T.V. by a group called Audioslave, for their latest single, ""Show Me How to Live,"" it is basically a shot for shot remake of Vanishing Point, narrowed down to the songs running time."
3,"the original ""Vanishing Point""","You will never find this video for rent . This uncut B movie is just as vague as I remembered it back in the ""70s"". I loved Challenger scenes shot in its raw cinematography. A must have cheesy cult classic."
1,I've seen better movies from the 30s,"The car is the star of this picture.If dialog and a good plot is what you are looking for, look elswhere.And the ending... It's just as bad as this here review.It's a good thing Smokie And The Bandit was such a huge success in 77, after leaving the audience hanging for 2 long years, it was a well deserved joy ride."
1,A movie that glorifies stupidity!,"I can't think of one redeeming part of this movie but then I never did dope. I never was a big fan of the flower children. Glorifying someone who is putting people's lives at risk and popping pills is just stupid. If I ever wondered, how do you make a boring car chase movie, this movie answers the question."
5,A House Divided,"The film ""A House Divided"" is comparable to an excellent television movie. Half of it is a courtroom drama, and the other half is a family drama that centers on a white master, the slave he rapes, and the child that is the result. It is performed convincingly and movingly by all the actors, both principal and secondary. I don't understand why it is not available in DVD. It is, in my opinion, a movie worth owning. For more information on the Dickson family, read the book upon which the film is based."
4,Felt Mountain & Black Cherry brought to life!,"Both concerts provide a heavenly slice of Goldfrapp. Although not a big fan of the material from Black Cherry, I reveled in the sound of Felt Mountain brought to deliciously detailed life. Both concerts have the same general feel, so I feel that perhaps this might have been made better by including the promo videos for the respective songs.The bonus material of the interviews and such give a well-rounded view of where Ms Goldfrapp is coming from.One thing I hardly mention about other items, deserves attention here... and that is the packaging. The physical packaging is slick and candy-like. The DVD menus themselves are works of art.Altogether a DVD worth the price for any Goldfrapp fan."
2,"Ridiculously slow, weird design","This model is [not very good] for a Mac, and alas, you get what you pay for. It feels slow and the lack of expansion is already proving a headache for me. I also don't like the design. If I were to pay for a computer myself, I'd stick with a Windows PC for better performance, wider software selection, and better tech support -- all for a lower price."
5,Great Machine for the Money,"This is a fantastic machine for the money. It is fast and efficient and runs beautifully. I don't find the fan to be annoying at all. It can actually be quite soothing while I work and turns off when you put the machine to sleep. I would definitely recommend buying with more memory. I bought mine with 512MB, but be sure to start with at least 256MB.If you want a mac (G4) and are on a budget, this is the machine for you."
2,Display Problems!!!,"I too had major display problems (as with every single one I've seen). In higher resolutions, the screen jiggles/dances/shakes - look in the corners...not to mention after only 5 days it wouldn't work at all. I sent it in to an apple store for repairs (entire crt replaced), got it back one week later and the screen still shakes. In fact, I checked EVERY in-store emac I've seen and they all do it- even in the apple store. My guess is that they aren't properly magnectically sheilded and over sensitive to electrical wiring. Apple said for me to get it fixed again and told me this was an isolated incident!!!. Plus, where is the mic jack?"
3,Ewokes revisted,I think this movies was much better when I was younger but being a fan of the 80's movies it is still a great movie to have.
5,a childhood favorite,"i was so psyched when i found this! i grew up watching this as a kid, and eventhough it wasnt as entertaining as it was when i was a kid (not many are, lol) it was still just a good family movie. i invited some friends over and we watched the movies one night and laughed about the things that we thought were so great, and at the actual comedy in the movie itself. all in all, i am glad that i bought it and will have it for my children to watch one day!"
4,Fun For The Younger Star Wars Fan,"Got this movie for my son's Birthday, because he is Star Wars obsessed. He has been watching the ""real"" movies with my husband sitting next to him covering his eyes at the scary parts. I wanted something Star Wars that he could watch without having to worry about that. These are still a bit darker than I would have liked. The 1st movie of the two has at least a redeeming plotline. But I was disturbed by the death of three of the main family members at the beginning of the 2nd movie. It doesn't seem to have disturbed my son, but it bothered me as being a bit unneccesary for a young person's film. My son seems to enjoy both films a lot and has watched them both a few times each. He likes the 1st one featuring the older brother best. Anyway, they may not be on the same caliber of the ""real"" movies, but for my son they work just fine."
3,The Forgotten Star Wars Movies,These are long forgotten movies. I played these to my niece and nephew and they loved them. The acting is a little rough and dated and the Ewok suits leave a lot to be desired but kids love these movies.
5,Great Memories,"Wow, I am so excited that this movie is coming out on DVD. I grew up watching this movie and loved it-I played the VHS till it wore out. It was made in the 80's so the effects aren't like they are now days, but that's the good part. It's a movie that I want to share with my kids!"
4,Brings back memories,"I remember watching these on tv. One of them was even simulcast on the radio. We taped them off the tv and was just talking about throwing them out when my parents move b/c the tape is old & probably no good after sitting in the bbasement all these years. Can't believe they are on dvd. I just ordered and can't wait for it to come. I'd watch it right now if I had it. Yeah it was made for kids but I'm just a taller kid. It brings back memories. It you like the ewoks in Return of the Jedi but don't think they got enough screen time, you'll like these movies. And you don't have to fast forward through commercials."
4,$124.99? Are you serious?,"I love these movies. I am working on upgrading my VHS tape collection to Blu-Ray/DVDs. However, I think I might just hang on to the VHS tapes here for a while. While I love these movies, I am not willing to pay over $100 even if it is a double feature! These should be no more than $20. Therefore, I am going to hang on to the VHS tapes and watch those instead for now, until some people can figure out that some of us aren't willing to be suckered into paying all of that! How greedy can you people be?"
5,Best classic,These are great movies that really bring back memories. They are great for the whole family. I never get tired of watching these movies. They are classic!!
2,wow,my favorite part of the movie is when the ewok goes to the supermarket and when he arrives at home he finds his ewok wife in bed with another ewok.
1,it should been reamastered,i am a star trek but i rember watching ewok movie i w3as child in the 1980's. i think could of remastered the this two movie like the first movie of star wars or star trek tos remastered i hate duel disc format os the could of both movie on one disc without filp dvd over. they need to some speical feautres on disc.
1,The irritating little possesed teletubbies,"So I've watched the first one.Some boy who thinks he's a hero and abunch of teletubies with red eyes.The girl was the only decent one,but all she said was ""Mace,mace,mace."" I know George Lucas wasn't a director.I double-dared my mom to watch the second one, but she said no.I regret watching it.It's one of the movies that someone has to pay you for you to watch it.This one's worse than Cat in the Hat"
3,Still good for the kids!,"I bought this DVD because I remembered watching Caravan of Courage a long time ago as a child and haven't seen the movie since. Couldn't even find it in local video stores. I was wondering why couldn't they show it on TV again (Star Wars is shown on TV practically every year). Therefore I was thrilled to see it on Amazon and decided to get it.Maybe because I have grown and don't find the movies on this DVD as exciting anymore, but I guess it was fun seeing it again. I bought this DVD a year before my son was born. So now there's a reason to keep this DVD, it's for him to watch as he grows up and hopefully gets all excited about Ewoks and Star Wars like me when I was a child."
3,blue harvest title,"to the fella that mentioned blue Harvest--that was the code title for Return of the Jedi when they were filming it on location, so fewer lookie-loos would be aware they were filming a star wars movie."
5,Sweet movies,"I saw these movies years before I actually saw the original Star Wars trilogy. My parents thought Star Wars was too graphic for me, but decided to let me watch Ewoks. I loved those movies so much, even as a child I managed to find out when they would show again and recorded them myself onto tapes. I still have those tapes, but more importantly the memories of being taken away into a fantastical world where cute little creatures had to stand up to evil.Definitely recommended for parents looking for GOOD children's movies. 5/5 for perfect family fun."
3,One for the kid in you,Reading through all these people bashing these movies has me shaking my head. Really what can you expect out of television movies about Ewoks? To criticize these movies as being too childish is like criticizing the smurfs for being blue.These movies were made for kids and not the people like me who saw the original STAR WARS movies in the theater as a kid but are now in their 30s. Really though to be able to get two movies on DVD for about half the price of a tank of gas to me sounds like an okay deal. People really should lighten up and take into account the audience these TV movies were made for.One bright spot in these movies are some quite ambitious special effects (for TV at least).
4,Ewoks Unite!,"Finally both classic TV shows on one great disc. Now the Ewok adventures can be enjoyed by a whole new clan of Star Wars fans. This single DVD has interactive menus and contains an entire feature on each side. (one note of correction, the liner notes indicates which side the movies are listed on, but on the actual DVD the movies are on opposite sides)Special effects are decent, acting and script are as best as can be expected from a TV show made years ago, but c'mon it's a Lucas original story and it has...Ewoks in it!!!This DVD makes a nice addition to any Star Wars collection."
3,Star Wars Ewok Adventures Caravan of Courage / The Battle For Endor,classic kids / familey movies or for any star wars fan.
4,Almost perfect,Arrived on time. Disk in good shape. Played well. Plastic label on box was a bit wrinkled on the top edge and there was some stick residue from the original price sticker and security tape. But over all it was in nice shape.
4,received in timely manner,"This is a movie I purchased because I remembered loving it as a child. I let my 7 year old watch it, and he was SCARED out of his wits!! It wasn't as great as I remembered, but still fun to bring back the memories. May be a little too scary for little ones!!"
4,"a wonderful coloring book, too","This slender, inexpensive book is a fine look at Klee's exquisite line (a point out for a walk). If you use it as a coloring books, you'll learn a lot about color, too.Bob Rixon"
1,Don't bother with this one!,If you've already watched the 3rd installment then there's no point in buying this DVD. It does have many extra's but nothing worth raving over. I didn't watch the series and so I sat down to watch this DVD and they tell you right at the start who wins it! WHY???
4,Pretty good,"The only reason I gave 4 stars on this is because of that annoying Marcellas being on this season.If there was a way to delete him from my TV screen, I would be happy.Great season, otherwise."
4,One of the Better Seasons,"This was a good Big Brother season with lots of interesting characters and a lot of unexpected twists. It ranks just below Season 2 with evil doctor Wil(which strangely has not been released). Though it contains all 32 episodes, there are no extras aside from audition tapes. It would have been nice to get commentary, or updates on the people. Or they could have given uncensored bits. Still it is worlds better than the abbreviated version of Season 4. The packaging is not the best and there is a good chance the dvd's could come loose in transit. Also, the Amazon price is crazy. I got my set at Overstock for just over $20. Hopefully they release the other seasons."
2,Shady,"Although this was a great season of Big Brother, the DVD edition leaves much to be desired. The ONLY extra features are boring audition tapes of the houseguests to be and the DVD set is of very poor quality. There are no scene selection or language options, nor is there subtitling. The episodes themselves appear exactly as they did on TV, with language and nudity censored. No deleted scenes (these people were taped 24/7, I'm sure they could have come up with SOMETHING), NOTHING! This DVD set seemed to me like a bootleg someone burned at home. The packaging is also terrible.The set is worth having if only to relive this great season, but if you are a DVD buff and look forward to those features prominantly found in DVD box sets, you will be sorely disappointed. Absolutely nothing new of any worth to see."
1,Where are the rest?,"What good is a DVD set with only the first 4 episodes? I assume the others will come out later (or not, if this one doesn't sell), but then we have to spend MORE money.The reviews for the Big Brother 4 DVD indicate that Season 4 is only 2 discs, featuring highlights only.Why can't CBS put out a COMPLETE SET of at least ONE season? Also, don't they realize that the true fans want everything? That includes ALL the episodes AND some uncensored clips as well."
5,Enter the world of a toddler with this book!,"All four of my cildren have LOVED this book! It goes through various aspects of a toddler's world, from ""wake-up time"", geting dressed,pretend, and uses MANY phrases these dear little ones say frequently at this age. My favorite is """" I did it! By self!"" What parent hasn't heard that one a hundred times! It encourages that healthful independence that emerges in this period of development and covers family,friends, leter, numbers, colors and more! This book focuses on the joyful part of being a toddler! I had to search high & low to get a new copy, because our old one is hanging on by a thread. Hopefully, there will be more books printed for you to share with YOUR toddler!"
3,Jury Is Still Out On Replacement Of Original Reviver,"The original Olay Firming Reviver Body Lotion was ""new"" only a few months ago when I bought the product. Since then, it has been replaced with the ""Quench"" brand. I have checked the ingredients of the new brand against the old and they are for the most part the same. The new ""Quench"" brand does not, however, have all the ingredients that the old lotion did. It also seems a little bit stickier, less absorbent than the original. I have only used the new product twice since receiving it, so I am loath to give it any more than 3 stars without a more thorough vetting. I will have a better opinion of it in a few more weeks."
3,Yuck!!,"Dont like, it has a dry consistency and the flavor needs something extra... havent figured out what that is yet!! I will be stacking these up in my cabinet until someone else wants them"
1,Yuk,"This tomato basil flavor is weird. It does not work at all with tuna. I bought these months ago and I still have several in the pantry. My husband will tolerate them, otherwise I would have tossed them already.... That just gave me an idea. I will give them to the local food pantry."
4,On the go goodness,Great idea and great flavor. Makes a much healthier snack at work than a bag of doritos. I will definitely order the 12 pack. I have not tried the other flavors but I would definitely recommend the sun-dried tomato and basil.I was not a fan of the crackers but it is still a good product that offers long term storage. I prefer a thin cracker but everyone has a preference.
5,Good quality product,I've had this for over a year and it seems very solid. It's a good quality product.
2,Not a true 10ft wide....,"The item is not a true 10ft in width! For my project, I put some up as vapor barrier on to a basement wall.Haven't seen if the end of the roll is wider, but the beginning 13 feet I used for my project was 'AT LEAST' 3 inches short of 10 feet in width. Not acceptable.... It either is or isn't 10 ft wide... period.Also - The item is heavy. The roll product box was packaged in another Amazon box with minimal brown paper stuffing. Well - The shipment arrived all smashed... to the point the product box was nearly unusable to easily dispense from. I had to re-tape it up to hold together. During transit, the product box just totally crushed another item in my shipment too. Not sure why they shipped the items together like they did. Poor decision. Not good on any level..."
5,From Spencer's Mom,This delightful book is beautifully illustrated and makes us laugh everytime we read it!
4,sweet doggie thoughts,"Great Dane Savannah Blue is all of two years old, & lives in a house of girls. When her human's niece comes for a vacation, Savannah Blue & Calla Roo get along just fine. When her new friend has to go back home, Savannah Blue becomes blue.Then her human suggests she write to Calla Roo, to keep in touch, & this is Savannah Blue's first letter.DEAR CALLA ROO...LOVE, SAVANNAH BLUE is a little too sweet for me, although I enjoyed Sudie Rakusin's energetic illustrations.If you are a dog-lover & want to introduce the inner life of dogs to your children, then it will be just your cup of tea."
5,From Spencer Larson,"This book makes me jiggle, wiggle and giggle a lot. I love Stinky Pinky and Soodle Doodle."
1,Returned within a week,"POOR quality product, we returned it after one week, rust formed all over and whistle gadget just fell off.It's pretty dangerous I have a small kid that drinks that water, its good I saw it - he could just swallow it.I can't believe this thing hasn't been yanked off the market.I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,No Help,"I was excited when I came across this book on Amazon. I'm a third year architecture student and was hoping to increase my model-making speed/technique. I thought I could find a few pointers in this book but I am honestly sorry to say that it was not a help at all. VERY basic techniques are presented in this book and unless you have never made a model in your life, I don't think you would get much out of this one. I will say that the book looks nice. So, if you're a complete beginner it might help you out but if you've been building models for some time I would not get it.Anyone have any suggestions for some more advanced books?J"
3,"Worth ten bucks, but pretty low hanging fruit","This how to book does not really explain much, or show much, no photos, just drawings. It sort of explains how to do stuff with different materials, but not really. I keep it on my shelf, and occassionally look at it while working on models, but it doesn't really come in handy. If you have never made a model, this may not explain enough to you, if you are really advanced, this may not explain enough."
2,Not for casual beginners,"The book was not detailed enough, but it had some very insightful tips. All the pictures were hand drawn. I wouldn't recommend it for beginners. If you are causal beginner, you might try something SIMILAR to a Warhammer Terrain how-to book (table top games would be too specific). Something like that would have more step by step photographs and detailed instructions for making models."
3,"Good entertainment for the rest of the country, but for North Dakotans...","This movie is good entertainment for the rest of the country, but as a North Dakota native, the movie is a farce as far as the facts of the case are concerned. The movie also portrays rural North Dakotans as small-minded, racist morons which I didn't appreciate at all (for instance, the man in the trailer using the words ""what in tarnation!).However, a good movie as far as movies go with a first rate cast."
5,Required reading for all photographers,"Anyone who sets foot in a darkroom should read this book. A little scary at times, but information you need to be aware of. Especially important for creative workers who often forget about the side effects of the materials they work with."
2,"can't believe the good reviews of this movie, badly acted and very corny for a gang movie...","yes, linda blair is topless in one scene, but the other women are aweful to look at. the gang warfare is nothing more than overage actors playing teenagers in high school, and fighting in the suburbs. not linda blairs best acting. hardly savage streets."
5,so very great,it came to me so perfect its just what i wanted i looked and waited to find this for years ty its wounderful
4,The ingredients,"FYI, the ingredients are90% - Water5% - Alkyl* dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride *(41%C14, 28%C12, 19%C18, 12%C16)Other - Alkyl* dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride *(55% C16, 27% C12, 16% C14, 2% C18)"
3,Should have been more careful.,"I have never ever bought this product online. I usually get it at Bed, Bath and Beyond but they seem to think that an air cleaner is a seasonal item so they don't stock it after the winter season. So with nowhere else to go I decided to give Amazon a try. Well, too bad for me that I assumed that the product would be the same size that I purchase at the local store. I had thought that I would receive the 35 oz bottle and I was sent the 17.5 oz bottle. Not only that, I had to pay more that what would be half price. I also had to pay almost $7 shipping and handling. You can be sure that I'm going to stock up in the fall with enough to last a full year and I will be buying it at the Bed, Bath and Beyond store nearby."
5,Very good.,I like the size it will last for a good while considering i used to buy individual packets and by the end of the season i was all out. Works very well with our Venta humidifier/purifier.
4,Does its job,This water additive does it job of keeping dirt and hard water lime etc afloat in the water and making it easier to maintain the Venta humidifier/air washer. It was promptly delivered at a price lower than I can buy it locally.
4,Venta Water Treatment,"I have used this product for several years, and it is required by the manufacturer to maintain the 10 year warrenty. The product works well and the price was right."
5,Venta Airwasher Water Treatment,"We use this water treatment product routinely - every three weeks or so when our Venta Humifier is in use. It does a good job of dealing with the mineral deposits from our water and prevents us from doing a complete cleaning frequently. In fact, we only needed to use the cleaner after two years of regular use."
3,purchases,"I have had very good experience with all of my orders from Amazon. They have arrived within a reasonable time period and have been in very good condition, the same as depicted, whether used or new. So far I have no complaints or suggestions."
4,Best way to keep your venta clean,"this keeps minerals and impurities from building up on the airwasher drum and is easy to use and long-lasting, too."
5,great short fiction you'll want to read til the end,I loved this book. Once i picked it up i didn't put it down until it was finished. I'm going to read this one a few times before it makes it to the shelf i believe.
5,good service,The book that I purchased arrived on time if not a little earlier than expected and in good condition
4,These bowls rock!,"These lightweight (though NOT flimsy) bowls are very attractive and seem quite well-made. This set offers a great assortment of sizes for limitless uses in the kitchen. The only reason they're not getting 5 stars is that the lids get a little ""bendy"" after a run through the dishwasher. This doesn't affect their ability to fit (they fit great, actually), but makes them a tad more difficult to STORE since they don't lay perfectly flat. (Probably the lids should be hand washed anyway...but I detest hand washing, so I'll live with the undulations)."
5,These are a best buy,"For the price, these bowls are a best buy. You get the Revere name and quality. The rings and covers are definately handy. Anyone who got covers that were cracked or didnt fit received a defective set. I did a lot of searching and you cant even find one bowl for the price that you get all these three for."
2,Not what I was expecting,"These bowls are much, much smaller than I was expecting. I only looked at the picture and didn't pay attention to the dimensions given (I know, my fault). Please be aware that the picture makes these bowls appear much larger than they actually are!"
4,Good basic set in great shape for over 20 years!,"I have read some of the reviews and wonder what ever happened to the quality Revere used to employ? What is the problem with the lids?I've had this same set for over 20 years and they are still in great shape although I have lost a lid, and they are used often.The only reason it doesn't get my 5th star is that they didn't have that rubber bottom the new Oxo brand bowls have. But other than that, there are no complaints."
4,great customer service,"These mixing bowls arrived with the lid to the middle-sized bowl full of cracks, and basically useless. An email to Revere, though, led to an immediate replacement of the defective product. Otherwise, the mixing bowls are of good quality."
2,Buyer Beware,"I took a chance even after reading the previous reviews regarding the cracked lids. After two shipment with the cracked lids, Amazon would not send a third. I contacted Revere and they were not able to help. The product is no longer available to them nor are just the the lids available. I would still like the product and don't understand why Amazon cannot open and check the lids before packing and sending them. If you have any doubt, don't waste your time with this product."
2,World Warped 3 Live,This was just not what I was looking for but it did not hurt to explore this CD to find out.
1,Kindle Version,"Kindle version is awful. Missing lots of text. Unbelievable that they think they can SELL something this horribly edited.Amazon, FIX YOUR PRODUCT."
2,Bad OCR,"Let me start first by saying I have no problem with the content of the book. I use it as a (mandatory) study book for Church History in my MDiv of Theology. It clearly sets out the thoughts, theology and backgrounds that prevailed during past times.But it seems that this ebook has been OCRed without any further review. Incorrect punctuation, misspellings (e.g. setde rather than settle) and especially in connection with cross references parts of sentences are missing to then later find that they have been displaced up to a whole paragraph.When you want to do some concentrated reading/studying, this is not what you're hoping to see. So far I'm half way reading the book and have submitted many suggestions for correction using my computer version of Kindle. I hope they will quickly integrate these corrections and publish a new version of this ebook."
1,"Book Decent, Just do not buy on kindle.","Yesturday I purchased this item for the Kindle. I had been borrowing this book in physical form from a library for a seminary course and thought it would be nice to own. So kindle being the cheapest option for this item I went ahead and purchased it. Unfortunately the kindle edition is lacking in much and is poor quality and defective. The reason I say this because it lacks an table of contents and the possibility to navigate it properly, the same goes for the index it is unnavigatable. This I was willing to live with but I started noticing errors in the text of the book, errors where there should be greek words, now if they would have transliterated the words I would have been ok with it but that wasn't what was done. It is a poorly designed ebook, so please do not buy the kindle edition."
3,Not Bad for the Price,"This is a decent drawing board and portable, which is what I needed. But it said that it came with a folder or something on the back side, mine did not. It also didn't come with a rule - although the hardware for it was there. It's just a board with feet that tilt it up, if that's what you need, go for it."
4,Good Trike,"We recently bought this for my 2 year old. He is about the size of a 3&1/2 year old, so this might be a bit big for other kids his age. I like that it converts, though he doesn't seem to like the ""lowrider"" option. However, he does love riding this tricycle by both pushing with his feet and pedaling. It can be a bit stiff from him to steer, but my biggest complaint is that it doesn't have a push handle for the accompanying adult. My husband found out that a detached broom handle works fairly well (but it looks weird when I'm not pushing the bike....walking around with a long stick). Overall a good bike."
3,Looking for good bike for my 2year old son,Researching on this model and found that 2 users(1 user in amazon and another one in Target )have complained about the front wheel wear and tear.From their reviews.. it looks like a design flaw.. when converted to a cycle the center wheel is off the center and hence the wear and tear on one side..-Alex
1,DANGEROUS!!!,"Parent's please be careful! We got this trike for our daughter for her 3rd birthday ans I was so excited for her to use it... Well when she got on the trike, and was just sitting there, the trike proceeded to tip over- causing my daughter to fall off and bust her lip open. Not exactly a great way to celebrate your birthday! I ended up taking her to the ER because I couldn't tell where the blood was coming from at first and wasn't sure if the fall had knocked a tooth loose. Thankfully she was wearing a helmet and was ok- just a big hole in her lip. Take it from me- search for a better (safer) trike!"
3,Trike caused unexpected injuries,"My son loves this trike, however after converting it to a trike and adjusting the seat back and forth between the 3 available positions, he began complaining that it was hurting his lower back, he asked me to take the seat off, the next morning I discovered while giving him his bath that he had 3 nasty looking bruises on his lower back from the seat rest. Just something everyone should be aware of."
4,Trike,"We sent this to our 2 year old grandson in California. His father assembled it for him (with his help, of course)... the Trike looks like a lot of fun, unfortunately our little grandson cannot reach the pedals at this time. He promised to grow into it... then I'm sure it will be lots of fun for him!!"
5,Step 2 Naturally Playful Lookout Treehouse,"First of all,the price was very competitive and arrived when they said it would. Very easy to assemble and set up. All we have to do now is sit and watch my grandson play on it. It also appears to be a very safe toy to play on. We will definetly use Amazon.com for purchasing future toys."
4,My little guy loves this!!!,"my husband and I got this item for my little boy's 1st birthday. He loves it!! It is a little bit smaller than I thought it would be, so it is perfect for him (He is a big 1 year old)."
4,Setp 2 Treehouse Review,"Purchased for 2 year old grandson. When product arrived, some parts were scuffed and scratched and all parts bags were opened. It appeared to have been used or possibly returned maybe???? All parts needed were present so we assembled and kept it, althought I was dissapointed at condition of the item, my grandson was so excited I didn't have the heart to send it back. I was offered and accepted a partial refund of $37.00."
4,Weeee!,"My daughter is pretty adventurous. This was sooo great from one year to about 16 months. After that the short little slide was not so exciting for her. It's well built and sturdy, but not sure, for us at least, it was a good value since she lost interest so quickly."
4,Good starter set,"But my 13month old needs new stuff to stay occupied, so we have boutht more items to add to this. But it was a great start. Only thing I did think was the stapes were rather steep"
5,TERRIFIC TODDLER TREEHOUSE,BEST VALUE FOR YOUR BUCK !!! GRANDCHILD IS 2 YEARS OLD & DOES NOT WANT TO LEAVE THE TREEHOUSE FOR ANY REASON !!! LOOKED @ SEVERAL DIFFERENT STYLES AND SIZES (WANTEDA CLIMBING TOY W/SLIDE AND SOME KIND OF BOX OR HOUSE FOR BABY TO SIT IN)-FOR THE$$$ PRICE YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG W/THIS TOY.
1,Grinch! Ruined Xmas!,I've ordered this for my girl for xmas and my husband was assembling just to find out we CAN'T because of MISSING PARTS! What do I tell my daughter? Santa brought you a bunch ofplastic parts?
4,Not to shabby!,"My boy is 17 months and plays a little on it. I like that it is easy to clean and light enough to move around the yard, into the shade if needed. Price was acceptable also."
5,Wonderful!,This product is really great for my 15 month old as well as my 6 year old! It's a great way for my 6 year old to entertain the baby while mama's in the kitchen cooking dinner!
5,Best First Playhouse,This is a great starter house for my son. It was very easy to put together and looks just like the picture. I would for sure buy more products made by this company!
4,My little guy loves it,"My 15 month old loves this toy. It is definitely more suited for 18 months+ like the instructions say, but he can manage just fine with help. Right now his favorite part is the periscope. All in all I'm happy with my purchase and I'm happy that he can grow into it."
1,sent back,"Sent it back after our year old grandson stood up in the landing and his head just about touched the roof, so did not think he would be using up to five years as stated."
5,Excellent!,Much easier to assemble than other toys we have purchased! LOVED by my grandchild!!! This will last him for several years!
1,ARRIVED USED!!!! SHAME ON YOU AMAZON,"SO disappointed in Amazon for sending me a USED PRODUCT.The slide has long gouge marks on it and other pieces also have marks on them.It is CHRISTMAS, thanks for ruining it for us.TOTAL RIP OFF- DO NOT PAY THIS PRICE!"
4,Good for little kids,"This is an excellent indoor slide if you are looking for something for your little ones to do in cold winter months. It is a small slide, takes up very little space, and the tree house is perfect for play. I bought it for my 18 month old son and he has had much fun using it. His friends of up to 7 years old have played on it and it has lasted many children's parties. I plan to move it outdoors in the Spring."
2,toddler climber too small,We bought this for our one year old granddaughter. She may be on the tall side but she already is too tall to stand on the top landing and it was supposed to be for 18 months to 3 years. Also the ladder is not designed well-nothing to hold on to as the child climbs up. The reviews were pretty good but I am dissapointed that she won't be able to play on it for very long.
1,Leaves For The Ranking,"I remember this mans wife was in my writers group and had a friend of mine editing this book, then she she tried to stiff my friend and not pay her and took it for someone else to edit. We saw her one day after the book was published and she was going on and on what a great new editor they got and what a wonderful job he did, we opened the book and first thing we see on the title page were the words ""LEAVES FOR THE RANKING."" I will never forget that, As far as the book goes, I dont know, might be great but I have never read it and never intend to."
3,The Girl from Sin/Henry's Night In,"Both movies are a bit cheesy, but if you are a fan of busty women and vintage films, then this is a must see movie. I like the special features the most!"
2,Disappointment,"The publisher has changed the format from 3 strips per page to a mere 2 and also deleted the ""intro"" gags that usually appear in the first panel or two of the Sunday strip (some papers omit these as well). So you are getting less for your money. I am not buying this book to send a message to the publisher that this practice is not acceptable. If you really want to relive Andy-Grinch, Andy's mom at Thanksgiving, and other antics, spend 20 minutes browsing in a bookstore."
2,If you like receiving less for paying the same price...,"I have been a long-time follower of Foxtrot, and have all the collections, including this one. Death By Fieldtrip saw the change in format from 3 strips per page to 2, and even though the humor remains top-notch, the new format is EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. I refuse to support a publisher who chooses to punish loyal readers by offering less for the same price, and will not be buying any more collections in the future."
3,"Many Laughs, but Minute Viewing","Once again, Bill Amend has wowed us with his funny Fox family antics. If it's not Jason seeking to wreak havoc upon Paige, then it's Roger coming up with some hairbrained idea, or Andi freezing the whole family with her lowly maintained thermostat. This book, like his countless others, is loads of fun. It is sad to see that the book has become horizontally challenged with its smaller size. The books are just not the same without their colored pages and three and four strips a page! That is why I give the book a three on the sizing scale. Hopefully the demise of Amend's books will end with his next project. Let's hope that will happen real soon!"
3,"Good, but not one of Fox Trot's best","This is a very funny book, including the sequences where Andy Fox is the Grinch and when Jason wakes up to discover he's a ""mini-Paige"". However, the format of this book is different than the others. There are only 2 weekly strips per page, and the book is shorter than Amend's others. I did enjoy this book and I would recommend it to others, but I doubt it will be one of my all-time Fox Trot favorites."
2,Value wise - its a rip,"Quality of the subject, art aside - do not buy this book. Why? Wait for it to appear in a collection. This book is the size of a garfield book. Two strips to a page. Less pages then before. Guess he is not making enough money off us. Wait for the collection if you can. If you cannot - its fun to read."
5,couldnt put it down!,Bill Amend rules almost as much as Quincy! [read the book to find out whos quincy]
3,Screwed up description and Model # of product,"The picture shown is of Designers Edge E-231 which is a 20 foot long 16/3 gauge cord. This is what I was sent. Since I was looking for a product like the picture, BUT with a 25 foot long cord, I'm disappointed. It would have been perfect if the length in the description matched the product. Everything else works as expected."
1,Doesn't deserve the Corelle name,Earthen ware junk that doesn't deserve the Corelle name. Very disappointing.
1,DO NOT BUY BREAKABLE ITEMS FROM AMAZON,"In the last year of ordering correlle abundance dishware as gifts for my mother in law from Amazon, they have managed to pack absolutely nothing securely. The latest blunder being the packaging of a ceramic baking set, which they dropped in to a cardboard box and applied one thin sheet of styrafoam packing. Getting this item replaced has been a 3 month nightmare, ending with Amazon telling me sorry for the trouble we can't meet our obligation to you, here's your money back. 100% unacceptable from a retailer who use to carry such high standards in customer service."
3,sturdy,These are very nice sturdy bowls but the first set came shattered. I reordered and although they came unbroken I was surprised. the packaging is not good.there was a couple pieces of bubble wrap in the box and the bowls can move around. They are nice heavy bowls. The box said they are oven proof although i've not tried it yet. I would recommend them if you can get a set unbroken...
2,Not even remotely,"The first reviewer went into such paroxysms of rapture for this CD that I broke my rule and ordered this CD on the basis of someone whose opinions were untested. Sergei Edekmann turns out to be a typical Russian competition winner, possessing a big, extroverted technique that attempts to out-Gilels Gilels. But the interpretations here are rudimentary and crude, and RCA's sound is hard and clangy. There was little to enjoy, in short."
4,Don't go to Italy without this book.,"Here's the book you need to explore Italian cities on foot and maximize your travel experience. Detailed maps and directions help you get from point A to B to C etc, seeing all the key places in a logical sequence. The day trips are organized to get you to the attractions at the best times and avoiding crowds. The book could use better quality images and color. Still, it's a must for travelers."
4,Daytrips Italy,"Your 4th edition of ""Day Trips Italy"" wasmy constant companion in my recent tripto Italy. I used Florence as my base city for daytrips to Siena, Greve in Chianti and San Gimignano.You asked your readers to send any comments.Page 123, you write regarding the Torre del Mangia in Siena's Piazza del Campo:""the incomparable view presents a dramatic panoramaof the medieval city."" You are so correct !!!!Thanks again for your guide.My next base city will be Venice, as I explore North East Italy.-submitted to Hastings House/Daytrips Publishers on Dec. 13, 2001"
1,Exactly what I expected,Being able to purchase a 50# bag of dogfood from Amazon is worth it's weight in gold. Not having to lug it out of the store it great! The bag was in perfect condition when it got to us.
1,recalled batch,"Yup, got the rebate coupon so I am happy.It is very rare they would miss testing like that and their source is the main one for most of the brands available so what do you do. Gosh!Sorry to anyone who did not see the recall. Get info by googling maybe."
1,Price gouging???,"I just came on to re-order this item for my dog, and it seems that this vendor has doubled the price! Really?"
1,RECALL WARNING,"Just purchased 40 lbs. of this product, and less than a week later, found out via another company that this food is recalled, if the product code on your bag states best used between 12/09/12 and 04/07/13 and there is either a 2 or 3 in the ninth position of the product code number and an X in the tenth position, then your food is recalled. . Different brand names are involved for both cats and dogs. Both my dog and cats turned up their noses to this food, now I know why. SMART......... animals. Supposidly dry food only is involved in this recall. Possible Salmonella problem.See www.diamondpetrecall.com for more info. on other brands involved."
2,Cheese Whiz,"All old music mixed by C-Wiz. I bought the explicit version of this CD and #9 was a clean version. This song was ruined. I'm pissed, 3-6 should never release a clean version. And #13 is all jacked off in its grill, this mix is horrible. Other than that it is a ok mix tape."
3,A bit dated,"This CD player probably isn't even made any more; I've been using it about a year and a half.As a DJ tool, it is indespensible. The quality of the effects is high, the jog wheels are very responsive, and pitch control faders are still in good shape after 1.5 years of moderate-heavy use.Biggest drawback = the effect and cue control buttons are not quite real-time and are squishy-soft. I would not buy it agian for this reason because it makes live performance difficult. I can't mix as well on the fly as I could with an older Pioneer CD player."
5,FLOYD MEETS SABBATH,"I've just listened to the new Caustic Resin and all I can say is ""Oh my Lord""! I'm somewhat familar with the bands other works (owning both TRICK QUESTION and FLY ME TO THE MOON), but never have James, Brett, Tom and Kevin put out such an amazingly solid album. The CD has virtually no artwork or information, There aren't even any track listings (the only two tracks listed in the sleeve refer to mistakes from their last album's linear notes). And yet, the sound is awesome. Varying from far off, velvet tunneled acoustic pieces to straight out stoner/psychedelic tracks that hark back to Pink Floyd's MEDDLE days, the progression of songs keeps you locked in. The heavy bass lines are layed out like thick chunks of candy, sweet as can be. If your a fan of bands like Monster Magnet, Queens of the Stone Age or Kyuss, give this album a try- you'll thank yourself in the morning."
3,Feel cheated,"I hate it when an artist doesn't trust anyone to color her creations. If you're going to color in all the parts you think ""should"" remain black, why are you making coloring books?"
2,Not much to color,"With all the shading and black areas in the coloring book, it is very difficult to actually 'color' much of anything.Also, I am not crazy about the artist's style. Theoretically, I am all for the ""Love and Accept the Body Nature Gives You"" school of thought, and this book certainly portrays women (wimmin? wimmyn? womyn? Whatever!) who are not conventionally attractive. Me, I prefer secondary sexual characteristics in my wymmin. I like curves; bosoms and hips, graceful hands and feet, feminine faces.The womyen and ghoddesses in this coloring book are all rather lumpy and mannish, with big square hands and big galumphing feet, and I don't care for them at all. Also, as I said, with all the shading, texturing, and black areas the artist has put in to the pictures, it is not very easy or satisfying to color what little *can* be colored in these unattractive pictures."
3,Review Answers,"Washcloths, come on. Babies need more than that! Maybe like bankets or a nice pillow. On the other hand washcloths with designs might be CUTE!"
2,study cards difficult and not relevant,"My daughter and a friend tried testing each other with these study cards and both of them said they had not covered any of the info during class this year. They both felt that the material was quite difficult and unfamiliar, not relevant to what their teacher is reviewing for that same exam."
2,"All murder, All ..., No fun","There goes 60 hard earned bucks down the toilet; oh!! so painful to watch!! This was second most disappointing thing i bought from the legendary Danzig the first being ""Live On The Black Hand Side."" First this band is way over rated. Glenn should have stayed with the Misfits for the time he was in Samhain; the only good disc here is Initium, and even that is kind of shotty. every song sounds exactly the same from disc to disc. The live CD is utterly horrid and hard to hear. it is said that all these discs are remastered however the sound is complete garbage. It sounds as if every album was recorded two blocks away from the studio. The discs came in thin cardboard boxes which scratch each disc. The only true gem here is the video. it is truly excellent, but not sold outside the box set. The undead (Bobby Steele's band) are better and they cant even get a good amount of CD pressings. How sad. Do yourself a favor, spend your money on something else."
5,Samhain box,"Can't believe you had a new and sealed copy of this rare box... drove myself batty trying to find it! Thank you very much, and hope to do business again sometime."
2,"Gag me, please",All this Mitchell character did was make claims and then back them up by their own philosophies. I truly gave it a chance but page after page was about themselves pumping their own grandeur.I study the art of sales and customer loyalty with respect to customer retention - but this just seemed like one big solicitation. I wasn't impressed. I actually received the book from American Express as a new year's gift and was delighted that the company sent it to me but not so much when I actually got through half of it.
1,I *used* to be a Mitchells customer,"My family shopped at Mitchells for many, many years, beginning in the 1960s. We were loyal customers - spent a lot of money at Mitchells (which once was called Ed Mitchells) - and loved shopping there.THEN, this customer-hugging family business owner changed his inventory and GREATLY raised his prices. Effectively snubbing his loyal customers of many years. It has become a joke for anyone who is not a CEO at Fortune 500 company to shop there.Granted, I have not read the book but my feeling is it is really ironic that this man would have the gall to write a book like this. Ironic and insulting."
4,valuable read for any businessperson,"Highly recommend to any businessperson as a ""how-to"" guide to differentiating yourself through service and overall attention to the customer. Much of what is written here seems like common sense (the Golden Rule: ""Do unto others..."") yet is rarely practiced by businesses. Although the book may be somewhat redundant (the reason I gave it 4 starts rather than 5), this weakness is offset by the fact that it remains a quick read, largely due to the numerous great anecdotes illustrating Mitchell's business principles. I will have all my employees read it and intend to make it one of the books that I try to re-read annually."
5,Just what I was looking for - A way to connect again and again,"As a real estate agent, I am always looking for ways to deepen a relationship. This book has spark some really creative ideas and processes/systems for me to continue to develop systems that I can create meaningful connections with my client. Woohoo! Thanks Jack Mitchell for giving me a new view!"
4,Tactical Advice for Creating a Strategic Business Advantage,"Some of the reviews cast this book as a book on customer service...but this is not so. Jack Mitchell's book is less about customer service than it is about sales. Make no mistake, Jack wants to get ALL of his customer's business. Not some, not most, but all.To do it, Jack has set up a detailed operating system to make sure all his clients are treated like princes and his very best clients are treated like kings. Jack's personal approach is time-consuming, detail-oriented and highly-effective. Showing the customer that you truly care about them and always seeking to go the extra mile creates a market differentiator for your business."
2,Good philosophy...boring read,"Liked the idea behind the book, but the execution was bad. It could have been 80 pages shorter and said the same thing. All in all....Mitchells is doing it the right way, unlike many businesses today. I hope to visit one of their stores one day."
2,Not what I expected ..,"I thought this would be great viewing for my Grandson, unfortunately it was so boring we both fell asleep, and he doesnt want to watch it anymore !!! sad really, cause his favorite thing to do is watch the planes go over, we live near an airport............"
4,Interesting for kids and adults,"I bought this DVD after my 2-year-old LOVED the ""All About John Deere Tractors Part I."" I didn't want another tractor DVD, so I switched to airplanes. It was advertised at the end of the tractor DVD and sounded great.He likes it, but not as well as the tractor DVD. I think there are two reasons why. First, he's obsessed with tractors. And the tractor DVD has catchy music, which this is more just talking.This really is a good video. Kids like it because it's airplanes. Adults like it because it includes information about all types of flying machines and the history behind them."
5,The kids loved it.,"Creative, funny, original. The kids loved it. One of my favorites for reading to my first and second grade class."
1,Don't buy,"This is a great camera, with one glaring defect! The LCD screen is not only difficult to view in sunlight -- it is impossible to view. You can't take photos in sunlight, you just point and shoot blind.This camera is so bad that Olympus either has to fix the problem, or take it off the market.The brightness of the LCD is adjustable, but you can't view the screen in sunlight no matter how you adjust it. I have tried sunglasses, but it makes the problem worse. Wearing a cap or hat will probably help somewhat, as would a black cloth draped over your head and the camera."
1,Worst customer service EVER,"I bought this ""all weather"" camera because we spend a lot of time outdoors and are boaters. The viewfinder is useless in the sun, the screen cracked from ""heat"" and was not covered under warranty I was charged $149 to repair a 3 month old camera that is only $179 new! I wrote a letter to Olympus asking why is wasn't covered and I was told because it may have cracked due to heat(sinnce I did tell thenm we used it on a boat in the summer). The manual reccomends temps under 140 degrees and I am pretty sure it wasn't anywhere near that hot!I was told that the manual only gave guidelines and they were not sure how much heat was too much heat-so not covered by warranty. I will NEVER buy another Olympus camera they are crap and the service is the worst I have ever encountered. (and it is a pain to charge the battery)"
3,Good for a small camera,"Because of its size and good battery life, the Stylus 760 is very convenient to take anywhere. The settings are easy to access and allow you to take good pictures in just about any setting. On the downside, the LCD is difficult to see in sunlight and time between pictures is excessive."
2,Disappointing,"I just wanted a camera for snapshots and candid photos, nothing fancy. I had this camera for a year, and got poor quality pictures the whole time. It was easy to use, but photos were either grainy or blurred. After consulting the manual several times, no error could be found. It was small and light, but didn't suit my needs."
5,True Tribute,"It may seem odd to honor a SoCal punk band like the Offspring with a string tribute, but i can't see a better way to pay tribute than with a genre so wildly different and unthinkable. The fact that string tribute actually works demonstrates the strength of their compositions and owes a lot to the masterful music arrangement and production. Music is about ever evolving ideas and genre bending, and musicians are supposed to take one another's music and challenge our preconceived notions. I especially recommend tracks 2 - The Kids Aren't Alright, 6 - Self Esteem and 8 - Want you Bad. The original composition - Off String, does a beautiful job of capturing the spirit the music and definitely holds its own against the other tracks. This is a must have for the true Offspring fan as well as anyone else looking for an irreverent take on this genre."
1,IT SUCKS ASS,"i hate it i hate it i hate itits dumb, it sucks, and its embarassing.This is an utter disgrace to my favorite band. How can you POSSIBLY compare orchestra to THE OFFSPRING???? Plus, the orchestra sucks. Want some offspring? buy a REAL cd!"
2,Lots of $ for a finicky product,"This scale is easily offended if you touch it wrong. I have had to pick it up, turn it over and readjust it twice (quite a process as it's very heavy) in less than two months because my housekeeper bumped it somewhat when she was dusting near it. Not what I expected at this price point. I figured it would be as sturdy as the one in my doctor's office (which is a different brand but same design). I would not purchase this brand of scale again."
5,Great scale!,I feel like I'm in control of my weight now that I have this scale. It's easy to put together and accurate. Love it!
4,works fine good price,"scale works good, consistant readings, price was good, could not get delivery info but it came soon enough to not be a bother"
4,Great scale but BIG!,"Scale and height measurement works great, but was surprised at how big it is. It will be quite prominent wherever you place it."
1,Do not recommend.,The build quality is good. Seems sturdy enough.BUT it's horribly Inaccurate. The one I received weighs light by almost 10 lbs per hundred out of the box. Verified margin using free weights and electronic scales and multiple tests. Very minor changes in weight placement shift the measured weight by several lbs. The position of your arms is enough to swing the measurement a few lbs. Move your arm forward a few inches and weight goes up move it back and it goes down.Completely useless to get any level of accuracy with.You can probably just guess your weight and get the same accuracy.
4,A Thinking Man's Mystery Novel,"Travis McGee gets a check for $25,000 (a lot of dough for 1969) and the dying wish of an old friend, to look after her suicidal daughter. So McGee goes to Fort Courtney to observe the daughter, her sister and her husband. What McGee encounters is a series of unusual circumstances, including dead bodies, cheating spouses, and the evidence that somebody is spying on him. Could all of these things be connected? Sure - but only McGee could figure out the complicated connection. True to most McGee novels, justice is served in the end, although in a form the reader does not expect.This is my 11th McGee novel. Clearly MacDonald writes in a more sophisticated style than 98% of the mystery writers today. A new reader may find it annoying that one must suffer through a good 100 pages before the action really begins, but this is typical MacDonald style. Not only do you get a complex mystery, but you get a lot of philosophy along the way."
5,My first McGee novel. A very good start!,"Well, I'll keep this short & sweet. I'm not much of a mystery reader but this series was recommended to me by several people. I picked this one randomly to start the series. I liked it...the story was quick-moving, had good character development, some humor, a lot of action, and tied up nicely at the end. At 250 pages it's a quick read, perfect for an airplane ride. If you like Dick Francis, Robert Parker, et al, then you'll like this series."
2,hard time to get done,"still reading this book, it didn't have the action that kept my attention, i keep putting it down and then reading again just to try and finish it. Maybe I should just start all over agian. :("
4,"Not flawless, but VERY good!","Ok, it is always a matter of taste. This may be not a typical B. Dearie album, wich means, you will not find a Jazz Combo. Those who are jazz buffs should start by somewhere else. But for those who enjoy traditional vocal Pop, will find these recordings very rewarding. The arrangements are a little contained, but very well designed by the master Russ Garcia, who respected the ""light"" voice of the performer, giving a non-obstructive orchestral dressing, in other words, lots of vibraphone and woodwinds. It sounds very nice. Plus, aside of the overrercorded songs like "" Guys and Dolls"", you will find some other tunes that are almost rare like Porter's ""The Physician"" and Rodger's ""Too Good For..."" . And even if you say ""not her best"" due to the bright of other recordings of her, it deserves at least four stars for its contents."
2,A Mixed Bouquet of Blossoms,Blossom Dearie has a voice that you will either like of dislike--part ingenue and part little girl. This collection has some real gems in it--her rendition of Life Upon the Wicked Stage from Showboat is delightful. Unfortinately other songs struck me as dull and listless. It is that kind of voice--at times you are drawn to it and at other times you just wonder what you are doing listening.
5,Beautiful,"When i first saw this product i had to get it. I put it on my ""to buy list"" but in just a few days the product was out of stock. As soon as it was back on the market i bought it. The shipment came fast and it was in a cute little golden box. The earrings look exactly like what the picture shows. Good quality and amazing design."
4,Lots of gloss and pretty pictures,Good coffee table book. It uses heavy weight paper and all the pages are glossy. If you are already are familiar with the Internet there is nothing that this book can tell you. If you are new to the Internet you might as well hold this book upside down. Surprisingly there are some gems in this book that are in-depth enough to be useful and colorful enough to be interesting. On page 26 they show a good rendition of the ISO network layers. On page 56 is Finding Files with Archie. Let see if you can find files with Archie. Or Veronica for that matter.
4,Pure entertainment!,"Graham Greene used to divide his novels into two categories, ""serious""novels and ""entertainments"". The Lestrade novels of J M Trow are definitely in the ""entertainment"" category. This one is first in what is a very welcome reprinting of the Lestrade series. The plot is fantastic (as in 'unbelievable') and wanders all over the country, but that doesn't matter because it is richly comical, full of in-jokes that make you feel good when you recognise them, witty puns (and some vile ones too), and a host of historical characters both real and fictional. It is a joy to read.And later volumes in the series just get better."
2,Atmospheric but Limited,"The idea of writing a series of books built around the not-so-bumbling Inspector Lestrade is somewhat clever, but MJ Trow never quite figures out how to built a mystery. There is almost no way we could ever guess the identity of the murderer as the book is full of red herrings. The atmosphere of Victorian England is recreated nicely but almost none of the characters come to life and ther are too many famous people romaing around to give the book any focus.There's just barely enough here to make me perhaps try another in the series on a lazy sumer day, but not for a while."
2,Average Regardless of the Band's Talents.,"As a fan of Funk/R&B it is sad for me to write a less than positive review of an SOS album but I am forced to do so. ""Too"" is an average album made worse by the extremely preachy tone of a couple of tracks. Producing excellent music with controversial messages was the recipe for some of the greatest albums in music history. In contrast when those messages are transmitted with average music it makes them more inflamatory (Preachy) than thought provoking. One of the highlights of the album for me was ""Do It Now"" is little more than a remix of ""Take Your Time"" which is somewhat disappointing. I do not recommend purchasing this album unless you are a die hard SOS band fan."
4,Listen to Her Voice: Women of the Hebrew Bible,"My wife and I chose this as a Bat Mitzvah gift for the daughter of Jewish friends. It was recommended by an Israeli associate. The text was well thought out and instructive for both Christians and Jews, and the classical paintings of the various women were superb. I think I want a copy for myself. I haven't heard from the recipient, so I can't say what she thought of it."
1,Deceived,I had gotten one other copyof this book in hard cover through Amazoin and expected that this copy would be the same quality. I was not told that it was a paper edition and was very disappointed in its appearance and the quality and color of the print and illustrations - altogether very bad experience.
4,Women of the Bible,"The joy of this book is not limited to finding about women in the Bible. It is quick look over the biblical history of Judaism. The mostly European artist painting renditions of these women could probably make for a good college disseration. The author first puts the biblical narrative in the story of each women and then comments on the story. Her comments are for the most part thoughtful and worthwhile reading. The author sometimes gets into the trap which says women can do no wrong, which does not serve her story well, but this is just a minor quibble."
5,A classic in a gorgeous color,"Glass bakeware is perfect. Nothing sticks to it. It goes anywhere and can be put in dishwasher, freezer, oven and on the table. The blue goes beautifully with my kitchen and is a classic color."
4,Gory crime thriller in Fulci tradition!,"Wow - a film that completely captures the gritty vibe of Italian crime thrillers (think 'Live like a cop, die like a man' & Lucio Fulci's 'Contraband'!! The violence had me looking away from the screen on many occasions. Good performances all round, with a cracking 80's synth score by Dave Andrews.The film also features Italian horror legend 'Giovanni Lombardo Radice' (Make them die slowly, Gates of Hell, Cannibal Apocalypse). A real treat for the jaded action/horror fan!I have seen on the film's official facebook page that this film is still doing the festival circuit and has won some impressive awards along the way. BEST FEATURE FILM (Germany, WEEKEND OF FEAR 2012), BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS (Brazil, CINEFANTASY).Do yourself a favor and gets this gritty slice of mayhem."
5,"Very strong, very good cord",These are great extension cords. We use them to plug in the block heaters of diesel trucks at our warehouse and need them to work when it is really cold. It hasn't gotten that cold yet but even at 15 degrees the rubber was very flexible and the trucks started right up. I will try to remember to update this and let everyone know how they made it through the winter.
3,Coleman cold weather electrical cord,this cord is no better in the cold than my regular cords but at twice the price. i would not reccomend this for cold weather
4,works great,"Works very well. The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is that I was looking for a much shorter outdoor extension cord, because I needed only five feet or so. (It was to connect my birdbath warmer to the outdoor outlet on our deck.)"
5,"Great fit, Great Leather","My husband has an old beat up brown bomber jacket and needed a hat that he could wear with it. This is the perfect hat! The leather is strong and sturdy and is a bit distressed. He's a former ball player, so he is particular about baseball hats. He loves this one! I highly recommend it."
3,Good one but a little big,"This is a great product. The leather, finish and even the price is awesome. I did not want to return it but I still did because the cap is too big to fit my small head. Got my money back within 3 days of dropping my package at FedEx and the return label was already sent with the original shipment. Man! these guys are genuine and nice. If your head is less than 23 inches in circumference you may have to use the concealed adjustment which is well designed but the only thing is it may show a little awkward from the back due to a visible fold. If your head is any smaller than 21.5 inches this is not for you.This to the company that makes this product. If you could make a smaller one, I will sure buy it and may be even advertise for you for free ;-)"
4,Excellent Quality for the Price,"I bought this hat for my Dad for Christmas. I know he's going to love it, it's so similar to the one he had and lost. My only concern is it is not adjustable. I think it will fit my Dad's head fine but I'll know for sure on Christmas. Definitely glad I bought this one over the other cheaper ones."
4,Pantech Car Charger,The car charger is very good. The price was great for a charger of this quality. The Pantech car charger was shipped fast. Great charger.
5,I recently was without electricity for a month and could not recharge my cell phone. Having this car charger will help immensly,"I plugged the cell phone car charger into my car when I left on an errand. Before I reached my destination, in less than 15 minutes, my phone was fully charged. I was the victim of Hurricane Sandy and without electricity for a month and had no way to recharge my cell phone. If I should lose power in the future, I will be able to recharge my phone now in my car. It will, indeed, be a lifesaver."
5,A must have for Classical Guitarist lovers,"A very rare recording that I wasn't aware existed, I hear that the transcriptions are out there as well and I hope they're more accessible some day. The performances are ok, it's exciting to hear this grand work on two guitars, but it's from a different era where Ramirez guitars were prominent, so that sound is not as strong in it's tone quality of each performer but Yamashita is an expert in colors and draws great orchestral color out of his instrument for this recording."
5,Great Overview,"This is a fabulous overview of death and related issues (miasma, psychopomps, ect) in Greece. It was even written in an interesting style, which is refreshing for an academic book.Originally, I took it out of the library for research on Hekate (Ms. Iles Johnson's pet subject), but I got caught up and ended up reading the whole book instead of just the chapters pertinent to my work. Fabulous. Someday, I will add it to my own library."
2,Only if you're bored,"This movie has some good things going for it. I like the concept of monsters you can see on camera but not with the naked eye and there was some good atmosphere. And Melissa Pursely looks good naked. But the plot dragged, most of the actors floundered along, and there aren't any real surprises. There are better movies to watch."
1,can't people tell when they've made a bad movie?,"this movie was not kosher with me mainly because it seemed as if the characters were improvising the script as they went along. its almost as if the director started this project soley for the purpose to see naked girls. the antogonist of the film is the drug/bdsm/blood gnome queen. she's also perpetually the antithesis of beauty. i sincerely believe rental places should pay the customers for removing the fowl stench this movie's aura places over all the movies setting around it on the shelf. as incredibly and exhaustingly consuming of your mind this is, you will feel as if you'll be looking back at the time you watched this movie while on your death bed hoping you had those two hours replaced by any memory other than this cinematic labotomy. the person responsible for this waste more than likely could have made more money selling ice cubes to eskimos."
1,THE WORST THING TO EVER GRACE THE SILVER SCREEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is quite possibly the worst thing to ever be caught on film, next to the jon bene ramsey killer made-for-tv movie. It has the worst actors that i have ever seen, and it is spawned from the worst idea ever. I dont know about the average American, but i really dont care to see bondage in the first place. Let alone, with gnomes beating up humans!! The only part of this movie that was worth while was seeing one of those things get kicked square in the junk. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!! (unless you are on something)"
1,cured me of my insomnia,"Worst movie ever made. Me and my buddies made a horror movie when we were 14 with a sony handycam and used 2 vcrs to edit in sound affects and music, and this movie here made my movie look like Will Smiths Independance Day movie..."
2,Dont be fooled by pictures,So easy to fool the buyers with good look pictures to sell theirmovies...but you were warned. The market is getting flooded bythese miniature budget movies. There should be warnings on the boxes against these wanabees.Yes i gave it 2 stars cause ive seen much worse.One star for the gnome puppets and the other one for thefree nudity.
3,Watchable Low Budget Horror,"This is an effort that aspires to be a B-movie and does a credible job of it. It is certainly well ahead of many other contenders. If this is the worst movie other reviewers have seen, then they are in for a rude shock. Blood Gnome has monsters, nudity, some good looking girls, with an appealing female lead, gore (if you're into that sort of thing, I'm not), a kinda goofy looking hero, coherent storyline, reasonably decent plot concept overall. Not many low-budget horror can claim all that. It's not Gone With the Wind, but then I never cared for Gone With the Wind -- a chick flick with hoop skirts. This is more my style, and doesn't make me want to blowtorch my eyes out during it like some Italian horror flicks. Good making of featurette, as well. Worth adding to your collection of low budget horror."
1,Unwatachably bad,This film is so bad that I couldn't even bear to watch it through. Between no plot whatsoever and acting so bad that an adult film would have rejected it there isn't a single thing to make this movie worth giving a chance.
4,don't take too seriously,I like the idea of the movie and I like Christian Slater. Not a bad plot and it moves pretty decently. If you don't take it too seriously it is not a bad movie.
1,lol alone in the dark,this movie was horrible. Besides the acting i fdont know if anyone noticed but for a covert agency they had thier name openly on everything. and that motorcross armor they were wearing to funny.
1,Perfect movie to catch up on your Z's,"Oh my God what a boring movie! The title is exactly how I found myself.... my girlfriend had fallen asleep and well I was having trouble finding interest in it. Bottom line is don't watch...buy...rent....even look at this flick. I think I overpaid for it at 5.99, damn they can't pay me to watch this movie over again."
1,DEFINATELY ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER MADE,"ANYONE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE WORK OF THE INFAMOUS GERMAN DIRECTOR UWE BOLL""REMEMBER THE NAME"" THIS GUY HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST DIRECTOR WHO HAS EVER LIVED, IF YOU SEE THE NAME , GIVE THE MOVIE A MISS.TO THINK ED WOOD WAS CONSIDERED THE WORST DIRECTOR IN HISTORY, THIS GUY MAKES ED WOOD LOOK LIKE COPPOLA, PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPAVE IS BETTER THAN ANY OF THIS CLOWNS FILMS.PLEASE MR BOLL DO THE WORLD A FAVOUR AND JUMP OFF A CLIFF."
1,"MST3K, Where are you When We Need You?","""Alone in the Dark"" has got to be the most ridiculous film made since the days of Ed Wood. I won't go into details, since the other reviewers have already given the gruesome details, except to say that everything you have heard is true about this turd.It is really,really, sad that Mike, Joel, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot are not around any longer because this film is tailor made for them.In fact anything by Uwe Boll would be a natural for MST3K"
1,Oh! This was a game first....Lions Gate = Baloney!,"Christian Slater, Stephen Dorff, and Tara Reid star in this mess of a film that starts off with an eye-chart explaining the parts of the movie that they did'nt have enough cash to film. I guess the young, male targets of this ""film"" were supposed to see Tara Reid in a skimpy outfit, go ""ooooh.."" and not laugh at her awful acting and the stupid script.Slater need a new agent, he is in yet another dog of a film - he is a fairly good actor who can do alot of the physical stuff required for this movie in a convincing manner.Halfway through all the explosions and carnage I started looking at my watch - ""GAME OVER""! The saddest thing about this debacle is that this movie had alot of potential to be good. Bottom Line: Lions Gate needs to stick to doing ""direct to video only"" films; they don't have the chops to make good major screen releases."
1,I thought Ed Wood had died.,"A long time ago, in a....This movie also starts out with some scrolling text, too bad it takes nearly five minutes. On the positive side, when the text finishes, you could save yourself about 90 minutes of anguish and walk out. This film definitely will challenge ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" as the worst horror movie ever made. The biggest difference between the movie and video game is the reset button. I kept looking for one in the theatre. You'd expect second rate acting from Tara Reid but not Christian Slater or Stephen Dorff. The love scene, if you could call it one (I don't remember any love scenes in the game)has successfully set lovemaking back 1000 years. Congratulations Uwe Boll with continuing the fine tradition of B-Movie making. Ed would have been proud."
1,uwe boll fails at life,"Have you ever been stabbed in the face? I haven't but while I was watching this movie, I had this almost overbearing curiosity to find out what its like. Seriously, this movie is so bad, suicide won't erase the haunting visions of sheer ineptetude from your mind. this movie is probably the worst movie ever made. well, there are worse movies out there, shatter dead and 13 seconds being two that i can name off the top of my head, but i mean come on both movies had a combined budget of a McChicken sandwhich with a small order of fries. whats this movies excuse?"
2,Letdown!!!!,"I was quite disappointed after renting this movie. It really seemed this would be a good horror movie. Not!!!!! I don't see why Christian Slater and Stephen Dorff ( good actor ) agreed to do this movie. In a nutshell, they investigate ancient creatures that become unleashed and now they must learn how to close the portal so the creatures can finally go away. Not scary, not thrilling and not suspenseful. I'm glad I did not buy this movie, even previously viewed and I'm glad I only spent $4 to rent it!!! Not worth it!!!"
1,Heed my warning: Avoid like the plague!!!!!!!!!,"For one, this movie came out in January and it's coming out on DVD in May? 4 months inbetween the theatrical release and the DVD release? Hello? This movie sucks. Trust me, I wasted 7 dollars and 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back. It shouldn't have even been relased to theaters in the first place. Actually, it never should have been made. Just don't watch this, I beg you. Don't make the same mistake I did."
1,rating = ZERO stars!,"from the beginning, to the very end of the movie, I couldn't BELIEVE the stupidity of it all. So yea, alien-like creatures attack earth and try to consume the planet. That's nothing new! This is not suspenseful at all! ZERO! I couldn't WAIT for the movie to be over with! The whole time, you are watching a bunch of stupid, pointless fighting. Usually in movies, you CARE if the main characters survive or not. In this one, you had absolutely NO feelings towards the main characters! You're sitting there, thinking ""ok, just die already! I DONT CARE!"" not even my mom or DAD liked this movie!WARNING: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. FILM CONTAINS EXTREME STUPIDITY."
1,Wow. Total Crap,"First lemme get this outta the way. I hate Uwe Boll. Bad things could happen to him and Id chuckle.That said, I wanted to be able to judge for myself how bad this man was, not just what Id heard. So I watched House of the Dead... You couldnt make me experience that ball of crud again if you threatened my family.BUT Alone in the Dark actually looked semi cool, disregarding how it abuses the game. So, like an alzheimers patient, I went to a free showing courtesty of my friend. I want my 2 hours back... and expenses for the nachoes! Horrible crap! Horrible! Someone stop this man from violating more games. Hell, Im at the point Im rooting for Paul Anderson (*shudder*) or whoever directed the old Mario Brothers movie..."
1,Should have went straight to video,"Seriously Stephen Dorf, it's time to fire your agent. This was seriously one of the worst movies to hit theaters in recent years. I seriously wonder how this movie actually made it onto the big screen. This movie is not even worth writing a longer review than this. Anybody who gives this movie more than 2 stars really must be retarded. Ugh."
2,So Bad It's Good,"This movie has everything-- predictable plot, wooden acting, monsters, bad guys, selfless heroes, villainous professors, pretty heroines, bombs, guns and explosions (although my husband noted that there wasn't much nudity or sex.) We had a great time making fun of it, guessing what was going to happen next (which wasn't hard; we were right every time) and laughing at the incredibly bad dialogue. This would be a good movie to watch on Halloween night with the kids who are too old for trick or treating. Turn off the lights, turn on the movie and let 'er rip."
1,Abysmal,"0 stars.Wretched acting;terrible editing;not even the music was any good.This is an all-around stinker and I advise anyone who is considering purchasing this bomb,please don't.This movie is sooooooooo bad,there isn't even a fun quotient like there is with an Ed Wood movie.What was Christian Slater thinking?????"
1,Don't EVEN rent it!,"I just rented this DVD and I must admit I made a HUGE mistake...The storyline(?) is stupid, the effects are medium quality, they sex scene is laughable, the score is annoying, the actors(?) are very bad (and move when there are supposed to be dead - see the end of the sandworm scene!)IN RESUME : totally bad, even for a fan of the video game"
1,Wow,"What can I say about this film. I am at a loss to find a single good thing to say about this film. I have to admit I rented this because the cover actually looks interesting, and the storyline described on the blurb seemed like my kind of thing. Some name actors in it....so how bad could it be. Well I have to tell you, this might have been the worst movie I ever saw. I can sit through any movie once, but halfway through this one I started reading the TV Guide. The story makes no sense, the acting is horrible, and the direction is the worst I have ever seen. It is almost as if he were just putting in random shots with no sense of flow or style. One minute it is like the Matrix, then it is Alien, then it is something else. Don't even give this a try, it is unwatchable."
1,"Boy, was this awful!",This is a bad movie. A very bad movie. There are no words in which I can express how horrible that movie is.
1,WOW,"I recently watched The Cave. That was by far one of the worst movies I had ever seen. Until tonight. Tonight, I watched, or rather, suffered through Alone in the Dark. Seriously, mistakes were made in this movie that I have never seen in any movie before. The fact that an actress was supposed to be dead & sat up before they cut to the next scene was just hilarious. I actually had to rewind it & watch it 3 or 4 times to make sure I wasn't seeing things. But despite my disbeleif, that's how hilariously cheap this movie is. I watch old, low budget horror movies for comedic value. But I mean REALLY low budget, like Ankle Biters.......or Black Roses, but considering this movie has 3 name actors, and a fair bit of decent CGI work in it, I though I would at least be able to take it seriously.........I laughed in disbelief through the entire second half of this pathetic movie."
1,"Not That Good, To Say The Least",I sat through the first 20 minutes of this movie and almost fell asleep. This movie is horrible. Every aspect of the film is badly done. Don't buy or even rent this movie. Take my word for it. I would rather watch paint dry than this garbage.
1,Fantastic,"Yup, the movie is awful. Yup, Tara Reid actually makes Denise Richard's turn as a physicist in ""The World Is Not Enough"" seem realistic. Yup, the story is filled with holes and is generally incomprehensible.Still, making fun of Tara Reid and co. for 90 minutes with your friends isn't the worst way you could spend a Saturday evening.But don't buy it. Unless your a masochist."
3,SIFI LOVER,I HAVE WATCHED 'ALONE IN THE DARK' TWICE AND HAVE NOW PURCHASED THE DVD. I ENJOY IT. I LIKE CHRISTIAN SLATERS STYLE. AND ALL OF THE PREVIOUS TRASHING COMMENTS ARE WAYYYYYYY OVER THE TOP.
1,Alone In The Dark Is Amazing?,"Ok I admit I actually paid 17.50 on this movie. I wasnt all that good. Ok let me say something in the directors defense. You all sould go out and buy up these movies. So that the guy will stop making movies.PROS & CONS:Pros:-Nothing was good about the movie.Cons:- The movie was random. First there was monsters then there was zombies. Then the end was terrible I had no Idea what monsters were at the end of alone in stupid land.- The over use of Slow motion in the first 25 min. of the movie.- Terrible acting.(P.s: Christian Slater is terrible, and Terra Reid bad too.)- Terrible Plot. It was so confusing the whole time.- Terrible over all movie. Its a so called a so Action flick. Man I tell you what. Its so bad that its funny.If you love crappy action/horror/videogame/ Movies the buy it just for the laugh.- The Movie Guy"
4,I don't get it...,"Okay, so I received this movie for free, and with little knowledge of its storyline or any other pre-existing hype. Perhaps had I paid to see it in a theater, with expectations that it be truly frightening, or something other than what it is, I may feel differently. Still, I really don't understand why it's received such low reviews from the majority. For its genre, I think its a decently entertaining production. Would I buy it? For $5.00 or less, yes. Will I watch it again, probably as I know others who will likely enjoy it. My advice? If you're a Sci-Fi/Horror fan, who counts the SyFy channel(formerly SciFi) among your favorites, then listen not to the reviews and try to watch it without expectations. You may be pleasantly surprised."
1,Worst film of the century,"Uwe Boll seems to be getting worse every year. This is by far the worst film of 2005. It's awful and boring from start to finish and like his previous disaster House of Dead makes a mockery of the source material. This is not a horror film, it's a boring, idiotic, and disgusting geek show from start to finish. Uwe ToiletBoll may very well be the worst director on record. I'm also very sad that he got the rights to Blood Rayne. The cast is good but I'm sure he'll find a way to butcher it still."
1,A sad sad video game...er...movie...,"I think I remember playing the game for like maybe a day, got pretty bored with it. But this movie. This movie. It should have not tainted a game like this one did. The acting wasn't bad. The special effects weren't that bad. But the story, the story tried so hard to be like Resident Evil meets H. P. Lovecraft. While that would be interesting, this movie, wasn't. It was just sad. Boring. Nothing new. No true experience. I've seen this type of movie a thousand times. The movie was too busy, the director and storyteller was trying to throw at the audiance too much stuff, too many ideas, it wasn't confusing, it was just so busy that it was not focused at one movie point that moves to the next movie point, like clear crisp chapters...In the end, the movie was too busy and in the end, boring. If you wish to see it, wait til the unrated (we all know its going to come out this way) version."
1,EDITING JOB,"You can tell the editors of this movie wanted out of this crap movie as fast as possible. There is a scene where the asian cop chick dies because of some monster thing bites her leg or her ass. One of the guys tells Stephan Dorff ""come on she's gone"" and you can actually see her get up, thinking the scene is over. HILARIOUS!!! They didn't even bother finishing the editing job. This movie will make Slater, Reid , and Dorff seriously consider sucking on the end of a gun barrel and pulling."
1,crap,"Things blew up, there was blood and aliens or something...fortunately, Tara Reid remained scantily clad for the majority of this film...other than that I have no idea what the point of this movie was. Plot hung on by a dangling thread, and was pretty much left unresolved, i guess. Please for the love of God, don't spend money on this, please. I'm telling you this for your own benefit. Do something more constructive with your money. Buy your girl something nice, take your mom out to lunch. Whatever you choose, i'm sure it will go towards something a little more worthwhile than this. 'Nuff said...Christ."
1,Worst movie ever,"I've bought this movie for mistake, on Italian edition there isn't Boll's name anywhere on the cover. if I remembered it was his I'd have left it on the shelf. Now I own it and so at least I watched it. I know wiser and funnier things to do to spend an evening, like play who's strongest between my head and a concrete wall, or bungieless jumping, or playing russain roulette with an automatic gun... Amazon should give also NEGATIVE numbers of stars for the rating just for things like this.Usually movies taken from comics or videogames are appreciated largely by fans of the original, here I fell Alone in the Dark fans are on the front line against this rape of a good franchise."
1,DO NOT LOOK UPON THE FACE OF CHAOS UNSPEAKABLE HORROR...,"I feel the darkness closing in upon me. I don't know what crossed the threshold, but I know one thing: Uwe Boll is a hack. I feel that my life essence, my IQ was sapped by this movie. Something was taken away from me which I shall never get back. How can the powers of Hollywood allow this blasphemy to continue? How can one man, the sub-mundane and putrid lack of talent named UWE relentlessly assault our senses? I implore you to not subject yourself and your loved ones to this unspeakable wretch of a movie. DO NOT LOOK INTO THIS DARKNESS AND HOPE TO FEEL WHOLE IN THE MORNING! YOG SOGGATH, WE PRAY TO THE END OF DAYS! CTHULU is a brighter spark upon humanity than this fowl tripe of a movie. I want my money back! Go buy some nice music. You have been warned!"
2,DISPOSABLE FLICK,"In viewing a film like ALONE IN THE DARK, you either have to expect a really classic type of film, or you have to just sigh and say, oh well, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. After the recent spate of bad horror films (Like WHITE NOISE, DARKNESS), I didn't have high hopes for this Uwe Boll mess, so I was mildly entertained by the movie's complex if indecipherable plot, the really bad acting from Christian Slater, Tara Reid and Stephen Dorff, and the typically adequate CGI effects. The movie doesn't really make a whole lot of sense and it's apocalyptic ending is a downer to say the least. But with my expectations low and my Frito Scoops in hand, I found myself remembering those mindless fifties horror movies and I wasn't too upset when it was over."
1,recycled B movies,Its unbelieable that scenes in this piece of trash is still being recycled. The plot as well as the film footage must have been swept up from the film editing floor by the janitor and spliced together.
1,The scariest part of the film was Christian Slater and Tara Ried's acting,I caught Alone in the Dark late last night and am still trying to figure out what kept me awake to watch it. It wasn't the story or the acting. I think it was my deep desire to see Christian Slater and/or Tara Ried get ripped apart by the creatures. In addition the a washed up slater and the always brilliant Tara Reid (joking) there was a special laughable appearence by Stephen Dorff. The overacting was abundant and everything else was severely lacking. The only positive about this film was the creatures themselves. They looked like and alien/scorpion mix and dwelled in the darkness. Very cool. Outside of that there really isn't much here folks.
5,Great Movie,including extended scenes. the directors cut of alone in the dark is even better than its original cut. based on the hit video game. the movie has a great story and even better creatures.
3,Not Great but Not Bad,"This movie was alright, it was definately better than house of the dead but just wasn't a movie that blows you away just o.k. I don't recommend wasting your money on going to see this film in theatres but it will be a pretty good rental flick."
1,This is from the guy who gave us.......,"HOUSE OF THE DEAD. Which was a freakin joke of a movie and even had the nerve to ridicule the Dawn of the dead remake. Only get the soundtrack for this movie. INFLAMES, SOILWORK , Mnemic, all Nuclear blast bands. Heavy metal baby. I like Christian slater and he hasnt done anythng good since TRUE ROMANCE, and I dont think this will change his losing streak. This director should be banned. NO I HAVENT SEEN THIS EITHER. Thats for all you"" Dont review it til you see it"" people. NOr should anyone."
1,Must stop uwe boll....,"ok this dude isnt to good at directing/casting. i didnt really finish this movie it was too confuseing lucky me i stole it from a nearby store but i honestly cant believe how bad of a director this dude is. house of the dead was horrible and this jackass doesnt learn from his mistakes. makeing a game to a movie is tough to do resident evil and tomb raider are good movies( i liek resident evil alot better) but i mean they were at least similar to the game. house of the dead their inside the house for liek 20 minutes and not only that but acting sucked, little clips of the game came up randomly out of nowhere, theres a box maybe 2 ft high and 2 feet long and they strt pulling out rocket launghers from a cop!? what the hell cops dont hAV ROCKET LAUNCHERS OR MACHINE GUNS lol this dudes pathetic at movie makeing even ed wood would say hes a disgrace."
2,its bad...but I have seen worse,"Poor acting by all the actors and actresses. Probably Slaters worst movieA very rushed horror movie (in terms of production). You will leave with an empty feeling, or you will say ""did I miss something?"""
1,"So bad, it may be destined for cult classic status","This movie is total garbage. I got it as a free bonus, but still feel ripped off! The acting and plot are atrocious. It's like a bad cable movie. Unfortunately, you can't change the channel on this! Seriously, it is so bad from start to finish, that it could reach cult classic status."
1,What a waste of money,I actually bought this DVD. I didn't read any reviews on it prior to buying it. The cover and story looked good on the box. I got home and watched it and fell asleep. Tried to watch it again and couldn't believe how incredibly awful this movie is. I hate wasting my money on stuff like this. The only saving grace is that I can take it and trade it at the game store. Even though they will prolly not even give me a dollar trade in value for it.
1,Complete waste of time,"Two words.... Ewe Boll. This movie was just plain horrible. I can't think of a single saving grace. The direction was bad. The special effects were bad. The acting was bad. The script was horrible. I think this movie killed Christian Slater's career! Over all, it's almost 2 hours of my live I wish I could get back."
3,Its not that bad,"Guys, I don't understand why the venom on this movie. Yes, it wasn't that great, but it did follow the game pretty good, I have the game. I thought Slater and Reid did fine and also Dorff, although a little underused. I was going to skip the movie altogether,due to the reviews here, but my husband was adamant about seeing it, and it truly was not that bad."
4,People are too picky...,"Don't expect a big Blockbuster movie and then you won't be let down. If you don't nitpick about tiny little things that you normally wouldn't notice in a movie (like the FBI's timely arrivals) then it's a good movie. It's a little more action than it is horror, and worth a watch."
4,good movie,i saw this movie twice in the united artist movie theaters before near my block. i have too say that christian slater and tera reid did a fantastic job on this movie. since they both made good chemistry and the action is fun too watch.
4,Alone in the Dark,I heard alot of bad things about this movie from the critics. But I watched this movie anyway because all the critics in my opinion is just trippin and stopping people for missing a nice movie. So when I saw the whole movie I was amazed since this movie has alot of action and decent special effects. And avoid listening to the critics because they will deter you from missing a superb action movie that has a well known cast.
1,Very Disappointing,I was very disappointed with this film. The movie had no definite direction. The music and the sound effects overrode the actors speaking most of the time. There was so much background music playing that there was not enough silence to even have a remotely scary scene. I expected much more from this movie. I would ignore the 5 star comments on this page. I based my interest off those comments to go see the movie. They had to of been made up comments or people with bad taste in movies. I feel like I wasted my money seeing this film. I think that the rest of the audience felt the same way. There was no response to the film from the audience the entire time. I'm just very disappointed.
1,more boll movement ?,"I hate this train wreck of a movie done by that @$$ no talent monkey's...dung UWE BOLL. i have seen made for tv movies look better couldn't understand it's charters are so poorly written the story was a piece of ....garbage, and what was the deal with the proffesor (or what ever the hell he is) letting these dull looking creatures into this dimension. maybe i wasn't paying attention but i couldn't understand what his problem was. didn't make any sense. and not to mention the really stupid ending(the city taken over by those monsters according to MR. BOLL) but the worst part about this movie is that it shares the same name as a jack palance movie that's a real horror movie, so everytime i go to bestbuy walmart etc. they think i am looking for this PIECE OF MONKEY...DUNG."
1,Just like Pitch Black...only it sucked.,"Wow, this was a bad movie. I will enumerate the best parts for you:1. The gun fight in total darkness, so that the only light was from the muzzle flashes and tracers. Awesome2. Christian Slater doesn't open the door which might hold ""all the answers I've been looking for."" Very original3. The ending music by Nightwish, ""I Wish I Had An Angel."" Fun over-the-top Goth musicNow for the bad. The creatures looked like they came out of the Giger Design School, particularly from the Alien movies. The plot was uninteresting. (Lots of creatures attack and we have to beat them.) The female characters, while attractive, must have studied at the Ed Wood School of Acting."
1,Don't Even Think About it. 6 out of 100.,"Absolutely horrendous acting. Watching this movie was like setting your hair on fire. Think of about 30 other things to do tonight before even considering Alone in the Dark. Hokey, over-dramatic, poor story telling, un-inspired, dull and tedious. Christian Slater may well be working as a people greeter for Wal-Mart by next year unless they see his role in this movie.Total Score (out of 100) = 63 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.2 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?1 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?0 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?0 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?0 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?"
2,FAKES,"Ok, to be honest, i have not seen the movie. I did. But then there was just so many negative reviews for it so that i think i'll save my money for a rental. Well anyway, the point of this review is to tell everyone not to judge the movie based on many of the 5 star reviews on this site. If you check the background to many, this is the only review on their record. Meaning, they were probably invented just to give this movie a ratings boost because the studio or someone probably realized that EVERYONE gave this film an average of about 1 1/2. So yeah, if you look at the reviews, look at the ones with at least a paragraph of review, not just a sentence b/c those are probably the ones that have been made up. Thank you."
5,What a wonderful voice!,"I never, I repeat never tire of James Taylor's voice. There's nothing that soothes the nerves like the mellifluous tones from this master. As you can tell, I really love James Taylor's music and have been a fan for years. I recently attended a concert of his and it was great.Concerning this disc, the songs are performed to perfection with super audio and video quality. You really get the sense you're there in the audience. His backup singers are superb. There's even one number where one backup singer steals the show!Lyric captioning is provided so you can sing along to his songs. I wish all music DVDs had on-screen lyrics. My wife and I love to sing along with our favorite performances. Surprisingly, this feature is missing from many music DVD titles.If you are a James Taylor fan in the slightest, you'll want this disc in your collection."
3,"Lots Of Great Songs Presented Well, But.....","James Taylor performs almost two hours worth of songs at a semi-famous theater in New York City in the late '90s.These are mostly great songs, about every hit song he ever had and more, and his voice is in fine form. The only problem I found was that it got monotonous after awhile. Although likable, Taylor is not exactly an animated performer, nor are his shows. After a half dozen or so tunes they all start sounding similar. Lately, though, I've seen him on other venues like Eric Clapton''s Crossroads Guitar Festival, and Taylor is very animated! Guess he's getting spry in his old age!Here, though, he isn't. He just stands there and sings. This is better just played as background music while you are doing something else. In other words, it's better served as a CD rather than a DVD.But it's an excellent concert as Taylor and his band perform beautifully."
3,"Good video, Poor 5.1 sound","The color and camera shots are great, but again Sony has messed up a good concert with HT capabilities.The audio on this concert would match pro-logic (VHS)It's too bad Sony has to have their way on things they don't have full rights to.You want to hear 5.1 that rocks, rent John Fogerty on Netflix, you'll understand what dolby digital is all about....."
3,let down,I was a little dissappointed in this DVD. I didn't enjoy the playlist of this show as much as others and the quality left a little to be desired
5,Fantastick!,"I think James Taylor is a classic folk singer. It was wonderful concert, I've never had the opportunity to see him in concert."
3,"I was hoping for so much more, pain.","The content of this DVD is entertaining in parts , but i think that a die hard fan (not the Bruce willis movie..HA.HA, Oh! forget it) will apprieciate it much more. Especially Emma PRATT, yes her real name. She smells. But the DVD is quiet good but not my cup of tea."
1,i got bored...,"Man, is this guy boring!I bought this dvd for all the great reviews, but was very disappointed. My mind dwelled off after two songs, and at number four I was doing something else. Sorry folks!"
5,JT stands for Just Terrific,"Simply put, this DVD is one of the top 5 concert DVD's released to date. Sound quality can't be beat. Voices and high notes are crystal clear, the bass rocks. Likewise, the image quality and saturation is excellent.Some of the songs, ""Steam Roller"" for instance, is done in a new and refresing style. This disc has all his major hits along with some of some of his more obsquere songs mixed with some of the songs off ""Hourglass.""If you are anything from a casual fan upward, this DVD is a must buy.If I had to voice one complaint, it would be the audiance. What a group of reserved stuff shirts. Some of the songs he performed, I could hardly sit still and I am 54. Very few stood and grooved with JT. I have had two groups of people in my home theater to watch this concert and we were all up dancing, claping and singing along. I have been to see James Taylor in concert and he got almost everyone up at it to."
5,Excellent to the max,"As a Taylorphile I have to say that this DVD is absolutely beautiful, no wonderful, no it's beyond wonderful. The delivery was quicker than was stated. Best money I have spent in years. If it was just a CD it would be worth it. With the video it's fantastic. And no I am not James's mother."
3,"Turn off the video, listen to the music...","Indeed a musical gem. However the video is horrible. Whoever directed this must have thought they were at a football match or a speed-metal concert - not a single shot lasts more than 10 seconds...I ended up turning the projector off, reveling inthe music. Somewhat expensive for a 'cd' though..."
2,wake me up when it is over...,"If someone had put this together as a mixed tape, it would have got one listen and then wound up on the floor of my car. What separates a great compilation from a snooze-fest is song placement. A great compilation takes you on a ride - it builds and blends and makes you want to hear more. This does none of that - the songs jerk back and forth with no continuity or vision and it is annoying. I sold this after trying to listen to both disks a few times with no luck. I know there were individual gems, but the CDs overall were too much dreck to wade through."
2,4 should be more,"There are only four actual songs on this release. Unless you must have all of the out-takes (why?), skip it--because that's what you'll be doing every time you play it."
5,Nine Days to Christmas unlocks the Magic of Christmas in Mex,"As a child, this book open the world to me. Nine Days to Christmas lets children learn about and explore the traditions of Christmas in Mexico while capturing the thrill and confusion of early childhood. Thirty years after reading this book, I look forward to sharing the magic of Nine Days to Christmas with my own children."
5,A wonderful story,"I first read this a child..... I was delighted by the both the writing and beautiful pictures; even as a an adult,I am still enchanted with this jewel of a book! Truly timeless,and a gentle reminder of the meaning of The Nine Days of Christmas.Also,a window into Mexican culture which could be shared by all.Ceci sees and feels so many things,excitement,anticipation,and loss.As I've said,a wonderful story to be shared."
3,Sweet Christmas Story,"This book is rich with fascinating traditions from the Latino culture. First published in 1959, this Caldecott Medal picture book tells the story of a young girl in Mexico who is hosting her first Christmas party. The girl hopes to have a pinata at her party. When the day of the party finally arrives and she does in fact have a beautiful pinata which she was able to choose herself, she is devastated when she realizes it will be crushed. In the end, the pinata, which is shaped like a star, disappears into the night sky where she knows it will live forever.This book is a bit slow at the beginning. However, it really comes together at the end with a sweet finish.~DeeDee Fox, Author and Illustrator, The Ruby Red Slippers"
3,Almost every band has a stinker!,"This is V.P.'s worst. Thankfully it only has seven true album tracks. This is, in my opinion, a poorly realized experimental noise album and a bit too self-indulgent for other listeners to enjoy. The rest of their material is top-notch but this poor example of V.P. is a sad waste of $20. The album sucks but the live tracks are decent. Get ""If I Die"" instead. DO NOT start with this album if you are unfamiliar with V.P.."
3,Mellow,"This is a very mellow and relaxing album. You'd think that they were trying to milk some kinda indie market for what it was worth, but they do have a sincerity to the sound that is hard to find. If you've ever seen or heard at least one of these songs, then this would be a good buy. If not, or if you have to have everything mainstream, don't even bother."
5,Boots,Have been looking for harness boots to wear while riding bike. These were the cheapest I found' seems to a little big but they are great.
1,Poor support,Very disappointed in this purchase. The bra has no spport base at all. It is Longlined so helps bring in the waist.
4,"Brings in the waist, but that's about all.","This bra is fantastic for wearing under vintage clothing, when you're going for that bullet bra look. It brings in the waist and provides that lovely rib-cage shaping so vital for 50s ""new look"" dresses. However, it offers very little in the way of cup support and nothing in the way of the kind of cup molding that is common with modern brassieres. This means that the wear one can get from this undergarment is very limited, particularly for small-busted ladies."
3,Good information,"This book gives some excellent information on how children's bodies work, how to fix some problems, it gives recipes on some medicines, and tells you what herbs are used for certain sickness, but it does not give you dosage; how much of each herb needs to be used for certain age, how it needs to be prepared, it has great information about aroma oils, and how they can be used, but as far as herbs go, it just tells how many parts of each kind of plant you need to have, no necessary specifics given."
2,Not bad but not great either,"This is a good beginner book but the problem I have is the lack of specifics. He provides plenty of Herbal combinations for some general recipes, but do not expect ratios. I'd have given a higher rating if he at least explained how to make a TincTrac, instead of just dangling it out there as a ""better way"" for Children. I would not go so far to call this a bait and switch, but at the end of the book he provides a URL to an equally vague web site that drives the customer to some pricey classes.It may be my loss, but based on the book, I would be sceptical about the classes."
5,"Great Music, great price!","I was a bit skeptical when I placed the order for cafe tacuba's un viaje. I had read previous reviews that mentioned the quality being a big let down and the sound as well. I listened to the cd before watching the DVD, and did not find a reason for the sound complaints. I actually found it to be pretty clear to the point of feeling part of the concerts in which the recordings took place.I sat to watch the DVD and realized that the critics of the image quality must have only seen the beginning of the concert which was done in black and white with a grain effect to accent the songs that were being performed. I thought this was pretty unique, as well as other methods of filming that were employed for the concert.The band gives a great performance as always and is translated into the 3 CD's and DVD that complies un viaje. I think this is a great buy for the price is being sold for."
3,It's sing LIVE,"The song selection is great. I couldn't believe that they had compiled all those cool songs in this pack. But I guess I failed to read that it was from a concert they gave in Mexico, so of course his voice shifts quite a bit and gets tired. Anyway, not what I expected."
3,"CD's Ok, DVD not so much","After first listening to it, I tought ""maybe if I saw them live"" I wouldn't discriminate the singer Pinche Juan letting the audience sing most of the songs throughout the 3 cd's, wich again and again fall into a ""What now? Let me guess, the people are gonna do the singing again"" routine during the several days of recording the concerts. So you know what the trend is, Pinche Juan is a good entertainer and a great singer, when he does it. The one sided conversation in between songs are lacking articulation and sense for the most part. The DVD is a cut and paste that had me thinking it was shot by a few amateurs with a low budget, too bad they packed the Palacio De Los Deportes and theirs pockets as well to come out with a regular-to-ok package."
2,Poorly made.........in China,"I purchased this for my neice about a year ago but little did i know it was made in China so my sister (her mom) nixed it immediately for use as a lunch box. So then neice used it to keep her crayons and magic markers, etc together...and then the latch that keeps it closed broke! Obviously this was terrible quality, certainly not worth buying."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!,This lunch box is VERY small and poorly made. It fell apart as soon as I tried to open it (the lid came right off). What a complete waste of money.
4,A good introductin to ASM and Implicit style Verilog,"ASM and Verilog are cool stuff for digital designers, however implicit style Verilog is unlikely to be widely adopted. Sythesis tools do not support this style."
2,ASM and Verilog is a bad mix.,"The author obviously is trying to force Verilog and ASM notation into the same book. The result is the implicit use of Verilog states which in effect results in unmanagable Verilog spaghetti code. Having a background in both hardware design and software consulting the Verilog code in the book is terrible. It can be compared to a jumble of assembly language without any comments of structure - sure, if you know the background of the design (i.e. the ASM charts) you might see why the code might work but the Verilog code by itself is not readable!If you do some research you'll quickly see that ASM charts are not widely used these days. Most engineers in the industry are using well defined moore state machines because they are easy to understand and maps very well to case statements in Verilog.I will now skim through the rest of the book to see if there might be some content NOT related to ASM charts that might be worth picking up..."
1,It is the wrong book.,"The author forgot to update this book for solaris 8. If you compare this book to the solaris 7 book written by the same author, you will find out that the two books are largely the same.I took the solaris 8 exam part 1 after reading this book and I failed it miserably. I have 3 years of hands-on experience with solaris.Darrell, please update your book or change the title back to solaris 7."
2,"Maybe, it is useful as an introductory book.","I study the book thoroughly, but I failed.I don't even know what to say about the book. It is simply NOT for solaris 8 part 1 exam. That is it."
1,I want to give the book ZERO star.,"I gave it 1 star, simply because I could not give it a ZERO or MINUS star.I bought this book in early September. I have over six years of work experience with Unix (4 years of Solaris). I carefully studied everything from Chapter 1 to Chapter 12. Unfortunately, I failed the Part One Exam badly. So, I know it from the first hand experience that Chapters 1 to 12 are useless for Part One Exam.Maybe, just maybe, the rest of the chapters are useful for Part Two Exam. However I myself have no desire to try it out."
5,"Congratulations, John!","""Freedom"" is simply wonderful! As you go from one song to another, your mood might change slightly, but the main feeling - of joy and happiness - will remain in the background. Let's hope we hear some more from this talented guy..."
4,An amazing story about an amazing man,"My Boy is the story of Philip Lynott as told by the mother who brought him into the world and who was at his side during the final days of his life.But it is also Philomena Lynott's own story, from the difficult days as a single mother struggling to bring up a young black child in Manchester and Dublin, through the heady success of Thin Lizzy, to the tragic chain of events which ended her son's life and plunged her into a fierce depression from which she only slowly recovered.Illustrated with many previously unpublished photographs from the Lynott family albums, My Boy is an intimate portrait of one of Ireland's greatest rock stars. It is, by turns, moving, celebratory and painful - but always fiercely honest.Bravely, My Boy goes beyond any clichéd tale of sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll. The story of Philip and Philomena Lynott was much more than that. Because, in the end, My Boy is a love story like no other."
5,A Mother's Story,"My Boy is Philomena Lynott's personal account of the life and death of her only child- legendary rocker Phil Lynott.Aside from being a story about triumph, Phil's rise from being an illigitimate black boy in catholic Dublin during the 1950's to being leader of the world renowned rock band Thin Lizzy, it is also an account of a mother's love for, and tragic loss of, her only child.Philomena Lynott wrote this book as if she were speaking to you personally, giving an honest, bones and all, account of her son's life.Her account of his death through heroine addiction is one of the most poignant and heart wrenching stories I have ever read.The book leaves one with the mixed emotions of joy and sadness but I would thoroughly recommend this book to any music fan."
3,Philip Lynott,"While the book was quite interesting, especially as I remember Phil Lynott when he was starting out. My friend and I used to go into the Peacock Theatre on our school lunch break to hear them practise, and later to their gigs at St Paul's, Sybill Hill. But, I found the story rather self-serving and egocentric. ""Methinks she doth protest too much"". Was the book about the mother or the son?"
5,Very practical...,"This is a very useful and practical resource for designing interventions for reading problems in the schools. The book takes a very hands-on approach to designing these interventions, and takes you step-by-step through the process. Overall, it's a great book for school professionals."
1,Don't use with Toro 1800 (38381) Power Curve Snow Thrower,"Check before you buy the Coleman Cable 02469 14/3 SJTW Low-Temp Outdoor Extension Cord with Lighted End, 100-Foot for uses with the Toro 1800 (38381) Power Curve Snow Thrower as recommended by Amazon. The 100' Extension Cord is rated at 13amps and the blower is rated at 15amps, so the cord may or may not handle the load of this blower. That maybe the reason for some of the fires that have been reported with this cable. The 50' Coleman Cable is rated at 15amps so it seems to be the right one for this blower."
1,Plug smoked and burned while using with snowblower,"I ordered this cord with a Toro 1800 Electric Curve Snow Thrower. The second time that I cleared my driveway, I smelled smoke. The plastic plug from this extension cord that was plugged into my snowblower was melting and burning! The snow on the driveway was about 3"" of light powder, not heavy wet snow. The snowblower was handling it well. The plastic used for this plug is unsafe for use with outdoor equipment."
5,SWITCH ON,"MY ITEM ARRIVED ON TIME & IN GOOD CONDITION.I ALSO PURCHASED A TORO SNOW BLOWER WITH THIS POWER CORD.THETEMPRATURE HERE WAS -5deg. & THE CORD REMAINED FLEXABLETHE ENTIRE TIME OF CLEARING THE DECK & DRIVEWAY OF 10""OF SNOW.I WAS PLEASED ENOUGH WITH THIS ITEM, THAT IPURCHASED ANOTHER THE FOLLOWING WEEK.GOOD PRODUCT!J.J."
4,Solid product,Works well in cold weather. Power light is a unexpectedly useful feature for outdoor use.
1,Do Not buy for use with Toro Curve 1800 Snow Blower!,"Do not buy this cord for use with the Toro Curve 1800 Snow Blower. It is not rated at 15 Amps load and will eventually cause a fire and damage to your snow blower. Buy a cord rated at 15 amps, like the 12/3 outdoor flexible cords."
3,average; but short changed on length,"seems good enough quality, but what i got was short by two feet! i like to get what i paid for and that ticks me off. good for them shorting the customer by 2 feet, which then for every 25 cords they sell the next is pure profit. just a penny here, and one there...who will miss the consumer getting cheated."
5,Coleman Cable 14/3 50-Foot Hi-Visibility/Low-Temperature Outdoor Extension Cord,"Very good. Though I should have gotten a longer cord, 100 ft for my snow thrower."
2,Fire hazard,"I bought this cord in February 2008 and used it mostly with my Toro 1800 Electric Curve Snow Thrower. Today, while I was removing snow from my driveway, it caught fire. I did contact Coleman Cable and they honored the lifetime warranty; I shipped them the defective power cord (free shipping) and they sent me a new one. I will not use it with my snowblower though."
2,Becareful!! International ed,"Okay, I always bought international editions when I can get it cheaper, but!! BE CAREFUL this international edition the content is same but home work problems and solutions are mixed SO ARE NOT IDENTICAL TO THE US EDITION.When I turn in my first homework assignment, everything was wrong because this book have problems that are different than the US edition."
5,"Good Fundamentals, comprehensive",The book is great at covering the fundamentals. There are plenty of examples and the material is well explained. The CD that comes with the book was also a GREAT supplement. The CD has concise explanations that are simpler and quicker to understand.
3,so far,"So far this book is pretty good, but it needs more examples and a short study guide with conversion problems would be helpful. Some of the homework problems really take some time and creative unit changes."
1,"This is not the one and orginal ""STEVE PERRY'","I am a HUGE Journey and Steve Perry fan. I don't know who had the info on this dude but someone messed up. THIS is not ""STEVE PERRY' from JOURNEY or MR. PERRY'S SOLO career.. Now I am stuck with a cd that I don't want charged money that I can not get back. and the kids will not even listen to this artist. In the future maybe someone needs to ask for a pic or a cd pic to stop this confusion.I think that maybe a disclaimer should be put on this cd stating that you are NOT buying The ""Voice"" that wonderful rich sounding STEVE PERRY that we fans love and look for more music from."
1,I can't believe you'd (Amazon) do that!,"I have been a Steve Perry fan for years with Journey or without. I am constantly on the look out for new or old CD's by him. When I first saw ""I need U"" by ""Steve Perry"" I was blown away because I had not heard nor seen it before this. Well, Amazon, you are pretty sneeky I'd say. For shame. I use this site all the time and I will now have to be far more careful. The rating is for Amazon."
2,Cute but broken,"The second I opened the box (from amazon) two of the glasses were broken! Immediately returning this set. They look lovely, but apparently can't even handle shipping. Besides, I saw the same set @ Ross for 12.99..."
2,Pretty,"This item is pretty and functional but the rims are not thick enough for me. I have cut my finger washing glasses that are to thin, and I always try to get one I can stick my complete hand in or almost. I gave these to my daughter in law."
4,Nice design,I love the heavy base and the slight taper at the top. They are very easy to hold even when wet.
2,"Nice, but fragile","I bought these because I loved the way they looked. It's a nice, simple design, but it breaks so easily. My husband broke 3 the first week we had them just by washing them. And they chipped very easily too. I was sad to replace them."
4,Pretty but delicate,"All glasses arrived perfectly without a single chip or crack! I also really like the look of the curved sides and way it feels in my hand. Then I tested washing a few glasses in my dishwasher, and one of them cracked. I'm washing mine by hand now, which is not a big deal since the curved sides make it easy to reach in and clean."
3,Pretty however break easily,"They are a lovely set, however, the smaller ones are especially fragile and all of them were broken in the dishwasher within a year of purchase. The larger ones held up much better."
1,Fragile: Handle with Care (or just skip and buy something better),"Received these as a gift for our wedding - they look nice and have a good feel to them. Unfortunately, after only 7 months, all but three of these glasses have broken! Okay, so two of them dropped off the counter and any other glass would have broken in the same way...but the others... If the glass falls over on the table, not only do you deal with the spilled liquid, but with the glass shards. Poor, poor quality. Do not buy!"
3,"Nice, but thin","These glasses are very pretty and are a nice fit in the hand; however, I cannot place them in the dishwasher. They are too thin at the lip and too heavy at the bottom. I had one break in the dishwasher the first time it was put in. It does not matter how they are put in as I tried several times to no avail. I now have to hand wash them."
5,Great price,"This review is only based on price, as I purchased them as a gift and cannot do a review on using them. Shipping was fast, the glasses were intact and this is the best price around including Target, Homegoods, Macys, etc. Nice looking glasses."
1,most of these glasses are already chipped and had to be thrown away - what a waste of money. I am totally dissatisfied.,Most of these glasses have already chipped and had to be thrown away. What a waste of money. I am totally dissatisfied with this product.
2,Break too easily :(,"Our dishwasher might be a little rough, but most of our glasses broke within a year. They were broken in the dishwasher or sink or from stacking. None were dropped. I love the way they looked in the picture. They aren't as nice in real life, but if they didn't break, they would be fun for every day glasses. I usually like Libbey glasses. These break way too easily."
1,Waste of Money,"Out of 16 glasses, all but 2 have broken in the dishwasher in the first month! Our other glasses are still just fine.These glasses look and feel great but will not last unless maybe you wash them by hand."
2,Poor quality,"I purchased this set a year ago, and all of the smaller tumblers developed cracks in them and had to be discarded. The workmanship on these glasses is very poor."
4,Extremely easy to esemble!,"This bike was so easy to put together. It took me less than 10 minutes. Great design, too. It's like two bikes in one. You could ride it like a tricycle or like a big wheel when you flip it over. Easy to flip over, too. We paid $49.99 for the red one."
3,I've had better,I am really not a fan of the bike. My daughter has a difficult time with this bike. The steering is hard and your child must have strong legs to get the bike going. At its current price point I don't see it being worth your money. This is not a bike I would take for a nice walk at the beach. Once your child gets tired (which a two or three year old will) you're stuck lugging this heavy piece of plastic. The plastic seems durable yet this bike in not what I expected.
1,Not a good purchase.,"I made the mistake of not researching this item well enough. It was on sale for $11.00. Arrived with a suggested retail price sticker on the bottom for $10.00. Oh well, did get free shipping."
3,INTERESTING SUMMARY OF A FASHION GENIUS,"For those who are fashion addict, but not only for the trends, this book is a ""must have"". In a group of very representative photos you will find a good summary of his work. One jewel, Mister Bergé, former Yves Saint Laurent Couture President and close friend of him introduce the book with the conviction of somebody who was with him since the begining. I love it."
4,The artists' paradise,"Carl Little, a poet, essayist, art critic and (to make ends meet) Director of Public Relations for College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine, has made it his life's work to glorify his great loves: language, painting, and Maine. In Art of the Maine Islands he collaborates once again with his `Comrade in Art,' designer Arnold Sklonick--this time to offer an assortment of artists all in one way or another captivated by the charm of Maine's chilly dark air, red rocks and frothing waters. Little and Skolnick have the breadth of appreciation to have included contemporary art along with the more staid efforts of the 19th and early 20th Centuries. The book's lively and diverse ninety-six pages probably are more designed to invite leafing through on a coffee table, than to increase the dry and dusty clutter on the scholar's bookshelf. It is homage to a place artists have always loved--and in its colorful pages you can see why."
4,find a PLACE to have your event,"This was a great book but it needs to be updated. This book is all about PLACE. Where you are going to hold your event. In my case I was planning a wedding. It was really good for finding interesting locations. (I had my wedding at the Brookfield Zoo.) We did not want a generic hotel. If you are trying to find a cool place to have an event this book is good. Don't buy it, check it out from the library. I hope they update it."
3,the basic kit is not enough,"- first of all, I just brought the kit from Michael's in CA yesterday, it's $19.99, but you can use the 40% off coupon on it, so don't pay the high Amazon price.- secondly, prepare to shell out anywhere from $20 - $40 for more supplies you will need in addition to the contents of this basic box. You will not be able to make your class project if you don't have the Meringue Powder, materials for the cake, and also material for the icing.- some things you will need in addition (and not included in Kit #2 either), turn table for the cake to sit on, icing color, piping gel, more bags + coupler + tips if you want to play more.- you will also need the cardboard for the cake to sit on, and maybe a box to carry the cake around? ( I'd say use the turn table and reuse a cake box from your past purchases of birthday cakes"
2,Wilton Course 1 Student Kit,Save your money and buy one of the wilton kits that come with the caddy. This kit is not a good value. It doesn't come with the practice sheets. You have to buy the book too. If you can get a coupon at Michael's or Jo-Anns you can buy a kit at 50% or 40% off.
3,Okay product,"When I got the set it was three plus weeks after I had ordered it and the package was smushed and the box was broken. I would buy the set from Wilson, it is cheaper and gets there in perfect condition."
1,"Walker mufflers, very poor workmanship.","Walker mufflers distinguish themselves by absolutely horrendous workmanship. The first muffler purchased through Auto Zone store had unbelievable inferior and incomplete welding between the exhaust pipes and the muffler body and therefore had to be returned. The second Walker muffler purchased through Amazon.com had a good welding job, but disgustingly did not fit at all and had to be substantially modified before it could be installed into the vehicle. The quality control at Walker leaves a lot to be desired ."
3,No protection!!!,"so I love amazon, and been happy with them overall...we order so much stuff from them, but this one was a bit of a disappointment. for some silly reason, their idea of packaging was basically to cover the ends of the pipes with plastic, and that was it. the rest was left to the whim of UPS, or of course did their usual number on it. it arrived with some scratches and a nice dent on the bottom. would've sent it back, but damage wasn't terrible, and I already had an appt the next day to get it installed, so really didn't have much choice.it otherwise seemed to install and fit fine...least according to the shop that installed it.but I'm knocking them two stars for the shipping...as you basically are playing Russian roulette with the muffler and the condition you're gonna get it in."
5,Life Saver,"Due to failing health, my eighty-eight year old mother is homebound 24/7 and two of her great joys are eating and watching television. One of her favorite shows is the Andy Griffith Show--he's an ""innocent"" just like my mother--and since Comcast dropped him from my mother's viewing schedule, we turned to VHS videos. Saying they are a life saver is a stretch, I admit; she wouldn't die if she couldn't watch Andy six hours a day...at least I don't think so. I could be wrong and I don't want to chance it, so let's just stick with the life saver story. The transaction with the seller was excellent and the tapes came in days rather than days."
5,It is important to know what they were thinking back then,"I very much like this book and highly recommend it because the author talks about what our Founders were thinking of back then.If you want to know what the Founders thought about separation of church and state, this book will tell you. Most of these men were religious in some way, and they put the idea of separation of church and state right into the Constitution. That phrase is used today to actually suppress the practice of religion, and to substitute the new State Religion of psychology, psychiatry, etc.If you want to know what they meant by the Second Amendment, this book will tell you."
5,Mandatory Reading,This book should be the required text for all high school and college government classes. It is easy to read and contains information not readily available in most text books on the Constitution.
5,A Book that needs to read by every 13 year old in America,"I read this book about a year ago, the way it broken down each section of the Constitution in easy to understand language, using alot of first person quotes and text direct from the writings of the Founding Fathers. If you want to learn about the intent of the Constitution this is a great place to start. It would also be a great text book for home schoolers and just plain schools."
5,constitution very well approached and defined,"This book is extremely interesting because it commenced with the development of the constitution, the inspiration of the founder's. Their total alligence and dedication to a document so vitally important to the building of a nation deemed for the freedom of all. Totally interesting and informative to scholars and lay people alike. I found it to be in easy to understand language. Tremendously interesting."
5,Best American Government Textbook,"This book is kinda long winded, but only in so-far as it has complete explanations for the reasoning behind the writing of the constitution. Goes well with the instructional DVD from the National Center for Constitutional Studies."
5,A compendium of reflections on the nature of reality,"I found this book truly magnificent in it's depth of understanding and it's ability to convey that to the reader. In my opinion, this is a work of genius not always apparent upon the first casual flick through it's pages.It's all in the reading really...you don't just read this book as you would a normal book. It's written in the third person, as a series of reflections on God, by God. That may sound strange but that's exactly what it is - God contemplating his own nature and the universe that he has created. And if you read each chapter AS a meditation and take in every word - THINK about every word you read as you read it - it will plant amazing seeds in your mind that will provide food for thought for many years to come.A masterpiece of metaphysical philosophy."
5,"Bad title, good book","This is another example of a good book that might be missing out on some readers because of an unfortunate title. It's not the cat sitter who dies, but it is Dixie (a former deputy not yet recovered fron an intense personal loss looking for a way to nuture without loving too much)who discovers the body as she checks in on one of her charges. And it's not cutesy cozy either as the title might imply. It touches on some hard issues of prejudice, greed, and family dysfunction. Dixie is an attractive protagonist, and her relationship with her brother and his partner is appealing. (Brother-sister acts are showing up these days aren't they?) The mystery has some surprising twists and turns, and a satisfying resolution."
2,disappointed,"I was looking forward to starting a new mystery series with a new (to me) author, but was I disappointed. The mystery was probably good,BUT, I am very tired of having the gay community shoved down my throat. I do not approve of this lifestyle and am tired of it being the ""in"" thing and people pushing it and trying to make it acceptable and normal - it is not! If the author had not written the whole book and plot based on the gay lifestyle I would have enjoyed it a lot. Unfortunately, I will not be buying another of this author's books since two of the main characters in the plot (the brother and his partner) are gay and since the activities of the whole cast of characters seemed to revolve around a gay club, gay bashing, and gay relationships. Unfortunate because this could have been a good read and I would have enjoyed a new author."
1,Pretty darn boring,"I gave this book a few really good shots to get interesting and finally gave up halfway through. The author used the main character to lecture her audience about cat care, the other characters were boring or just plain nasty, and I never did find myself caring whatsoever about who committed the murder and why. I have read all of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum books and this author needs to take some hints as to how to write an engaging plot. I don't need to read about the detailed records kept on all the pets, how exactly to groom a cat, how she keeps an extra packet of cat food on her, that her day starts unrealistically early and so forth. Don't waste your time on this less-than-fluff novel that needed at least another revision before publication."
2,Just So So,"This was not what I expected. I enjoy the petsitting part. Her past ~~ ex cop, widow, deceased child age 3, abandond by her mom, etc.... way too much. Did not enjoy the crude and foul language. Not sold on this author yet...."
2,book,"Sorry, but I found this book to be a little too silly and unbelievable. I live in Florida so I wanted to read this author who writes about a pet sitter on Siesta Key. I read two of her books and found them both the same; a pet sitter who somehow finds dead people at the homes she visits. And to make it worse, the pet sitter ends up in the center of the investigation. She does too many things that -- to me -- a person would not do."
4,A Surprise in Disguise....,"This is my first book by this author and although a fast read, with a bit of the negativity previously stated, I truly found myself totally enjoying it. It was immediately engrossing, heart-rending, shocking, and being a cat-owner/lover, adorable!I liked the main character, her family ties, and although a few of her thoughts threw me off, I'd keep her just the way she is--REAL.Now this book goes to my sister-in-law (who I am sure will love it as well), and I will be looking for Number 1 in the series!!! Onward Dixie Hemingway!!"
4,Mystery & cats are a great combination,"Comparative behavior of cats and dogs is an added bonus to this Florida-based mystery. Although I figured out the killer early, I was tempted to change my mind with many of the red herrings. The pet sitter has odd hours, use of a dog's sense of smell, and access to empty homes which are plausible reasons to discover a crime scene and clues. Her characters are flawed and sympathetic for the most part. I look forward to the next Dixie Hemingway mystery."
3,Good...,"Okay- this book had a decent & at time page-turning plot, even though there were a few obvious mistakes that Dixie Hemingway (if a real seasoned ex-investigator/police woman as written) wouldn't have made(like feeding a cat before she called 911 after finding a dead body, allowing the cat to sully the crime scene). It was a very fast moving & easy read. The ending & some of the plot were a bit far fetched, as other reviewers have mentioned.The thing I didn't like about this book is in one chapter the main character is bad mouthing people who told her that her husband and daughter were, ""with Jesus"".?! The author at times seems to have some bigotry towards Christians. Also, if you're conservative about foul language & sexual preferences you might be offended. So, even tho I liked the pet sitter aspect of the book I wouldn't read another of the series."
2,Does this author dislike women?,"I admit that the writer's style was intriguing; however, her characterizations of women portrayed them all (with the exception of the sleuth) as at best uncaring to simply downright evil. I made it halfway through the book before I decided I could take no more. I can only think that the author had a horrible experience with her own mother and family and friends to write women so vilely. If not, then she is simply taking cheap shots. Either way is sad.I won't be buying and/or reading any more of her works again."
3,boredom killed the reader,"There is an excellent plot in this book. However, the descriptions of the day to day running of a pet-sitting firm are endless and better suited to a guide to starting your own business(half a page devoted to how she logs entries of the daily activities of each pet) or a how-to book for pet care (another half page describing how to brush a cat).Some of Dixie's actions also make no sense. She walks into a client's house and finds that the bedroom has been tossed. She decides to feed the cat before calling 911. Anyone who's ever had the police respond to a burglar alarm knows the drill - get to a safe place because the intruders may still be in the house. But this veteran ex-cop takes the cat into the kitchen for breakfast. These incongruities pile up and become very irritating.Dixie is a likeable character and the assorted pets are loveable. Again, the underlying plot is interesting. However, better editing is needed."
2,Confusing,"I abandoned this book (and author) with no regrets.Reason #1: Apparently the main character has some sort of big bad in her background that caused her to leave the police force and become a pet-sitter. There were hints and occasional surface explanations, but nothing that explained much. If this is to be a defining aspect of why the main character is who she is, then explain it - don't make me extrapolate.Reason #2: Weird writing style. Do I really care about cat anuses (mentioned more than once) or that the 'blessed air conditioning' made someone's nipples hard? Do I care that a medical professional had hairy knuckles and so by extension probably had a hairy back? What does this have to do with the price of eggs in Cincinnati?"
1,Just another smut offering,"Sorry, but I don't see any real merit to this book. Like Hemmingson's other work, it's typical smut fare disguised to look like something better. If I wanted porn, I'd read the cheesy stories they publish in Hustler."
4,Good for fans,Now I am not a fan of covering other bands songs. But this is not a true cover. They play the same sound as the original then the lyrics are all changed up. Moneen and Alexisonfire both put new songs on this that will be on there new cd which is great. They are both solid. If Alexisonfire sounds anything like there new song does on the new cd it was be big for sure. Give it a listen it is a good cd and for the money you arent going to beat it.
3,Moneen Slaughters,"Alexisonfire perfects the songs that werent theirs, moneen slaughters alexisonfire's perfect songs. It was painful to listen to aof's songs being played by a band lacking the talent to deliver justice. Aof on the other hand stepped up. You decide if it's worth it to spend some dollars and to hit the skip button a few times to pick up 3 good AOF songs."
3,alexisonfire isnt that good,"i wasn't ever a fan of alexisonfire, but i am a semi fan of moneen and their creativity in songs. This cd does make me respect alexisonfire's versions of their own 2 songs more.. probably because moneen's versions of them are better. hell moneen made accidents sound like it could of been a successful single. Yet alexisonfire basically disgraced the passing of america and made it unbearable..4 stars for moneens efforts2 for alexisonfire's_3 star"
2,Alexisonfire is incredible,"This is a great spilt. I wasnt really into Moneen, but they did great covers of Alexis and their new song is pretty dang good. Alexis delivers as normal. some of the best stuff of their genre, I really think they have one of the best sounds out right now. Check this out."
2,NOT THE BEST,"MY GOD! DO YOU KNOW HOW ARROGANT THE HERO IS? SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT HE HAS ENOUGH TO LAST HIM A LIFETIME. GOSH, THE HEROINE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE GUTS, BLUSHING ALL THE TIME. LIKE, YEAH, WHATEVER. IT WAS SICK TO HAVE TO READ THE PARTS WHERE THE HERO IS ALL TELLING HIMSELF THAT HE IS ALL THAT AND THAT THE HEROINE IS DEFINITELY ATTRACTED TO HIM. AHHHHHHH! I FEEL LIKE SCREAMING!"
5,Great extension cord for a generator,"I wanted a longer, heavy duty extension cord (12 gauge or better) for my generator but didn't want to pay the home improvement store prices. This cord is good quality and even has an illuminated plug so you can easily identify if and when the power is on. Very pleased with this cord and recommend it."
5,Great heavy duty extension cord.,"Bought this to use with my Wonder Winder Hand Crank Extension Cord Winder. I paid a little over $50 for this cord on Amazon.com, and it has not disappointed. The cord is very durable and yet not too stiff so it winds up nicely in the cord winder. The lighted end is a nice feature as well if you are working in a dark environment, makes it easy to locate. Overall, nice cord that I can see getting years of use and abuse out of. A+ item."
2,Cord wrap memory is horrible,"This cord is built tough! The lighted end is useful. It can easily handle being used by an electric mower. However, the cord wrap memory is a pain in the *ss. When you take the cord off the cord wrapper or real (separate purchase), the cord stays in a spiral shape and you must run our the entire length to untwist the cord. Same goes when you have to wrap it up, it tangles in on itself."
5,"Coleman Cable 02589 12/3 Vinyl Outdoor Extension Cord with Lighted End, 100-Foot",This extension cord is very durable and can handle any power equipment I could possibly connect to it. It is so bright that there's no way I would forget about it on the lawn. The end light is a nice feature.
4,"Solid, flexible with handy light feature",Well made and easy to coil (though I haven't used it in sub-freezing weather yet...that is coming. I like knowing the power is on (LED in female end) when I'm 50 feet away from the power source.
1,Does not deliver,Did not deliver enough current to run my air compressor while another 12 gauge cord did.
5,An Outdoor Extension Cord that goes a long way,"The Coleman Cable is one of the best I've ever had. The 100 foot length is perfect for electrical lawn and garden equipment. The Yellow color makes it easy for anyone to see, and steer clear of. I found it helpful to put it on a reel, for easy winding and storage. Would definitely purchase the product anytime I am in need of another one."
3,Not Totally Thrilled,"I bought this to go along with my electric lawn mower. I bought 12-gauge to make sure it delivered strong, steady power, but I'm second guessing the need given how heavy it is. This gauge in 100-foot length is weighty and takes some room. I was finally able to put it on a cord reel and it barely fit one designed for 125 feet of 14-gauge.The casing doesn't seem as durable as other cords I've worked with. The vinyl scuffed up roughly very easily on the first use. The plug ends are big and bulky, barely fits into the recess on the mower, and may not fit items that do not have a flat access. so BEWARE! I don't see the lighted feature as more than just a sales gimmick.I wish I could return it for a 14 gauge, but I'll keep it. Amazon packed it badly and the flimsy box was destroyed when it arrived. I'm just saying make sure you really need this length and gauge before purchasing."
5,Back to Basics,"Finally a good rock group that isn't totally commercialized. If you like Garbage's first CD, then you must have this CD. It is in a style similar to Garbage with lyrics that are just as good. This group hasn't been too influenced by money yet. This CD has a variety of moods: from slow and loving to fast and angry. The guitar is strong and heavy but Dahna Rowe's vocals burst right out of the background with an eerie sound. This was the most surprising CD I've bought in a long time. I promise it is worth the money. It will renew your faith in good music."
5,Platinum Holes,"A very impressive effort. Fresh, inventive, and ever changing styles make this cd a must have. Great production and my favorite cd of 2000 by far."
5,Excellent encyclopedia!,"No book about all the names, places, and events of the Middle Ages could be as this truly good and truly helpful as the Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages. Wanted to know who's who in the Middle Ages, this book's for you. Wanted to know what happened specifically in summary from the Middle Ages, this book's for you. Wanted to know how one group of people affected the entire European civilization, this book's for you. Everything you would like to know about the Middle Ages, this book's for you! It's comprehensively informative at the same time brief and appropriate. It can lead you to a broader subject in other books specifically related. This book is highly recommendable for everyone who love history, do research, study, and perhap write a book about a person, a place, or an event directly from this book.I, for one, prefer a paperback version instead of hardcover."
1,This would make a better tape than a DVD,"This is quite possibly the worst thing I have ever seen on DVD. This guy, who is extremely boring, stands there and talks about this whole big conspiracy, citing ""the internet"" as his all authoritative source. The way it is filmed is extremely annoying and consists of nothing but this guy in front of a dropcloth with two or three cameras that walk back and forth, zoom in and out, filming him. There is no footage of anything he talks about. Maybe it would be OK just to listen to but even that is a stretch. Don't waste your money."
1,Is this bag on the recall list?,I purchased this bag of dog food and then broke it up into smaller containers for freezing. I then threw the bag out.Now some of the bags have been recalled. I do not have the lot numbers I need to determine if my bag is on the list.Please forward that information as soon as possible. Thank you.
1,Recalled food!,"I recently bought this food, only to find that it was on the recall list (for salmonella). I had already put it in with some other food, all of which I will now have to throw out. Help me out, Amazon?"
4,Ancient history buffs will like this.,"From 4 BC to 418 AD, Baxter follows the legacy of two families from ancient Britannia led by a prophecy that proclaims from a ""God-as-babe"" birth to the dneath of an emperor. The brilliant interweaving of the lives of the characters and the relvance of the prophecy. As a history buff and a fellow writer of Roman Empire historical fiction, I recommend this book. Enjoy!"
2,"Why ""An Alternative History?""","I have finally finished the Emperor, book 1. I really do not understand why this is called an ""alternative"" history book.It seems that it follows history as we know it, except for the women who produces the first and then second prophecy.It was a wonderful insight to Roman Britain, some interesting characters that are not totally developed, but that was all.I was anxious to see if the second book would actually take us to a different history, but on reading the reviews, it seems not.Now, I will not continue with the series. It just wasn't what I wanted or expected."
3,"Interesting historical novel, but not very alternate","After finishing this novel, I noticed that there is a timeline in the front. I compared that to actual historical timelines. Um, where's the divergence?The premise of the novel is a strange prophecy. The characters revolve around the prophecy, but if you don't bother to do some reading up on history yourself then you won't notice where history is supposed to diverge.It is fairly engaging, with plenty of character development and historical accuracy. It doesn't fail to entertain, but it doesn't live up to its billing, either."
5,Love Knorr Garlic Herb Sauce and Amazon.com!,"We love the Knorr Garlic Herb Sauce and I use it in several dishes. Unfortunately the only 2 supermarkets in my city don't carry it. The store that did was bought out by Kroger and they don't carry it. I was really happy to find it here on amazon.com. I make a great bow-tie pasta dish using this sauce(+ grilled chicken, onions, etc.), in fact I made it last night..YUM! We haven't had this dish in months because I couldn't find the sauce mix anywhere. I tried other sauces and they just weren't as good. Knorr makes quality products and this is no exception.And have I mentioned I LOVE amazon.com? This is the second product that disappeared from my store shelves that I have found here. Thanks Amazon you save me time, money, and frustration!!!!"
4,This Toy is lots of Fun!!!,"I just got my Board Sharks R/C surfer.. I love it... Easy to control and it rips the little waves with it's body rotation components.. Very fun toy to take out to the reef, or beach breaks on a small surf day...On the negative side.. The battery doesn't last too long about 20 to 25 minutes..If you are planning on using it alot, you might want to invest on an extra battery.. Also, this toy requires a fair amount of maintenance, and propellers brake easily, so it's important that you run it on deep enough water..(it comes with 2 extra propellers), but investing in getting some extra ones it's probably a good idea...Overall, it's a delicate but super fun toy!!! This little dude can rip..and get some air too!!!!"
4,Fun Fun Fun,We had a ton of fun with the Surfer this summer in both lakes and at the shore. Defintely take care of him though... there is some maintenance required if you want him to last.
4,"Go for clear, not blue","Nice basic Pyrex loaf pan.I agree, however, with the other reviewer who pointed out that a CLEAR glass pan would make it easier to see the state of the product inside. Why didn't I think of that?? I was just drawn to the pretty blue color...but it's not like this item is displayed in my kitchen.I will pick up the pieces of my shattered life and move on. ;-)"
1,Bad Description,"If you are truly looking for a loaf dish that is 9 X 5, do not order this one!! I did, and I am so disappointed at Amazon for describing this as such. The measurements are actually 8.5 X 4.5!! I know Pyrex has made a 9 X 5 dish, and I was hoping this was it. Oh well, live and learn. But I will say that the $3.99 price is a good deal for an 8.5 X 4.5 dish - cheaper than Walmart."
1,One to skip,My daughter is an avid reader and likes pretty much every book she reads...the one exception was this book. She found it boring and she felt upset at the terrible things said about white people in it. It seems it just went too far into American Indian and new white settlers relations to be a fun read for a child. Perhaps it would be better enjoyed by an early high school aged reader.
3,Lots of Padding,"This has the hits like ""Creep"" and ""Ain't Too Proud To Beg"", but most of this CD felt like filler to me. It appears to be a lot of very minor hits mixed in with the monster hits. I did like that ""Girltalk"", the last major release that featured the late Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopez was included on the CD."
4,the only collection you need on them&It's Good,TLC were able to do what Salt&Pepa use to do Combine a Hip-Hop Vibe with a Pop&R&B Feel that had a Winning Formula.the Writers&Producers had as much to do with TLC as the Group Members did.there first two Albums pretty much have all the Jams that you need.RIP to LeftEye.the Re-Mixes&things don't add much.
4,"All the crazy songs, the sexy songs, and the cool songs.","Nice to have this collection finally get released. It should have come out in the states first anyway. Being a casual fan, and only owning ""Crazy Sexy Cool"" and ""Fanmail"", this collection was made for me. Included are the hits ""Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg"", ""Baby-Baby-Baby"", ""Waterfalls"", ""Unpretty"", and numerous others. A big plus is that this also has the rap version of ""No Scrubs"", and I really missed that on ""Fanmail"". I admit I'd like another track or two from ""Crazy Sexy Cool"", like their cover of ""If I Was Your Girlfriend"", but no big deal. Overall a great disc from one of the best acts of the 90's. Long love Lisa, and good luck to T-Boz and Chili."
5,Bionic Bunny Back to School Surprise,D.W. has the same book bag as Arthur. She learned her lesson from picking the same book bag as Arthur. I think you should read this book because it is funny!
2,how can you bend on the piano?,The whole essence of Jimis playing was in his bending. This album sounds like a bit of a joke. I have lots of piano albums but none capture the spirit of Jimi. Give us a break.
3,Just OK,"This game has a pretty cool concept, however, in the story board mode, it isn't much fun. Timer goes way to fast, and you must replay the scene several times to get it right (hope it's not just me). The rest of the game is OK, and even in story board mode it is, I'm afraid to say, a bit addictive."
2,It needs a lot of work.,"Eidos interactive didn't put enough effort into this game. This is one of the most boring games I have ever played! When you run into things you only see a small amount of sparks and you dont see any dents. this is just a really unrealistic game. I could find better graphics in a PS1 game. Don't even think about buying this game, if you do you're wasting your time.Graphics 2/10 - Don't even ask me.Gameplay 2/10 - Okay, but not great.Replay value 2/10 - It needs more options.Missions 1/10 - Not fun.Multiplayer 4/10 - It's okay, but won't hold your intrest.Story line 3/10 - Follows the movie.Bonus features 2/10 - Not worth seeing.Free roam 3/10 - The worlds are tiny and there are only 2.Controls 6/10 - Easy enough for anyone to understand.Music 3/10 - Nothing that makes you say wow.My final rating out of 100 = 28 / 100."
1,Boring Game,"I don't think I'm overstating my case when I say the only difference between this game and the PS1 game of the same name is the graphics. The original PS1 game had horrible graphics, but at least you could blame that for the horrible gaming experience. This game has nice graphics, but the game play is dull and annoying. You either have to race around too fast and miss the ending point, or you have to drive really really slow following someone who you cannot lose no matter what for four or five minutes at a time until your brain turns off. So, STAY AWAY, this game is a waste your life.."
1,"Buying Frangrance Online is ""Iffy""","I've loved the Niki fragrance for over 25 years and have had a hard time finding it as we live in a small town. Consequently, I have been without it for years. I was thrilled to come across it on Amazon and immediately placed an order. (It was my birthday gift to myself.) I was totally unprepared to find that the cologne I received was bad--as in rancid, past its prime, and not useable. I contacted Amazon and learned too late that by policy, frangrances are not returnable. Amazon kindly offered to give me a $10 credit, but I am still out money. It is a no-win situation for me and for Amazon (they didn't really cause the problem). In the future, I will be very aware of return policies and leary of buying fragrance online. Caveat Emptor my friends."
2,Fits on one CD!!!!!!,"The performance is good, and the sound is good (but hissy). Beefheart fans are serious, and I have no issue with recordings/performances that are not top notch being released, but I do have an issue with record labels (this time Morpheus) releasing an expensive ($35) double CD that could fit on one CD with about four minutes to spare. I feel I have been had. Some of the previous releases from this label have been quite good (one even boasted ""over 72 minutes playing time -- almost a double record""), but this is clearly a case of a label knowing that fans can, and will be soaked. To top it off, something as monumental as his last concert should have extensive liner notes, but they are virtually non-existent. Get it together Morpheus!"
1,Not worth the glass used to master it,"The fact of the matter is that this is a bootleg and a poorly mastered one at that. Ozit has mastered this all from inferior mp3s sourced from high gen tapes that have been circulating among Beefheart collectors for years.The show itself is a great show and although a lower gen mastering in HD isn't going to necessarily improve the fidelity of this audience recording. I still can't recommend this to anyone but completists who wish to collect every single release.This is definitely not a good place to start if you are looking to check out the music of Captain Beefheart. For that you are better off with something like Spotlight Kid, Clear Spot, Trout Mask Replica or Doc At The Radar Station."
4,Karcher Dirtblaster Spray Wand,Worked very well. It was a huge improvement in pressure over the standard adjustable spray wand I was using till now.
2,Just OK,"Got this watch for my wife for Christmas and it's band is already falling apart. Three weeks of semi-regular wearing should still look like new, not like it already needs a new band. It looked good Christmas morning, but I'll be looking for a new one by Valentines Day."
3,Would you believe that I never watched this movie before.,I love everything Clint Eastwood. And I like Westerns/cowboys etc. The story was simple. Not one of Clint's best. But I had to have it. No regrets. I collect his movies.
1,False Marketing,"This CD is false marketing and not the ""Essential Van Morrison"" as the title indicates. Aside from ""Brown-Eyed Girl"", this is NOT a collection of Van Morrison's well known tunes. Buyer beware."
5,Heavy duty for all purpose!,"I love these!! Ordered three sets of these brick-red colored mini-bowls for my family and continue to be pleased with the performance. They are good quality little things- used for yogurt, ice cream, nuts, little snacks for the kids- and are microwave oven and dishwasher safe. Try them for yourself- they come in a multitude of different designs. Kudos!"
5,Cute and Functional,I bought these as I was trying to find my pattern on the internet. I love them! They are great in the microwave and they match beautifully. Perfect for a small dish of ice cream or peaches or to put salsa in for snacking.
2,LITTLE UNSURE,"I bought this product to match my dishes, however, the quality just doesn't meet up to the Corelle name. These product doesn't seem to have the same durability as the plates & bowls in my dish sets. Out of 4 purchased, 2 have broken and 1 of the others has chiped. The kids love the size for applesauce and ice cream."
4,Almost perfect!,"The only reason these don't get 5 stars is because of their size. They are larger than they looked in the picture. They really are more of a small bowl than a ramekin. They are very cute however.CorningWare Corelle Coordinates 7-Ounce Ramekins, Cafe Black"
1,Picture used and actual color do not match,"I ordered these for my Mom who has several different items of the Corelle Coordinates. When they arrived, the color was no where close to the ones in the picture. The picture appears to be a bright, almost fire engine red color. In reality, it is a dull purplish-red color. My sister also bought the same set for our mother and again the cajun red was the same purplish-red and not the bright red in the picture. I can say that both sets did arrive undamaged and seemed to be packed well. The bakeware itself if very nice to use however, I'm rating it one star since the color wasn't even close to what I expected."
5,Have a different use every day!!,"These ramekins rate high at our house! They are substantial in weight and large enough so as to be very useful on a daily basis. A perfect size for a dish of oatmeal on the go; great for a cottage cheese and yogurt snack or quick breakfast; a first course cup of soup or a lunch of hot chili on a cool day; you can even end the day with a little ice cream before bed. Not only are they handy serving pieces, they are great for storage or microwave heating as well. Did I mention they look great, too! I don't have the matching dinnerware, but my kitchen has a blue theme, so the Cafe Blue fits right in! Go ahead, you need these ramekins!!"
2,Not what I was looking for,"I have a pretty complete collection of Edith Piaf on my IPOD, and I was looking for something that reflected her hits from the recent movie, La Vie En Rose, the soundtrack of which is also in my collection. I bought the book above and only recognized two songs as I was playing through all of them. I even went back and played the melody alone, hoping that would spur some recognition, but while some were pretty, they were not what I considered the songs that made her famous."
5,Reprint of original Piaf selection,Just great. Not a large book just ten selections you can see in description. Just fine for voice!
4,Opinions Vary,"And mine seems to vary from that of the Booklist reviewer, who thought the best stories were by the bigger authors such as Scarborough, Wolfe and Nye. Scarborough's was nice with lots of humor, Wolfe's was kind of tough to wade through though, and Nye's, well, I had to give up on it. A lot of the other so-called ""unimaginative and unpolished"" stories were superior to these."
5,Coleman Cable (extension cord) high visibility low temperature.,"This cord was all it was touted to be. I have used it four times with my electric snowblower, and it has functioned as advertised. It stays flexible even laying in the snow. Thanks for the recommendation."
5,"The Maker Is Absorbine, Not Cashel","This a great product, I just got the new one myself. There is a mistake in the description though. It says made by Cashel. Cashel makes fly masks, but they are totally different from Absorbine's masks."
4,Not for rough horses,"Well made fly mask, like that the horse has full visibility. However, it is not for horses that are rough in turnout. The ""ripstop"" fabric isn't rip-resistant."
5,Great buy,"These are a perfect liitle item to add color to the room, they made the room look complete and are a great buy, i am very pleased."
2,Possibly useful as a reference. Otherwise not.,"While this book covers a number of important topics, it's written in a telegraphic style that makes it useless for most purposes. It reads like someone's test prep notes, incomplete sentences and all. May be useful as a reference to someone with substantial prior mastery of the material."
5,The Ghosts Of Vietnam,"This is an excellent book, a poignant, sometimes funny, realistic, and down to earth honest look at growing up in rural America, and going to war.Jim gives us a rare look at the Vietnam war from a different point of view, with insights that will engage a broad spectrum of readers, especially those of us who were there!Thanks Jim for the memories!"
5,The Ghosts of Vietnam a good read,"This is not a story of combat, blood and guts or self proclaimed heros. This is a book about a young man's journey through Viet Nam. It will make you laugh. It will take you to the brink of tears. If you want to get inside the head of a man that's been there. Here is your book. It's a story about a man's love of country, fellow soldiers and a Vietnamese girl and of tragedy. As a Viet Nam vet I can relate to this book as I'm sure many other vets can. It's a good read and a good addition to any library."
5,The UNABRIDGED Invisible Man,"This Penguin Classics audiobook is actually a three-hour, two cassette UNabridged presentation of Wells' novel, despite Amazon's listing of it as ""abridged"".Paul Shelly gives an excellent reading. His narration is eloquent and melodious, and his remarkable voice talent captures the individual essence and quirks of each character. This rendition preserves every bit of the suspense and drama of Wells' classic moral tale of science without scruples, and it bears up well under repeated listening. I keep my copy in the car, and at times it has left me reluctant to arrive at my destination. Very highly recommended."
4,"a very thorough ""lay person's"" textbook for dealing with AA","This is a very informative book dealing with the many physical and psychological aspects of alopecia areata. Treatments are discussed as well as purchasing wigs, hats, etc. Having dealt with AA for almost 3 yrs. now, I found that there wasn't a lot of information that I didn't already know. However, the book has been helpful in helping friends and family learn more about AA."
4,Recommended,"I ""read"" this book as a book on tape. I found this book enjoyable to ""read"". If you want to read something interesting about clandestine spying in The US during WWII, read this! I think reading this book was ""time well spent"". Email:boland7214@aol."
5,Great book!,Excellent story behind the landing of two spies in America. Was a quick read do to the pace of the book. I never wanted to put it down. Highly suggest anyone interested in this period of history picking this book up to get an idea of what went on in this often unheard of side the Nazi attempt to win WW2.
1,fictional novel at best,"I have read this book as part of a research project about Operation Magpie. This book is filled with fictional accounts and statements almost from cover to cover. There are no footnotes because nowhere can the account of this story as told by the author be verified. My source of comparison is mainly official government FBI, Trial, and Prison files about this case."
1,Agent 146 defies credibility,"Erich Gimpel narrates Walter Mitty-like escapad-es, with absolutely no corroboration Characters are imply initials or phoney names. Some incidentsreported simply did not happen, such as a ""JoanKenneth"" knocking at the Military Commissionhearing room, asking to testify in favor of Gimpel. The record of trial and witness list show no such appearance. Also, it would have been impossible tobreach the security at Governors Island. So beware! There are many more fictions presented as fact. Hisaccount of his escape attempt at Leavenworth doesnot jive with the Bureau of Prisons account, whichled to his transfer to Alcatraz.The ""true"" story of a spy in America? Not in my book. There is no record that he sent a single message (transmitter was never assembled---FBI found the parts in a box after his capture).His performance for the Abwehr was consistent with the failure of German intelligence throughout WW II."
3,Fans of Sandi Patty rejoice!,"If you miss the Sandy Patti inspirational pop of the 1980s, you're in luck. Ric & Sara debut their self-titled album with a collection of tunes ranging in style from inspirational pop to gospel to worship. Sara's voice does sound remarkably similar to Sandy Patty, and together Ric & Sara are reminiscent of male/female duos such as Billy & Sarah Gaines or Steve and Annie Chapman. High points are ""Worship Medley"" and Sara's silky vocals, contrasted against generic songwriting and a lack of anything truly exciting musically."
3,"Not as good comparing to others, as it used to be 10 years back.","Time has gone by, since CW development was active.I regret buying this product. Borland only collects last pennies of it."
3,Interesting...,It's an interesting idea. Mix some of the classic Ike and Tina Tracks for clubs.The version of A fool in love is fun. The two other remixes are not worth listening to. Even when they are called millenium versions they sound dated.
2,Small power adapter seems underpowered,"Beware if you need to use this hub for higher power devices. So far, even plugged in to an outlet, this hub won't properly connect to my ipod dock (ipod connects then ejects over and over) or an external hitachi 2.5"" external drive (drive uses 2 USB connections to get power and signal - drive ready light keeps flashing on and off). When I plug these into my old Belkin 4 port hub, they work great...I attribute it to the Belkin's beefy power brick. So far, I've successfully used it to connect a USB flash drive and the aformentioned Belkin hub."
3,Product was not what I ordered,I ordered a car charger for my wife's phone (Snapper by Virgin Mobile) which was what the picture for the product I ordered displayed. When the product arrived - I noticed right away that it was the wrong charger. LUCKILY - the charger that arrived was the right one for MY Phone (Aloha by Virgin Mobile) - I Still don't have a charger for my wife's phone - so I had to buy her a new one!!!
2,Survival food,"Not too good. May be good if squeezed dry and added with mayo + crunchy veggies into tuna salad. I had this + crackers and the flavor was quite overwhelming. Very lemon pepper?!!?? Ha ha ha. I know, it is very lemon pepper but it is quite intense. I'll try as the base of a tuna salad, it may be better, but I think I'll sick with my plain ole' tuna. Worth a try if you are looking for something different, just not for me though. Texture was nice. Not to clumpy, but not overly processed and fine. Not terribly mushy."
4,Brings back old memories!!!,"I loved Pokemon blue,red,and yellow as a kid. One day I saw that you could download the games to your PC using an emulator called VisualBoy Advance. So obviously the first thing I downloaded was Pokemon yellow, my favorite out of the three. Once I beat it, I was DYING to watch this movie again. I looked on Netflix, WASNT THERE. So i love VHS tapes so i decided I would buy it right off amazon. This was a great choice on my part. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to find brand new VHS tapes anywhere anymore, but here is was. It is in perfect condition and it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Even if it is a kid's movie, its great to live out your childhood again. Highly recommended by me."
3,This Book is for Beginners Only,"I was a little disappointed at how basic the information is in this book. If you are completely new to homeschooling then it would be beneficial, but for those looking for a more content-rich guide with specific curriculum suggestions, this is not the best book to buy. The information is a very general guide to beginning homeschooling and the resource lists are not extensive, but they do include some good recommendations."
4,Homeschooling: The Middle Years,"This is a very informative book especially for first-time homeschoolers. It was well written and very well organized. The resources listed were very helpful.My only complaint was the unnecessary criticism of classroom teachers. Unless Ms. Henry was once a classroom teacher herself, I feel she is unqualified to claim that ""the most average high school graduate could produce average work in this not-so-challenging college major."" I was disappointed in this display of subjective writing in an otherwise well-written book."
2,Not for unschoolers,"I was disappointed reading this book, after enjoing ""the early years"" by Linda Dobson so much. This book assumes you are going to use some sort of curiculum. If you are interested in UNschooling (aka natural learning) - better get some other book."
2,Out dated poorly organized,"This book is basically statistics from 1 small survey. The information is presented in a less then readable manor. There are some good ideas thrown in here and there but I found it hard to sift through the commentary to pull that out.This book is outdated talking about video tapes (no mention of DVDs), audio refers to co and tapes but not mp3 players. No mention of accessing and reserving books over the internet for free from the library.She states there are 1000001 ways to home school but goes in to very little detail.The information presented in this book is antidotal and not based on any scientific studies. Although a couple of scientific studies are mentioned in passing.There is much better information on the internet for home schooling that is up to date and area specific."
1,Absolute waste of money,"I bought this guide after just 3 days of game play as there seems to be a derth of easy-to-access information in-game. This 'guide' is merely a series of data copied from the game screens and a number of screen shots. You don;t even get to enjoy the pictures in color - this book is entirely black and white on low quality paper.No information on tech trees, how to progress as a player (new or established), zero combat information....need I say more?"
2,"Good book, a tad outdated","I bought this strategy guide with the game when I bought it, and as soon as I installed the game I noticed the book was outdated. Most of the informaton has probably been outdated since the game was shipped, or shortly thereafter, although the historical stories are very interesting.EVE is an ever-changing game, and Prima needs to keep up with this changing."
3,Its a good guide for a love or hate game,"this mmo is SO immense and huge, you either love it because its its extreme complexity, or hate it because you need an MBA, and a PhD in quantum physics to get the full play factor out of the game. Super time intensive game, not enough immediate rewards, I didn't like it, but a lot of people do, download the demo and give it a shot. other then that, the guide was pretty helpful considering you need to know 10923801283 times more in this game, then you would for any other game in the history of the world."
5,I Just Wanted a Computer that Actually Works,"Hubba Hubba. I got home, took out the Mac, and within an hour, I'd already set it up, connected to the internet, surfed the web, and burned a music CD mix. The ads don't lie.A year ago, I gave in to pressure from friends/PC owners who told me I could get a faster, cheaper computer which ran all my software from work. It was definitely cheaper, but after a year of poor performance, regular system crashes, and difficulty performing the most basic tasks (like burning a CD or installing software), I moved back to Mac.I'd never tell anyone not to get a PC, but I would recommend this Mac if it's important to you to own a reasonably-priced, all-in-one setup that burns CDs and DVDs, has tons of style, and works well on a regular basis.p.s. I'm not really a 1 year old. well, maybe in terms of maturity..."
2,"Cheap, flat and not as pictured","While the photo displays a firm, voluminous and almost box-like shape with a clean pale aqua color, the actual product is dull brown and very flat without much expanding potential."
4,Great music,This CD is one of the great bedroom music type. Yet is just as good when driving home after a long day.
1,Wrong Item,They shipped some kind of pump actuator instead of the pictured cutting head cap. Useless part.SM.
4,I'm glad I bought this album,"The rapper of the ""third verse"" dropped this album in summer 2000 and not only does he let loose on wack emcees, but he also aims at such chart-toppers as N.O.R.E. and Memphis Bleek. He also attacks major-record labels on the title track produced by Pete Rock. Other highlights (and there are plenty) are ""R.N.S."" and ""Part of My Life"" (both produced by DJ Premier), the hysterical and playful ""MC's Come, MC's Go"" (no, you are NOT supposed to take that song seriously), ""Bumpy Knuckles Baby"" and the best track, ""The Mastas"" (produced by Foxxx himself, featuring M.O.P.). I couldn't give it five stars because I didn't care for ""Searchin'"" and also, all those songs about beating or shooting someone down start to wear thin after 70 minutes. But this album is still worth it for the song ""Bumpy Bring it Home"", where he says that his music ""is like the new Jordans when they come out."" I couldn't have said it better myself."
1,There is a problem with the disc.,"There is a serious problem with the disc. Let me be clear about one thing, it wasn't a problem with the seller I bought it from. But the disc is defective. There are only 3 tracks on it and there are supposed to be 20. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone because the chances are good that your disc will be faulty as well. This is the second time this happened to me.But let me say this, I found this album elsewhere and it's not bad. I wish Freddie would vary his style a little bit but there are some nicely produced tracks."
5,"Hip-hop as a force again, finally","Bumpy knucks delivers the good brother. This album challenges rap's satus quo in an atriculate yet brutal way. The beats are ill and foxxx's rhymes never falter. Foxxx's tirades actually leave the listener believing that is capable of the brutality he speaks on, providing a sense of realism to the entire album. Get it."
3,I love Freddie but not this CD,"OK enough of the lauding support for unsigned rappers on the come up. Freddie Foxxx has been a industry mainstay, you can here him Dropping classic lines on any one's CD from De La to Gangstarr. The fact remains that while Freddie can anchor a song with his raw voice and delivery, his lyrical content is at most slightly above par. So even though I wanted this LP to be a classic I was not shocked when I found that I grew tired of his voice and his same delivery about 4 songs in.I may have listened to it completely once and since then it has gone on my Busta Bust rack of never listen toos. Buy this album to support Freddie, don't buy this album because you want a good CD."
4,Not as good as I had hoped,"This was a good CD, but not one of the great ones that has me listening to it nonstop for weeks. I was hoping for something more along the lines of Waterbone's ""Tibet,"" and was somewhat let down. I did enjoy this CD, though, it's lovely, but it seems a little... lackluster."
5,Love It!,"I got this 3-disc set of fun and silly songs as a gift when my daughter was a baby. She is almost 5 and still loves it. The upbeat traditional nursery rhymes (and a few that aren't) with a twist are fun for both of us to listen and sing to. I like the exposure she gets to different styles of music and rhythms, and it makes it more fun for me too. Lyrics were included on my set, but I knew most of the songs already. I just needed to get used to the different musical interpretations them. I am buying copy for for my expectant friend. If you are looking for a CD of lullabies, this is not it. Check out the samples and hear for yourself if you are not sure."
1,BAD PURCHASE,Got this item as a gift. The tunes are not the tradidtional tunes which makes it impossible to sing along with the baby.
5,Heavy-duty but surprisingly lightweight,"This extension cord is heavy-duty but weighs MUCH less than its comparable peers. If you're dragging it around along with a vaccuum or other heavy items it's nice and easy to carry. The lighted end lets you know there's power, which is a nice feature."
4,"Solid, durable",Great extension cord that is durable and fits on my cord storage wheel. Love the lighted end that helps with evening use. Glad I purchased this one.
5,Colour!!,I bought this to go with a marvelous electric lawn mower!! Highest quality - the kids drag it around quite a bit! Terrific bright colour - they are able to easily see it and therefore not mow over it!!! Thank You!
4,AN English Adaption of A Puerto Rican Legend,Juan Bobo is an enjoyable story of a negligent shepard named Juan Bobo (Bobo- fool in spanish). After all the kings soldiers fail to stop a mysterious being from trampling the kings fields at night. Juan is sent ont the fourth night to prove that he can out do the king's soldiers and capture the mysterious tresspasser. This great tale of Juan's attempt at proving he is not a fool will leave you hanging on the edge of your seat wondering what kind of trouble he'll run into next.
5,Great water bottles,"These glass bottles are perfect for work or home and store almost a quart of water or other beverage. The wider mouth make them perfect to drink directly from, and you can easily keep track of your water consumption. I know they're originally made for canning, but everyone tries to keep hydrated, and these bottles are convenient and attractive."
4,Lovely but a little pricey,"Almost $4 each is a little pricey for a glass bottle, but these are nice due to the design. Before they became popular, they used to sell on Crate & Barrel for half this price. Shucks...should have picked them up then. I bought one case on Amazon. Side by side, there are some noticeable shape differences in the bottles. Nothing that would keep me from buying them again. I use them for home-brewed iced tea. I've moved away from plastics and use mainly glass for food storage now. Seems safer."
5,"Nice bottles, but not cheap.","These are great for their purpose, and although a bit more spendy than regular mason jars, they also are 30% narrower, which is perfect for fridges with smaller footprints."
2,Hit & miss,I purchased these jars to make homemade vanilla this year. Several of the lids were dented & three of the jars were cracked. Many of them had scratch marks on them. I was surprised because they were packaged very well. I ordered another box just in case this was a bad one. The new box had many of the same problems. I would not order these again even though I love the look of them. I salvaged what I could & sent one box back.
2,NOT Freezable,"Two of these shattered in the freezer. I used them to store and freeze soup, and none survived!Maybe I should have left more room for contents of the bottle to expand.. not sure what the problem was."
3,Good cover but smaller than advertised,These covers are good...for people with small feet. It is not practical for maintenance people coming to your home. Really hard for a men size 11 tennis shoe let alone a work boot.
1,PLEASE KEEP MY CARPET CLEAN!!!!,"I hoped that these would do the trick, but sadly, no. I need to enter my clients homes and pick up pets and take to truck. I found that these were hard to get on. Timely! And seemed small - I wear size 8(female). Easier for me to kick off athletic shoes and retie on exit. Wish they had more elasticity for on-off speed. Not worth the effort. Bummer. But at least I try to keep my clients' carpets clean! It would be nice if somebody out there would make this an easier task!!!"
2,Not Large Enough,I bought the shoe covers mainly for repairmen and these are way too small to fit over most all men's work boots.
4,These are OK,These are OK..I have somewhat normal size feet [men] and these fit OK..Appears to be the same material as another brand I bought from amazon:Lab Safety Disposable PPSB Shoe CoverBut I like these better for fit (and they appear to be more contoured to fit better too)..I was wanting something to wear thru airport security..bobbler
2,Too small,"They are simply too small. I was looking for shoe covers, these do not cover a lady's size 7 shoe."
2,Cancer concerns with warning on this item!,"Upon opening, these really offgassed heavily into my home to the point I had to set the basket outside. Looking into it further, you will notice the fine details that say on the Amazon listing description that this product contains chemicals known to the state of CA to cause cancer or other reproductive harm! YIKES."
4,Sturdy and inexpensive,These are exactly what we were looking for. We remove our shoes before walking on the new carper and when we leave we sometimes have to run back to retrieve something we forgot. These allow us to leave our shoes on for that brief trip. They are easy to slip on over shoes and can be reused many times. Would recommend this product to anyone.
5,Wish they were a bigger size,"My friends don't all have the same foot size. For men these are too small.However, great shoe covers, easy to put on, and take out. Great hand out for guests. Great price, too."
2,opening too small,My employees found that the opening to get their shoes in was too small -- and my employees are women and do not have big feet. The quality itself of the product was okay but we just had problems with them ripping when trying to get their shoes inside.
2,This is for women only runs very small,"I have house cleaning people coming to my house; man and woman, but the man had difficult to wear these because they run so small, and with runnning shoes(his feet was not that big,) but barely could fit, almost tearing these covers. Most of people work houses like repairmen or handymen, have thick work shoes or boots, if their foot size is more than 8 or 9, it will be difficult to wear. These covers are really good for women I think, but not for mens.I want to get much bigger ones for them to fix or clean my home."
2,Cheap price cheap quality,"Just proves that you get what you pay for. The shoe covers do not hold up too well. Furthermore, they are listed as large but do not fit over my size 9 sneakers. I have to really stretch them."
3,These work...for small feet.,"I purchased these when we installed new carpet. I ask anyone who doesn't want to remove their shoes to wear them. They work fine for me (women's size 8), but the furniture delivery men weren't able to make them fit. I think anything larger than a women's size 9 and they just aren't going to fit."
3,For Small Feet,"I was worried about the mixed reviews on the size but I bought them anyway. They were way to small. The shoe covers are suppose to fit a size 10 in mens however, they do not. I am a ladies 9 and they would not fit me. Be cautious of the size you need. As far as how well the work. I'm not sure.. I can not review that part because they do not fit anyone in my house.Edit to this review to say... Ok, This is weird but, turn the shoe covers inside out and they will fit! I have no idea why but, it works! My husband can even get them over his Military Combat boots..Size 10."
3,Too Small,I should give them a one because they are too small for my work shoes but I gave them to my daughter-in-law who can use them in her work.
4,Handy for repair people,I bought these to hand to repair people that were expected after buying a new home with hardwood floors. The only problem is getting some of them to put the protection on.
3,"Ok, but not the best quality","Before purchasing on Amazon, I shopped around, I wanted the best quality for the price. I'm a size 9.5, tight but doable. If you have larger boots, may not fully fit. I wish they were a little thicker and heavier. After a few light uses, they are ready to be tossed."
3,"O.K., So It's A ""B"" Movie","A run of the mill ""B"" movie that has one thing going for it, Ben Murphy. Maybe he couldn't save the college campus from an alien mummy, but he saved this movie from being a total disaster. If you like this type of horror genre (and I do) you will accept this for what it is and enjoy it as such. Grab the popcorn and settle in for a dark evening."
5,Extol does it again!,"OOhh man, what a CD!Even though past songs from Burial andMesmerized seem more refined, these ones are much moreaggressive. [...]This is a great CD, buy it."
4,Righteous Death Metal that works,"This is proof that death metal doesn't always have to be about evil things. This swedish death metal band did good on this cd. This is the first time i ever checked out an extol cd, And i must say, I'm pretty impressed. They even made good use of violins on this cd! Extol makes great melodic death metal that should be pleasing to all metal fans. The best songs of the album are ''Of light and shade'' [The best song on here], ''A structure of souls'', ''Ember'', ''Renewal'', and The title track. Some christians wanna critcize bands like Extol for embracing death metal, Being that death metal is known for being music about satan. Extol is a good band. And i might conisder buying another Extol cd someday, Being that this one was good to me. Death metal fans should love this cd."
1,Haha.,"""Extol is far heavier and far more brutal than lame bands like Meshuggah, Theory in Practice, and the Dillinger Escape Plan! Extol towers over all metal bands. For even heavier stuff try Sympathy, Crimson Thorn, Tortured Conscience, Disencumbrance, and Vomitorial Corpulence!""What an idiot. First of all this isn't even close to being heavier than Meshuggah, Extol doesn't have a comparable guitar tone to Meshuggah (see Chaosphere for an example of sheer heaviness). I don't think the reviewer who wrote what you see above has ever heard Theory In Practice if he doesn't think they're heavier or more technical. TiP makes Extol look like beginners, so don't listen to this moron. Bands like Meshuggah, Textures, Theory In Practice, Necrophagist, Cryptopsy (last 2 albums), are what real technical/brutal metal is all about."
2,RIDICULOUS,Good music/musicians with stupid lyrics.Black Metal for christians is utterly ridiculous.
5,Metal at its best!,"When I first heard about Extol from friends, I had no idea that they would be this good. This CD is 57 minutes of the best metal I have heard in a long time, in fact its one of the only metal CDs I have that I can listen to front to back without skipping any songs. Peter Espevoll does a great job with the vocals, and the guitaring is absolutly amazing! Some of the strongest Christian metal I've ever heard, right up there with Zao and Living Sacrifice."
5,Amazing,"This is a very heavy album. Fast and techinical, strings are even used in a few songs to keep the melodies intact. Although extremely heavy, the songs are still beautiful, and are distinctly different from the previous songs. Ole sings with clean vocals for part of a few songs, while Christopher screams with such passion and intensity. The drumming is amazing, guitar work is amazing, every thins is amazing. This is one of my five favorite albums ever."
5,good stuff,"I know this isn't ""THE FASTEST"" or ""THE MOST TECHNICAL"" or ""THE HEAVIEST"". IT IS JUST PLAIN GOOD MUSIC !!!Give me a break people. Stop crying about how fast it is or what ever. Who cares about what other bands may be ""MORE WHATEVER"".Music is good or it's not, PERIOD. These guys are good and I really respect there music. I like the production and sound quality also. They are from Sweeden and we all know so much good metal in general comes from the Nortic area.Good Stuff guys."
4,"Excellent, technical extreme metal.","This is pretty incredible stuff. My first inclination was to describe Extol as black metal, but that really wouldn't be an accurate description. While their music contains elements of black metal, there is a combination of death metal and classic metal as well... which makes for some pretty original and brutal music. The vocals are exremely well done, ranging from brutal, blackened death vocals to the excellent clean vocals of Ole Borud, who sings right on par with the likes of James Labrie (Dream Theater) or Lance King (Balance of Power). The music is astounding in terms of songwriting and technical ability: complex, intricate riffing, tons of time changes, stellar drumming, and top-notch tight playing as a whole. Here and there songs are a bit drawn out, which tends to detract from the intensity, though not enough to stop me from listening repeatedly. Fans of high-tech death, black, or thrash metal should find this album to be highly enjoyable."
3,Celtic Night Sleeping Moon Bracelet,"Bracelet is pretty enough but not very durable. Wore it daily for a month. I tend to find a piece of jewelry I like and just wear it for various lengths of time. This one broke beside the moon. I knew it was pewter and soft, but this is real soft. I make jewelry myself and the break was a thin spot in the braid connection to the moon."
1,Milwaukee Road Passenger Service: From the Hiawatha to Amtra,"I waited many months for this book and I am disappointed. The photos are grainy/blurry and better photos exist in other books. The text is mainly equipment lists and schedule times from timetables. And, the prooreader should be fired. There are spelling errors throughout and photo captions appear under wrong photos. My copy will probably be sold on eBay."
2,"You Will Want To Like This Book, But...","Sadly, I must agree with the other reviewers who have taken the author and publisher and proofreader (apparently, though, there wasn't one) to task for the MANY mistakes in this effort.If you desire information about The Milwaukee Road's passenger trains, any of Jim Scribbins' books would be a better choice.I waited over a year for my copy of this publication, but realized the book was in trouble when I saw the heading for the section on train #s 9 & 10, the famous overnight run from Chicago to Michigan's upper peninsula. In this book it's called The Cooper Country Limited!I have enjoyed Mr Dorin's writing in the past, but this is below his standards."
2,Faucet Spout popped in two after 2 years of use,"I really liked the look of this faucet and was very happy with it at first. But after only 2 years, the top part of the faucet separated from the bottom half. Apparently they are held together by a small allen-head screw in the back that had come loose. I took apart the entire faucet to see if I could push it back in, but it won't go back together. Because of the shape of the spout, it's pretty much impossible to get any leverage to push them back together. I even put the parts in my shop vise, but the metal started to give way and the parts just won't go back together. Very disappointing. After only two years, I need to buy a new faucet. This wasn't worth it."
2,This is not a toy. It is a filter for the filtration system for a swiming pool.,The item was shipped promptly and was what was ordered. The filter has been in for 3 or 4 weeks and seems to working just fine. The savings from buying on line vs. local retail store amounted to about $70.00. Well worth the effort of going online to place my order.
1,False advertising,"Received an off brand filter cartridge, Aqua Kleen AK-8004. While it was the same size and fit, it was immedately apparent it was lighter duty and not as well made as the Unicell filter it was replacing and what was advertised."
5,SATISFIED,Great filter does the job and it's inexpensive compare to others. Would definitely buy another one in 6 months when is time to change.
5,Great Product,"Very pleased with this product it was just as described by seller and worked perfectly. I was overdue for a new cartridge and notice immediate results. Seller was very quick to respond to my emails and answered all my questions prior to ordering. I would recommend ordering from this seller, the price was half what I could buy it for locally."
2,cool,i love it as a key chain but some kid took the little peice from me but i still like how realistic it is.
5,Need a great book to read? ~ JMR,"The Other Side of Dark was awsome! It has everything you could ever want in a book. If you like romance, thrilling suspense, mystery, this book has it. Joan Lowery Nixon is a writing genius. To tell the truth, normally reading bores me, but this book made me want to keep reading. or in my case listening. It is about a girl named Stacy, who gets shot along with her mother, but only one lives. once Stacy wakes from her coma, she learns about the death of her mother. Angered by this she wants the killer dead. but will her plan prevail? Next bookreport, or if you personally love to read, go to the library and get it. I loved it and you will too!!!!!!**HAPPY READING**"
3,The Other side of the Dark,"The book that I'm reading is called the other side of the dark.it is very interisting and good too. It about this girl named Stacy. she has been in the hospital for over 40 years. because she doesn't now where she is at. She thinks she is a very young girl.She doesn't now that her Mother's died she thinks she is alive. Stacy always talks about her mom. with her friends and stacy friends also say We'll where is your mother. and stacy doesn't now where her mother is.Then Stacy wakes up in a Room that's not hers, in a body she doesn't regonize, to discover she's been in coma for over four years. Her mother is dead -murdered and stacy. recovering from a gunshot wound is the only eyewiteness. to her mother murder. she can recall the killer is not about to let her reveul his indentifty.Ruth Gallegos"
3,The Other Side of Dark,"Thirteen year old Stacy McAdams wakes up in a room that she does not reconize, she is very confused and her leg is sore. She soon finds out that she has been in a coma for four years due to a gunshot to her leg. Her mother is dead, and the killer is still out there. Without having anytime to recover the killer is back in her life trying to stop her from identifing him by any means necessary. She is receiving calls from the killer. Now Stacy has to watch her back everywhere she goes and trust no one but her family. I think this book is very good and I would recommend it to any young adults who like mystery novels."
5,The Other Side of Dark,"This is the best book i have ever read. It is suspensful and exciting from the first page. It is a thrilling novel by Joan Lowery Nixon. If you enjoy going to bed scared, I would reccomend reading it at night! This book is about a 17 year old girl, Stacy, who has been in a coma for four years. After waking up, she finds out that her mother was shot and killed. Her goal in the book is to find her mother's killer. This book is the best. I love it!"
4,4 stars in the dark,"Imagine what it would be like to fall into a coma when you're thirteen and wake up when you're seventeen to realize that you're the only one who can get vengeance on your beloved mother's murderer. And then there's also having to get used to a new body and all the major changes that can happen in four years. I was really into it up until the killer was revealed. It was still good after that, but what I thought would happen didn't. In my opinion, the ending could have been a little better, but other than that, I thought it was a really great book. I recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery, suspense, and romance."
4,heres my review by stephen m ms.o,"Stacey has just woken up from being in a coma for 4 years. She was shot and this caused her to go into a coma. She was 13 years old when she was shot and now she's 17 years old. She has the mind of a 13 year old when she wakes up but is in a 17 year olds body. She finds out during the break in that her mother was shot and killed. Stacey keeps trying to remember the killers face but can't. Stacey meets a bot named Jeff who's nice to her but mysterious. Stacey soon meets her mothers killer at a party, Jarrod, he triesto kill her but Jeff saves he. Jarrod is soon taken into custody. Will Jarrod come and hurt Stacey in some way? Who exactly is Jeff? To find out more read the book. I felt this book was a great book for young teens to read. It was very thrilling and exciting. It always kept me on the edge of my seat."
5,Kara's Other Side of Dark Review,"This book was about a girl named Stacey, who was shot and put in a coma for four years. Her mother was killed by the same shooter. When Stacey wakes up from the coma she has no idea what happened, then she starts to remember certain parts of the murder. She can remember anything, except the murderer's face. She is determined to see it. While all this is happening Stacey has to deal with missing four years of her life. She has gone from being thirteen, to being seventeen. She doesn't understand the new styles, and all of her friends are in highschool.Stacey does see the murderer's face, and takes him to trial.I thought this book was really good, and I reccommend it to anyone over eleven."
3,good,I thought this book was very good. I guessed who was the killer and the truth about anoter chacter before I finised it. however i like the way stacy is sturggling to grow up. she is very cluless about somethings.i what to read more of the authors books.
3,Review( The Other Side Of Dark),Stacy went to look for who killed her mom but she could not remember who shot her and her mom so she started getting visions about the day she was shot then she went to find him and she found him.
3,The Other Side of Dark,"The book was well enough written for a younger adult, meaning somebody in their very early teens or perhaps even younger. I belong to a mystery book club and we all agreed it is not something for an adult."
5,What like about The Other Side Of Dark,The Other Side of Dark Is the best book I have ever read a real page turner. The book is about a girl named Stacy who was followed home one day and followed into her house. The man shot her mother and her she was put in a coma but her mom was killed which Stacy has yet to find out. When Stacy wakes up she has to jump into the life of a seventeen year old girl. And start what seems like the never ending search for her mother's killer. I would stay up really late just to see what would happen next. But there were specific parts that I liked the most. Like the slow discovery of who Stacy really is. And how they make it seem like Jeff is the killer. I like how detective Markowitz is always there for her when she needs him. I think it is really exciting when Stacy and Jarod are in the tree house and how it falls with Jarod in it injuring him. I think it is really romantic when Stacy tells Jeff that he is her first love.
5,"""Exciting, page-turning book""",Stacy wakes up from coma after 4 years. She finds out that she is then 17. Her mother is dead. Stacey is so mad at the person that killed her mom that she would almost kill...
5,You HAVE to read this book!!!,This was my favorite of Joan Lowery Nixion's books! From the moment I started reading it I was hooked. It has a mix of romance and spine tingling- suspense. A real page turner. If you've never read one of her books this is the one to start out with.
5,A TERRIFIC COMPANION BOOK,"After seeing ""The Artist"" I got very interested in silent films. My grandmother was a huge fan of Valentino's so I sort foused on the very talented and tragic Valentino. My grandmother (who played piano scores to silent films right into the early 30's) always said it was very difficult for her to stay focused on playing when Valentino was on the screen. But it wasn't Valentino that literally stopped the music, but Lon Chaney, Sr.'s being de-mased in the ""Phantom of the Opera"" that maybe caused a ""swoon"" that caused her to slip off the piano bench. She'd laugh when telling me of this, as no one noticed the music stopped! ""The Valentino Mystique"" is filled with facts, and an excellent source of information. It so helps to better understand how this very young man manged in just nine years to make such an enormous impact. Really, almost a full 86 years after his passing, I've read and am reviewing a book written about him."
2,Rob Kling's Computerization and Controversy,"Rob Kling has created a seven-part book of issues that surround the integration of technology into businesses and education. He validates his beliefs with case studies and testimonials from experts in their respected areas. Kling begins each chapter with a very thorough overview of the section.Don't let the size of the book intimidate you; the material is well prepared and easy to read. My advice is to pick and choose chapters and sections within those topics that are of interest to you. Keep in mind that a lot of the material in the book is ""out dated"", which caused me some cognitive frustration. The book was written in 1996 and I surmise from the preface that it was conceived in the early '90's. Topic titles are revenant to Computerization and Controversy but the case studies are only useful as a historical prospective.JCalhoun"
4,Great Music from Parker and Co.,"I first heard William Parker with David S. Ware and Matthew Shipp and was impressed with his playing. He shows here that he is an excellent composer too. This album has some great playing, especially on the three foundation tracks. I hadn't heard Daniel Carter before this, but he is a great sax player. A lot calmer than Ware but very lyrical and interesting. Parker is in excellent form throughout, powering the music along like an avant-garde Charles Mingus. This really is an excellent album and adventurous listeners should definitely check it out."
5,Native Sons,"This is a great CD with some hard rock feel to it. This CD is so good that I don't have a favorite on here, but I think the best has to be ""Face to Face"" and ""Dance With Somebody."" I would recommend this to anyone, especially to fans of AOR, Hair Metal and Hard Rock."
1,"Paid for this, lost my money","I bought Poker Academy Pro 2.0 online and like it so much that I bought the other software by the same company (Prospector). Recently I re-installed my operating system and had to re-install everything. For my big surprise, when I tried to register Poker Acedemy it didn't work because it requires a online registration and the company that used to sell it doesn't exist anymore. I lost my money!!!!! I bought, I paid for it, but I can't use it."
5,Excellent book,"I need to take the time to say this is a wonderful book. I work in the expressive arts when doing therapy with youth and found this book to be informative. This book is simple that it talks about how to use therapy and the expressive arts as a form of healing for the client. Straightforwardand very easy to read. You will enjoy it.It shows a difference between art therapies in which seek to look at the work and try to figure out its meaning. Expressive arts explained in this book states...only the client can say what they feel about what they do. I agree.I recommend this book to expressive arts therapist, expressive arts faciliatators, and counselors who want to learn how to use the expressive arts in their own work."
5,this book is wonderful!,"The easy to read format, helpful suggestions and insight into creative expression is priceless. I am so glad I purchased this book!"
4,CEU Credits,"Would you believe that Natalie is Carl Roger's daughter? I did not know that and there was an autograph inside cover. I used this for CEU credits towards LPC continued credits.Since I use art therapy, I was interested in her approach. Not everything she experiences herself is applicable to the room with the client.Book would have been better if written for 'clients' than about the author's experiences but I do suggest others to read it and see what is applicable."
5,Entertaining and quirky,"These old Bull Cook Books are fun reading. George Herter had a very strong opinions about everything and anything, and he spins some story or piece of advice around every recipe. If you are the sensitive type, you may want to pass. Remember this was written 50 years ago by a man who formed his views 50 years before that, so contemporary standards of PC should not be applied. My family loves to get these books out for group readings. We laugh til it hurts."
5,Inspiring Animated Cartoon You'll Love,"One of the best animated 30 minute vids on the market and with wonderful songs and animation by the Don Bluth Team, this is a video that you and your children will watch over and over again."
5,Childhood Memory!,"I used to watch this and ""Rikki Tikki Tavi"", and ""The Last Unicorn"" all the time when I was little and I loved it. I've always been a big fan of cartoons, because cartoons is where I taught my self to draw, and I really like this cartoon because I liked the characters, and I always liked thoes three glamour cats..I used to draw them a lot. This is just a good movie for kids."
2,"""Banjo the Woodpile cat""","I got this movie for my son and also because my wife is a 2nd grade teacher. I thought it would be good for the kids when the school has movie days, before the holidays/vacation. This movie was a huge disappointment. I thought it would be along the lines of ""The White Seal"" or ""Riki-tiki"", boy was I wrong. It was like someone got up one day while still in their under-wear and wrote something down because they had to meet some deadline. One would do better just recording old ""Tom & Jerry"" episodes from regular television. We had to force ourselves to get through it and then I was appalled at how bad the ending actually was. No wonder I had never heard of this movie before.Well, thanks for reading my review."
3,Useful as extra headphone jack but loud...,"I bought this because I was running iDeneb on my netbook and I had no audio drivers for it. I also used it on my desktop as a headphone jack for my usb port since I didn't want to reach down to the back to plug in my headphones on the computer. The only problem I have with this ""sound card"" is that the volume is too loud on it. On the windows PC I have to set it to 1 / 100 to get a decent non-deafening sound. On the mac I have to play with both the playback app and the system sound (since the system sound doesn't go as low as the windows setup. It also doesn't have a hybrid mic port like some of the others. So it costs a bit more...it looks really nice but overall if I had to do it again I'd get something else. It doesn't have noisefeedback or anything though so the sound is clean if you make sure you set it to the lowest setting before hitting play, you'll be fine with this model."
5,What deal!,"This is essentially an external sound card with some fancy sound management software, for a very low price. I used it to bypass the existing, broken sound electronics on the mother board. Worked well and worked immediately. I've got two of them. Highly recommend."
3,Hmm,This was easy to install and I loved having sound again. Unfortunately every time I use it I get the dreaded blue screen and my computer shuts down. =(
2,"Cool device, TERRIBLE customer service.","This is a decent product. I bought it because my sound card blew out. The only thing I didn't like about the product itself is that you cannot use a 1/8 splitter. I have 2 sets of speakers that I had plugged in with my regular sound card using a Radioshack 1/8 splitter. When you plug the splitter into the device, only one set of speakers will work. Other than that, the product is great and a real life saver if your sound card blows.The main issue I have with the company is that I bought the product and a few days later there was a $2 price drop. I emailed the company and asked for the difference and I never got a response. By law in the state of Michigan, if you buy something within 30 days and the price drops, you have the right to receive the lower price. Now even if that's not the law everywhere, its still good customer service. I won't buy anything from this company ever again."
1,Whats this?,"I bought this item but it does nothing for me so I sent it back. The sound card installed in my PC is just fine. I can not tell you anything about this items funtion but can say ""it will not solve sound problems that do not really exist"". Buy a good speaker system and go from there."
4,it ok,The sound quality is better than the in built i have. i havent used the surround sound until today and it seemed decent tho only tried it with a 5.1. i tested it with a 7.1 audio demo too but it wasnt that good...it works.... and sound quality is better. i might edit this when i use it a little more under surround sound situations.
3,Willing to work with us,"The CD for the product arrived damaged. The company was willing to exchange the product. My son was able to use it and didn't feel it was worth paying for the return,"
2,Lou Ferrigno is heavy on sword- fighting in this film.,This movie is narrated as being told to a child. Lou FerrignoThe Incredible Hulk - The Complete First Season) plays Sinbad who must conquer the evil Jafar. He must also rescue the Princess. Lou Ferrigno's voice sounds like it is dubbed by someone else. Cheap special effects. Quick enough moving story but you can miss something if you go to the kitchen to grab a sandwich. Lots of sword-fighting.
1,So bad it's fun to watch,"This is probably the worst movie for continuity errors I have ever seen (on the original VHS release, the back of the box had a different plot than the movie!). I always hoped MST3K would get hold of it, but it's worth buying for your own personal MST3K party! The acting is so overdone (""Budge!""), the situations are so ridiculous, and the voiceover so eggregiously horrible that it's a non-stop laugh. I mean, where else can you find a Chinese Samuri? My friends and I quote from it all the time.After looking at the Poe story it's supposed to be based on -- well, they both have Sinbad in them... though the movie is by far Sinworse."
5,FANTASTIC!!,"Great film, has to be seen to be believed. About as near perfect a movie as you could ask for. Don't worry if you are not really into sword & sorcery type films, this will blow you away anyway. You will be enthralled from start to finish. Classic!!"
3,Not quite what I was looking for,This book has beautiful photographs of Trompe L'Oeil and it does offer a few explanations on projects but it's more photos then anything else. It gives a good stone wall and sky project explanation and a few small projects but it doesn't give any information on a lot of the photos. If you are a beginner I wouldn't recommend this one. Very few templates offered for the amount of projects they illustrate. I hoped for more with this book but it's just not there. I think I could of found a better book for the money.
3,Good and Just Okay,"There are certain items in the book I think are great, and there are some that are just so-so. However, I love trompe l'oeil and can certainly use the information provided."
4,"A very good overview, well-written and well structured book.",The cases studied are very updated and they analyze several situation at many countries(on unusual economics situations).
3,Not a fan of Longyear,"Maybe its just his writing that bothers me, but I just cannot imagine the characters acting the way they do in this book."
2,Not very helpful.,I am not too pleased with the usefulness of this text for teaching Social Studies Methods. The book gives many examples of teaching methods for social studies but the book lacks depth or how-to-ness. Okay for a general overview but not much substance. It lacks an overall philosophy or guiding theory. Students reading this text are left to sort through a variety of methods and come to their own decisions about what will work and not work in the classroom. I would rather have seen more of what the current research suggest about teaching than leaving all of the sence making to the reader.
3,Textbook,It's fine if you are being forced teach Social Studies. Has the info that you need to write lesson plans and it's arranged well. I just HATE social studies so it's hard for me to give a high rating to any product that is in that subject vein!
2,Serious problems after 2 years,"Bottom line for me here is only one thing - after 2 years of usage (about 2.5 to be precise), picture disappears (then reappears and so on), producing show interruptions almost every 5-10 minutes. New unit was OK."
5,Unbeatable!,"I agree with everyone here that this TV will blow you away. I work for an A/V equipment manufacturer and all of our technicians recommend Panasonic plasmas. (Pioneer if you have the money, Panasonic if you're an average Joe like me)The picture is stunning and the number of connections is nice. I also bought a Toshiba A2 HDDVD player and WOW! Now I'm waiting for FiOS to deliver my new HD box. The SD signal from FiOS on this TV is fantastic, I can't wait to see HD!1 thing to note is that this TV DOES support HDCP. I haven't been able to find that in print anywhere, including the manual.Why I chose it:1. Price2. Quality - I saw this side by side with MANY other brands.3. Contrast ratio 10000:1The 1080p version of this TV was about $1000 more and only has a5000:1 contrast ratio."
5,Great Plasma TV for the money,"Great picture, good black levels. The built-in digital tuner is a nice feature -- since I don't use a cable box, I can get about 20 digital stations that come over the basic cable package I have. Only complaint so far is that there is no optical audio input available. Good value for the price."
3,Blinking red light of death,"Reserched flat screens for over a year, finally decided on the Panny TH42PX75U. The price was right. Now I know why. Everything was groovy until the other night when just settling into a movie there was a loud ""pop"" and all went dead. Then started the blinking red light. 10 times then pause. Lucky its under warrenty, so a repairman is coming. Seven days later! I went on line and googled Panasonic and blinking red light, low and behold im not the first and wont be the last. Buyer beware of this brand. You might get lucky, you might not. At least before you put down 1300 dollars google the blinking red light issue then make your own choice."
1,Fender Mini Deluxe Amp,"This is a very bad amplifier. Do not believe the good reviews you read about it. They are very misleading. The sound from it, even at low volume is horrible, unusable.The seller: Guitars and Gear is the most horrible seller that I have dealt with. I requested a return via Amazon.com link info but never heard one word from the seller. After notifying Amazon, they took care of it and allowed me to return the amplifier to the seller. I had to pay $10 for the shipping (for a $34.95 bad product!) Amazon was very prompt to give me a full refund, even before I had the chance to ship the amp to Guitars and Gear.I would recommend Amazon to drop this seller from their roster. During the entire ordeal, I never had a contact with Guitars and Gear. This appears to me like a one person business from a bad garage somewhere.I bought a 22W Squier SP-10 small amplifier and it is 1,000 times better than the Fender Mini Deluxe Amp I returned.Lan from Miami"
1,defective,It was defective and had to return it. Might have been okay if not defective. Got a larger amp instead.
2,Mini Deluxe Amp,"I was surprised at how MINI the amp really is! When it arrived, I was expecting a bigger amp. It does work with the battery (that comes with it). It does have adjustable volume and tone controls, but there is a buzzing sound with the bass notes that are played on my son's guitar. We bought it for our 11 year old for his birthday and it is okay for him to practice with, but that is all I recommend it for. At least it will be easy to carry and take with him on any trips."
2,Disappointing,"We purchased this mini amp for our 9year old for Christmas alng with the Fender Squire guitar. Was surprised at how small and seemingly cheaply made it was for a Fender product, but we thought we would give it a go. For such a small amp...(it is the saze of a small novel) it does get very loud. However, i thought the sound was pretty tinny. Our son carried it around most of Christmas day, playing his guitar. By mid-afternoon, the battery was dead, and the amp would not turn on at all with a new battery. We tried several batteries and it would never turn on...we sent it back and will definitely look for an amp of higher quality."
3,It's Cute!!!,You get what you pay for... something to play on around your home.Its a toy amp that makes little bass guitar noise. It serve my propose!
4,Fender Mini Deluxe Amp,"Small enough to travel in a carry on and ""amplifies"" your guitar when you turn it on. Reminds me of some table-top radios from decades ago and won't even remotely remind you of a real tube amp, but for the price, it serves its purpose. I was pleasantly surprised that it actually worked as advertised."
1,trash don't waste money,"sounds like crap, you have to turn all the settings (including volume) just to get rid of most of the horrible distortion"
4,Good choice,Our grand daughter got a bass guitar for Christmas and needed an amp for at home.This seemed to fit the bill.She said it works great.
5,Wonderful!,Perfect size for in house practice. Great sound and very compact. My sons has been getting a lot of use out of it.
4,Breathing your way to Enlightenment.,"This multi-disciplinary trek has a different feel than most of the similar tapes you will currently find on the market The initial breath-work sets a tempo for this work that is decidedly different from what I initially expected. Just when you become used to the up-tempo breathing, you move to a different level and tempo. The hypnosis, music and affirmations all seem to work together to eventually leave one with a different type of energy AND experience than can usually only be achieved by much study. Both Dr. Silvers and Dr. Gunther are to be commended."
5,Believe the hype on this book....,"Now THIS is what I'm talking about. Finally a novel worthy of its main character. You can tell that Peter David knows his stuff, and *GASP!!!* actually CARES about his characters instead of just writing about them. I was actually shocked by how much turmoil that the main characters (Bruce Bnner/Hulk, Betty Banner, Doc Samson)went through in this book, OUTSIDE of normal comic continuity. This is quite literally a ""page turner"" as the sotry is just, literally, all over the place. My only complaint is that the end conclusion feels abrupt and rushed. Maybe Mr. David was on a deadline, or maybe he just couldn't come up with a worthy enough conclusion to his fantastic story. Who knows, but it won't diminish the impact of what happened before. It's a shame that Mr. David didn't write another Hulk novel, as the Hulk novels are actually some of the better ones. Oh well, definately check this out!"
5,ONE GREAT BOOK,THIS BOOK WAS SO WELL WRITTEN TO THE COMIC THEY ARE TWINS. I FELT I WAS PULLED INTO A STORY OF A KNOWN HERO BUT OF AN UNKNOWN PAST.IT WAS GREAT COVER TO END
5,Powerful!,"A very powerful book.This short study is full of christian truth that will wake up the warrior within you.excellent for a christian who is looking for more strength in dealing with lifes many temptations.Writer Warren W. Wierbe executes a brilliant study on Eph.6, very motivational,a must for the stuggling christian in todays world!"
3,Unlikely to work on your current mac,This product will most likely not work on latest gen macs. The only sure way for this game to work is to buy it from the mac app store.
1,Did not Work,It might work for other people but every time I opened it...It just decided to crash on me. Soryy this is just my rating because it did not work for me.
1,THIS SUCKS!!!!!,TOO BAD THESE aspyr developers have not yet thought of doing their JOB so we IOS 10.8 Mac users dont waste neither money nor time on downloading useless software ; shoving the game up our A.... is all we have left now!!!! what's it going to take for you guys to finally develop the update for the Call of duty game series so they can be used on every Mac IOS?????
4,IMAC i7 works well with this game,"After Call of Duty 4 and Call of Duty 2, I was hooked and had to buy the first Call of Duty (deluxe)After I install the latest patch (not easy to find) it ran well on my IMAC i7. Before I did the latest patch it locked up a few times and became stuck. After the latest patch it locked up only twice and restarting game allowed me to play all events and ending.If you enjoyed COD4 and COD2 this game while much older still is fun and worth the playing time."
5,Fantastic Game,"Although the graphics may not be up to date, the intensity and fun of ""Call of Duty"" makes up for it all. The campaigns are fun, but the multiplayer is what does it the most. I highly recommend this game."
2,Call Of Duty Delux,Keeps freezing up. Not sure what to do with it. Not much fun when you can't complete the second part of the story/game line.
4,AEven beter than the demo,"I played the demo on a PC and decided that I had to have this for my Mac. I don't play a lot of games and I am a new Mac user as well. This plays great on my new MacBook Pro, 2.6 GHz, 4 Gb RAM, 512 video RAM, 200 Gb 7200 rpm drive, 17 -inch glossy screen Hi-Res. Smooth video and action. No problems what so ever. I'm very pleased."
3,Disappointed,"Was impossible to load missions on Call of Duty (original) after #1, and the United Offensive disc had several bugs in it. Fun to play when it worked, but the bugs greatly limited the experience."
3,Not suitable for macbook!,"It doesnt work properly on a macbook, i shouldve listened to the guy who posted an add saying basically the same stuff as me.Well pretty much its an overall good game, when you get to play it!!! i repeat when you get to play it, its pretty awsome.Most of the time if not all the time, it gets stuck and way too much lagging!I dont recommend getting this game for you macbook. since you cant change the video card for a macbook.Well if you want to be lagging all the time and not been able to enjoy this game, then this is the game for ya!!!Best of luck!!"
1,KEYS never work - lousy customer service at Aspry,"Activation key didn't work. Contacted Aspry and they basically blew me off. Thanks God for Amazon. THEY had to get another key from those clowns, and then THAT DIDNT work. What a bunch of morons at Aspry.Happily, of course, Amazon gave me a refund,"
4,What's to say - it's COD,Well done. Very playable and comprehensive. I've had good luck with the entire series and this one does not disappoint. It plays great on my 2008 MacBook Pro with OS X Snow Leopard....
1,Don't waste your money,"I could not get this game to function. I researched this game after purchasing it and it seems that many others have the same problem. Other games from the same publisher, like Call of Duty 2 and Call of Duty 4 work flawlessly.I am not a computer novice-I have more than 20 years experience in computers and run the entire network where I work.In short, don't waste your money."
2,If I can't play it.....,"I ordered the game but the product key wont work. I asked both Amazon and Aspyr for help. Amazon got me another key that still didn't work. After I told them that didn't work they told me to contact Aspyr. Aspyr just told me to 'consult Amazon for assistance.' Even after I told them Amazon sent me to them. Gee, what gives? Stay far away from the Mac Download on Amazon. Just get it on the Mac App Store."
4,Totally biased plug on my part,"Okay, until the end of January, (I know, only a few more days) you can subscribe to the totally hip literary zine, The Believer, and get a copy of The Polysyllabic Spree for free. The deal of the century! I devoured my free copy of TPS last night. Hornby's discussion of David Copperfield is not to be missed (there is still something new to be said about Dickens). Like many readers, I keep lists of books read and unread and love dishing here and elsewhere about their power, relevance, and lack thereof. I wish more of us (Amazonians) were as entertaining as Hornby. I'm assuming this column will continue in The Believer, so if you like TPS, you'll have to subscribe to The Believer anyway. What fun!"
2,Maybe my own fault,"Maybe my lack of enjoyment in this book was my own fault. I thought it would be a snappy narrative encouraging me to buy and read some excellent books, but I found it a bit dull. I don't live in England and had never heard of most of the books Hornby mentioned. Furthermore, I didn't find his random musings as fascinating as I'd expected. Perhaps if I'd read these articles one month at a time as published I would have found them easier to digest."
4,"great book, shorter than expected","hornby is always easy reading.charming, narrative like a friendly conversation.this book is shorter than i expected, but still a good read!"
4,It's fun being in Nick's head,"Sure, the book would have been better if I had read even 1% of the books that he was mentioning, but with that being said, it's a lot of fun just to hear Hornby's voice and follow his train of thought.What I really took away from this book is the fact that after Hornby reads a book, he forgets everything about it - which is a plight that I also struggle with; Thus these reviews to help me remember what I thought about a book that I read! If I was the type of person who gave high fives, I would totally give Nick Hornby a high five."
4,"as CDs of mixed jungle/drum&bass go, this is pretty good","I own DB's Shades of Technology and after listening to this one, I'm starting to catch his drift. There's a nice ratio of vocal tracks to abstract techstep. I'd recommend this for those with a taste for the sounds of techstep. Abstract's ""The Message"" is a killer!"
1,THE FANFARE WAS CUT SHORT!,"MY HUBBY FOR WHOM I ORDERED THIS WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE LENGTH OF 'FANFARE FOR THE COMMON MAN.' HE FELT RIPPED OFF BY THE SHORTENED VERSION. I BOUGHT HIM ANOTHER 'GREATEST HITS,' I ONLY HOPE THAT HE LIKES THIS ONE BETTER."
1,Very predictable story,"Was Bova even trying with this one? When he is good, he is excellent, but he wasn't good with this book. You can guess the ending soon after reading the beginning. I suppose the only unique thing about this story was having the hero fall in love with the wicked captain's cloned ""daughter"" of herself, but even that wore thin halfway through the story."
4,Not what I expected....,"This is my first Ben Bova book. I can see from the comments that I have a lot more of his books to read. I thought it was enjoyable and appreciated the science fiction aspect in that it wasn't hard to imagine the life the characters lead. I would have liked it to last longer so we could see if the ""frozen"" guy wakes up!"
4,Very comfortable shoes,"This is the first pair of Mezlan that I own (up to now my shoes are all either Cole Haan or Johnston&Murphy), and it is surprisingly comfortable. The color is a little bit off (it's a bit lighter than shown on the website) but overall I would rate it it a good buy."
2,Jane Asher custom book,"This book was ok. It is better in the hardback cover.The ""Fancy Dress"" is the title in the U.K. and it is in Hardcover,The ""costume book"" is the U.S . version and it in Paperback.The hardcover is better, it is sold in the U.K. only. but it has added things in it, that the paperback does not have.So if you are going to order it, Only get the hardcover, which is titled""Fancy Dress"".they are the same but the hardcover is better."
1,Horrible Tribute...,"The first Tribute to POM was somewhat tolerable, and I LOVE STRING QUARTED TRIBUTE TO NIRVANA'S NEVERMIND... excellent!! Pick that one up cause this blows horribly!!Like, seriously... this sucks. Steer clear."
3,"Fun game, nowhere near the original","Everything in this game they just kind of dumbed down. They kept the interaction with other people intact but in the original deus ex you had so many more people to talk to. Plus there is not as much of an emphasis in looking around under tables, insidofe alleys or anything like that to find extra really cool stuff. All the stuff you find you are told where it is and it is just boring. In the the first Deus Ex, I played it 10 times! I stll found somethign new the last time I played it. I will played the Invible War twice but then I am done with it.With all that being said it was still fun. The graphics are much better and it seems like the shooting is a lot better. A flawed game no doubt, but still very fun and one of the most non linear games you will ever play."
3,Needs a story line,While I loved the gameplay aspect of this the story line quite positively sucked! Of the 4 possible endings all are lame letdowns and very depressing. I got sick of the storyline half way through the game it was so lame. Someone with some creativity realy needs to get hold of this wonderful engine! I have played the game through only once which is very unusual for me (I replayed the end twice to check out a different ending but the other two are so obvious thier was no need to suffer through it two more times) I suppose if you can afford it this game is worth buying just for the diverse and unusual ways you can do things but if your looking for a fun story dont bother.
4,incredibly addictive,"this game is just fun. even though it takes you only about 12-15 hours to complete, it's well worth it. the fact that there is never an actual set way to do things in this games makes it even better. and i'm not just talking about standard objectives, but also everything else; you can choose to play as all stealthy like Solid Snake, or go all out like Master Chief, or do both. but in the end, your actions during the course of the game don't really matter, because you can still choose which faction you want to be a part of. that was my major complaint, that everything you have been doing for one faction is completely wiped out because you make a choice for another faction's good. Graphics are good, but not great. sound is also good but, again, not great. definatly worth atleast rental."
5,Bought for a penny,Can't go wrong with that price. First played this years ago. Game isn't as fast paced as human revolution but it plays similarly. Can be really difficult at times though.
2,No where near the original,Sorry to say this was a total let down! It does not even come close to the masterpiece of Dues EX... I had to have it because of the first EX just was not worthy of the title or name sake. Don't be fooled this is not what you think it will be!!!!!
4,Deus Ex: Invisible War,Excellent game that allows you to choose your own destiny. The game is filled with surprises and is definetly worth every penny.
4,Alex D.(Denton),you play as Alex Denton a clone of JC Denton and Paul Denton.You can be a girl or a boy.you can smoke drink beer or wine.And you can betray your friends I beat the game .I chose to work for JC.but I started a new game to work for someone else thrust me buy this game this is a really good game to play while waiting for halo2 .
1,Not 360 compatible,"I unfortunately could not play this, but my review is more of a warning to Xbox 360 users, this game is not compatible."
4,Good Times!!,"I had such a blast playing this game. The graphics are outstanding, even though it's a few years old. There's a lot you can do in the game with mods. You can choose to go the clean route, or go with black market mods that are outlawed. You decide who gets to rule the world and win in the end. Your allegiances can change at any given moment, and the whole world will be with you or after you! I've played it over twice now, and will probably do it again. Not a hard game if you're up for a challenge, but it's great fun!!"
2,IT'S......OK :),all im going to say is that they should of left deus ex alone.the first was the BEST DAMN GAVE EVER in my opinion notone can ouspeak me about that but this game lacks..ammo and biomods
2,"cumplido, pero no convincente.","Sylvester estubo extremadamente conservador en las notas agudas, y no se vio comodo en la interpretacion.Eva Marton en su papel de Turandot, no estubo al nivel que nos tiene acostumbrados en este roll.Creditos para Liu.Ecsenografia ok."
4,I found it!,"After visiting all of the gardening stores in my area, as well as Lowe's & HD, I couldn't find a reasonable sprinkling can with a removable nozzle. Wanted something light & plastic. Well here it is!...practical, reasonable, and efficient."
4,Big and EZ to Use,Had a swell plastic watering can that lasted me for years even tho I left it out in our Calif. winters. Hope this one does as good (since other reviewers said they really liked it.)
2,the unbalanced watering can.,the watering can is uneasy to handle to say the least. not balanced.i did not like --gave it away.---dont waste your time ordering---sorry.
4,"Ample size, not so great seal on spout.","Ample size, not so great seal on spout. The plastic threading left room for improvement. I played with it a little and was able to make it work. FAST shipping!"
1,Boring,"A boring, badly written rehash of previously published stories. Other authors have done it better."
4,"Royal pains, royal mess",Really enjoyed this book. I don't usually read books that don't deal with a true life murder/crime. I rarely worry about those in other countries let alone royal families but something about Monaco is really relatable and pretty interesting. Stephanie was just the eightie's Paris Hilton. What a charmed life those people were handed and they just couldn't handle it. The book is well written and has all the goodies. It reads like a juicy tabloid story. I liked it.
3,Royal House of Mnoco,"Book is okay but if you have a collection on the Monoco royal family as I do, including many articles & books on Princesses Caroline and Grace, this book is a very minor addition. The author gives credit in the back of the book for sources but it's hard to know, while reading, what is ""sourced"" and if it's an accurate source, or just the author's opinion mixed with some undocumented hearsay. It's worth an afternoon read but I wouldn't quote it--find the real source of information and make sure you get it accurate. I was hoping for a more in-depth analysis of the personalities."
4,New Information on the Grimaldi Family,"This is the first biography of the Grimaldi family to deal with the aftermath of Princess Grace's death. The author interviewed her son and heir to the throne, Prince Albert.There is the obligatory bit of gossip which the Princess or Palace cannot dislcaim, but once we get past that this book gives the reader an up to date persepective of life in Monaco at the end of the Millenniium."
1,"Moronic, mind-numbing trash","Save your money - at a fraction of the cost you can pick up any supermarket tabloid and get a more interesting, in-depth story of this pathetic family - and a far better written one at that."
4,Artists of the day!,"First, let me say that I believed the title to show that the book was about the Hanovers, or at the very least England during this time. It really isn't. This book is about artists during the Hanoverian times.Now, with that said, I think this is a very cute book, with lots of little tidbits. It is a beginners-ish guide to art and literature during this time period. I would recommend at least a little bit of knowledge, or at least be willing to look people up (as I did at times).As long as you understand this, you will find that it is a fun and quick read."
3,REG Project 4,"Not overly impressed. Makes for interesting background music, but doesn't stand out when listening to it like some of the Buddha Bar CD's."
2,"A/K/A ""Rest On Me""","This CD is a reissue of Kim's FIRST solo album entitled ""Rest On Me."" Highlights include her cover version of ""To Love Somebody"" (Bee Gees). ""I Won't Call You Back"", written by Kim is another good song. This is not a bad album, however the recording speed is horrible! It doesn't even sound like Kim singing. This CD is probably more a novelty item, as it was her solo debut--maybe it will be remastered at the correct speed which would drastically improve it! For some ""undiscovered classics"", I recommend MASTER SERIES. After hearing it, (like ALL her albums), wonder why she wasn't burning up the charts."
4,excelent,"I don^t speak english very well but , I try tell you about this CD This is one of the best Carnes^s Cd"
2,Drool leaks right through,"These bibs are very affordable, but they are not soft at all, and they barely last an hour before the drool leaks right through to the clothes. Definitely not worth it. They are our last choice for bibs - we only use them if ALL our other bibs are dirty."
2,Not good,"I purchased these bibs for my drooly teething baby because it said they were waterproof. Well, they aren't. The material feels cheap and very thin. Though the back has a plastic lining on, saliva just soaks through within a short period of time. The stretchy thin band that goes around baby's neck is too snug, and the velcro closure is cheaply made. These are rather inexpensive bibs, considering it comes with 10. I guess I should have known that you get what you pay for. We stopped using them after a couple of times, and I would not buy them again."
3,they are ok,"I think my baby is just too old for these now. He is 8 months old so he drooles through them fast. There is plastic on the backs, but he still drenches them fast.I do love how they velcrow on the side so his neck does not get scratched. The patterns are cute on some, not so cute on others."
2,Ehhhhh......,"These bibs are ok. They are really thin, so on extra drooly or spit-up days they don't hold up well. They will soak straight through to my son's clothes. The pack comes with 10 bibs, so I always have a fresh one to change him into. But I wish they would work better so I don't have to change them out multiple times a day.The price is reasonable, but you get what you pay for. I wouldn't buy these bibs again."
3,Not An Accurate Description,"This CD is NOT like the vinyl (album) ""At The Hop"". This CD has one disc with 12 songs. A few are the same songs and artists as the vinyl but only a few. The review on this page with all the songs listed from the 3 vinyl albums side A and side B for each is misleading. It belongs with the vinyl advertisement and the link from that page indicating ""At The Hop"" album is available on CD is totally incorrect and of course the description for the CD is very vague. I enjoy 50's music so the CD is OK but not receiving the music I was expecting was a great disappointment."
3,"Strong, but could've used more spark","Celebrated performing/composing/producing duo Ashford & Simpson crafted seven of this set's nine songs. While the tracks are polished and catchy, there is little here that makes an indelible impression. The up-tempo songs (""I Will Fight"" is best) are a bit too repetitive. On the ballads Knight's voice, always husky, sounds slightly exhausted. ""God Is"" is a charging, gospel duet between Gladys and brother Bubba. ""Changed"" is a sparely aranged ballad that shows Knight can always be more than the furious belter. Though this is recommended, fans should also seek out 1980's About Love lp -- also produced by A&S, it is more consistent and has more committed vocals from Gladys."
1,So much less,i just wanted to say that although this is a good movie but not worth the price...i got it for 75% less somewhere else and i wouldnt pay this much here for it. it is a power ranger classic though so if you are into the power rangers this is a mmust have.
2,Master of a Colony?,"I was born and raised in the Matanuska Valley Alaskan Colony that began in 1935. It was surely an experiment in the ""Socialization of the American farmer"". I am looking for ""who planned these colonies"" and did the write ups to get them included in FDR's plan. There were some 100 of them.Jim Vickaryous, Naples, Fl"
4,Gloriousy rich psychedelia,"The classic-rock band Mountain once titled a song ""Theme from an Imaginary Western,"" and that's a great description of this CD's contents. It's full of soaring yet tragic, wordless yet eloquent anthems to the promise and heartbreak of the American West. If you liked the Grateful Dead mostly -- or only -- for how their music refracted classic Americana, you'll like this.The instrumentation shows how far the Mermen have evolved from their surf roots. An acoustic guitar periodically sounds a fat cowboy keynote. Jim Thomas' 6-string electric slices and cries with a sad, Neil Young-style fuzz tone. 12-string electric and pedal steel guitars weave in and out of the mix, and an Indian sarod anchors ""White Trash Raga.""For Landlocked Surfer Dudes or Ladylike Sensitive Dancers seeking accompaniment for a Ludicrous Spring Dance, this drippingly psychedelic disc might be just the prescription."
3,"so bizarre, it's good....","A newspaper reporter is working on a story and pays a visit to a country sanitarium. After he has interviewed the staff and observed the happenings at the hospital, the reporter comes to a horrifying realization. The mental hospital is actually being run by the inmates and the leader is allowing them to live out their wildest and most bizarre fantasies."
3,"""Euro lunacy and mayhem abound!!!!""","Trapped in the back of every sane fool's mind are visions of insane asylums in the 18th century.Yea right! Well, anyway here it is in full view for everyone to see, and in dull but beautiful color. You know like all those weird dreams you used to have when you ate too much pizza the night before.This ones got a little bit of something for everyone - fist flying , damsels in distress , caged animals that resemble carny nuts, and a mad psychiatrist too ,throw in a midget or two and there you go ! Really fun stuff for the whole family."
4,Very strange fun!,"This film is quite odd but it is also a lot of fun and I'm glad I bought it! It's not a small film, either, with a large cast, wonderful costumes & camera work and parts of it were shot in large, old & seemingly abandoned buildings. It's not really an ""R"" kind of film at all but its perspective may confuse or seem unpleasant to some. Some of the dialogue is in English and some isn't but it's not the worst dub job around by any means."
4,"Meh, pretty good","I'm giving it four stars because of the good price and because it looks cool (you don't see a lot of jet black cues in most pool halls!). That it comes with a wrap is nice too, if you're prone to sweaty hands like me.But the graphite shaft feels ""odd"". The [...] pool guy claims graphite doesn't perform as well as real wood sticks, and I have to agree. Something about it just doesn't feel right. Also, the tip doesn't appear to have the correct rounded shape, although this may be intentional (so the player can shape the tip themselves?).If you simply want a cue that's straight and better than the unreliable house cues at your local pool hall, this is a good value for the money. But if you're serious about your game, you should pony up more cash and go with something better."
3,Average,"I like the cue, but it arives chiped (replace it and still got the same quality). As well the paint chipes away very easy."
1,Garbage,"I'm not a professional or anything, so I have low expectations for a ""good"" pool cue. I've previously purchased inexpensive ones at places like Wal-mart for $25 and been very happy with them.This cue was an absolute piece of garbage. First, it was somewhat nicked up already when I received it. When trying to remove the UPC sticker with my fingernail, more paint came off it. When I screwed the pieces together, they didn't even go together properly and were probably off by a good 1/4"". When I put it down on the table and rolled it, it was visibly bent already. After using it for one game, the bottom rubber stopper at the end of the stick just fell off. I mean, how many things can go wrong with a pool cue? There was no single good thing about this pool cue. Save your money. Go find the $25 Halex brand one that I bought from Wal-mart. That was is awesome. I wish I could find that on Amazon... I'd buy another..."
1,bad,"This cue may be usable for a short time by an absolute beginner. Once they start learning how to control the cue ball using anything besides a center ball hit, the cue quickly becomes useless. The action and feel of this cue is terrible."
1,do not buy,would have been a nice cue stick if it wasn't crooked as hell....i will just use this piece of crap to break....do not buy ....not worth it...there are better house cues than this crap.
4,Worth the price,"The shotgun shell holder does exactly what i expected it to do. It does move around a little (Just a little) when loading or unloading shells from it, but not enough to really matter."
2,Still trying to fit it on my Winchester 13000,"Bought it because it's universal fit. Not quite. I'm working on getting it on my shotgun, and am optimistic that one day I will. :-)"
2,"good book, photos missing","Great book, but I was disappointed that 85 photos listed in index were not included in my kindle edition. That fact should have been indicated in the description."
1,"GOT YOUR ATTENTION DIDN""T I...","Yepper, got your attention with that 1 star didn't I....first off, the concert deserves 10 stars. With that being said, all the above reviews that state this DVD was...""Incredible""....""Production, sound--fantastic"" and so on.....everyone of them is right, UNLESS you've seen the HD version....whoa!!! Blows this standard version out of the water (or 'forgiddaboudit' as the hub would say). I've got both, a copy of the version shown on HDnet, and this standard DVD (bought it for the 4 videos)....so yeah, 1 star for this DVD version as I can't stand to watch it after checking out the HD version...absolutely no comparisons..."
2,Great up until this year...,I have been using this program for years. This year is the last due to the Microsoft style registration. I had a crash and re-installed on a different computer and was denied activation by Intuit. I OWN IT!!! I will be trying something different next year.
1,Intuit just lost a customer...,"In all honesty, I have used TurboTax in the past, and it was an excellent product. However, I refuse to use a product with this type of activation scheme.Having to supply personal information to Intuit for the privelage of registering and using the software you purchased is bad enough.When you add on the horrifying prospect of wading through automated phone menus and talking to interns at some call center trying to get re-activated, ... there is simply no question about it."
1,"Don't buy, particularly if you use 98SE","Have been TurboTax customer and fan for 15 years. Usually get my return done in under 2 hours. This year could not get the program to ""activate."" Spent more than 10 hours on the phone with tech people (in name, at least) until got through to the office of the President of Intuit and was finally told that the ""activation"" scheme will not work with 98SE and my only recourse was to upgrade to later version of Windows. Despite the fact that TT is advertised, even today, as compatible with 98!I need to do a 4th quarter estimate for 2002 in 8 days and I don't know what I'm going to do. Turbo Tax is no longer the company we grew to admire -- and rely upon."
1,"Turbo Tax is suck, Tax Cut is awesome","For the past couple years I have been using Turbo Tax for filing return. However, due to the nature of spyeare that came with the Intuit product this year, I turned to Tax Cut to do my filing. And let me tel you this, Tax Cut is as good as Turbo Tax with less hassle as far as the installation concerns. Good bye Turbo Tax and hello Tax Cut from now on."
1,Saved by Norton Antivirus and Amazon,Norton Antivirus let me know that turbotax wanted to do bad things... Amazon reviews and technical sites told me what ituit wanted to do. TaxCut and Money 2003 for me -- Rebates in 10 calendar days. BTW: The hard drive on my old PC with many years of tax data finally died today. I have my TaxCut backed up to another PC and just did a test printing of my almost finished return. Where would have TTax left me....?
1,double charges,"I used to like this program, then last year it failed to connect when efiling. I pasted it off and mailed my returns. Only then to fight and never receive my efiling refund.Since it is simple tried again this year ... My return was rejected and had to fix a minor error. Their system charged me again, even though it is very clear that any rejected return is refiled at no cost. Now it appears they are going to try and make me jump through hoops to get this refund.After last years problem, I know they have stolen my money. Guess I'm off to call the cridit card company to refuse the charge. Then at least it's in their court to show why I was charged twice."
1,Never Again,"After a long and satisfying run with Intuit software products, I fear it is time to part. Turbo Tax software did terrible things to my system, including the installation of a resource hogging program called C-Dilla. After several unsuccessful attempts to get the software installed, update and running, I finally gave up and attempted to uninstall it. Much to my surprise, my CD-RW suddenly quit working, and after hours of research, phone calls, assistance from friends, etc, the root cause was found to be the C-Dilla services which were installed without my knowlege, and running in the background. Fortunately, Windows XP system rollback removed the offending software without a trace, except for some hidden sectors on my hard drive which are not accessed if the C-Dilla software is not installed. Sorry Intuit, but I have better things to do than deal with problems caused by a formerly excellent product gone bad."
1,Very disappointing,"After using turbotax for the past 5 year and enjoying it, I will never buy Intuit products again. Just the advertising they load onto the desktop is reason enough, but add in the ""Activation"" and ""C-Dilla"" junk and they are through with me."
1,Boo Hiss!,What a let down from the old Turbo Tax! Intuit has really stepped in it with this release. I'm moving on to another tax program for 2003 tax purpurses!
2,All the reviews scared me.,"I have been using TurboTax for the past few years. And this year I was about to buy the new 2002 version, but after reading all the negative reviews about the spyware and other problems, it made me feel uneasy buying TurboTax this year. I'm glad I didn't buy the software yet. It probably saving alot of headache. I will check out other tax softwares instead. Thanks for all the reviews."
1,Time to Dump TurboTax,"After being a loyal TurboTax user for years, I am disappointed at this year's product and would not have purchased the 2002 version had I known earlier about not only the Safecast feature, but also its ever-increasing advertisements for products included only at additional cost. If they thought some of these add-on products were so invaluable, why didn't they just include them as part of the package...or ask at the very end of the interview session, ""Is there any other .... we can sell you?"""
2,Intuit Cripples Turbo Tax,Consider your purchase of TT carefully! For 2003 it is crippled with C-dilla Safedisk copy protection... It must be registered by phone or internet and you can only install a full featured TT... on a single computer [at a time.] Furthermore C-dilla ... can not be easily removed from your system and remains after TT is removed. This year TT is also full of accidently tripped upgrade offers that are at least infuritating and possibly expensive....
1,Warning....,"I've been a Turbo Tax (and Quicken) customer for the past 6 years...religously upgrading each year. I'd heard about the activation and [C-Dilla] installs with this version of Quicken, but decided to give it a shot anyway because I was a loyal customer. Big Mistake!Turbo Tax will not activate on my machine at all. I've been through 3 chat sessions and two phone calls, and the [people] at Intuit can't get it to work. I've uninstalled and re-installed 11 different times. No luck. So now I'm out [the money I paid] and about 4 hours of my time! It would have been easier to do my taxes by hand!Someone should tell the business wizards at Intuit that their most precious asset is not the ""intellectual property"" they seem so proud of...but their base of loyal customers! Looks like they forgot that software is supposed to make your life easier...not more complicated.As for me...I'm done with Intuit for good. I just ordered MS Money and TaxCut. I encourage you to do the same."
1,Caused my computer to have problems,"Intuit's TurboTax Deluxe installed unwanted software on my computer, causing a lot of issues. It installed IE 5.5, then I could not surf at all until I installed Netscape, then later did a total reinstall of Windows 98SE. Intuit's software also installs DRM Macrovision Safecast and C-dilla. After Turbotax installation, my computer's sound has been locking up. The authentication will present some problems if you change major hardware components or you decide to get a new computer. Intuit's support team was not much help. I've decide to switch to TaxCut which can import last year's TurboTax files and TaxCut is a much better value anyway.Update: I used Turbotax Deluxe 2006 and TaxCut 2006. Intuit has made improvements since the 2002 version and it runs without a glitch on my WinXP machine. I rate TurboTax 2006 4 stars out of 5. If you buy two (different) tax programs you can always pick the one giving the best return. Shop around for better prices."
1,Piece of [Junk],"Not only does it contain [C-dilla], but if you get one of those CD's they sent out, install it, and then decide to purchase the software in the store, it will not work!The resources it uses constantly makes your computer run like a herd of turtles.For the trouble it has caused me, they should give me a refund plus labor for the 3 hours it took to reformat my hard drive and install all of my programs over.I have since purchased Taxcut and it blows Turbotax away. Now there's how a tax software should work! Turbotax, you lost another customer. Never again!!!"
3,Could not activate. No more Turbotax for me!!,I bought Turbo Tax 2000 deluxe and attempted to install it on my PC. I could not get it to activate. I tried to call tech support and they told me the serial was pirated. I asked them what they doing selling pirated software to me and other faithful Turbo tax customers. I was not about to mess around. I needed to get me return done so I got a refund and bought TAXCUT. Does the same thing and does not mess with your PC with SPYWARE!!!.
1,Turbo Tax - What a Disappointment,"I have used Turbo Tax Deluxe for the past 4-years with no problems. After receiving a Turbo Tax CD direct from Intuit, I installed it on my lap-top computer, paid for it on-line, then installed it on my desk top computer as I did for the last 4 years. But while installing it on my desk top computer I was directed to contact Intuit by phone for order confirmation because I needed a new product key. I tried calling Intuit for 8 days with no luck, finally when I reached a customer support rep, I was told that to install Turbo Tax on another computer I would have to purchase an additional license (...). Turbo Tax be assured that I will never use your software again."
1,It's gotta go,"Unfortunately, I installed this product before looking at any reviews (have been using it for years, faithfully purchasing it ever year).The C-Dilla [program] appears to have interfered with my CD-RW ability... in any event, its off to an alternate product for me. Hope to return it, we shall see how that goes."
1,Activation scheme can hurt other software and functions,"I am switching to Block's TaxCut after using TurboTax for nearly ten years.Their new secret protection scheme can be a disaster for your other software and computer. According to Macrovision's own product description, their protection software thwarts use of CD recording devices. There are reports of CD recorders being disabled from working on anything, protected or not.It is also very difficult to get the Macrovision SafeCast product off of your computer. It does not uninstall when TurboTax is uninstalled."
1,Customer Service,After first installing this program I installed a new hard drive. It took at least two toll calls and three plus hours to re-activate the program so that I could use it with out purchasing a new license. No more Intuit products for me.Davidr
1,BEWARE - C_DILLA ... / COPY PROTECTION,"I have used TurboTax for eight years, but this year they have used a highly intrusive, insidious ...registration/copy protection [program] called C_dilla. They don't tell you they're going to install it.... It loads every time at Windows startup whether TurboTax is used or not. After three hours trying to uninstall TurboTax and C_dilla, I finally had to use the Windows system restore feature to roll back by computer to a prior restore point. I am now going to return this product. I won't let it on my computer...."
1,Won't run under Win4Lin. Can't file amended returns.,"I bought every year's TurboTax without looking at reviews or features, based on many years of good will from excellent software. Never again. Many reviewers mentioned the problem with product activation that prevents you from filing amended returns if you or the IRS decides you need to. That alone makes TurboTax completely unsuitable for use. A second problem I haven't seen mentioned is that it will not run under Win4Lin (runs Windows applications under Linux) and I don't want to reboot to Windows-only just to run the tax software. But thank goodness I installed TurboTax only under the Win4Lin virtual Windows which I can rebuild fairly easily. If I had installed it on my native PC and C-Dilla had modified my Master Boot Record, who knows if I would ever be able to repair my computer? *DANGER* stay away from this program!"
1,C-dilla???? Get off my machine,"I love TurboTax, but hate this new activation. I shouldn't have to search the net for information about an unauthorized piece of software running in the background. When I saw something called c-dilla, I immediately thought it was a virus, but found out that TurboTax is what installed it. Shame on them."
1,DON'T INSTALL this software if you multiboot,"If you use a boot loader different from what Windows installs into boot sector (i.e. the Bootmagic from Partition Magic, the System Commander, GRUB, or any other multiboot loader), TaxCut copy protection softare will render your PC UNBOOTABLE."
3,activation gone in 2003!!??,Check out the Turbotax support web site. They say product activation is removed for 2003 based on Customer feedback. Soundslike they heard us. Time will tell.
2,HR Block is Better,"I used Turbo Tax for a long, long time. Every year there would be some awful problem, some point where the instructions were unclear, or I had to go to the post office and get a form they didn't have, or a worksheet I would have to do by hand. It was easier than doing it by hand, but it was not easy or intuitive. Last year I got a deal on HR Block, and gave it a try. It was soooo much easier. Plus, they did not try to hijack my machine with snitchware. If I was Intuit reading these reviews, I would be scared."
4,Copy Protection will backfire,"I have the solution for those of you who want to put the program on your laptop and/or re-install 3 years from now in case of an IRS audit. There is a guaranty on the box that says use this program for sixty days and if you are not satisfied, return it for a full refund. I did return Turbo Tax and got a full refund. I am buying Tax Cut with the refund.Use the guaranty - that's what it is for. If you are unhappy for any reason return Turbo Tax and get a REFUND and buy a product that does satisfy you."
3,I guess it is better than hand writing your tax return...,"As long as you are going to only install the software once on one machine and only print from that machine. I wonder what happens if your pc crashes and you need to rebuild it, I guess you have to go buy a new copy.Rebate after rebate.. they let you go online and fill out a rebate form but you still have to mail the damn thing in with the original form ?? what is that??? What is the point??"
3,It is cheaper at Costco,I have used turbo tax software from 1995. This year with the copy protection methods will cause some hardships to certain people. But I must commend Intuit in taking a bold step towards piracy. ...
4,No Problems,"I have used both of the major tax prep programs out there, and cant say that I find one that much better than the other. I like the way Turbo Tax presents the information. Thats why I use it. As far as installation goes, I had no problems. My computer works the same now as it did before. I am running this on a older P3-450 and havent had my computer slow down at all. I would definately reccomend this product. There are still some issues that frustrate me with updates, but overall the product was definately worth the money."
4,"Before switching, go to Intuit.com Technical Support FAQ's!","I read many of the reviews concerning the new Turbo Tax product activiation, and I almost decided to switch to another product (I am a loyal TTax user too) until I did my own research. I went to Intuit.com Technical Support FAQ's and read everything about product activiation. It tells you that you can easily reinstall the product on a new computer, there are no privacy or spyware issues, etc. They are just trying to control the misuse of the license agreements, which is understandable. If you sold software would you want everyone passing your software around or would you want each person to purchase their own copy?"
5,Turbo tax is so much better than taxcrud,"I used taxcrud for a few years, and switched to turbo tax. It was so much easier to use, especially for my small home biz. Easy to activate, but im not sure the activation program was the best choice. From all the feedback i've read, I bet they change it for next year. I bet that most of the complainers out there just can't stand the fact that they can't share it now with their friends and ""family."" Hah!Well, too bad, I say. By the way, Taxcrud=HR block=microsoft. So if you're that unhappy with the software, buy micorsoft, or do it by hand with your trusty calculator."
1,Activate this.,"The ill conceived product activation feature has turned me away from using Turbotax in the future. I have been using it for as long as I can remember. While I don't mind registering a product, when I have to talk to Intuit's sales representatives because I have bought a new computer, that is beyond reason. Have you tried contacting Intuit's sales representatives? Need I say more?Don't even think about buying this abomination."
1,To much hassle.,I have used Turbo tax for the last six years and didn't expect anything to be too different. Switching to a new computer during the tax process was complicated by the new product activation. Why should I have to spend time downloading more software to remove the [program] Turbo has buried in my software. It looks like the switch to TAXCUT will be easy since they can import last years Turbo file. Now I need to figure out how to get my money back from Turbo.
1,-5 minus 5,"I hope I will get money back in Costco. Will never use it again.I did not activate it and just hope they will go out of business.Will not ever use it again, not even for free.rk"
1,...,As a previously satified user I was shocked when I found that TurboTax Deluxe 2002 had installed C-Dilla.... I became outraged when I found the the uninstall of TT does not remove C-Dilla and leaves it running on my machine consuming my resources.... I will recommend another product.
1,Shame there are no 0 stars entry,Given the mess Quicken has made of their entire software line with this difficult and broken registration. I have sworn off all Quicken products after this nightmare.
1,Don't waste your money!,"First: Many taxpayers can do e-filing for free: Check the IRS site.Second: After TurboTax reviewed the file, it sent it to IRS. IRS rejected it. TurboTax promised an explanatory e-mail, which never arrived.Third: I bought first the premier version: It did not allow downloading of specific accounts from Fidelity that I needed: It downloaded everything that was under my SSS #. To download specific accounts, I had to buy again TurboTax, this time through Fidelity. The downloading of specific accounts worked OK, but it was essentially impossible to edit the entries. Every new entry appeared together with the supposedly edited entry.Fourth: No point in attempting to get service form the company: Tremendously long delays or they charged.Finally, I had to enter the data by hand and file a hand-written return, because the free software listed in the IRS site would not download the data I needed.TurboTax is an aberration that should be out of the market."
1,Ban Idea Intuit - Customer for many years feels violated,"Well, what can I say. I am not the only one - After reading the business section of the Chicago Tribune on Monday the 10th of 2003.WHy, Why Why - Not only does [C-dilla] provide a source of shame for Intuit - IT is like I was in a good relationship with TurboTax then it cheated on me.1. I spend good money on a dinner (Turbo Tax Deluxe) year after year and not it cheats on me.2. I get no support - I need to beg. Web suport is a joke ""hello you are 834 on the list please wait and I will be with you shortly, like an hour later and the system cuts off?3. Why can I not do taxes at work and home? don't you trust me?4. YOur update messed up your own application running on Xp? Now I need to call you for reactivation.Bye Bye Intuit"
1,Do some research before you buy!,"There have been many claims that C-dilla is not spyware. This isn't strictlyWhat seems to be true is that vendors (like Intuit) can disable the spyware features and use it as just licensing software. Did they? I don't know. All I know is that it seemed to screw up other software, I had a bear of a time getting rid of it, (even with the instructions (more like destructions)), and I ended up reformatting my harddrive and reinstalling everything else.With all the time I wasted to get my computer back to normal, I probably would have been better off writing my tax form long hand.Is it spyware? It seems closer to a virus.Would I recomend software with licensing controlled by c-dilla?Not if there is any possible way to avoid it."
2,Disappointed this year,"I have been a fan of Turbotax for many years. However, this year they have made the whole package un-user friendly from the (1) awkwardness of purchasing and having to apply for rebates to get the state version to (2) pricing extra features to (3) software protection handicaps to (4)navigation difficulties - all this in addition to (5) pricing the version offered long-time subscribers higher than for store purchase, and finally (6) not notifying of availability then shipping it unordered (I was told some files had been deleted in error!) -- I will probably try a new product in the future.........."
1,Return Turbotax 2002,Intuit has lost my business. As soon as my product is received from Amazon it will go right back. It is a shame a good product has to be have hastles tied to it. I use two computers and the limit on using it on one is not going to work.
1,Questionable reviewers,"There have been some questions raised in these reviews about the possibility of Intuit employees posting favorable reviews. I generally take these accusations as sour grapes, but...About 45 reviews earlier than this one is a review posted by Walter from Pittsburg, PA.I doubt Walter is really from Pittsburgh, PA. If he were, he would not have misspelled Pittsburgh.By the way, Pittsburg, CA, in the San Francisco Bay Area does not have an ""H"" at the end. Mountain View, CA, also in the SF Bay Area, is where Intuit is headquartered."
3,Turbo Tax's Printing Remedy,"Although Intuit is requiring activation for their products being copied onto multiple computers, and as mentioned by others before me that this was to be expected eventually with piracy and all, at least they have provided a remedy in the .pdf file creation that can be copied to a floppy disk and printed from another computer or just emailed home, or what not. Why not make sure that everything is correct before creating the PDF file, you shouldn't need to create it anyway until you're really ready to submit. As far as the C-dilla directory and the process that is kicked off from the boot sector goes, nobody likes to see things like this ... probably its software that enforces their license in some way. It would be nice if someone could de-compile their binaries and take a peak to make sure nothing is going on that shouldn't though."
5,Ignore most of these reviews,"Bottom line, this product works and works very well. You will easily save the cost of the software on your taxes....TurboTax is a good product for you."
1,Absolute Nightware !,"What was once a great product is now garbage.A company entrusted with such important business (our taxes)can not operate with no customer support !Heed my advice do not use this product.Do your taxes ""by hand"" You will be glad !Greed has driven this company to it's demise."
1,Don't Buy It,"I was shocked when I installed this year's Turbo Tax. You are not allowed to install and use this program on two computers. I have a laptop and a desktop. Normally, I install on both computers and work on my taxes whenever I have time either at home or at the office. With this year's change, you can only print and transmit your returns on the first computer where you installed. What a major inconvenience!Intuit sure didn't have the end user in mind when they made this change. This type of attitude happens when a company grows too big and they feel that whatever they do, the consumer will accept.I am mad at myself for not checking the customer comments section first before I clicked on the purchase button. Unless Intuit removes this unacceptable feature next year, I will buy TaxCut. Thanks God that Turbo Tax is not the only tax software in town"
1,Another TTax user leaving,"TurboTax could count on my [money] every year since 1991. Next year I'll be looking for another package. Send a message to software sellers that load an application with unwanted adds, (on your desktop with after installation icons, and during the tax interview in the middle of the application) and ""copy protection"" that installs a spy program that always runs. No thank you. There will be a great opportunity for TurboTax competitors next year to advertise a feature that will populate their 2003 program with TurboTax 2002 data. I'll buy it, providing it doesn't also have similar ""copy protection."""
1,Tax software sinks to a new low,Intuit has failed to make the necessary repairs in its Turbo Tax software for the 2003 tax year. This years version will not load into many computers due to major glitches. Tech support is even worse than previous years. There is no way to access tech support by phone and the online vesion is only available 9-5 on weekdays. They obviously don't want to deal with their software problems. Turbo Tax had a good reputation which has been ruined by Intuit and their lack of support. Sorry all you loyal users but it is time to drop out of this failing products support base. Intuit refuses to deal with its continuing string of problems and is only milking the product until it will collapse.
1,Turbo Tax - don't spy us!!!,"I installed Turbo Tax 2002 and only after a long time I realizedthey also installed a spyware. A shame! Besides that, they createdthis very weird directory in my machine c_dilla, the activation wasfull of restrictions, I uninstalled it (for obvious reasons) and when I need to print my tax return again I could not, I received a message from the installer saying: ""This Intuit product is no longeravailable. Please call 1-800 333-2917"" (a useless number).I won't use it again!!!"
1,They gave themselves 5 stars??,"After all the problems and crap that Intuit took for the activation/spyware issue, now they place the newspaper apology on Amazon and give themselves 5 stars?? I'm completely disgusted, and will not use any Inuit product for at least several years while I observe their new track record."
1,Product activation = unusable product,"I have been a TurboTax user for the last 5 years, but I think this year I will have to switch. Like a lot of others who have commented on this product, I was not able to activate my TurboTax even though it was the first time I installed it. Their ""live"" help told me to reinstall from hard disk, to reinstall in safe mode, and then to clean up the disk. After spending 3 hours with them, I gave up. I am a computer developer so I am comfortable working with computers, but this product is impossible to work with!"
1,Who's Stuffing the ballot box?,"I saw a whole slew of positive responses regarding this product at the end of January. They all look suspiciously similar. Anyone who rates this product better than 1 star either :1) Doesn't understand the C-Dilla and privacy issues.2) Works for Intuit.I have owned Intuit products for both Mac and Windows machines for many years. One of the first things I do around Christmas is look for the new release of Quicken and Turbotax. This year I am stunned by the audacity and ill considered actions of Intuit with regard to their copy protection scheme. C-Dilla not only is installed on your machine, but stays there after a ""normal uninstall"".I have personally had the reported problems with my CD Burner subsequent to installing Turbotax/C-Dilla. At this point I am still trying to find a work-around for it...."
1,If I could give it 0 stars I would,"I did not have any problems ""activating"" this ""product"". But what I can't do is update it (one-click update or manual) or even register it. It seems it has major problems with doing anything on the internet. Tech support indicated this was a known problem with the manual update downloads that they offer and the only solution was to get Customer service to send an update on CD. I suggest Intuit invest in H&R Block because they are sending a lot of customers over to TaxCut. I will be returning my copy of TurboTax. It shouldn't take longer to install tax software then it does to complete ones return. Intuit may soon be more hated then the IRS."
1,turbo tax management stupid idea.,"I have been using your software for more than four years without any problem for the first two years, but last year and this year I start having major problem with this product. The problem I'm having that the software continues to reboot my system once I start printing. This new software C-Dilla that is always running on your computer in the background and constantly sending out data about you to their servers (aka spyware).I WILL NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN."
2,Has to be connected to the internet..... the slow way,"My taxes seem to have come out okay.... My problem borders on the ""how dumb can this program be"" side of things. The program requires an internet connection to register the software and it insists that an update is also highly recommended (fine, whatever).Then the software can't recognize my highspeed connection! I had to disconnect from my fast connection and install a modem so I could connect on a dial-up. Then spend an hour on a slow dial-up and not be able to use my phone. How stupid can a program be to not be able to recognize an always on internet connection in the year 2003.After reading the other reviews I suspect it is just one more problem with the design."
2,Didn't dare reinstall on failure,"When trying to update Turbotax somehow one of the download files got corrupted and it got stuck in this endless nasty loop, where it couldn't patch and couldn't update. Every time I started I had to go through this routine. NORMALLY since I had just installed the software I'd do a clean install and be happily on my way. However, with the new copy protection scheme they are using (and IMPOSSIBLE hold times) I was too nervous to try it, because it sounded like you'd quickly be forced into purchasing 2,3,4 or even five copies if you had to reinstall.Also, whenever something doesn't work on my system I am always worried now that the copy protection is causing it. I can't wait till I can STRIP Turbotax off my computer and be back to a clean and safe system. Next year I'll be getting taxcut, and hopefully it won't be so invasive."
1,Activation nightmare,"I installed turbotax and it went fine. Then I bought a new hard drive and reinstalled all my software. The activation that turbotax now requires bombed. Technical support was absolutely no help. And there are parts of this program that hide on your hardrive even after the uninstall....terrible product. After 10 years of buying turbotax, i will never purchase it again. I am switching to taxcut."
1,Forget it......,"I spent 3 hours trying to activate the software, customer service was useless, tech support is a toll call (I gave up after 30 minutes on hold),and their final recommendation was to get a refund and try their online service. After being a Turbo Tax user for years, my recommendation now is to try the competition. Intuit has decapitated a great product."
1,"BUY ""TAX CUT"" INSTEAD","I had used this product (Turbo Tax) for years, but now with activation, I can't read old returns on my new PC.This new 'activation' assumes I am ""Guilty Until Proven Innocent"".DON'T BUY TURBO TAX !..."
1,Who's lying?,"Just compare the positive and negative reviews, it's not hard to see the pattern: all the positive ones are short, lacking details, appearing close to each other, with simple user names, and directed towards critisism. On the contrary, all the negative ones are relatively long and detail-oriented. So it doesn't take too much to figure out who's trying to mislead here..."
1,Find an alternative to TurboCrap,"This is an all time low for this product, find a better alternative - I think I may actually just go find an accountant instead. It's much less invasive and it's really not worth the savings in time if I have to spend days messing with de-installation, my time is much more important.Shame on you, Intuit - I'd like to give you a negative rating if I could."
1,Man this activation sucks!,"I used this product faithfully for years, but no more. I bought my product, activated it. After I uploaded updates the activation was nullified. Now I have to call an undermanned call center that is only open from 9-5 PST, M-F. If you're lucky to get through, get ready to be put on hold for a long time. Hello Intuit, most people work from 9-5."
1,No respect for customers,"I have used TurboTax for at least 5 years, but will NEVER buy it again. First, I very much resent ... C-Dilla being installed and I will uninstall this program as soon as my taxes are finished. Second, there is no way to 'customize' the installation. I did not want Internet Explorer 5.5 installed, and there is no way to avoid it. I even tried to follow Intuit's instructions for a hard drive install, and that didn't work. Third, Intuit's online 'chat' support is terrible - rote replies and no real knowledge."
1,Wow Spyware and one PC locking!,"So you really want to do your *taxes* with a program that is full of spyware like Gator and Brilliant Digital? How safe is that?Also forbid that you ever get a new PC! You'll have to buy the software all over again according to tech *and* management support from Intuit! Check out this excerpt from a Cnet article:But TurboTax user Joel Bradford, an educator from Eugene, Ore., said it wasn't that easy for him when he switched PCs last month. After removing TurboTax from his old PC, he was unable to reinstall it on the new one, and Intuit customer support offered no help.""I tried contacting Intuit through the online tech support,"" he said in an e-mail interview. ""The...representative was nice enough, but he offered no other solution than for me to buy a new license. I had the same experience with the senior support person (telling me) that I need to buy another license.""Thumbs down to Intuit"
1,I've made the Switch,"I've been a user of both Turbo Tax and Quicken since the DOS versions. But after reading reviews of Turbo Tax for 2002, and reviews on Quicken 2003, I am switching from both. I have just purchased TaxCut for my 2002 taxes, and will probably move to MS Money in 2004. I understand that Quicken 2003 also has the same registration issues, and since I upgrade my hardware on my PC at least once every 6 months, there is no way I am going to purchase a product that will not reinstall if I change out my hard drive to a faster/larger hard drive, or upgrade the processor chip on my mother board.Intuit, if you are monitoring this board, you have lost another long term customer."
1,Do NOT Buy this!,"I end up buying 2nd license to file my return. And the only reason I purcase the 2nd copy is that I already spent 2 weeks working on my return (lic 1), before I last my drive. I was lucky I made a backup of my return, but in order to complete my return Intuit (reinstall on the new drive)forced to buy 2nd license. What will happen if you want to ammend you return years from now...buy another copy??..No way. I never used TaxCut,but my next purchase will be that and not turbotax."
1,Not worth the hassle,"I am thoroughly frustrated with the product activiation and poor customer service. Installation issues are rendering me unable to use the product I legitimately bought.I strongly suggest that prospective customers steer cleer of this product and Intuit. Historically, I have been a loyal Turbotax user. However, I now feel compelled to find another vendor and solution."
1,Slippery Slope,"I don't care if Intuit wants me to activate their software. It's a hassle but, in the end, it's a nit.Nor do I care about being stopped every 5 minutes during TurboTax's interview process so Intuit can try to sell me just one more tiny add-on/product/service,... It's annoying but, in the end, it's the American way.What I DO care about is this SafeCast / C-Dilla garbage. Not only does it install without notice, it installs surreptitiously by instlling into a hidden folder. Then, it runs as a system process which is automatically launched at start up independently of TurboTax. And it's not uninstalled when TurboTax is uninstalled.The process uses ""only"" 1 MB of RAM. That's not much, of course, until EVERY software vendor in the world decides to follow suit by using ""their own"" 1 MB of MY RAM.I've removed all Intuit software from my computer."
1,Bought TaxCut instead - doesn't require activation,"I was a loyal Turbo Tax customer until I found out this year that they have implemented an annoying product-activation system, which doesn't allow you to easily install the product on more than one pc at home. I have a laptop AND a 2 desktop pcs at home, so the product activation headaches make it not worth the purchase.I purchased TaxCut instead and it is terrific, does the job, doesn't have the annoying problematic product-activation, and I will be a loyal customer to them from now on. I suggest that you purchase TaxCut instead of Turbo Tax."
1,Garbage,"...I have been a loyal user from the start of your company. I probably still have the orginal Turbo Tax, Quicken, and Quickbooks on 5.25 floppies. Your software has always been just okay, buggy, but still the best out there. Unfortunately your company just doesn't get it. You think for every pirated copy you have lost a sale. Wrong, these people would not have bought it anyway. You cause rightful owners just too much trouble. All your software is getting just too much of a commercial for other products, nag, nag, nag. There is plently of other options out there now. Anyone with a simple return can go to the IRS or their state's website and do it for nothing or buy Taxcut for more complex returns. It reads your past years data from TTax just fine. Read the article about Intuit on Yahoo. This mess has actually caused their stock to drop... I'm going find other alternatives to your other products"
1,Switching to TaxCut next year,"My gripe relates exclusively to the activation scheme, which includes surreptitious installation of a rogue program called C-Dilla on your hard drive.I've been using TT for roughly ten years. The program itself is great, but I'm strongly opposed to the aggravation of the various activation processes used by Intuit, Microsoft and others. I concur with the need for software developers to protect themselves against piracy, but it shouldn't be done at the expense of honest consumers. So, next year I switch to TaxCut."
1,Time to Switch to TaxCut,I've used Turbotax for around 6 years. I had to file 1040Xs twice during this time. I've also upgraded my computer twice during this 6 years. It was very convenient for me to be able to load up previous-years Turbotax software to do the recalculation for the 1040Xs. Activation requirements would turn this exercise into a never-ending nightmare. I think I'll pass.I've switched to TaxCut this year.
1,installs spyware without notification,"This is the last time I purchase Turbotax. It installs a spyware that starts everytime you start your machine. The turbotax uninstaller doesn't remove the spyware. If you want to run your purchased, registered version of Turbotax on another one of your computers you are out of luck.Intuit is on my .... list"
1,Tax Software Too Important to Risk Activation Hassles,"I hated to switch tax software, but after reading these activation horror stories I just couldn't buy TurboTax again this year.Can't reinstall if I get a new computer? Installing spyware-like monitoring software that can't be uninstalled? Sorry, but NO DICE.I switched to Tax Cut and was pleasantly surprised. It worked just as well and was cheaper. I'll be using Tax Cut again next year."
1,Disappointed after 7 years of good service,"I am returning my TT Deluxe for a refund. I attempted to do a quick check before filing my estimated due Jan 15. I have normally done this at the office and then done the complete filing at home. Not only could I not install at home after installing at the office, but I found when I uninstalled at the office and attempted to install at home that would not work either. I then found that Intuit has installed C-dilla, a copy protection piece of software. I called Intuit and asked for an activation code to use at home. They refused (3 live agents and 1 phone agent). Intuit is entitled to copy protection but if I uninstall on one system I am entitled to be able to use it on another. They have lazy programmers who can't figure out how to do this or they have intentionally figured they could get you to pay for their product more than once."
1,Don't buy it,"Turbo Tax Deluxe is a great disappointment this year. I work on my taxes while vacationing in Florida. I've always installed to both my desktop and my laptop.Not this year.Turbo Tax allows only one installation, and a ""trial version"" on a second computer. OK. That was awkward but do-able.But wait a minute! I downloaded the state tax and found it cannot be used with the trial version.After more than five years as a Turbo Tax customer, I've found the rules have changed and the product is of no use to me. They offer my money back, but that doesn't pay back the years I've invested in their product."
1,Product activation debacle - no product key included!,"I tried to install TT only to find there was no product key printed on the CD sleeve! While not as bad as the previous poster who mentioned getting a Mexican music CD, this is still pretty pathetic. Even worse, this is mentioned as a problem on Intuit's support site so apparently it's not an isolated incident. I guess they need to fire someone in QA in addition to firing the genius that came up with this product activation idea. TurboTax 2002 will soon be synonymous with ""New Coke"".I've used both Quicken and TT for 5 years now, but Intuit can kiss my business goodbye. I've got better things to do with my time than beg Intuit for a code to activate software I legally purchased - like exchange this copy of TT for TaxCut."
1,activation? please.,"software which requires activation and which can only be fully used on one computer is a rental. when i buy something...it's mine. intuit should learn a thing or two about fair use. their ignorance on the topic just cost them a 5 year customer.i even have lingering questions about why part of this program remains in resident memory....nice job ruining a perfectly good piece of software.t Money and TaxCut!this year and it really *irks* me.I understand the need for Product activation from a business perspective, but limiting it to ONE is draconian. C'mon...even Microsoft allows (2) activations of OfficeXP. There are several legitimate reasons why the software would need to be reloaded -- drive crashes, multiple PC's per home (desktop/laptop), home & work, etc.Intuit - if you you want me to buy your product next year, you'll need to either 1) *REMOVE* product activation or 2) Allow the product to be activated at least (3) times."
1,Loyal paying customer since 1992 - switching to Taxcut,"I just spent a 45 minute chat session with TurobTax technical support. The customer service agent cut and pasted a generic licensing statement 3 times: You cannot install turbotax on multiple PC's.Bottom line is that I cannot install TurboTax on both my home and work PC's, and have the choice of printing my tax return from whichever I choose. Ridiculous!"
1,Too worried about us stealing their product!,"After two weeks of dealing with poor technical support (the sound on the videos wouldn't work so I couldn't hear what they were saying), I finally asked for and got a new CD. Unfortunately, I couldn't install it because it kept telling me I had a bad product code, even though I called and got an authorization number on it.I gave up and returned it for a refund. I have saved some of their chat with me, and you would be amazed how rude those people are."
1,Thanks for the reviews. Worse than last year!,"I was preparing to purchase when I saw the reviews. Last years version made a mistake of $300 in favor of the IRS. The IRS sent me a letter explaining I had overpaid my taxes and they would make the correction (Intuit has yet to answer a single email about that)! That pales in comparison to the horror stories of Spyware and crashing hard drives. The impudence of Intuit is amazing. The value of the countless hours I've spent on MY (that deserves repeating) MY computer has a value many hundreds, if not thousands, of times greater than their program. How dare they put that at risk!! Thanks for the warning. Intuit??? never again."
1,Don't waste your money,"I don't like being accused of being a criminal as soon as I buy a piece of software, and I don't think the majority of consumers do. I dumped this turkey faster than a bad telephone call and went with Tax Cut instead.Ya see, that whole ""one computer"" thing is for the birds. I use more than three computers. In fact, I use 3 of them - laptop, home, and work machines. When I do my taxes each year I move from box to box and do them, moving my file around between the machines. I print the stuff out on each machine when I need to so I can double check figures. It makes life much easier for me to do it this way.Intuit lost my business this year. Hope they are going to make their stockholders happy."
1,A very bad experience,"I had read the poor reviews but foolishly thought I'd give it a try. After all, it was so useable in the past, could it have fallen so far so fast. Unfortunately, the answer is YES.The entire installation was disappointing, with the excessive marketing of their products, the subtle hiding of options to not get further emails, links to state products that were nonexistant, information that was inaccurate on their web pabes, and many, many more things.Intuit - You have lost a customer. I'm extremely disappointed in your product and how you treat your customers. This will be the last purchase of an Intuit product I make; and I have multiple products."
1,C-Dilla ... protection included,"...Turbo Tax now installs the C-dilla safedisc protection software when you install it. If you remove TT, c-dilla stays, it does not remove it. C-dilla can prevent your cd-rw from burning copy protected cd's, it can send download logs, cd-burn info, etc out to 3rd parties. Intuit states that the version of c-dilla they include does not do this, but, yeah, right!I uninstalled TT but still had c-dilla starting up as a service everytime WinXP booted. I had to manually delete files & registry entries to clean it out.After 5 years with Turbo Tax, I'll be trying something else this year, probably the free TaxAct."
1,This is the LAST TIME I'll buy TurboTax,"TurboTax has an invasive activation scheme with undocumented software that is permanently installed on your hard drive. I'm about to scrap this computer anyway, so I've installed it, but I recommend that YOU buy Tax Cut. I've used Tax Cut in years past, and it's just as easy and thorough as TurboTax. Intuit, go find someone else to run your undocumented, stealth ""security"" software."
1,Can't use this anymore,Don't buy this product! The activation scheme will absolutely make you throw your money in the basket. I can't use this program until I log on to the Internet! The computer I want to use it on doesn't even have capabilities for Internet. Bleh.
1,Knock..Knock..it's the software police,"Well..after I bought this years TurboTax & TT State (just like I have for the past 6 years), I took it home, opened it, installed it & found out about the Product Activation. Had I known about that before I bought it and opened the box, I'd be a new TaxCut user.I typically install TT on my home & work PC. I use the Home PC to prepare the taxes, and use my work PC to print out the returns out on a laser printer. Can't do that this year and it really *irks* me.I understand the need for Product activation from a business perspective, but limiting it to ONE is draconian. C'mon...even Microsoft allows (2) activations of OfficeXP. There are several legitimate reasons why the software would need to be reloaded -- drive crashes, multiple PC's per home (desktop/laptop), home & work, etc.Intuit - if you you want me to buy your product next year, you'll need to either 1) *REMOVE* product activation or 2) Allow the product to be activated at least (3) times."
2,"Disappointed with TT's activation ""feature"" so Goodbye TT","I have used TT for the past five years. I am very disappointed in buying this year's TT and now learning that it has a product activation ""feature"" that I strongly disagree with. Since I have already unwrapped the TT Deluxe and TT CA State products and mailed in the rebate request, I will use this year's TT to do my Federal and State returns. Next year, I will buy Tax Cut. I have really liked TT but will not install software that impacts my ability to upgrade my PC and does things that are ""secretive"" and which I do not fully understand.Jim MooreCupertino, CA 95014"
1,DO NOT BUY!!,I've used Turbo Tax for the last two years with no problem. This year it is pure junk. Nothing but problems. Tech support is totally useless. I will never buy again.
1,Can't recommend TurboTax This Year,"I've used TurboTax for many years and have recommended it highly. This year, unfortunately, I'm returning it to Intuit and switching to TaxCut. Ever since I installed TurboTax my computer has been flaky - particularly CD writing. I have no way to know for sure whether TurboTax is the cause but why take chances on a program that installs an extra program (C-dilla) whenever your computer is on - even when you're not using TurboTax? As long as there are reasonable alternatives I think consumers should take the advice of the Wall Street Journal column last week and avoid TurboTax."
1,Product Activation Forces Switch to TaxCut,"Count me as another voice condemming Intuit for their product activation schemes. I have been using (and paying for) their products for ~7 years. I believe that Intuit can try to fight piracty, but has to do so in a way that does not impact me (no Activation, no C-Dilla). It is not reasonable to restrict my use of the product to a single PC. I also think that Intuit did a lousy job communicating what they were doing with this aspect of the software. So count me among the many that made the switch to TaxCut this year."
1,Just say no! to c-dilla reg worm,"I talked to tech support at Intuit. If you run XP, c-dilla is there to stay!! I'm still going to use it this year but i'm putting it on the kid's computer (running ME) because I'll be reformatting it soon any way."
1,Changes your software without your permission JUST SAY NO!,"I had used TurboTax for serveral years without incident. It worked OK, but every time they 'enhanced' it, I found it more difficult to use. The interface gets more confusing every year (I support PC's for a living so it is not a matter of unfamiliarity).Then last year TurboTax upgraded Internet Explorer without asking me if that was OK or even warning me they were about to do it. There is nothing worse than some install program telling me what versions of other programs I have to run. My complaint to them didn't even warrant a email from an auto-responder.This year I see that Intuit is further dictating what I can do with my own computer.Goodbye and good riddance to Intuit and TurboTax."
1,Yet another bad review with some history,I started using TT in 1998 by using a friend's disk (stole it). It worked great. Turbo Tax didn't cost too much so starting in 1999 I started buying it. They got me as a customer because they had a good product at a good price and because I was able to try it once free before I bought it. Nothing I hate worse than buying something you can't return only to find out it is junk. The 2002 printer thing made me sware to never use TT again. Thing is they fixed it for 2003 so should we reward their fix this year or punish them for what they did last year?
1,Beware product activation bloatware,"I've used TurboTax for years and always loved it. Unfortunately, Intuit has included a product activation feature this year that concerns me. Be sure to check out the editorial cautions about the implications of the product activation feature at places like zdnet.com and cnet.com.As for me personally, after chatting with Intuit's admittedly excellent customer service, I've decided to exchange my TurboTax for TaxCut to avoid the uncertainty of product activation."
2,Turbo Tax Isn't What It Used to Be!,"I've used Turbo Tax for years but this is the worse one yet. I'm seriously considering purchasing another product next year. I just got off the phone with the IRS regarding an error on my return that the software calculated. When preparing my daughter's return for a part time job, the software asks if she's a college student. Well she is, and Turbo Tax gave her the credit that her PARENTS should have had. The only way to get around it is to answer no.I've paid too much for this program if I cannot trust it."
1,No more TurboTax for me.,"Copyprotection isn't a right when the company installs ""hidden, unremovable"" software on *MY* computer.The software they install is no better than a virus!Teach them a lesson; don't by software from Intuit any more!"
1,Former TurboTax User,"TurboTax is an easy to use product and I swore by it in the past. This year, however, I've switched to H&R Block's TaxCut as I don't want to deal with the limitations of product activation which Intuit has put into place with the 2002 program."
1,No Stars:,"After using TurboTax for many years, I had a few surprises when I loaded the disk I got in the mail. After installing it, I found there was an onerous online registration procedure that limits it to the computer you install it on.So now I can not complete my tax work at home and then take it to work to print it out. Or, if I have to go back a year or so from now to correct an error (something I've done in previous years) and have in the meantime upgraded or bought a new computer, I won't be able to use the TurboTax I bought and paid for.Plus, it puts some kind of software called CDilla that loads a some programs on startup that in my system caused programs that I run all the time to crash. I had to uninstall TurboTax and then do a lot of research to uninstall cdilla since it does not come off when you uninstall TT.I now am happily using Tax Cut.Doug S"
4,What's the big deal?!?,"What's the BIG DEAL?I've used Turbo Tax for years. I remember Intuit having a press release towards the end of the year about the product activation thing, but didn't really pay much attention to it.I've seen all the articles, and read up on Intuit's site. Decided that the familiar interface of Turbo Tax was important, so I bought Turbo Tax. I also came to the conclusion that Intuit or any other major corporation would not risk putting in jeopardy a multi-billion dollar product or the wrath of their shareholders by placing any sort of spyware on my machine.So I've used it, filed my taxes within 45 mins. No issues. No resource problems. Refund is already spent."
5,Still #1,Why do you use TurboTax? To get your taxes finished quickly and easily with minimum hassles. NOTHING HAS CHANGED! It's a great product.
4,printing alternatives,"If you are worried about using Turbotax this year with the printing restrictions, be aware that you can save your finished taxes as a PDF file on the ""registered"" computer and transfer/print that PDF file on another computer."
3,Activation Being sensationalised by paranoid users,"The reason the product activation is there, and you cant pass it along to your other computer is so you cant just hand the same copy round your friends so they can get the software without paying for it. All this paranoia about the boot sector being overwritten, and cd writers not working, its all nonsense !Activation is there to safeguard the developers rights, and it will be seen in more and more software as time goes on. Gone are the days when jonny could buy software x and pass it along to james, who passed it along to dave. How would you feel if you wrote the software and people were openly stealing it?Activation is not an accusation of guilt - its a protection of rights."
1,"After 10 years, I'm through with Intuit!","I have purchased TurboTax every year for the past 10 years. I have never given away their software to anyone. In fact, I encouraged others to buy it, also. To show their thanks, Intuit is using Macrovision's C-Dilla protection software this year. Bad idea! Treat your customers like thieves and you will lose your customers! It seems that it's time to move to TaxCut this year. You blew it Intuit!"
1,Bye Bye Turbo!,"Thanks to all the reviewers for flagging this problem. It's been fun, TT, but I'm moving on. And once I move to TaxCut, try and get me back. Ha!!- long-time TT user (now former user!)"
1,I am going to return the TT that I already bought,I tried to install the software and it told me to call their help line to get it activated. It will work only on one machine and I have to buy an additional copy if I want to use it on my home as well as a work computer.Switching to some other tax software will make sense and I am returning the one I already bought. Will be writing a nastygram to Turbo Tax.
1,My Last Year for Turbo Tax,I have used Turbo Tax and Quicken for many years but this is my last year for Turbo Tax because of their activation scheme. Turbo Tax is an excellent and easy to use program that works very well with Quicken
1,How to make a good product BAD,"I have used TurboTax for over 15 years, after this year with the Rebates and activation aggravation I won't be using it anymore......."
1,Downfall of Turbo Tax Deluxe,"I have used Turbio Tax Deluxe for many years and have never had a problem. This year (TTD for 2002) is a different story. I have had to install it twice and pay for it twice! I have written Turbo Tax a letter aboutr the problems and have yet to receive a reply (3+ weeks). There are more problems running the system than I have seen with any other software, ever! I recommend you buy an abacus or go to jail for tax evasion rather than waste your money on this product!"
2,need help fast...taxcuts vs. turbo tax,"I have used taxcuts in the past and have found it to be ok. I have a few years of back taxes to do and thought about switching to turbo tax, but after reading these reviews I'm afraid to. I'm not very computer savy and turbo tax sounds like the installation problems and potential for crashing are highWhat about the previous tax years for turbo tax, if you buy the 2000, 2001 versions do they have these problems that everyone is talking about?"
1,Never Again,Submitted federal and state income tax three (3) times and each time it was rejected due to LAST YEAR's AVERAGE GROSS INCOME (AGI) WAS NOT WHAT THE IRS HAD ON FILE.Filing 2002 Taxes - NOT - 2001 Taxes. Can't get back in to refile without being charged AGAIN.
1,Intuit ruined a once great product,If I am willing to pay for a program i shouldnt be bombarded by adds and telemarketers and have spyware put on my computer that cant be removed. I'm dissapointed i have to give up what was once a great product but no more intuit for me.
1,TurboTax Deluxe 2002 a poor choice,"The first and last time I purchase anything developed by Intuit after using Turbo Tax Deluxe. As you step through the program do your taxes you are bombarded by advertising to by additional products. Also beware of the fine print on the free state tax program, I ended up not using this feature because Intuit wanted a credit card number from me for this free service. For the average homeowner you can get everything you need from the IRS website and do your own taxes. So take the 39.00 dollars and spend it somewhere else and save yourself some frustration."
1,State tax -- Mass,"I didn't mind only being able to print out from one printer as others have stated, but the Massachusetts State tax will cause you to make errors if you are filing as a part time resident. I had to override several of my answers and get the hard copy of the instructions to avoid making costly mistakes. The software automatically assumes bank interests is Mass bank interests and doesn't give instructions on how to ommit non-mass-residency dividends and interest. Had to look at the hard copy which was very clear. Also, getting to an exact location in the state tax interview requires you to open a form and then go back to the interview. Every page should be available in the drop down menu."
2,"Get Tax Cut, not Turbo Tax","Intuit puts Turbo Tax on store shelves knowing full well it is an incomplete product. The first thing you have to do is log onto the internet and spend hours downloanding additional software that was not included on the CD. I suppose they do this to increase profits, but in reality they are losing customers, like me. I'll be using Tax Cut next year."
1,Faithful customers treated like thieves!,"I have been an Intuit customer for many years with Quicken and TurboTax. With their new policy, I and many like me are being treated like thieves. Understand the need to protect the intellectual properties, but I resent having software loaded that I do not want or need. Had I known this when purchased, I would have gone then to TaxCut. Living overseas I need flexibility to restore my system without making calls long-distance and for long periods to Intuit. Sorry, no more Intuit products for me. I will live with my older version of Quicken and switch to TaxCut."
1,Activation Hassles - Life is just too short for this....,"TurboTax is a great program - easy to use, very functional for its intended purpose. We've been using it for years and have been very happy with it. But, apparently the company that provides TurboTax (Intuit) has decided that us shiftless customers are not to be trusted, we could be pirating their software. So Intuit has implemented an 'activation' scheme to protect their software. So far the ""protection' has worked great. It has prevented us from using the software at all. After 4 calls to the ""customer service"" department, and a lot of time on hold, we still have not been able to get it activated. Yesterday on the 4th call, Intuit finally admitted they were ""having problems"" with the activation process, after initially implying it was ""user error"". They say they expect to have a 'fix' soon...What a lousy way to treat customers."
1,Save your money,"I recently purchased TurboTax deluxe 2002. It now requires a activation code to tie it to your computer. This feature did not work over the internet. I had to use the phone. The software focuses too much on trying to sell other services. Every few questions tries to get you to sign up for a service or more software. Finally the internet updates and filing did not work because I have a firewall. Intuit's solution was to disable my firewall and NAT software because they only work in a very restrictive network environment. If you are connected to the internet using DSL and have a Router/firewall, avoid this product and save yourself several hours of frustration. I'm returning the product for a refund."
1,I feel like a fool,"I read most of the bad reviews before I bought the program thinking the problems wouldn't happen to me. Boy was I wrong. After trying six times to install the program and getting a message stating ""cannot open file as read-only"", I tried to contact the online customer support line. Although they were courteous and responsive, my dog could have provided me more solutions. I hope Intuit will return this for me. Unless you like high blood pressure and self-induced hair loss, DONT BUY THIS PROGRAM"
1,Product activation scheme makes this software a no-buy,"I have been an Intuit customer for 11 years. I have always used Turbo Tax and Quicken. However, this year I purchased Tax Cut because of Intuit's product activation scheme. I refuse to buy software from a company that assumes I am a criminal. Tax Cut's EULA allows you to install and prepare taxes for the whole family. I have never pirated any software. Now Intuit won't have to worry about me - they lost me as a customer.By the way Tax Cut did an EXCELLENT job of preparing and filing my taxes. Tax Cut also costs less than Turbo Tax. What else do you need to know? Tax Cut is the better deal."
1,Insulting Spyware Policy,"TurboTax's new SpyWare policy is an insult to honestcustomers.Yes, I realize that there's a lot of ""pass this onto your friends"" going on with tax software. Butnasty spyware, that doesn't even uninstall whenthe TurboTax program is uninstalled, is uncalledfor.And I am not someone disappointed I have to payfor this software. I buy my software, thank you verymuch, because I write software, and believe developershave a right to be paid for their efforts.Unless you have a very specialized return that requiresa feature only available in TurboTax, I suggest usingTaxCut. For the most part, the major tax software packagesare interchangeable, and TaxCut doesn't use draconianlicensing procedures."
1,Ridiculous copy protection scheme,"I could live with the program being locked to a single machine -- if I could move it to a different machine. I installed to a desktop, then wanted to move it to my tablet pc I bought later. Intuit told me to go lump it. They literally said that if my desktop had been run over by a truck, they would have given me a new key; but in this case, I'd have to buy a second copy of the program."
1,"They don't trust me, why should I trust them?","I contacted their tech support about whether the product activation installs background programs on my system, and was told that ""all they could say about product activation was that it wouldn't affect my other programs.""Forget this -- I'm returning it and buying TaxCut 2002. If they can't trust me (a legitimate buyer), I won't put my trust in them, either."
1,Activation = No longer a TurboTax User,"I purchased this disaster and will no longer be a TurboTax user after this year. Intuit's idea was to limit use to one computer. Fine, but if you ever plan to get a new hard drive, or get a new computer, you will need a NEW license from Intuit to activate the software you already have a license to use. This is way too restrictive. Buy TaxCut. If Intuit puts activation on Quicken, I'll be a Money user."
1,New installation method scares me.,"I've lost complete trust in using the new Turbo Tax. The installation process requires a new ""product activation"" step that should be cause for concern.... I wish Intuit didn't force their customers to ""activate"" their software. Very scary.Sorry to say I've been a long time user, too"
1,What a crock [...],I installed it on my laptop to get started figuring out the program. About a week later I formatted the laptop drive to get my Vaio buttons to work (recovery disk). Now I want to install it on my desktop and start working only to find out I can't. I hope they can retire on what I paid for this because they'll never get another dime of my money. EVER.
1,Very Limited Flexibility,If you even think your computer may need to reload its software because of a crash or hardware replacement this product is not for you. Product activation is reverse software piracy and a pain.
1,My Last Year as a User - Great Job Intuit,"As you've read in all these reviews so far, this new protection scheme they are using is costing them yet another customer. This is the LAST YEAR that I will be using Turbo Tax. It's bad enough that they send the disc to me in the mail hoping I will submit my credit card and pay a very high RETAIL price for it. Now on top of that they hold me hostage to their new licensing scheme and treat me like a thief, not a paying customer. Been buying and recommending this product for 8 years, but will no longer support Intuit or their products. I feel sorry for their shareholders."
1,Zero Stars Should Be An Option!,"I've had the misfortune of using Turbotax for a couple of years now. I hate it every year and swear I will never use it again. With 10 years of personal software development experience, I cannot fathom what kind of morons came up with Turbotax. I'm shopping for another package this very night, and hope I can get it installed before April 15. I loathe Turbotax."
1,"AVOID TURBOTAX AND ""ACTIVATION"" WOES","I have used Turbotax for many years but after this year's experience I'll never buy it again. Their ""activation"" feature (actually an anti-copy attempt) makes it so you have to stay glued to ONE computer. Can't put TT on my laptop or on my office computer.I invoked the ""100% satisfaction guarantee"" and got my money back. Bought H&R Taxcut and it works better than Turbotax ever did.Save yourself a big headache. Switch to Taxcut and dump Turbotax.BEWARE: When you uninstall Turbotax it still leaves the anti-copy provision on your computer in a hidden folder. If you are not computer-literate enough to know how to deal with this you'll have it there forever."
3,Incompetent technical support,"The software insisted that I own a business, and would not let me select otherwise. I contacted their technical support via live chat (I will NOT pay for telephone support over a problem in THEIR product). I had to tell the tech exactly what the problem was 3 TIMES (he kept asking). Finally, I was switched to another rep, and had to go through the same mess again. This person told me to try some steps. While I was doing that, he/she ENDED THE CHAT SESSION! No warning, just dropped it. Turned out the steps I was given did not solve the problem, and I had to re-contact them and tell the story yet again.Poor communication, not paying attention to what I say, and they never did resolve the problem. I had to work around it for myself.If you buy TurboTax, be warned: if you need technical support, you're better off on your own."
1,Extra work to remove spyware,"I had to learn it from the papers (AFTER buying TurboTax), but the fact that I cannot use the office printer (as I usually did in the past years) AND I have to learn how to uninstall spyware makes this product absolutely worthless. Never again."
1,Thumbs down - way down on TurboTax,"Intuit has crossed the line. Not only do they market a mediocre product (at best), but their new license activation system further comprises the usability and value of the product. Like MS, they have decided to use their monopoly position against their customers. There are comparable if not better tax prep products that do not burden the user with unreasonable licensing policies. In summary, overpriced mediocre software with an unacceptable licensing scheme. Choose any other product."
3,"Scared to Buy, Scared to Change","I've used TurboTax for 5 years. After reading all of the horrible reviews this year, I was terrified to buy it again. However, I wasn't convinced to change to TaxCut after reading the reviews of that product. I've decided with a lot of fear to go ahead and try TurboTax anyway. The best piece of advice I picked up from the reviews was to install TT on the machine I will print from first, then install on my laptop. Even though I'm willing to try TT this year, I want Intuit to know that their brand name has fallen a great deal in my mind. I hope they respond to their customer base and fix the problems that everyone is having. Unsure about future purchases of TT."
2,Waste's lot's of paper!,"They seem to go to some length to make the program NOT-User friendly, or environmentally friendly. i.e., Even though I E-filed, it was necessary to print numerous pages that were duplicate's of the screen instructions. A back up copy of the actual tax documents are all that should be printed (give us some options, here).Then the rebate process is a test of one's patients (of course they want you to become aggravated and throw it in the trash). You do the forms, E-mail them to Intuit, print them out a copy to mail back and then you have to hand write those silly little cut-out forms with the exact same information...Phueeee!"
2,Spyware problem,"Mine was a slightly complex return and but turbotax handled it properly. The only problem is the spyware. My computer had a fujitsu hard drive, and as everybody knows there is callback on Fujitsu hard drives. But before, I could send it for replacement, it crashed. Thankfully, I had backed up all my data. But when I again tried to reload the Turbotax software, I had to buy software again. And the mail-in rebate is also paid only once so intuit milks you from all sides. Great way of making money, but I won't buy the software again next year."
1,My last year with Turbo Tax,"Warning -- you can only use this product on 1 machine. I understand the geniuses at Turbo Tax want to thwart piracy, but they didn't figure that such a bonehead move would frustrate their long time customers to the point where many of us will not use their product again.Taxes are hard enough, and we buy Turbo Tax to make this chore easier. Turbo Tax seems to have forgotten this fact. Their customer service is as friendly and helpful as the IRS."
2,You cannot print all forms in pdf,"I don't have a printer at home and have to use my printer at work to print the forms. Originally, I was hesitant to buy turbo tax this year because of all the bad reviews I read here. Then I read another review saying that you can save your file in pdf and print it on another machine. So I bought it.The truth is you cannot print the ""smart worksheets"" and form ""8423"" , a required form to be filed in California, in pdf. When I talked to the help desk, all they can say is you have to print it using the same computer you installed your software! I have been using Turbo tax for the last 4 years, I guess this will have to be the last one."
2,How Intuit can resolve this issue (but won't),"Here's how Intuit can protect its TurboTax intellectual property and still keep loyal users happy: Rather than allowing activation on one computer, allow it on three. This should provide ""fair use"" opportunity for most users -- they can install it on desktop, notebook and that new desktop they get for Christmas, say -- while preventing unsanctioned installations far and wide. But I'm not optimistic that Intuit, whose software is bogged down with cross-sell/up-sell solicitations, can overcome its greedhead inclinations and do anything so customer-minded. So maybe I'll have to try TaxCut next year. A pity ... I really liked TurboTax, otherwise."
1,Complain to Intuit About Product Activation,"I have used TurboTax for four or five years and found it very good. However, if I have a choice (and in this case I do) I will not purchase a program that contains any type of product activation.... For the record, I do not share my software but I do freqently reload, change hardware and beta test so activation becomes a real [pain] ...Enjoy!"
1,Watch out for the Intuit Virus,I don't have a real heartache with the product activation except for what happens when a company goes bankrupt and you can now longer use the software. The real headache I have with the software is that it installs a background task that runs all the time whether you running turbo tax or not. And it does not uninstall when you uninstall turbo tax. It clutters your root directory by creating a director called C_DILLA (sounds like a virus name to me).
1,Activation Horrors,"The activation process is a joke, And a bad one at that.I do not care about the ""one"" computer deal, as long as the program would work. And I quote from the turbo tax support web site ""The cause of this situation and it's solution are currently under investigation."" Now that ""they"" have my $$ they can not help me? No support on weekends?. What about a 24/7 support on the activation problem???? Thanks for the past, but this is no good."
1,Luckly we have alternatives,Unlike Windows XP. Hard to believe Intuit requires more nonsense steps to use the software than Windows XP. I have purchased and used TT since 94 and I have changed my computers for five times. In addition I usually installed a copy on my home PC and a copy on my office PC. Sometime my wife will installed a copy on her office PC so she could help to input data. It is time for me to try something else though I used to like TT a lot. Boycut Intuit!
1,TaxCut Next Year,"I've used TurboTax since 1986 and this is the last year. I would rate this product a 5 except for Intuit's activation scheme so I'll rate it a 1.While I had no problem activating TT using the internet, I now find that I'm going to have to reformat my hard drive in the immediate future. This will require that I reactivate the product to continue to use it. The same will be true if I change out the HD or buy a new computer. Also, each time I use the program, my registry is modified on the next boot which is a direct result of Intuit's activation scheme.I haven't let others use my copy of TT but I feel like I'm being punished anyway."
1,Product Activation indicates lack of trust,"Although this is a great product and does the job well, Intuit now requires product activation, in the style of Windows XP and Office XP. I've bought a copy of this software every year since 1994, but I will switch to a different product next year if Intuit continues to require product activation. After all, if they don't trust us with their software, why should we trust them with our taxes?"
1,Bonding to one computer is absurd,"Do you trust your taxes to one computer and one hard drive? I don't!After ten years, I won't even think of buying a product that I can't install on a backup or reinstall if something breaks on my computer. Intiut's support pages say you can't install even one backup!If Intuit is so worried, they should have a way to bond to street address printed on return or something like that. Something rational."
1,Not a good product,"I bought TurboTax Deluxe 2002 and have regretted ever since. First, the whole activation issue is annoying.... Also, I think it's rude that intuit installs...(C-Dilla). When you uninstall turbotax, C-Dilla ... stays on your computer.I traded in my copy of turbotax for TaxCut 2002 Deluxe and I'm much happier now. The programs are virtually identical (except that TaxCut doesn't install suspicious programs on your computer... I'm never buying turbotax again."
1,Turbo Tax Crashes My Computer,"I don't begrudge anyone for trying to protect their software from piracy, but their hidden software protection scheme crashed my computer, and there was no answer for technical support. Apparently it installs some kind of hidden program on your computer without telling you. I lost three days of work in my office while I waited for a support person to reinstall all of my software. I've used Turbo-tax for more than a decade, but never again. This software is too dangerous to install. It just isn't worth the risk that it will screw up your ocmputer. I'm trying a competitor. So long Intuit."
1,No advance warning of Activaiton problem,"There was no advanced warning regarding the activiation requirement. This version of TurboTax is really unacceptable. Intuit seems to be unconcerned with regard to customer satisfaction. ... The C-Dilla software that in installed with TurboTax is the same software that spys on your PC. And even if you remove the TurboTax software from your PC, the C-Dilla software is not removed!!!..."
1,Thanks to other reviewers . . .,"I have been using TurboTax since it was a Parson's Technology product! Like the others, I have always been pleased. Thank you fellow reviewers for sharing your hard earned experience with the rest of us. The value of my time, if spent recovering from some of the horror stories told here, would exceed all the monies I have spent with Parsons/Intuit to date.I too will buy elsewhere this year. Eternal thanks to the unfortunate who went before me. Has anyone called the Wall Street Journal?Sincerely,Gary"
1,Product Code Woes,"I've been using TT since it was Parson's Technology's Personal Tax Edge in the early nineties. It has always been an excellent program. This year, after unboxing the disc I'd purchased at Sam's Club about two weeks ago, I realized it had no product key code printed in the space provided. Simple problem, or so I thought, until I reviewed the FAQ's on the TT website. I Entered into chat with techsupport to explain my view that sending the disc to them and waiting for a return was unsatisfactory(postage fees notwithstanding.) They were so responsive, I'm now leaving for Sam's to swap it for TaxCut, much as I loathe Block!"
1,Another customer lost,"As I have for years, once again this year I took advantage of the TurboTax/Quicken rebate deal. I loaded both and didn't think much about it. I started having problems with my 3D graphics card (it wasn't being recognized as having 3D acceleration all of a sudden) and it wasn't until my friend Greg told me about this site and the spyware issue that I solved it. Last night I removed TurboTax and the spyware and guess what? My new graphics card now works. I ran out and bought TaxCut AND Money today. Unfortunately the folks at Money are almost as stupid as the folks at TurboTax; Money 2003 cannot import from Quicken 2003...it must be opened in Quicken versions 2 through 6 or 98 or 99 and saved in that format first. (like I keep every piece of old software I upgrade from!) So the jury's still out on whether I'll be rid of Intuit's products forever, but given a choice...."
2,A disappointment this year,"I have used TurboTax for many years and have been happy with the product. Not this year. I hated the 'tacky' advertisements placed throughout the product. It takes long enough to do my taxes now, I shouldn't have to waste time saying 'no' to an array of additional Intuit product offerings. Last year was easy with respect to the state program. The first state was free with TurboTax. Just download it. This year you have to pay for the state and then ask them for the money back. Was totally unable to register TurboTax. Every time I tried to register the product it kept telling me the server was down. I finally gave up. TurboTax couldn't find last year's return so I had to find it manually. Also, the tree structure is different from last year so I had to tailor my backup process to find this year's files. Next year it's Tax Cut for me. I'd rather do the taxes manually than deal with this stuff."
1,Hostile copy protection ruins a great product,"I've used TurboTax for years. From now on, I'm switching to a competing product like TaxCut. The installation worked fine, but I noticed it installed something else called CDilla by Macrovision. It has something to do with copy protection. Then I noticed that CDilla keeps running even after you shut down TurboTax. When I disabled it, it started up the next time I booted. I called to complain; Intuit told me to remove the CDilla directory. DO NOT do this! Now my computer won't boot and Intuit can't help me. I may have to reinstall Windows to use my computer again. It would be faster and easier if I'd done my taxes by hand. TurboTax is good, but it's not worth this much grief."
1,Software is not that good ...,"I recently purchased a new computer and tried to move my copy of Turbo Tax 2002 over to my new computer and the software refused to activate. I can Intuit and the support staff told me to buy a new copy. This is not right. I would highly recommend steering very clear of this type of software. Intuit is starting to act just like the IRS, drain as much money out of someone as possible."
1,Boycott Intuit,"""Product Activation"" is a joke. ... Intuit is paranoid and slaps this ""anti-piracy"" feature on TurboTax so once installed on one computer that's it. No backups. Customer service wont work unless you give your first born and your life story. Forget it. Don't buy anything from ...Intuit!"
1,6 years of using Turbo Tax ended now :-(,The title says it all.This is another case where they put their own greed in front of customer needs. This comment is not about the product itself. The product registration (or whatever they call it) makes it impossible for me to use. Brought it and returned it.
1,Used to be my favorite tax product,The product hasn't improved enough to have to deal with the headaches of activiation. I'm sending mine back under their money back if not satisfied policy. I'll be switch to TaxCut.
1,Switch to another tax preparation software package,"I have used TurboTax for years. However, I plan to never use this product again. They have unduely difficult activation procedures, and they secretly install the C-Dilla software to interfere with your ability to make legitimate copies of CDs on your computer. I understand their desire and need to contain piracy, but I do not condone their product installing software on my machine what may interfere with my legal and ethical use of my computer. You may want to look deeper into this issue before buying this product. If you do not, you were at least advised. My computer is contaminated until my taxes are completed."
1,Activation and State Download Problematic,"This will be my last year in TurboTax. Along with the [C-dilla] and activiation issues (covered in other reviews), the download and purchase process for the state return was difficult because of the way the software connected and the information given by the TT servers. Instead of just saying ""the servers are busy"" the program locked up my computer and froze my connection to the internet each time it failed.I am done with intuit.ants to steal software, who cares about the protection scheme? Use it for a few days to do your taxes and delete it when you're done."
1,Activation and Safecast is terrible,Intuit has made a huge mistake by requiring activation and adding Safecast to TurboTax. Reinstalling this software on a different machine in the future should be allowed without having to call the company....I have switched and will not buy software from Intuit again.Intuit - wake up. You just lost another customer.
1,Exchanged TURBO TAX for TAX CUT !,"As an experienced network security professional and privacy advocate I do not believe nor tolerate corporate entities promising me that the information they collect or the software they are installing on my personal equipment is protected or that they are protecting their software from copying.Regardless of what they do or say they cannot control the people buy it, use it, or their employees that have access to this data collected in ""their interest"". I paid the money and I should be able to do what ever I will with the product. To hook the software so deeply into my OS to the point that I cannot change any hardware or to prevent me to be able to make a perfectly legal ""backup copy"" is wrong."
1,Loyal 6 year Customer says Bye Bye Turbo Tax,"Been a loyal TT customer since 97. Never had a single issue with Turbo Tax - great product... Till this year. Tried to run the program and after installing, Vendor Error 8 - code 120. After looking it up - discovered [program] resident in my system C-Dilla . The Solution on the TT website says to Stop/start the C dilla stuff. OMG - what were they thinking when they tried this - offered to refund my money - which they'll have to since the program doesn't work (XP/broadband/Firewall). They also want me now to download the 'fixed' ... version from them directly - I think not. I'm shocked and saddened since I'm a loyalist. TTax goes back to my local retailer tomorrow and I'll have to try another competitor's SW.I realise this has been stated in several different flavors on here, but I'm a SW engineer , and if a program won't even run, let alone the fact that it's [C-dilla] that's what's causing the problem - I'd avoid this program like the plague."
1,Turbo Tax 2002 One Click Update Broken,"I have been using Turbo Tax for the past 5 years without many problems. This year is another story. I have been able to install and use the software, however, I have not been able to use the one click update option or the manual update option. I have spent about 5 hours talking to tech support on their chat line, re-installed the product 12 times (doing it different ways), I even tried their limited dial up account to do the update and was not able to get it to work.Next year it is H&R Block Tax Cut for me."
1,Good software with bad activation scheme,"From purely functional and feature view, it was a good piece of software and get the job done nicely. However, with the forced installation of spyware and the activation requirement, I won't recommend it and probably won't be using it. It would be the last thing I would like for someone to monitor my tax return filing. Yes, it should be alright for someone but any spyware to monitor what i'd done in my computer is not toleratable. I'm really concerned and disappointed with Intuit for this decision of making an otherwise genuine piece of software into a lack-of-respect-to consumer ..."
1,Much resentment over activation scheme,"I very much regret having shelled out for this product. The activation scheme will make impede my filing of the return. I typically fill out my forms at home where I only have dial-in, and then file at work where I have high-speed. Now I'll have to buy an additional copy, even though I only intend to use one at a time.Intuit management should think again before causing such great inconvenience to their customers. I'll be using H&R block next year!"
1,Turbo Junk...,"After using Turbo Tax since the Commodore64 days I found the product & support to be totally unreliable. After buying 2 CD's & trying their customer support I ended up downloading the 4868 form from the IRS so I could file an extension, since their was no way I could get this junk to load & not give me a runtime error before the post office cloed. As a small business owner I know that time is money & this has & will cost me plenty. Anyone interested in a class action suit?After reading the reviews here, I realize I wasn't the only one having problems & will probably have to hire an outside computer service to clean up the mess this thing left on the computer. No more for me, in fact I'm thinking about deleting ALL the annoying Quicken stuff too & start over with something that will actually work without all the hassles.HEY Intuit... Activate THIS!"
1,WIll not import Quicken data,"I have used TurboTax happily since 1995. This year changes to frowns. Product activation keeps me tied to my desktop PC. No roaming with the laptop. But the biggest issue is that it does not recognize that Quicken 2000 is installed on my PC, therefore will not let me import its data. Three attempts with 3 different on line chatters at Quicken ended with a recommendation to call the toll phone #, which is now closed. MS Money and TaxCut looking better and better. And I have tried so hard to stay away from the Dark Side...."
1,Data entry can't be corrected.,"I used the software version last year and this year did the online version. It has too many bugs. I accidently entered wrong data under tuition credits. It would not let me change my entry and the help section was not helpful. I finally manipulated the federal return but it had entered onto my state return and there was no way to correct or manipulate that. Then, after paying online for the product, it would not let me file electronically because it kept saying there was a tuition error to correct but WOULDN'T LET ME CORRECT IT! I spent many frustrating hours with it, searching the ... help section and there is no way to contact anyone or get my money back. I should have stuck with TaxAct.com or tried Tax Cut."
1,TurboTax 2002 and PowerQuest Drive Image,"I have been a satisfied user of TurboTax for some years now, until this year. I installed and activated a copy of Turbotax Deluxe 2002, which ran fine. A few days later I made a PowerQuest Drive Image of the drive and then reformatted it to do a trial installation of another OS. When I restored the original image to the drive this morning, TurboTax was no longer activated, and wanted me to buy another license! After a loooong time with the support folks, they made a one-time exception and gave me a new activation code. But of course I can NEVER again use Disk Image or change my hard drive --- Sorry Intuit, you just lost a good customer for future years......!"
2,Try other tax programs,"I've been using TT since its inception a decade ago. Last year, I thought of switching to TaxCut, based on price and all the annoying ads from TT, but decided to go with TT out of loyalty. This year, same logic, but was very unpleasantly surprised to learn of [C-Dilla], even more ads, and especially the required registration and activation. You essentially can only install this software on one computer [at a time.] I used to enter data both at work during my free time, and at home, and I can't do it now. Removing the software is time consuming. The software interfered with the operation of the PC (I have Win2K). It (the software)itself worked ok, but the same as the free TaxAct, which is downloadable for free (I have fairly complicated schedules A, B, and D). Would not recommend TT to you...."
1,Don't Buy 2003 either,I just visted (10/2/03) the turbo tax website to see for myself if Intuit had learned from their mistakes. They haven't. The spyware is still there for 2003(just in a different form) and the nightmare activation process is still there with their excuses. I'll be switching products this year after 9 years of loyal use. Good bye turbo tax!
1,turbotax for mac is ajoke too,"Have to add another review if it will save a mac user from buying this product. I too am a long time user. I finished my return ok but got an error message saying it wont print my 1040 because a form is out of date and I needed to load updates. I did, took almost forever, but blindly went back to error check - same error message. Went to tech support, said I could get help for ... dollars - paying extra for a defective program. Finally found the chat room and got a live tech person. He told me to uninstall and reinstall turbotax and delete some windows files. I said I had a mac and got a reply that the the windows files would be on the mac under the same name. NO WAY. Asked again how I could fix this problem and was asked ""do I have any other problems"" .... Well, that made me feel better, am now calling a tax pro."
1,Bought it last year. Won't buy it this year.,"Writing the boot sector of a machine is dangerous business. You can trash it totally. The only software that should do it is the kind of low-level system utility that you expect to be a little risky. That some piddling tax software thinks it's important enough to go messing with deep structures like that is offensive. Don't buy this software. If it doesn't wreck your machine today, it'll wreck it the next time you try to install something the least bit sensitive. Switch to tax software that doesn't think it's a system utility."
1,bad intuit,I have used Turbo tax for years and while I have been happy with the product in the past. I purchased taxcut this year due to the fact that Intuit had to go and put spyware into turbo tax this year. When are people going to learn that NOBODY wants programsinstalled onto their computer without their knowledge. I will notpurchase any program again from Intuit or ANY other company thatpiggy backs stealth programs onto my computer without my knowledge. Oh and yes I have read Intuit's response that it's notspyware...sorry not buying it.....bad business move on your partas I don't know of a single turbo tax user that is going to buy from you again.
1,Worse than I thought,"For this year Intuit does not support data importing from their own Quicken 2000.From the Intuit web site.""Import Quicken and QuickBooks data (2001 or higher) with our Just-In-Time Import""No only do you pay for TurboTax, but they try to force you to upgrade to a new version of Quicken if you are a user of Quicken 2000 or older. By the way, H&R Block Tax Cut does import Quicken 2000 data!! I tried it, and it worked.This is an unethical product tie. I bought Quicken 2000 two years ago in good faith."
1,There must be a better product!,I'd give this product zero stars if I could. Not only is their customer service worthless but the software comes included with spyware. The program worked until I removed the spyware then program was rendered useless. Went to tech support. They suggested I alter some ini files. Still didn't work. Uninstalled and reinstalled it (which put the spyware back on). Still doesn't work. Now I have to find some other PC to do my taxes on. I don't know about you but not everyone has a second PC. I have used Turbo Tax for many years but this is the last!
1,Another Longtime Turbo Tax Customer Bites the Dust,"Thank god I did not install the program they sent me in the mail. This whole activation number thing is a pain and I don't intend to purchase Turbotax 2002. I also thoroughly dislike installing software that cannot be totally uninstalled as my reading about C-dilla leads me to believe is the case.While I understand their concern about piracy, I also have the right to purchase the program that is the simplest for me to use and clearly from the information I've received, Turbotax is no longer that program."
1,Doesn't fill all forms out correctly,"Besides the anti-piracy policy, which is so much worse than anything I've run into before, it didn't even fill out all of my forms correctly. Why would anyone buy this product if it can't fill out a Schedule SE automatically?When it filled out all of the tax forms for my home-based business (I file a 1040, Schedule A, Schedule C, and Schedule SE), it didn't even fill out the schedule SE correctly. I had to go in and override the values, which weren't filled in at all!This means that if I had relied on TurboTax and not known what I was doing, or not proofread it, it would have definitely triggered an audit, and I would have ended up with a delayed refund. The mistake was over a hundred dollars difference in my final refund.I just wanted to add this, because everyone else seems to have an issue with activation, and there are other problems with relying on this software."
1,"No C-Dilla for me, thank you","Intuit has broken it's customer trust by adding stealth software that silently runs on a PC, consuming resources, all in the name of 'copy protection'. I'll have nothing to do with that."
1,New security features prevent backup or upgrading hard drive,"I have used Intuit products since the DOS days. I also have had hard drives crash before and lost everything. So now I backup my entire hard disk to a second drive using Norton Ghost. Everthing (except TurboTax 02) works fine doing this, even Windows XP. When I try and use my backup image, TurboTax comes up with an activation required screen. Maybe (if I am lucky) they will give me a new activation code if this happens before April 15. But I have all my Tax SW installed on my PC back to 1990. I am sure that in a year or more there is NO WAY they will give me a new activation code if my HD crashes. FYI, this also applies to simply upgrading to a larger HD, which I also do every couple of years. I dont mind having to activate the SW (like Windows XP) to prevent piracy, but REALLY hate what Intuit has done."
1,No More TurboTax for Me,"After loading TT 2002, I was unable to burn CD's. My software would start, but would never be able to successfully start the write process to the CD. I'm running Win2K on a 1 year old DELL computer, with 1yr old HP internal CD burner, and Easy CD creater 5. I've never had problems with this before. After uninstalling TurboTax and using the SafeCast uninstaller, guess what???? STILL CAN'T BURN CD's. Funny, Intuit claims that it has no knowledge of any problems with cd burners and then, on the Intuit web site, claims to ""not be able to duplicate"" the cd burner problems that it doesn't know about. HMMMMMMMMM.....Needless to say, I won't be buying any Intuit products again."
1,Registration BS just cost Intuit another customer !,"I refuse to be a slave to the stupid registration ""stuff"" and police-ware that comes free with this year's version of Turbo Tax. I have switched to Tax Cut and I hope everyone else does too. I would only consider using Turbo Tax again if they completely removed all the spy ware and registration restrictions."
3,"Good product, bad activation scheme","As a long-time customer, I'm really disappointed in Intuit. I recently installed TurboTax and was subsequently dismayed to find that the sneaky ""Safecast"" program had been installed without my permission.I'm removing Safecast as soon as my taxes are filed. Hopefully my CD burner will still work. As for next year, I think I'll take a look at TaxCut."
1,safecast,"I will not install my purchased copy of Turbotax until there's a way to run it without safecast, which installs a low level driver that chews up memory even when I don't run Turbotax. If I had not already opened my copy of Turbotax, I would return it."
1,Intuit Loses Long Time Customer - Permanently,Come on Amazon - there are times when 1 star is too high a rating and this is one of those times. I have been *purchasing* TurboTax for many years but will NEVER purchase another Intuit product. I will never trust the most intimate financial information I have to a company that automatically assumes I'm a thief. I've already purchased TaxCut and will be migrating my banking information to MS Money within the next few weeks. It makes no difference if Intuit removes activation and the C-Dilla [program] from their software - they CANNOT be trusted!
1,Used Turbotax for 10+ years........but no longer!,"Please don't buy this. The Macrovision C-Dilla is extremely difficult to remove, and Intuit's customer support is non-existant in this regard. Before I installed it, I checked out their website, which has no useful information on removing C-Dilla. And good luck trying to call and talk to a real human being! Intuit has ruined what used to be a wonderful product. TaxCut for me, this year."
1,Don't Buy This Product!,"I've used Turbo Tax for many years but this year, for what ever reason, the product is a nightmare! Difficult to install, difficult to register, customer service is a joke! Stay away from this!"
1,1 STAR IS TOO MUCH,"Well this has got to be the worst experience ever! The software is only allowed to be used from one machine, you cannot isntall and print on another. On top of that, this software has spyware that installs onto your system, which runs all the time!! Search the net for CDILLA, which is the supposed copy protection software that gets installed with turbo tax. I cannot copy cds anymore, the spyware gets installed on a section of the hard drive that could make your pc unstable! - I hope this post wont get edited - I am a professional in the industry and can prove my remarks. There have been several articles published by well - known web sites on this privacy issue."
1,New product activation scheme rendered it unusable.,"I've used TurboTax for nine years and been delighted with it...Until today. While attempting to install TurboTax on my perfectly ordinary Windows 98 machine, I was confronted with the error popup, ""Vendor Error 8, Tracking Code 120"".This apparently happens often enough that is rates a FAQ off the Turbotax page, and the suggested solutions after verifying that I'm using MS-DOS compatibility mode (I am) are 1) Install Turbotax on different computer, or 2) Return my Turbotax for a refund and use their web-based product.I think I'll return my Turbotax for a refund and use Tax Cut instead."
1,Customer Service,"Enjoyed this program last year but have been quite unhappy this year. It is almost impossible to contact Turbotax re problems.We never were able to get the program to work on a second computer.Rebate for State Program, filed in January 2003, was rejected in February 2003 with a form which states it was filed after the May 2003 deadline. Refiling has been ignored.Wait for customer service on phone is over 30 minutes. I was unable to get through the many menus to make contact on Internet. There seems no way to send them an e-mail.I have about decided to file my return by snail mail rather than get further involved with TurboTax."
1,Vote with your feet!,Don't make the same mistake I did - I unfortunately bought this program before I found out about the ridiculous activation routine and background applications it installs...
1,"Even if you want this, do not buy a used copy","This year's Turbo Tax has an annoying anti-piracy lock that won't let you print if you install it on more than one PC, so even if you want to buy it after reading the revealing reviews here, be sure to buy a fresh, factory-sealed copy, not an open package!"
1,After 5 years I will no longer use this software,"To make this short and sweet, I have had all the problems the other users had as well, and then when I was invoiced for my ""online"" purchase I saw that they even added tax on to the bill. What cheapskates! I'd buy stock in whatever company owns TaxCut because next year there's going to be a mass tax software exodus!"
1,misleading and deceptive,"I bought TurboTax Deluxe (vs. the regular product) because it came with a ""free"" state tax download. Actually, you need to first buy the state product and then file for a rebate of the purchase price, after jumping through all sorts of hoops and a mound of paperwork. I have long since thrown away the box that the product came in, so guess what: no state tax download.I called Intuit and--after wading through endless voicemail prompts for half an hour--told them this wasn't fair. The customer service rep said ""life isn't fair."" Needless to say, this is the last product I will buy from Intuit."
1,don't buy this product !,"turbo tax double bills...is almost impossible to call...if you crash or want to use 2 computers,you are out of luckcustomer service is arrogant and unhelpfuland virtually impossible to talk toafter over 10 years of using this product,I am ready to look for something else next year"
1,Glad I read the reviews,"I've used TurboTax for 4 years. This year I was getting ready to buy it again. Came to amazon to check price and began reading the reviews. Boy did they scare me. I decided not to take the chance and checked into TaxCut. Boy I'm glad I did. Just loaded it and began using. Spent about 2 hours and finished 75% of my taxes. I was worried it would take me forever. The sofware loaded on my W98 great. Imported last years TT fine. Updates over cable modem went without a hitch. It did freeze once in the middle of adding a capital gain (actually a loss). Restarted, went back to the form and it had saved all entries up to the crash. I love it. Better than TurboTax. It seems like the interview is more thorough. Glad they forced me to change!"
1,Intuit REALLY messed up this time....,"I've used TurboTax for the last three years, and it was fine...this year, with their activation and update problems, it won't work...I've asked for a refund. I'd never had problems before, so was unfamiliar with their support - this year, I've sent 6 hours (three times my actual tax stuff) with support and it is TERRIBLE and there's no toll-free, so I pay long-distance charges for 50 minutes on hold.....and the activation people are only available 8 - 5, so evenings and weekends you can't install the software....I'm headed for TaxCut!!!"
2,Soon to be former TurboTax Customer,"The ""free"" Federal e-file that you had to send in a rebate form for and the ads both scattered on my desk-top and within the program itself were bad enough. The product activation [program] this year was the last straw for me. After using TurboTax for many years, I don't plan to continue with it next year unless this stuff goes away. At least [C-Dilla] hasn't caused adverse affects to my PC system so far. A women I work with wasn't so lucky. Her system was so hosed up after installing TurboTax that she ended up having to re-install Windows/ME. I would have given this a single star but functionally the product was fine other than the annoying ads you have to go thru when doing your return. From what I hear though, TaxCut has similar functions without [C-Dilla]."
1,Turbotax installs a boot sector spyware-may crash your pc,crashed me but good. needed to boot xp in safe mode and uninstall turbotax and cdilla.
1,Loyal customer to Defect to TAX CUT,"As a customer of TurboTax for the past 8 years, I will go to Tax Cut next year. The problem with c-dilla has been an absolute nightmare. My husband (technical engineer)found the c-dilla process running and eating away at our system. (it is still causing problems that he has spent HOURS working on) This damn c-dilla has almost caused a divorce! To remain a loyal customer I demand Intuit CEO to make public press release stating it was a bad idea and the whole concept be removed from any future version or product! Trust me, your loyal, consumer to buy, use and recommend your product, rather than assume I am a criminal software pirate! My sister and neighbor have already bought TaxCut on my recommendation! I am buying stock in H&R Block, they will see an insane increase in sells thanks to Intuits c-dilla debacle!"
1,Back to the Basics -- Free,"If you have any sort of spread sheet, why bother with Intuit's lack of concern for you. Get IRS Publication 17 -- Free including shipping -- Make your spread sheet work for you -- You already paid for it. Up date it next year. If your taxes are too complicated for that, your best investment is in an accountant. The link: Go to IRS(.)Gov, Forms and Publications by Mail, enter Pub 17, put it in your cart and check out.PS. Short Intuit stock."
1,Watch Out for TurboTax 2002,"Unlike previous years, TT for 2002 has sophisticated anti-pirating built into the software such that it can only be used on one computer...period! This prevents you from preparing your tax returns using, for instance, your home computer, laptop and/or office computer. The only consolation you get for this is that your can print your output to a PDF file and take it to whatever computer you want. When you think about it this is a great inconvenience. DO NOT BELIEVE the claims of the Intuit website about how it can be run on multiple computers."
1,....,"If I could give this a rating of zero I would. Cannot install on my computer due to the ""activation"" issue and tech support offers no help. Will join the crowd and buy TaxCut instead. Lesson learned - read the Amazon.com reviews before purchasing!"
1,No activation required after October 15th,"Please note that after October 15th activation isno longer required. This slightly improves thesituation since if you change computers afterOctober 15th you can install the software again.But it really is too bad that you can't have it onyour notebook and desktop, or your home and workmachines.It isn't a program I'd choose to buy any more due toMacrovision and what C-Dilla installs in the hiddenarea of your hard drive.Very sad that a clueless product manager can do to suchdamage to a once fine company. They could have used amuch less intrusive type of anti-piracy protection andachieved their goal without alienating their loyal, payingcustomers...."
1,TurboTax user since 1996 but no more,"I've used TT since 1966. I've never given the program to other people or allowed them to use my computer/software to do their returns. I bought TT Home & Business 2002 last week and installed it as usual. I later noticed the folder c:\C_DILLA and deleted it. When I reran TT it made me activate it again and the folder reappeared. Now since searching Google Groups I have found two services running in the background on my W2K system. I've also learned that C_DILLA has written data to my harddrive that cannot be removed without reformatting. I had no warning that this trojan horse was going to be installed on my machine, or I would not have installed it in the first place.I am returning TT tomorrow and buying TaxCut. Intuit has lost a dedicated customer since 1996. I'm sure H&R; Block (owners of TaxCut) are thrilled to death at Intuit's stupidity."
1,Switch to Tax Cut,"This used to be the Gold standard for Tax software before the folks at Intuit got greedy. I believe that you ought to pay for any software that you use, but on the other hand, companies ought to be up front with customers when they put sneaky spy programs on your computer.Intuit violated this cardinal rule when it placed Cdilla on all copies of Turbotax. This program reports back to the servers at headquarters so that you can't load a copy of TurboTax at home and at work. They did not even put an uninstaller on the disk. When word got out about this program the company then put an uninstaller on their servers.Switch to TaxCut!!They don't have anything like this on their disks."
1,TurboTax 2003,"I got the email to renew for 2003. I never did uninstall c_dilla from 2002 and looked toward the intuit web site for uninstall instructions. Funny thing, not a single word on last year's fiasco, not the safecast uninstaller. In other words, they just want to bury the mistake rather than owning up to it.I'm going to wait to see how this one plays out. I am not renewing now. Suggest you don't do either."
1,NEVER AGAIN,"I installed TurboTax on my laptop, and the initial installation and activation was no problem. However (yup, you guessed it) - my laptop BOMBED. I mean, BOMBED. Everything was wiped out. I can't say what killed it, but it was dead.In the course of putting the software on my desktop computer (since the laptop was useless), I ran into problems as I'd already activated the turbotax software. I contacted intuit, and they said I had to buy my federal and all three states again. I told them that I understand one copy, one license, however, this event was a bit extreme. After 1/2 hour of arguing, I got my federal. Then another 1/2 hour of fighting to get the states.The product itself is decent (I've used it for the last 3 years), but I will never use this product again. It was way too much stress (not to mention countless hours of trying to get all the AOL icons and programs out of my computer).NEVER AGAIN."
1,I won't buy this product again,"I have bought this product for five years running, but won't buy it again. This year's version installs a program that runs in the background every time that the computer is started (called c-dilla). I noticed this program and deleted it; then Turbo Tax wouldn't work. I called Intuit and they said they couldn't help because it was my own fault."
2,"Activation ""feature"" poorly implemented","They say you can prepare a return on an unactivated machine, but that's a lie. I saved my .tax file when I needed to send my notebook for repair, reinstalled on the desktop and it would not let me work with the file at all!"
1,"Goodbye Intuit, and Goodbye Turbo Tax",I have been a loyal Intuit Turbo Tax customer since 1993 but will now say goodbye due to their disasterous marketing and the biggest mistake of locking me out of transfering my data from one PC to another.
1,XP Users Stay Away,"Buy TaxCut. Intuit has made it extremely difficult to use the 2002 versions of their Turbo Tax. In an effort to save themselves from piraters, they are going to run off their yearly user base and they know it. They are almost refusing to support and if you have XP, leave TurboTax alone. For some reason it seems to be causing major start up errors in XP. I have had to reinstall XP (3) times, each caused by the direct installation of TurboTax."
2,What Happened?!?,"I have used TurboTax for years. This year will be my last for two reasons: (1) Navigation. The index is terrible. Chances are if you need to jump back to a specific section (Home Office Summary, for example), be prepared to be dropped off 10 or so questions before it. Worse still, these questions are important, and even though you've already answered them they don't default to your last answer. Very frustrating. (2) Activation. Of all the years I've purchased TurboTax, I've never ""cheated"", ""shared"", ""borrowed"", etc. I don't like the idea that I can't use a piece of software that I bought on any machine I choose. Sadly I think activation is here to stay, arriving on more products by the release. I'll do what I can to discourage it by opting not to support such behavior with my money."
5,"One of the most overwhelming recordings of ""Duke"" ever!","""Far East Suite"" is a fabulous blend of rhythms, memoirs, affections as a dazzling homage concerned with the tour undertaken by his band in several countries of the Far East in the middle sixties.Innovative, original, inspired this recording won a Grammy Award by then (1966) and since its release became a referential issue for Ellington fans.Even if you are not a huge fan of Jazz, you should try with this recording. I swear you - my dear reader - you will never be dissapointed by it. And Far East will captivate you from the first listening.You've got my word. Get it!!!"
3,Great for teens,"When I was a teen I would have rated this a 5. I'm older now, and my tastes have changed. Still a favorite, but not nearly as good as I remember. I still recommend it, but not as highly."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Thanks God I got this free with my Aerogarden PRO 200. It is ok if free. But it is not worth even $10.00. It is the same you see on the aerogarden 30 min infomercial. The cutting mats are paper thin, the dvd runs each herb separate and only tells you the same that is on the herb guide included with every herb kit but a shorter version. A complete waste of money."
2,Didn't work for me,"I didn't end up liking this towel bar. It wasn't quite the style I was looking for. I wanted something a bit more substantial to anchor to the wall. The slight curve in the bar was nice. It gives more room to hang thicker towels. I just didn't like how it looked on my wall, too inconsequential. I wanted something a little more eye catching. The Sonora towel bar is very simple and plain. I ended up with something from Pegasus."
4,"A good series, and an enjoyable book","This one was different from the previous Cheysuli books, because it did not focus on one main character. The book was a lot weaker as a result, particularly because the three princes focused on are themselves not very interesting or likable characters. At times, this became almost exasperating, but I can't deny that the book engaged me emotionally. For all that I was frustrated, I kept reading. I'm glad that I did, too, because the end of the book makes it all worthwhile. Roberson really delivers. This book, as well as the series as a whole, are both definitely worth reading."
2,akcal,"This would be great for towing some buckets to a fishing hole, if you want to haul game you'd be better off spending $20 more or so on a Shappell. It too similar to a childs sled to justify the roughly $40 price tag."
2,Deer drag,"This product was not what exactly what I expected. The construction was too flimsy / easily deformed. The manufacture claims it will work with mule deer, but the unit almost folded in half with an average size white tail deer in it. The tie down system doesn't work well. The bottom has runners molded into it, but is also has some pockets molded in. The pockets don't help it slide. If you are able to load it into your vehicle with the deer tied in it, it does keep blood and stuff contained very well."
4,Love them,I loved the whole collection as a child and I love being able to share each book with my kids.
3,for Pimsleur addicts,"I confess, I am a Pimsleur addict, so I don't regret buying these in CD format. However, I must warn that these lessons were obviously developed for in-house publishing employees. The content is completely centered on the world of publishing, and will add very little new and useful vocabulary for others. Except that you will learn to discuss the novel you are reading with others. It does give you more experience with putting together the grammar you know, and adds a few new general phrases. But, it is not really providing much new material past level three. I wish Pimsleur would develop a true level IV with more grammer and content, or even ""vocabulary supplemental"" with the past grammar and tenses, but with lots broader conversational content."
2,too specialized,"Spanish Plus was produced with the same high production quality as the first three levels of Pimsleur spanish, but the reason i can only give it two stars is that it is much too centered around the publishing industry rather than the general conversation paterns of the first three levels. Also i was expecting more generalized coverage of the subjunctive tenses consdering how important they are in spanish as in other romance languages. The future tense could have been introduced also. It can be expressed with the verb ""ir"" but understanding it will be difficult without practice. In a nutshell, not enough new general material was introduced and too much time spent on a very narrow area. As happy as i was with the levels I, II, and III, i regret purhasing this one."
1,No lo recomiendo,"I can't be as kind as some of the other reviewers. This course is just awful. The packaging says ""At the completion of this course, you will be able to speak and understand Spanish at an advanced level"". But this is not true at all. The main focus of this 10-unit course is on conversations related to the publishing industry. There are many words that you are asked to repeat, which were already introduced in the Pimsleur beginner-level courses. How many times do you need to repeat ""Vivo en Estados Unidos"" before you understand it? Also, I can't imagine why the designers of this course think it's useful, at an advanced level (or any level for that matter), to repeat place names such as ""Montevideo, Uruguay"" using a Spanish accent. This course may give you the opportunity to practice some of the Spanish you've already learned in earlier courses, but you will learn very little that's useful in the real world, unless you're planning to become an editor, or to write and publish a novel."
3,More great conversation practice with Pimsleur,"I love Pimsleur but I have to agree with the other reviewers. The vocabulary in the Plus series is a poor choice. However, it is another ten lessons of conversational practice and there are a few good nuggets presented as well.So in short it is a something of a let down after the first three series but it is still worth it especially if you pick it up used."
5,What a book!!!,"This book helped me out so much. I have some learning disabilities and after reading this book, I found it so much easier to find the right colleges and programs for me. Anybody with a learning disability - or even if you just know someone with a learning disability - should buy this book!! Thank you Aliza J. Sokolow!"
1,What a waste!!!!,"I am senior in high school, who suffers from adhd, as well as many other forms of learning disabilities. After reading the great comments on Aliza J Sokolow's work, i decided that i would give it a shot. Not only did it not help me in anyway, after using the information and applying it to my own college experience, my acceptance was revoked. Now having no options for a college anywhere, i am working a 12 to 8 job at Mcdonalds as a fry tosser (Though my manager says that my work has been great and if i keep it up i will be promoted to intercom drive through attendant within a month) My life is over....Enjoy the Book."
5,Fascinating Medieval Exegesis,Richard of St Victor was a great thinker and traveller on the mystical path. The works contained in this volume provide a fascinating glimpse onto the uses of scriptural allegory as Richard unites the Latin and Greek mystical traditions into a synthesis all his own. He was very influential for those who followed him. The student of medieval mysticism will find this book a delight.
3,Not the Best...Not The Worst.,"Reading previous reviews One would think this flick was on the level of MASTER KILLER or a VENOM'S series film. It's really pretty standard fare for this genre and the ending is silly without any real closure. That said, the end fight was (as usual) the best in the film and there is a very funny (in a sick sort of way) scene where the 2 protagonist ( one hesitates to call them heros as there motives were money : ) fight a group of lepers. Just imagine the potential for physical comedy!Oh well, I doubt they would get away with that scene in Hollywood!!"
3,Fists and Guts(1979),"Fists and Guts(1979) is a decent kung fu comedy starring Gordon Liu. The Chinese title means ""One Courage Two Will Three Kung Fu"". The strong violence in the film is quite limited. The leper colony scene is tasteless. There are some strong redeeming factors. The film's leading lady is a pretty Chinese woman. She made a brief appearance in the Sean Connery movie Meteor(1979). It's fun seeing Li Hai Sheng play a good guy. He played countless bad guys in Shaw Brothers produced movies. Gordon Liu plays a Buddhist monk who searches for a thief played by Lo Lieh. Most of the film is taken up by filler scenes. Liu will follow some red herring or Li Hai Sheng will expose con artists for laughs. The Tai Seng DVD has an audio commentary track from kung fu movie fan Ric Meyers. Fists and Guts is a decent movie."
1,A waste of Gordon Liu's talent,This movie has about 3 good Gordon Liu fight scenes in it and other than that 15 minutes or so the rest is just the worst sort of unfunny 70's kung fu movie zany hijinks. HK fanboys will want to see this and skip directly to those 3 scenes but everyone else should avoid this movie.
1,what?????,a 2.4 ounce pack of crackers for how much? This doesn't make any sense. I am hoping this is some sort of mix up.
2,Don't know what I was thinking.,I heard this artist on a radio station long ago and thought she was great live. The songs on this CD ran together in one monotonous theme. I normally like indie female vocalists but this just didn't do it for me. Sorry.
3,Not a bride and groom cookbook,"This cookbook is a perfectly nice little book, but there is nothing ""bride and groom"" about it other than the title. It is obviously a cookbook marketed toward women, just like most other cookbooks, and the recipes are not practical if the newlyweds don't eat AND cook gourmet. The dessert and drink menus are great, but the dinners did not appeal to me."
2,Disappointed in Vexed.,"We bought Vexed after reading the positive reviews and were disappointed in the series. The actors, storylines and production were top notch, but something is definitely lacking with the quality of writing here. The set-up is perfect to be really funny, but, instead, we found it to be shallow and coarse. If you like the more mature humor of Moonlighting, Life on Mars (UK version especially) and New Tricks, then you will likely find Vexed to be less appealing. We are sorry that two such wonderful actors as Toby Stephans and Lucy Punch are being held back by trite and underaccomplished writers. Edit 1/2013: Recommend the Castle series for a lighthearted crime drama."
3,Too much,Contrived and unreal events. Two beautiful people with all this angst? Really? Hard to follow the script due to dialect and supposed history between the two main characters. Gruesome.
3,Cute first season,I enjoyed this. There were quite a few laugh out loud moments. Not as predictable as I expected it to be.
3,There were funny parts.,"There were some funny parts, but I did not find the characters very engaging. I enjoyed it, but would not care to see more. We watch a lot of BBC mysteries and this was not among the better ones."
4,80 Days of Pleasure,"4 Stars not 5. I'll tell you why: This new digital disc is a pleasure. The added tracks are great. The sound is great. The score is great. My only complaint is why oh why was an alternate track used for the opening track. Why wasn't the same track used as on the original LP and earlier CD on MCA? On this new version track 1 ""Around The World"" Part 1 ends in a whimper. The earlier version, this track ends with an explosive climax (tympani and a fantastic cymbal clash). What is wrong with these people? Didn't they think anyone would know the difference? That's the only thing that spoils this release for me. 4 stars not 5!"
3,More Around the World?,"It is good to have the crystal quality of digital sound (and also stereo -as the original LP is rare in stereo). It really makes much of the instrumentation much more clear, and adds greatly to one's enjoyment. OTOH, if you are looking for some great new music from the added tracks you are certain to realize why they were not included way back when. If you have a CD of this already, don't bother to get the 'expanded' version."
5,Uplifting and side-splittingly funny - yet touches the soul!,I first read this book after reading the Secret Diary of Adrian Mole and was expecting something along the same lines. What a surprise. This book was one of those that you pick up and read and while the tears of joy roll down your cheeks the message seeps into your heart. An absolute delight Mr. Plass and a real mirror to ones own views on churchlife and Christianity. If you haven't already savored this treat you should!
4,Cookies that taste like a Hershey's Cookies N Creme bar/Oreo cookie,"I'm not a huge fan of the Hershey's cookies and creme bars because there's always so much white chocolate. This is a little more cookie-y so I like it a lot better. The chocolate cookie itself tastes a lot like the cookie part of an Oreo, but a little less dense and a little less chocolatey. The creme itself tastes kind of like the white chocolate in a Hershey's cookies n creme bar, but MORE like the icing on those pink and white iced animal crackers. Overall, it doesn't taste a LOT like an Oreo, but it definitely tastes more like an Oreo than the actual Oreo 100 calorie packs."
2,Don't try this at home...,"While the overall quality of Keebler's line of regular cookies tends to be quite good, their version of 100-calorie shortbread cookies is a true miss.Pros: You get a large quantity of mini cookies per pouch (in comparison to Pepperidge Farm 100 calorie varieties.)Cons: Any essence of a ""shortbread"" flavor was completely lost to these crisps' just-sweet flavor.I won't be purchasing these in that future. For those seeking a very decent portion-controlled shortbread-type crisp, I highly recommend either Nabisco's Lorna Doone (sweeter), or Pepperidge Farm Chessmen (very buttery) both in 100 Calorie Pouches."
3,Light tasting but falls short of the original ones,"These are fairly good but they are not as tasty as the original pecan sandies. They do make a healthy convenient little snack ,however."
3,Not as good Pecan Sandies!,"I like Keebler's 100 Calorie Snacks,but this one far from my favorite,there kinda bland and not as good as their Pecan Sandies! There far from bad cookies,there just not that great either! I've had much better!"
1,Tasteless and Tiny,Don't waste your time or money with this product. The cookies have very little shortbread flavor and are no bigger than the tip of your finger.
4,Fun moves and music.,"This workout is fun. I found myself smiling the whole time. It is much more difficult than the original workout. I was sweating in the warm up. There is more jumping than I expected, but they do mention low impact options where you can step rather than jump."
