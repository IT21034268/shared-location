5,Very informative message,The book has made me aware of the process of healing and aware that it is most usual to improve to a point then relapse before true healing progresses. Thanks *v* J
3,Healing Crisis,This book has many good ideas on healthy eating and living. It has a few too many testimonials but a very good read and easy to understand his writing.
5,Raise Your Glass in a Toast to Rocque!,I feel privileged that their Lordships have deigned to grace a lout of my plebeian stature with this glorious platter of anthems. I will indeed eat anything that the esteemed noblemen suggest that I eat-AND LIKE IT!
4,Fantastic and easy to ues,This jig is so user friendly and quick to set up! I used to have a router dedicated to each router dovetail jig. Once it was set I was too afraid to change it. With the Porter Cable quick set adjustment pod I don't have to worry about changing depths anymore.The only thing missing is adjustable fingers which can be purchased seperately...$$$
4,It's rock n roll stupid....,"Forgot all the hype, forgot the good looks, sharp hips, pretty lips, this band flat-out rocks. You read it here first. These folks are gonna be big. From Johnny to the end, you will find yourself wanting to get off your big behind and boogie. It is the next big thing from Portland, OR, and you can be the first one to get on the bandwagon before it's even hitched. Guaranteed!"
4,Filling aural space,"Smooth, seamless bass rhythms lay the foundation for the ambient-reggae instrumental stylings of Bill Laswell and his ever-growing stable of musicians. Going beyond the Jamaican dub tradition, the musicians seem to push out from the speakers in an effort to fill the space with their presence. This is strong stuff."
2,Not quite as advertised,"I am very disappointed by this lamp, especially because I was guided by the reviews posted by other customers. I bought it to use as a bedside table reading lamp. First, it is not beautiful or elegant in any way to my eye, but very utilitarian in appearance. Secondly, despite the anti-glare filter, the light is very harsh. Third, although it has three levels of intensity, all are too bright. Fourth, it does not ""telescope"" as advertised, but merely rotates on the hub. Fifth, it is not as well-constructed as I had hoped. The lamp rotates at the central hub and at the base of the light, and both screw-like connectors tend to slip and look like they will wear out. For the price, I expected something better made, better looking, and not as glary.It probably works better as a desk lamp. I will have to return it."
4,"Personal, Even Quirky, but Worthwhile Reading","John Lukacs writes in a clear, elegant style and he has the charmingly old fashioned habit of censoring four-letter profanity when others are directly quoted. As this is a subject exhaustively covered, researched and analyzed for over sixty years it is unrealistic to expect many new facts here. New insights may arise even generations later, however and this slim volume has enough to make the reader stop frequently to ponder and say ""Now, why didn't I think of that?"" or take issue. Prof. Lukacs' fresh look at the term ""isolationism"" is by itself worth the priceAs to taking issue, Prof. Lukacs is not shy about criticizing the work of other historians or biographers--even quite eminent ones and even in a cranky tone. He is a one-man school of historiography, neither right-wing nor left, European oriented or wholly American, ideological nor determinist.This book is valuable."
3,An informative if somewhat difficult read,An informative book covering a pivotal time in World War II. It's just a pity that the author's language makes it such hard work to read.
3,An author past his prime,"I find the author - whom I respect - more than willing to find ""new"" ways of interpreting facts that are already well known. The most obvious of these attempts:it seems (in Lukacs view) that Hitler invaded Russia only to force an agreement from a position of force with England. But then there are a number of indications leading to the ""classic"" interpretation: that Hitler always respected England, and wanted Lebensraum, despised the slaves etc.Additionalliy, all over the text there are scattered alusions to historians who -different from the author- seem not no have grasped what whas really going on. Only Lukacs seems to see the whole picture."
1,A very shallow treatment of available literature and facts,"This is a very disappointing book, especially given some of Lukacs' earlier works.The author has not consulted the latest available material about Stalin's offensive war preparations against Hitler. His treatment of the Stalin-speech to the Politburo on August 19, 1939 is also wrong. Lukacs claims that the speech is a forgery, but in fact it's contents have been confirmed by the diary-entry of Comintern-Leader G. Dimitroff (see his long entry on Sept. 7, 1939) and the instructions to the Communist Parties about how to jusitfy the Pact with Hitler.The book suffers from Lukacs' inability to read Russian books and his shallow overview of available material in English and/or German laguage.Not recommended!"
4,The Politics of War,"Imagine a noted historian sitting down one day with you to help you understand one of the great political/military questions of the last hundred years---Why did Hitler invade the USSR in June of 1941? John Lukacs gives his informed thinking on this and related questions in this short but highly interesting volume. This is not a tale of specific military movements but one of the deadly political motivations and purposes of two powerful world leaders.The prose is clear, with opinions sharp and cutting."
5,This should help you figure out which Blink182 CD to buy...,"If you are playing that game where you are trying to decide which Blink CD to buy. Then listen up. I have all of their CDs and love all of them. I am going to categorize each CD cording to which ones are the best for things you are looking for. Here it goes...- If you like speed pick up Dude Ranch or Jacket- If you like Rawness pick up Cheshire Cat or Buddha- If you like hardness, pick up Dude Ranch or Enema- IF you like Catchiness pick up Jacket or Enema- If you like Melodic punk pick up Buddha- If you like good CDs pick up all of themHope, I helped."
5,The best of the best :D,"A blink 182 fan must-have, Cheshire Cat has been my favorite album. I used to only have the digital copy from Amazon mp3, but that wasn't enough for me - i needed the actual CD. And thanks to amazon, this was made possible! xDI recommend this album to anyone who wants to listen to some crazy great music and listen to a few to the most creative lyrics you will ever hear. You'll be surprised to see how you will fall in love with this album :D"
5,This Is Punk,"This is Blink Finest Album. Hard Fast Guitar and Drums with loud flat vocals to leave anyone over the age of 20 in tears. People just don't understand that this is an album which will soon be a collecters item. Indeed the finest cd that Blink has put out. There newer albums....Nothing to write home about, although Cheshire Cat is and unbeleivable recording. If anyone calls this Pop Punk or Rock, they don't know anything about music...THIS IS PUNK AT ITS BEST."
5,Speak Up,"Yeah, of corse! This CD was good! Blink 182 can spread their cool and reality reaching lyrics in so many ways!Along with their popular Cd's, like Enema, this CD should speak up so everyone can enjoy it. Its just as, if not more, punk and wild as the popular top chart Enema.Support those boys and buy Chesire today!"
2,Good indication of what was to come,"This album should have been a good indication to everyone that they suck, but they got popular anyway."
2,Top Drawer,"Everything by Blink 182 is outstanding and if you like Enema of the State and you want to hear more go out and buy Cheshire Cat. People say that they are a sell out but so what, they are cool guys who make cool music. The best songs on this is Carousel and Romeo and Rebecca BLINK IS THE GREATEST"
4,"Not as described...sold by Bookconsignments.com, LLC","I love the cd and blink-182 but the cd I bought was listed supposed to be in very good condition. When I received my package and opened it I noticed that a piece of scotch tape was holding the top part of the case to the bottom part. So after 5 minutes of struggling to get the tape off I was enthrilled. And then I opened the case and the front part fell off hit the ground and broke the connecting piece. After 10 minutes of dismay I picked up the broken pieces and put them back on the case. And soon I will grab one of my other empty cd cases and take the top off of it and replace it. I say all that to say this... Bookconsignments.com, LLC lies about their product condition so be wary of that if buying from them. As an Amazon community, the people that make amazon what it is, we have to look out for each other. I'm just doing my job in our troop."
2,Not Good,"Well what can I say about it, it's not the best punk cd out there and their voices aren't developed as u can tell on their other cds. I wouldn't buy it if u r just getting into them, Get Enema of The State first to see what they are capable of then maybe this cd if u still want to try it."
5,It's a real Cheshire,"This cd is such the best! Blink 182 really did great on this cd. Especially the song ""Dammit"" They went to the top with my reaviews. I'd give them alot more stars if only I possibly could. they are just to great! So if you want good, you've come to the best place ever my friend. It's just too close to perfect. There is allot of good songs on this cd. So just remeber, It's great and a real Cheshire!"
4,How do you sell out?,"I was just looking through some past reviews, and someone claimed that Blink 182 has sold out. How is it that the second that a band makes it big they are selling out. It is their job. I don't know of any band that has been offered a record deal and turned it down in order to play small clubs for a few hundred bucks a night. It doesn't happen, therefore i suppose every band with a contract is a sellout. If you like a band, listen to 'em. I don't think it makes any difference where they came from or how they got here. peace."
2,Not that good.,"Blink-182 is an overrated band altogether, but their old stuff is especially overrated. Every song sounds EXACTLY the same. No memorable riffs or creativity. Vocals are typical punk shmuck, and at times sound off-tune. The actual difficulty of the musicianship is remarkable (especially the drums), but whats the use if you cant write good songs? If you like this CD, I appreciate that, but I guess I just prefer bands with more musical styles and creativity..."
4,this cd is great,this is by far the best blink cd at of all four of them. The best song is carousel.
3,not the best,"i absolutely love blink. but seeing as this is one of their first cds, it could certainly use work. the production quality is poor, a handful of the songs are really good like carousel, wasting time, and touchdown boy, but some of the songs arent up to par like ""sometimes"". its cool to see where blink started out and see how they've progressed.i feel like i would like this cd a lot more and appreciate it a lot more if it were rerecorded completely with today's music equipment, new vocals, etc. it would sound much better. because the songs themselves are very good."
4,Blinks Best,"Blink 182 have gotten progressively worse during their carrer, but Chesire Cat is pure genius. Lyrics that speak to me so closely it scares me, very funny and good guitar playing by Tom. Dude ranch was acceptable, Enama very much different but good, but Take Off Your Pants and Jacket is dispicable and Blink 182 should be ashamed. And box car racer is a joke."
5,Blink 182 fan,Blinks first cd different sound the the newer stuff but still awesome!Favorite songs1.Wasting Time2.Carousel3.M&Ms;4.Strings5.Touchdown Boy
2,Their best CD,"That's right this is their best and it's only getting 2 stars. You know back when the Ramones did the punk thing, I'm sure they wouldn't have if they new crud like this would be spawned form their invention. Blink 182 are a bunch of immature, unfunny, untalented losers, who said themselves that they are only in it for the money and the girls. Not the kids, just the materialistic stuff. All the bathroom humor is getting really old. It's no longer funny. Don't even get me started on their live shows. The guys can't sing at all and whatever glimmer of talent they do have is studio produced. This sounds worse then you sunday school band playing hymns. Seriously. Oh and the voice, the whiney and annoying voice that is like experiencing fingernails scraped across a chalk board. YES it's that bad. This is the closet these guys ever got to being pop-punk, but then turned to Nsync with instruments. Whiney, lamebrain posers, and MTV will eat this up. It's another stupid trend."
1,LOOK AT WHAT IT DID,"i put this cd into my cd player the second i got home from the cd store.as soon as i pressed play,my cd player blew up and burned down my house"
1,A Turning Point in The Worst Cds Ever,"If at once you are able to listen to this album without having the urge to deystroy yourself, then you will immediately become lost in the bitter, soupy mash created by the whining and toneless guitars and the constantly banging drums. I promise to you that they repeatedly took the same drum track and used it over and over for each song. I wish I never heard this album because of the scarring effect that it caused me. Listen to God, not Blink 182"
1,this cd sux!!!!!,all the songs are almost exactly the same. i have to put my cd player on high to actually hear something. real bad recording! get any blink cd after dude ranch.
1,taylor from manchester is soooo wrong,taylor from manchester u r wrong dashboard is awesome so leave chris alone and go listen to your meaningless crap known as blink 182
1,get ShOoTyZ GrOoVe not this,face it blink-182 soldout this cd sucks there is a band out there better than this band they are called shootyz groove and they rock. There the jive of this world not this one year old band.
3,Not as good as the others....,"even though cheshire cat is a pretty good listen, i don't think it is as good as their other two albums. it does not sound as polished, and while some may find this more appealing, i prefer dude ranch and enema of the state. it shows a band that, while very talented, did not know their true potential. vocals are particularly weaker on this album, but this could be considered better because they have not been mixed and warped and edited by big studio high-tech sound equipment. big blink fans will love it, but those who are expecting something similar to enema will be disappointed."
3,The early years,"If you only know Blink-182 from Enema of the State and/or Take off Your Pants and Jacket, this will be a whole different experience(though not neccesarily a bad one).Cheshire Cat seems to have a somewhat(somewhat, not altogether) more serious tone than both, Enema of the State and Take off Your Pants and Jacket.The sound is different too, though you will recognize it as Blink-182 still. The production leaves something left to be desired, but then again, it gives the record an ""authentic"" sound, which, once you are used to it you wont be without.The songwriting in my opinion is still strong, and Blink-182's wacky humor is still shine through on tracks like Ben Wah Balls. The songwriting seemed to take a turn for th better on the 1997 release Dude Ranch. All in all, this album is propably more for the hardcore fans than for the casual listener."
3,Not Bad Overall,"Cheshire Cat is a good album overall, but it could have been better. You can tell that they are still maturing their music on this album. They should have spent more time editing it, because they are off at some parts of the songs. It is certainly not their best. Dude Ranch doesn't even compare to this album. Carousel is still probably their best song they have ever done. I don't like Just About Done, yaeh it's funny but it gets annoying after a while. But the rest of the music is good. So if you are a die hard Blink fan, you should get this."
5,Blink 182 ---still good!,"Hmmm...not a bad cd. Its a very good album, definetly if you liked them ever since they became a band. Even though their voices may seem a little off-key in some of the songs, they're still good! You can tell that their voices have improved with their recent one, ""Take off your Pants and Jacket"". On Cheshire Cat, there are some funny songs. Actully I like all of them! ^_^ So basically if you're a fan of blink 182 and you like their music before Enema of the State, then you'll like this album! (oh by the way, their new album rocks!)"
4,this was pretty good but not as good as the rest,"this was a pretty good album. the best songs are touchdown boy, romeo and rebecca, and ben wah balls. most of the tracks were good but those were the best 3."
3,rental at best,"well, i made the mistake of picking this movie up after reading the product description and coming to the conclusion that, for the price, it was a steal. for the first hour or so the movie is interesting, however *SPOILERS AHEAD* after the death of a certain key character the movie slips downhill. *END SPOILERS* even more so, i felt as if i was ripped off by the ending, which is quite predictable if you know movie cliches. this movie is a rental at best."
3,The book was in expected condition,"The book had a little more highlighting than I would have liked, but it's in overall good condition. I am pleased with the purchase considering the money I saved buying it used...."
1,Surprisingly bad workmanship!,"Having just received this as a gift from my stepdaughter for Father's Day (which I coordinated with my wife based on the other reviews here), I am especially disappointed at the horrific quality. The pieces are so poorly made that they are tilting, wobbly, and easily fall over on their own during play. Some of the pieces were cut haphazardly and the black King tilts like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. It would be funny and a no-brainer to simply return if it weren't for the shock after the positive reviews. It makes me suspect that the other reviews are placed by people at the company who makes this item. Hate to say it, but this set is crap and absolutely NOT worth the money. And I think the reviews are quite possibly placed by shills, not actual customers. Junk, junk, junk."
2,Fony Blackgammon,"This so called Deluxe Wooden Chess, Checkers & Backgammon Set (Oak) IS TOO SMALL; THE SELLER did not disclose the size of the backgammon.IF I knew that it is too small in size I WOULD NOT ORDER IT.The seller did not want to pay the shipment cost;SO I NEVER RECOMMEND THIS BACKGAMMON SET to ANY BODY.Sedat"
2,Doesn't Surge for 3100 Watts,"I've had one of these units for a few years now, and it's worked pretty much as described except that it won't surge for the rated capacity (1250 watts) and it definitely won't surge for it's ""surge"" capacity of 3100 watts. We've got a dual T5 fluorescent light (rated at ~50 watts total) that will trip the inverter if we're already drawing more than 200 watts on other loads. Otherwise, it's worked fine, we just have to turn off other loads before turning on our T5 light."
4,Good but not quite good enough.,"I bought this expecting it to be able to run My refrigerator. I selected this model because of the high claimed peak rating. But it will not reliably start my newer refrigerator. If I turn it off and back on it will start it every time, but if it starts on it's own, it trips out about half the time.My friend has a similar rated inverter from Sams Club that puts this one to shame when it comes to peak loads, and cost $30 less.Another minor quibble, the 10 segment voltmeter. The bottom led is red, next to bottom is yellow, all above that are green. The problem is that the lower ones never turn off as higher ones are lit. At a distance the red & yellow is more visible that the green making it look like the voltage is low when it is not. There should never be more than 2 bars lit at any time.The remote control is handy. Standard telephone jack."
1,Sadly misleading,"If you are truly inerested in a guide book to professional people in the industry, this is a book to ignore. It is entirely dated to the point of absolute frustration. I wonder where the information was gathered. It certainly was not researched. What this is is a misleading ""guide"" book in an area that shifts daily. It would have been not so bad good if the author had given some guidance on where to find current information, but apparently he thought his list of names was enough."
4,A classic album,"This album still holds up after all these years. A classic ""hardcore"" album with a unique sound that set them apart. Has a good 'Skate Rock' feel to it."
1,Product not as picture and paid too much,"What I received was some 'other' form of the product - I've not attempted to use it yet, but it may not also be a 22-16 AWG Solder Seal - we'll see. Also, for not being the product pictured (which I've used in the past w/great success), the product took too long to arrive and was over priced..."
3,"Ok, could be a lot better.","Another of those you get what you paid for. Its an ok item, the sheath is of poor quality. The blade itself is fine but attached very flimsily to the handle and shakes quite a bit whenever you swing it around."
2,disappointing,"yes, for 15 dollars this is about what you should get, although like has been mentioned the sheath was poor quality (i personally had a mass amount of saw dust residue in mine, so whenever i drew the sword it came out coated in dust) and i ended up just smashing the thing. who needs one when you can run around like a madman flailing a sword anyways? the blade on the sword started to turn from poor design also, so i modified the hilt myself and now it stays true. it also should be known that the hilt wrapping is quite poor, but that is just a personal opinion. its basically the wrap you find on the plastic ninja swords from the fair. oh also the handguard was snapped off on one side, so that was kind of odd. my friend and i double ordered and his was just fine though...none of the defects listed above."
3,Not bad but......,"Pearl Jam made the biggest mistake when they let go of Dave. His drumming was so awesome that he became one of the most respected drummers after just two albums with them. Anyway, Dave went off and made this album but I am slightly disappointed. The music here is very mellow with no real style to grasp on to. It almost feels like recorded jams. The drumming certainly doesn't stand out like it did with Pearl Jam. Despite this, track 6 and 7 contain some of Dave's awesome signature grooves! If you're a fan of Dave Abbruzzese you probably want this in your collection but his work with Pearl Jam is where it's really at. Note that Dave also plays drums on most of Stevie Salas's new CD called ""Be What It Is""."
4,For or Master Bath,LUV this Faucet! The only draw back is the handheld sprayer does NOT work very well. Very disappointed....it is hard to push the button and very little water will come out of it.Have received several compliments on it! :-)
5,Chandler at his best,"Yes Marlowe has to deal with the usual seedy world his investigations take him to yet agian, as he deals with societies richest lowlifes.But this time around he has a pair of sisters complicating things for him, and in fact one of them could be his twin sister seperated at birth who gives it to him as good as he dishes it.Chandler's style paints a vivid picture of this world for us as we watch Marlowe get himself into and out of situations as he tries to figure out what is going on and how to stop it."
2,The story held no tension for me,"On its own, this may have been an excellent book, but I just finished reading a whole series of short stories by Raymond Chandler, and one of those had a significant amount of overlapping material with ""The Big Sleep."" Some of the lines were almost virtually identical. I felt like I was just reading the long version of that short story, and as such, this novel held no tension for me. It just felt pointless. So I quickly gave up."
2,"Nope, sorry ...","I tried with this ""classic"" ... two times, then a third ... and as much as the first few chapters (the exchanges between Marlowe and the daughter) were brilliant, I couldn't finish the thing. Just couldn't. I have an issue with private eye books anyway, but this one (between the several characters and all the confusion) just didn't take hold. I thought the exchanges between Marlowe and the kid (who killed the guy who killed his boyfriend) were great also, but immediately after that scene, I folded. It's probably my issue with private eye novels anyway, but aside from the wonderful dialogue, I had a hard time swallowing and ultimately couldn't/didn't finish The Big Sleep ... i became too anxious to read what was waiting in the bin (The Leopard). This is just the 2nd novel I couldn't finish this year (2008).For my money, the James Cain novels were pure gold by comparison."
2,Not to good,"I thought the first parts of the book and until about 60 pages were left it was kind of confusing and boring. Then the story heats up a little, but the ending sucks. Hey, try it for yourself you might like it."
1,What is the point?,"Review of the book The Big Sleep by Raymond ChandlerWhat was the point, January 14, 2004Reviewer: Sleepy-head, from NowhereI know that the setting of this book was set way back in the 1920s, but why was this book so boring? Even literature back then was even at least somewhat interesting. I know that this book is a classic mystery novel, but there was really no riveting mystery involved. At least there was a little mystery involved, though. To give it some credit, Chandler's uses of similes were great in some areas, but he used them way to often. This book was very boring in my opinion. There is nothing exciting about it. It really was a 'Big Sleep.'"
4,Almost a classic,Go read it.This book was actually created from a couple of short stories that Chandler had written earlier. I recently happened to read a collection of short stories which contained two of the main stories which it borrows from. The integration of characters and plots is really amazing. Hats off to the man.
2,Tough going,"Why is it that books that are labeled as ""classics"" often seem to disappoint? That's a question that has a longer answer than I'd care to write about here, but that thought did occur to me several times while reading The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler. I'm sure high expectations have something to do with it, and the story did seem to be a winner. Philip Marlowe, a private dick from L.A. is on a black mailing case involving a millionaire and his two insane daughters.Here we find excellent prose, but a plot that is so hard to follow, I gave up about three quarters of the way through. I would have been able to keep up if I kept a notebook of all the characters (of which there are too many), and a history of what had happened thus far (too much too soon). Someone reading this for a college class may have a highlighter or two handy, and get more out of this book. However, the casual reader will find this novel tough going."
4,An Intriguing Philip Marlowe Mystery,"This is, without a doubt, one of Raymond Chandler's best mystery novels. The star of the book is Philip Marlowe, a detective hired by a millionaire in order to solve a mystery. However, Marlowe soon discovers that he has gotten himself into deeper trouble as he attempts to solve the murder of a man who leads a very secretive life. Soon afterwards, more conflicts arise while at the same time he encounters some rather interesting characters, including the two daughters of the millionaire. With numerous twists and turns throughout the entire plot, this hard-boiled piece of detective fiction will keep you reading as you follow Marlowe on his quest for answers."
4,Wealth- Porn-Murder- Missing Persons- Mental Illness,"This was my first Raymond Chandler read and I liked it. The plot was based in southern california during the late 1930's. The same time the book was written. A dying, wealthy old general is being blackmailed. He engages the services of private investigator Philip Marlowe to get to the bottom of things. It's a quick moving read of 231 pages. The story stands up well to the test of time having been originally published about seventy years ago. I think most would agree that this is an excellent introduction to the author."
5,Ahead of its time...,"Philip Marlowe is called to the sprawling mansion of the elderly and infirm (paraplegic) General Sternwood. He asks Marlowe to deal with a blackmailer named Arthur Gwynn Geiger, apparently a purveyor of rare books.The story is the classic detective story. A Femme fatale, double-crosses, intrigue, and a hero that smokes. Chandler pushes the [then] boundaries of acceptability, and has sexual and pornographic references, which adds to the dark world he created.Philip Marlow is of course the next best thing to Sherlock Holmes and all fans of murder mysteries have to read the Big Sleep before they go to bed...Relic113"
4,A little something about character development,"that a lot of 'serial' novelists would do well to learn. Here we first meet Marlowe and he is different from the way he is in later novels. He's less jaded, less cynical and thus less sarcastic. His profession hasn't taken that really big bite out of him yet, but this case puts him well on that path. We see more of the 'knight in shining armor' in Philip and it is less begrudged by him. The plot is a little scattered, but it ties up well & has the usual weird elements (THIS little sister is out there!).If this is your first Marlowe, you won't be disappointed. If you've read TLS or TLG already, you might miss that cutting edge to his observances that makes you laugh out loud (I did)."
3,"Even if you don't like mysteries, you might like this.","Although I understand the popularity of the genre, murder mysteries like The Big Sleep are not usually satisfying reading experiences for me. I frequently feel like I'm missing or overemphasizing clues: ""Does that empty coffee cup mean something?"" ""Oh, his eyebrow went up! He must have done it!""With The Big Sleep, I still experienced that feeling a bit, but the characters and voice were so strong and compelling that they more than made up for the plot twists and angles. Raymond Chandler's sentences are artistic masterpieces and clear influences on many 20th Century literary and cinematic archetypes.Marlowe is a strong individual. The other Raymond Chandler characters are like Edward Hopper's Nighthawks, searching for meaning in all the wrong places."
5,This book kept me on the edge of my seat,"I never wanted to put it down. It had everything, love, hate, murder, and blackmail. The plot may have been a little hard to follow at times because there were a lot of characters, but all in all this was a wonderful book."
5,Very special book.,"Chandler clearly loved words, metaphors, and brilliant descriptions. It's as if he just needed a vessel for his immense talent for turning a phrase that would sell and make money. Hey! Detective novels. That's it! If you want something to obscess about for a few weeks, if you like to say ""Wow, look at that sentence"", get into Raymond Chandler novels. He only wrote seven. And save your Blockbuster money, no movie could ever do this stuff justice."
3,You can almost Sense Bogart as the Lines Are Read,"Good book...story well told in the old writing style of dectective stories, very much the classical style...Shows its age, but stands the test of time...Reading it one can almost visualize,hear and feel Bogart reading the lines...from a historical standpoint, and a literary standpoint, well worth the read, just to see how much the genre has changed....good story with classical characters, good guys, bad guys and one or two fringe guys. And dolls...lots of dolls. The smoke rings are rising, there's a knock at the door...read the book!"
4,Marlowe nearly takes a fall in taunt tale of seduction and sin.,"And old codger who lives his last days in a hot-house calls in Marlow to help him. It seems he has received a blackmail threat from a person whom he has never met! Before Marlowe can hit the pavement, the codger's sexy young daughter has dragged Marlowe upstairs for a quick conference. The trail leads to a rather disreputable bookstore on Hollywood Boulevard and the trail keeps twisting as marlowe opens a can of malignant worms that he never imagined. As usual (okay, always!) with me, the plot is confusing and difficlut to follow. In fact, I admit to occasionally being bugged by Chandler's stylish techniqye of letting the reader guess who is talking, but the words Chandler uses are above reproach. I loved this book, and admired Chandler's ability to absorb the reader in the dark world of his imaginings."
4,Enjoyed it,"It was a fun read. Raymond Chandler definitely had a way with words. My favorite sentence of the book was ""Dead men are heavier than broken hearts."" I love a mystery and I enjoyed reading one of the early versions of the genre."
4,Classic Crime,"Phillip Marlowe is a character that is impossible not to like. As Chandler said, ""he is a perfect character in his world and a good enough one in ours"". If you like good literature this book will not disappoint. The style is great and its a nice change of pace from the crime books that fill the New York Time's Bestsellers list. Highly recommended."
5,Ramond Chandler's finest dectective novel,"This is the best of the best when it comes to Raymond Chandler. I am a long time fan of the detective novel and this one ranks top on my list. I read The Big Sleep along with David Lehman's reissue of ""The Perfect Murder: A Study in Detection"" and found the two books perfect companions for anyone who loves the classic WHODUNIT."
1,Racist drivel parading as history,"I am amazed that Amazon has posted a ""review"" from the right-wing reactionary racist publication entitled ""Southern Partisan"". It is small surprise that the reviewer presents a vapid, laudatory review of Mr. Henty's work. Henty was a hobbyist who read had no formal education and whose ""research"" was non-existent. Henty's works are pure fiction, based on a racist perspective from the 19th century. Homeschoolers and others who promote his works as ""history"" are doing their children a grave disservice."
3,"Good book, not a good publication","Ugh! This book is a good one about the Civil War, but sadly, it is poorly published. The lines of text are too long, the margins too narrow. It reads like a manuscript, not a book to curl up with and enjoy. There are tons of errors too. My girls are frustrated because they feel like they are editors, not students while reading the book. If you can find one in a different format, buy it instead."
2,Sometimes with Lee,I felt the language was immature and did not convey the horror and desperation of that war. It read more like a romance novel.
5,Best darn Latin dictionary on the market,"I just wanted to add another vote of confidence for this marvelous dictionary. I got through 4 years of college Latin with it, and almost never failed to find the word I was looking for. I particularly appreciate the idiomatic expressions highlighted in bold typeface, to make it easy to skim down the definition to find the one you're looking for. Its only downfall is that, as a paperback, it begins to get a bit well-thumbed, leading the serious Latinist to think, a little wistfully, that it would be nice if it came in a hardbound edition. But for a mere six bucks, you can easily afford to buy a replacement. Personally, I own two."
5,Highly recommended,"Our daughter's Latin tutor, a Classics scholar, recommended this Latin dictionary. It is excellent."
5,Follow the episode,I am a huge Stargate SG1 fan. This book helps you follow the episode and gives you a better understanding of what is happening to the characters.
4,"A comprehensive, episodic exploration","Fans of the science fiction TV series Stargate SG-1 will welcome a survey of its first eight seasons in APPROACHING THE POSSIBLE: THE WORLD OF STARGATE SG-1. Here's a comprehensive episodic exploration which will be appreciated by new viewers and old fans alike, covering everything from the background details of myth and science presented in the shows to interviews with cast, crew members and all involved. A color centerfold of photos adds some lovely close-ups of the major actors; but it's the episodic reviews that make APPROACHING THE POSSIBLE a fine survey."
4,A good comprehensive guide for Stargate SG-1,"Just one thing to make note of: this book does NOT cover the whole series. It covers seasons 1-8 only, but NOT seasons 9-10, Stargate SG-1:Continuum, and Stargate SG-1: The Ark Of Truth."
3,casio can do better,"this watch can do less of what you might expect...a casio can do much more...in low light you just cant simple see anything, the case is too big,it is a bulova made in japan ...so ...probably it is not that bad!"
1,The Mustang Story,"This account of the P-51 does not compare favorably with the dozen or so other books on the subject. The writing (other than quotes) is uninspiring and borders on boring. There are errors that should have been caught, such as the statement that the P-51D increased it's armarment to eight guns rather than six. The quality of the paper is only fair and the vast majority of the photographs have been seen before. If you are looking for a comprehensive history of the P-51 Mustang, look elsewhere."
2,Poor Audio,I'll give two stars because the audio was so bad that I had to crank up the volume on my TV to the highest point and I still could not make heads or tails what the people were saying! What a rip off! Although I liked the idea of the movie in dealing with good and evil. I understand that how things were back then with no big budget for making the movie. The blacks had to use what was given them and they made history! I will still invest in these hard to find films.
4,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.,"I had to watch this movie twice before I got what was going on. There aren't any plots, not that I could spot. (A little rhyme there) Anyway, I only liked one scene, and that was when two Afro American guys were walking out in the woods with a laundry and dry cleaner owner who was playing a role of a chinese man. He was so aweful at it that it would make you laugh out loud. The two Afro American guys were just as funny. The actors of this 1940 film, were bad actors, but the story was so fake that it was hilarious. If you want a good laugh, this is the movie."
1,Not worth it,"My husband used this book to prepare for the Praxis II in business. It confused him more than anything else and made him feel like he would fail when he was initially confident. Some of the practice questions were incomprehensible and he was getting about 50% wrong on the practice quizzes the night before the Praxis, but ended up acing the real test (nearly perfect score). Stick with the official ETS book!"
1,Don't get ripped off,"This is by far the worst bootleg I have had the misfortune of listening to. And I collect bootlegs! I only gave it 1 star because they don't have zero star ratings.And I do believe this is a bootleg release. I highly doubt Perry and Co. are getting their percentages out of the sale of this thing.The audio quality is POOR. Not just poor, but the WORST. The vocals are unintelligible. The guitar solos are only audible when Dave hits a high note and it cuts through the garbled noise.The songs are not rare either. The ""soundcheck"" half of the disc is basically the band playing Had A Dad, but it's Had A Dad with very bad track markers.I think the individuals responsible for selling this #1 do not know the songs, #2 do not know Jane's Addiction, and #3 don't care who gets ripped off from buying it."
3,Watch out!,"This CD does have some rare stuff on it. However, the source is a poor audience recording. This disc is also very short -- about 25 minutes.For hardcore Jane's fans, the soundcheck stuff is kind of interesting. (one of the segments includes a reference to Zep's When the Levee Breaks)."
4,don't buy the Loyola classics edition,"If you want to order this, I'd steer away from the ""Loyola"" classics edition.It's far fancier (and thicker) than you need. With large print and generous margins, the book ends up being quite thick.There was no reason for this. I think they just did it to make the the book look thicker and thus charge you more.I wish I had just gone with the no-frills paperback version. No, this one has frills."
3,"I love St. Francis, and I love Kazantzakis... but didn't love this book","I love the story of St. Francis, and I loved Kazantzakis' excellent Last Temptation of Christ, but this novel fell short of my expectations. In my reading, St. Francis comes across as profoundly unlikeable, a wildly misogynistic and selfish attention-getter. Kazantzakis does capture St. Francis' affinity with the animal world well, but I found his St. Francis to be less than saintly throughout most of the book. I think it's still worth reading, as an individual's modern hagiography, but it pales in comparison to the genius of Last Temptation."
1,Dry and Disappointing,"I had to do a rare book search for this book and when it came I couldn't wait to dive in. But my enthusiasm quickly subsided into utter boredom. Maybe the author was there and maybe some consider this a WW2 classic but I found it very dry reading and very easy to put down. Besides that fact, it is very biased for Montgomery and when there was blame to place it usually and many times unfairly went to the Americans. For a good history of the War in Normandy try Keegans' 'six armies' or one of the individual's histories like 'roll me over' or 'if you survive' and leave this book where it belongs...in a rare book store."
1,Absolute garbage!,Length:: 1:39 MinsThis is just a quick review on this sword. The whole sword was a complete mess. The blade was not even the right shape as shown in the picture and everything looked as though it had been slapped together with metal scraps.
4,An excellent collector's item,The sword is extremely lightweight. It is very easy to use and is aesthetically pleasing to the eye. I absolutely love it. there is nothing bad to say about it
5,My Favorite Sword,"This is a great battle-ready sword. Well-balanced, sturdy, sharp... comes with a great leather sheath. It feels great in one hand. Light enough to swing around, heavy enough to cut into someone."
3,Body Spray,"I bought this product because I am in love with the Bobbi Brown Beach fragrance (which smells like your at the beach as in its name). This has the same smell which I really liked. This product is oily and it did not sink into my skin which I did not like. Its good for laying on the beach or by the pool but that is it. It did leave a nice shimmer to my skin but any oil based product would do that. If you are buying this just for the fragrance like I did, skip it. I was not impressed with this product. But I still love the Bobbi Brown line."
5,Work Great. Great price.,"I have ordered these filters several times now. They work great, and I have never had a problem with my order."
5,Think Of Bill Laswell As Barry White,"This album is his Love Unlimited Orchestra. I mean that in a good way. If you own any or all of the albums these ""reconfigurations"" are based upon, this is just a really cool way to revisit them in not such an edgy manner. But don't worry, they haven't had the life sucked out of them, or been dumbed-down. This is Ambient with balls, if you will."
3,Slightly new-agey but still good,"I loved this album when I had it on cassette; some reviewers rag on Bill Laswell-- at Aquarius Records, they basically say of his work ""It's Laswell; his 5,477th dub album with 9,478 more to come"". But I like him. So I guess I like the cheese. It's got nice fragments here and there and if I remember correctly, this was released before this sound became so cliche. It was worth my $3 or whatever I paid to get this on CD."
5,Hidden Hand and its sequel,"My sister in law encouraged me to get the Kindle, and also to be sure to read Hidden Hand and its sequel. She was right on all counts. I really liked Cap's spunk, moral compass, and compassion. The plot was detailed but never confusing. I'd say EDEN Southworth was a very good spokesperson for women's dignity, while avoiding the traps of later feminist writers. Thanks for putting the books in Kindle format -- and for making them available free of charge!"
5,I love antique books such as this!,"Southworth is an excellent storyteller! She holds your interest throughout her stories. Something I enjoy doing while reading these older books is to catch concerns, thoughts and phrases from that era...they have carried through to today."
5,I liked it,"entertaining, I had to continue reading until i got to the end. made me laugh and enjoyed the humor in the book."
5,Hold your breath at every turn of the page........,"A page turner and a breath holder! Wow! Wish books nowadays were written more like this one. I particularly like the morality presented. There are only 3 books I know of by this author, how sad!"
4,To be or not,"In his earliest novels (this was his first), Barth dealt with nihilism, but with a grin. This book is all about how a character named Todd chose a day in 1937 to commit suicide and then came to the conclusion, since life is so meaningless, so is death: might as well go on living. Barth writes in an interesting tone and style - not straight narrative. He also shows great authority, which is unusual in a first novel."
5,Deliciously Sexy...,"This is an extremely hot collection of 27 stories, featuring themes like spanking, voyeurism, girls with girls, sex clubs, and more. My favorite pieces were N.T. Morley's ""Memorandum,"" a white-hot inner-office memo, ""California King,"" by Jesse Nelson, which is a story about the life and time's of a mattress, and Zero Sum Game, by Alex Mendra, with a dom woman and a sub man. In the Empire of Lust by Maxim Jakubowski is a hot office fantasy and Outing Isolde by Ann Blakely is a dom woman, sub man, sub woman threesome. There is plenty of kink in this book, but even more important, the stories are all very well written!"
2,Rather dull,"This book is pretty dull for something ""naughty"" - lots of old hat ideas, and nothing's risque in it. A couple of good writers, and the rest is quite forgettable. Avoid"
2,Review,"The book was okay, bit disappointing, i liked the font size and the size of the book. Won't buy it again that particular one something flew out of it thought someone use it."
2,Not worth it!,I thought the stories in this book were boring. I was expecting better from Allison Tyler. Save your money and spend it on the His and Hers books.
4,Not my cup of tea exactly,"I must admit I didn't read the whole book. Just a story here, story there. The stories were a bit too much ""reading"" I like stories 2 pages long that get to the action..But, thats what you should expect when the erotica you read is from the adult shop and not really erotica at all, but..porn in words.Anyways, this book seemed a little too wordy for me. A great book otherwise."
4,Hollywood HR 1000 Bike Rack,Nice product. Poor instructions. Box included extra parts and parts that are not shown or listed on instructions.
4,"Great Rack, but..........","This rack is a very nice, well built rack and works as advertised! I did not give it 5 stars because I didn't realize before I bought it, that it CAN NOT be used behind a fifth-wheel or any trailer for that matter. That was the first thing printed in the installation instructions. I called the company and they said the bouncing of the trailer will crack the rack mount. This would not have been a deal breaker but it would have been nice to know this before buying as I had intended to mount this on a trailer. Hopefully this review will help someone else!"
3,Bike Rack,"The rack tends to rock side to side when the car is moving. It's not going to come loose, it's just distracting to see in the rearview mirror. I have driven hundreds of miles with two bikes on it and have not lost one yet!"
1,Not fit Class 1 hitch of 1 Inch receiver,"My car has a U-haul Class 1 hitch of 1 1/4 Inch receiver, but the pinhole of this product does not align with the pinhole of the receiver because there is a stopper inside the receiver. This may fit a Class 2 hitch with 1 1/4 or 2 Inch receiver, but not Class 1."
3,Not easy on easy off,"One caution to potential buyers of this rack: If you need to install/remove the rack frequently, for example, due to garage space, you need to unscrew the bolt that holds the rack to the hitch. This is under the car and thus tedious to do. Also, to allow sufficient room for the bolt with security lock, I had to cut a wider opening in the fascia on my hitch. Although most reviewers found this rack easy to assemble, on mine the fittings weren't as smooth as I had expected and it took some effort to work the pins until they loosened sufficiently. Once installed, the rack seems to work well. This is my first rack, so the on and off hassle may be typical."
5,Hollywood bike rack,Item was exactly as described. Checked out price at bike store and it was $299.00 without tax. Amazon price was $195 total with free shipping. Great Buy and very happy I check out Amazon!!!!!!!!!!!
4,a solid buy,"I had searched a number of hitch mount racks and first purchased a Yakima highlight from rei. The rack was a disaster, built for three bikes but only holding two with great difficulty. It was also a struggle to get the bikes on and off. After reading countless reviews on countless sights, I decided to try the Hollywood HR 1000. It's been a pleasure so far. Easy on and off and I like that the rack is built to hover above the lower hitch mount providing extra clearance. The one downside is that you need to unbolt the rack every time you want to take it off -- not a long process, but a more efficient system would be helpful. All in all a very good buy, especially for the price."
5,great rack,"Used this bike rack for the first time two weeks ago. After an easy set up and adjustment to fit our bikes, we went to northern Minnesota to ride some trails with friends. The bikes traveled nicely with hardly a wiggle. The rack makes for very easy loading and unloading. I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase. My friend was so impressed with it that he ordered one the following Monday. Shipping on this item only took two or three days. Very pleased *****"
5,"Heavy, but works well","This rack is well-engineered and well-made.Mostly made from steel, it is somewhat heavy...but still easily handled by one person.The steel gives it strength and rigidity of course.Bikes are held securely with virtually no chance of getting scratched or damaged.I am happy with my purchase and can definitely recommend it."
4,Very usefull and convinient product,"Very quiet and stable, easy to use, but doesn't have any security device: lack or cable, to protect bikes and rack from stealing"
3,fighting ace freaking kicked asssssss,"Fighting ace------I was not expecting much after just watching instant kung fu man, but the action revolves completely around John Liu in this one, so watch out. JOHN LIU ACTUALLY USES BOTH LEGS IN THIS ONE. HE CAN'T WHIP EM BACK AND FORTH LIKE THE GREAT SILVER FOX DOES, BUT IT REALLY COOL TO ACTUALLY SEE HIM USE BOTH OF THEM.36 crazy stupid fists-JACKIE CHAN MAKES NO APPEARENCE IN THIS. This movie is obviously one of jackies first efforts as the ""matrial arts director""(if he even was). The action REALLY sucks, so the only reason I would tell you to watch this movie is for that girl who was tiger's(wei pei) hooker in young master, she has a revealing scene, AND MAN SHE HAS SOMETHING NICE TO SHOW. So if both of these movies really are on this double pack then freaking buy it!!!!!Overall a 4/5 for fighting ace and a 2/5 for the non jackie movie. Oh yeah, the music from secret rivals blasts away in fighting ace too, sweet."
2,Poorly designed grill,"I liked the LOOK of this fan, but unfortunately it has to go back. You get to the end of the assembly and then you find that the front grill cover won't attach to the back. After struggling with the cheap plastic rim that is supposed to lock onto the back grill for about 30 minutes I gave up! Even if there's a chance you might get it to fit, good luck next time if you need to clean it or if the grill bends just the slightest bit you'll likely never get it re-attached. Did Holmes test this design? It's NOT functional and it flat-out doesn't work!"
4,it's still in print!,"Grandmaster Yates has put together a superb reference containing all the Taekwon Do forms in an easy to read format. It's a valuable tool for the Taekwon Do student as well as for the black belt instructor. (It's not as detailed as Grandmaster Jhoon Rhee's 5-volume series, but it gives the same basic information for a lot less money -- and a lot less shelf space.) I highly recommend it. This excellent book is still in print at paladin-press.com.ISBN: 0873644921Publisher code: TKDS2"
5,The earth as physics,"I have to declare interest on this one. Prof Frank Stacey (retired now) was my lecturer in Earth Physics at U of Q in the late 60s. I have the 1st edition of his book. The treatment is at a fairly advanced level and you do need a good grasp of the maths to follow his arguments in detail. The rewards are immense - a better understanding of the dynamic earth, tectonics, earth magnetism and the seismic earth. I've not seen the 1992 edition - tempting!"
4,Helpful Hints for Drawing & Sketching,This book has lots of information & was very helpful. It gives lots of helpful hints along with diagrams & examples. I would recommend it for anyone who is seriously considering drawing or just improving the skills they already have.
5,Excellent resource,This is an excellent resource for beginning pencil drawers. I refer to it consistently and I highly recommend it. Definitely worth the money.
4,Good starting fundamentals,"I like this book as it covers most of the basic topics in pencil drawing. As compared to other books for beginners, this book gives sufficient guidelines and examples. The only concern I have is that the examples are not very ""real"", not ""live"" enough. After all, I would recommend this book to beginners in pencil drawing."
1,"Lack of instruction, not good for self learning.","I don't really understand why this book got so many good reviews.Personally, I wouldnt recommend it to a beginner, for the simple reason that it lacks step by step instructions, it only features 1 to 3 pictures per examples, which IMHO is insufficient for self learning shading techniques, the section on perspective is extremely brief and not very helpful.If you want to learn to draw, try instead the Betty Edwards workbook, and for shading techniques and creating texture, try the lifelike texture in pencil by Lee Hammond, which has more detailed instructions.Btw, if you don't believe my review, check this book out of the library, you'll see for yourself what I mean."
1,Not a helpful drawing book.,"Pencil Drawing Techniques by David Lewis is not really a helpful book for beginners and I support the other 1 star review. This book is simply an editor's collection of sections by various artists that might have been more effective in their own book settings. For instance, the section titled drawing animals might more accurately be titled drawings of animals because very little instruction is done for ""how"" to draw them. Some animals simply are presented as finished drawings with no step by step drawings at all.I already had several books by artists included here, and I would rather buy the original than excerpts. I would not have bought this book had I known its composition and will return it."
2,Mothballs?,"This book arrived in very good condition but I haven't been able to read it yet. I have been airing it out since I received it. I hope I can bear to review it in the future, it absolutely reeks of MOTHBALLS! It is a terrible, toxic odor."
3,Not for the faint of heart.,"This movie was an alright movie. If you are in the mood for something that is way out in left field, then give this one a try. The subject matter is very shocking. The first ten minutes of this movie are the most shocking.I watched the movie for Alex O'Loughlin. He helped write it and also acts in it. His character is crazy but has a lot of depth. He plays his character very well. The other main male character is quite weak but Alex O'Loughlin's character kind of makes up for him.If you have a strong stomach, then give the movie a try. I recommend you watch it twice. Watch it once to get over the shock, then watch it again to better understand to story. If you have a weak stomach this movie isn't for you."
4,Great Movie Experience-But Different,"If you love indie type films and love Alex O'Loughlin's acting you will enjoy this different film. It can be disturbing in a number of ways because of the unusual subject matter, but if you can get past all that and watch the characters develope and try to understand that there is very little differences between the two main characters you will love it, in an odd way! I believe Alex is one of the best new actors emerging on the scene today and he really makes you believe he is Michael and he owns the screen when he is on it!...."
2,For the love of blubber,"If truly obese women and the men who feed them are your thing, this deliberately exploitive raunch film will send you running for more mashed potatoes. Feed wasn't meant (I think) to be taken seriously. An Aussie cop is determined to track down what appears to be an Internet fetish killer in the U.S. He does. We learn a lot about strange love, unforced feeding and human blubber. Alex O'Loughlin, who wrote and stars, and the fat suit worn by the lead actress do the best acting."
2,ditto had potential but didnt work,Really 1star but a 2 star for originality. I tried to stick this one out hoping it would snowball but it is too loose and baggy. Could not get involved with any of the characters. Then footage of obscene obesity started to make my stomach squirm.
2,FEED ME.,Pretty weird and definitely a different concept. It was pretty disturbing. Worth a watch. Same three guys that were in Man-Thing.
4,Food for discussion,"This is a shocking movie, but definitely worth seeing if you want material for discussion on what film is or should be about and what its purposes can or should be."
4,Boy's perversions,Hardly entertaining story of boy's childhood perversions leading to a mental state of a serial murderer making living on establishing a gambling site where death dates of obese people fed to death are stakes.It might be watched once to broaden knowledge of dangers surrounding.
2,The Grossest Film Ever,"The review on the cover of the DVD tells you that it is the grossest film the reviewer has ever seen. I totally agree even though I only got about 7 minutes into the film and had to shut it off. I have not finished watching it and doubt if I will ever finish it. I think the world of Alex O'Loughlin and love all his other works but this is one film I will pass on and relook at Alex in ""The Oyster Farmer"" a wonderful film that I would recommend to any Alex O'Loughlin fan."
3,Alex O'Loughlin is brilliant,"The acting in this movie is great, particularly Alex's. Not something I'd normally watch but glad I did.I won't go into detail as its already been written but I do agree with other comments here, we seem to miss a great deal of really good films/TV, its a shame so much rubbish makes it on to our screens."
4,WOW,"if you like sick twist people and fat women this is the one. i got this one for both reasons but i got to tell you it's alot more than you think it is if you never seen it, but its still a good movie..."
4,Must See For Alex O'Loughlin Fans,"I am a big movie buff and like to watch all types from horror to period films, however I don't think I would have purchased Feed if not for Alex O'Loughlin. I am a big fan and once again he does not dissapoint. Although the movie is disturbing on many levels it stays with you and ultimately makes you think about real love and beauty. I recommend this movie for Alex fans and for those who like movies that make you think."
1,FEED moivie,"I so love the actor Alex O'Loughlin that I bought this movie thinking Feed it would be good. Well, teach me to read things more. I was shocked and as much as I loved Alex in Moonlight series.. not in this! This movie is what I call mild porn and it's gross. I watched it and I hated it all. Forcing fat people to eat while tied to bed is wrong. Making them so fat they die is evil. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!!!!"
2,Inconsistent Attempt at Gross-out Shocker,"Americans are fat, and the whole world knows it. The trouble is, we sometimes forget about our own obesity. Thats what strikes me about FEED. It's an interesting concept, and I'm honestly surprised that I haven't seen more films like this one.In a nutshell, its an attempt to gross-/shock the viewer, that doesn't necessarily fall short, it just does not seem all that believable. The extreme gluttony and sex doesnt maintain the viewer's interest and there are times when you must throw reality out the window altogether.All in all, its a decent RENTAL. I just cannot help but feel that it could have been done better."
2,bad move,"If this is the same Barnyard Ballers as the band that pened ""turned my liquer store into a church"" back inthe mid 90s on their original release than it is a serious step down. Look for earlier material."
1,KitchenAid stand mixer cover is misrepresented.,"In the product's title, it says, ""Fits all KitchenAid stand mixers"". This is not true. I purchased a 600 professional series model which is almost 17 inches high with a list price of $499 and KitchenAid has the nerve to send this piece of garbage that leaves the entire base of the unit exposed. What a disappointment! After spending quite a bit of money on the mixer and attachments, I was excited about my new purchase until I saw what they sent as a cover. It looks attractive and is well made, but it doesn't come close to fitting the professional series mixer. One would think that a mixer of this quality and price would at least have a cover that fits."
1,NOT the real thing...,"My mistake was assuming this product is the KitchenAid cover made by KitchenAid. The picture shows a mixer cover very similar to the real thing, down to what looks like the ""KitchenAid"" tag on the left. Very misleading. Instead I received a generic cover made with poor quality materials (no ""KitchenAid"" tag sadly to say). The pocket is so flimsy and thin that if I put my accessories in it, I doubt it will carry its weight because the pocket will just rip off eventually. The ""heavyweight quilted cotton"" as advertised is not so heavyweight, it's more like a quilted linen cotton with very thin padding. The real KitchenAid cover is actually made with a heavyweight quilted cotton that feels like canvas and it has a sturdy pocket (I have one). Needless to say, this product is going back to where it came from. Lesson learned. You get what you paid for. So disappointed."
1,Not the right size,"Says it fits ""all"" Kitchenaide mixers but not so. If you buy (as we did) a Kitchenaide mixer that has the bowl that can be raised while still in the mixer, it is about 2"" too short. But it is too inexpensive to send back so I think I'll use it for a toaster. :)"
1,Beware! Too short!,"This cover is too short to fit my Kitchen Aid mixer by about 3-4 inches.Very nice about it when I complained-offered to return my money and let me keep the cover, but I had already returned it by that time."
1,MISREPRESENTED,"The ad cearly represents this mixer as BY KITCHENAID~ it is not! it came with no packaging, no tags, not brand name, and doesnt even fit the mixer. MAD MAD MAD"
2,I suppose its my own fault,"While looking for a cover, I think I had decided on the real kitchen aid cover and then got mixed up and bought this one (the picture is similar), not realizing it wasn't the one I had chosen.After receiving it, I was reading the reviews that talked about it being too short, which interested me because mine was too long and it just looked floppy. Apparently I had to put the bowl on it to add more girth, which took care of the extra inches, but now it is unsymmetrical- it bulges out in the front and sags in at the back, which bothers me more than it should.You get what you pay for, and I wish I had paid the extra five bucks for the brand name one."
4,Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer Cover,"The cover is very high quality and I like the pocket where you can store the manual. My only complaint is that I cannot put my clear splash guard in place and then use the cover, so I will have to store that somewhere else."
1,Too Small,"This item would have been nice for an appropriate size mixer. The description stated it fits all size KitchenAid mixers, which is not the case. I have a 6-quart mixer and found this cover to be too small. I therefore had to return it. If you own a 6-quart mixer, make sure the cover's information states that it fits a 6 -QUART mixer!"
1,mixer cover,"cover too short for mixer, a total rip off. product should have been tried on mixer be fore being offered for sale"
3,doesn't fit as well,does not fit as well as the kitchen aid mixer cover and is not as heavy but the price was lower than the kitchen aid so it just depends on what is most important to you.
4,It works!,"The mixer cover has worked well for me. It isn't flashy, but it fits over the entire mixer. I also like that it's washable."
4,"Nice product, fits great!","Cover fits my kitchenAid mixer great. I have the tilt head mixer and it is a perfect fit. It looks nice and clean and keeps the mixer and bowl ready to use. I rated it a 4 instead of five because the cover is not top quality and I am not sure how it will wash up...we'll see. For under twenty bucks, I am pleased."
5,The best Prelude and Violin Sonata ever recorded !,"The impeccable phrasing , intonation and vibrato of David Oistrakh joins with the dynamic imagination and raptrure of his fellow friend Sviatoslav Richter to produce to my mind the most poignant , haunting and colossal version of this Sonata which sounds far from being romantic in its whole conception . It sounds dramatic and that vision confers it the most vibrant and passionate Frank Sonata for Violin I have heard ever .and by the way if this performing were not enough for your requirements , please prepare to listen one of the definitive version of this piece .Sviatoslav Richter gives a towering performance plenty of this solemn and introspective spirit this work demands . So try to get as soon as you can this golden album .Historical recordings with superlative artists !"
2,Unfortunately quality not as represented,Disappointed to receive this fabulous book in pretty bad shape; have already had to tape all pages together to just keep the book together. Luckily my 5 year old absolutely loves the book and doesn't care what it looks like.
4,Another good one,Fast becoming a fan of Mr. Parker. Story keeps a quick pace. Subtle humor and dialog that is fast moving keeps things interesting.
4,"""Matron Head"" by Anita Yingling appeals to readers of suspense, history and romance,","For those who love to read mystery. history, suspense, and romance, ""Matron Head"" by Anita Yingling has it all.The characters are believable. the settmgs are colorfully described,. the parallel plots are fascinating and the suspense, espcially in the final chapters, is riveting. It is obvious that a great deal of research went into this novel. It is an excellent read and would make a fine gift."
4,Good Spenser Novel,"This is a good Spenser novel. It has good lines and a good plot. I'm impressed with how Parker writes of Spenser's love for Susan. It is refreshing!The book deals with murder, cocaine, trafficking, crooked cops, adultery - - it's all there. Great read for plane or beach."
1,An insult to any intelligent reader,"I found this book to have little redeeming value. The dialog is particularly crude and the ""detective"" work is simplistic."
4,ENTERTAINING PARKER STYLE,I read all of PARKER'S books & enjoy them all. Ilove the short chapters & subtle humor. I knew Robert & his books remind me of him.
3,Average,"I was expecting this to be one kick ass album, but I was a little let-down. This CD is merely average compared to some of the more interesting artists this year (Mindless Faith, Imperative Reaction, Seabound, Front Line Assembly... To name a few). While there are a few stand outs on here.. For the most part its not anything you haven't heard before.They thank NIN in the booklet... But I find it hard to believe Trent Reznor had anything to do with helping them."
2,Disappointment,"My expectations were probably too high but I'm strongly disappointed with this album. Main reason is different (and much worse imo) female singer. Her vocals are either annoying or boring..depends on song. Reminds me of Snake River Conspiracy singer, and that's not good.But there are still few good songs on here (haven, epiphany...)Viral Extinction is still the best so far..."
4,Lightning,"The 2GB Lexar Lightning Jump drive is exactly that, Lightning fast. The transfer rate is the quickest of any flash memory device that I have used. It is in an attractive chrome casing that inconveniently remains attached to your key chain while you are using the drive. Comparatively, I have a Lexar 512MB ""Sport"" Jump drive that is removeable from a rubber strap. With the Sport Jump Drive you can insert it into your computer free of a cumbersome keychain making it much more convenient to use. Ideally, I would like to combine the capacity and speed of the Lexar Lightning with the user friendly convenience of the Lexar Sport."
5,Figure Drawing book,The original book was printed in 1943 and has just been reprinted last year. It certainly remains one of the most outstanding books on figure drawing.
4,My Art Library,"Another great selection that was added to my library of art books. At 70 years plus, I'm still going to school to increase my knowledge.This book has helped me in my figure drawing class which in turn is helping me prepare for my next semesters class on sculpting thehuman figure in clay.Great reference book and well worth the price."
5,Simply: WOW!,"What a great book. I read somewhere this book is the ultimate authority on figure drawing. I was intrigued so I bought it, since I need to learn how to draw people.When I got the package, I was already expecting ""the ultimate authority"" in terms of content. I was definitely not disappointed, but more so, the book blew me away! Andrew Loomis was absolutely amazing! The book teaches you everything you need to draw people, including skeletal structure and muscles! Well written, too.The only thing this book does not focus on enough is the face and hands, but there's another book devoted to that by Loomis. I'm still waiting for that one to be released... somewhere in October 2011, if I remember correctly.Two thumbs up!"
5,"Fantastic resource, Mr. Loomis is a great teacher.","A friend of mine at work swears by this, and we've been working with this book together for several weeks now, giving ourselves homework assignments and copying the drawings.Andrew Loomis was truly a master of figure drawing, but more importantly, he was a fantastic teacher. I've bought many books on drawing, from many talented artists, but as it turns out, that's not all that it takes to be a good teacher. Mr. Loomis is clear and concise with his language. His step-by-step approach is simple, easy to understand, and well-illustrated.I am an advanced artist in many respects, but reading this book is refreshing, and has proven very helpful in re-structuring and rebuilding my figure-drawing fundamentals. Highly recommend it."
5,Best book to get you started,"If you are a beginner, like myself, who wants to be able to draw humans from scratch without reference (or tracing) this is the book. Its much more then just figure drawing, it deals a great deal with how work should be approached, right attitude, and sets you in a right direction. Section on perspective is simply the best i have seen. As far as i hear every comic book pro recommends it as a must. Its worth every single penny."
2,some one is making money,"some one is making money but not andrew loomis. these books came out in 1943. they are the property of the estate of... all the faces images are of that period. there being only one color of people in the usofa at the time, well as per these books. everything is so dated."
5,About time!,"Well it's about time someone re-released this classic! I've hoarded my beaten-up library book sale copy for decades. Simply put, Loomis' books (including the re-release of Drawing the Head and Hands) are some of the best drawing books ever published.Loomis may not be a common name to artists these days, but he greatly influenced generations of artists from the 1940's to the present. Comic book fans need only look at the works of Steve Rude and Alex Ross to see what I mean.Coupled with Loomis' friendly approach to teaching the subject matter and his gorgeous illustration style, this is a purchase well worth making!Now if only Titan would re-release Creative Illustration, his seminal work..."
5,Must have for any artist,"I aquired mine thru an exboyfriends great aunt that was an artist. (7th printing Jan. 1945) This is the book that helped me out more than any other book I could have bought... I highly recommend it, if you can find reprints, I suggest getting one!"
3,Ho Hum,The makers of EYEBORGS have to be congratulated that they make no attempts to hide that they are presenting a B-Movie. It's a very typical killer robots story. Adrian Paul turns in the best performance possible under B-Movie restrictions of a less than edge-of-your-seat script. The cheese factor is pretty high.
2,"Low Budget, Low Quality","I am not saying to avoid watching it.But this is made for TV, low budget quality, with an idiotic plot.At least it is free on Prime."
2,Thinly veiled Libertarian Propaganda,"Moderately entertaining dystopian sci-fi flick with a decent b-list cast, but seriously, it's just libertarian propaganda.I'm amazed I finished it really."
3,"A little like ""1984""",It reminded me of “1984”. The action wasn’t great and neither was the dialogue but I had fun watching it.
3,"Is That Killer Robot's Grandpa in Disney's ""Blackhole"" ?","The storyline is pretty good but the script needed a bit more work. The cgi had a few flaws (i.e. when the killer robots entered the secret passage)and could learn a few things from SyFy's ""Sanctuary"" computer modellers. The background masking left much to be desired. But after all is said and done, I'd give it a ""B"" Movie ""B minus"". Mainly because I found myself wondering if it could be a series or have a sequel."
3,Ok and Enjoyable,"Eyeborgs was about a 7 on a scale of 1-10, in my opinion. I enjoyed watching Eyeborgs, (The Bourne Identity, Killers, and Star Trek, (the newer one), are what I consider top-tier, 10-type stuff). Please check out my all time favorite TV series ""Misfits"" online at hulu."
3,Keep Watching The Eyes!,"B-borg movie? Well, maybe a C+. I caught this during one of my bachelor weeks when there was no one here to stop me from watching cheap sci-fi flicks. Eyeborg is an amazingly cheap movie...except that it's actually quite good in terms of message and how much they did with some sfx and a few twists on the robo-apocalypse storyline."
4,An excellent B movie,This is a great b movie. It's a bit political and a little gory but the cgi is extremely well done and the story doesn't drag at all. Very watchable and definitely worth owning if you like schlocky b movies.
2,it's a made for TV movie,"I watched this the other day - I wouldn't rank it as a big screen movie, but more like a made for TV movie. Try to find it on TV rather than pay for a DVD. Not that good, I wouldn't have even kept watching it, but already saw it on here and it got good reviews. I would have passed on it otherwise. I expected a lot more."
1,eyeborg,my copy dont work sending back then ill report on the movie and to those dont like my review shut up
4,WORTH IT TO SEE ADRIAN PAUL,"IM A BIG ADRIAN PAUL FAN. I THINK HE WOULD MAKE AN EXCELLENT JAMES BOND. HE HAS HAD SOME ODD CHOICES FOR STARRING ROLES SINCE THE HIGHLANDER. THIS ONE IS IN THE MIDDLE. IT WASNT A POOR CHOICE, NOR A GREAT ONE. THE EFFECTS WERE PRETTY GOOD FOR A MOVIE OF ITS BUDGET, BUT THE STORY COULD HAVE BEEN MORE COMPELLING. IN THE END, IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WOW EFFECTS AND TOP SHELF SCI-FI... THIS AINT IT. IF YOU WANNA SEE ADRIAN PAUL IN A MOVIE OF C+ TO B QUALITY BECAUSE YOU'RE A FAN OF HIS... THEN THIS IS FOR YOU. IT MAY SOUND A BIT WEIRD, BUT THIS SHOW HAS THE FEELING OF BEING PART 2. LIKE THE MOVIE "" EYEBORGS "" STARRING ADRIAN PAUL WAS THIS REALLY GREAT MOVIE, AND THIS WAS A SO-SO FOLLOW UP OR PART 2. IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN..."
2,R-rated show,"I'm a PG/PG-13 viewer. This show had some interesting ideas, although it was a little dark. The plot was too obvious. I disliked the movie because of wanton violence, dignified anarchy, and heroization of a psychopath martyr. When that degraded to sexuality and nudity, I turned it off. I don't know how it ended, but I gave it 2 stars because the show had some moments of decent acting and realistic eyeborg animation."
1,Bluray quality lacking,Ripoff! The copy I received from Amazon will not play on my Sony Bluray player. I believe others have reported the same issue. There seems to be manufacturing issue with the disks that Amazon continues to sell. I wish I could review the movie for you but unless Amazon sends a replacement that works that will not happen.
5,"robust design, industrial strength","I did an internet search looking for the perfect oyster knife. I ordered this one and was not disappointed. The blade is made of thick high carbon steel, pointy and stiff enough to pry the shell open without bending. The handle is molded to the blade in such a way as to prevent dirt from getting between the two for sanitary cleaning. The handle is big enough for a sturdy grip, and it has a rough texture so your hand won't slip when wet. The length of the blade is perfect for slipping inside the shell to cut the muscle once the hinge is pried open. It's made in the USA, too! If you're looking for a real working tool for a reasonable price, I don't think you'll beat it."
4,Great book,This was the required text book for a class in musical theater in college. I found it informative but lacked many details that I would have like to have known.
2,cheap lock,"I regret my decision of buying this. I was looking for a Schlage, but the quality is totally different as Dexter was just purchased by Schlage.Worse, I can't find an easy way to re-key this lock. I've got a Schlage re-key kit but found out Dexter, like Defiant, is very hard to do."
1,"Cheap design, more difficult to rekey",So far I've found the more common Schalge locks for the home are not on even a reasonable end of cylinder designs. This one comes with a manual for JD60/JD62 but the rekey manual from Schlage does not reflect this lock for these model numbers. This lock uses a very cheap looks to be one time use retainer for the tailpiece forcing you to forget a follower and just reinsert top springs and pins on the way back together. I'm no expert but there is a much nicer design for this I've seen on other Schlages. Very dissappointed in this product considering the brand.
2,Decent pre-trip read but not worth taking with you,"This book has solid information and is well-written but that doesn't keep it from being BORING! The only pictures provided are in a few pages at the front of the book. The maps are not good enough to travel with. It makes a decent pre-trip read (or to at least browse through when planning your trip). However, don't plan on traveling with this book. The National Geographic or Eyewitness Travel Guides are far better. The best of the best are the Rick Steves travel books which do not have pictures either but are updated every single year with new hotel and restaurant information plus great maps."
5,This stuff is fantastic,"This is a great soup base, and I think it's a better used as a base than stand-alone as a finished product. Consider making a soup with shrimp, fish balls, vegetables, and then serving it over noodles. A fair price would be $3.00 per bottle, however."
5,Great hot sauce for Chinese dishes!,"My husband is Chinese and loves hot sauce, so I ordered this for him. He loves it! It's authentic!"
3,Too sweet for me,It is not hot enough but too sweet and sour for me. It also contains addictive that I do not like.
4,Nice translation,"It is not easy to translate poetry into poetry. It's bad enough simply trying to translate to prose. Ms. Terry does an excellent job. I read Le Roman de Renart in French while I was studying in France. Years later, I came across this translation.It is fascinating the way the original storytellers portrayed Renart. He is a completely hateful creature. Yet reading about him is fun. It's similar to how I feel about stories of Loki or Coyote. Renart is closer to Loki than to Coyote, despite the canine ancestry. He is more than simply a trickster: he is malevolent.If you have an interest in ancient folktales, you mustn't miss the story of Renart. This translation is different from any other I've read. The introduction gives a good perspective on the times when the stories were hatched."
1,Info is often dead wrong.,"I have a 1984 Accord, and this book has been a vale of tears for me. Pictures and diagrams are often wrong, and the repair procedures can ruin your day. My mechanic suggested throwing it in the trash and shelling out the $90 for the factory shop manual and electric wiring reference, and I'm doing just that. The price difference is trivial compared to lost time or trips to the repair shop that Haynes will cause you."
1,fuse box,"the layout of the fuse box is completely different on my 1985 honda accord, book is very poor, still can't find the fuel pump relay"
3,Could have done better.,Overall this book is very superficial. If you need more indepth information-there are no cross-references. They backout of indepth information by telling the reader that the subject-at-hand exceeds the scope of the manual. No further reference is provided. Sorry so short but a more indepth reveiw is beyond the scope of my time.
3,It's a good book for most work but not all encompassing,"This book is not meant to be the Honda shop manual, which is necessary if you're going to do hardcore work. But it's a good book to do some pretty detailed stuff. I changed the timing belt, pulled the fuel tank, replaced drive axles, did the brakes, re-wired some of the electrical system, fixed the a/c, all from this book."
2,Not what I was looking for,Very outdated. Most of what is in this book can be found online. The pictures were mostly to close and did not help me understand the work that I was doing. I ended up going to Honda sites on the web to fill in the gaps in the book.You are better off spending some time on the web than buying this book.
4,Impressive!,I have been wanting a battery power circular saw but was leery about how much power they would have and the battery life. I decided to try this one because of the Bosch name. I bought it to use out in the field for some corral boards since I don't have any power out there or own a generator. The saw works quite well for what I did with it. I wish the battery life was a little longer since I only have one.
5,"If you listen, you'll be captured","I couldn't believe it when I played this music for some non-musician, who told me, ""Oh, yeah, that's belly dancing music"". How dim. This is the favorite among the recordings that I own. I listen to many other kinds of music, but I play this when I want to smile and to cry."
5,Charming book for your children,I had to buy a second copy of this book - our first copy has seen a lot of use and enjoyment. A very charming children's version of a familiar parable. The pictures are absolutely adorable!
3,just enough,"First it is a nice set,and for someone with alot of experence it may be a great set. That being said there were a few problems.1. There is no CD or DVD on how to use this jig or how to set it up2. The wrong router guides were in the box from Porter Cable\3. the Instructions are hard to follow"
4,Easy Set Up,"This jig is easy to set up once you get past the not-so-well organized manual. With some patience, you'll get through it.I used this to make a dovetail jointed box of ebony and mahogany. After several test cuts, I sued it on the actual material and it worked well. I'm sure my future work will require much less test cuts as I get the hang of it. My dovetail joints were tight.Half blinds need a bit of practice as the routed round parts could show.Only downside is that I am stuck with 7-degree dovetail bits. I wish the angle were more obtuse. 7-degree does not look much different from box joints."
3,Stop! Product needs work!,"Read this before purchasing!I would suggest waiting and purchasing a more finely engineered device. Make sure yours has built in scales to indicate precise movement of adjustment of the jig, otherwise you end up ""eyeballing"" the movement of the template."
3,Finicky to adjust,"My jig arrived well packed and undamaged. The jig itself appeared to be well constructed out of quality materials. Don't expect to start cutting usable half blind dovetails right out of the box. I spent over a half a day minutely adjusting my router bit up and down, moving the template fore and aft and adjusting the side stop left and right before I hit the ""sweet spot"" for a well fitting joint. I did not even try the through dovetail feature as I repacked the jig and returned it to amazon. I decided I didn't want to go through the time consuming adjustment process every time I switched from thru dovetails to half blind or if I changed board thickness."
4,dovetail router jig,"This is quality, well constructed equipment designed to last. Read the manual and practice the various setups...you will need to fine tune your operation with a result of well fitting dovetail joints"
5,the set up is easy and the manual is simple step by step,I have been wanting a dovetail jig for quite a while. I am a beginner in woodworking but enjoy making decorative boxes. This jig will give me a lot of new joint options for all my projects. My first 2 attempts were not so good but on my third miniature dovetails turned out great. Set up is everything and by following the directions in the manual it was simple. I have never been disappointed in a porter cable tool and like the heavy duty feel of this one.
3,Comprehhensive text on telecommunications regulations,"Considering that this textbook was intended primarily for law school students, it is equally applicable to telecommunications graduate programs. The material presented is both interesting and helpful in understanding the law and regulation of telecommunications carriers."
2,Superficial,"I surprisingly agree with the other reviews. I would not agree that this is a good law school text book. The text - for a legal scholarly work - is largely devoid of citations. Thus the book as a secondary source recounts history almost as hearsay without an ability to get to the primary history. In addition, the subject matter is superficial and insufficiently developed. The Kingsbury Commitment, a huge moment in telecommunications history, is given one paragraph. There is little new here that is not in other books. There is content that is missing. The author discusses Computer I and Computer II, but not Computer III even though that proceeding took place well before the publication of this book."
1,One Star is Generous.,"The ""Book"" was a let-down. It failed to satisfy even my most basic expectations for this subject matter."
3,Narrator mispronouces,"Narrator was poor. He mispronounces several German leaders. Constantly mispronounces Admiral Karl Doenitz. It was very irritated. Also, sound quality was poor."
4,"Wandering, but not bad","Hey--So maybe the next time I head down to Mexico, I'll remember that more can happen to a visitor than winding up in a drunk tank... At times I found the author's naivite a little irritating, but he had a good enough sense of humor about himself that you ended up laughing along with him at him. His music-drops were usually bang on, though I have to take issue with some of his taste in music. I'd probably buy his next book to see where he goes from here, both stylistically and literally."
3,Heavy-going,"This book is excellent if you want great detail in chemistry, geology and physics. It's definitely required reading if that's what you're after with respect to Mars. On a philosophical and human level it's less convincing, somewhat wishy-washy in fact, with an unapologetic pro-American bias. It's obviously a very important work if you're concerned with the specific considerations for an economical and successful human settlement of Mars. But gripping reading it isn't. I found it rather tedious and hard to finish. If you're interested in the human colonization of space on a more general level, and want a decent and readable overview, I'd definitely recommend the same author's ""Entering Space"" over this title."
2,Too self-congratulatory,"Zubrin is a bit too self-congratulatory. The time he takes in each chapter to pat himself on the back drags down an otherwise interesting, if unrealistic, study of human space travel to Mars. All his assumptions leave little to no margin of error. Recent events have shown that accidents do happen to either expensive and/or tragic results. We're not yet to the point emotionally, economically or politically where we can be as cavalier as Zubrin's plan requires.On writing style, Zubrin manages to take an interesting subject and turn it into something dry and tedious to read. The pieces where he actually sticks to the science of Mars and of space travel, it's a quick and interesting read with informative graphics but these bits are hidden amongst long passages of minutiae relevant only to Zubrin."
2,Dated,This book is really dated and somewhat overly technical. A very dry and tedious read. I'm sure there are more recent and better written books on the topic.Not recommended.
1,The guy is full of hatered,"This guy is full of hatered, he depicts nasa as an evil organisation on every page.For those that don't know, this is Robert Zubrin, the man behind the Mars society, who is very smart but also the resident space crazy dude. He never smiles (though maybe I count a not-scowl as a smile and I have seen him do that), he tends to have outbursts and interrupt people"
5,Best prospace and Mars exploration book I have ever read.,"We have seen Zubrin's Mars Direct plans inTime, Ad Astra, Final Frontier, and other sources, but this is the full concept presented in a format meant to reach everyone. The bookis factual and allows anyone find out why it is important that we travel to Mars. Most importantly, Mars Direct explains the ""how"" and doesn't leave any details out. Every prospace organization should buy copies and mail them to on their members and Congressmen. -Darrick A. Dea"
5,A Variety of Mars Data in One Place,"Dr. Zubrin did a great job of bringing a lot of research about a variety of Mars related subjects into one place.His writing style is not sterile like a textbook might be, or how you would expect a 'rocket scientist' to write. Instead, he is able to present his ideas with facts, figures and calculations instead of glorious ideas of how to settle the stars. At times, the book even made me chuckle.I have read other books on this subject, and have seen documentaries regarding Mars exploration and Dr. Zubrin is arguably at the forefront of the effort to settle Mars.The book completely opened my eyes as to how easy (relatively speaking) it would be to actually settle Mars.HIGHLY recommended for anyone interested in the subject!"
4,I'm sold,I'm saddened to say that in the 12 years since this book was published we are no further along to the vision set out here in these pages.We have turned our government into one which would rather micromanage our lives than set forth a vision for all of humanity.While the book is slightly technical in nature any amateur interested in space exploration can pick this book up and understand the implications...it would even be easy to skip some of the tech stuff and read the meat of the book.The authors lay out not only the benefit to society but the cost...in a detailed (nearly line-by-line) description of what a manned mission to Mars would cost if the government ran it and what it could cost on a shoestring budget.Simply a WOW factor. I'm sold.
4,On to Mars!,"Zubrin is perhaps the von Braun of our generation, the visionary who will get us to Mars as von Braun got us to the moon. Unfortunately, Zubrin is not the insider that von Braun was, so it's going to be more of an uphill struggle.But this is the manifesto. It gets very technical, and spends most of the time explaining how his approach (involving generating fuel for the return trip on Mars) is technical feasible and in fact safer than most of the alternatives. It's only toward the end that he brings out Frederick Jackson Turner and espouses the frontier mentality that helped make America what it is. He proposes that Mars is the next frontier and that the colonists will be the great innovators and entrepreneurs of the future.I'm all in favor. Zubrin suggests that we could do it with 5 billion a year - a trifle, considering everything else the government spends its money on. Let's do it!"
3,Mixed Feelings,"This book is one of the few books that I have read on the subject of Mars exploration that has been written by an expert in the field. It is therefore well informed and Highly Interesting. Robert Zubrin put forward a convincing plan to bring man to the red planet. Unfortunately in the second part of the book the author goes a bit beyond his field. The economic arguments for colonizing mars are at time doubtful and naive. The plan to terraform Mars appears to be more science fiction than science. Finally the philosophical reason for the colonization are a matter of opinion that might not be shared by all. Over all the book is interesting, but one feels that the author should have more to the subject he knows well and not venture out to much into speculation, which blunt the overall effect of the book"
1,Can't get past the language...,"Once again, a potential great book is full of trash. This book is about a horrid time in US History, written in different perspectives, but has an author who thinks that filth will sell a book. It was pretty much impossible to read it (I actually didn't finish it because I couldn't get through the language) and there's no way that I can recommend this to anyone."
3,"Bennett describes the death of outrage, but not the cause.","This is a thoughtful (to those who agree) compendium of the case against Clinton. The obvious thesis: he assaults American ideals. What isn't included is an equally thorough explanation of why our collective response has, to date, been passive approval. So just what killed outrage? And, what does it's death mean for our future? The partisan perspective is mild, and unavoidable. It's fairly balanced by recollections of the Mother of all Gates--water. Had it been that very rare tome that sways minds inclined to the contrary, it would merit 5 stars. A more thorough crack at what (more than Bill) killed outrage--a four star rating. An alternative title directed toward the grim reaper of outrages's death, James Carville: It's about purjury, stupid."
1,Genius,"If the '80's were the Al Frankin decade then the '90's must be the Bill Bennett decade. I often wonder to myself when I'm watching the news, ""I wonder how this is affecting Bill Bennett?"" Fortunately for me, I never have to wonder for very long."
1,A better idea.,Wouldn't it be a better idea to issue a hollowed out version of Bennett & Heston's book so as to afford a place to hide my Smith & Wesson 38.
1,Ka-Ching went the cash register,"Gotta give Bennnet SOME credit - he sure knows how to turn incessant, self righteous whining into a mint.Of course, never mind that there was no ""outrage"" problem with Iran Contra and Oliver North's admitted purjury. Never mind that there was no ""outrage"" over James Watt, Ann Gorsuch Burford, Rita Lavelle, Ed Meese, the indifference to the homeless, the refusal to acknowledge the AIDS crisis, etc - all of which occurred during the Reagan administration in which Bennett served. Of course not. So called ""morality"" is strictly a partisan issue as far as Bennett is concerned.When will all those on the so called ""religious right"" realize, that Jesus spent far more time preaching against social injustice than he did over the human failings that have resulted in the current scandal that media darlings like Bennett are currently milking the cash cow about?"
1,Only in the United States,"Only in the United States could a head of state be dragged through the mud because of an affair. And only in the United States would a book like this be put in stores to peruade readers that the absurd is common sense and law. The Death of Good Writing: Bill Bennett and the Assault on American Intelligence - I would think. But then again, wasn't Mr Bennett the grand inquisitor of the drug war at some point. God Bless America!"
1,Death of Outrage? Not just now! Bennett's Holier Than Thou,"It is true, as he says: U.S. morals are low. Our outrage lasts shorter than Bill's afterglow. And yet, for this book, some rage I'll conjecture; it ain't Mr. Bennett should give us this lecture. Both donkeys and pachyderms share in good measure, not finding the will to resist easy pleasure. Subverting the Union: now, there's some real fun! Shout it out from the rooftops, that Nixon's The One! Oh, there's lots of past history, already told, by other reviewers, both the young and the old. So let me, as well, belly up to the bar. To give this excursion the rank of... one Starr."
1,Rather the Death of Principled Outrage,"It seems to be an impressive skill, the ability to fulminate so mightily at a man who takes more than the normal liberties with language to mask a personal indescretion- bet skip so lightly past those whose denials of knowledge or culpability are directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans.I refer, of course, to Tobacco Industry executives.A former academic such as he should have been capable of a much more nuanced treatment of the subject. Selective outrage? image-centered outrage?, Motherhood-and-Apple-Pie Outrage?, fin-de-siecle outrage? That assumes of course that he really intended to treat the issue in a genuinely ethical -rather that political- light."
1,Our 'National Nanny' strikes again,"What a burden it must be to be without sin.Sure, Bill Clinton is deeply flawed. The irony is Mr. Bennett should thank him for giving people like himself - i.e., people who have never really done anything and who are famous for being famous - a forum to rant and rake in the bucks.How would history be different if today's culture of self righteousness would have been applied to Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, or even FDR ?"
5,Clear and honest.,"Here is a well organised, rigorous, fair, and even compassionate argument as to why we as a people must take the responsibility to judge the actions of the Chief Executive and make informed decisions. The intent of this book is not so much to denounce Clinton (which it does well), but to give an intellectual and moral ""call to arms.""No one who gives ""Death of Outrage"" a serious read could brand it as ""partisan."" Rather, it is more of a (much needed) refresher course in Civics."
5,Let's get more positive,The morals of our President are truly a disgrace. This morality sometimes can lead impressionable people to think it is OK to act immorally. I am sick of all this filth. I prefer more uplifting reading like 'Life and Death on the Internet' by Keith A Schroeder. We should be solution orientated as a society rather than spectators of the political scene.
4,A great window into the Clinton Scandal and cover-up.,"After the first two chapters I was convinced. After the whole book, I was outraged."
1,Bill Bennett makes outrageous sums of money,"""Dost thou think because thou art 'virtuous,' there shall be no more cakes and ale?"" -- Shakespeare. Given what we now know about Thomas Jefferson -- that he kept a black slave as a concubine for 30 years and lied about it -- it would appear that outrage was dead long before Bill Bennett stumbled across its bloated corpse. Bennett, of course, sheathed his outrage when his benefactor Ronald Reagan let Oliver North run wild in the White House (contravening the law of the land and the will of Congress), and when George Bush lied about his role in the Iran-Contra affair. It would be wise to remind Bennett that Dante set aside the harshest of all hellfire for the hypocrite. Have fun, Bill."
2,"Predictable, Reasonable restatement of Social Conservativism","William Bennett provides a consise statement of the issues that are pertinent to a social conservative appraisal of the Clinton Whitehouse. The book lacks inspiration, however, and fails to ellicit the outrage it proports to deliver. The issues presented are certainly outrageous, as we all know, but we as readers hope to have our natural perceptions amplified by the sage observations of a cultural guru. This expectation is left unfulfilled. Clarification occurs, but passion is lacking."
1,They chopped down trees for this?,"Frankly let's face it. If Clinton was Republican this book would not have been written. If it is 'morality' that Bennett is concerned with why doesn't he investigate the moral conduct of the likes of Gingrich and Mr Hyde - to start with. If the President is to set good moral example, so too do other senior politicians - no more and no less."
2,Many of us are repulsed by those loudly claiming to be repul,"What Mr. Bennett and many of the Republicans fail to realize is that many of their fellow Americans are nauseated by the many Puritan hangups concerning human sexuality from which periodic eruptions occur. The Pharisaically judgmental are more repulsive to many of us, more ""ugly"" than those fellow sinners who ""fall."" Their self-righteous posturing is tiresome and repulsive. Preoccupation with blow jobs in the White House is unbelievable when one considers the global issues that confront us at home and ""globally."" Claiming that the real issue is perjury does not dignify the discussion. What I fear is the unreality that characterizes so many of the conservatives on these issues. Thankfully, the right tends to self-destruct--I hope."
2,Bennett's outrage is pretty hollow,"Bennett's ""Death of Outrage"" has a thesis and it is excellently presented. However, there's this little point about the author having worked proudly in the Reagan Administration, probably the most dangerous time in the Republic's history for lies and shadow governments, and refusing to recognize or at least acknowledge that the death of outrage began, not with Clinton, but his ex-boss President Reagan whose web of lies and usurping of congressional authority and laws made Richard Nixon's former activities seem trite."
5,Finally,"An outstanding summation of not only the Clinton/Lewinsky affair and why it is so important an issue, but also a brief review of the overwhelming number of misdeeds and obfuscations by the Clinton administration. After eight months of stonewalling and attacks by the Administration on Ken Starr and anyone who would criticize this president, Bennett pulls the facts--more rather than less, sooner rather than later--into a comprehensive and coherent argument as to why character is important in our elected officials and why, while no one is perfect, Bill Clinton is so far from meeting the minimal standards of acceptable behavior; he must leave the office of President.I doubt it will change the minds of hardcore Clinton supporters, but reasonable people hesitant to judge the President, may gain a better understanding of the scope of Clinton's misdeeds and why the electorate has an obligation to render judgment on such behavior. We can do better and we must."
1,How can Republicans be this predictable?,"This is yet another part of the continuing Republican propaganda assault on Clinton. Perhaps Bennett's next book could discuss the lack of honesty, morality and ethical behavoir in the Regan administration. I was truly sorry that I read the book."
1,Proof of the Clinton moral decay!,"Damn those Clintons! They were so successful in their campaign to tear down the morals of America, they caused poor, chaste Bill Bennett to become a voracious gambler! And if that wasn't enough, we now have evidence that they hypnotized poor Rush Limbaugh into developing an addiction to illegal drugs! It's not their fault, folks. The Clintons made 'em do it! Thank God we have upstanding Americans like William Bennett to keep us on the moral high road and expose the immorality the Clinton presidency foisted upon our great nation. Look what they've done to the poor, innocent conservatives!"
5,Bennett's book is a clarion call to moral excellence.,The book is a clarion call to moral excellence in politics and in everyday life. It is a challenge to the ethical nihilism that pollutes the moral environment. Bennett's work offers hope that America will not slide into the cultural garbage heap in which too many citizens delight.
3,"On target, but could have been much shorter.","Mr. Bennett delves into various philosophical, legal, and moral issues surrounding the Lewinsky scandal, and deals with each in what sounds like a very fair tone. His thoughts need to be considered in the public debate, whether or not you agree with them. Unfortunately, Bennett's tone suggests that he feels Clinton is relatively unique as Presidents go - - for instance, we are not reminded of Pres. Bush's pardoning of Cap Weinberger, but Bennett does remind us of Walsh when Bennett wants to put Judge Starr in a better light. Sadly, this could have been much shorter (perhaps an article in the Atlantic at most), and should not be a $20 book. I recommend you try to borrow it. If you must buy it, then do, and lend it to many."
4,An accurate depiction of the lack of presence by the people.,"Those readers who wish to judge this book simply by the author's language will get out of it only as much as they put in. The rest of us who understand that the country's founding moral standards are dying can completely identify with this book and all of its underlying priciples. Many people suggest that the President's personal conduct is ""none of our business."" When the President puts himself and our nation upon a pedestal for the world to ridicule, it is time for the American people to become outraged. Why is this so difficult to understand? Why do we presume that we can fix the country's many growing problems without first addressing their origin within our people? Bennet's book is the hard truth - American's just don't want to face it."
1,What a load of moralist cow dung!,"I believe that ""outrage"" is alive and well. I felt tremendous outrage after I paid good money for this piece of crap. No, I'm not some liberal who hates Bill Bennett. I've voted Republican most of my life, but this book was preachy and arrogant in the worst sort of way. Don't waste your time!"
1,Carville is better,"For those who have been hornswoggled by Bill Bennet's insufferable moral superiority, I highly recommend James Carville's "". . . And the horse he rode in on. It's a devastating indictment against Grand Inquisitor Kenneth Starr. It's available on Amazon.com."
1,Be serious...,"Bennett decries the ""death"" of outrage in this lightweight, paperback-sized volume of 160 pages that retails for twenty bucks. Well, there's the outrage: twenty bucks to pay Bennett for twenty minutes of rehashing his old tune."
1,The Outrage Should Be At Bennett's Mindboggling Hypocrisy,"Having read through Bennett's sanctimonious tirades against one of the most successful presidents of the 20th Century, a man who accomplished the goal of leading the nation through a prosperous and peaceful eight years, all the while fending off right wing idealogues intent on staging a coup d'etat for sexual indiscretions, I am struck that there is not more information in his book on what recent revelations have indicated is an area in which Bennett has vastly more experience---losing millions of dollars in slot machines. I believe a little more soul searching and introspection and a little less piety would do old Bill a world of good. Just a thought."
3,Where's the Autopsy?,"Great title, but unfortunately the book was written before the impeachment proceedings.Those drawn to this book will probably be the choir; Bennett fairly states the Clinton problem and offers even-handed parallels to Nixon, but does not attempt to explain why outrage died between then and now, which is what I expected to read.Await the sequel for the missing insight, now that we all know that outrage is alive and well (i.e., the Tripp prosecution). Bennett will have to re-dissect the ""throw no stones"" Clinton defense. The book fails as a political autopsy, and only hints at the underlying disease. Surely Bennett will follow up with all the new data now available."
1,You've Got to Know when to Hold Em,"Know when to Fold em, know when to walk away, Know when to run...!Bill, get away from those slot machines with all the money you are making from your moral outrage book...tsk tsk tsk and for shame!"
5,Buying or Selling a Pool Table,"On the back cover of this book it says, the book ""is an investment: It could save you hundreds of dollars if you are serious about buying or selling a pool table."" And this is exactly what it did. I would have wasted a thousand dollars on a worthless table had I not read Mr. Duane's book first. Thank you Sir!"
5,Another great book by Mose Duane,"This is the second book I've purchased by Mose Duane. His writting and advice is straight forward and to the point. If you are going to buy or sell a table, you must read this.The last section even ranks the major table makers. This book will save you a ton of money."
1,Horrible picture quality,"The picture quality might, just might, be acceptable if viewed on a 2"", or smaller, display. But, when on a big screen of any size, the horrid quality makes itself known. What a rip."
4,America's Castles,"I bought this DVD because I don't have a VCR. If I did, I would have purchased America's Castles Part I ON VIDEO. Why? The music! The music on the video version and the music on the DVD version are different and it matters because when I am away from the tv, I can hear the music and the music gives me an image of what magnificent Castle home is being shown. In my mind I can still see the images. This matters only if you've seen the video version FIRST. Otherwise this DVD purchase is great, very informative in fact even more than the video version etc...but what I wouldn't give to have the SAME MUSIC which was so much more in line, so much more grand and in keeping with the opulence of these fabulous palace-homes. Ah well! I'm still pleased BUT truth be told if I'd known the music was different, I'm not sure if I'd have purchased this."
5,Fluke Probes,These are very high quality probes. They are easy to use and take accurate readings. They adapt to any meter that utilizes a banana plug.
5,Good quality leads,I purchased these leads to use with the precision tips that fluke also makes. Im definitely happy about this purchase. They have plenty of length and are well made. Highly recommended especially with the precision tips for using with small wire connectors.
4,A 1992 important recording,"This album features Eva's incredible version of ""Over the Rainbow"". The album was made in 1992, yet that song only started to get the attention it deserved in recent times! The rest of the album is a mix of solo tracks and duets with the funkmaster Chuck Brown. While not her greatest album, it boasts beautiful renditions of ""You've Changed"" and ""Fever"". Add the beautiful ""over the Rainbow"" and you still have an album worthy of any decent CD collection.If Eva had lived to see the impact that ""Over the Rainbow"" has had on so many people, she would be truly amazed."
5,one of the best cd's ever recorded,"This is a great cd.The arrangements are outstanding and the musical presentation is the best. The cd also has a wonderful mix with a version on ""You've Changed"" that is the best that I have ever heard. This is one of my favorate cds, and I play it frequently.If I only had one cd this would be my choice."
5,Eva 's music is the kind that you will never forget.,"This isn't so much a review as a testimonial to her talents, just in case you are trying to decide if you should buy her CD's. Eva died very young so anything that is released by her is treasured by me and her other many fans. You will never be the same after listening to her music. Hopefully her family will continue to release her recorded music for us to enjoy for many years to come."
5,the other side,The other side was the last CD to arrive. It is very enjoyable. The three were ordered at the same time. Time after time came within six days and American tune was somewhere in between getting here.
5,Magic...,"the newly legendary Eva Cassidy. ""...a voice that stops you in your tracks."" ""...that girl can Sing!"" ""...you'll never be the same after listening."" Here was the first CD of an impossibly shy and tragic but now memorably enduring musical genius that only our Digital Lifestyle could have widely introduced."
1,This story deserves better,"George Harrison's visit to Benton, Illinois, just months before the Beatles broke through in the U.S. is a fascinating story, but you wouldn't know it by watching this film. The movie is nearly unwatchable with long, uncut interviews, few cutaway shots, poor audio, and jittery video. This subject deserves much better treatment."
1,Most Boring Beatle Video Ever,I don't want to be mean BUT.. I spent my hard-earned money on this thing and it's horribly boring. This video does not include your interest regarding the subject; it should be better. Save your money and buy the Pete Best Beatle video or an All Starr DVD instead. Profoundly disappointing.
1,Ladder Fountain is All Wet!,"Just remember the old adage: you get what you pay for! This fountain was so badly designed that the hose pushed up in the base where I couldn't get to it right out of the box! I had to become a plumber and purchase new piping and a new pump (the one that came with it is only supposed to last THREE MONTHS)to get the thing to work. Even then, the water trickling from the fountain was so weak, it would have been more effective to squeeze a sponge over the top and down the fountain!Save your money. It would be better to just put your head under the water in your bath tub and blow water through a straw!"
4,The complete story of the Aircraft Carrier to 1979.,"This author is an acknowledged expert on Ships - especially naval ships and this is one of his best works. It tells the complete story of the Aircraft Carrier from their humble origins in WW1 right up to 1979.Using some incredible historic photographs - many of which I had not previously seen, this book would have scored the full 5 Star rating had it not been 25 years out of date. Nevertheless, there is still a lot to learn from this excellent work.NM"
3,"While she was out,she kicked butt.","Kim Basinger plays Della,an ordinary surburban house wife with two twins and a abusive husband played by Craig Sheffer.Della decides to go out to do a little last minute shopping at a mall.She becomes frusterated trying to find a place to park and sees a old beat up junker taking two spots.Della leaves a note does her business and comes out to find 4 punks waiting for her.Chucky played by Lukas Haas is great as the head punk who hunts her down inside a construction site.She only has a tool box to protect herself with but its enough.Its a good little film but the dialogue could of been better.There was one in there I thought was corny.Della says to Chucky....""Chucky Huh? ""Did your mother name you that?"" and he replies..""Nope I did."" OOOY! Anyway its still a good movie but short."
2,Why'd I bother with this one?,"While She Was Out a lot of things could have happened, some of which might even have been interesting and entertaining. Unfortunately, most of what happened while the She in the title of the film was out is neither. At least not for my tastes.A friend of mine that loves these sorts of films would probably beg to differ. He (husband of a former co-worker) always raves about how some slasher/thriller film is the most excellent thing he's ever seen, and I just sort of turn a deaf ear to such talk. I'd much prefer a good solid drama or laugh my rear-end off comedy instead. Even a bad comedy is normally much better than this sort of film. If only I had followed my instincts and ignored this one.On the plus side, I guess I know at least one person that will get some enjoyment out of watching this."
4,While you expected!!!!,"Excellent thriller (better even on Blu-ray). Unexpected twists await as one learns that even the least aggressive and dangerous of people, can react so unexpectedely when threatened. Underrated film, is much better than anticipated!"
4,better than I expected,"Kim Basinger has portrayed some of the most diverse roles of any actress over the last couple of decades in movies ranging from ""My Stepmother is an Alien"" to ""9 1/2 Weeks"" to ""L.A. Confidential"" (for which she won an Oscar). This film let's her stretch her legs (literally this time, as she has to perform quite a few action sequences herself) yet again. While she gives her usual solid performance, this isn't the best movie she's ever done. The ""gang"" she comes up against is really more of a group of young punks than a real gang, which explains their ineptitude when they to try to kill her for witnessing an accidental shooting they were involved in. I actually enjoyed most of this film. The only part I thought ended up being very predictable was the last few seconds of the film, when she was back at home with her husband. Overall, a good, but not great effort."
3,"Has some creep-out factors, but overall nothing special.","While She Was Out takes the standard exploitative-style revenge but adds a more Lifetime channel-ish approach.The film is a bit creepy at times and fairly well acted, but gets a little stale and slow for large portions of time.If you're interested in the story, check it out."
2,Poor Kim,"Della is an abused wife and she's about as beaten down as a person can be. One night, she is accosted by four young hoodlums who chase her into the woods. As the brutal thugs close in on her, she finds herself fighting for her life.Kim Basinger used to be a big star and a good actress, but not this time. This is a cheaply-made, amateurish movie that uses violence and gore in place of character and dialogue, and she has no chance to shine. There aren't any surprises and it actually gets tedious waiting for the baddies to catch Della who is armed with only her trusty tool box, and manages to overcome years of abuse and emerge a strong woman in short order. Lukas Haas plays the gang leader and he's good at playing ruthless types, but his dialogue gets sillier and sillier and his last scene is nothing if not bizarre.A quickie indie movie that features repulsive characters tormenting a fragile woman; it gets old fast."
2,a girl and her toys,"first off, i guess kim was happy that she had the stuff for her ""mechanic's class"" with her and not the stuff for her french class - that would not have helped. a group of four well-balanced thugs (one black, one white, one asian and one hispanic)kill a mall cop in front of kim while harrassing her and that leads to .... well a lot of dumb dialogue and tripping through the woods. kim uses her tools and pent-up anger at her husband to pick them off one minority at a time. since we all know from murder one that is the movie, we just wait for the murder between scenes of falling, tripping, and swearing for each little thug to get it. the so-called surpise ending is about as anticpated and unexpected as christmas carols at christmas."
4,Amusing Slasher Fun,"OK,right off the bat I gotta tell ya that Kim is still looking mighty good as she plays this untalented homemaker in an awful marriage and her fight with local punks as she struggles to return to her awful rugrats.There's lots of humor injected into the plot which is rather familiar to me after watching the past 30+ yrs of these types of movies but I did find it pretty fun and the 86 minutes went by at a decent pace while waiting for the next death.I was totally won over by the surprise ending and the great choice of ending song by Roxy Music,which I won't reveal the song choice here but it's funny.I went into this not expecting much but I found it much better than many of the movies I see and I will want to see it again somewhere down the line. (Now that I own the DVD!)"
1,This was bad,"Some actors must have contracts with the studio to just act in films and fill roles no matter what the story, plot, etc. This was obviously one of those films. Kim Basinger is a great actress but even her decent acting could not save this way below par film. The story was redundant and the plot was predictable. I'll be tossing this one for sure."
2,Fumbling around for a Decent Plot,"Kim Basinger stars and produces in ""While She Was Out"". She plays a suburban housewife married to an abusive jerk who needs to go out on Christmas Eve for a few last minute items. When she arrives, the mall is extremely crowded but somewhow after buying a few things and glimpsing a nighty, the mall is a ghost town when she leaves(no comment). She is harrassed by 4 moronic thugs who then murder a security guard who comes to her rescue. From there, the second half of the movie takes to the woods where the thugs chase her and shoot at her and utter some really stupid dialogue and curse a lot.Basinger's performance is fine and there is a little bit of suspense in the woods but there's not much else going for it. The other characters are silly and asinine. It reminds me a little of ""Blair Witch Project"" with a lot of the time spent in the woods in the dark fumbling around for a plot. 2 stars is as high as I could give this one."
2,hmmm. . .maybe not,"Unfortunately, this turned out to be less than what i had hoped. I *loved* Kim Basinger in LA Confidential, so thought I'd give this a whirl. Unfortunately, for the most part, this movie is your typical woman witnesses crime and baddies hunt her down and try to get her. I like more psychological thrillers that are more cat-and-mouse, one opponent cleverly outsmarting the other type movies. This movie wasn't that. And aside from Ms. Basinger, who was good, and one scene by Lukas Haas, the acting(or perhaps it was the script?) was not very good. All those problems aside, the movie does have one excellent scene between Basinger and Haas, and a better ending than I would have expected."
2,Never Leave Nasty Notes,"Kim Basinger was a great Hollywood beauty and talented actress. In this film she plays an abused wife who becomes a victim of young thugs--inciting them by leaving a nasty note beneath their car's window wipers. They intend to gang rape her and then kill her and the movie is about how she handles this situation.As others have noted, the plot was predictable and it is indeed sad to watch such a talented actress (and still attractive woman) reduced to such roles. One can only wonder if the personal abuse she suffered in her well-publicized bitter marriage motivated her to accept this role and act out abused victim-turned-revenged."
1,Must be seen,"55 yr old kim basinger being chased by ""bad ass"" lukas haas and his cronies thru the woods. she ambushes them all rambo-style plunging tire irons thru their eyeballs, a giant knitting needle thru the eardrum, etc. then she has sex with haas at the end after the others are dead, only to pull out a flare and try to shove it in his mouth. it is absolutely hysterical. boy Alec mustve really destroyed her self esteem for her to be in this crap.Some of the things you will learn from watching this movie...1. even lukas haas seems imposing when hes flanked by 2 puerto ricans and a black.2. if youre a hot chick and the killer is about to shoot you.....diffuse the whole situation by having sex with him.3. even 55 yr old kim basinger can outrun 4 young thugs while carrying a toolbox"
2,Kim Basinger. Why?,"Kim Basinger is an Academy-Award winning actress! I can't believe she was in this movie. OK, it wasn't as terrible as you may think and her character isn't horrible - but the plot is just dumb. Basically, this abused housewife goes to get wrapping paper at a mall during Christmas time - takes a parking place and is then followed and tortured for an hour by a group of thugs. I don't know if it was a metaphor for how she felt in her life (being abused by her husband and getting to fight back finally...) I couldn't understand why Basinger chose to do this! It didn't even seem like a really good ""acting"" piece. Maybe she just wanted to do a thriller, who knows. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"One of the weakest ""revenge"" thrillers of all time","Do the people who made ""While She was Out"" even watch movies? If they did, they'd know that revenge films require two things: villains who commit reprehensible acts, and a lead character who violently turns the tables. Anyone excited by the prospect of seeing a good actor like Kim Basinger in a modern-day exploitation flick along the lines of ""Ms .45"" can keep looking, because ""While She Was Out"" is neither thrilling nor satisfying. At no point did I find the gang terrorizing her to be at all frightening or intimidating, and the film left me waiting anxiously for Kim to open up that red toolbox and start taking these guys apart. Credits rolled, and nothing. The DVD art is incredible, throwing out a ""Hard Candy"" type of vibe that the film never comes close to delivering."
2,"Same old, same old...","""While She Was Out"" is a predictable spin on the vigilante thriller. Della (Kim Basinger) lives in a gated community and is a devoted mom married to an abusive, former jock (Craig Sheffer). She has the appearance of a delicate -- even fragile -- creature, incapable of inflicting harm on others. But that changes after she is accosted by a gang of thugs while doing some last-minute Christmas shopping. Their leader, Chuckie (Lukas Haas), is clearly a sociopath itching to cause some serious pain. The lone Della must defend herself for her very survival as she improvises defenses with garage tools and ingenuity. Basinger is good and elicits a degree of sympathy, but when things start looking awfully familiar, that sympathy dissipates. The film is rated R.Bonus extras include audio commentary with writer/director Susan Montford, a making-of featurette, and theatrical trailer."
1,don't even waste your time,"I like Kim Basinger, but this movie? I'm sorry. The story doesn't really make sense, the message are totally wrong and dark. The acting is so so.... the thriller is even lamer than you could imagine. It's so predictable and what's the point of this movie again? thriller? moral message? I can't find anything interesting in this movie (which I kept hoping that it will come soon ). I fast forward 2x most of the film because it's way too slow just to tell this story. Don't even bother wasting your time and money to try watching or even renting it."
3,Christmas Debacle,"Kim Basinger and Lukas Haas would fare better in other material. Lukas, as the villain, is not terribly convincing as a leader of a gang of thugs out to instigate Basinger's demise. This film is more a statement on Christmas and how impersonal it has become, as the film takes place during the holiday. As Basinger's abused wife Della overcomes adversity throughout movie, we find her faced with a more personal one when she finally returns home. 'While She Was Out' hits and misses, but does look great on Blu-ray. Try it only if you favor Basinger and want to see her carry a film."
2,How a toolbox can save your life and end others,"While She Was Out could have been really good, but there just wasn't much plot or character development. It's only 80 minutes long and consists mainly of Kim Basinger (maybe the best looking 55 year old woman I've seen) running around in the woods and taking out the bad guys using a few tools from her trusty tool box. It's more of a suspense movie, but one kill is straight out of a horror flick. The acting by the villains wasn't intimidating at all, but Kim Basinger does fairly decent given the material. I didn't see the last shot of the film coming, but it is still a weak mess as a whole. You might want to check out a similar movie called Eden Lake (except the killers are young teens), which is better made and features much better acting."
2,Formatting needs repair,"I read this years ago as a young soldier. It was required reading for cavalry officers in my regiment. I thought I would load it up on the Kindle and read it again with the benefit of 25 years experience. The text is, of course, marvelous. However, the formatting is awful. Sentence breaks don't line up, but rather break at odd intervals through the page. It makes reading considerably less enjoyable. If there is a way for me to repair this I hope someone will let me know. Otherwise - needs work is the best I can say."
5,Book review,I had to order this book for a class. It has been the best so far in all the books we have had to read for that class. Shipping was fantastic! The book was in very good condition and the price was good also.
2,Formatting is a dog's breakfast,Every 2nd line of the text of this book is broken in half and continues on the following line. Now I suspect that with about 1 hours work this could be fixed. Hint. Use MS Word search & replace feature to remove unwanted paragraph breaks that are created in the digital conversion process (I'm pretty sure that this is where it went wrong).How on earth do people market stuff that is so obviously defective?I'm baffled at so many review praising the content - and I don't doubt it's great - but which simply ignore the fact that the text is virtually un-usuable. Is there a better formatted version out there?
3,Should Have Gone With The Classic Edition...,"I purchased this book at the Miami International Book Fair last year, and began reading it several weeks ago. It's okay, but according to the Introduction, there's an older translation of this work that exists which was written over 300 years ago. I should have gone with that edition instead, as I don't like reading modern translations of classic works if there's an older (and usually much better, as it's in Old English) version available.The work itself is very good. I recommend it."
2,No blue oceans,"This ball was intended to be used as a teaching tool, but the water is not blue. As a result, it is difficult to use because all of the water areas are transparent and distracting. It is also only 12 inches."
1,Not as advertised,"I ordered this product to use in a craft project and was very disappointed. The oceans were not blue,they were clear. The size was definitely not 16"". It was much smaller."
3,Flo,"I bought this as a gift for a friend but it turned out to be too small a size. I decided to keep it, instead. It will go into my classroom."
2,Not Pleased,I'm sorry I have to say this but i did not get an invoice and two of the Globes had wholes in them. To be fair I did not send them back because we needed the other two globes for the students that day.
3,Flat Earth,"Not nearly as round as the picture, but it kind of gives perspective of sizes of countries and continents I wouldn't call it a ball - it's shorter than it is wide. But I was disappointed in the overall poor construction. i had a great Earth beach ball some time ago, and I've been looking to replace it. This doesn't even come close to fitting the bill."
3,Great for BASIC geography!,"If you're looking for a current political globe, you'll have to look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for a cheap party decoration, or a fun way to introduce children 2-5 years to the ideas of globe, continents, and oceans...then this is money well spent.This is actually our second ball, the first was rolled, thrown, sat on, and pushed around until it developed a hole and deflated. For under $4 it's not a big deal to replace it.When the kids are elementary school age I'll worry about whether the countries are labeled correctly, but for now this has been a great way to introduce basic geography skills to my preschoolers. We've even used it to discuss Tsunamis, magma, earthquakes, day/night, and seasons!"
1,Inflateable Globe,"Arrived in an enevelope and sure looks a lot smaller than 16"" there are much nicer ones out there that are 12"" and look much bigger"
3,"Misshapen globes, but still fun","Most of the globes I purchased were an odd shape when blown up, but still worked fro my classroom lessons."
2,They sent the wrong one to me.,They sent the clear ocean to me and it is difficult to read. But for the money I'm not wasting my time returning it. So there you have it.
1,crap,This was worse quality than you would find at your local dollar store. It arrived withe a hole in it.
4,Good homeschool tool,Product is great for homeschooling. Product is cheap so the kids can write on it with marker during lessons for interactive learning.
1,You will NOT get the globe pictured here.,"This globe was cheap. It will help you point out where countries are to your child. Other than that, it is crap. It is NOT the globe pictured here. This one is clear (not blue). It's also smaller. It's made extremely poorly to the point where the seam artificially squishes the countries. The most frustrating part is that it is NOT what I ordered. I contacted the seller and they told me it was amazon's problem because amazon does the shipping. PLEASE FIX THE PICTURE AND DESCRIPTION!!"
3,Eath Ball,"The ball they sent me was clear! It did not have blue oceans. Also, the inside of the ball looked like dirt or water had been in it at one time. Was it used?? The plug would only stay in for awhile but would pop out really easily and deflate."
1,don't waste your money,"I ordered this inflatable globe so my young kids (1 and 3) could have fun with a ball in the pool and perhaps cultivate a love of geography in them. And I would be lying if I didn't say that I myself was very excited about this toy. The other reviews of the item were spot on, the ball isn't even as round as a typical beach ball, the printing is horrible, and the maps are way out of date and inaccurate. Please if anyone is looking for an inflatable globe for educational or playtime value, look elsewhere."
1,"Could have been great, but it is not","An inflatable beach ball that is also a globe could have been a huge hit by combining learning and physical fun for kids. Unfortunately this product is a poor execution on a great idea.As has been stated by many others, there are a lot of misprints, and the map is out of date by 20 years. What is more worrysome is the strong chemical smell that comes out of this product, and makes me wonder if this toy is safe for use by children."
3,Still good but not what I expected,"Inexpensive and my daughter plays with it most days. The ocean space is not solid blue as pictured but clear so you can see through it. It is also not perfectly round as pictured. Smaller than a beach ball, the panels give it 6 flat surfaces so it does not roll smoothly like a sphere. It works, it's fine but I was expecting something like the picture."
4,Very good product,"Very good educational toy. My son enjoy learning and playing with it. For initial hours, toy has very strong color smell, I would suggest to keep product in open area for couple of hours and then allow kids to play.Overall, I like the product and I recommend it."
3,Ow!!!,"These shoes are so cute and they go with everything. However, they are not very comfortable - at least for my feet. The insole hurts on the big toe side. I still wear them, just not if I'm going to be on my feet for very long."
2,"Very Cute, But Very Slick:","I ordered these in green, and this is the first pair of Nine West shoes I might have to donate. They hurt the tops of my feet after walking for just a few minutes, and the bottoms are SLICK. I fell down some carpeted stairs at work in these, and I slipped in my driveway (which was not wet). Unfortunately, I just can't work in shoes that slide all over."
4,Great Little Shoe,"These are a truly cute shoe, flattering on the foot. They look cute with skirts, shorts and slacks. But a word of caution, as is the case with many Nine West shoes, they do tend to run a bit narrower than their marked width--which works for me as I have a narrow foot."
1,Pretty much useless,"I've used the other Pico products with the built in solder and adhesive heat shrink and they work great (see my other reviews), but these butt connectors are pretty much useless in my opinion. The solder width is far too narrow for the wires both the wires (inserted at each end) to be covered, but even worse, the heat shrink insulator turns soft before the solder melts and and the whole assembly then falls apart under gravity."
5,Excellent Guide For Caregivers of Women,"This is an excellent resource for clinicians caring for women during the childbearing process. An excellent discussion that is easy to follow. There is practical use to this guide, and clinicians should definitely take note of this text for their shelf."
5,I love this book!!!,"Kids in my Kindergarten class love this book and ask me to read it over and over. It's a great book to get kids talking about kindness and what makes a loving family. I agree with everything the previous reviewer wrote and I am surprised at the couple of negative reviews. One wrote, ""the story shows the world as almost entirely evil""... I think it shows the world through the eyes of a little puppy, something young kids can really relate to. The same person wrote, ""the illustrations... were frightenning and conducive to nightmares"". Are we talking about the same book?"
1,It's ok to dump unwanted animals on the side of the road????,"I picked up this book because it looked like a cute heartwarming story about a little dog at Christmas time. What I found was frankly appalling. What is it saying to our children when a storybook talks about leaving a dog on the side of the road simply because his family didn't want him anymore? The responsibility of having a pet is very big and is a hot topic for many families. And to teach a child that it is OK to ""throw away"" a pet is unacceptable. I urge you to not get this book and I am throwing mine straight in the garbage."
2,Bruce Campbell interview...,"The Bruce Campbell interview was fun. It was interesting seeing him out of the ""hollywood"" area. I thought he might be in one of the films but, the short movies were mostly by unknows, which brings us full circle...I remember when BC was a unknown, and come to think of it, him is still a B level movie star...which is ok with us."
5,Beautiful Suprise,"This fragrance is by far my FAVORITE. I have been searching all over for this particular fragrance and found it here on Amazon. I get compliments all of the time from both males and females. I purchased what I thought was only a 3.4 oz bottle of fragrance. When my package came it was a 4-piece set. It included bath gel, body lotion and a travel size fragrance. I am very pleased with my purchase. The shipment arrived in only 3 business days! If you are looking for a long lasting, flirty fragrance buy this."
4,Love it!!,I got this for my daughter and it is comfy and stylish! She loves it and so does my husband!!
2,Ick.,"Sonny Sharrock's playing on this sounds like Santana. Too fusion-y for my taste. Try Black Woman - his crazy, spiritual, spazz out for not only his best, but one of the greatest albums ever."
3,good noise,"This album is not one of Sharrock's greatest, but it nonetheless reveals Sharrock's playing style to the maximum degree. Some listeners of Jazz may be put off by the seemingly noisy playing style, and the ultra-saturated distortion of Sharrock's guitar, but the more you listen to the music, the more you feel that Sharrock is actually doing something bsides just making a lot of noise. Better than this album though, is the folk-rocky tinted ""Seize the Rainbow,"" which features two drummers and some of Sharrock's smoother songs."
3,Shipping is too slow via PacelPool,I recived the item two weeks later than the estimated delivery date. It seems it is too slow via ParcelPool.
4,so timely,This was a compelling page-turner with a great plot. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it.
5,Chi-lites on Brunswick Vol.1,I received this item in three business days and it is new just as it stated on the web page.The price was lower than I had found on any other site and of course with this I am well pleased. I am looking forward to another purchase from Amazon.
3,Schauberger,I was originally attracted to this device because of the ideas of Viktor Schauberger. He was the first to really study water and the changes that come from vortexes. This device works... it spins the water in a vortex but I have a few issues about it. First problem is the shape of the container itself is wrong. It is cylindrical. Water naturally gains structure in wild natural settings.... it meanders in streams and flows in vortexes. It falls in rain droplets in vortexes. Water even makes up the blood of our veins and courses in vortexes. The problem is when water is induced to unnatural settings mainly... moving through pipes and cylinder like devices. For this device to get better reviews from me it would have to: Be opaque. Light is damaging to the water. 2. Be egg shaped. Eggs are the best vessel shape for holding water. 3. A material other than plastic.I bought this device about 4 years ago but I still use it though
4,Seeing crimes through the eyes of a killer,"This is an interesting book. I watched the movie first and as a result I wanted to be sympathetic to Mr Panzram. After reading the book, i did change my opinion about the man. Although the book tries to blame the justice system for his actions, his own words give you insight into a mind that is self absorbed and feels that the rules of society only apply to others but not to him. I didn't give the book 5 stars only because the authors don't blame Panzram for his own actions."
5,Well written account of a true monster.,"I've always wondered what made people like this do such awful and disgusting things as described in this book. I now have a better understanding after reading it. Not all criminals are made by bad parenting skills or savage prison systems but in this case it can't be mistaken what lead this man into what he would eventually become. Everything about Carl Panzram's story is a tragedy. His days as a child, adulthood, his confessed murders,the sickening natures of these murders and even his own death (which he gladly welcomed with open arms) will make anyone thankful they were not subject to these conditions."
3,"Thank you, Jerry Weller","Well, if the book has too few photos in an age of YouTube video, then it can't compete, regardless of the price !!!I will not buy it."
5,Perfect gift,Price was good and my wife enjoyed her gift for anniversary. I can recommend decision to buy this watches.
4,VALUE FOR MONEY,This watch is really value for money and it's presentable. I got this watch for my girl friend's mum and she is please with it and she starts using it since then.
3,"Not bad, but nothing special",The book consists from 10 chapters from different authors. Some chapters are quite useful and offer general overview of postmodern feminist attitudes. Other chapters are not very interesting and don't offer any new ideas or opinions. Authors tried to show how postmodern feminist perspectives can be used in research in social work but sometimes are suggestions too vague.
4,very helpful,"Pirates for a fantasy novel I'm currently writing spurred my interest in Viking ships. The details in this book stretched my vocabulary and fired my imagination. Short but full of facts and great illustrations, it gave me just what I needed, and I really enjoyed the challenges of learning a little about ship building."
5,Panasonic DVD Recorders lives up to good reviews,"Hi,I read good reviews about the Panasonic DMR-ES35VS DVD Recorder VCR combo, and they turned out to be true. It works great and it was fairly simple to learn how to use it. It is easy to use once you've read the documentation and done it just a couple of times.The best part for me is being free of VHS"
1,Dead in 6 months,"DVD drive stopped working after 6 months. Numerous reset attempts did not fix the problem. Drive makes a clunking noise, fails to read any discs, and still gives me ""NoREAD"" errors even when the tray is empty. This is the second Panasonic product I've recently had stop working so unless their customer service people are willing to bend over backwards, I'll be spending my money elsewhere forever."
1,believe the other reviews,"I read cautionary tales about this product and ignored them. Not only was it difficult (cumbersome) to use, but it is already busted after a couple of months. It was hyper sensitive. I am very disappointed b/c my whole goal was to take family vhs tapes and turn them into digital discs."
2,Jittery still images,I bought this item in May. First exchanged it and then returned it. My problem was jittery (shaky) images while watching a still picture and some animated movies (like South Park). The other problem mentioned in the other reviews about remote control is fixed now. You need to download the patch by use of a computer.It's a shame that an otherwise great product has a lot of bugs in it.
2,Couldnt make it go for long,"Hookup was a breeze.. I used a Cable splitter so I could bypass the unit when watching TV - My Sony TV has a better tuner.The unit played well with a fantastic picture with both VHS and a phenominal DVD image.. near HD on my regual set.It recorded well with only a slight loss in quality to bot DVD and VHS.The manual was a little confusing since there is So Much gadgetry this thing can do..I sat down to read it until I understood what it said FIRST, before getting frustrated.Once I had that down it's a very sweet unit for the price.HOWEVER, and thats a big HOWEVER - First try at transferring vhs to DVD TOASTED the laser and I had to return it for exchange.It was very nice of Panasonic to put in a error message that said"" U61(power interupted) Self check failed, refer to service""Thats the best thing when a unit quits..a message that states don't even bother to fiddle with it."
1,ATE MY VHS TAPE,"The first time I went to use this I put in a VHS tape to dub to dvd.Discovered the entire left side of the machine did not work and remote had no eject button. I called panasonic but everything they suggested involved hitting buttons on the nonfunctioning left side. They finally said I should take it to their repair shop 30 miles from my house. FORTUNATELY I had put in a tape with stuff I didn't care alot about- I'm just gonna return the dmr.My advise: any time you buy a new dvd player, recorder, or vhs put in a disc, or tape you don't care about when you are first trying it.By the way, I have no idea if any other parts worked/ or didn't work: I repacked it up immediately."
3,works ok but TOO complicated,"I have just really started to use this DVD recorder. It seems to work ok, but it is extremely complicated to use, and the manual is poorly organized with poor descriptors. Also, note they give you no instructions on connecting it to a DVR (i.e. ReplayTV or Tivo) so you need to call them - they were very helpful, however, on the phone.Anyhow, I am no newbie to tech stuff, but find this manual difficult to read, and the remote is anything but intuitive. In fact, the remote is downright terrible. This might be a good purchase for those who don't mind reading manuals cover to cover and going back to them from time to time. I am not that guy - I like to be able to plug it in, mess around with the remote and get going. If you are like me, this DVD recorder is probably not the one for you."
1,Very bad purchase!!!!!!!!!!,"Very bad purchase, I buy new DVD Panasonic in Amazon and when I arrive the reader from DVD not read any disc, none! i buys by Internet from Costa Rica and lost all the investment. Please no body buy this Model of Panasonic"
5,well writan,i am the grandson of mrs.reisman i am in the ankowledgements and helped make the book it is very good for coledge and highschool age people to help understand the lifes and books of southern men writers
5,One of the definative sarod records,"Ustad Ali Akbar Khan is one of the all time sarod legends. This four disc series makes it incredibly obvious why. If I could only have one set of Hindustani recordings, these four discs would be the ones. I just can't bring myself to rate any of them less than 5 stars. Get them all, you won't be sorry."
4,excellent anime,"Loved the anime, think ""planetes"" when you go to purchase this but as a precurser to the state of space development in the anime planetes."
2,it was the wrong size,sure it is the cologne i wanted but there is only one small size was with all of the normal 3.2 sizes. i ordered so quickly that i didnt realize that this was not the size i wanted and there is no way to return it. i will be more careful next time.
5,Great game!,"I loved the original Zoo Tycoon and this one was even better! Lot's of fun, you can ride through your exhibits and help care for the animals. Very fun! I wasn't very impressed with Marine Mania though. Too much money for not a lot of anything. But I would definately recommend the others!"
1,Will not open!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY,This is a very fun game and a great overall plot. It WILL NOT OPEN. I installed this game on a fairly new HP computer with a brand new graphics and sound card and plenty of memory. It opened the first two times and now it wont open at all. I tryed clicking on the icon and tried start and right clicking but it just wont work. Please Dont Waste Your Money.
1,Unable To Get Game To Open,"We have tried this game on 2 computers (one a fairly new Dell Laptop) and can get it to download but not open to play. We did get it to play once for about 1 hour, then after that were unable to. We have tried to call Microsoft and not been able to get much help. I read other comments that were similiar so know I am not alone. Anyone out there who was able to fix these problems on yours? If so please email me as my daughter really was looking forward to playing this and is so sad she has been unable too...thanks[...]"
1,Graphic,"Zoo Tycoon 1 is the best game ever. This game is expensive, requires a fancy graphics card (Though i seem to be the only one in the world without one) and a lot of memory. I could not get it to open.I haven't got a clue as to how fun this game is. Do not buy this game unless you are rich enough to buy a graphics card that costs that much."
5,Monkey Around,"Zoo Tycoon 2 is a game that is entertaining, educational and just downright fun. The object of the game is to build a world-class zoo. The game offers different terrains for you to explore. One must make the terrains comfortable and pleasing to the animals or they will get upset. Upset animals mean upset guests. Animals mate and give birth. You can sell animals or free them to the wild.Guests want to be entertained and their is a variety of ways to do that. From activities to kiosks, guest will spend money! They love to eat too!Build restaurants and food booths and don't forget the bathrooms!This game has no violence! No one gets killed except the animals from old age or when they fight which is seldom. I highly recommend this game."
5,The best Zoo Tycoon game yet!,"I love this game, I've had it since it came out, but had to buy a replacement after losing the install disc. There are so many new features in this game, including the jeep trails and sky trams that play is endless. The animal list goes on and on, and you can download a few new content from the zoo tycoon website. The graphics are really great, even on non gaming computers (which mine is far from a gaming computer!). I'd recommed this game to anyone who enjoys animals and making extremely lifelike and realistic habitats."
4,"A good book, for what it is","Whitlock is a columnist for the Kansas City Star, but has also written for ESPN and appeared on national television. This book is heavy on Kansas City and Big 12 Sports, but along the way there are interesting and provocative discussions of race, gender, and other ethical issues that permeate the world of sports. Jason is entertaining, makes you angry, but importantly also makes you think, which is why I like his writing."
1,Horrendous writing,"Is there anything more pathetic than an outclassed, illogical, brain dead ""journalist"" attempting to hook readers with senseless literary diarrhea? If you like WASTING YOUR MONEY, or just throwing it out the window cause you like feeling deprived, angry and fooled, please go ahead and BUY THIS BOOK! If you believe in quality journalism, writers who put in effort and research into and actually believe in their work, don't walk but RUN FROM this book, you'll thank me when you spend the 25 bucks on something more useful like toilet paper . . . actually, I wonder if you rip out the pages of this book and use them as TP, will they increase in value? Because I know they surely can't depreciate anymore.This is sensationalism journalism at its worst (best?). If the only way you can pull in viewers is by degrading a hard working athlete, or talking trash about a team, then you really need to re-evaluate your life goals and especially career because you just can't cut it."
1,Whitlock's writing is painfully horrible...,"The author knows nothing about what he writes about and he is part of today's ""shock"" journalism - making bad reporting even worse, and mis-leading the public. He doesn't do research, he expounds on points that are questionable without offering a counterpoint to rationalize his arguments.In my opinion, and obviously others, Whitlock is the best example of why I wish we DIDN'T have free speech in America. Maybe it should be free speech for everyone that's not a babbling idiot - lucky for us, Whitlock wouldn't make the cut."
1,I've seen more intelligent writing on a bathroom wall.,"For some reason, the musings of Jason Whitlock always remind me that I need to take a dump. I don't think Whitlock could take the pressure of writing a major book. Jason thinks that writing a column for ESPN is pressure. Does he not remember what happened to Larry Brown after he got all of those interceptions in the super bowl? No that does not make any sense, but neither does he."
1,Maybe his mom,"...loves him, but his ""journalism"" is sheer drivel. He doesn't research and he doesn't actually interview the people he writes about. He *literally* will write anything just to get a response. Don't waste your money on this!"
1,Not What I Expected,"Just like previous posters, I usually use water based lubricants because they are safe to use with the flesh light. I purchased KY Intrigue thinking that all of KY's products were water based and unfortunately I was wrong. It takes more lubricant to achieve the same effect as the water based blends that KY uses. After several applications I still experienced friction as if I did not use any lube at all. I recommend to stick to water based lubricants."
1,Save your money!,"Save your money and pass on this lubricant. It doesn't work with or without a condom. It's expensive and pretty much useless -- free saliva work better. It's sticky and doesn't glide well. I'm sure it would be worthless with toys as well, but I didn't try. It is hard to wash off afterwards as well. Pass on this and try something else, there are plenty of better lubes for less money!"
5,The best!,"""Intrigue"" is non-sticky and easy to use. A little dab'll do ya! Couldn't stand ""Silk"" as it was messy and way too sticky. Of course, it's 'to each his/her own...' and the same lube won't suit everyone."
5,Awesome product,This product is the best personal lubricant we have ever used. it doesn't get sticky like so many others do. It is a little more expensive than other lubricants but it is worth it.
1,Wothless waste of money...........,"I would give a 0 if amazon let me. Dries out way too fast and overpriced, The Wal-mart brand (Equate)of lubricant is 10 times better and cheaper than this garbage."
4,"I still prefer water based, but best silicone I've used","It definitely has a different feel than water based lubes, so if that's what you are used to this might be a shock. But a little goes a long way and it does last thru long sessions. I haven't tried it with toys yet so we'll see."
3,Slightly misleading,This book isn't what it sounds like at first glance. It is a view of video games from a literary criticism perceptive. Don't buy this if your interested in game design if you don't also have a passion for literary criticism.
2,Gabriel and Dresden,I was really disappointed in this cd. I was expecting the same type of music on the Bloom cd. This was more vocals and slow songs. I was expecting some great techno.
1,Horrible,"Perhaps one day people will learn not to purchase wasteful books. I cannot imagine the amount of calories people have wasted reading this, moving their eyes and allowing their brain to process the 'information.' What a disgrace."
1,It's a joke,"Author has a chip on her shoulder because she was insulted by animal activists who referred to hunters as ""murderers"". In general it's poorly written, biased and poorly researched. If you want a good laugh, read this book. The vast majority of animal activists are not hellbent on destroying humankind for the sake of non-human species-which the author tries to press this view that all activists are. While animal extremism does exist, as a whole these activist she's demonizing are compassionate folks to human and animal alike.Really..this book is a complete joke."
3,"Good, Not Great","Had I not read Mr. Sandford's PREY series first, I probably would have liked this book alot more. Anna, I found, was hard to warm up to. Creek did nothing for me at all. The who-done-it was pretty good, but the ending was a let down. So, it was ok, but try the Prey novels first."
2,Yawn,"I have a pet peeve regarding writers. This one has all the character using ""Ah"" or ""Aw"". Not everyone talks this way, so why do writers have to give the same voice to every character. I picked up this book a week ago because it's about my area and have yet to finish it. It seems the only books on the market these days are about preverts, mass murderers, physcos and whatnot. Everyone has a gun, everyone is hip, everyone is a lawyer driving expensive cars, and into golf. I am so upset. Where are the Dickens and Twain's of this age? It's an ok book but I certainly won't buy any more of his stuff. Call me disapointed."
2,"If you're a die-hard Lucas Davenport fan, Anna Batory pales!","The main problem I had with Anna Batory is that I did not especially like her. The concept of Sandford's heroine being in charge of a ""night crew"" which is a group of freelancers roaming the city in search of a story to sell, at any cost, with absolutely no moral sense of right or wrong in relationship to those personally impacted, does not suggest role model main character material to me. I want a hero I can, in my fantasy, hope to emulate. Anna does not make the grade. Therefore, it is truly fitting that she does not get her man in the end who represents everything she is not! Had I not been exposed to the ""Prey"" series and the Lucas Davenport character, I may not have been so disappointed"
1,Go Read Prey!,"The Night Crew is so different from Sandford's more famous ""Prey"" books. When I say ""different"", I mostly mean ""worse."" Not only is it an arduous read, but character development (which Sandford excels at with Lucas ""Prey Series"" Davenport) is weak and inconsistent. The red herrings are painfully obvious and the cop turned lawyer who still gets incredible access to crime scenes is ridiculous. I really don't understand what happened in The Night Crew as Sandford's regular series is consistently excellent."
2,"Skip this one and go to the ""Prey"" series.","If this were the first Sanford book I read, I would not read any of his other books. ""Night Crew"" lacks a sense of urgency, a coherent story line, and an interesting main charater. A let down from his other works."
2,Not Worth The Read,I didn't like the story at all. Anna Batory was a character that was just not believeable. Sandfords story started out slow and stayed that way till the end. The whole story about Batory was to predictable.
3,Quick weekend read,"I enjoyed the overall story in the Night Crew but felt the characters had very limited vocabulary and very limited emotional responses to situations. However, the book was a quick and easy read for a quiet weekend and did not involve any emotional input on my part."
1,Yuk- Rate Zero,"This story was so terrible it made me mad. I don't know why I didn't return it for an old book I really wanted ""From Here to Eternity"". I've turned in less bad books. The charcters were wooden and Creek was someone I'd never want to really meet. I guess he was slated to be some hunk lover dude but he's more like a dud. And then this Glass character who started out to be a tough chick cop ends up by Creek's bed side knitting (cucumber covers?) of all things. And Anna, the main character who gets beat up and is still able to hobble around has gotta be tougher than Zina or whatever that woman is that comes on Saturday nights. Near the end I just sped read to get through the crap. I bet the writer did this to make a fast buck, and I will NEVER read any of his other books. He must've had silver screen in his mind as we wrote this trash. Don't waste your time reading this junk, Huck Finn will make you so much happier!"
2,"Ok, but not great","The book was pretty good (not as good as the prey novels, or even the Kidd novels) up till the end, it has no closure for the characters, unless he plans to make another, i know there was a big gap between the Kidd novels. It wasnt written as well as the prey novels, and the characters werent as strong."
5,Good author. realistic,You always look forward to turning the page. I never want to stop and mark the spot for later reading.
3,For Sandford Fans,"Just finished ""The Night Crew,"" I've been a Sandford fan for years and this is not one of his best but an OK read. The job of the night crew roving Los Angeles searching for newsworthy events is exciting in itself but Sandford doesn't seem as comfortable in L.A. as he does in Minnesota and neither does the reader. Also, ""the Night Crew"" Lacks the police focus and viewpoint that Sandford is so good at as with Davenport and Flowers. Also, the development and insight into the life of the serial killer is lacking as compared to Sandford's other villians. If you are a true Sandford fan as I am you will want to read it. If you like Sandford try myHorseshoes & Nuclear Weapons (Attacks on America the Mike Hatch Terrorism Series)andTake It to the Limit"
1,A real letdown,"John Sandford really misses the boat on his latest novel. Although he continues his masterful writing and development of his characters, the plot of The Night Crew leaves a lot to be desired. I can remember rushing to get each of his books in the Prey series as they came out. But I really struggled to finish this one. I guess I am spoiled by the sheer genius of his previous works"
1,Too Many Loose Ends....,"This is totally a mediocre stuff from John Sandford...the story begins with a suicide jump and the video crew picturising it,this is followed by some more killings,some more false leads and what not.If John sandford thinks that he has kept the readers on the edge of their seats through out the book then he is totally wrong.When you come to the ending and find out who the killer is then you realise that almost three-fourths of the book does not lead you anywhere.There are so many loose ends and i could not find any connection between the suicide jump and the killer.Did the killer murder him or did he commit suicide..well who cares.I think John sandford should stick to Lucas Davenport character and his prey series ....avoid this book at any cost."
1,BIG Disappointment....,"I loved The Night Crew until I got 3/4 of the way through it. Sure some parts were kinda unbelievable (Jake barely grieving for his son; Pam just camping out at Creek's beside) but I put those things aside because I was thinking, ""Boy, this is building to an AWESOME climax! Is the killer Jake or Creek or someone else?"" I couldn't wait to find out. When I actually did find out, I was so angry that I could barely finish the book. I found out and didn't even care! It was just, for lack of a better literary term--stupid. Don't bother with this book. It took 4 hours out of my life that I'll never get back. Don't let the same happen to you."
2,Not the John Sandford to start with,"Fortunately, this was not the first John Sandford novel I've read. Had it been, I probably would never have discovered the delights of Sandford's ""Prey"" series, which is far more accomplished and enthralling.""Night Crew"" is about Anna Bantory who runs a free-lance TV crew that roams Los Angeles at night, gathering footage they hope to sell to television stations. One night, they tape a raid by animal activists. Coincidentally a call comes in that someone is on a hotel window ledge and may jump. Anna's crew records the jump.Hours later, someone murders a member of Anna's crew and off we go into the pursuit of a crazed killer who is obsessed with Anna.Ho-hum. The characters are thin, the plot contrived and the novel interminable. It's not a total waste of time, but there are many other cop-novels out there that are far more enjoyable, including Sandford's own ""Prey"" series, which I highly recommend.Jerry"
2,TALK ABOUT A STRANGE ENDING....,"John Sandford is obviously a prolific and talented writer, as evidenced by the success of his Lucas Davenport ""Prey"" series. However, with ""The Night Crew,"" I have to wonder why all the hoopla? Granted, this book has a very interesting and unusual premise---following a bunch of ""reporters"" who film unusual or bizarre accidents/murders/arsons, as they occur. The main character, Anna, is sympathetic and you can relate to her, in some ways. The book's best character, Jake, the ex-cop, is also quite different and interesting.Alas, however; the plot gets so confusing and the identity of the murder is so ""convenient,"" yet unexplained. The ending, both in regards to what occurs with Anna and Jake's relationship, and Creek's strange visit to Anna's ex-boyfriend, is just frustrating. No closure!Now, if Sandford intends a series, this ending might work, but if he doesn't, he's robbed the reader of the all-important resolution of vital closure. A real disappointment."
3,"Not Sandford's best, but still a good read","Anna is an interesting character; she's complex, tough yet likeable. The story is a thriller, with a good amount of suspense and tension. I enjoyed the bits of dark humour and the well written dialogue.This book is not quite as good as those in Sandford's 'Prey' series, but it is worth reading. I'd look forward to another book in this series."
2,Unbelievable! ... and I mean that literally,"I too am a fan of ""The Prey Series"" and can't believe this book is by the same author. There were so many things that were unbelievable and stupid in this book that you will just start shaking your head. I would have to say at the top of my list is that the main character lets a man she has met once move in with her to protect her... come on. I'll let you guess what happens next. The climax was anticlimactic as a three year old child could see through the so called ""trap"" the villian fell into. If you want true enjoyment in a novel BAINE KERR'S HARMFUL INTENT is the best courtroom thriller I've ever read, buy that not this garbage."
3,"Not as good as ""Prey"" series.","When compared to other works of Sandford's, this book is disappointing. Standing on it's own, its not terrible but certainly is not great. The plot is choppy and leaves many loose ends. The characters though not completely unlikable, don't come across as interesting to the reader. The ending is terrible with huge loose ends at which point you usaully want to know if there is another book to let you know how it comes together in the end. If there is another book, I wouldn't read it."
2,Confusing and disappointing,"I read ""The Night Crew"" while waiting for the latest Prey novel to come out in paperback. If this is any indication of his non-Lucas material, I won't be in a hurry to check out his Kidd series.Normally, I think Sandford is a great storyteller who writes with clarity. This book is just sloppy. I had a very hard time figuring out what was happening and why.Also, none of the characters or their relationships really ring true, except for Anna's platonic relationship with her second-in-command of sorts, Creek.It's a quick read, and it's not totally horrid, but I would recommend it only as a last resort if you're the type that absolutely has to have something to read and this is all you can find."
1,WAY Too Obvious!,"I LOVE mysteries and I am a fan of Sanford's ""Prey"" books but this was a pile of junk! I'm the type of person who doesn't try to guess ""whodunnit"" throughout the book - I just get swept away. Well, I didn't have to guess - the answer was so obvious the suspense was non-existent. I never have any idea who the killer is and I knew this one on about page 60! I'm just mad I finished the entire book to find out I was right all along..."
3,brisk,"John Sandford isn't the best writer around & he's not the greatest plotter around. But he's one of the most interesting mystery writers around because his stories take place at the intersection between the police & the news media. Half the fun of his Lucas Davenport series lies in watching Davenport use leaks to manipulate the media to his own ends.In this new series, Sandford gives us a sort of guerilla news crew. They roam the streets of LA at night & catch incidents on video tape, then sell them to the Networks. One night they film an animal liberationist raid on a lab and a drug addled youth jumping from a ledge. In short order someone starts attacking & killing members of the video crew. Is it connected to one of the videos they shot? connected to both?Sandford moves the story along briskly & he's created several likable characters who seem certain to pop up in future books.GRADE: C+"
4,An exciting thriller,"I decided to review this because of so many pans. While I enjoy the Prey series, I found this as good as many of those. I think series often run out of steam and its good for the author to work with new characters. I found the heroine to be a strong and interesting character and the book an exciting read. My only complaint is that the ending wasn't as strong as I hoped. Other personal favorites are Connelly, Hiaasen, and Raymond Chandler for American. LeCarre, Rendell, and Charles Todd for the Brits."
5,The Night Crew by John Sandford,"The book was great, and in perfect condition, plus I recieved it in a very timely manner. I could not have been more pleased."
4,Anna Batory deseerves a sequel,"I have not read anything else by this author but definately will. This book was very enjoyable and kept my interest through the entire reading. Anna Batory deserves a sequel. She is a great heroine. Reading this book, I was wondering who would play her in a movie version of this story. The only thing I would change about this book...It could have ended about 2 pages sooner."
1,The Night Screw,"Sandford's ""Prey"" series are all good to great thrillers. ""The Night Crew"" is garbage. He's written this totally politically correct novel(i.e. a super strong woman, weak guy as a love interest) hoping to interest a Hollywood leading lady into pushing the book into a script and a movie.(My opinion, of course). The book is implausable to the max. Enjoy the others in the ""Prey"" series, but skip this one."
3,fast-paced but superficial,"John Sanford knows how to keep a story moving, and his characters get into some exciting situations, but I don't really think it was that involving of a mystery or as original a plot as I thought it was going to be. The Empress File sure sounds good, though."
4,The Night Crew,I gotta say that this book is a true thriller.It wasn't as good as the Prey books but it satisfied me.I was pretty much left in the dark for the entire story.Sandford could've been a little easy on the swearing.Over all this book was great and I think that he deserves plenty of credit for his effort.Took me a while to read.
3,Not as good as the original,"I was disappointed in ""Take Me Home"" as opposed to the original ""Celtic Thunder"" but mostly it was because of the way they had to work the original ensemble numbers around Damian's deep voice. The last part of ""Heartland"" was done by Ryan since they still needed a tenor and Damian did most of the solo work on ""Steal Away"" that had previously been done by Paul. It was a shock to hear Damian as a baritone instead of a tenor, but I got used to it.Frankly I'm glad they gave him more mature teenage numbers to do. ""Puppy Love"" and ""Young Love"" on the previous DVD were just silly.All in all it was pretty good, but not as good as the original."
3,Good but not great,"I enjoyed Celtic Thunder the show very much and have watched it many times. This new video is good, but contains far to many songs that were on the first video with out improving on any of them. I do not know if it is because I have heard them so many times or what, but in almost every case I prefer the other video.Damion's voice has changed, as of coarse it should,but I much prefer A BIRD WITHOUT WINGS, in the first video over this one.If you enjoyed the the show on the first video you will most likely enjoy this one, but next time I hope they have some new material."
1,Take me home,I Love Ct but when i got this dvd it was ruined the picture was shaking all around and you could not watch it at all. But the plus side is the sound is wonderful. I also have the cd which it awesome. I had to purchase a new one and hope that is it not the same way.
1,Waste of Money,"The first DVD was excellent. This DVD is terrible. Although slightly entertaining, it did not look or sound as though it were professionally done. The audio was monotone - no volume change in singing emotions. This made the entire show boring to watch. Keith has a southern drawl in his sound and really is not as ""hot"" as he thinks he is. Teeny bopper songs were OK for Damian a couple of years ago but he's a little too big for the ""Cutesy"" songs all the time, not to mention that his voice is getting too deep for it all. The follow-up DVD, ""It's Entertainment"", is a little better. It is more of a variety show setting, but the audio is still pretty much the same volume throughout. Losing the emotional feeling of the songs in the audio makes this DVD a total waste."
3,Why?,"First, I am a great Celtic Thunder fan but..........this DVD is very disappointing. The vocals are their usual quality but the mix is terrible. The instrumentals overpower the vocals. The new songs are too few. I have all of their other DVDs and CDs, so I don't want to hear them sing the same songs on this one. This is not ""The best of"". This is not even close to the quality of their other productions. Maybe a rush to produce something, huh?"
2,"Great group, bad DVD","I love this group. Utter love. That's why it was so depressing to see this production. As one reviewer said, it was like a bad college film maker tried. Camera quality is horrid, lighting is laughable, and they kept panning to the audience who seemed to be bathed in blacklight. I'd much rather have the CD. I couldn't bare to watch such horrible filming again."
5,Celtic Thunder's next BEST!!,This one was even better than their first one. Damian is so precious and maturing. I love his songs and his performances. The reminder of the group is wonderful as well. These 5 guys truly compliment each other.
5,Loved it! Loved them! A great performance!,After seeing the PBS performance I can say this DVD is recommended to all Celtic Thunder fans or those who are new to the group and looking for a wonderful new group. Each member can put on a show alone when they do a solo but when they sing together it's a powerful thing that no one should miss. I can't wait for this DVD release.
2,Don't know what to say ...,"I went wild for the first Celtic Thunder DVD, and I was unbearably disappointed in this one. George lost his dignity, Keith looked like he'd rather be anywhere else, Ryan looks like he's lost a ton of weight, Damien's voice has changed and is lovely - but I prefer the younger version, and Paul was the only one who looked like he was having fun. There is way too much American folk and pop rock in it. You buy something ""Celtic"" you expect to hear Irish and Scots tunes. The delivery of the music is what it always is with these guys - amazing."
2,WHAT HAPPENED??!!,"I am a lover of Celtic Thunder, I love every one of them, but I have to agree with the first review. I thought the dvd was a complete rush job and it clearly showed, after watching the first dvd they did, then watching this, is not only insulting but very disappointing as well. I would reccommend the first dvd NOT this this one. I sincerely hope their 3rd dvd ""Celtic Storm"" coming out in the Spring of 2010(March)will re-enstate my love for these guys & show that the time and effort was taken into consideration for their fans"
2,Celtic Thunder - Take Me Home,I do not like this product and would like to return it. Oregon Public Broadcasting showed this same program before I opened this. It does not have any original songs or different songs than other DVD's and CD's by Celtic Thunder. Please let me know if I can return the unopened package.
3,"Great Groups, Shoddy DVD","Many of the reviews here pre-date the DVD release - let me step in to say that the guys are awesome - saw the concert, own the 3 CDs & 2 DVDs. BUT, this DVD is marginally different from the previous one. If you're a fan, you're going to buy this anyway, like I did, but if you're just getting into the group, opt for disc one and skip this one until something more worthwhile is produced."
1,Really low budget nothing for a huge price,"I purchased Celtic Woman, Eastern Energy and Celtic Thunger 2 at the same time. The family heritage is Scotch/Irish. We have Tatoo, Riverdance.........all wonderful productions. This no talent nothing production was a rip off. We loved Eastern Energy (12 girls band) and Celtic Woman. Showed this to my wife's Parents who are Scoth/Irish and they were also very disappointed. If you are going to try this group get a different DVD than Celtic Thunder 2. I have not nor will I see their other DVD's so I can only comment on this one. I feel really plundered at the ridiculous price I paid. If I could return it I would. I will instead donate it to our local Library."
4,Celtic Thunder-Take Me Home,We enjoy the performances of Celtic Thunder but were surprised that so many of the songs were repeats of the previous album.
3,I thought this was a new product. I have the CD and would not have bought this also.,The music and the repetion of the singers choreography was not very good. This seemed like a dark movie.
2,very disappointed,"Take Me HomeI pre ordered both the DVD and CD before they were released because we are enthralled with this group. My whole family was disappointed with the quality of this DVD--the camera angles, poor sound quality, and the editing was horrid. I couldn't believe the things that were not edited out which made this look like the group was just suffering through a performance with a bad crowd. They even showed one guy in the audience yawning. One member of CT made the comment,""Come on Rama, you can do better than that!"" when they were trying to involve the crowd. The guys seemed to have no energy or passion (overall). I am surprised that someone involved with the groups image would approve the release of a DVD of this quality."
4,celtic thunder,a live concert that picks up where the original show and cds left off with some new songs and great tunes that will keep you entertained and gives you the feeling of being there with a front row seat.It's Great
4,new fan of Celtic Thunder,"This is a great group of young men with different vocal ranges and styles. They all blend in for a fantastic sound. Songs range from pop tunes, entertainment classics, original compositions from the members, to celtic music."
3,Agree 100% with Romantic Fiction Addict,"My wife and I are Celtic Thunder fans extraordinare! We bought five of the first DVD ""The Show"" and gave some of them as gifts. We also talked it up to friends and family who also loved it. The newest DVD was eagerly awaited but a super disappointment. The DVD itself was very poorly done, the camera shots were jerky and unprofessional, the lighting was foggy, etc. We still love the guys and would like to see one of their public concerts. Hopefully they will agree with us and come up with a new DVD worthy of their talents!"
3,A Little Disappointed,"I am a great admirer of Celtic Thunder and get great pleasure from their first DVD. I looked forward with great anticipation to the ""Celtic Thunder Take Me Home"" DVD but when it arrived and I viewed it, it was somewhat of a letdown.I expected a whole new show with perhaps some of the songs performed on the first DVD but I found mostly old performances and not many new ones. Out of the twenty nine songs on the DVD I believe only ten were different. I felt as if I were looking at the first show.However, there is no such thing as a ""bad"" Celtic Thunder performance and I enjoyed the show nevertheless. James Heflin"
5,Help I would like a copy,I would like a copy of this video if anyone can help please e-mail me wit where and how much$$
1,Fantasy!,"This book is not accurate. Billie makes statements about many people who cannot defend themselves against her accusations. My mother, Karen,and step-father, Edgar (Billie's first husband), passed away in 1978. I lived through part of this book. When Billie's daughter came to live with us she had welts on her backside and hair missing from her head which she attributed to abuse from Billie! OH and the stories she told of life with Billie and her husband Frank! AND, my mother was a proud woman who would have never confided in Billie!"
2,Misleading,"As I now notice other people have mentioned, this is very misleading. It's not two dolls, it's the front and back view of one doll."
4,Bought for a gift,My aunt is an art teacher and loves Bop N' Beep. I bought this for her birthday. It appears to be exactly what is listed and exactly what she wanted. I know she will love it.
5,Sony Replacement for NP-FS11,The new Sony battery NP-FS12 is a replacement for NP-FS11. It is much better
1,Kitsch Deluxe,"Disappointment. Just another coffee table book. Writing is shallow, nothing is new from other Kitsch books. Best part of writing is on the dust cover. Color pictures are colorful, but all Kitsch books have been already used these pictures. Nothing is fresh looking. If you are looking for a coffee table book to cheer up your room, it is OK. Just not for me. Or don't be fooled by the dust cover writing, which sounds like little more than other Kitsch books."
2,too littleof what the title promises,"Both of the other reviews do a good job in telling you why not to but this DVD... the producers of these DVDs have actually edited out all of the actual ""Camp"" lectures and classes and left you with only a very basic overview of what the camp was to offer the participants. If you know that the ""Reality Camp"" cost over $3000 and bought the DVD's hoping to get some of the classes on DVD from the camp, there really aren't any. The talk Howard gives on how he developed as a player from being nearly homeless in New York to playing in some of the biggest games in Las Vegas with Doyle Brunson and Chip Reese is probably the redeeming value in this set but just be aware the classes have been edited out so you get close to no poker instruction."
3,To complicated,"There aren't a ton of recipes, and you have to have a certain type of pot to cook certain meals. While it is ambitous, it's not the best general clay pot cooking book out there"
2,"Great idea, doesn't work","I bought this item thinking it would be an easy way to record interviews and take notes at the same time. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work. The buttons are very small, and don't work as the instructions describe. The voice recording device is temperamental to say the least, and there's no warranty so I am out of luck. While the item was not horribly expensive, any amount for a non-functional unit such as this is too much.Effectively, I've got an extra flash drive. But as for the recording part, well, forget it. I'm back in the market for a functional and compact digital recorder."
3,monogram angora gloves,"the color seemed faded and the monogram yellowed to me but my cousin says she likes them, and she wanted light blue and thats what she got, she liked that they were long, that they covered her wrists."
2,Easy Listening,"This is not a CD to put on and ""dig your teeth into"". Frankly it is somewhat boring. It is best suited for back ground music at best. There are no real instumental explorations. Just a bunch of short songs with alot of vocls,nothing to get excited about."
1,Poor Listing and Poor Shippment,"When i ordered this Item I made sure to double check and make sure I ordered the right item. The listing is decieving because it says pants and shirts, you dont get both your suppose to select top or bottom and size, so you have to make sure you choose corectly which I did. I selected the regular length top and when my order shipped I recieved a pair of pants. The shipper insisted I made the error of ordering the wrong item, which I know for a fact I didnt. Bottom line is the listing is decieving even to the shipper. If you buy any one of these items pants or shirts your just taking a gammble on just that, you will either recieve a pair of pants or a shirt. Poor listing and poor shippment, Waste of time."
4,Goku Dies!,"After Cell relizes he will lose, he becomes a bomb and says the planet will explode with him. Goku uses instant transmission and brings cell to king kias place. Cell reappears at Earth after he killed Goku, King Kai, and Bubbles to announce he can regenerate with one cell left. He also says because of his sayain blood, he gets stronger after every near-death experience! Can Gohan defeat this menace?"
3,ehh...,"We used this textbook for one of my MSW classes. While it had important information to relay to us, I've had better textbooks. It was a bit stiff in its writing. Definitely did not hold my attention. It was ehh...okay. Not the worst. Not the best."
5,Bobby B Tops himself with newest album,THe entire album is full of fresh energy and flavor! Bobby has changed his aproach and style ans allowed it to flow in this awesome beatmart recording. Check out bobbys website at www.bobbybishop.com
3,"It's Great in some places, but it's dull in others...","I have listened to the whole Enchilada like 3 times and I'm still not really impressed or really happy- maybe it's because I'm just off of listening to the L.A. Symp all the time, but Bobby B doesnt seem to have the high production levels and rhyme skills that some of the other rappers do. Some songs are great, such as ""The Laudromat"" but others feel like hip-hop junk... like they are there to fill the disk. And he mentions Beatmart records a little too much.I dont mind having bought the CD, and I don't regret the purchase.I do give the dude props for all he does, but this CD is certainly only worth the $9.95 and not any more. If you like Bobby Bishop buy it- if you don't even know who he is, it's not gonna hurt you to have skipped this album."
5,Anyone can become an accordionist!,"I play a 120 bass Piano Accordion and I saw this toy accordion and it just stole my heart. It's a sturdy little diatonic accordion and it's beautifully tuned in chords so you can't play a wrong note. It's a load of fun, and when my friends say they can't play music--- I hand them this little axe and they have a blast! It's compact, beautiful, and a load of fun for anyone of any age!"
5,good durable toy,"We have now had it for over 2 years and between 4 kids and their many friends and cousins, it still lives! Whenever it is found it is played with. Yeah sure the keys get stuck occasionally, but if that happens you just wiggle the end a little bit and presto everything goes back. Worth the money!"
2,Disappointing,"To be fair, this is really marketed as a toy, and as such, is probably worth the price, but I don't think it merits the effusive superlatives in many of the reviews. It's hard to get anything out of it except noise. The left hand reeds are so far off of the advertised C and G tuning, and so mismatched to the right hand reeds as to be irritating. Most frustrating is the inconsistent difficulty getting any sound out of some of the reeds unless you push or pull so hard that you use up all the air on one short note.This might be fun for a 3 year old who just wants to make some noise on a colorful box, but if you are hoping to introduce a youngster to the joy of playing a simple tune, you and your budding musician will be disappointed."
3,Best for squeezin',"This isn't a bad accordion.Pros:doesn't sound badcheapfun(?)Cons:the bellows creak/ make crunchy noisesit leaks air, and doesn't have much breathThis accordion works best when you just randomly push buttons. You probably wouldn't want to spend much time trying to learn actual songs on it. You can get about 1 um pa pa per inhale/exhale while pushing the melody keys."
3,ok,"the levitron is really hard to learn. it has to be extremely level with whatever it's standing on and the washers are easy to lose. I shook the levitron and there's space inside of it and there's one spot in it that attracts the top the most that probably makes it worse. It will be hard to learn, but its still pretty cool. sucks and hard to learn."
1,A frustrating disaster,"This device sounds nice and the pictures of it in operation are impressive. Too bad that had *nothing* to do with the product. I don't care how carefully you read the directions and how dexterous you are, you will *not* be able to float the magnetic top over the base. Imagine hours of frustration and disappointment followed by stuffing this turkey in a drawer forever more. That is the Levitron experience. It may possibly work if your order the optional starter wand. If so it should be part of the standard product. As delivered, the Levitron is a complete fraud. Fortunately for me, this was a trivial side gift that everyone could laugh at when it became clear what a waste it was. If this had been a primary gift, it would result in disappointment and embarrassment."
4,Don't buy the little helper gizmo it doesn't spin it fast at all...,"This is a neat little toy that is a pain in the you know what to get to work right. They offer a helper gizmo that is supposed to make it easier, but the gizmo doesn't spin it fast enough...a waste of $10."
5,Amazing levitation,I saw this on you tube and was impressed. I ordered it through Amazon.com and the Levitron came quickly.My initial try at levitation was not successful..... I takes some experimenting to get the correct weight setting for your location and magnet strengths. Once the correct weight is determined it is easy to get the top to levitate. Very fun to show to people who have never seen one.
3,Quality control problems,The company needs to check Quality Control a bit closer:When the Levitron Cherry arrived I immediately tried to use the device but noticed that no combination of weights worked. Then I noticed that the magnet assembly had seperated from the wooden case and the plastic bottom ring was also loose.I had to reseat the ring and used some 5 minute epoxy to glue the plastic ring to the bottom to keep the magnet from falling out again.The 2 yellow plastic weights were missing so I ended up making some appropriate weights out of a plastic coffee can lid.The bobbin is operating correctly. Its a good thing I am a tinker. I'm pleased with my repairs.
5,Best child seat ever !,"I have 12 grand children. They have all liked riding with me on my bike, but I never felt quite comfortable having a child behind me not knowing what he was doing and not being able to talk to him and discuss things we'd see along the way.The HAMAX seat is WONDERFUL. As soon as my grand daughter comes through the door she asks to go for a ride.I love having her in front of me. Now we can talk and sing together as we ride. She can see where we are going instead of looking at my back.The great thing is that it is easy to install and remove.Thanks for bringing this seat to the USA.Siv Sandin-Lane"
4,good seat,I've had both front and back bike seats for children and the front seat is hands down better. The child's view is unobstructed. You have a better feel of how your child is doing without having to look back. One drawback to this seat specifically is that it does not fit some bicycle designs. It does not clamp to my wife's cruiser bike.
2,Doesn't Fit My Bike,"I am disapointed in this product. It doesn't fit my bike (REQUIRES 2"" FREE SPACE BETWEEN TOP & BOTTOM BARS ON FRAME) which is a pretty standard women's bike. Even if it mounted to my bike, the seat back hits me in the chest and my knees hit the bottom. It also makes steering difficult which poses a huge safety risk for everyone involved.This seat may work for a tall thin person with the right bike, but it doesn't fit us."
4,Good buy,It is very sticky and works almost same as 3M. unknown brand name but good packing tapes. I have had no problem with this one..
3,Duck Brand Tape,"I thought that this tape would be similar to the tape we used at work, however, it is NOT. It tears rather easily and then it is a nightmare to ""find"" the tape once it has adhered itself back onto the roll. Stick with name brands that have been around forever! I will next time.....learned my lesson the frustrating way!"
4,Good tape.,"We have had very good luck with this tape and will purchase it again when we run out.The tape does not tear in the wrong place and is plenty sticky enough to seal the packages.The only downside is that the cost is somewhat higher than I expected to pay. However, I think this is a case of getting what you pay for."
1,Terrible quality cheapo tape AVOID,"I've been using packaging tape for years with my business shipping and receiving department. This is the worst quality tape there is. This is great if you want very thin, very cheap tape. But if you care about what you're mailing, or if you want the tape to actually seal cartons if you are moving or something, stay away from this stuff. It doesn't hold up over time, and it doesn't keep packages closed, let alone sealed tight. t's like the old celophane tape from the 1960s that turned yellow, etc. Very, very thin. Not good for mailing shipments. To be avoided."
1,Cheap tape is cheap tape.,"I bought this tape at Walmart because in comparison to 3-M shipping tape, it was cheaper. I should have bought the expensive tape. This tape tears very easily. Nothing is more annoying than pulling and stretching out a nice long piece of tape for shipping and have it tear. There you are pulling and tugging, expecting a nice, wide strip of tape and you get a piece of tape that is super-skinny on the end and wide at the bottom and so, of course, useless, and you have to start over but then you can't find where the tape ends so you're running your finger over the roll trying to find the end of the tape and you claw at it like a starving raccoon until you find it and start the taping process all over again. Aaargh! I'll stick (no pun intended) with the pricier brand thank you very much..."
1,Don't get this tape if you value your sanity,"I can't believe this tape has any good reviews. I sell a lot online so I use packing tape a lot, and this was what I happened to grab at the store the last time I needed to buy more tape. I've just now thrown away my remaining half of a roll because I can't take it anymore. Whenever it stuck back onto itself on the roll rather than being held apart by the dispenser (which was almost every time I used it), and I would try to pull it up, it would split into several tiny strips and took about 5 minutes to get it back to one cohesive whole. To keep it from further splitting and to even SEE where the strips were was near impossible. And after all that, it doesn't even stick very well. They must have changed the quality of the product since those 5-star reviews were written, or maybe I got a bad batch. All I can say is, get any other brand but this!!"
5,Thick Sticky Packaging Tape Better Than Scotch Brand,"This was my first purchase of this product, I had been using the USPS and Scotch brand packing tape previously for the past 33 years.No comparison. Duck brand was thicker, clear and only required one swipe to seal the box. Scotch brand needed 2-3 swipes of tape. The Duck brand is about twice as thick and it is obviously crystal clear (see attached picture).Cost breakdown per roll:this item: .172 cents per yardlarger rolls of the Duct product packaging tape: .127 cents yardScotch: .198 yard"
2,Disapointed,I have been using the Scotch brand for years and based on other reviews decided to try the Duck brand.There were a few issues with the tape with the first being it didnt stick to the cardboard boxes I was sealing. The tape kept coming off so I ended up having to tape the tape to get it to stick.In other words very frustrating.The second problem was the tape would tear very easy down the middle. So when the tape was cut or being used to seal the box I would end up with two strips.Overall I feel the quality of the tape including lack of thickness and lack of being able to stick to cardboard merits a two star rating.
2,Do NOT Buy if Buying to Cover Labels for Mailing,"I run a business where I use a Dymo label printer. I ship out packages and put said label on the package which is simply a mailing cardbox box. Specifically USPS flat rate boxes.This tape, placed over the label, *fades the ink so it cannot be read*. I've tested this after noticing the problem both indoors and outdoors. I think the tape magnifies the sun outside and fades the ink from heat.However, the same problem happens indoors (just more slowly).I've used other tape without problems. So if you are buying this tape specifically to cover labels to ensure they do not get damaged when mailing, try another product because this tape actually causes the damage."
5,Much better than 3M,"I purchased some of the 3M heavy duty tape. I, like so many others, found that it didn't stick. Whether that was a QC issue or what I don't know, but I wasted money and decided to try this. I'm glad I did. It's not as thick so it's easier for my cheap tape dispenser to cut without shredding. It is plenty thick for its intended use I feel. In my opinion this tape is the clearest of all the tapes I've used. This product sticks well and is a great value with subscribe and save."
5,Quality tape but these packs are getting harder to find,"Yes, this tape is extremely strong and works well in most places but it is getting harder to find them in a set of 6 without paying a lot for them. They are for a decent price here on amazon but when you do find them and that is if you do find them in the stores they can be very pricey."
1,Horrible......just horrible......,"A comedy? A drama? A ""dramedy""? Somehow this film manages to avoid being any of the above. It's just.....bad. This is one of those little unpleasant flicks that manages to have not even one likable character in it. Every plot line is downbeat, every situation is irrational and overwrought, and every line of dialogue strained, especially the parts that are supposed to pass for comic relief. You simply want to smack several characters in the head for being so stupid. There was a really good idea at the core of this movie, but it missed the mark in every possible way."
1,... for no one.,"The one critic's quote on the jacket of this DVD came from a RADIO source, which should have been my first clue before bothering to open it, and it couldn't have been further from the truth. If this movie is ""Smart, funny, frank, really well written - really funny,"" either this critic is into payola or needs to confine herself to critiquing AUDIO. The entire movie was dull, the dialogue was consistently tedious and inane, and only 1 male character out of the bloated cast was even worth looking at. And if this is an example of the ""Best Canadian Film"", I'll never buy another one. A total waste of money and time. I threw it into the trash."
2,Disappointed,"This movie was not all that great at all. I bought it because I have a passionate love for Mark Hildreth and that should be the only reason anyone should see this movie. The plot was flawed, the acting was lacking, the dialogue was slow, and the characters were extremely under-developed. I was extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend anyone buy it. Rent it if you want to see it, but it is definately not worth purchasing."
1,Depressing and disappointing,"A cast of depressive characters and disappointing gay stereotyping allwrapped in one film. A potentially wonderful plot device turns sour asa string of dark scenarios unfold. Few comic moments followed byrepeated diatribes from unsympathetic characters. I was ready for afresh approach to the subject matter, but was sorely disappointed bythe contrived script which reduced both character and plot todepressing clichés. I had hoped the days were over when Hollywoodviewed gay characters with such obvious disdain and stereotyping.Theonly standout performance is by the kooky mother whose love for her gayson was refreshing and funny."
1,Movie for Suckers for Punishment,I must be a sucker for punishment because I actually sat through the whole movie while hating every moment of it. The acting is not good! Neither is the screenplay. It's difficult to sympathize with anyone in this movie.
3,TRICKY MARKETING BY PUBLISHER- + Dishonest,"Well I just received my book and come to find out it is the exact same book I already own under a different name + graphics. This book is originally titled ""Trialogues at the edge of the west"".I would not have bought this book if I knew I already owned it. I find the publisher, Park Street Press, completely dishonest for not informing the ""would be buyer"" what this book really is.I was friend's with one of the authors, Terence mckenna, and I find this to be just another way for corporations and individuals to capitalize on his death-such a shame."
1,Lofty-sounding but vacuous,"A more appropriate title for this book would be ""Three Pretentious Fools Talking About Things They Know Nothing About."" The book is composed entirely of vacuous but lofty-sounding rhetoric and New-Age style cosmic speculations, and is remarkable for its almost complete lack of intellectual content. It reminds me of the kind of pseudo-intellectual discussions I used to have in the dorm with my college buddies after we'd each had several beers."
4,MULTIDIMENSIONAL AND DISTURBING,"I can understand why Joe Roth's FREEDOMLAND didn't do well at the box-office. The movie gets onto so delicate subjects as race problems or infanticide that it was doomed to be rejected by a certain amount of people. Before everything, FREEDOMLAND is a movie about loss : loss of a child for Julianne Moore and Karen Collucci, loss of a child and loss of his people's trust for Samuel L. Jackson. The smart screenplay generates enough flesh around this theme to withhold the audience's attention during 100 minutes. As for the performance of the actors, Julianne Moore would have deserved an Academy award for the personnification of Brenda Martin, a woman whose destiny gives to FREEDOMLAND a Tragedy status.A DVD zone important matters."
2,Uh-oh!,"This is a muddled mess of a movie, although it seems promising at first. A mother is dragged from a car and her young son is left behind, to be driven off in the car by the hijackers.Unfortunately, everything goes downhill from here. There are plot lines that go nowhere and long pieces of the story that don't seem to connect to other parts. Even worse, the mother isn't treated in a believable way by the police. She may be in danger but they actually leave her alone at certain points.Anyway, it was just a jumbled hodge podge of a movie. Deeply regretted seeing it. Liked the book, though."
1,Are you kidding me?,"This movie was absolutely awful. Laughable. I progressively got angrier at Julianne Moores character. The woman goes through the movie in an absolute daze. She was so pathetic. So overacted. The movie started off great and then became a lame mess. I kept waiting for some kind of climax or resolution. Some ""twist"" that would make the 2 hours of life I gave up watching this piece of junk meaningful, but to no avail. I can't believe movies like this get made, and I waste my time watching them."
3,IT WAS VERY HARD TO WATCH,"THIS MOVIE WAS VERY HARD TO WATCH. IT WAS VERY SAD, VERY DEPRESSING, VERY CHAOTIC, VERY VIOLENT, AND, AT TIMES, NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FOLLOW. I DON'T THINK IT WAS A VERY REALISTIC OR BELIEVEABLE MOVIE. SAMUEL L. JACKSON DID TURN OUT A PRETTY GOOD PERFORMANCE BUT I DID NOT CARE FOR JULIANNE MOORE IN THIS MOVIE. (OR ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER.) I WOULD NOT WATCH IT AGAIN AND I DO NOT RECCOMEND IT UNLESS YOU HAVE A VERY LONG ATTENTION SPAN AND A HIGH TOLERNACE FOR VIEWING VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATIONS & VERY DISTURBING SCENES. IT WAS JUST A BIT TOO FAR OUT THERE AND WAY TOO VIOLENT AND RADICAL FOR ME. THAT IS MY OPINION ANYWAY."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,"I've seen grade school plays that flow better than this movie. Interesting subject matter but all over the place with poor acting and several loose plots running at the same time. The worst movie I've ever seen, hands down."
2,Decent but Could Have Been Better,"I had been wanting to see this movie for a long time and I finally got around to watching it and it was a big let down for me. The plot just wasn't original enough for me. It felt like a plot and a movie I had seen and heard of often before which for me is boring when it seems like a repeat or copy cat type movie. Julianne Moore's acting was great and Samuel L. Jackson was pretty good also so for me the problem wasn't the acting but just the story. I enjoy Jackson's acting but I feel like he too often takes every role presented to him and I think there would have been better movies for him to do than this one. Overall it's a decent movie, it's not a movie I would likely watch again but it's a movie worth seeing once."
1,Brutal: find your own copy in the bargain-bin,"Awful. That one word could sum up this entire movie. How did a movie with such good actors and initially promising plot run off the tracks this dramatically? Essentially this movie is proof that if doesn't matter who you cast in a movie if the plot and script are poor. Plot holes, jumpy storyline, and a conclusion that is laughable make this one of the worst 'crime drama' genre movies I've ever had the misfortune of watching.1.5/5 stars. Not even worth the cost to rent, much less buy. Possibly useful by the corrections department to soften hardened criminals or to get witnesses to talk."
1,Not very original,"Was it yesterday that i saw this on the news? Maybe it was last month, no,,,i take it back it was 6 days ago i'm sure i saw this on the 6 o'clock news. Basically what i'm saying is it just reminded me of everyday life living in America. A sick story is a sick story real or created. Maybe we are getting to use to all the violence and hatred that America has become and so this movie almost turns into a comedy. Besides, when i go to the movies i just want to escape all the horrible things that are going on in the world and be entertained. Not to give the person sitting next to me an idea. We're living in bad-enough times already without having to see more of it on the big screen."
4,"Wait , you may like it.","Freedom Land was not a bad movie by any means. I say this because the director tried to incorporate major social issues into this film.Yes, the movie is based upon a reported car jacking however from there you enter into a neighborhood that is overridden with racial animosity and the lack of unity between the people and the police department. The plot is heightened with the collision of two separate worlds and the inability for a mother to make sense of how she has been placed in the middle of all of it.I thought Freedom Land was a good movie because it described how your life can go from normal to erratic in a matter of hours. This is the kind of movie you have to make a personal judgement on because it may reach some but others may just view it as another ""us against them"" movie. Try it for yourself!"
3,Not the best but certainly not the worst either.,"Freedomland starring Samuel L. Jackson and Juilanne Moore is a messy and complicated film but it does have some high points as well. Moore's performance is challenging and different. The camera trickey is a bit annoying at times especially the scene when Jackson's character is hounding Moore in the investigation room. The ending is unsatisfying but the middle kept my attention even though the film and outcome is predictable. Middle of the road film, decide for yourself."
1,Don't waste time or money,"This movie has more plot lines than an elm tree has branches. Movie goers are left wondering if the movie was suppose to be about race-relations, racial profiling, missing children, good cop/bad cop, or a mystery about an abandon orphanage. Samual L Jackson and Julianna Moore are great actors but are unable to pull it off in this picture that can only be labelled ""a mess."" It was long, drawn out and confusing. Go see ANYTHING else instead. I wouldn't even rent it when it come out on DVD, which as bad as this movie was, should be next week."
5,Freedomland,"This movie hits the ground running and never stops. The blu-ray edition is stunning! For my thoughts, Julianne Moore has never been so heart breaking as she has been in this one. The story is right out of the news. I love this movie!"
2,Stinkeroo,"""Freedomland"" is a mess. The basic premise: a woman, Brenda (a glammed down, scenery chewing{think about that horrifying and effective scene of Moore in ""Magnolia"" in which she goes off on the pharmacist...now times it times 50} from the usually effective Julianne Moore) has her car snatched, walks to the hospital with her hands bloodied and after about 15 minutes declares to a ""counselor-defender,"" Lorenzo Council (an intense Samuel L. Jackson who tries his level headed best to make sense of his part and this movie) that her son was in the back seat. This sets off a change of events that strains credulity at best and at worst has you scratching your head and wondering why you've spent your hard earned money on this crock.Nothing much works here and all the disparate elements: police brutality, racial profiling, child and spousal abuse instead of adding up to something important add up instead to an overheated hodge podge of a well made but silly melodrama."
1,What in the world???????,"This was an awful waste of my time movie. I actually didn't enjoy the acting or the story line in this movie. I only regret that I purchase this movie instead of renting it. If only I had read the reviews first, instead of just watching a preview on another video. That preview was very misleading. The story line is all over the place and very hard to understand. Some of the acting is just unbelieveable, and weak."
2,A Waste of Talent,"Julianne Moore and Samuel L. Jackson deserve to be in a much better movie than Freedomland, a ridiculous film about what happens when Brenda, a poor white woman, says her car has been hijacked. After giving testimony to several cops, she adds that, oh, by the way, her four-year-old son is in the car. Even though it's obvious to the detective, the viewer, and anybody with an IQ higher than George W. Bush that Brenda is lying, the cops decide to completely shut down the black project where they think the child, and his kidnapper, are. Accusations of racism and riots ensue, not a moment of which is believable. Edie Falco gives a very moving performance as a mother who's lost a child herself, despite the fact that most of the lines she has to deliver are absurd. Why all these talented people decided to make this ridiculous movie is a mystery to me."
1,Hilarious Joke in 3..... 2...... 1........,"......More like FreeDUMBland! WOOOOO! Take that movie!! Aw ye-ahhh! What's more, lotsa the ads made it look like there was gonna be ghosts or something, but this isn't true. How weak is that? Very, that's how."
2,DISAPPOINTING CRASH COPY,"FREEDOMLAND seems to want to be like the Oscar winning CRASH but it's not. Despite some stellar performances, the movie is one-sided, manipulative and sloppily directed. Samuel L. Jackson gives a fine performance as Lorenzo Counsel, a veteran cop investigating the alleged carjacking of a terrified woman, Brenda Martin. Martin is played by Julianne Moore and she acts like she wanted another Oscar nomination as she goes from frightened mother to neurotic mother. She's quite good in several scenes. William Forsythe and Ron Eldard are very good in supporting roles as Jackson's partner and Moore's brother, but the performances don't salvage the movie from being another ethnic mess."
2,Freedomland gets the Boot.,"This movie wasn't as grand or as groundbreaking as I thought it would be or supposedly heard. Yes, the characters are believable and all of that, but Juliane's character has a flaw. Yes, we are interested to know what happened when she had gotten carjacked but her performance pretty much takes a downward spiral from there, making us wonder why we're even watching at that point. There are topics of social tension of predjudice and racism, and it just makes the movie that much more uncomfortable. Not to mention the fact that the movie drags, drags, drags it's point's across that aren't even that shocking to begin with.I think that this movie was a lot of hype and just too long. Plus, the ending killed the entire movie. Once we realize the truth, we don't even want to acknowledge it by then.Plus, it's still a question as to whether this is a drama, thriller, or suspense movie.Pass this movie up."
2,Wasted two hours of my life.,"Yeah this is one if I had seen it in the movies I would have been very upset. But thank god for the free weekly rental coupons from my blockbuster online account. Man this movie was slow, it had a very poor plot, and it had sub par acting performances. Did I forget to say it was also predictable? Well it is. Before you are a fourth of the way through the movie you pretty much know what is going to happen. Don't waste your time with this one like I did."
5,Arabic,This is my third language from Instant Immersion. The Arabic is easy to follow and understand. I have surprised myself by using a few words and the receiver smiles pleasingly when I pronounce the words dead on. Great learning language.
5,Come and Sign with Alex and Leah!,"These anticipated products lived up to their expectations! My 4 year old and 20 month old love to sing, dance and sign with Alex, Leah, Rachel and their friends. We can, and often do, watch Signing Time all day. They have given us a means of communication that has helped with the ""terrible twos"" and word recognition. My husband and I find ourselves signing with friends and family and love it."
4,Dinasaur BBQ,Haven't tried any recipes yet but I will surely put it to use this spring. Looks like some good recipes in there. I would say well worth the money.
3,shipping problem,"I ordered this great cookbook as a Christmas gift. The book is wonderful, the order, however, was lost and did not get here in the time frame quoted. When I went to check on the order they did not seem to be able to find it."
5,Recipes true to the menu,"This is by the far the best bbq cookbook ever! John's recipes are the only ones I follow to the ""T"". If you have followed the recipe, the food will taste identical to what you get served at the Dinosaur. One of the only things I miss about living in Upstate NY is the Dinosaur and Crunch Hockey. John is a great cook, I remember when he used to bring the truck to catering events and dish up plates."
5,A remarkable utility cookbook with humor...for all kitchens..indoors and out,"As a BBQ nut and someone who just enjoys cooking, I have used this cookbook for nearly ten years and continue to return to it for recipes both basic and complex. The book is comprehensive in that it provides not only wonderful recipes for entres, but complements as well, such as sauces, rubs, seasoning and brining techniques that when combined, yield exceptional results. Recipes included go beyond those limited to smoking or grilling methods. It contains some wonderful twists for soups, salads, and desserts as well. This book is written with humorous antecdotes throughout and virtually all recipes can be prepared with readily accessible ingredients. It is my ""go to"" book whenever I'm interested in preparing food that makes the soul feel good and it's the only cookbook that I have purchased over and over again as a gift for nearly any occasion. I can't overstate the benifits of having this one in your kitchen."
5,Great Cookbook,I love this cookbook and all the recipes! I have had some recipes from a friend and they are amazing. I can't wait to cook for my family with these recipes.
3,Good but not great,You'll find a handful of fun stuff to do in this one but only about half the book will even get you wanting to fire up the grill.
5,"Not only the best book, but a real deal top notch BBQ joint!","I got this cookbook shortly after going to the BBQ. It was just by accident we found the restaurant while up in Syracuse. I managed to ""accidentally"" find my way back several times that weekend..until I was nearly too sick from stuffing my face with meat to finish my nursing clinicals. Whoops!This book is the mecca of BBQ cookbooks. Try it, you will love it! I also just noticed that Wallyworld box mart has started stocking their sauces and I snatched up the last 2 bottles to mop my chops with out of laziness.Nothing is a substitute for actually visiting this awesome joint so start saving up those frequent flyer miles so you too can enjoy the source of inspiration for this cookbook! :) Stepping in there is like stepping into a movie of sorts. Lots of pizzaz and attitude - much like this book. I've had lots of BBQ in my life - been to Tennessee and Texas to name a few places - and Dino is right up there with the best ever."
5,A REAL WINNER,"I have never enjoyed a cookbook more than this one. I had a Bar-B-Que last weekend and made only Dinosaur Bar-B-Que recipes. Every dish was divine. The cajun corn, barbecue beans, cornbread, black beans and rice and everything else I made was amazing. The ""Red Rub"" is the best rub I have ever used. We finished with the peanut butter pie. WOW!!!!!"
5,Awesome!,"Drunkin Shameless Shrimp, Sausage Bread, Mac N Cheese Sheperds pie....Our dear friends cook from this book all the time. Book is user friendly and creative. Found the above mentioned are just a few that are now, staples in our lives....Yum! Thanks L & L!"
5,It just doesn't get any better....,"On the one hand we are very lucky that the Rochester Dinosaur is only an hour away---but on the other hand it is an hour away and some days that is not feasible. I have tried for years to make their incredible ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" with spicy buttermilk dressing but haven't really hit the mark. It is wonderful to have the recipes--that make this restaurant worth a drive in a snow storm--right at my fingertips. My family has two favorite BBQ places--the Dinosaur in Rochester and Southern Soul in St. Simon Island GA...truly food fit for the Gods. We thank the Dinosaur for being so generous with their secrets. Even though it's great to be able to make things at home, the atmosphere makes it still worth the drive. This is a very easy to follow, fun cookbook. I'd give this 10 stars if I could."
5,Astronomy book for people without computers,"This book has a number of tables and methods for people who do not have a computer (since few people back in 1961 had one). It also has the most extensive information on manual conversion between Gregorian and Julian calendar I've seen, as well as a very thorough list of when the Gregorian calendar was adopted in various countries (or states, provinces, etc.)."
3,Not really 101 projects,"I just received this book and was really looking forward to a lot of different projects. I was disappointed that some of the projects in this book were slight variations of each other, and in fact there was one project for HO and larger scale immediately followed by the exact same project in N scale.Overall there is a lot of good information - but I wouldn't total them to be 101"
5,Wow,"I love the marine animals, the water tanks, the shows, the filters. The expansion certainly has ""expanded"" the FUN"
2,disappointed,"We have a Windows Vista 2007 program, when my daughter downloaded and started playing the screen ""vibrated"" and she said it wasn't like the game she played at her friends house. We bought Zoo Tycoon just for the Marine expansion pack-now she just plays with Zoo Tycoon only."
5,Wonderful Addition to Zoo Tycoon 2,"This addition only enhances Zoo Tycoon 2. You can create marine biomes using walls, or just a natural water feature. You can create shows with the dolphins and orcas, and some of the animals you can interact by riding them!. It is a little difficult to set up the shows, because they won't perform unless they are perfectly happy in their environment, but it is worth the purchase."
5,Only for zoo tycoon collectors,Note: This game Requires Zoo Tycoon 2 or Zoo Tycoon 2 Zookeeper CollectionThis expansion gives a new challenge for players with the need to keep tanks clean and the option of traing animals to perform tricks the pricecurrently the price around $20 is a little too much for its contents unless you are a big fan of the series.
4,Can train animals for shows,"With this expansion pack, you can now train marine animals to do shows. Through series of tracing with the mouse, clicking the mouse, and pressing the arrow keys, you train each animal on their different tricks. Then you can choose the order of the tricks to customize your shows. You can also choose to purchase a trainer and have him/her do the training for you. My 6-year-old son loves Zoo Tycoon 2 and enjoys it even more since we've purchased the Marine Mania and Extinct Animals expansion packs."
5,"Tons of fun, very cute",This game is fun for more than one person to sit down a create together. A great family time game. Teaches kids to be responsible for the lives of animals.
3,A Good rental.... not worth purchase for 8 hours of gameplay,"This game is good, but over very quickly. It took me roughly 6-8 hours to finish it. Yes the graphics are good, the environment is amazing, but this game has no replay value so why buy it? Nothing special happens after you beat it (ie. no alternate ending, new characters, erc.). You can complete it in the span of a 5-night rental at Blockbuster."
3,not all that fun,"alright get ready for a big action packed thriller game!!,heh not really. its quite boring. yet complicated. its boring because theres lots of very long staircases and you have to keep going up and down all of them,also you run across a pitaful disoriented princess that you have to hall aruond all the time.athorwise i would give it a five star rating cause the fights are really fun graphics are really good but its constantly having to look after the princess!"
2,ICO...,This game was wonderful to play all the way through. The puzzles keep you thinking yet they don't get in your way. The game play seems fluid and none of the puzzles seem contrived or forced. The fighting is fun. The landscape is stunning. I am glad to own this game even thogh I don't think I will probably play it again this year.
4,good but short,"After playing the Final Fantasy series, I bought this game expecting to play it for a week or two. Within 8 hours the game was over and I don't see myself playing it a second time. The graphics are impressive and the flow of the game is good, but there just isn't enough of this game to justify buying it. Rent it for a weekend."
4,Art or Game?,"Ico, a work of art with little parallel. It is a prequel/sequel to Shadow of the COlossus (Shadow coming out later but it could have happened centuries before this game... maybe?). The game is just beautiful. It is early PS2, but it does not stop the asthetic of the game. The graphics are sharp, clean, and pretty. The puzzles are smart, challenging, and remarkable. The levels can be frustrating, but you can figure them out. There is only one boss and she is sort of difficult if you don't know how to do it.Get this game if you have a PS2. I know the PS3 version with SHadow is coming out soon, but if you don't have a PS3 then get this version. It is cool, clean, beautiful, and has an ending so tender and soft that you might just cry."
5,Simply Amazing...,"i just solved ico. it is the most amazing game i have ever seen. i can't even explain it, but it was such a moving experience. it really was. the story is beautiful... it was like i was watching a movie but i was in control of the lead character's destiny. if you don't already own this one, you are missing out."
5,Awesome,"This game is very cool, when you zoom into the character, the game plays like a cg animation. This is one of the most atmospheric games I've played, second only to the final fantasy series. Dark Cloud (...), but Sony has reedeemed themselves with this release. Highly Reccomended!"
4,Good game...but hard.,"""Ico"" is good and all,but I find it to be rather difficult.Solving the puzzles is easy for me.It's just I find it tough,to try and battle the spirits,while trying to save the girl at the same time.The spirits always end up grabbing her and flying away with her before I have time to get back to her and pull her up out of the ground.Plus,when you get knocked down,it takes forever to get back up.Overall though,this is still a very good game.The story is fantastic.The graphics are pretty outdated,but for their time,they are very good.I've heard many people before comparing this to ""Shadow Of The Colossus"".I think ""Ico"" is alot better though.""Shadow Of The Colossus"" was very boring to me,but I highly recommend you check this game out.I hope you have an easier time battling and defeating those dark spirits,then I did."
5,a must have kind of game,"It's one of those games that once you own it it becomes one of your favorite ones,it keeps you interested to know what's next,I definately recommend it."
5,ICO IS A MUST,This game has wonderful graphics and a really cool distance focus system(steady your thumbs and it'll focus keep moving and the distance gets blured... much like real life... try it you'll see) on top of the graphics the story line is drawing.. as you start you have no idea but are drawn into the game much like a waking dream. This game is a non violent thought proviking game that is a much needed breath of fresh air in the gaming world. This game is not geared twards the blood and guts driven industry but more of a quality game than you'd be likely to find in a more popular or publisized title. if you have a few days to sit and enjoy a great game try ICO it's relaxing and leaves you feeling good... and after all isn't that the point of gaming?
5,It is awesome,"The game itself is awesome; however, the game lasted way more to reach my house than the estimeted time. I don't regret buying it, it was totaly worth it !"
3,Renter,As far as 1 player adventure goes ... this game is not too shabby. I would never reccomend buying it because you can rent it and finish it in a couple days. The graphics are amazing! The characters are pretty good though the evil shadow guys get a little on the repetitive and uncreative side after a few hours. The puzzels were not too difficult and the ending was a grain of salt in the already underenthused wound. Bottom line: If you want to waste a couple days with nice graphics go rent it.
4,Great Game But,"Man is it ever short. I rented it one day and had it beat the next. I'm glad I didn't buy it because of it's short play and lack of any real replay value. I went with Silent Hill 2 which has 5 endings and different difficulty settings. ICO is a beautiful game and much much fun to play. The puzzles are very simple though, but this game is really just about a quick thrill and great graphics which is achieves greatly. The shortness and easy puzzles keep me from giving it 5 stars. Definately a weekend rental."
2,"It's not that good, trust me.","I bought this game, thinking it would be as good as the many reviews claim. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. This is just my opinion, but, this game is boring as hell. You just wander around a drab-looking castle looking for a way out. Maybe it's because I'm 16, but I need something more exciting. You pretty much just run back and forth opening doors, dragging boxes and fighting evil spirits occasionally. Even when you do that, it's just plain annoying. Trust me, it's not all as impressive as they say."
2,Ico; How did this thing get good reviews?,"Captivating, epic, amazing...All of these words do NOT apply to the highly hyped, and highly over rated game, Ico. How this game recieved such high marks is a mystery to me, yet I feel it is my duty to warn others about it. Ico brings new definition to the word pointless, since through most of the game you are left wondering why the heck you want to go on, playing a game with a hollow plot, poor character development, and an annoying kid that makes you want to run him off a cliff, just to see him die! The only ray of light that shines through this dull title is the amazing visual effects brought out by the programmers... Unfortunately, graphics do not make the game, and Ico proves this. So be warned, you would be better off investing in airline stock than you would buying this game."
3,It's not THAT great...,"I'm surprised at all of the 5 star ratings for this game. I do agree that the environment of the game is impressive, but, the games stumbles in its gameplay, as I found it rather repetitive and boring. The puzzles are not that hard to figure out and, as mentioned in other reviews, the game is short. Recommended only if you can find it cheap."
2,Technically competent...,"...but extremely boring. Figuring out how to drop things on the companion of the main character is by far the most interesting aspect of this game.Fantastic artwork, and relatively bugfree. Wait for it to go on sale or buy one used."
2,Slow as molasses on a cold winter day,"I wanted to like this game,really I did. I love fantasy,books,games,movies etc. And the concept for ICO is a good one. But man, this game is painfully boring,and slow. Its one of the most boring games I have ever played. For hardcore puzzle lovers only."
5,Great Game,Played Shadow of the Colossus and decided that I needed to play this game. I heard it was one of the most beloved game and gave it a try. It did not disappoint. If you don't like puzzle games or if you like a lot of dialog then this is not the game for you. People who have played Shadow of the Colossus should know how this game would be like. It could get repetitive if you're not into the story but overall I really enjoyed this game.
2,Didn't work,"I've had 2 PS2's so far and none of the blue discs seem to play in them. The first PS2 I had I tried to play tribes that didn't work. Then my second PS2 I tried to play ICO. The graphics were good i'll give you that, but my PS2 has a hard time loading everything up. I'll give this game 2 stars overall because of the graphis in the cutscenes that I did see. As far as gameplay goes couldn't tell you the thing wouldn't work. I recommend renting this game first to make sure your PS2 is capable of reading the blue discs."
1,A letdown. Maybe i'm not a puzzle fan.,"I don't really consider this a game. Yes, it is very different. But, what is good in diffrence is bad in gameplay. The princess cannot climb chains at all. Can't she feel a chain? COME ON! The combat is stupid. Look at me! I'm hitting black shadows with a stick! WOW! The puzzles are interesting, but i hate that call that Ico has when calling for Yorda. SQUAWK! Also, PLEASE TRANSLATE YORDA! Maybe i'm not a fan of puzzle games. Oh well."
1,this game stinks,i think that it takes way to long to get into the game and it seems that every 10 minutes is a cut seen
1,WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED,"This game sucked so bad. It was such a waste of my money. The story was stupid. The commands didn't even work. None of it even made sense. I couldn't even get it to do easy normal commands in the first level, so I took it back. Summary: DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!"
4,a good game that could have been great!,"Visually, it was amazing, the areas where rather expansive, although, some people complain about ""fog"" there is hardly any until the end, just to make things a bit of a challenge, I personally beat it in around 5 hours, although i can see how it might take longer, It would be a greater challenge for someone younger. The controls are very good. Unfortunatly, it was a bit buggy, where the pause menu would pop up and not go away. The battles could have been more challenging, as well as some puzzles. Other than the bug, i think the ending was a slight disappointment, but hopefully it will lead way to a sequel.. otherwise.. ew... and also the fact that replay value is none...Sony, if you're reading this... a sequel that is equally lush, longer, and even more challenging! I love a challenge... def, a good game to rent..."
4,AWESOME ...... BUT ........,"Really awesome inded ..... but the game is VERY short ..... I am no game expert and I beat it in 5 hours my first time and defenetly my last , since adventure games , in my opinion , got no replay value .Anyway , the graphics are really good , the levels are sooo big that some times you just can't see the entire stage , and that is saying a lot , because ICO has barely any fog .The enemies are a little anoyining , they keep taking Jorda ( the girl you meet and have to save ) the whole time and trying to push her into this really weird black hole .... and if she completely falls down in it , it's game over .Of course ICO is a really good rental , but lacks gameplay hours .... it's not that the game is short , NOOO , it's actually realllyyyy big , but the puzzles are a bit easy ... maybe one or two will make you think a bit more .Enough said , good game that lasts for only a while ."
3,Entertaining game for 4 - 6 people,I bought this after playing the larger version with friends of mine. Thought that friend could use a travel size version to enjoy with her family on long drives. Also bought one for myself.
5,Landmark 1955 recording,"Excellent music by Khanji. You have the great 1955 live recording from his youth, and the mellow music of his older years, when he was still playing well and accompanied by none other than Zakir Hussein the greatest tabla player."
5,Necessary anthology,"Crazy as it may sound I have been a Laurie Anderson fan since I was eight years old. I heard Mr. Sharkey and Gravity's Rainbow and it was all over from there. I always wanted to own this book but it has been out of print for decades. She covers much of the info that appears in this book in her 'United States Live' CD set, and 'The Ugly one with the jewels,' and yet seeing it in print as a sort of portfolio of her work is a great compendium to what I already have. If you are a real fan, this is a must have."
4,Groovey,"I found the book to be great. It was funny, catchy, and there was a good story. Sort of reminded me of Forest Gump. The story was easy to understand, because Chance accidently simplified everything with his analogy. Watch the movie too. I give it an A."
3,Good,"Fable. Satire. Gimmick. Twisted. Believable, but not quite plausible. Pure Kosinski. As always, a rush."
3,Was the movie better?,"I bought this book expecting some answers to questions the movie posed. Nothing doing. Don't get me wrong, this is a great book and it literally zips right by. But I couldn't help but think that Mr. Kosinski wrote the book and when Peter Sellers finally got someone to make the movie (Sellers tried selling the idea of an adaptation of this book to the studios for years) that he took the opportunity to change, and improve things, in his story. I read it in about four hours and it's an inexpensive book so go ahead and buy it. I'm sure you'll enjoy it for the price."
4,Not his best,"It seems to me that the works of Kosinski set in Eastern Europe have far greater strength and authenticity than the work set in America. This particular little piece of ' Look at the anarchic dismal impersonal civilization we live in' school has a touch of the randonmness and violence which Kosinki's world is pervaded by.The story of the gardener whose guardian dies and who has to encounter the ' real world' for the first time gives no sense of any redeeming moment or beauty in life. One might say that Becket doesn't either and that is his genius. But I have the sense that the emptiness which Kosinki finds at the heart of 'Television Civilization's is an emptiness in the heart of Kosinski himself.Unfairly perhaps I think of Tolstoy and that kind of fiction which makes the person love life more, not wonder why one is reading something which makes one wonder if life really is so worthless and so small."
5,"Chance, What a guy!!!!!!1","The story of Chance Gardiner. Is a great story. In the book Being There, he plays a character that doesn't know a lot. But when he is put into a situation that he needs to try and figure what is happening. He Doesn't ever really figure out what is going on he just kind of goes with the flow. The book is about how he does this and it is great ll teh expreinces that he has makes the book great."
2,Not that funny,"I was expecting a laugh-out-loud book, but this book is not that funny or witty. The plot is obviously far-fetched -- a garderner becomes a media hero -- but it doesn't matter because implausibility can be great tool for humor. However I thought the author Kosinski didn't really go after this plot, the possibilities were great but there's not enough biting sarcasm . I think the problem is this book was written in the 70's, long before the current Ironic Age, so the whole thing comes off as pretty tame now."
3,quick short read,"Our book discussion group read this book and we all felt that it a pretty good story. The ending was disappointing but after discussing further, was appropriate. This is a quick read book and can be read in about 4-5 hours."
3,OK Book,"I am not the type of person who reads books on a daily basis. For me to even finish reading a book I have to like it enough to get through the first few chapters. This is not one of those book. At the end of every chapter I found myself wanting to just jump to the final chapter and read the conclusion. Though this is not a great book, I do recommend it."
2,Chance is a videot,"I think you could compare the plot in Being there with the good old bible ""..God made the world in seven days and the last day he rested."" Just like chance/chauncey does in the end. I think the book is difficult to understand completely."
2,stupid honesty,"Being There is a book about a man, but only physically. Chance or chauncy as everyone would call his has the mind of a child. But his blunt honesty is refreshing in a way. I was pleased how the author wrote a charater that we should all try to assimilate some of his views. For example his honesty he doesent feel he needs to candy coat anything for anyone because he doesent see the point but on the flip side he doesent see much in anything. The book in my opinion was a refection of our society to a degree...but thats it, most of the charaters I thought were dull and almost like a bunch of zombies trying to find meaning in nothing, but over analyzing everything and sady enough making themselfs sound dumber and dumber with every sentece they speak. I reall like the way chance was honest a quality that is not found much now a days but i think that chance would have been a better charater if he had a stonger mind and not one of a child."
2,surprisingly dull,"This is another of those novels that is less good than the film that was made from it. After I saw the film, I read the book and it utterly lacked the wit and irony of the performance by Sellers in the film. The novel moves slowly, is not very funny, and the writing style utterly lacks flavor. In contrast, the film was the perfect parody of the beginning of the Reagan era, in which appearences and the assumptions of the observers mix in the most surprising ways. Oh well. It appears to me that Kosinsky did his thing and had nothing much to say after The Painted Bird.Not recommended."
4,Being There and boring?,"Jerzy Kosinski's Being There is an entertaining and funny novel which was immortalised by Peter Sellers in the film of the same name.Reading it at first it seems to be uninteresting but as continuing it gets more and more exciting when the lonely gardener Chance has to move out of the large mansion ,he has been living since his childhood .Chance is led by various misun- derstandings which reach their top when he is ellected for a president candidate."
4,A great story!,"The protagonist of this amazing novel is called Chance. This spelling name ""Chance"" symbolises the development of the satire 'Being There'.The whole story consists of a number of misunderstandings, which underline the criticism on American political system. The whole novel is well written and easy to read even for students who do not have a lot of previous knowledge in the english language. Also the plot may be interesting for pupils in upper grades."
3,Idiotic!,"Perhaps I'm missing something here......this tale lacks substance and is too fantastical is hold my attention. Maybe the author wants us to consider the vagaries of politics, the stupidity of people, and our desire to rub shoulders with a ""star"". In my view, a waste of time!"
5,About time,"A friend of mine who is also a Beats scholar suggested Being There for one of my classes. It turns out I can't use it for the class, but I loved the book and took it down in one sitting. I should have read it years ago."
5,"Wonderful, light read","Simply a wonderful book b/c it brings you into the mind of a simple, friendly person who brings happiness to all around him. Don't watch the movie."
3,"It was an okay, book, it wasn't that intresting to me.",This book I thought was a little out my league. It seemed to go very slow. The book just wasn't that intresting to me because of what the books events were. I just didn't like it very much.
5,It's the greatest book in all world,"The book it's Awesome, Chance is the Forrest Gump of the 70', he is a hero but he doesnt know That."
1,Bad choice,"The Ironing board was very difficult to install. When mounted, it was not flush to the wall. The board did not open flat and if I tried to push it down, the wall mounting moved. I disliked it and sent it back."
5,Happy In TEXAS,"This is a great product, easy to mount works like a charm and looks very neat when folded up with cover in place. Tried all the usual places, Home Depot, Lowes, Sears,.... and found only the ones that mount in the wall. I put this item up in less than 30 minutes without destroying the wall, and my wife LOVES it. I ordered it from Amazon without expedited shipping, I had the product in about a week. Very Happy Buyer"
1,Ironing board nightmare,I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It's tippy and too wide and the cover ripped after using it for a minimal period of time.
2,Very expensive and seems to be very weak after 2 weeks.,"I was expecting a very solid product and once mounted it has a lot of give and it feels like the hinge it is mounted on is too loose. I may have a mismanufactured one, it doesn't seem right to me, I will keep an eye on this to see how it goes, but for the price I am letdown so far."
4,A COMPAGNION PIECE,"It is estimed that PIERRE MacORLAN wrote 60 songs;he started writing them at age 67 which is rather unusual.He had of course an interesting past as a writer of fiction before he turned to songs.When he was asked about the inspiration for his songs he said that they were mainly about his turbulent and adventurous younger days spend in cabarets of MONTMARTRE like LE LAPIN A GILL.This cd if it wasn't for the first five numbers(mainly leftovers recorded in 1989)would have been almost as priceless as CHANSONS DU QUAI DES BRUMES.As it is, it is still worth buying because of the set recorded in the sixties 8 to 17.FANNY is often considered to be his best number and LE PROGRES D'UNE GARCE is quite funny.Those who like MacORLAN must also check out the 1964 JULIETTE GRECO chante MacORLAN,only 32 minutes but very good."
5,Excellent book in a terrific series!,"This book, along with the rest in the Switched at Birth series, was so good I couldn't put it down. Just when you think you have figured out the ""mystery"" surrounding the sets of twins in these books, some new twist pops up. Warning, though. Don't try to read them out of order, or you will probably miss a lot of important details (however, the authors do a good job of summarizing the past stories in each book). I usually have found in a series written by more than one author that there is a lot of discrepancy in the story line--not the case here. The author's did a wonderful job sticking together on their stories. Simply put, this was a WONDERFUL book!"
5,Really funny!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the best books I have ever read! It is a great story of a teacher's journey of trying to reach not only his students, but the comunity itself. There can be some dull moments, but that is only because you are comparing it to the rest of this highly eventful story."
4,Interesting read,"This book was recommended by a neighbor as new residents to Coastal Georgia. As a former teacher, I was amazed at the tale told in this story. It is heart wrenching with details of the life that was during this time. Mr. Conroy's writing style, humor, and perspective makes for a book that is hard to put down. It is a story of following what you know is the right thing to do no matter the adversity you are up against."
2,Not my favorite,I was disappointed in this book. Pat Conroy is usually one of my favorites but even though the writing was good the story left something to be desired.
5,All around a great book!,"In The Water is Wide, by Pat Conroy, he does a great job of writing about his experiences on an island called Yamacraw where he is faced with difficult challenges. He shows us how he developed a bond with these childreb abd taught them things they may have never known before. I thoroughly enjoyed this book because he made you feel as if you were him and that you were one of the students watching from afar. This book also made me laugh right out loud sometimes, like when the kids would tell him he was crazy or he would try and trick them when he was teaching them something. This book also made me know why I wanted to be a teacher so badly, so I could make a diffrence in kids'lives just like he did."
3,Interesting,"This is an example of a developing writer. If you've read some of his latter works, you can see how he has perfected his craft. Its a good resd, but not up to the level of his later works."
2,"Love the writing but not the ""hardcover""","Love the writing but I thought I was getting a 1st edition rather than a paperback inserted into a hardcover. I feel I got cheated and if I knew the facts, I would have just purchased the Kindle version."
4,Gullah Opinion,"After having read the book, we had an opportunity to tour Daufuskie Island (Yamacraw Island in the book). After the tour we stopped at the General Store and noticed that The Water Is Wide was not offered for sale. We asked about this. We were told the Gullahs thought the book put them down and they did not want the book available on the island. ..... Interesting."
1,Bad,"This book read like it was written by a fifteen year old who, with a lot of work, could develop into a decent writer. But is anything but, yet. I have visited Defuski Island where this book was based, and so was interested to get the book because of having seen its setting. But I still didn't like the book."
1,Lost in the mail,I did not receive the book I ordered. The tracking process indicated that it had been sent to Atlanta to the Lost package dept. There was no name to deliver to and no place to return. I was disappointed not to receive a book I paid for.
4,Teachers will love this book,"Pat Conroy's ""The Water is Wide"" is an early work of his that talks about his teaching career on a Carolina sea island with gullah children of very little education. Teachers will find this inspiring. I loved how he told the status-quo maintaining administration to go to hell! As always, Conroy's prose and understatement is terrific."
5,Conroy is a great storyteller!,"I have never read a book by Pat Conroy that I didn't love, and The Water is Wide is no exception. Conroy is one of the best writers of our time. I didn't just read this book; I became involved in it. I wanted to help the students myself. As with all of his books, I was sorry when I came to the end."
4,A worthwhile read,"Captivating,sad, uplifting, discouraging and delightful all in one. The pages fly by. Shared it with my girlfriends and we had a great discussion regarding education in in the US. A worthwhile read!"
4,A memoir from a younger Pat Conroy.,"Set on a small island off the Carolina shores, where Conroy spent a year teaching a small group of black children, who were so lost in time that the name of the ocean that surrounds their island was unknown to them. This colorful and delightful memoir will warm your heart and open your eyes to a system that has not delivered on its promises. Those promises being, the right to an education funded by taxes and delivered in the appropriate manner by someone who can get the job done.Ever upbeat we find the protagonist working his way into the lives of the children on this all but forgotten island. We watch them attempt to bloom like so many different flowers, and enjoy their trials and tribulations as well as their ability to conquer their ignorance when given half a chance. Different than his novels, PRINCE OF TIDES and BEACH MUSIC, but none the less just as good, this is an endearing and sweet taste of a champion among the children. Kelsana 7/24/01"
4,The Water is Wide,"This is a true account of Pat Conroy's year of teaching on an island he calls Yamacraw which actually is the island of Daufuskie, one of the coastal islands of South Carolina. Daufuskie is close to Hilton Head, but the difference between them is night and day. While Hilton Head is completely modern and developed, Daufuskie is still natural, beautiful, serene, quiet and tranquil. Because the 20th century basically ignored this small island, time seems to have stood still. The students he taught, cut off from modern society, knew almost nothing of events outside their narrow and impoverished life. Conroy attempted to expose the students to a world outside of the island. While the main theme is education, a secondary and strong theme is life on the island. This book is well written. It was read after my visit to Daufuskie where I saw the school he taught in, and experiencing that really brought the book to life."
4,The Water is Wide,The Water is Wide arrived on time and in decent condition for an old book. have a very Merry Christmas andHappy New Year.
3,Interesting story brought down by arrogant narrator,"This story is touching and especially relevant for anyone going into the teaching field. It relates a year the author spent teaching on an isolated island off South Carolina. The children are charming as are the residents of the island. The author, sadly, is way too impressed with himself. Even when he admits to faults, he does it in a way that ends up patting himself on the back which makes him annoying on a meta-level. The story--that should be about the children on the island--ends up being about the author himself and he's just not as interesting as they are. Still, it's worthwhile reading for anyone involved in education."
2,Substandard Kindle Edition!,"If I were only rating Pat Conroy's wonderful book, I'd be giving it five stars instead of two. However, the Kindle edition, which I purchased 26 December 2008, is riddled with ridiculous typographical errors which make reading a chore. You'll honestly do a double-take on every page, sometimes having to pull yourself out of the story to decide what word ought to be there instead of its mistaken substitute.""Off"" is very frequently rendered ""of."" ""Says"" is very often rendered ""sas."" In at least one place, ""the"" is rendered as ""die."" At locations 2884-98, we read, ""He is an American movie star in a America (sic) movie..."" These are just a few examples; I could go on all night.Please do yourself a favor and hold off buying the Kindle edition of ""The Water is Wide"" until these problems are corrected and you can savor every word of Pat Conroy's inspiring, infuriating, life-affirming story."
3,Interesting..,"This book had the most ups and downs in a book than i have ever read, but i thought it was pretty good.The Water is Wide was about the chronicles that Pat Conroy had teaching on an island off the coast of South Carolina. The island was totally exiled from the rest of the world. The special thing about the island is that its mostly comprised of blacks and the kids on the island have been neglected by the system.Overall i thought it was an ok book. If you like autobiographies (especially about teachers) you'd be interested."
3,English class Summer reading,"In my opinion the book was just O.K. It had a good story line, but it just didn't appeal to me."
2,Found missing book for collection,"Since Pat Conroy is my sister's favorite author and this was one hardback book of his she didn't have I came to Amazon.com to find one. It was there and I got it. Unfortunately, it was misrepresented in its advertising and was not in as good as condition as presented."
5,Water is Wide,Loved this book. Very well written. It gives an insight into the people whom Conday was teaching and their circumstances. The contrast of life on the island and life in town was interesting.
2,disappointing . . .,"I loved the look and the size of this watch, and the fact that it was water-resistant. However, within 3 weeks it stopped working. It may have needed a new battery, but I wasn't interested in having to get a replacement for a brand-new watch, particularly because there was a second problem: the color was starting to wear off the strap in spots. At least this happened within Amazon's 30-day return period. It's been returned.This does make me reluctant to try another Invicta watch, despite their overall good reviews. I'd definitely avoid anything with a similar type of strap."
2,dial style doesn't match watch,i love the invicta brand and style but this one looks too timex-y. the white dial/black number/markers just doesn't look good
5,Fresh perspective with new insights !,"Merlin's Harp is a great short read (one day ), that will transport the reader back to Arthurian times through the eyes of an important, but not much talked about player. The book reminds me of 'Forest House' by Marion Zimmer Bradley. It is light reading, yet keeps your interest. Merlin's Harp will give the reader new insight on Lancelot and Melwas, with a new revelation on Merlin and the Holy Grail"
4,Through the Looking Glass Edit of Arthurian Legends,"A refreshing new perspective for Arthurian legends we thought were thoroughly explored. I was not able to put it down. The characters and their relationships all had fresh twists. ""Lyrical"" is the most appropriate term used by other reviewers. Surprisingly well thought out were the interactions between the ""old"" religions and Christian beliefs during a time of transition."
3,The Fey,Original point of view on King Arthur from the Fey. Very well written. AEC is a good writer.But there is no point to this story. Nothing remarkable stood out after I finished the last page. I often reflect on and absorb a story after I finish and there was not much there. Loved the insight on the Fey but that wasn't enough.Free on kindle so no complaints. Maybe a generous three stars.
3,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I have to give this book a 3 simply since I didn't finish it and it was free on Kindle. Had I paid for it I would regret the purchase.The story is boring!! I reread sentences over and over before I finally said that book wasn't for me.It goes into so much wording that you lose interest before you are done reading a paragraph.I prefer the fast paced reading that keeps my interest from the get go.This book put me to sleep, hence the zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz's."
5,Exceptional,"This book is exceptional. I've worked on stage and on film. The first time I saw myself on film, I realize I was still trying to reach the back row of the theater. The trasition to film is described so effortlessly through out this book that It has helped me revisit my own experiences. The stories, the insights and experiences roll off the page. I keep it in my back pack to refer to. To keep it fresh."
3,Informative but Biased,"Mr. Barr's book is very informative and provides valuable information on the mechanics of acting in film or television. However, he has an obvious bias against theater. He consistently implies that theater actors are unable to create realistic performances. He refers to theater actors having to do without the ""glamour"" of theater when on a sound stage. Someone please tell me where this theater with all the glamour is..I've only been on the ones where there's hard work.He educates the poor shallow theater actors with such elementary concepts as that when one plays an evil character, one should not only play the character as ""evil."" I learned that in high school. He also devotes a whole chapter to the unrealistic notion that an untrained actor would be asked to do a stunt on film or television. Good technical information for those unfamiliar with the film process, but he has an axe to grind."
5,The best.,I have read a million acting books and this by far has been my favorite. So much that I am going to start their classes next month.
5,Excellent for live actors as well,I'm a community theatre director and recommend this book to my good actors who want to take their performance ability to the next level.
5,An awesome spiritual classic as timely today as in 1728.,"I read this book because Hannah Hurnard, author of Hind's Feet on High Places and other allegorical and devotional works, credits it with revolutionizing her spiritual life. Law exhorts Christians to offer all aspects of one's life and work as holy to God - work, finances, relationships, worship, prayer, etc. He reminds us of the Christian virtues of love, humility, peace, simplicity and conforming ourselves to God's will. This is a work which should not be forgotten or neglected by modern Christians."
5,This is not devotional candy,"With so many light weight devotional books flooding the market these days, it is good to sink one's teeth into a great spiritual classic. Law was an 18th century Anglican. As he grew, his theology also grew. Near the end of his life, his writings began to lean toward gnosticism. ""Serious Call"" was penned while Law was in his prime. It was on John Wesley's personal book shelf and greatly influenced the father of Methodism. This book will challenge the reader. It speaks as strongly to the 21st century reader as to the 18th century reader."
2,Print on Demand,"This book is assembled by a print-on-demand publisher, from a text that has been captured through OCR text recognition. As such, it has numerous typos and nonsense readings. It may be better to purchase a used version from an original printing."
3,"Great photos, but.....","While the photos are beautiful, the book was rather disapointing to me. First, as one other reviewer pointed out, it is not really a history or discussion. It is a list.... a lengthy list of names, with a paragraph or two for each designer, followed by another list of their films. This list is sometimes lengthy and sometimes only 1 or 2 films. Very British in the selections, too, since the editor was British. Second, it was published quite a while ago (Originally published in 1987, corrected and updated in 1991....though what motivated them to omit major designers like Motley at that point is very unclear.) and it does not even have an epilogue to bring us closer to the present. But I should have caught that it was a Dover publication. Otherwise I would have known that it was published 'as is' or more accurately 'as it was' at that time. Fine for some things, but a disappointment here. However, the phots are super, and for the most part extremely sharp, clear images."
2,Great method -ok dvd,"I am just starting 4otf with my corgi on the aframe. I think I will really like this method since it won't have the jarring effect on his corgi joints that a 2o2o will and is much easier to train then a pure running contact. However I was a bit diasappointed in the dvd. I had already read the article in Clean Run by Ann Croft but was hoping this dvd would provide some extra insights and more problem solving. I was bummed to find it had exactly the same info in the article I had already read. I guess if you are a very visual learner then this dvd will be helpful, but otherwise just read the article (very well written)."
2,a little light,"The author does not get into enough detail for me to be of very much help. If you know the concept of safety play, then you basically know what this book is all about.The author does discuss selecting high percentage shots and practice. Without practice, unforunately, there are times when neither a high percentage shot or high percentage ""dirty"" play are available execpt for all but the best players.It's not badly written, and it does have a few witty comments. If you read it you might pick up a few useful tips. I was disappointed with this book, but maybe I expected too much. If you like to keep things simple, you might like this book."
5,Dirty Pool: Playing to Win,"I just finished Duane's newest book, Dirty Pool. As usual for his books,it was well written, straight-forward, easy to read and understand. And, I actually learned something! Good job."
3,"Good product, not as good as I thought","I purchased this product per the advice of my acupuncturist. He said it provides long lasting moist heat to the affected area. Even with following the directions, I found that the heat does not last more than 10-15 minutes. It is also a chore to heat up as you need to heat it up in water in a pan on the stove each time you use it. I much prefer the rice packs that you can stick in the microwave. Will probably use it, but would not purchase again."
2,A lot smaller than I expected,"I thought I was buying the OVER SIZED moist heating pad, but it just resulted in being big enough for my hand......when I needed one that would be big enough for my entire back.....I guess the name OVER SIZED, made me think it was big enough. I think the description of the item is deceiving....I still want the one that is sized for the entire back, have not idea what size that would be...."
1,"Please, save your money!!","As a Physical Therapist with 40 years experience, I can assure you these are a far cry from the ""hot packs"" I used in the clinic back in the day. These are almost worthless; holds heat five minutes.... at best. Better off buying a good electric heating pad and wrapping a hot, moist towel around it. I wondered why they were so inexpensive; now I know why. I have no axe to grind against Chattanooga Group; this product simply should be taken off the market or be remanufactured to the quality hydrocollator hot pack of the past."
3,Adequate,No where near as substantial as the last one I had some years ago (lost is somehow). By substantial I mean the amount of material inside (sand?) that comprises the heat sink. Seems to be reasonably well made just less of it.
1,Looks can be very deceiving...,"From the photo, this looked exactly like a hydrocollator I purchased 20 years ago (yup lasted 20 years with moderate use). This one has hardly any heat sink material in it. The canvas covering looks decent...but the lack of heat sink material is like a car with no engine; looks good...but not very useful. Very disappointed :("
3,could be better,skimpy on filler does not hold heat longer than 15 mins.should add filler and charge more has potential to be great
1,Never buy this light!!!,"I originally installed a double circular flourescent unit and a single tube unit... I have now replaced both units at three times each... Unfortunately, I did not recognize the brand name when I ordered the last set ..Until I took the cover off... Previously, I had also replaced the circular tubes only to find that although the tubes were blackened and obviously burned out, that after replacement, the ballasts were also gone... In essence, In the last 3 years, I have replaced the units three times and also paid for a full set of replacement tubes ..... What a waste of money...."
5,A woman with a vision,"This book looks into the wonderful Tarot Garden which was made in 20 years by Niki de Saint Phalle. It has many pictures and opens the mind for great, colorful, living art."
5,An INVALUABLE guide to looking great and saving money.,"I just finished (and LOVED) Paula's other book, Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me, and this book is just as awesome. The Beauty Bible gives you all the basics that you need to know to take good care of your skin and create a natural look with your makeup. Some of her advice is just common sense but Paula's language is fun to read and easy to follow. She gives sensible, understandable answers to all kinds of skin care and makeup questions. I learned more from this book than any other beauty book I've ever purchased."
5,"Useful book on makeup everyone should read, especially teens","As owner and creator of the Beauty Chop, I read hundreds of books on makeup every year. This is a good one, particularly for young women and teens just beginning to experience the wonderful joy of using and experimenting with makeup.Paula's chapters on makeup application and making the right color choices are superb. Best part, she gives photos of herself actually applying the makeup step by step.Not only is Paula a beautiful woman in her own right, the steps and pointers she gives are useful and easy to follow."
2,Just like all her others,"While I learned a few things from Paula's other books, this one seems like a reorganization of her previous material into new chapters under new titles. For someone who is out to save us money, why is she selling yet another book with all the same information?"
4,"If you have Paula's other books, you probably don't need it","I have all of Paula's other books, and am very satisfied with them. However, this book contains much of the information in the previous books. And if you get her newsletter, like I do, then you already know pretty much everything in here. Feels like a rehash to me. I read it cover to cover and learned really nothing I didn't know already. Still, if you don't have her other books, and you don't need specific cosmetic reviews (i.e., how does the Lancome blush compare with MAC's) then definitely get this book."
2,"Technical, repetitive, lots of information","I have to agree with one of the other reviews--this is basically her other books but without as much editing--the book is VERY repetitive, to the point where it's hard to read more than a couple pages at a time. I do believe the book could be summed up in a few sentences and the remaining hundreds of pages are just reiterations and examples. I didn't find anything new (and therefore useful) in the book at all. It's rather boring."
4,Very good read for beginners.,"I have read it and I think it's good but not really worth 20 $ in my case because the level of my skin care knowledge is higher , there was nothing in this book that I did not know already. I wish I could have read it when I was 15 , in that case it would have saved me from making a lot of mistakes.So, I highly recommended for people that want to know more about skin care."
4,Awesome Headlamp,"I did not realize how much I would love the LED lights, but this dual mode headlamp is awesome for so many different applications. Only down side is to remember to double check that it is off or it will run batteries down quickly."
5,What a great series!!!,I first read the Sweet Medicines Prophecy books over 15 years ago. Loved each and every book in the series. If you are a fan of Native American historical fiction you will greatly enjoy these books. The setting and characters are so well developed that you will be transported to another time and place. Enjoy!!
5,Just found out there are more in the series can't wait,"Read this one first and was hooked from there. I just found out there are more but out of print. Going to go for it, can't wait to get started all over again."
5,Melodies From Heaven,"The All-American Rejects have outdone even the most experienced veterans in the music industry with their new self-titled CD, The All-American Rejects. This CD blends keyboards with guitar and drum loops, while Tyson Ritter, lead singer, sings about love gone wrong, and love that lasts. The first single, Swing Swing, starts out with an organ and proceeds into a raw guitar riff that will knock your socks off. If you don't have this album go out and buy it, I promise you won't be disappointed. These guys are going to make history, be there to see it happen."
5,Excellent!!!,"When I first heard this group I loved them. Got the CD and loved every song. ""i cant say that about many other artists"" When I listen to this group I hear influences of The Cure, Weezer, and many punky aspects.I recommend this album to anyone that wants some feel-good music!"
5,Best CD I've got,"Every track on this CD is great, you can tell Tyson and the band put tons of work into it. I caught their concert at Campbell and it was the greatest experience I've had out of all the concerts I've been to. (I didn't know that they weren't headlining the show until after)They are really nice guys, and their music is the bestI've heard. Great CD."
1,JUNK!,"The lead singer is one of the worst singers evar! He sounds good on the CD but if you've heard him live you'd know is voice is entirely digital and sounds nothing like it does on their LP. Stick with GOOD emo not this wannabe junk! I suggest you check out Early November, Further Seems Forever, Dashboard Confessional or the Postal Service for some REAL emo not this corporate processed MTV garbage! There's so much better emo out thar I don't know why anyone would listen to the All American Rejects!"
2,Good thing the price was so low.,"The All American Reject's debut album was a big disappointment. I had heard ""Swing Swing"" on the radio a couple of times, and it was catchy as hell. HMV was selling the CD for only $10, so I thought I'd give it a go. I found the entire album annoying and dull, except for ""Swing Swing"". I'm not one to need immediate gratification out of my music, but even after a third lesson I was bored out of my mind. The lyrics were the same old thing from almost all other emo bands, and the melodies just didn't work. It's albums like this that make an argument for downloading music. I should have spent the $10 toward a DSL subscription."
4,The All-American Rejects,"Hello, my name is Chelsea and I just want to say that, from what I've heard, I love and I'm planning on purchasing the CD. I'd also like to say that the lead singer has the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen. He's really hot, and I like the fact that the gutarist on his right side in the video is smiling like crazy, it's really cute. The All-American Rejects rock, but they could use a better name."
1,Typical band for 2003,"Great another pop/punk band that has a whiny singer terrible guitars an awful drummer & a bass that can not be heard. I find it funny how bands liek good charlotte,sum 41, all american rejects & simple plan get more attention then KoRn,marilyn manson,slayer,pantera, system of a down,mudvayne & slipknot amoungst other great rock bands it just show you how poorly the nu-metal/ heavy metal & goth rock is doing from teeny boppers buying crapp records by crappy bands like this."
5,Excellent,This is one of my favorite CDs. All of the songs are excellent. I think this CD will make anyone become a fan of AAR.
3,A decent album but nothing special!,This album was actually really decent as opposed to the follow up album move along. This album has some decent sounds on it. Overall an ok album for people looking for something these days that doesn't flat out suck!!
5,Great CD,I think this cd is awesome and the sound is different from all other artists. Their lyrics are what they feel and there is nothing wrong with that. Most people can relate to their songs and they sound great. You should purchase this cd for sure.
5,AAR IS SO RAD!,"The All-American Rejects debut cd is absolutely awesome. It captures the spirit and the soul; while still making you wanna rock out! It makes me feel serine but still not ashamed of my punk/alternative rock backround. This cds rocks, and every punk and altenative lover should buy it!"
5,The All American Rejects CD Review.,"This CD is great. It is one of the best CDs I've had. This band has a lot of talent. I think that a good band is made of an (odd) instrument. Example: Keyboard. That is a great plus. Go out and get this Cd, you'll love it if you like Punkish music."
5,a CD for all the rejects out there,"When I first heard Swing, Swing, I immediately liked it. When I heard it again, I was practically in love with this band. I spent the next two weeks looking in dozens of store until I gave up and ordered it online. I waited weeks in anticipation for it to come, and when it did, I opened it at once and listened to it. I was not disappointed. This self-titled CD was absolutely beautiful and near perfection. It starts off strong with ""Paper Heart,"" then slows down a little for ""Your Star."" It's combination of fast-paced and mellow songs make this an interesting CD. You might get tired of a song that last for over 5 minutes, but with the rejects, their songs are great 'til the last note. I've been listening to this CD at least once a day and I never get sick of it. I love the songs ""Don't Leave Me"" and ""Drive Away,"" but all of the songs are wonderful in their own way. I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to hear a completely original and creative artist."
3,Am I Missing Something...(2 1/2 Stars),"Everyone raves about this band like their something SOOOO great, but I just dont see it. There ain't no energy in ANYTHING on here, and lead singers voice is enough to make you want to tear your hair out. A couple tracks were OKAY, but the rest bored me to tears..."
3,It's Good,"I'm definitely NOT an EMO fan. My sis first introduced me to the music and I have to admit that I never liked any of it. But I encountered these guys and I can say with confidence that thay have talent. One of the best songs is ""Swing, swing."" It's worth a listen."
5,they rock my rejected world,"The All-American Rejects didn't get much notice at first,but all of their musical talent is finally paying off.Ever since Same Girl,New Songs,the have been rockin' it up.And Im sure they will keep it up.If there is one album you should buy this year,this is it."
5,5 stars,AAR's self-titled CD is definetly 5 stars! Its melodic pop mixed w/ rock and kind of an emo sound. The guitar riffs in this record are awesome! So are the lyrics and beats. Everyone can relate to this music...everyone should own this CD!
5,Not rejects anymore,"This cd is really good.Its got a punk sound,and im more of an emo person.But their slow songs are really good..Not sappy but truthful.I can connect to all thier songs on a personal level wich i feel is good.Buy this cd you wont be sorry"
5,great,"This is one of the few CDs that I own that I am able to listen to all of the way through without skipping any tracks. Every song brings a little something new to this album, and it never gets old."
5,great cd,this is an awesome cd. a mix of emo and punk. very lovey dovey and very up to beat. best cd ive heard in a long time. if your looking for something new get this cd.
4,Pretty good!,"The album was pretty good. The music was cute, and the lyrics were pretty good too, it just lacked the quality i thought it would have. It doesnt stink, but i wouldnt give it 5 stars. Some good songs (to me) are Swing, Swing, and The last song. I'd recommend it, but not highly."
2,Dont buy this!,"This was an awful CD. When i got this CD i really thought i was going to like it,but it was terrible. Pretty much every song except Swing,Swing was bad. Please dont waste your money on this. Buy a Good CD like Good Charlotte or Sugarcult."
5,Must Buy CD,"The music on this CD is so true about all relationships. Everyone has had their hearts broken and this CD is perfect for recovering. The All American Rejects music isn't pop but it isn't hard rock, you can actually understand what they are saying. Anyways, buy this cd it's awesome. Plus if your a girl, the guys are really hot. :)"
2,An All American Rejected CD,"I first heard these guys on T.V., playing ""Swing Swing"". I was in love. I was very disapointed when I finnaly got around to buying their CD.Swing Swing was the only blockbuster hit on the CD There were some okay songs in there, but nothing amazing.If you or a friend have a CD burner, burn yourself Swing Swing. A star and a half of this review were for Swing Swing, and a half star for those okay songs.If you like any part of this album, I reccamond litening to O.K. Go's ""Get Over It"".Shame how Swing Swing got stuck on such a bad album..."
4,Pop-Punk,"This is definetly a pop-punk album...It throws in a bit of emoish style, but still cannot lose that pop-pish sounding flavor. Although it is very poppy.... i still think it a good debut album with a lot of good songs. My favorite is My Paper Heart. They all have some good lyrics in them, and good beats. It's a good album to buy if you are just starting out in making the transition from pop music to punk.. Though, if you like New Found Glory, and bands like that, you are sure to like these guys."
4,Good Pump up Music,"this cd hasn't been getting the best reviews. this isn't frank sinatra, but these boys are entertaining. they play and sing well and have catchy rythems and lyrics like ""please just don't play with me, my paper heart will blead"" and ""this may be the last thing that i write for long, can you hear me smiling when i sing this song, for you, and only you. As i leave will you be some one to say goodbye, as i leaeve will you be one to wipe your eye.""Their song are funny, catchy and Tyson Ritter, the lead singer, is really HOT. this cdis constantally playing on my ipod, so if you like groups like simple plan, and good charlotte, most likely you will like this group of talented Oklahoma-ans."
4,"The All-American Rejects ""The All-American Rejects""","""My Paper Heart"" 5/5""Your Star"" 5/5""Swing, Swing"" 5/5""Time Stands Still"" 5/5""One More Sad Song"" 5/5""Why Worry"" 4/5""Don't Leave Me"" 4/5""Too Far Gone"" 4/5""Drive Away"" 5/5""Happy Endings"" 4/5""The Last Song"" 5/5The All-American Rejects' debut self-titled album is pop-punk at its best. Many people criticize this band because they're played on MTV and they're not quote on quote ""real punk."" This is ridiciulous because the band isn't trying to be anything other than what they are. Get over it.Overall rating: Four stars."
5,An All-American Album,"Ever wonder how great albums are made? First, every song on the album is written at top notch. Tyson Ritter probably didn't have that in mind when he sat down to write out this 11-track, punk/emo/pop album. Fortunately, it happened. Every song on the album from 1-11 is poetically written and suffices as one of the greatest albums about girls. Nick Wheeler didn't help making it much worse, and his rockin' guitar licks and solos are off the wall. Okay, so maybe he is no Angus Young on guitar, or Neil Peart on drums, but you would be surprised what he can put out in watts. A lot of the drums is electronic which adds to the uniqueness this band has. Mix Dashboard Confessionals with any power pop group and you have something close to The All-American Rejects, for AAR really isn't a mixture of anything. They aren't made of elements. They made the elements and mixed them. Simply brilliant."
5,ONLY 1 WORD FOR THIS....WOW!!,I CANT PUT THIS CD DOWN!! THEY ROCK!! THE VOCALS...GREAT!! THE GUITAR..GREAT!! I MEAN WOW!! THERE'S NO MORE TO SAY THEN WOW!!!! YOU SHOULD DEFFINETLY BUY THIS ALBUM!! IT ROCKS!! REJECTS OR NOT THEY ROCK!!
4,A new kind of sound... I like it!,"I really enjoyed the All-American Rejects' album. Though it is a tiny bit short at 11 songs, it's awesome. If you enjoy pop-punk, emo, whatever, you should realyl like it, too. My favorite songs are ""Swing Swing,"" ""One More Sad Song,"" and ""The Last Song."" I love those songs. ""My Paper Heart is awesome too though, as is ""Your Star."" The second half of the album falls a bit short. The only great song towards the end of the album is it's closer, ""The Last Song."" I like how they use different elements in their music. It makes their music sound more original than many other bands. It's diverse. Techno beats, pianos, orchestral instruments, and the organ (in ""Swing Swing"") add extra flavor to the album. That's how I see it anyway. Overall, I had to give this cd 4 stars. This is an awesome start for this band!"
5,Rejection,"This album is on my top ten list of new artist. This album covers the heart ache and emotions of a relationship in ""Swing, Swing"" while covering them in a up-beat rock frenzy.Then ""One More Sad Song"" will rock your socks off with its catchy guitar riffs and poeticly just lyrics. The Closing song ""The Last Song"" is a very well done midi orchestrated track. It reminds me of an old movie soundtrack. It definitely shows off the artistic and creativity side of the bands production on this album.The entire album gives you the feeling that you are not alone and helps you cope with the sadness of relationships and the heartache that comes with them!This band has some awesome talent. There is not one dull moment on this entire album.Check it out. Enjoy it. You Will Not be let down!!!!!"
4,"""happy endings"" for your ears","I first heard All-American Rejects on my favorite indie raidio station about three months ago, and I was instantly hooked. Who knew a band this cool could come out of Oklahoma?? The album rocks-- the lyrics are clever and fun, and the melodies will stay in your head for days, but in a good way. Anyone who's a fan of Weezer, NFG, OKGo, or Good Charlotte should check these guys out. ""Swing Swing"" will have you singing along the first time you listen to it, and you can't help but want to get up and dance around the room to ""The Last Song."" Every song on the album is well-written and has enough musical complexity and layering to keep your ears interested for multiple replays-- no simplistic three-chord punk riffs for AAR. There's only one thing I can't figure out about these guys-- how can they call themselves ""Rejects""??"
5,AAR rock! get em while they're hott!!,"Damn these guys are good! They've got it all; true to life lyrics, jamming guitars and well...let's admit it. They're hot. This album is nothing less than I would have expected from them. Unlike most CD's that have one or two good tracks and the rest is just put there to take up space, these guys' album doesn't stop. From the beginning of My Paper Heart to the end of The Last Song, these guys never quit. There's no doubt in my mind that these guys are going to go far and without a doubt I would recommend this album to everyone."
5,All american rejects rock,The all american rejects put out a really awesome cd. They are def one of my fav bands around right now.Whenever i listen to the CD i never want to turn it off.There is not one bad song on the cd. i really enjoy why worry and My paper heart. If you arent sure about buying this cd You really should It is one of the best on the market now.
5,"Awesome CD, must buy!","I saw the music video for ""Swing, Swing"" on LAUNCH a few weeks ago and it caught me. The song had an awesome sound to it including catchy lyrics. I downloaded it so I could listen to it over and over again. After going to about 4 different CD stores, I finally bought the CD. Popped it in my CD player and fell in love. My favorite is ""Happy Endings,"" it's great.I recommend this CD for anyone who loves Sum 41, Blink 182 or New Found Glory."
2,Poor music.,"When I first heard ""Swing, Swing"", I fell in love with TAAR. They sounded cool, they looked cool, so surely, their album had to be cool, right? I was sorely wrong. It was not worth my $9.00 at all. The only two outstanding songs that appealed to me was ""Swing, Swing"" and ""The Last Song"". The others made me cringe, even for a pop-punk lover such as myself.I would recommend you to download a couple of songs before deciding if you would really like to purchase this album."
5,Greatest cd of 2003!!!,"This cd is AMAZING!!!!!!! If you want something off the norm but still catchy than buy this cd. ""One More Sad Song"" is great. There is not alot you can write about this cd; it must be expirianced!"
1,1 word..AMAZING!,This CD is amazing.. i first heard my paper heart and totaly loved it...i bought this CD about 3 months ago..there's not 1 bad song on this CD...you will be extremely happy if you buy this CD!
1,Don't wast your time! Buy a Saving Face cd,I wouldn't waste the money on the cookie cutter junk. Support indie bands that say indie!Hey if you like punk check out Saving Face. Great diy band with out the agenda. New cd out now on High Fidelity Records.com or check out Saving face band . com
1,Worst band out of Oklahoma,"They have to be the worst band out of Oklahoma... I'm so tired of hearing their song on the radio 24/7... Has everyone forgotten the good bands out of Oklahoma such as The Flaming Lips, The Starlight Mints, and the Chainsaw Kittens? Tyson Ritter is nothing if you compare him to a good vocalist like Tyson Meade..."
1,It SUCKS!!!!!!,"They suck! the only song that sounds cool is swing swing, but the rest of the cd sucks"
1,Reject at all costs,"All-American Rejects is an awesome band name. That's about all the praise I feel I can honestly give to this CD. I know that this is technically emo, but does every single song have to be about the same thing? I can only listen to the same broken-hearted sentiment so many times before I get bored. I will admit that occaisonally they come up with an ok hook - ""The Last Song"" did impress me, but it might have just been the optimistic title. This is pure emo-pop banality that has been done many times with far more success, but of course the radio and MTV ate this up, and teenyboppers all over the country are raving about it. My advice to them would be to listen to The Movielife, an emo band with actual talent and creativity."
4,have fun ...,well i have to edmit when i bot this cd i was looking fore simpal plan. after serchin the endles line i cam acros all american rejects. i lisnd to a few songs and loved it. after lising to it a cupl times i was slitly disopionted but it never gets old fave song your star swimg swimg one more sad song and the last song. its nothing conpaired to GC's young and hoples or sum41's dus this look infected but hey go bye it have fun.
5,More like the Tyson Ritter is Hot Rejects!!,"He's really cute! On the CD:1. My Paper Heart: 8.5, it's good, but isn't my fave.2. Your Star: 7.5, cool beginning, but it sounds the same as many others and doesn't carry well.3. Swing, Swing: 10, no doubt, no need for explanation!!4. Time Stands Still: 8.5, same as My Paper Heart.5. One More Sad Song: 8.0, I like it, and it sounds like something you might play at a prom.6. Why Worry: 10, mellow, nice beginning, like Your Star, but unlike Your Star, it carries well!7. Don't Leave Me: 7.0, it really doesn't do anything to me.8. Too Far Gone: 6.5, this is my least favorite on the CD. Bleh.9. Drive Away: 7.0, like all, it's upbeat. But I don't love it.10. Happy Endings: 10, one of my favorites!! Kinda wintery feeling.11. The Last Song: 9.5, really cool beginning, and a good way to end the album.Notes: The songs are little all the same, but they're all good, and you'll love 'em! You'll catch on."
3,Okay stuff,The music is pretty cool but the lead singer's voice sounds like he's a [teenager] cuz he cracks a lot and like the songs are all about doomed relationships and how he wants them back. most people are gonna just plain hate it or love it. it's just up to you. don't listen to these poeple saying how they love it or hate it. you seriously have to go out and see for yourself.
5,AAR rocks!,"I first checked out AAR about a year ago, after lookin up bands on the web. i hadnt ever heard anything done by them- but i was so happy when i found them. this is sucha find and this cd is the best! its something almost everyone can listen to and enjoy and you wont take it out of your cd player for weeks! This is solid pop-rock through and through. this weezer-ish band with blink182-ish lyrics is clean enough to play in the car with your parents and not worry. these guys rock and you should definately buy the cd!. I guarentee that once you listen to this album a few times, you will not be able to get these songs out of your mind for a very, very long time. Well those are my thoughts... get the cd. enjoy it. have fun. i know you will!"
5,All-American Rejects,"Ive liked AAR for about a year, when i looked up some bands online that i had heard of (im into the unpopular punk bands). This is awesome pop-rock that u just have to rock out to. their kind of weezer ish sound with blink182ish lyrics make them a solid investment. I know that when u get this cd and u listen to it you will love the whole thing and not be able to turn it off!This band has awesome sounds, a unique use of light drums with everything u can imagine from violins to organs, plus it sounds great! I LOVE this album it is in my top 5 albums ever. I think almost everyone can enjoy this uplifting cd with its great (clean) lyrics. so us kids can play it in the car and not worry about our parents getting worried! well those are my thoughts on the band. buy the cd. check em out. you wont be dissapointed that you did"
5,Awesome punk-pop sound,"I bought the CD about two weeks ago and I can't get it out of the player. The catchy tunes stick in my brain all day long. Definately one of the best, hottest new groups out there. The All American Rejects have a sound unlike anyone else out there. The album is awesome!"
5,A must have,"The All American Rejects, although being around for a few years, recently released there first major self titled CD! It consists of a handful of catchy songs anyone you know will enjoy. They have an Emo-Punk sound, very similiar to that of Dashboard Confessional with a Something Corporate twist, so if you like these two bands or at least familiar with them, i guarentee you will enjoy the songs and sound of The All American Rejects"
4,great,this cd is great. its calming but not boring. the vocals on this cd r the best. its one of those cds you can listen to over and over! and sing along if u like that.
5,absolutely phenomenal,"I would 100% recommend this CD to anyone who would listen to me. Music has and always will mean the world to me and AAR is the type of band that makes you fall in love with lyrics and a good tune all over again. And i heard the album BEFORE i realized that Tyson is beautiful, so that also says a lot :)"
2,"Mediocre, at best","Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad CD. It's just not a good one. All of the songs sound the same, and it's not because the band has a unique sound. They are very much a pop rock band, and don't really bring anything new or interesting to the genre. This CD is best suited for background noise while you're doing something else."
5,BUY IT,"I LOVED IT! great lyrics, great rhythms, and if you check out their website[...] Buy it now, you wont regret it!"
3,Hmmmmmm.....,"Well, I guess this cd was ok. The songs are catchy and are headbobbing foottapping things, but the songs are repetitive and full of clichés. Although Tyson Ritter is really hot and he does have an ok voice."
5,Great cd!,"This cd is one of my favorites! The All-American-Rejects are a very talented band. My favorite songs are My Paper Heart, Swing Swing, Time Stands Still, and One More Sad Song. I love all the songs on this cd though! There's not one bad song on this cd! It's definatly worth buying."
1,*NSYNC at level 2,The All American Rejects are basically *NSYNC pushed to the new level.This isn't really a bad thing though but they are just lacking anything original.They're songs are also repetive in lyrics.Each song is just another heart broken rhyme after another and it gets really really boring after a short time.The songs are somewhat catchy for hardcore or casual pop fans though.I'm just not a huge pop fan but this is a decent effort for pop at least.
2,What The??,"I like The All American Rejects but they are to softie.I cant really believe they call this punk rock,or even rock!Most of the time youll here bells!?!The only song thats sounds like rock is The Last Song and maybe Swing,Swing.My mouth literally droped when I put on this cd.This cd should definitley go in the pop category."
2,don't bother buying...download first,"I heard the first single, ""swing, swing,"" off The All American Rejects debut CD and was blown away. It was an awesome mix of power/pop weezer with the pop sensisbility of Jimmy Eat World. I loved it. After purchasing it I found something completely different. There's maybe one or two other ""tolerable"" songs on the album that's about it. The rest are all pop/punk dribble. sorry kids...the rejects need to be left alone."
1,Pansy Rock,"Just another crappy MTV band that caters to the female demographic with sappy, cheesy, corny, lyrics. Go open your mind and listen to music that actually takes risks and challenges you."
1,why waste your time,"the reason this cd got rated a 1 is because there is no 0. i listen to this cd and it was the worst thing ever made if you have money to waste your better off paying someone to beat you up. way do you want to listen to someone who sounds like every third note he just got busted in the balls its more annoying then anything. if you want some good music buy any CKY, HIM, BLOODHOUND GANG. if you are 12 or under this cd is ok for you to have anyone over 12 with it needs punched and handed a good taste of music. force change now"
2,|2.5| Not even good for a pop-punk album.,"There is nothing here that a 9 year old girl won't like, but even for the average pop-punk or emo fan, this album is a stinker. Repetitive, boring, simple, yawn, repeat. The chords are all the same, the lyrics are all the same, and the album is short. All-American Rejects? Exactly. Thumbs down."
1,BAD BAD,THE ALL AMERICAN REJECTS. THE WORST BAND IN THE WORLD. INSTEAD OF THIS BUY ST ANGER THE METALLICA CD THE KINGS OF HEAVY METAL INSTEAD OF THE QUEENS OF SOFT PILLOW REJECTS ALL AMERICAN REJECTS I MEAN!
1,Perfect Band Name,"This is utter trash , no aggresiveness , attitude , originality or even a decent riff/groove . If you like Rock music stay away from this because there is nothing rockin' about it , especially the nasal whine of the lead singer and where IS the bass ??"
4,AAR Rocks,"i have just went out and bought this cd. it kicks ...!!! my all time favorite is swing, swing. other that i like are my paper heart, drive away, and one more sad song. i love this cd!!!!!"
5,Something New,"I'm glad this band has some of the old style, with new lyrics. they don't follow the traditional music."
4,kick a$$ band,"I think there an awesome band. every song has a great pop/rock hook that stays with you through the album. My favorite song has to be ""one more sad song"" and ""my paper heart"". definetly check this out if your into pop/rock kind of music."
5,An awsome cd!,"The All-American Rejects Cd has happy up beat songs like Swing, Swing and Happy Endings. If you like Jimmy Eat World and Good charlotte, check out this cd!!! It is my new Favorite!"
3,"Good, but it gets old... FAST","When I first purchased this album after hearing the oh-so catchy ""Swing Swing,"" I was floored. I thought it was just so good! It was happy, and catchy, and all those wonderful things. But after having it for about a month, all that sugary-pop just got to me. I couldn't stand to hear them on the radio, let alone play their CD. This was months ago, and only recently have I been able to bring myself to listen to it again.Disregarding my experience for a minute, the standout songs are: ""my paper heart"" (so cute...), ""swing swing"" (how can you not love this song?), ""why worry"" (fantastic slow, emotional song) and ""happy endings"" (i love how unusual this song is... its so interesting). This album has a nice flow, and it is very good, but you have to be really happy to stomach it for long periods of time. I would say sure, buy it, but listen with caution..."
3,All-American rockstars,"this CD is absolutely incredible!its the only CD i don't get sick of listening to over and over again!The lyrics really come from the heart and deal w/ real issues, unlike many of today's 'hottest' singers/groups.All-American Rejects write about issues i can relate to, w/ out making the lyrics corny or typical of other groups.I highly recommend this CD to everyone and can only wait for the day when i conjure up enough money to see them perform live!"
1,koool de all amerkijn rejecs r kol,mme and my frends dacnce 2 all amerkin rjeks.it kol.buye it at wal marte.
1,They really ... bad,"How bad can one band be? They don't deserve fan. There singer started playing bass like not even a year ago, and he is now some famous joke. How unfair is that? There are way better bands out of Oklahoma like the Chainsaw Kittens, and the Flaming Lips. I don't know why they are put into the punk genre? They sound nothing like a punk band...."
2,"Better luck next time, AAR","I bought this CD out of support for the local music. It wasn't worth the money. The album lacks variation; it is almost like listening to the same song over and over. The only good tracks are ""Swing Swing"" and ""One More Sad Song"". I give the band props for ""making it"", but Stillwater has better music and less arrogant musicians to offer."
1,dont campare em to *nsync,"Nsync is better any day than these poseurs.i hate these guys.After buying this record i thought it might be kool because i heard they are like *nsync and well yeah they are kinda like *nsync with guitars BUT THEY ARE NOT AS GOOD.If you want some good music,go buy a Nsync,justin Timberlake or Britany Spears record because this is just a pop band full of poseurs :("
5,THIS CD ROCKS MY SOCKS OFF!!,"The All-American Rejects (AAR) may just be a small band from Oklahoma but their music is HUGE. Their danceable tunes and upbeat rhythms make this cd worthwhile. All of the songs were written by lead singer Tyson Ritter after breaking up with his girlfriend. The lyrics of the cd are easy to relate to also. There is no word to describe this cd except GREAT. If you are looking for a cd full of rock and excitement, I highly recommend this cd."
5,Kick A$$ CD,This Cd is one of the best Cd's I've heard in a while. The songs are about real life and are great to listen to. It's a great CD and I encourgae you to buy it!!
5,AAR rocks!,"This CD is the catchiest, best CD that I've heard in a long time. Filled with music that can be described as pop, emo, and rock, all at the same time. And Tyson's voice is just .. really, really nice. *lol* Great songs, great lyrics, great music!"
5,"great guys, great music","although the other reviews are great and true, i know i dont have the attention span to read all those long reviews. so to make it short and sweet. the guys rock, they're oober nice, and they put on an amazing live show. if u don't own this cd, i dont know what's wrong with u, but buy it..NOW. go out and see them live too! most importantly though, listen to the lyrics- they're beautiful! =o)"
3,Okay but REALLY sappy,"Nothing against these guys, but every song is about 'oh my girlfriend just broke up with me boo hoo. mope. whine.' It's okay when I 'm super-bored or depressed or sometimes cleaning my room. Some people are saying if you like blink-182 to check these guys out but I have NO idea where that comparrison came from. Maybe they were ONLY comparing swing swing to an Enema song. Obviously, it wasn't based off blink's latest effort. If you are looking for some good pop-punk check out blink or maxeen or the starting line because they rock. If you are super-duper mainstream and also depressed this cd is totally for you."
5,All American Rejects- Great Band,"I odn't care what all of the negative people say, but I truly believe that the All-American rejects are a great band. It can't be classified as pop, yet it c an't be classified as rock. I also think the lyrics were well written. It's one of the few CDs that I can listen to from beginning to the end, and liking every song. Some of my favorites including Paper Heart and the Last Song. Overall, a great CD for anyone who can't decide between pop and rock."
4,I Like It,"From the start I have never been a huge punk fan. Especially with all those negative lyrics that are just so fake. I grew up listening to the old guys like Bruce Springstein, Green Day,etc. But let me tell you these guys are good. I mean there singing could get better but overall there not that bad. They create a poppish side to punk and talk about love like the old bands use to do. I'll recommend this to anyone.You won't be disappointed. Favorite Songs...Swing Swing and the Last Song"
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"I bought this album after only hearing one song, with the remainder of a gift card. I was expecting a mediocre CD, and instead I got an incredible album which has become one of my favorites. It's got a fun pop-punk-emo sound and the songs are really catchy, getting stuck in my head for days. It's worth much more than the price!"
3,Sing about something else!,"The band is obviously talented, but come on fellas, can you write a song about anything else besides love, or falling in love, or losing love, or being unloved, or anthing not dealing with love? At first it's ok, but after an entire alubum of pseudo love songs, listeners are sick of it. The constant love-themed tracks almost become annoying, detracting from the music itself. Yeah, love is a good thing I guess, but if you liked cars, you wouldn't write an entire album about cars and expect it to sell very well. People would get sick of it. All those love songs become sickly sweet, like eating too much candy. Eventually, too much of a good thing makes you barf."
5,My new obsession...,The All American Rejects CD is filled with songs that teenagers can relate to and the melodies are catchy with strong and powerful backgrounds and awesome lyrics to match. I recommend this CD to anyone. It rocks my freaking socks... I love it. The All American Rejects are a...talented band.
5,I'm speechless...,"I'd never heard of the All-American Rejects untill a friend mentioned them. Soon after, I heard their single ""Swing, Swing"" on the radio. After hearing the first few chords, I immediately fell in love with this band. The lyrics are inspiring and the music is downright well-written! After hearing that one song on the radio, I went out and bought the CD and I've been listening to it ever since!"
3,The All-American Rejects,"Now that emo has truly and irrevocably gone mainstream, fans have two choices: 1) Whine about it online and dismiss all major-label releases as hypocritical sellouts like punker-than-thou elitists; or 2) Accept it, move on, and judge the albums on their own merits.If you prefer 1), avoid this debut album from The All-American Rejects.If, however, you endorse 2), you could do worse than these Oklahoma youngsters.On the one hand they're accessible, with the big hooks, bittersweet melodies, catchy choruses and plaintive vocals of a poppier Dashboard Confessional, Get Up Kids or Jimmy Eat World. On the other, they're slightly innovative, incorporating squishy synth effects and squirrely beatboxes into their sound to separate them from the backpack pack.Sure, they aren't exactly reinventing the wheel here -- but they aren't the rejects they paint themselves as."
3,"Good tunes, same tunes","After hearing the popular ""Swing, Swing"" so many times, I thought this CD would have other good tracks. All of songs are well played and have a catchy tune, but all 11 tracks are too much of the same thing. If you put it in a CD player, after the 5th song or so, the melancholy tones begin to sound repetitive, and can sometimes be annoying. The best use for this CD was mixing the best songs on my playlist with other rock bands."
2,Ehh,"These guys are alright. They'd be better if the lead singer didn't sound like he was getting kicked in the balls everytime he hits a note, but w/e. Their songs are catchy and stuff, but the problem is they dont have any aggression. Their kind of like Simple Plan but AAR are slightly better musicians."
5,THE BEST BAND OUT IN THE ROCK INDUSTRY!!!,"The All-American Rejects are the best band out in the rock industry right now! i think they kick some major butt..they have an awesome sound. no other band can top their sound, they jus rock!ive seen them in concert in orlando @ the house of blues on Saturday, Febuary 15, and they were sooo unbelievably awesome!! they have music that everyone will enjoy..it jus makes u have a good time listening to them.. i bought their self titled cd ""The All-American Rejects and i give it a 5 star rating and an 15 on a 1-10 scale..i love this band and i can already tell they are gonna become big and hey all the guys in the band are hott! hehe but hey thats jus my oppinion. i highly reccomend u to go and buy there self titled album "" The All-American Rejects"" i garuntee you'll like them as much as i do, so go out and buy there cd YOU WONT REGRET IT ..."
3,Bland pop,"U may be surprised by the three stars but despite being unispired and unoriginal this cd does have some good tunes, I love swing swing but their arent really any other standouts, Despite this they dont have one poor song, just the odd one u like a little bit less. One major problem with this album is that when u listen to it u get ready to sing the chorus but u sing the rong one. All the songs sound the same, then again this is not a bad thing if u like them all. The all american rejects could b a very gd band if they exten their lyrics to things other than relationships and got rid of the drum machine which is painfully obvous on some songs( my paper heart)All in all this isnt a standout album but not a waste of money"
1,What Is This?,"This is pure crap. For one, the singer cannot sing. Why does every other note have to be falsetto? Electronic drums (a la the beginning of ""Time Stand Still"")...are you kidding me? All the ""oooo ooo""s in ""Why Worry"". ARRRGHH. I had to stop listening after to the CD at that point. This is far worse than any ""pop-punk"" label you can put on this music, in fact, who even says this is ""pop-punk"". If you like pop-punk, then surely you can realize NFG, GC, Starting Line, or for that matter, ANY POP-PUNK GROUP, at least can rock on a few songs. If you don't even like the style of those groups (TAAR is much cheesier), then don't even bother downloading a few tracks from this to test this CD out. Try Senses Fail, Fall Out Boy, Northstar, Don't Look Down, Autopilot Off, or Rufio if you are not ready to really rock your head off with harder punk groups yet, but want to get away from this garbage and at least listen to music."
1,My friends were right,"my friends told me that these guys are bad. i agreed because i had inadvertantly heard some song like ""swing, swing"" and it was crappy. then, some other friends of mine liked this band, and we made fun of them. so now, i actually listened to the little clips on this site. all the songs sound the smae. the singer has zero talent and the guitars have no imagination. they are just wanna-be simple plan (who suck too)."
2,Poor,"...I suppose there are some good moments... Some of the tracks are decent, like ""Why Worry"", ""Don't Leave Me"" or ""The Last Song"". But the rest of it is unimaginative, boring ..."
5,Party Hearty,"Believe it or not: Listening to Tyson Ritter's *magical* voice has caused eruptions of feelings and sensations which have been dormant for years. Rock on, Rejects. Rock on."
5,ALL AMERICAN REGECTS ARE AWESOME,I am really into the rock and punk scene and i just discovered All American Regects and its been a greta journey. They ahve slower songs and the faster songs. They also throw in some computer effects into their music. I know people of all ages who have fallen inlove with them. In my oppion its the best cd of the year.
5,awesome cd from an awesome new band,"i first heard ""swing swing"" on MMUSA, and i immediately was hooked--after hearing a few songs, i went out and bought the cd and was blown away...great cd, you can listen to it all the way through, and all the songs don't sound the same...favorites are 'swing swing' and 'one more sad song'---you will not be disappointed w/ this cd!"
1,USPS lost the package,USPS lost the original shipment. Amazon customer service replaced the watch. Very happy with Amazon speedy solution to the ploblem of USPS sloppy handling of the original shipment
3,Wish to Buy,"Hello,laptop configuration is good,wish to buy tell me what will be the best price .also with all payment conditions."
3,Strategic management concepts and cases,"A study and conceptual analysis of the key aspects strategic management, strategic planning, corporate strategy, business scope, model building, marketing and sales. Contains topics on concept of strategy and strategic planning, corporate strategy, business policy and strategy, investment evaluation and strategy, business scope, model building, framework for strategy, organization for corporate planning and marketing strategy among others."
3,"A dry read, but good information","Economic history is a tough slog for me, and this book was no exception to that, but Overy does make an interesting argument about the role economic development played in both Stalin's regime and the Third Reich. Honestly, though, I think you have to be an economic historian to really get in to this book. As a social historian, this one was a tough go."
4,The Red and the Brown,"I found this book to be a good comparison between the internal structures of two societies that both careened off the road of civilization at about the same time. The author does seem to give too much credit to the formal, but unobserved, laws on the books in the Soviet experiment when comparing the two dictatorships. However, his chapter on the economic structure of both regimes helped me understand this aspect of Hitler's rule.After a describing the worst of the camps, I think the word ""evil"" might have emerged from Professor Overy as one possible explanation of what occured."
4,"Very Informational, but a little too informational...","The Dictators, of course, porvided a lot of information about Stalin and Hitler, but one thing was prevailant throughout the book: numbers. The facts Richard Overy presented to the reader left little to be doubted about his thesis, but also it was hard to understand them (and it blocked the flow). I rate this 4 stars because although my criticisms may be harsh, it taught me much about Hitler and Stalin, it will serve as a good reference book, and I may want to reread it when I have a fuller understanding of the two Dictators. (This is coming from a 10th Grade history enthusiast)"
1,Not for NiCad,This device WILL NOT charge NiCad batteries such as those furnished with solar lights. It will give a RED error code. This is only for Nickel Metal Hydride NI MH batteries.
4,Very good product,"Good price, good product. Just pay attention for which camera model this product apply. Unfortunately, I didn't do it and it didn't fit for my Kodak."
3,Worked well while it lasted,The charger works very well but the batteries don't last very long. I will never use a Kodak camera again. Just my 2 cents...
4,packaging-new?,"So far the charger and battery are working as advertised. However the product arrived just wrapprd in plastic not the manufacturers packing,I found this unusual because it was sold new as 12.49 + shipping."
4,Solid product - worth the investment!,"Purchased this for my 85yo mom so that her camera wouldn't have to live on the dock - and so that she could charge while on the road. Bought the combo to also replace her original battery that had worn out. Good product - reliably works - worth the investment, especially if you travel."
1,horrible deceptive selling,"this was advertised to be compatable with my camera, and it is not. I am very dissapointed and will never order from Amazon again."
4,"Great katana, frustrating problems.","The katana is great, and very strong. The only problen was that, on the end of the blade, there was a 6 inch long patch of what looked like rust. I had to use a extremely high grit sandpaper to get off. Otherwise, it is very beautiful, can take a beating, and is overall a great sword."
4,"Overall, a good sword","I fully got my thirty dollars worth from this sword. (price + shipping) Cosmetic things were not great, such as the metal bits on the bottom of the scabbard and hilt, but this turned out to be fortunate because it allowed me to tighten the screw keeping the blade in the hilt.If the sword is actually being used to hit things, I would advise keeping the blade tight in the hilt, and making sure the hilt does not twist while swinging the sword. The blade is not the strongest, as I found while hitting a wooden post after the handle was askew, and bending the blade at a 90 degree angle. Still, it is a quite good sword, especially for the low cost."
4,Tip #1: Buy This Book,"As a teacher, one learns to live on a modest salary; stretching the dollar becomes an art more than a science. However, this book provided me with ways to make even my most stringent budget seem like my cup had run over! Everything from trimming household bills to discounts at retail stores. It even helped me buy my first car for less than my husband bought his (and they're the same make/model!). A top-notch resource for the financially challenged or penny-wise!"
3,Statements by various religious denominations,"WORDS OF CONSCIENCE, published by the Center on Conscience and War, is a compilation of official statements on conscientious objectors by several dozen religious denominations large and small in the U.S. With it, one can easily see what a particular church has too say about conscientious objector. For example, under the heading ""Greek Orthodox"" we find a statement by the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North America to the effect that, while the Church does not oppose all forms of war, it does allow its members to apply as conscientious objectors under certain circumstances.The book also contains notable statements by individuals on conscientious objection, such as Edna St Vincent Millay's famous poem, and essays by the Dalai Lama and pope John Paul II. Various editions of the book exist, and this listing regrettably doesn't specify the latest. The edition I am reviewing is the eleventh, published in 2001."
5,A unique rendition of the Nativity story,"Fine's language is magical. She's included sensory details, universal feelings, humor, and strong characterization in the form of her cranky cricket in the stable that night. Her unique rendition of this age-old story is a ""must"" for holiday gifts for children; adults will love it, too. Winslow Pels's illustrations are stunning, right down to the donkey's eyelashes."
3,One of the better generation lost world stories.,Many movies and novels have been written about the colony type ships and their trips to the stars. This 1967 novel is a fine example of this type of novel.
3,Until it burst,"I loved this ball, until it burst. I loved its large diameter, its smart orange skin, the way it filled so quickly with air. But five months after I first pumped life into the ball, in the middle of a workout, I heard a slow, sad whisper from above my ear. One of the ribs had snagged and torn on my clean-clipped fingernail! I considered purchasing another, but after some thought, my next ball should probably be one with thicker skin."
1,It sprang a leak!,"This ball arrived and it was OK that it wasn't pumped up. The pump was very difficult to use, though, and I had a very hard time getting a good grip on it. Then my sons took the ball outside for a quick run around the house one day. They didn't realize that it shouldn't have gone outside for any reason. And sure enough, even though I paid the price for the Burst resistant ball, it sprang a slow leak and became completely unusable. So I folded it up and put it back in the box. It was a very expensive lesson to learn. I wish I could get my money back."
2,I'm an idiot!,I already have the cd with this song on it..this is only one song played 4 different ways..It came fast in the mail and has no problems. But I don't need it.
2,good-old-boy anecdotes but not much about how to drive,"This book is full of photos of Bob sliding old cars around on the track, and posing with other great old drivers. Some of the anecdotes are real hooters. But it's skinny on the ""how to"" parts. There's a lot of discussion about setting up your seat and pedals for a comfortable and efficient driving position, but not much about the specifics of choosing a line for this corner, in this car, in this weather, today. Not much about footwork or other aspects of driving technique, not much about car set-up, and nearly nothing about the physics underlying it all. A few glancing blows at topics like contact patches, but disappointingly little.Skip Barber's ""Going Faster"" is a better textbook, especially for someone like me, an engineer with an analytical mindset.If you want a driving textbook, get Barber's. If you want driving stories, get Bondurant's."
2,Save your money for a pepperoni pizza,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about high performance driving without the cost of going to a school, but roughly half of this book is just advertisement of Bob's driving school in Southern California. For example, on controlling skids, he talks very little about how to get out of a skid and then he begins on how you can learn more if you come to his driving school because the school has such and such equipments. There's even an entire chapter dedicated to how to graduate from his driving school. He also seems to be obssessed with his past glory, which he doesn't mind spending time to talk about. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE."
3,"Excellent, But Only For Beginners","I found this book to be an excellent starting point for anyone interested in doing some Road-Racing. It teaches you proper lines, braking, posture, etc... However, if you have raced, or have taken part in a racing school, this book is basically a waste of time, unless you like reading about what a great driver Bob Bondurant was(or is). And trust me, the book tries to make him look like he's the best driver that ever lived.(Which we all know is Michael Schumacher). Anyways, the book is entertaing, yet I would not recommend it to the experienced road racer."
1,Cool anectodes but fairly useless for learning driving techniques,"I've read a lot of books about Performance driving/racing techniques lately and I have to say that this one pretty much ranks at the bottom.It is a well written biography about Bondurants life (a whole chapter in the book, and intersperced throughout the text), but lacks on much useful information on driving and racing techniques. After reading a lot of other books on this topic I feel that this one is fairly light on actual information and driving techniques in comparison. It is more up to date though than some books written on this topic. I would probably recommend Carl Lopez'/Skip Barber's book ""Going Faster"" Or Piero Taruffi's book ""The technique of Motor Racing(Driving)"" and similar titles over Bondurant's book. It does make a quick read and an introduction to the sport though."
1,SIGNED copy of Bob Bondurant on High Performance Driving,"This was NOT a signed copy of the book..... The book was fine and interesting to read, but the item was not as advertised in the title of the sale."
2,ummmm...don't waste your time,"Bob Bondurant on Bob Bondurant.A 90-page book which spends the first 32 pages name-dropping about all the celebrities and famous people Bob Bondurant hangs out with, and all the cool cars he owns. The next 60 pages are spent telling you again and again...and again, how Bob Bondurant is going to teach you to be a better driver. Very little time is spent actually teaching you how to be a better driver."
2,Nothing new,"Shameless advertising of Driving School and associated sponsors/products, nowhere near enough focus on the art of car control. The content taught me nothing I didn't already know, and even that was in poor detail. The few images that are used as examples to explain various controls and actions where extremely dated and unclear. While any 'current' images would have to be straight out of a brochure for said driving school. A lot of Red Herrings that have little, if any, relevance to topic being discussed. Merely self promotion. There are many other publications that explore and explain performance driving much more clearly and concisely."
2,You will only learn by going to the track,"Too much anecdotal prose ruins the foundation for a good book. But in my opinion, you really only learn things like high performance driving by taking a course or three, putting in regular practice at a track, and in other driving exercises like autocrosses.Interesting tidbits from Bob's driving career, but I don't learn well from anecdotes. Perhaps you might"
5,VERY USEFUL TO UNDERSTAND HOW A CAR RUNS,"I WAS PRESENTED THIS BOOK FROM ONE OF MY BEST FRIEND. I'VE APPRECIATED HIM UNTIL NOW. IT WAS A FIRST BOOK ABOUT DRIVING FOR ME. IT DESCRIBES WELL HOW YOU CAN MANAGE WEIGHT-TRANSFER OF YOUR CAR, HOW THE TIRE PRESSURE AND GRIP CHANGES WHILE CARS ARE RUNNING, HOW TO USE BASIC RACING SKILLS LIKE HANDLING, DOUBLE CLUTCH, HEEL AND TOE AND STUFF. IT WILL MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND BASIC RACING SKILLS AND MAKE YOU ADAPT THIS TO YOUR CAR ON THE STREET. AND IT'S VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND. BUY IT NOW!"
5,ER 6th season,"I absolutely love ER. I missed it in the 90's and any thing done after, as I don't have television where I live and haven't for years. I just love all of the episodes and seasons. It just gets better and better each season. They have really captured true life. The episodes are clearly written with much feeling and true to life situations. They are realistic and I can't wait to watch the next episodes. I can hardly wait for the 7th season to be released. It is great to watch with my family. We discuss some of the situations and what would you do in their shoes. I have teenagers and it lets them have an idea of what can happen in life. Thanks so much to the writers and actors for letting me escape my world."
4,enjoyed the story line--DVD was fine and it was definitely worth the money. I recommend the whole series.,The sound and picture quality was fine. This DVD compares admirably to the other DVD's in the series. Other doctor series would be most interesting.
4,GREAT!,"ER is an amazing show and everyone should at least watch it once! Every character is interesting and a lot of the scenes feel real, not just tv drama."
2,Content doesn't live up to title.,"The first thing that you'll notice when you get this book is that all the printing is double-spaced so the book could easily have taken up half the number of pages. The second thing is that there are a lot of quotations from ""The Art of War"". I guess the author figures by defining some martial art terms and by quoting from a famous book that paintball could be tied to martial arts. It is an interesting twist but this book falls very short. The book does cover some paintball tactics but they are elementary and probably only useful for ""white belt"" paintballers. By far the best thing about this book is the cool looking front and back cover illustrations. At [$$], about the cost of two hoppers full of balls, the book might be considered useful to those beginning paintball...just don't take the martial arts part too serious."
1,The only book you will need!,I just started playing paintball and this gave me all the info I needed. It was clear and clever and now I have what it takes to wipe put the opposition! I would reccomend this to anyone that has an interset in paintball.
3,I really liked it....when it worked.,"I bought this item for my nursery and at first, I really liked it. It worked well and I tried to clean it as directed. However, it stopped working after 4 or 5 weeks. The reason, though, could be my fault because I was carrying it while full. But my husband doesn't think it's my fault. We could take it to an authorized somebody to fix it, but that would probably cost more than I paid for it. I'm without a humidifier now, but I liked that this one was easy to clean (no filter), lasted about two days without needing to be filled, and was really cute. My baby loved to look at it."
3,It is very cute but hard to fill it..,"It is very cute and my daughter loves it. It has good humidifier functions but it is hard to fill it up. There are openings on top of eyes where steam comes out of, when you fill it up with water, it comes out of them too. so I had to tilt it until I get to the main unit in my kid's room so that I don't drip water all over. But over all, it is good value for the money you pay, and it is easy to clean, and great for kids' rooms."
3,Worked great while it lasted!,"I was so happy with this humidifier at first! 4 months after I started using it, the knob stopped turning the machine on and off. It just turns and turns. There is no reasoning for this, it worked just fine when I turned it on at bedtime. When I went to turn it off in the morning, it just started spinning. My husband rigged it so that when it's plugged in, it's on full blast. It'll work that way for us for the rest of the winter, but we'll have to replace it after that. Very disappointed, such a cute humidifier!"
4,Cutie Penguin- A Quiet Convenience :),"I got this little guy a few years ago for my dorm room; I was staying in the mountains which were very cold and the heating made our room VERY dry..This humidifier was very good- quiet, and didn't have the water beading up problem that I've encountered before with other humidifiers.. I think, though, that he'd be best at a normal sized bedroom- a dorm room may have been too big. Also, the cord is a bit short, and- in my infinite wisdom- I forgot to get something to put him on.. If he's just on the ground, the water mist can't really spread anywhere..Still, a sturdy little guy, and, of course, quite cute to look at! Recommended for a child's room, definitely!"
3,"Pretty decent and cheap, and very cute","I have only a little more to add to the many other reviews: The fan is very quiet, but like many other humidifiers there is a constant dripping sound that I find annoying. The plastic case acts like a resonator and makes it much louder than it needs to be. I should not really say that the dripping sound is LOUD, but it is certainly audible in a quiet room, and I find it annoying. Others may not be bothered, but I think it sounds like a dripping faucet in the same room."
5,Lovely and works well,"First of all, its super cute. I am a huge hello kitty fan, so I bought this.surprisingly, it also works well. Quite, easy to use, steam come out in no time.The first one broke in a week, because I had it on for 12 hours. The light burnt or something. But then, thanks to Amazon, they replaced a new one in no time. Now I just avoid using the light and I am now using this hello kitty humidifier happily ever."
1,"Plastic cracked, water leaked all over the place.","This humidifier worked great the first time we used it. My daughter has a cold and we brought it out again, the second night the plastic water reservoir cracked badly and about half a gallon of water leaked out. I read other reviews and we are not the first to experience this problem. Apparently the company doesn't pay shipping for returns so it's not even worth returning it and going through the hassle.I would not buy this product again.Also it did not originally come with the water filtering cartridge so I had to buy it separately."
2,Short Life Span,"It's adorable and works great! I used it mostly at night when I sleep. However, the motor will die within a year. So only buy it, if you don't mind spending the money to replace it every year."
1,The farce of the penquins,"Pretty lame. My wife goes to set it up, ""it's leaking"". OK- I go and try my hand. Leaking like a sieve without plugging it in yet. Besides it leaking- why would anyone design the water fill on the bottom of the tank? And putting a decorative handle on an egg shape (holding a gallon of water +/-) and then saying don't use it as a handle? 1 out of 100 ( the one is for the limited cute factor). Not a good buy."
3,crane humidifier,"I just received this item yesterday and was quite pleased with the packaging. However, when I started using it last night, a similar problem occurred multiple times. The humidifier shuts off by itself (green light turn red) every approximately 2hrs, sometimes shorter. So far I have not figured out what the problem is."
5,Works great,"I've had this for about a week, and it's been working great. Love that you can see the mist coming out if you turn it up high enough. If we keep it up almost on high, we have to fill it up once a day, if we turn it down lower then we don't have to fill it up as often. We have it sitting in our living room right now because we have a fireplace and this is where we have our little one at more than anywhere else in the house."
3,sufficient,Love the look because I'm in love with Hello Kitty. Only used for one night so far doesnt give out as much air as the Elephant. Maybe because it comes out of two ears and not one trunk. But if your looking for the air to hit you more I would go with another model. It does work though and the night light is awesome.
3,Good humidifier w/ a small problem,"Worked great until it became clogged. It might be user error or our own water, but it sucks that we used it for less than a year. Otherwise, it is a great product as the air flow can be adjusted and its cute. :)"
3,Cleaning it is a pain!,"This humidifer is cute, does a good job and runs very quietly. The reason I am only giving it three stars is because water always ends up spilling out when we turn it over to set it on it's base and it's very hard to clean. You really need to clean out the base area of this humidifer about once a week or it grows this white mold inside. We clean it regularly, but it's no easy task."
3,worked 1 day,"This humidifier worked perfectly for 1 day. The next day when I turned it on, it worked for 2-3 hours, then it stopped working. I thought because it ran out of water, so I refilled the tank, it worked for 5 minutes, then it stopped. I shaked it, it worked, for another 5 minutes. So I have to shake it every 5 minutes to have it worked.I called the customer service, and luckily the lady was nice. She asked me what model that I bought and said that she's going to send the replacement part on the same day. I guess this is a common problem for the cow model because she knew it right away when I said the cow model."
1,Junk,"What a hunk o junk. Stopped working. When it did work it wasn't great, too messy.i noticed there are a lot of reviews. this company made a lot of money producing trash, cheating all of us at the same time. This company should be banish from America!"
1,Broke after the very first use,"My kids really loved it. But, unfortunately broke right after the first use! I had seen couple of reviews saying it broke after first use. But, I thought those may be rare case.I called Amazon, they plan to refund. But, pain to spend time to find another one. I badly need one. Unfortunately this service was not reliable :-("
1,Broke the 2nd day of use,"Worked great the first night and by night two, it made a noise like it was TRYING to work, but no mist was coming out."
5,4th year - Still works great,"I would never spend on toy like anything unless they are real toys. But I got this at very low price and it had good reviews. I did not go wrong with my investment.Pros:Looks nice in kids room. When its on, its a real huffing and puffing train, except it does not move. Kids like that.The tank come with handle, easy to carry and fill. The handle slides back into the tankworks great.Adjustable outputcons: Not so easy to clean. When on full output, water puddles near the unit.Some helpful hints:Place humidifier at least 2feet above ground, and it helps to circulate nicely if it is near air vent.Turn on ceiling fan (winter mode, reverse spin) at low speed.No more stuffy noses and dry skin"
2,"Effective, but Loud","This little guy puts out an adequate amount of vapor, but it's extremely LOUD. The motor sounds like a car engine and the water tank is constantly gurgling. I've never heard anything like it! I thought I might get used to the sound, that it would become ""white noise,"" but that has not happened. I would not recommend this for an adult, unless you are a very sound sleeper, and I think it's out of the question for a baby."
2,MOLD,"We got this humidifier because of our new baby and it worked great for a while. However, after 2 nights of high fever and pains in my chest, I examined the humidifier and found mold. Needless to say we decided perhaps this isn't the bet fit for us and immediately stopped using it."
4,Like,"Item arrived when promised. Used it several times and it is not what I hoped for. But it is a good product, good price and most importantly arrived on time."
5,awesome,"this works sooo well make sure you dont turn it up all the way,it set off my smoke detectors. My son now sleeps thru the night due to the air in his room being nice and moist."
3,Soaking wet.,"I like the fine mist and how quiet this humidifier is, but holy cow- it gets the carpet soaking wet, and everything around it very wet... I have to lay a towel underneath it to protect my floor, or table or whatever its on. I've never had this problem with other humidifiers- I think its becuase the mist doesnt shoot high up into the air. It just slowly flows out so it just lands on the floor. But it is very quiet and the mist is very fine."
3,"Some Good, Some Bad","We've had 3 different Crane humidifiers for our boys' rooms: Frog, Dog, and Dragon. The Frog lasted for 2 years running pretty much non stop. It was amazing. The motor finally started getting loud and not working as well as it had so we replaced it with the Dragon. The Dragon worked great for the first winter and then we put it into storage (after thoroughly cleaning and drying it out). Just took it out this week and it doesn't work correctly. The motor runs loudly and makes the water compartment to be very hot. Also no mist comes out. We checked and there are no clogs anywhere. So in the trash its going. The dog is doing fine despite having not having been used all summer. Very disappointed about the Dragon considering the life of the Frog. 5 stars for our experience with the Frog, 0 stars for our experience with the Dragon. TBD about the Dog."
4,Works Fine,"The Crane Dragon works fine for us. No problems so far. My only complaint is that this thing looks like a Dinosaur or a Lizard, not a Dragon. A Dragon has wings and whatnot while this thing is armless.Keep in mind that when you buy this thing if you intend to run it during the night, you will need to refill it once per day. Not a big deal for us but keep that in mind."
3,pig humidifier,This is an awesome machine. It works beautifully.It came in a broken box with part of the base broken off. I can't complain as it was 20 dollars less than retail. It would've been nice to know it was damaged. Won't be buying anything else on AMazon anytime soon.
1,BREAKS EASILY,"I received this item from my baby registry a few months ago. After using it for only a few weeks, the fan became so loud that I couldn't use it anymore when sleeping. Because it was a gift, I did not have a receipt and Crane would not provide a free replacement as part of their warranty.BEWARE. THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WELL MADE AND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE."
3,water leaks,"It worked well for nearly a month. Several days ago, water leaked from the tank during night. I don'n know what happened with the valve for it looked no disorder. As I need it every day, I will return it and buy a new one. Hope the new one would be well."
5,Easy to clean and works great!,I just went through 4 different humidifiers from 3 different stores. The first one was at target and it was the Vicks warm mist humidifier..SO tedious to maintain and started leaking after 3 nights. Returned it and went to Bed Bath and Beyond and bought a holmes cool air purifier. After 2 nights it stopped working and was also difficult to clean. Then went to lowes and tried one there. Same problem! it must have been a run of bad luck! I had seen this humidifier initally at target but had never heard of Crane so didnt think anything of it. SO GLAD I CAME ON HERE AND RESEARCHED! should have done that in the first place! it is SO easy to keep up and the videos showing how to do it on here are perfect!! plus its been a week and it has not broken! totally happy finally! thank you for making a good product!
3,Good one,"I already have one this - cow shape, I like it very much.The Frog shape is my second one, I think the holes are a little bit bigger, the steam can't get high as my first one. And the frog head is not tight on the water tank.I recommend the cow shape."
2,Check unit within warranty period,"We've had two of these- the first worked very well, but over time (even with regular cleaning) the plastic can stain and the construction makes cleaning a bit of work. So we bought a new one after running the first for a couple years. The second unit, unfortunately, had a problem where the filters would not thread properly to the bottom of the frog's head (where you fill it with water). After the 4th filter I decided to email and call the company. After no response, I called back a few more times and finally spoke with customer service who promptly sent a warranty form only after mentioning a few times that the filters ""are not required"" for operation. My guess is that this was a stock response to a known issue.I'll follow up with another review after the support request is fulfilled. My advice is to be sure to check the humidifier fully before using more than once."
2,They Don't Last!,"I own the Frog and the Elephant. After one year, the Frog wouldn't output any moisture unless it was turned to full blast. I checked to make sure that the fan wasn't blocked, and it wasn't. It just quit working. After just a matter of months the Elephant quit working all together. It only made a grinding noise when turned on. I am extremely dissapointed with this product and DO NOT recommend it!"
2,Works great-until it quits!,I bought this Crane Adorable Leopard Cool Mist Humidifier. It worked great. Loved it. So did my cats. After using it for 1 winter approximately 4 months it stopped working. I had cleaned it and put it away in it's original box after it was dry. The following winter I set it up and it worked for a few weeks and quit. I origingally would give it a 5 star but I expected it to last more than a few months. I was past the warrenty so Throw it away! I also have a second Crane teardrop humidifier. It also stopped working. Crane must make these to last 1 year. Oh well....
2,Annoying to fill up,"We have used this humidifier in our baby's room for a couple of months now, and while it works well, it is the biggest pain to refill. When you remove the head from the base, water leaks everywhere. It doesn't matter if you keep it upright or turn it upside down, I end up getting water all over the place. We are currently looking at other humidifiers to replace this one."
4,Super quiet humidifier,"After suffering for 2 winters with my daughter's super loud Graco humidifier, I finally broke down and bought her a new one. After reading Consumer Reports, I chose Crane. It arrived today and we are immediately pleased with it. It is so quiet my husband didn't even know it was on when he went into her room to read her bedtime stories. Her old one was so loud that she refused to go to bed with it on and I would sneak into her room to turn it on after she was asleep. This one gives out a good amount of cool mist which is adjustable, is super quiet and has an auto shut off and is super cute - all for a reasonable price! I also have two Vicks humidifiers (purchased over the years from Walmart) and both cost the same, are much louder and don't have an auto shut off - so this is far better value for the money. I am going to replace them with Cranes!"
2,Problems after 2 years,"This has been a great humidifier -- cute, quiet, does its job. However, after two years of occasional use, it has started making a very loud noise when turned on, to the point we can no longer use it. At first, the noise was infrequent. Now it is constant. Disappointing given the price. Expected it to last longer."
2,We liked it until it died,"We thought this was a pretty good product until it stopped working after only 3 months of use. It put out a decent amount of humidity, but was fairly difficult to clean. Then after about two months it started to make a louder (mechanical) buzzing sound during use, later it would only buzz loudly and stopped turning on at all.It's cute, but I would pay more for a product that was less likely to break."
5,"One complaint, but was warned","I love this product. It's easy to use, fill and maintain. My only complaint is the white film that was mentioned if you may have hard water. So I would suggest the filter even if you don't think you have hard water!"
2,broke after 2 weeks,"Have had this just a few weeks and it's already not working. I thought - no way - when I read all of the bad reviews on it, and it seems they are right. I have kept it clean and there is plenty of space around and under the unit. There is no reason for the motor to have stopped working other than it being a piece of junk.When it worked, it worked great. I'm very disappointed and probably will never purchase another Crane product again."
2,"cute frog, but water everywhere on the table it is sitting on","I brought the elephant and like it - quite and work well. So we decide to get the frog because it is cute. However, the water mist is coming out of the top of the frog and even if we turned it up so the mist is over the head as recommended, the table ended up wet in the morning. There was a year apart between purchase, we definitely see improvement in design though. There are 2 lights - one red and one green to indicate on and off. The ultrasound things in the tank is covered unlike the old one that was exposed. The top head is not secure like the old one just you can just take it out easily or is that bad now the little one and take it off and misplace it anywhere? The plastic seems thinner than before. The bottom has more plastic cover and seems more secure than before. I will get the elephant again because that seems to aim the mist in the right direction instead of over the head."
2,Had Spongebob one for 1.5 years and it broke!,"I am NOT happy right now as I type this. We bought the Spongebob humidifier in December 2008. We don't use it too often, maybe 4 times a year when the kids get sick. My daughter just developed a cold, which sounds like it may turn into a ""croupy"" cough, so I got it out...filled it....plugged it in...and *poof* it just blew out. The light was on for a split second, then DONE. R.I.P. Spongebob. (and yes, I tried other outlets. It's definitely the motor on the machine.) I'm so mad, because I remember growing up, having the same humidifier my entire childhood. Just 1.5 years? Buyer beware.But when it was working, it worked very well. It's quiet and let out three different levels of cool mist. I'm tempted to buy another one, because I liked it so much, but I'm afraid to waste my money."
4,Product is good; customer service is great,"I originally received a defective unit as a gift. Despite not having a receipt, Crane was very reasonable and sent a replacement right away without any hassle!Otherwise, the unit operates quietly and puts out a good amount of vapor. The water vapor is baffled, so it does not shoot directly out and wet nearby furniture and curtains. The tank is large enough for the unit to run for several hours. It automatically shuts off when the water level is low, and thus it can run largely unattended."
4,Cowabunga,"My daughter loves the cow and so do I. So far its been really reliable. But like most humidifiers, I simply don't enjoy having to clean the device daily - meaning both the base with water and then the tank itself. Other humidifiers require the same maintenance plan so don't let that dissuade you from choosing this particular humidifier. I didn't like the frog model; individual mileage may vary from animal to animal."
5,Why thank you Mr. Squarepants!,Great humidifier for the price. No filters is awesome. I love the design. I love everything about this humidifier! I've had no problems with it all. It has worked well and puts out a really good amount of mist on 2.
3,Good but,"It's a good product but the problem, ironically, is that the cute penguin head impairs the mist from spraying out. If you remove the head, you'll see how profuse the production of the mist is. Once you place the head back on, there's just a lot of condensation and the water droplets just fall back into the dispenser. If the mouth/spout were a little wider, I think this would be a good product."
2,Maintenance is a pain,"The manufacturer recommends emptying the humidifier daily. While there is a removable water tank on top, there is also an area in the base that fills with water. This means that in order to empty the humidifier I need to remove the tank, dump that, then unplug the humidifier base and drag that to the bathroom sink and dump that as well (invariably getting the cord wet in the process).I don't know if this design is common to all humidifiers, but I don't understand the value in a removable tank if you need to move the whole unit for proper daily maintenance.Other than that, seems to be working ok. Haven't noticed a change in the humidity but I've been keeping the setting rather low."
1,Complete Waste of Money,The humidifier stopped working after 2 months!! The service center is total waste..you have to ship the product to service center on your cost (which is half the cost of Humidifier!!) for any repairs.Complete waste of money...buy at your own risk.
3,it's cute but not the best humidifier,"It's really cute but it's not the most functional humidifier. It's sort of loud which I don't mind because it serves as white noise for my newborn baby girl. But the cool mist comes out of thin slits at the tops of both ears and not much mist comes out compared to my other humidifier.Crane 2.3 Gallon COOL Mist humidifier, White and Blue"
5,Great design and very effective!,"This humidifier was absolutely essential while I was pregnant, as I couldn't take any medications for colds at the time. My daughter is now 7 months and just got her first cold, and the humidifier helped to reduce her symptoms, too. The design is great: The output is completely adjustable and even on the highest setting, a full tank lasts through the night. And it really is cute!"
1,hwalan lee,"Hello, I bought it about 3 month ago. I checked the machin is okay as soon as it delivered. It was definitely okay at the first time. I had another humidifier, and I was waiting for the filter, and I used it las weekend, it was not worked at all. The mist was not worked and I am really sorry about it. It delivered about 3 month ago, so I don't think I can not get a replace for it. What should I do.."
4,Great one,"I purchased the Crane humidifier a few months back and got about 20 uses out of it before it cracked and broke. I filled it up with water and as I was turning it over to twist the top back on it the handle snapped off, then the the whole thing just fell and cracked. I will purchase another one since this is a great product that really helped with my breathing. FYI: fill it up only half way."
1,Dangerous Cord Attachment Failure in Hello Kitty model,"We bought both the Hello Kitty and Penguin style ""Adorable"" Crane humidifier. The penguin had issues getting water fed through the demineralization filter (once it was thoroughly saturated, this issue resolved). The Hello Kitty model had a far more serious issue.After a week of use, my husband noticed that the cord attachment at the back had completely cracked through, exposing bare wires. (I uploaded pictures on the product page). The attachment is very stiff.The penguin model has a much better attachment - it is sturdier, and has more flexibility. I'm sending back the kitty and keeping the penguin, for now."
1,Worst!,After only 3 weeks of use the unit started leaking all over the place. I can't even return it now so I am stuck - beware!
2,Started leaking,"I used this product for about a month and it seamed to work fine. It's not completely quiet because you'll hear the gurgle of water every now and then, especially if it's turned up high. Overall, I was happy, until I woke up one morning and saw a huge pool of water where the humidifier had been. I have hard wood floors, so my floors had some water damage. Just to make sure it wasn't a fluke, I used it the next few days with a bucket underneath it to catch water, and sure enough...it continued to leak. I called Amazon and they shipped out a new one. I haven't really used to the new one yet, so I'm not sure if the same thing will happen. I have a feeling it will. This item is cute, but cheaply made."
4,Been in constant use since November - A+,"I've burned through a few humidifiers in my time, and this one is lasting really well. The directional spout is great, and I've cleaned the unit twice with a bit of listerine dilution in warm water just to be safe during the cold/flu season. It's easy to fill and the mist selection is very sensitive - I use it full blast during the day when some windows are open and low at night when we're closed in.One thing to be careful of - have clean hands when you fill it, because the bottom face can become contaminated and then you'll have to clean the base out.Cute and well designed, and durable!"
3,Not very effective,"Pros:-Very affordable-Cute. Kids love it-No filter needed-Quiet (but you will hear occasional bubbling sounds)Cons:-This kind of humidifier really is not very effective. Particularly if you have a large room. A lot of people have actually measured the difference in the humidity and you are lucky if you be able to bump up the humidity by 3%.-This is cold mist and cold mist tend to go down to the floor. If you turn the setting high, you will notice your floor or carpet in the vicinity is wet. Place it close to your heater vent so the air from your hvac will help circulate the mist better. Unlike vaporizer which is a form of steam, steam tend to go up and circulate much better. The problem with vaporizer is they produce very little steam.-Whenever you refill water, it always leak. The way you replace water is by lifting the head."
2,poor circulation,"I used kitty humififier in my bedroom last winter, but it didn't help a lot, in terms of enhancing indoor humidity. Mists only surrounded by the humififier. I'm very disappointed and consider to buy another steam humififier. Because my roomate's steam humififier worked very well. Vapor circulated smoothly and quickly and really kept indoor humidity."
3,Pretty Cute,This unit is adorable and thrilled my daughter. The whole unit glows a purple-pink color at night (not too bright). It started making weird noises on start up after about 3-4 months. I would not count on this lasting for more than 6-12 months if you use it every night.
1,Two broken fan motors in 9 months,"We bought two Crane Adorable (penguin and elephant) for our newborn. Both were working great for 6 months. Then the first unit fan motor stopped working and fog can no longer blow up and out of the unit. Then the second unit fan motor started making loud churning noises, and eventually stopped working as well. I wrote to Crane customer service, and now have to deal with the hassle of mailing in a cut cord from each unit to get a replacement, and while doubtful of the quality of replacement units. If the fan motors break 2 for 2, who's to say they won't break again?"
1,noisy in 2 years,broken in 2 years with rarely usage. very noisy from the fan. something was broken inside. a lot of white dust at the entry of vent. The other one has no problem. I think the duck one has quality issues from manufacture.
2,Cute but stopped working!,This was very cute in my baby boy's room and it worked well for three days... then it just stopped working! We returned it.
2,ok for small room,"It is adorable, quiet and works sufficiently, but only for a small room. The output on this humidifier did not make a difference in my son's room and his is medium size room. If you have just a small space though, I'd strongly recommend it."
2,Mostly a piece of junk,"I got it and it worked great for a few months. Then it started making this awful loud noise when turned on, at first I could get it to go off- but now there's not a whole lot I can do. It's a really cute humidifier and worked great for a little bit, but now it has to go in the trash. A shame."
1,everything beneath is soaking wet,"We bought this humidifier in the frog and the elephant. The problem with the frog is that all of the mist settles on the humidifier and below it and everything ends up soaking wet. We elevated it, as was suggested in the directions, and it ended up in a pool of water. This can't be good for the cord. My husband drilled holes near the eyes to make the mist shoot away from the humidifier and this helped. Then we plugged the original holes with packing tape and it functioned better. It just shouldn't be this difficult.Buy the elephant, not the frog. The elephant forces the mist away from the humidifier and into the air."
1,Humidifier was Used,"My son liked the cute Dragon Humidifier. We were disgusted when we opened the package to find that the humidifier had been USED. I am annoyed that Amazon sent me someone's return and did not bother to check it before sending it to me. (Amazon does sell Used items, why did I have to pay full price for this mess?) There were scratches in the water basin and a greasy fingerprint. Very unsanitary. Amazon needs to clean up it act!"
2,Worked good for only 3 months!,"I bought this in October 2010 to put in the master bedroom for me & my infant daughter. It worked great until a couple days ago. I turned it on & the motor was making the worst sound ever! It still produced steam but nobody could have slept with the noise it made. My husband & I poured out all the water & checked the whole unit out. We thought we had fixed the problem, one little part got clogged, but when I turned it on at bedtime, it started making the noise again. I intend to contact the manufacturer & see if I can get a replacement. If not then I have to buy another one & it will definitely not be this brand."
1,Cheap plastic junk,"The humidifier arrived with a piece of plastic rattling around in the base. Did not feel safe to add water as the housing was exposed where the plastic fell out.Amazon did an instant refund no questions asked, seems like there have been a lot of complaints with these humidifiers.What is more important? Cuteness or safety? I bought a real pediatric humidifier from the drugstore instead."
1,Does nothing but cause problems,"Those reviewers who say this product does nothing to increase humidity, totally correct listen to them. Those who say it creates some sort of white dust, they are not lying. I'm not even sure how this thing penetrates but i had a DVD in my dvd player and a game in my xbox, and both were not working, I took them out and they were covered in this weird substance. Then a few days later my cable modem broke. This thing wasn't even all that close to my electronics and it ruined them. Do not buy this piece of junk unless you just want to look at it, as it's kind of cute."
4,I love it but... cleaning is a pain,"I have been using this consistently in my baby's room for over 1 year and it still works great. we use it nightly. the air gets really dry in our room and our baby had eczema so we keep it on every night. for those times he had a cold, we cranked it up a notch. HERE IS THE PROBLEM... it is very hard to clean. I clean it once a week. They say that after every use is recommended but I just don't have time for that. I also don't see the point of it. I suggest getting theMini Brush Combo Pack (Sippy Cup Straw and Spout/Lid Cleaning Brush). I bought a set of their brushes for my baby's sippy cups and found it useful for the crane cool mist too. BTW... i have the frog... very cute."
4,Crane Mis Humidifier,"This is a pretty good humidifier. Works well -- except that, sometimes, water drips down the front of it (from under the elephant nose spout). Don't know why that happens cause I don't ever overfill.Aside from the dripping once in a while - I like it and am satisfied with my purchase."
3,It is a very quite humidifier,"This humidifier works quitely in the bedroom. The output of cool mist is adjustable. It has to be placed at least 25 inch high above ground. Water tank needs to be refilled almost every day. Also don't forget to sanitize it at least once a week, this is annoying. Or you may run into a risk of breathing air with a lot of allerge triggling substance, such as mold. For the price you are paying, it is fair enough to say that it is worthy of a consideration."
5,Very quiet and effective!,"Love this thing! Got it for my twins' nursery. Very quiet in comparison with other cool-mist humidifiers I've had in the past. And very adorable! The mist comes out of the top of the eyes. :D I also bought one of those Deminiralizers to make sure we don't have minirals residue all over, but have read that I have to replace them monthly ($7 - not too bad). The only thing is when you run it on max it makes everything around it damp. So I typically don't ever run it on max."
5,Functional and adorable!,This is the best humidifier I've ever used. I've used more expensive 1s with and without filters and this is by far the easiest to use/clean. Plus my toddler LOVES it. We have 2. The nightlight is awesome.
1,Furniture destroyer,"I agree very cute, but something must have been wrong with the one i purchased. It worked great for about two weeks, then I woke up one morning to find the dresser top covered with water. So for the 30 or so dollars I saved I got to replace a dresser for 750."
4,Good,"Does well what is it meant to do. Not too noisy, but has a bright green light,so make sure your little one can sleep if not totally dark."
2,"Works great, but not for long","I was very happy with it, until it started making awful buzzing noice, customer service did not help in any way. So if you want to buy a new humidifier every year, buy this one"
4,"Effective, very adorable","Works well. Almost silent, so you can easily have it on in a bedroom. It can be a bit of a hassle to clean (more like you need to plan time to clean it) and the plastic feet are a little cheap (one of them has cracked, but it doesn't affect the function), but for the price, it's not bad. Very cute."
3,Good while still working,"We loved this humidifier when we first received it. It's been almost a year (but not quite) and it recently started making this horrible noise and stopped working. I like my other Crane humidifier better (drop shape)... it's more quiet, easier to clean, and is still working. This one is definitely cuter but at this point I'd rather have functionality!"
2,"Works fine, but big pain overall","This humidifier works great and has a soothing, river-like sound. But I don't recommend it. The bottom part collects water overnight, so instead of just toting the main chamber to the bathroom, you have to unplug it and schlep the entire thing to dump out both parts. Then, because of the design of the main chamber, you can never get all of the water out of it, so you can never get it to fully dry out. I wish we had bought a conventional humidifier for our son - he wouldn't have known any different."
4,"Works great, looks great!","I purchased this humidifier after my wife pestered me about how dry it was in our bedroom during the winter. This humidifier is extremely quiet, has solved her dry air problem, and is clearly the best looking humidifier on the market. This is a great humidifier for the price, and I would recommend it for anyone looking to improve the dryness of a bedroom or another room of equivalent size.Unfortunately, our first penguin had a fan issue after about 2 weeks (it got really loud). I emailed Crane customer service and they quickly responded, telling me to return the humidifier for a new one. Once I submitted return on Amazon, we received a new one in about 1.5 days. It has now been a few more weeks and our new humidifier is going strong. Great customer service."
4,"Cool Design, Keeps you cool","Nice humidifier, keeps the room cool and humid.on the flip side, it gives some noise while running, but manageble"
4,Very good,"although it stopped working for a while, but it is ok now after I turn it to other side to let the water down. It worked excellent right now. The shape is cute and my baby love it. My family never feel dry throat since I begin using it."
2,Disappointed by Penguin humidifier,"My husband and I purchased the penguin humidifier several months ago after moving to Scottsdale. We initially used the humidifier without any problems. Then, we put the penguin away for the summer. When we took it out again last night, it wouldn't work at all. We checked the user's manual, and it appears that we are doing everything correctly. I guess we're out of luck! I should have trusted the large number of negative reviews and chosen a more reliable product. While the humidifier is really cute, I wouldn't recommend it based on its sketchy reliability. It was a waste of money."
5,works for me,"It's very quiet. I put it on my nightstand next to my bed. Did not bother me a bit. I've been using it almost every night since I got it and it's still working fine. It looks very cute too.The only thing is that when you refill the water tank, it could become a little heavy. But you don't really need to completely fill it up. Even just half or 1/3 full, it can last quite a few days already. Just like some other users recommended, I cleaned it by putting some vinegar in and shook it vigorously for a while."
3,"Cute, but not as functional as the standard teardrop Crane","We are a Crane ultrasonic humidifier family - have them in everyone's bedrooms, and they run for most of the year. I bought this one to replace the old Crane that was in our nursery when it finally gave out. I thought the elephant design was really cute and would look great in our jungle-themed room. The problem is that, unless you leave it on the lowest setting, the condensation collects under the elephant lid and leaks all over the surface it sits on. So, we use it without the elephant lid, and now it just looks weird.Anyway, definitely buy a Crane...just go with one of the colorful teardrop shapes. They're awesome!"
1,Craptacular Humidifier,"Just bought this Crane penguin humidifier, filled it with filtered Brita filter, and it didn't work!!! It's going to be returned tomorrow morning. I am so jealous of the reviewers who had working humidifiers on this page."
1,bad quality,It had a crack on the base of the humidifier only two days after I got the product. Now it doesn't work after two months.
1,Don't buy this product!,"We bought the Frog cuz we thought it looked cute...just like everyone else. This humidifier was designed so poorly (and cheap) that you can expect water everywhere, everytime you touch it. Not my kind of fun. This CRANE frog humidifier should be sold at the Dollar Store for $5.00 I still wouldn't buy it, but at least you're only paying for it's true value!"
3,"It's still alive, barely",A day after pulling it out of the box the light stopped working. The paint job on the dials smeared off and now it makes a dreadfull humming sound when you turn it on. I feel like any day now it will just stop working. Didn't even last a year but my daughter loves the darn thing. It is very cute.
2,Crane Elephant humidifier leaks,"Condensation accumulates in the top of the elephants trunk and dribbles down the front of the unit. The last two nights it has soaked a hand towel to the point that I had to wring it out in the morning. Before that, it would leave a puddle of water on my dresser.Produces a very good amount of humidity and is relatively quiet.Don't recommend this model, the elephant."
5,Works like a charm,Bought this a couple of months ago to help on those nights when my son is sick. So far after several months I haven't had any problems with the unit. Its great that they have so many different choices of animal designs to compliment your child's room. Probably the only quirk with this unit that I can find is that there is a handle on the top of the water tank but it says not to carry the water tank with the handle when the tank is full. So what is the point of having the handle on the tank?
3,"Vapor great, but design means it goes slightly up then pools around the base.","Unless I have the fan on, the vapor just goes up some and then pools around the base of the vaporizer. I love the look but wish it would disperse better."
4,Works great and cute.,Works great. Our daughter kept having this dry cough during the night. We got this for her room and it help dramatically. The only thing I would say is that it is a little awkward to refill because of the shape. My husband actually dropped it in the tub while he was refilling it and it completely busted so had to order a new one. So be careful when filling.
1,Product failed on first use,"Despite the wide range of reviews, I took a chance on the Penguin model for my son's room. The humidifier repeatedly failed on the first day. It ran for 5-10 minutes and shut off. The 'tank empty' red light came on. After checking the valve and resetting the water tank, the unit worked ran for another 5-10 minutes and then shut off. After four or five additional attempts to get the humidifier working, I came to the conclusion that I'd received a faulty unit. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy for defective products."
1,Poorly made,"It does not work until it has been on and plugged in for over a minute, and then it is still intermittent. I called the manufacturer and they were no help. I would spend your money on one that is boring looking but will actually work for your sick kids when you need it. Absolute waste of money."
1,Didn't last work out of the box,"The first date of use, the humidity leaked water from the bottom of the unit and flooded my carpet, the second day the Hello Misss Kitty humidifier burnt up."
1,Terrible item. The spongbob model,I bought 2 of them. Both are very very loud noise. I can't even sleep.And I exchange both of them. Still got 2 very very loud noise items.Total will be 4 breakdown items.The spongebob model is very bad quality.
4,Cool Mist Humidifier,"The product is very easy to use and works fantastic, we also have the frog. Originally purchased for my daughters fancy rat who at the time was suffering from respiratory illness. However, with continuous use I have had to place a towel under the product because of condensation build up and to absorb moisture. I thought maybe it was just my particular unit but, I have spoken to several other people who have had the same response. My conclusion is the setting was placed to high for too long. Hope this helps :)"
5,Good Gift,I gifted it to a friends who's expecting. They love how cute it looks. Goes with the theme for a baby's room.
3,Cute but not long lasting,"Inspite of the low overall rating I bought it because it was too cute to pass. I'm not disappointed I bought it but I'm not completely satisfied either. Super cute and works well for one winter. After 5 months of everyday use the motor started making noise. Because it was under warranty got the base replaced but didn't get to use it much that year. Now this is the second winter, started using the unit with the new base. Worked fine for a couple months, heard slight noise from the motor one night for a few min and it corrected itself after a while. It has been working fine so far but I'm apprehensive."
4,must-have for baby,"This humidifier is extremely easy to use and very reliable. The only thing is, like a lot of humidifiers, it requires weekly cleaning with water/vinegar."
1,Noisy,"This humidifier was great while it lasted....It was nice and quiet, did it's job, and was very cute. However, after only 2 weeks, it suddenly started sounding like a motor boat whenever you turn it on. There's no way to sleep with it on. Even my husband who is by no means a light sleeper and sleeps through anything can't sleep with it on. It's totally useless. I should've gotten a cheap $20 humidifier...Even those tend to last longer than 2 weeks."
1,Broke after a Month,"Worked great while it lasted.. Unfortunately it only lasted a month.E-mailed Crane asking for a replacement, but unfortunately I bought this in-store and didn't keep my receipt.. My loss, I guess - I will never buy Crane again."
4,Good little humidifier,"Desperately needed a humidifier for my new condo. Saw the picture and knew my girlfriend would love the cute looking penguin. It works extremely well. Does make a slight gurgling noise on high, I am a heavy sleeper and enjoy the white noise. Needs to be refilled every 8 hours and placed on a high, about 2 foot, surface. Can't beat it for the price. Although meant for a child's room, it fits our decor. And yes my girlfriend also found it to be quite adorable, as the name implies."
1,Not as good as other humidifiers,"I bought this for my four-year-old Hello Kitty fan. She had another Crane humidifier when she was smaller (elephant) that worked well and still works for her little sister. This is not nearly the same quality. After a couple of months it died. No steam, just a lovely melted plastic smell. While this may be good if you are trying to finish off your family, it will not help finish off a head cold. I think the little night light in it may be part of a design flaw.I would recommend the elephant, and will be heading out to Target to get one this week."
2,A leaky mess,"I bought this product because I thought it was really cute, and the reviews seemed to be positive overall. However, my experience was not good. I followed all the instructions to a T and it worked nicely for about 3 days, then shortly afterward started malfunctioning. Every time I filled it up and turned it on water would flood out, and mist wouldn't come out. The only way I could get the mist to start coming out and the water to not leak out was to barely fill the tank and then fiddle around and move the top part so it was tilted to the side, which allowed the mist to flow out. I'm sorry to say I think this product is an example of something that pulls you in with its looks but fails to deliver on performance."
1,Bought Two; They Both Broke,"I totally agree with the negative reviews on here. I HATE the fact that I bought not one but TWO of these stupid humdifiers. Both of them broke right after the 3 month warranty period (from Target). I blew $80 in one year on the frog and the elephant; neither of which work anymore, and because I threw away the receipts after 3 months, I can not get a refund. GRRRRRRRRRRR.The first one I bought started to leak around the gasket around month 4 of ownership, and by leak, I mean the water went everywhere. It ruined the wooden nightstand it was on in my baby's bedroom. The second humidifier (I should have learned my lesson after the first one, but oh no, not me) worked fine for a while, then I boxed it up for a couple of months. When I took it out again last week to use, it didn't work at all. Not even a small puff of steam. Nothin'."
2,got 2 defective units,"the first one is inoperative out of the box, exchanged 2nd unit works intermittently.The steam emitted from the top, so there is not much moisture spreading the room . Not a good model compare to Penguin which I purchase before the SpongeBobNot recommended .However, Amazon did a good job in exchange, just a day after I filed exchanged on line, I got 2nd unit arrive at my door. But sadly, the second one did not work either"
1,Piece of junk,"This worked well for a month, but now it's headed for the garbage. The glue holding a rubber gasket on back dissolved and water leaks everywhere. I didn't expect much for $30, but I did expect more than 30 days of use."
1,Broke after 2 uses,"Used this frog humidifier 2 nights, turning it off during the day, and by night 3 it no longer worked. Had it continued to work, it would have been a great unit, my kids thought it was cute, it pushed the vapor up into the air, was easy to fill, etc. I was really disappointed when it quit working. If you do decide to buy this unit, make sure it can be returned without too much trouble - just in case."
1,CRANE Thomas the Tank needs to goto SODOR for repair!!!!,"As with the last reviewer, that clear little plastic piece designed to light up the tank fell into the tank after the third time we filled it. Then water leaked everywhere, including onto the electronics. Apparently the plastic is simply glued into the tank and with even the slightest touch it falls back inside. When you place the tank back onto Thomas this piece fits over the other clear plastic piece that houses the actual bulb light. This apparently is enough to cause the piece to loosen and fall into the tank. There is no way to fix this or any warning NOT to touch it. In the course of normal filling its almost guaranteed you will touch this at some time. I dont know about you, but mixing toddlers, water and electricity is a recipe for DISASTER!!CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED ANYWHERE NEAR THIS PRODUCT!! THIS IS A MAJOR DEFECT AND SAFETY HAZARD!!!! THE PRODUCT SHOULD BE RECALLED!!!"
4,Excellent Humidifier with one catch,"I have purchased several of Crane's humidifiers and have thrown several of them away: the crane, two apples. I have 2 elephants and wouldn't buy any of the other models. The elephants put out the maximum amount of humidity with the least amount of problems. The only problem I have had is they leak under the snout to a small extent.They are easy to clean and we run them 24 hours a day when we are home. I would recommend them, but realize that there is some leaking and you need to put a towel in front of them. I would buy additional elephants if needed."
1,Not happy with item,"I'm surprised these are getting such good reviews. I ordered one, the base came cracked, amazon quickly replaced it and then the other one I ordered (the pig) doesn't turn on at all. I've just decided to return both and stop having to deal with this product. Amazon does a great job with replacing/refunding their product but they might want to consider not carrying this product."
3,Not very effective,"Bought 1 1/2 year agoPros:-Very affordable-Cute. Kids love it-No filter needed-Quiet (but you will hear occasional bubbling sounds)Cons:-This kind of humidifier really is not very effective. Particularly if you have a large room. A lot of people have actually measured the difference in the humidity and you are lucky if you be able to bump up the humidity by 3%.-This is cold mist and cold mist tend to go down to the floor. If you turn the setting high, you will notice your floor or carpet in the vicinity is wet. Place it close to your heater vent so the air from your hvac will help circulate the mist better. Unlike vaporizer which is a form of steam, steam tend to go up and circulate much better. The problem with vaporizer is they produce very little steam.-Whenever you refill water, it always leak. The way you replace water is by lifting the head of the frog."
5,Great Product,My daughter was always coughing at night and we cant do anything about it until I purchased this item. This really works. My daughter can sleep now all night long.
4,Great humidifier for small rooms and for little kids,"This is a great humidifier for small rooms and for the little kids. It is a cute showing details of the the feet, mouth, and nose of the frog. It spits out mist just at the top of its eyes like it got angry (similar to what you see with cartoons characters when they are mad and steam coming out of their heads). But on the contrary, the frog is forever smiling.The knob just below the face of the frog controls how powerful the mist comes out. When you put it at high, the water will be gone in two days. But if you put it in low, it can last the whole week. Make sure to clean it every time you fill up to prevent build-up of residues."
1,"Worthless, worked once and never again!","I only had the chance to use this item once, when I received. I bought it ahead of time for a child and when I finally got around to using it, it never worked. I have another friend who bought the penguin and had the same problem. It only worked the same day she bought it. Luckily she was able to take it to a store where she had to exchange 3 times before she gave up. You don't even have the benefit of exchanging on this product. Save your money and don't go with the cutesy humidifier, you are better off just getting one that actually works."
1,"okay, until burned a hole and melted plastic","I have this in my children's room. It had worked probably 20 times, until it just burned a hole in the plastic and melted two parts of the humidifier. It is thrown away, and I will be contacting the company."
2,Didn't work :(,"I received the dragon shaped humidifier as a baby shower gift and was very excited to use it because it was so cute. Unfortunately it did not work, for some reason the water would not drain down into the basin properly unless you wiggled the whole container, then once it had used all the water that was in the base you had to wiggle it again to get more water to go down. So unless I wanted to stand in my daughters room all night wiggling the humidifier it wasn't going to work for us. I think maybe the one we had was just defective or something but Amazon was wonderful and let us return it, even though it was a gift (it was on our baby registry) and gave us a gift card to purchase something else. I don't think I'll be getting this exact one again because I don't know if we'll have the same problem. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 for the cuteness factor but otherwise it did us no good."
1,"One worked for 6 weeks, another one for 2.","I bought this product after seeing its high rating in Consumer Reports. It worked fine for while, though the output was only half of what is advertised: 1 gallon in 24 hours, instead of 2. I even bought a second one, for the office. This second one stopped working in 2 weeks: more precisely, the fan stopped. The first one stopped working now, after less than 6 weeks."
3,"Worked great, but two units have broken in under a year","I have owned both the penguin and the elephant humidifiers in the past year. Both worked great -- quiet, lots of mist, basically what everyone else has said -- but both developed leaks within six months of occasional use. Water draining out of the base where the power cord enters the unit does not instill confidence in a product. Each unit was only lightly used, too; they would run at night whenever our child had a cold. After the penguin broke I bought the elephant, thinking it was a freak occurrence, but then that one broke too. We treated them very carefully, drained the water each day (well, usually) and periodically cleaned it with a diluted vinegar solution like the instructions recommend. I think we're through with Crane products... tonight I bought the Safety 1st humidifier so we'll see how that goes."
2,Sometimes Crane humidifers are hit or miss,"This is the 4th Crane humidifier I've purchased. The first, a frog, stopped producing mist a few months after purchase (seems to be a common problem with the frog based upon other reviews). The second and third, an elephant and dragon, are still going strong after 3 and 2.5 years, respectively. The fourth, which is the Hello Kitty, started to have problems after a few months. The motor started making a very loud noice, the base became very hot and the mist slowed considerably. Crane's response has been fantastic. They are going to replace. Will send an update when the replacement arrives and has had some use."
3,Cute but leaky,"I bought this for my baby son's room and it is adorable. It is so leaky, however, that figuring out where to put it is tricky. Since it blows stream straight up, it would make sense to put it on the floor, but you would ruin your flooring by doing so. I had to put it under a towel on a small wooden side table that I don't care about destroying. I like that it produces plenty of steam for a small room and it can run for 24 hours without a refill. Overall, I'd say I'm moderately satisfied with it."
2,"Cute, but not practical","We bought this humidifier for our nursery because it had many good reviews, but after reading the instruction packet, we decided to take it back without even using it. The reason: it is not supposed to be put on anything that could be damaged by water (wood, metal, etc.) and cannot be placed on a towel because the fan is on the bottom. That pretty much leaves plastic furniture, which we have, but another instruction is that it should be kept out of the child's reach (reasonable enough), but plastic furniture could never be stable enough to repel an adventurous child trying to reach the very cute humidifier. We want something that will be usable as our child grows and learns to walk, but this obviously will not work for us.On another note for those still considering buying it, while it says ""1 gallon"" in the title of this product, the box says 2.1 gallons."
3,Mother of Twins,"I bought this for my sons room. It's an ok humidifier, the frog is much easier to fill and had two openings rather than one. We've moved this one to our room for occasional use and the Frog version is our full time one. The shape of the penguin is difficult to fill in standard sinks but the frog is shorter and more round. If you are noise sensitive though you may want to consider a different model. This does make trickling noises when it's on."
2,Lasted a while then died.,When I was trying to find a humidifier for my son I looked at all the reviews. I had some reservations due to some poor comments regarding this humidifier. I decided to go ahead with it because I've heard Amazon has a really good customer service department.I've had this item for over a month now and it works perfectly. It arrived at my door in a timely manner as promised and was packaged well.*Update*So this humidifier worked for a few months then died out. Of course with this type of humidifier you are also going to get all that white residue over everything.
1,"Very messy, hard to clean.","The shape of the tank made it very difficult to pour in water or clean. Also, if the top cover is not perfectly closed, the collected water drips from the gap. This made a big mess in our bedroom.You need to clean both the tank and the base of this humidifier everyday because the water collects in the base as well, and it is easy to have the mold growth on the base.We got rid of this humidifier because it was too difficult to keep it clean and bacteria free. Now that my baby walks about, having this in her room would have been too dangerous anyways."
1,Deceptive Duck = Defective Duck,"..or shall I rather say, Deceptive Duck is worse than Defective Duck? You decide...as for myself, WHEN will I learn to listen to critical educated reviewers instead of opting to grab a ""bargain"" only to learn that YET AGAIN the minority were right and that the reviews of the careless masses just misguide people into needless hassle.The duck ducts emit a deceptive mist.Deceptive how?Because the mist goes nowhere. The room does NOT humidify. After hours on at the highest setting, my body & eyes remain dry as ever. Furthermore, placing it nearby my seat subjects me to an unpleasant odor (electronic or otherwise?) and EMFs.So I remain dehydrated, from forced air heat combined with computer use. Should I take the leap again with a Swiss or Honeywell or Holmes product? Promising or not, once burnt, forever wary."
1,It came to me cracked!!!,"I have one humidifier by Crane and I LOVE it, this one however came to me cracked in the main water holding tank, when we tried to fill it, it leaked everywhere! I was so disappointed as it was a surprise for my children and now I have to send it back and see if I can find a new one somewhere. :( I am so not happy!"
4,Best one i've found!,"I tried 2 other humidifiers and this is by far the best one i found! I had a really hard time finding a good one, and unless you spend over $100 you wont find one that got perfect reviews and this by far was the best one. It is quiet and soothing. Because its a cool mist one you dont hear the bubbling of the water or the motor (as the others i tried) It doesnt leak when you move it the wrong way, and its easy to clean. The only thing that i can find wrong (which is most likely because i havent figured out how to use it correctly) is that if the mist is on too high it get everything around it wet because the air isnt sucking up all the moisture. Even though i use it for myself and have no children i would recommend it to adults because its not just a machine sitting on you wardrobe, its actually decorative, which is a plus!"
5,highly recommended!,"highly impressed! not only cute, but there are no water droplets on my floor, furniture or curtains! this is my third humidifier purchase of different brands and proud to say my last-im so happy with this. all that comes out is steam. i bought two different brands prior and they both made a complete wet mess in the area surrounding them. this is very easily filled and very little residue that is easily wiped off when needed. great product! outstanding price!"
4,very good humidifier....,its nice owning one of this... helped a lot with my son.. definitely recommend this to all parents... i hate cleaning it though!
3,1 year lifetime,"I've owned 3 units in the past 2 years.The penguin's resevoir was too shallow and there was consistent leakage.The Pig was just right and it's currently plugging away in my daughter's room.The cow worked just fine, but died six months after we moved to a hard water area.Pluses- cute, light, and easy to clean.Negatives- short life span in hard water areas, have to refill daily, makes dripping noises if set above 50% output."
4,Worked great -- once we got it on a flat surface!,"For starters, yes, this product really does live up to its name -- it is quite adorable. However, we got very frustrated at first, because the humidifier kept running correctly for an hour or two, and then stopping (the red light came on, indicating that it was ""out of water"", when there was clearly still plenty available). We eventually discovered that the dresser that the elephant was sitting on was not flat! As a result, the water inside the elephant was shifted away from the water sensor inside, and so after a couple of hours, the sensor would think there wasn't enough water. We moved him to a different surface (and checked that it was actually flat, with a level) and he has been working wonderfully ever since!"
1,Had two of them - both died in ~3 months,"They have a problem with a fan that circulates the moist air. I had two of them and both died after about 90 days. I was able to solder-in a fan from computer cooling case to fix both units, they run a little loud, but at least it works. You would expect a $40 humidifier to last longer then 3 months."
3,humidifier just ok,The crane humidifier seems just OK. The humidity provided is not enough for the whole bedroom. Most of the vapour flows in downward direction towards floor ! i want to buy 1 more so will look for something where vapour goes up !
4,Twins Enjoy It,I purchase the Elephant for my son and Frog for my daughter. They both enjoy the look of it in their rooms. It is small enough that I can put it on top of their furniture and not have to worry about ruining their expensive dresser. I enjoy the fact that there is no filter to replace. Filling them is extremely easy since it is so small it fits right in the bathroom sink.I did no give it five stars because when you lift the water tank to fill it water drips out of the bottom and if you flip it over out of the top. I just make sure I bring a towel with me when I am filling them so I can easy clean up any spills.I would still recomend any of the two I have.
4,Humidifier for my daughter,"I love how cute this humidifier is! I'm pleased with how it works, but I wouldn't say it is the best humidifier in the world. It's output is decent but the vicks humidifier I had previously had a much better output."
3,It works,I mean the item works but I didn't notice a difference in my baby's stuffiness. So I don't know if that is because it doesn't work very well or because my daughter was really stuffy. It is cute though.
3,nice but noisier than other crane product,"Bought the elephant one from Amazon and compare to the one bought from Bath bed and Beyond (Frog), the one from Amazon is louder/noisiser. Frankly, I found is cheaper in bath bed and beyond. I still keep the elephant one cause it is not worthed to return and get refund. It wil cost me the same. Wish I found it at Bed bath and beyond first before I bought it from Amazon."
5,Works Great & the nighlight is a bonus!,We love our Hello Kitty humidifier. It works great and the night light is an added bonus. I love that its quiet and easy to fill. I like it so much that I am thinking of tossing my sons (he doesnt have this brand ..he has a brand called Reli-on that doesnt seem to work as nice) ..cant decide on the penguin or frog..or ..maybe the Thomas..decisions!
4,"GREAT humidifier, but it requires some regular maintenance (changing water, clean with vinegar solution weekly)","cute looking humidifier comes in different animals. cool mist is great and it can really put out some volume. Holding tank holds plenty of water for overnight. these things are a must if you ever experience the dryness that comes from running your heater in the winter. Humidity helps with dry throat or sinuses or coughing. also just makes the ambient air more comfortable. My only gripe is that these humidifiers require frequent care and cleaning. you need to change the water regularly and clean with vinegar solution weekly to prevent mold. There are warm air humidifiers that heat the mist, killing any spores. But this one is really good and I recommend it."
2,always breaks!,the top / container part has broken on two or three of these. i have stopped using these crane humidifiers!
4,Mostly flawless Product,"So far my little penguin is blowing out the humidity and bringing a smile to my face whenever I look at it. It does the job nicely, it's easy to assemble, to fill and to operate. My only problem is with the manual. Crane puts out several varieties in the shape of different animals and my manual had photos of another version -- not the penguin I had bought. And the parts differ slightly from each, so you have to do a little guessing as to where things go. Things get figured out fairly quickly, mainly because you keep moving the parts around till they click into place. Anyhow, it's all together now, it works okay and so far, it looks like a winner."
3,It is cute!,"I like the Crane Adorable Elephant. My only compliant about this product is, it's awkward to refill. The shape of it drips water all over when I go to refill it. Other than that, it's a great product."
1,BROKE THE FIRST DAY,"I PREVIOUSLY HAD THE FROG IN THIS BRAND AND THOUGHT IT WOULD BE RELIABLE, SINCE IT WAS THE SAME BRAND, TURNED IT ON AND IT FLOODED MY ROOM, LEAKING FROM THE BOTTOM, THEN IT JUST GOT HOT AFTER THAT LIKE IT WAS GOING TO CATCH FIRE."
4,Oh so quiet!,"I really cannot get over how quiet these humidifiers are when they are running. You'd never know it was on, if you didn't see the little stream of mist being sprayed out from the mouth of the penguin. The tank easily lasts overnight.I'd recommend that you put something under it, as the way the mist is collected to blow out of the face, tends to cause a slight seepage of water from the removable head."
2,broke in 1 month,"This product is adorable and worked really well for a little more than one month. My daughter and son loved it and it wasn't too loud to have next to their beds. However, after 6 weeks of 3-4 night a week use, it broke. We followed the directions exactly and are really disappointed."
3,Good Product,Just started using one week ago but we have hard water so I've been getting city water from a neighbor. It seems to work well. Looked on line for the filter for hard water but haven't been successful.
2,Inconsistent,"Needing something to combat the dry heat of my apartment this winter, I ordered this humidifier. I was tired of waking up with red eyes and a desert-dry mouth. I set the unit up on a slightly elevated surface above my bedside and pointed its output towards me. Whether I fill the tank up entirely or not I still usually wake up feeling crappy and dried out despite having the damn penguin powered on full and pointed directly at me. It seems to do its job for the first few hours but then looses steam half way through the night. When I wake, its output seems weak and insufficient despite it still having water in its reservoir. I have no other experience with humidifiers so I do not know if it is standard for them to function crappily after a few hours of use, but I suspect it is not. Yes, it's aesthetically pleasing, but that factor may just be masking some of the deficits in its performance."
4,Nice Product,Nice value & quality - keep up with the routine maintence - takes up little room & very quiet...Good Choice
2,Broke after one season of use,Worked great for the one winter we used it. When the spring came and I tried to use it again for my sons allergies it just let out a burning smell.
2,Works well. Until it breaks,"I bought this from Target about a year ago. It worked well and pumped out lots of cool mist. However, my unit failed in a very bad way. The ultrasonic element overheated and detached from the base of the humidifier causing the contents of the tank to flow through the device(and the powered fan) on to my table and on to the floor.I suspect this device has a design flaw in the empty tank detector. It always shut off the fan correctly but I bet it never shut off the ultrasonic element."
1,Poor Penguin,"The Penguin humidifier is truly adorable--and for about a week it was incredibly wonderful. Completely quiet--little penguin gently misted the bedroom. Then one day I smelled that electric burning smell and ran to the bedroom. There was plenty of water in penquin, and he was misting away--but he surely smelled like something was wrong. I unplugged penguin and emptied the water and took a look. There was a small crack in the plastic base which seemed like it would allow water to leak through to the motor. Hmmm. Poor little penquin went into the trash--I sent more plastic to the landfill. A sad end for all. I am hoping that this was just a freak accident of my penquin--and the rest of the penquins and frogs and so forth are still going strong. But I don't think I want to drop another 30 bucks to find out."
1,Terrible product,"This product always had problems. I'd turn it on and I'd hear the sounds of water bubbling, but no mist would come out. I'd open it up and see all of the mist trapped on the inside. I learned that it would only work if I turned it on immediately after placing the frog head on top, while the water was pouring into the basin. So that was okay, it was inconvenient but I could deal with that. Then after a few months, it stopped working altogether. The green light turns on, and if I open it up I can see the water swirling in the center, but no mist forms.Even when it did work, it didn't do a good job humidifying the room. This product is more about looks than function. Not recommended."
5,Very Cute!,Very cute humidifier.It works good and looks quite cute! Better than I thought.I really love it. Enjoy it!
2,"Very poor quality, broken after 2 weeks","The quality of this product is very poor. After we use this product for about 2 weeks, it stops working. Other than that, it does its job. Overall I don't recommend it."
1,Spoke too soon - quit working after 6 weeks,"Just plugged this in for the first time - hope it works this well for the next few years.HA!Quiet, puts out good humidity.NOT ANYMORE _ Note that was before it quit working after about 6 weeks. After 1 week it made weird sounds when I turned it on. I found that if I turned the wheel in the base a bit it would work but that worked 2x. I think the fan is broken. It creates mist which either stays in with the water or leaks out the back bottom a bit. Not enough fan to get the mist up to the penguin's beak.I spent too much money on this to have it break down after so little use. Will be contacting Crane on Monday for suggestions. I hate filters so will be looking for a better made product that is also filter free."
4,Good Product,"This product is great. It is whisper quiet, and does not leave a condensation film on the furniture and wall. It is slightly difficult to clean, but not bad. My first one actually cracked but I sent it back and was immediately sent a new one free of charge. I would recommend this product to friends."
3,Warning label should be attached,". . . to every humidifier. I used this quite happily for a winter, always cleaning it and using distilled water. Great product and very quiet.Lately I've developed a horribly terrifying reaction that, at first, I did not attribute to the humidifier. Shortness of breath, fever, chest pain. After Googling for a while (and many doctor visits) I found exactly what was wrong; Humidifier Fever. Check it out and ask yourself if it is worth buying a humidifier."
4,"Good product, will not dispoint you","The humidifier is a good product, you can select from different shapes for kids. It is quite."
4,Smart purchase,"My yonger son is in love with everything that relates to trains, so naturally he was extremely happy when we got him Thomas the Tank. Now he only goes to bed if his new toy is lit and puffing white clouds into the air. He doesn't mind that it's a bit noisy.So far the humidifier has performed well, no mechanical breakdowns to report. It's very cute, easy to operate, maintenance free - just fill up with tap water and plug in.One little plastic trim piece has come off, and that's why I'm giving this product 4 stars and not 5, but to me that's a minor quibble compared to the piece of mind knowing that my kid is happy falling asleep with his favorite train humming piecefully next to his bed."
4,Very nice Humidifier .. Pain to clean though !,I have been using this product for almost 2 years now ! Here is my snapshot review:Pros :1. Quiet2. Very easy to setup/use.3. Does what it is supposed to.Con:1. Gets bacteria quite frequently requiring a thorough cleaning.2. Cleaning is a pain since it has hard to reach areas which are visibly covered in bacteria.3. Sometimes leaks water so I have to place a plastic cover below it.
3,Quit working in 2 months,"I liked everything about this, the cow is so cute, very quiet and worked well enough for my baby's small room and was very affordable! However it simply quit after 2 months. No, we didnot do anything different. it just stopped working!"
5,the only humidifier to become part of the family ...,"My daughter loves her humidifer so much that my husband insisted we name it, and so ""Daisy"" is a permanent resident in her room. Even during the off season! After a year of near-constant use, I find the motor to be quiet, the mist consistent, and (with sensible handling - duh, you'll need a towel!) the maintenance is a piece of cake. This purchase was a duplicate for her new ""big girl"" room, so now we will have TWO Daisys. (Poor old mom gets stuck with the boring Vicks model!) Great price and a reliable product - the extreme cuteness factor is just a bonus in my book."
4,"Good product, wish it had a lock mechanism","This is the second Humidifier that I own, overall I am pleased with it, the only problem is that I have a toddler at home who loves to push the penguin head causing samll flood, I wish it had a lock mechanism to secure the pegnuin head (water compartment)"
5,Very good humidifier,"I bought this cute humidifier 1 month ago to replace my old one. Compared to my old one, this is very convenient to use. You don't need to use purified water, which is necessary for my old one.Very good product. Low price, good quality, cute appearance."
5,Great product we use RO filter water to keep them clean!,"Purchased the penguin for my son's room and the Hello Kitty for my daughter's room. They both have adjustable misters and are extremely quiet. The Hello Kitty also has a night light which is a nice little bonus. We use a GE reverse osmosis water filtration system for drinking water and to fill the tanks of the humidifiers. This keeps the humidifiers extremely clean with no mineral deposits whatsoever! In fact, we rarely need to clean the humidifiers."
1,Made Us Sick!!,"There are too many nooks and crannies for pathogens like mold, fungus or bacteria. It is near impossible to get this thing well-cleaned. You cannot get your hand or a scrub brush into the basin to thoroughly remove residue or film. I noticed that after a few months of use, the humidifier actually made my family and me very sick. We had flu-like symptoms and I was short of breath. It turns out the the cool mist humdifier was making us sick by dispersing a commonly found bacteria into the air (Serratia marcescens). We could not remove the pink film completely from the humidifier so we threw it out. Actually, we had TWO - an elephant and a frog. We didn't have to worry about bacteria in the frog because it croaked within weeks of using it!! Junk. If you are susceptible to lung irritants, consider an evaporative humidifier. Check out this great info from the Mayo Clinic: [...]"
2,Be careful with the handle,"The handle for the water ressevoir broke off the first time we used it. Otherwise it works OK, just be gentle on the handle."
2,Quit working,"Worked geat for the four months I had it in my son's room. Suddenly, just topped working today. Of course, it's outside of the return window now :/ I have the penguin one in my other son's room, and a teardrop one in mine.... Those are sill going strong. I guess I just got a faulty one. Still frustrating."
2,Worked only for 2 months,It was working good for 2 months. Then one fine day.. it stopped working. No mist. I can hear the motor working inside but no mist is coming out.
2,I would suggest a different product.,It was good for three months but after that it started making noise and crapped out after one year. Looks good but not the best product.
4,Good humidifier,"I like this one, it's quiet, simple to operate (only has an on/off switch and a knob to increase humidity output), and was fairly low cost. And I don't have to worry about cleaning the mineral buildup like I have to with warm mist humidifiers, cause there is none (that probably means it's going into the air along with the mist, but I'll worry about that later). The only thing is I like the feeling of warm mist going into the air better than the cool ultrasonic mist from this one, but it's not that much of a difference. Plus my honeywell warm mist humidifier broke after 1 year and I had to send it in for warranty repair, so I bought this one as a backup. It works good and has good humidity, low cost compared to most warm mist ones. The tank could be larger, but if the humidity knob is set right it should last a day or more."
2,Not worth it,"I am not sure about it's usefulness anymore.First, it covers my furniture with white film very often, making me dust every 2-3 days. I am worried it can eventually ruin my furniture.Second, I think I am getting sore throat from it. I stopped using it a couple of times, and every time I turn it on, i get a sore throat in about a day or two.. Sounds strange, maybe it's not from the humidifier. But .. i stopped using it. I am thinking of returning it."
3,Worked only for one season,"It's adorable and worked great for the one season that it worked. Then the button got stuck inside and when we took it apart, we found the frame housing for the button was cracked and could not be fixed. I also realized that I prefer the mist to shoot straight up so that it has more opportunity to evaporate before it falls to the floor- the mist from the penguin comes out horizontally. You may be better off with one of the other creatures where the mist shoots up."
1,It wouldn't turn on,"I flipped the switch and it wouldn't turn on. Even the troubleshooting section in the manual said if it didn't turn on, then it's defective.The control knob kind of felt cheap.The base of the penguin head was chipped but you can't see the chip if you put the head onto the body.As others have stated, the tank is difficult to fill because you turn the penguin body upsidedown to fill and it won't stay standing because the bottom is pointy (the top side, but you turn it upsidedown)."
3,Not as nice as a expected......,"I bought this for my son's room. It works pretty well, except for water collects in between the water canister and the ""head"" part of the dragon. And the dial to set the strength of the humidity isn't very good. You have to turn it up all the way till it starts then turn it to your desired setting. But it is a good humidifier and my son loves it!! So all in all, it was a good purchase."
1,It lasts only one season,"I had high hopes for this relatively inexpensive humidifier after reading the reviews on here, and it worked well for one winter. But this year, it makes a horrible grinding noise whenever it is operated. That despite following the instructions to the letter on cleaning and operation. And, of course, the warranty is only one year. So it's heading to the trash. If you want to spend the money for a product that might get you through one season, go ahead. Those looking for a product that is actually reliable should look elsewhere."
2,Cute but quit...,"working after about 6 weeks. My husband has done all he can to try to fix it, but to no avail. Too bad, as we like the design and it puts out a fine vapor (when working)."
4,"Crane ""Owl"" Humidifier","I previously had Mr. Frog, but accidently dropped the tank & it cracked! Which brings me to the main disadvantage & 4-star rating: the tanks are awkward to handle in refilling; they don't have a flat-bottomside, so be careful & be sure you have plenty of counter space (or basket in kit. sink) to sit, while youdisassemble/reassemble. Like all humidifiers, they're not super-easy to clean; best to just empty &rinse this when you're not going to use it that day; give it a thorough washing/DRYING as instructed before storing for the season.Otherwise, they come in so many characters/colors & they work GREAT! It's amazing: the cool steamwill start shooting out almost immediately--depending on a higher setting to start. The Owl is quiterealistic, as was the Frog."
5,Works Perfectly,"The only words of caution would be to make sure you buy and use distilled water if you do not like to take it apart a clean residue. Have now bought 2, one for each kids room and they sleep so much better and soundly."
1,Great while working,"Don't get me wrong. I really like this humidifier. Cute, silent, humidifying rooms very well. Actually I bought another one. The only thing I did not like was the tank shape. It was hard to hold to fill with water.The real big problem is: it died so quickly. One I bought this year died within a couple of months. I do not know mine was a lemon. I may tell to see how the other one fares (I started to use this one about a month ago)."
3,best dust maker in the world,"If you dont mind white thin dust everywhere this product works fairly well as a humidifier. I bought for my over heated super dry dorm room and unless I was with in 4 feet of the unit it was very ineffective. If you plan to use it for a child, place it close to their room.(I even have the filter and it didnt help with the dust as all.)"
1,Great ornament!,"Lenny the leopard is a great topic of conversation when I have visitors to my home. He is a funny character! He work for a single use and since then sits around like a true cat and does nothing. I take the loss of money I paid for him to be a humidifier as a lesson to myself. I will elsewhere for such needs in the future. Sorry Crane company, I have no time for your ineptitude.So if you want a fun ornament for your house like me, buy one. If you want a humidifier then find a company that actually makes one."
1,Not a good choice,"The base arrived with a small crack in it. Filling the top with water and placing it on the base just caused the small crack to become a huge crack and needless to say, I had to send it back. I definitely do not recommend this product. Even if it did not arrive already cracked, it is so top-heavy that I really think it would have wound up cracked anyway due to the weight of the water pressing down on the flimsy plastic base."
3,works great but has odor like burnt plastic after a few uses,I purchased this items after reading the reviews. It works great for the first months of 2009. Just started to use for this winter but there is some odor like burnt plastic. will need to see if it can be replaced.
2,the vapor comes out of the bottom of the humidifier,"I'm not sure if a filter is needed for this spongebob. When I first bought it last winter, the humidifier worked great, and it's very quiet. But now it refuses to work properly. The vapor comes out from the bottom instead of the top holes. The reason, I think, is because its fan(in the bottom) stops to work."
4,We liked it,It Did well until I dropped it and the top broke. I have to order another one. I was hoping to find it cheaper.
2,Works Well but Poor Design,"This humidifier works well and is cute BUT is poorly designed... there doesn't seem to be any way to take the top off for refilling without spilling water everywhere, and then it's awkward to refill because when you flip it over it does not rest flat. Overall kind of a pain to use."
4,Not as good as penquin,"I borrowed the Penguin from a neighbor which was awesome so I purchased this one only because of the color. Slightly disappointed because it doesn't seem to produce as must steam as the penquin. I'm not sure if their is a difference in power or output, but thought I would share."
3,It's true . . .,"It's true, the penguin is really adorable and when the green light is on and it's working, I love it. But the red light keeps coming on for no known reason. And I hate to sleep with the penguin on for fear the light will turn red after an hour and stay red all night. I'm not sure what to do and the accompanying booklet does not seem to address this problem. sigh . . . Any ideas?"
1,Tossed this out after just 2 months!,"I would like to warn anyone away from buying this product. We purchased this product and when I went to clean it after a couple of weeks, I noticed there was some strange peeling of the black ring on the inside. Two weeks later I went to clean it again and the situation was worse - it looked like corosion and peeling paint and gunk. It was so gross, I just tossed the product and wrote Target about it, where I first purchased it. We also purchased the red dragon from the same set and it was doing the same thing. A total waste of money. Also, the handles are useless as the accompanying literature advises not to use the handles to carry the unit once filled with water."
2,the first humidifier,"It was broken when I opened the box, so I asked for exchange. Amazon was quick to response."
3,Get what you pay,"The out nozzle and the penguine cap are not aligned resulting in less than stellar stream strength. I'd opt for the Frog or Elephant for better results. By the way, there is no filter. You can buy those for a whopping ~$10 more. However, all being said and done this is perfect for my cubicle in the office. Besides, the IT people all think I'm swell as a penguine is associated with Linux. Who'd a thunk it!?"
2,Poor Engineering,"I did a lot of research before buying this humidifier; the engineering that went into it was offensive! Replacing the cap after filling the tank was always a frustrating experience; it would often take 5-7 tries to get the lid to screw on correctly. Also, I felt that the cool-mist technology wasn't superior to warm-mist; you can see the mist not dispersing into the air (cold sinks, right?). I took it back and got a Vick's vaporizer...it's much better and simply picked up at Walmart during any regular trip~"
2,"Cute, but that's about it","I'll admit that I bought this humidifer over other onse because I thought it looked cute. I also relied on other reviews that said that they have had great success with it. My problem with this humidifer is that it doesn't properly work.The mist created by the humidifier is not fine (as in size). And since it's cool, it only rises about 3-6 inches from the vents and then immediately sinks. If you're trying to humidify a room, you'd have to keep it on all day and keep it up high.Filling the basin is more of a pain than it should be. It must be filled upside down and carried supporting the bottom. The manual recommends not using the handles when the basin is filled with water.The one thing I did like about this humidifer is that it is relatively quiet. Even at the highest setting, I was able to sleep.While this humidifer might look nice in a kids room, it won't do a whole lot. Better of finding one that works over one that's cute."
5,High quality product,I really love it!! So cute !!! This really worths buying. I highly recommend this one~and you can choose some other animals like peg and pegion. They are also cute.
2,broke,it broke within a month but it's really cute. It's just fragile and not well designed to be run on long term. or maybe perhaps I got a defect product. not sure
4,Cute :),"I purchased this for my five year old to prevent colds, sore throat and chapped lips...so far so good. She sleeps and breaths better through out the night. Why purchase a regular boring humidifier when she could have a cute one that doesn't even look like one?!"
1,worked at first,When i first bought this product it was great now it won't turn on and its only few mths old. I don't have receipt so can not return it just stuck with a broken humidifier.
2,Works only if you're within 2-3 feet of it,You literally have to be right next to it to make any difference. Wish I would have bought a real humidifier. This is more of a toy...
1,Garbage. Poor maufacturing quality,"My unit was semi- dead on arrival. It leaked very badly. After some investigation, I determined that a plastic piece that should be glued/welding to the tank became detached, allowing water to leak. This piece is placed inside the tank and glued, not an easy repair. The unit is not usable.I called the manufacturer and they would not send me a free replacement without a receipt, which I unfortunately did not purchase on Amazon. They wanted $27 for a new tank. Total ripoff. Bad quality control. I will attempt to repair it myself."
4,Frog humidifier,"It came packaged safely and product was easy to set up and use. It works perfectly and is adorable. The only thing I thought was strange that it does not come with the filter that ""is recommended."""
5,LOVE IT!,"I love this thing. My baby's doctor told me that I needed to get a cool mist humidifier because of his allergies and boogers/snot in his nose. Recently he had bronchitis and was coughing all night. The night I put this in the room he went all night without coughing. It made me sleep better too. It feels so good with the cool mist in the air, I loved it. My 10 year old wants one in his room now too!"
4,Cute product for children's room,I bought two of these humidifiers for my toddler's rooms. I got the elephant and the dragon models. The elephant is adorable and works great. The only fault is that it is a pain to turn on. With the dragon model there is an on/off switch but with the elephant there is just a dial and trying to turn it on is a bit tricky. Not sure if it's just a defective dial that I got or if all the models are like this. It is very easy to fill and the water lasts a 2-3 days with it set 1/2 way. I have had it for over a month and would recommend this to my friends.
2,Traps mildew and mold- hard to clean!,"The inside of this tank has so many cracks and crevices that mildew and mold collect in spots that are impossible to clean, even with wire brushes! I follow the instructions to clean it with vinegar and even do it 2x a week. It is used so frequently that the tank is rinsed and refilled a lot. I have another Crane (the tear drop shaped one) and have NEVER had a problem with mildew/mold growing. This Duck has serious design flaws...it may be cute, but stick with the simple designs that can be kept clean!!"
2,crane humidifier,This humidifier ran great until I used a filter with it. Now it is loud and does not work right. I would not recommend this product as it requires numerous cleanings also.
4,Good so far,"This humidifier works well for how much it cost, and I'm satisfied so far. It's relatively easy to fill and it lasts for a while. I haven't done any humidity measurements to see how effective this product is, but the streams of vaporized water coming out the cow ears work psychologically for me. My fiance loves the cowness of it, so that's a plus.I used to wake up with a dry throat and the occasional bloody nose, but it hasn't happened much recently (perhaps still a little dry in the throat). Since the weather is warming up there's no way for me to tell which factor is really contributing.Given that many of the bad reviews for this product have been more long-term product failures, it makes sense that this review is a little positive. I'll update if anything bad happens."
3,Headless Penguin Ok,"I really liked the design, and the Crane seemed rated well, but when the penguin head is attached it's hard to see any vapor coming out even at full blast. Take the head off, and it works fine. Not sure if the other 'heads' have the same issue. Fortunately this one looks fine without the head on."
3,Great (when it works),"I made the decision to buy 4 of these humidifiers after it got great reviews from Consumer Reports, which is how I choose most things these days. Two of these units malfunctioned within a few weeks. They start up, but then make a loud buzzing noise and stop producing the water vapor. I've tried cleaning them out with new water, making sure there wasn't any contaminates on the part that makes the vapor but couldn't get them to stop malfunctioning. The other two work great and have helped reduce the dryness in my children's bedrooms. I don't plan on replacing them with the same units since a 50% defective rate isn't worth the aggravation in my opinion."
1,"Good, for about a year.","Didn't use this product too often. Maybe a few weeks out of the year. We stored and cleaned it properly in between uses. A little more than a year after purchase, the internal fan became unbalanced and the unit developed a loud noise as a result. The noise was too loud to run the unit for our sleeping baby. So, in the trash. Hope you have better luck than we did if you end up buying this unit. We will be buying something else next time around."
2,water leak in the first time use,"Got this very fast and timely, can generate a lot moisture, but have water leak after 2 hours use, returned it and as always, amazon did very smooth transaction in refund."
2,"It's cute, but...",Received the frog today and it worked right out of the box and is very cute but doesn't do much to actually humidify a room. Will be sending it back.
3,really cool but of bad quality,It looks really cool and as soon as I took it out of the.box my son loved it. But it is a bit louder than the duck and came cracked. I hope it makes it through the end of the winter.
2,penguin problem,"Adorable for sure, but problematic. I accidently ordered 2 at first.. Good thing I did because the first one I opened had a peice broken off in the base AND the head of the penguin was scratched. The second one was amazing... for the first 2 days. The whole unit itself stopped working. I tried called customer service and tried everything I could and we were unable to get it going. So I've had to return both of them. I'm leary of trying out a 3rd one, as I mentioned it did work great, very Silent and adjustable!, but I might try a differnt design."
1,It is a toy not a humidifier,Am I missing something? How this product got such good reviews? Are these people using this product during summer or winter? What I know about humidifer normally people use during winter. I live in virginia and I bought this product in December. I kept this humidifier on for 5 hours and the humidity monitor did not show any change. I stopped using this after 2 days and planning to return.
4,Pretty Good,"When I first got this humidifier, it was broken. So I had to send it back to Amazon, who by the way were so fantastic about the return. Well, when the new one came, two day shipping!, it worked great. My only complaint would be that there's a funky smell whenever I use it. I've tried cleaning it and putting good smelly stuff in it, like febreeze and vaporub but the smell just keeps on coming back. So other than that it's a great little humidifier. The smell isn't strong or really all that terrible, it's just a little annoying."
3,its okay,"I don't really know much about humidifiers so can't write a precise review but I bought this product after reading other reviews and also the cost. I guess its a basic humidifier. You have to have certain speed or you won't feel any difference in the air. The water filling accessibility is fine, no complaints there. On and all, its an okay thing for a small sized room."
4,Good product but one small issue,"I recieved this Humidifer for my son who has allergies and Acid Reflux and it worked great for about a week, then out of nowhere it stopped working. Amazon replaced it and we recieved another one. We got the new one, filled it up and went to turn it on it didnt work. I was really begining to get upset that I recieved two defective ones. Butwe got to fooling around with it and the plugs come off of the power switch. So remember if yours quits working check those plugs :) other than that it works GREAT"
4,"Huge tank, works great, tricky to clean","We have had this cute humidifier for a year, and it works great.My only complaints are that the tank is heavy when full and can be tricky not to spill when turning it over. Also, when the tank is empty, water still collects in the base, which you have to unplug to remove."
4,Great product,I love it so much.It has greatly improved the humidity of my girls room since we started using it.
2,Not a good choice!,"I used this for the first time today. During operation, it makes a pleasant bubbly water sound (not enough to keep you awake at all).However, when I went to refill it for overnight use, I noticed it had leaked all over the table! (Since this happened to my mother's cool mist humidifier, I'm wondering if this happens to all of them!) It was also broken on the bottom (motor) piece, and had not been before use this morning."
1,Break easily,"First time I ordered this item was when my daughter was born and it was last about 2 years. In January 2011, it stopped working so I ordered another one to replace it. However, after using the new one for a few weeks, the fan became so loud so I returned it and ordered a new one. This time, it was last a little bit over a month then the same issue occurred. I have to communicate with Amazon customer services for return because it is over 30 days. Luckily, the representative helped me to return it. I won't order it again. I think the quality of this product is poorly controlled."
3,"Cute, but...","We have both the penguin and the frog. Yeah, it's cute. Yes, it works fine. BUT (and it's a big but) -- those cute, bumpy eyes make it very awkward to fill. And you'll be filling it every couple of days, over a period of 4 months or so, if you live in the Northeast, like we do. For me, that's worked out to a lot of cussing at the kitchen sink! So, Froggy, you're cute, but if I had it to do again, I'd buy another penguin -- the original, and still the best."
3,Cute with a few draw backs,"This is a cute humidifier, but the night light doesn't work well. I think water gets into the bulb part. It works for a moment or two when it is first illuminated but then it flickers off and sometimes back on again. That feature doesn't seem safe so we never use it. Also, if the head part isn't put on just right the water accumulates and leaves drippy pools of water on the night stand. I've lost a few books that were put beside it that way. It works well other than those draw backs."
1,Leaked,"I ordered this for my son's room. I used it once, and it worked fine. I didn't think anything of not emptying it b/c he would use it again that night. However, when I went to his room that evening, the humidifier had leaked all over his dresser and onto the floor. I tested it again later in the bathtub. I made sure I had it closed tightly and it wasn't leaking when I put the container on it. However, it leaked again all over the tub. I was very disappointed and plan to return it."
1,Poor,Product didn't work. It was broken.I tried to contact the seller but didn't have any anwser.Just loose my money.And the product was sent to other country and they do not have technical assistance.
4,Love it!,I was looking for a humidifer that would not soak me while I was sleeping. This works just fine and is cute to look at. I like the control levels and ease of operation.
2,Broke Quick,I really loved this humidifier because it's so cute... even with all the maintenance of making sure it is cleared out every night etc my humidifier broker after 2 1/2 months. I'm so upset because my return time is up and the motor just stopped running... ugh!
2,"Cute, but not worth the money","I purchased the Elephant humidifier for my son's nursery, and it worked well for about 10 months. We did not run it every night - only when he was congested. First it started making strange noises when we would turn it on, which made us wonder how much longer it would last. Then my son accidentally knocked it over and the tank broke. We had it set on a small stool (about one foot off of the ground), so we were surprised that there was a huge hole in the side of the tank after such a short fall. Given the strange noises it was making and how easily it broke, I would not recommend."
2,Try another brand,"We purchased this item from a different retailer in January 2011, by October the fan motor went out. My husband tried to access the fan to fix the problem, but couldn't. For the money, spend an extra $10 and buy a brand that starts with V and rhymes with ""sticks"". It's not as cute, but it will last a lot longer than the eight months that this one did."
4,Still going strong,I purchased the cow humidifier 2 years ago ans it still works beautifully. I live in Tucson where the air can be very dry. I was constantly waking up with irritated sinuses and dry throat. After purchasing the humidifier my symptoms were alleviated and it has helped reduce my allergy symptoms too. The unit is very quiet a big plus since I placed it on my nightstand. The cuteness doesn't hurt either :)
5,"Quite, Clean, and So Cute!","I love this humidifier. It's quite and clean (sometimes the vapor stinks with other humidifiers), and the vapor comes out of the elephant's trunk. It's really cute. There's no filter which means no additional things to constantly buy! It lasts a long time and has an auto shut off when water runs out which is cool for parents who leave it on for white noise. The bottom of the humidifier is elevated so water doesn't trap under there and run the risk of mold buildup or just a mess in general."
4,"Its alright for the price, still testing it out","Ok, I got the dog humidifier, its cute and durable. At first I was wondering why the heck was my table getting soaked from the steam, but yes, you do have to adjust the steam, it should go up into the air and not arch downward, so don't put it on the highest setting, it will defeat the purpose. I like the sound of it, and its so calming that it puts the baby to sleep. The only problem is that I put some Eucalyptus oil into it, but didn't smell it in the vapor. I did feel the difference in the air, because in my room there is dry air, but when I used this product I felt the moisture. I did just purchase this product and used it only 3 times, so if I notice any other problems I will be back."
1,Quacked out,"It's so cute, and even more worthless. I was trying to make a necessity not so boring to look at, but instead just wasted my money! Mr. Duck only worked for about 2 weeks...we retired him for a boring, normal-looking, less-expensive humidifier. And BONUS: it works!"
1,CRANE Thomas the Tank needs to goto SODOR for repair!!!!,"As with the reviewer of the Wachsmuth & Krogmann Thomas the Tank Engine, that clear little plastic piece designed to light up the tank fell into the tank after the third time we filled it. Then water leaked everywhere, including onto the electronics. Apparently the plastic is simply glued into the tank and with even the slightest touch it falls back inside. When you place the tank back onto Thomas this piece fits over the other clear plastic piece that houses the actual bulb light. This apparently is enough to cause the piece to loosen and fall into the tank. There is no way to fix this or any warning NOT to touch it. In the course of normal filling its almost guaranteed you will touch this at some time. I dont know about you, but mixing toddlers, water and electricity is a recipe for DISASTER!!CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED ANYWHERE NEAR THIS PRODUCT!! THIS IS A MAJOR DEFECT AND SAFETY HAZARD!!!! THE PRODUCT SHOULD BE RECALLED!!!"
1,Have you ever tried to clean this thing?,Have you ever tried to clean this product.Over time collects mold and build ups and it is impossible to clean it because it has too many hard to reach places!!! It does not spread the mist around either. So you end-up with a wet spot on the floor or the surrounding area.Overall I consider it quiet but hard to clean. I do not like the fact that when you change the water you also have to bring with you a large bowl to throw the water remaining in the base of the humidifier which is ridiculous.I have recently checked if the product was modified. The company has not made any changes on it for the last 3-4 years. I am looking to buy a different kind.
1,"I take back my ""great"" rating","We love this product. It has been a fun way to use a humidifier for out daughter. It's easy to clean and care for. Love it.This was my original review. However, here I am three months later with a broken humidifier. I had cleaned it out for the season and was about to put it in the closet when our daughter got a really nasty cold. She has not been sleeping due to congestion, and I figured the humidifier would help a little. When I plugged it in and turned it on, the fan wouldn't come on. I have tried everything I could think of to come to the realization that it is broken. Perfect. And right when our girl is sick. I guess I should have listened to the other reviews, and not given in just because it was cute. I am currently trying to figure out what my next step is in returning it or getting it repaired."
1,"quiet, but wet","This humidifier is very quiet, but gets everything around it soaking wet. The mist rises about a foot and then condenses on everything just below it. Sent it back."
1,Cute but doesn't humidify!,This thing does not have a mist that shoots out of the kitty's ears. It's more like a vapor that stays right by the ears. We have a meter to measure humidity (yes we're that dorky) and after a night of running the Hello Kitty machine the humidity didn't budge. We are returning this item and are going to get a good old fashined humidifier from Walgreens. Maybe we just got a dud because I read other good reviews.
2,So cute. Only worked for 2 months.,I absolutely love penguins & thought this humidifier would look really cute in my daughters room. But it only lasted 2 months before it just quit producing the mist. I took very good care of it but it just doesn't work anymore.
2,Leaked after two months,"I was happy in the beginning. Then i had to clean it thoroughly, the odor appears from the residue on the bottom, it worked for a bit and started leaking very badly. It damaged the dresser it was on. I don't like to bother with online returns, so i threw it away, still sorry for the money i spent.Don't know what to get next."
5,Adorable AND Easy,"I am really enjoying this humidifier. I like that it doesn't need a filter (I have not even noticed any white dust from using tap water). I also like that the size is manageable-- it is much easier for me to fill than something bigger would be and the small size also means that there isn't much chance for the water to get stale. It lasts a decent amount of time-- I have it turned up pretty high (another good thing-- adjustable output!) and it seems to last between 24 and 36 hours. I haven't had any of the problems other posters have mentioned-- no white dust, no leaking (condensation does drip a little bit when you take the water tank off, but it is not a big deal), very quiet, the little green light doesn't even bother me!. Really, I am just very happy with it so far-- it is completely adorable and works great!"
4,quiet and light,"I have been using it for about a month, it is easy to operate and add water, very quiet so It can be on all ngiht."
5,Would Totally Reccomend this product!!,Not only is this product really easy to use and clean...it also works really well. We have been extremely happy with it.
1,broken after a few days,"It last about 3-4 days. No mist coming out. Read through the user's manual and it seems to break easily if water gets into a hole at the water basin, which I can imagine happens to everyone in the daily refill."
1,Hazard,"I originally purchased this so my frogs could have consistent humidity while I am at work and school. After a month of using this like a charm it stopped working properly and became quite a hazard. There are several reasons why it could have stopped working, but the main giveaway was the toxic smell of the inside parts frying. I noticed when I turned it on that the fog has been coming out from the bottom instead of the top. When I unscrewed the bottom to take a look inside everything was corroded. When I tried to reassemble it the screws where impossible to get back in.I am debating if I should have a crap product replaced with $15 shipping or recreate my own bludgeoning scene from Office Space.was it work the money I paid for? Absolutely not. personally, I am done buying from Amazon."
1,cute but totally useless,I picked this product based on it's cute clever design. So it is probably my fault that the thing is totally useless no later than 15 days after I plugged it in. I would not recommend this product to anyone who wants a functioning humidifier.
2,Great at first...,"I bought this humidifier based on all of the great reviews. And for the first couple months, the humidifier worked great. Now unfortunately the red light continues to come on and the mist does not spray out. Apparently you have to exchange it within about a month of purchase, so I cannot exchange it. I don't know if I'd really recommend this or not since mine doesn't really work now."
2,Who says it's quiet?,It's very loud when working and I don't believe it can be put in to a baby's room with that kind of noise. Don't recommend it for anyone or any baby who needs a sound sleep...
2,not efficient,"Have used this for 3 years and recently I've decided to replace it with a more powerful one. The relative humidity (RH) is around 30% in my bedroom. The room is small, only 12 sq metres (about 130 sq ft) and keeping it running all night only raises RH to about 40%. It may be enough for a number of people but it's still too dry for me.I remember that the manual says 1 gallon of water for 11 hours, so the output is about 344ml/hour... almost the smallest output among all humidifiers. I'd try one with output ~500ml/hr, or, 3 gallon/day."
3,Worked great at first!,"I'm kind of disappointed in this Crane humidifier, we bought it last winter to replace another Crane humidifier that we had for almost 2 years and saw constant use. We bought this one around November 2011 and used it all winter in my son's room. I emptied it around April and it sat unused until about 2 weeks ago. I just went to turn it on and it's making a horrible sound as if the motor is gone. Mist will still come out but the sound is awful. I guess this one is going in the trash and I will be hunting down the Crane Drop Shape humidifier asap. I would not recommend this product. I do love Crane humidifiers for the very reason that they don't get moldy unless you don't rinse and empty them when not in use."
4,Crane penguin humidifier,Love the design and my son loves it! Works great and my son can turn it on and off and adjust the mist on his own. Easy to clean and I like how you can add a de-mineralization cartridge to the water tank. Doesn't grow mold as fast as other ones we've had in the past. My only dislike is how small the tank is. It just means refilling it more often since we live in CO where it's really dry.
1,This product is junk,"The only good thing about this product is that it's cute. After owning it for 10 months, it started to leak and I now have to replace it. Don' waste your time with this one - spend the money to get a good one."
1,Worked great!!! ...for three days,"The first night I used this humidifier, I thought it was great! It was very quiet and seemed to do the job well. After only three uses, however, I have noticed that it stops emitting mist after about an hour, but the fan continues to run. The water in the base is warm, indicating that the motor is overheating. I plan on trying to return it today."
4,Quiet and Effective,I'm very happy with this humifier. It seems more effective than the others we have in the house. We can set the cool steam volumn to whatever we desire and it quickly and quietly adjusts.
3,Nice Humidifier,"Good humidifier, cute looking.If you turn it to high, you will hear water dripping noise, you have to turn the control to medium to eliminate that noise."
4,Works great.,"This humidifier is not only cute, but it does the job. It's quiet too. The only thing I would change, is the direction the air blows out. I'd prefer it to blow up instead of straight out."
4,"Works well, but humming sound","We bought this a month ago, when the weather was really cold and dry, so needless to say, we were pleasantly surprised and appreciative that it arrived within 2 days from Amazon, with free shipping.Being that this is our first humidifier, so I have no other comparisons. But it was easy to set up, and we do use filtered water as adviced by other reviewers.One most important thing to note is that there is a faint motor humming sound when turned on, which can be quite annoying if you are used to sleeping in an almost completely quiet room.... not sure if this sound is normal though. There is also a water gurgling sound every once in a while at medium to high setting.Other than the sounds, this humidifier does work, and the cow is adorable."
3,Meh,"It was so cute...I had much higher expectations of it. The mist comes out and everything, but I never noticed the room to be more humid, even if it was running 24/7. Also it takes quite a bit of maintenance - their recommended cleaning instructions don't account for the mineral buildup that is really hard to clean off. In the future, i'm choosing function over form."
2,"too cute, but broke....2x on us","I love how this looked in my daughter's room. Dont buy it. I got one as a gift, and then it broke, so I bought another one to replace it. And after 2 months it broke again. I kept the warranty this time, and hope to replace it but what a hassel. not worth the money.."
4,"works well and easy to use,but...","I bought this for a good price, and this ""Crane Adorable"" humidifier does what it's supposed to(in other words, works perfectly!). I decided to give this four stars because of two small things. Refilling this with water is not very practical/easy, and when you set the humidifer for anything but the lowest level/setting, it gets kind of noisy.Overall, I would recommend this product. It looks really good(kids will like it for the design), works well, and is easy to use."
2,Stop Working,"I bought this humidifer and it worked well for a while, but no matter how well I tried to clean the machine it got really nasty. The night light stopped working almost immediately which really upset my 4 year old daughter."
4,Cute humidifier.,"The best thing about this humidifier is it's really cute so my baby loves it. She actually gets excited when I bring him out and put it on. Besides being cute, it's a good humidifier in that it's a cool mist so it's safe for children. It uses ultrasonic technology so you don't need a filter although there is a demineralization filter for it you can use in order to prevent mineral build-up if your water is too hard. It has a mist adjustment knob which is nice. The only thing I don't like about it is the cleaning and maintenance is pretty extensive. Otherwise it's a great humidifier and has made my baby's skin noticeably better."
2,Looks better than it works...,"Maybe I'm just unlucky, but I received a bit of a dud with this Hello Kitty humidifier. It arrived with the pink bow broken off which I surmise occurred sometime during shipping, so I glued it back on. For two days, it worked fine. You could see the cool mist as it emitted from slits at the tops of the ears and, coupled with the soft purple night light, it looked great. By the third night, the light had stopped working, but at least the humidifier still did its work.... for another week or so.I don't know if this is normal, but there was an awful lot of loose water pooling at the base. And now, just a couple of weeks in, the humidifier no longer silent purrs. It's hums and rattles LOUDLY... having never been dropped or mistreated in any way. It looks GREAT in my daughter's nursery, but at this point, it serves as little more than a decoration... and a reminder that I wasted my money."
1,DO NOT BUY !!!,"Do not buy this item it caught fire after the first use , luckiy someone was awake to put it out or who knows what could have happened."
2,short lived,2 months and this unit no longer works. I walked into my daughter's room and it was off. I tried to turn it off and back on to see if that would work and nothing. :( VERY DISAPPOINTED because I thought this was the cutest and quietest unit I have purchased. And Amazon is not accepting this return because they say the time to return this unit expired. :( Now I have to purchase a new one. I'M NOT HAPPY!! I don't recommend this unit.
4,cute and works,i've only used it for a few nights and it's good so far. it's very cute and it shuts off automatically when it's out of water. very convenient that way
2,Crane cool mist humidiers,"I have the cow humidifier and just bought the frog today. These humidifiers are great!! I use them in my room (very dry) and they are so quiet and very easy to clean (no filters!!).I had the orange and it was very cute but it did not work right. (kept turning off when it was full)The penguin was really cute also, but it didn't work after about 2 months. (I use them a lot!!)Overall, I love the Crane humidifiers(quiet, easy to clean and inexpensive) and hope this frog I just ordered works as well as the cow does!!"
