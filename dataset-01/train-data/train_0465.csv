4,Love the Mirrors,"We bought these for our 13 month old for christmas. On the good side, he LOVES the mirrors in two of the books and the fun peek-a-boo flaps, but on the down side they are made of plastic and are much smaller than I had anticipated. My son loves to look at them and carries them around so I'm giving them a 4 star."
5,GREAT FIRST BOOKS,I bought these for my Niece so I did not use them personally but they looked great in the packaging and I was glad to see when I got them that they were made of cloth and not paper as I know even those thick paper books don't last long with baby slobber!
5,Sir James Marriott the Lucinda D. slavery in Asia,"a great novel of the western and Oriental mind, of Slavery and ships that sale from Asia . This book is a fast read and the writer brings details and events clearly to your mind. Cruelty and the carrying trade as it was called ..from 1850 to 1861 an inheritance of a life that the hero would not have chosen."
1,this product doesn't do what it's supposed to,"After days of trying to record some old vinyl onto my computer I gave up and called the Griffen. I explained to them that no matter what I tried, the audio signal was getting seriously clipped. They informed me that they are having problems with all of these units and that they are working on a fix...no idea when that fix will be released.They also informed me that they could not provide a cash refund because it was purchased through a third party.hope this helpsbl"
2,output great but input...........,"A great unit as far as the amp is concerned but trying to use this for recording is worthless. I bought this specifically to use with a G4 Mac, rather than the line-in, and it was a mistake. I get better sound with a simple patch cord and the MIC input on the computer. I have tried it on 4 different computers with 4 software packages and all had the same results. The audio via the Powerwave is clipped and distorted no matter what I do."
4,It works for me,I like this thing. It sounds great. Running tiger and have no probs but I use it just to play music on itunes and to record old mix tapes onto the computer. I used to get weird distortion on occasion as well but since I got an iMac G5 its gone. Blue light STINKS! Still great though and cheap.
1,Another bad experience with OS X,"Other people have left detailed reviews; I wanted to add another voice to the growing chorus of ""this product does not work with Mac OS X."" It's completely useless, due to constant distortion of the audio output."
2,uneasy listening,"For anyone curious about discovering the music of Arthur Russell, this is definitely NOT the album to begin your journey. ""Love is Overtaking Me"", for one, would be a much better album for the initiate. ""World of Echo"" is an appropriate title for this collection of ... sounds. I really don't think you could call these normal songs, or even standard musical compositions. The music ebbs and flows, snippets of melody occasionally bursts through the murky mix, but is otherwise buried in the dubs and echoes that abound. This is ... challenging to listen to. While I admire the fact that Arthur Russell was trying to do something different, and ""artistic,"" I have to ask myself: Do I enjoy listening to this album? In all honesty, not much."
3,Important but indulgent,"3 1/2This little known but far reaching release seems to have inspired quite a few since. An avant-garde Drake does seem an appropriate comparison, though Russell's experimental folk drifts as much into the future as it connects into the past. There are many of the artist's signature echo-drenched cello compositions which do tend to become compositionally repetitious and dwindle on a bit at times, but when the minimalist reverb works, WOE truly lives up to it's title. As well as predicting some of the textural work Radiohead would gravitate towards when they wanted to explore electronica, Russell's evocative vocals at times astoundingly parallels one of Rock's most formidable vocalists, My Morning Jacket's Jim James. Few songs sustain a focused purity found in tracks like ""Being It"", and on the contrast reek of awful studio pretentiousness ala ""The Name Of The Next Song"", but the album nonetheless convincingly renders a portrait for this important sound-scaper."
5,Great for someone with poor eyesight,My mom loved to do puzzles when I was a kid (I enjoyed them as well) and I wanted a puzzle that she could do considering her eyesight is failing. The bold colors and large puzzle piece sizes made it extremely easy for her to work with. Highly recommend this item if you're looking for a unique gift for a senior.
1,Very Disappointing !,This is definately not a 2000 book. Coin dates stop at 1984. What a waste of money this book was.
2,Got what I paid for,"Cartridge came in new package, but seal had been removed at some point. After two dozen or so sheets printed it has started smearing all down the page. Will probably have to buy another soon if it continues."
1,We Get It Already... You know whats hip.,"Leland's attempt to document this history of the concept of hip in America is valient, but his thesis is fault at best. He tried to say that every chapter of the history of hip is related...and its not."
5,So Much More Than The Title Implies. You Will Read It Over and Over Again.,I really cannot applaud this book enough. Don't you just love it when you expect mediocre and then you absolutely get blown away? Every single page drips with novelty and insight. Buy it-read it-commit passages to memory.
1,"oh, the Banality!!","to call something one thing and for it to function as the exact opposite, how classically 'trickster' of you John. This book had very few rewarding elements. The steady, lame use of hip-hop slang was so hackneyed it made me wince. Someone tell this guy that Hip-Hop is the most dominant, most pervasive and most corporate form of popular music in history. Mr. Leland evidences scant knowledge of the indie-rock scene, and I couldn't disagree more with his glib conclusions regarding the Beat generation authors. Independent cinema is barely mentioned. This guy is a marvel of philistine co-option. My advice is to not read this book, if you are looking for hipness-as hollow as that sounds- then read Whitman, read Kerouac, read Ginsberg, read Twain or Melville, Dostoyevsky anything but this rediculous foray. At best its kitsch and at worst it meanders off into frivolity."
4,Sun tzu review,"i like the way the book is presented and some concepts explain but i was expecting a bit more of practical explanations on how to apply the knowledge of sun tzu on you life goals, the first part is just a translation of sun tzu and the second part is supposes to show you how to use but the advice is superficial and isn't explain how to exactly apply the knowledge, i still give it a 4 star rating because i enjoy the format of how the book was presented even if i was expecting more of the how to aspect of the book."
3,Chinggis Khan...??? Temujin...?? Genghis Khan...sound familiar?..read on...,"The book gives a general idea of the ""man"", his background, his conquests and the mystery that eludes and shrouds him. The Great Khan is truly mysterious...and with limited historical records, I am greatful that the author has sacrificed time and effort to personally experience, the Mongolian experience, in order to get in touch with the atmosphere and conditons that Genghis may have experienced. These personal accounts sometimes got in my way while reading, I just wanted the author to get on with it... yet at times these personal accounts were justifiable as they helped in clarifying certain points.Overall, I'd say the book was ok... its in my personal book collection... my quest for another book on the Great Khan will not end here..."
2,Not a great book,Read both this book and Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World by Jack Weatherford. John Man spends too much time describing his own travels which was not why I bought the book. Jack Weatherford's book is far more informative and covers not just the life of Genghis Khan but his lasting influence on the world.
2,Not very good (me being polite),"I am a big fan of (popular) history and read quite a lot about it.I remember this book as a huge disappointment:-Lack of historical accuarcy-Lack of deeper understanding of the context of Genghis Khan's rule-Lack of geopolitical contextI was hoping to have the ast bits anwsered in the last part of the book. But all I got was this lame and extremely vague personal travel-stories.If you want a readable and accurate book on the topic, don't buy this one."
3,Chinggis Khan...??? Temujin...?? Genghis Khan...sound familiar?..read on...,"The book gives a general though personal idea of the ""man"", his background, his conquests and the mystery that eludes and shrouds him. The Great Khan is truly mysterious...with minimal historical records to work with..I am greatful that the author has sacrificed time and effort to personally experience, the Mongolian experience, in order to get in touch with the atmosphere and conditons that Genghis may have experienced. These personal accounts sometimes got in my way while reading, I just wanted the author to get on with it... yet at times these personal accounts were justifiable as they helped in clarifying certain points.Overall, I'd say the book was ok... its in my personal book collection..."
1,Misleading title,"i'll just keep it really simple, the first impression is that you'll get to know more of the history and the personality behind these conquests. Unfortunately the author bringing in his own personal experience is not what i really expected or what i was hoping for when i bought the book."
3,"A cocky narration, gone astray","This book is supposed to be an attempt to chronicle the life and times and onward historical march of one of the world's greatest yet most forgotten conquerors and statesmen, by a modern investigator who visits the land of his origins, and tries to trace his clues and history from there onwards. Whereas the author can be said to have succeeded in doing this somewhat, his ""onspot"" attempt at trying to relive Genghis Khan and his times turn into a amateurish, personal travelogue tale, narrated in the typically perky and cocky style of an ordinary, mediocre Britisher that is evoked in such people when they are confronted with something awesome... The resultant declarations and comments on G.K himself and his legacy, together with an assortment of other such comments on present day Mongolia, its culture and people fall far short of what such a book should set out to do, and tend to deviate from the real purpose of such a venture."
5,great shoe-great price,The woman's Ryka shoe was a very good deal. These shoes are always a comfortable shoe for me.
1,Horrible,"do not buy, horrible product. I bought this for my sister and her whole wrist turned black in two days. Item was thrown in the garbage. Do not buy. Warning"
5,What a Great Idea! Should be part of every Family!,"I wasn't sure if my kids, ages 5 and 10, would take to this CD, but what a wonderful surprise! Everyone has their own favorite: the five-year-old especially loves singing Figaro. The ten-year-old's favorite is The Queen of the Night's aria. My favorite is Caro Nome from Rigoletto. The opera synopses themselves aren't suitable for sharing with the kids, but the songs out of context work for all ages. There are also 5 instrumental versions so we pretend we're opera singers. This is great fun, particularly in the car. Their grandparents love it, too!"
1,the violent waldo,"My 4 year old loves Waldo books, and we read them often. However, I would never recommend this one, and it disappeared from his shelves. It seems gratuitously violent in many places. The page The Nasty Nasties bothers me most. It shows vampires, skeletons and bats. The vampires are drinking blood. It's just too gory, and I'd rather not have the pictures ingrained in my son's head. I am not the type of mother who usually complains about this stuff, but since I bought it on Amazon, I thought I might save someone else the purchase."
5,"where's waldo, the fantastic journey",i was pleased with the book and the delivery of the book. my girls were happy and loved the book and want more.
2,"TOO, TOO TINY","While looking into this Waldo book I had read reviews that stated, yes indeed, it's small. However, I wasn't expecting it to be impossible to see. Even using the magnifying glass, along with my reading glasses didn't help at all. I'm fairly certain that the ONLY species who could actually see the tiny print, would be a hawk, or a giant squid since they have amazing eyesight. So unless you are one of those creatures, don't bother buying it unless you want to end up with permanent crossed-eyes, or glaucoma."
2,Small.,"I probably should have read the description of the product better because I was expecting a large hardcover book, but instead, this is a very small hardcover book. Probaby 4x5 inches."
4,Pretty Good,"My daughter and I had played an online game of Where's Waldo, so I bought her this book, she really enjoyed it. ALthough the book is way more difficult than the game."
2,book is too small,"If you are used to the regular size Waldo books, you won't like this one. Go with the regular size version."
2,Where's Waldo? The Fantastic Journey,"Not thrill that the book was a mini book. For over $12.00, I expected a full size. I certainly was not aware that the book was 4"" by 4"". If I was, I would have chosen another."
3,"2 Year Old Loves It, Parents Could Take It Or Leave It","We originally got this book from the library and my 2 year old fell in love. We reluctantly bought it for him because he loved looking at the pictures and reading about brothers (since he has a new baby brother). I agree with the other posts that some of the book's message is odd to say the least. There are certain pages we won't read to our son- like ""Little brother drools but I've got super spit!"", since our 2 year old has a problem with spitting at people when he's frustrated. There also really isn't a ""story""- it's more captions to pictures of brothers playing together."
1,Wrong message for preschoolers,"My boys also received this book free as part of Dolly Parton's program, and I was really disappointed. Parton's program is a wonderful idea and the books we have received previously have quickly become favorites of my boys. However, as a mother of one and three-year-old boys, I am trying to teach them to respect each other and the world around them. Having images in a preschool book such as giving a frog a bath, pulling a dog's tail, and pretending to eat worms is really inappropriate. This is one book that will definitely not make it to our family bookshelf."
1,"Big Brother, Little Brother by Curtis","I gave this book the lowest rating possible because I was very disturbed by some of the photographs and the terrible messages they portray. Specifically the cover photo of two young boys torturing a frog by giving it a soapy bath. As frogs breathe through their skin this experience had to be at least painful if not deadly for the animal. Further into the book two other boys are posed as if they are going to eat live worms. And flip a few more pages to see boys meanly tugging at the tail of a dog. Way to teach kids how to turn a dog into a biter. What on earth was the author thinking when she selected these pictures for a children's book? Apparently she wasn't. For the record, I'm not a vegetarian or a vegan or a member of PETA. These photos were simply very BAD choices to include in any book that would be shared with impressionable children."
1,did not receive this item,"I still would l ike to read this book, but have not received it as yet. This is partially my fault in that I have placed many orders with Amazon and the people who sell thru Amazon recently and our life is not going smoothly due to illness in the family, so I'm having a harder time than usual keeping track of my purchases. This was a big jolt to me to keep better track of my orders. Who do I speak to about not getting this book?"
4,MORE please!,"Living in Ontario, Canada and designing an adobe like home is difficult and we need lots of inspirational books. This one is highly valued in our home during this design period and we recommend this book for anyone in our circumstances. We found it inspirational and useful to our architect who has little exposure to the southwestern style. But...we need more books just like this and find it difficult to buy a book on your site without you providing additional information about the book...for exmample...peeks inside at some of the photographs. That would be so useful. But don't hesitate to order this one; it is well worth the investment."
5,An excellent display of southwest architectural styles.,"Modern Southwest style blends Native American and Spanish cultures as Linda Hunter's Southwest Style artfully displays the architectural styles of the region, blending over two hundred fine color photos with details on accents and decorating style. An excellent display of architectural options in this design."
5,SOUTHWEST GALLORE,"MY HOME IS FILLED WITH SOUTHWEST DECORATING. THIS BOOK NOT ONLY GAVE ME ENJOYMENT, BUT HEPLED ME CONFIRM WHY THIS STYLE IS SO WARM AND ENVITING. IT ALSO GAVE ME NUMEROUS REFRESHING IDEAS IN ADDITION MY OWN DECORATING FLARE BOTH INSIDE AND OUT!"
2,I'd give it a C minus,"Given my passion for the southwest, I expected to love this book, but I didn't. Certainly I found the photos lovely, but somehow the overall package does not convey the excitement, spirituality, and drama of the region. In other words, the book is a little flat. And what I expected to be a good read turned out to be more of an encyclopedia style rundown of facts (in other words, boring). The book comes off as a cold report on what is in fact a fabulously exciting and inspiring region."
2,Pretty but not for everyone,"The book is attractive but not that helpful because it applies to a narrow style category and one region. I agree that one can find southwest style in many parts of the country, but it often doesn't ""move"" well to those locations. As a designer, I see that the colors and materials often do not easily move from the southwest to another region, in part because the natural colors of the landscape and the color of the light itself change when you go to another part of the country. I wish that this book had made that point and helped readers translate the ideas."
1,Do not pay this price!,"I bought this puzzle for my son, but not from this sellar. It is a great puzzle, but not worth more than $10. This sellar is trying to rip you off, just because your son eats, breathes and lives for Lightning McQueen. My advice - go to Walmart and get it for alot less."
2,thyroid balance review,"If you are looking for a book that outlines traditional and alternative methods for treating thyroid disorders, this is NOT the one to buy. In fact, it covers this topic in the last quarter of the book and only in a couple of pages. Mostly covers the endocrine system, symptoms, signs, thyroid drugs, differences between hypo and hyperthyroidism. This information is ok for those who are newly diagnosed and need more information. Does not provide any insightful methods on alternative methods for treatment."
5,Very informative reading,"Was browsing a local used bookstore for another title on thyroid disorders when I ran across this book. I bought it on a whim and am so glad that I did.This book is informative and offers easy-to-understand (but not insultingly easy)explanations of the how the body, and more specifically, the thyroid works. It covers hypo- and hyperthyroidism equally and is presented in a way that makes it easy to skip over the condition that doesn't pertain to you. I was especially thankful for the presentation of alternative treatments and ideas that might be beneficial, as these are so often overlooked in traditional allopathic books.I am presently being treated for Hashimotos by an integrative practitioner who is open and willing to try new things. I can't wait until my next appointment so that I can present this newly learned information to her. After reading this book, I feel such a sense of relief that there are solutions out there to treating hypothyroidism more effectively."
1,Beware of this book!,"I browsed thru this book briefly, but what I did read let me know this book is a lemon. I could mention several points of misinformation in the little that I read, but I will only mention the statement that made my Gravesian eyes pop further out of my head. The last sentence in the segment about the antithyroid medication PTU says, 'Do not take PTU if you are pregnant or nursing.' The authors clearly are not aware that the treatment of choice for pregnant and breastfeeding women is PTU! If they don't know this fact, I would doubt any other information in the book. I wouldn't waste my money on it."
4,A Penetrating Look Into Wellington's Life,"'Wellington: A Personal History,' is a wonderful look at the hero of Waterloo. While at times the narrative tends to quickly move over some points in the Duke's life that could do with a bit more analyzation, (the Duke's Indian and Spanish campaigns,) and perhaps relies a little too heavily on reporting court gossip of the time, 'Wellington' nevertheless is a wonderful introduction to the Duke's life written in an entertaining and easy to read style. Where Hibbert's work really succeeds is in it's portrait of the Duke in his years after Waterloo. The look into the Duke as Prime Minister and confedential advisor to George IV, William IV, and Queen Victoria never fail to hold interest and passages reguarding Wellington with his family and children in general are extremly illuminating. The Duke of Wellngton was indeed one of Britain's greatest figures and Hibbert's biography will testify with a great voice to the truth of that."
3,Good intro to the Duke,"For anyone interested in the personality and political career of the Duke rather than Waterloo itself (which is given short thrift), this is a very good intro. I also found it helpful in seeing how his early India campaigns shaped his image and ideas on warfare without having to wade through a a massive tome. It hits the spot just right, and makes me hungry for more books on Wellington."
3,The Personal Life of the Duke of Wellington - Shorter Edition,"Christopher Hibbert has written a competent, but very brief personal history of the Duke of Wellington. The Duke of Wellington's life could easily fill thousands of volumes, let alone 500 pages. Hibbert has collected some of the more interesting tidbits of the Duke's life to create this brief overview. This isn't a bad book. In general, it is well written, but it is also shallow as a result of the brevity. It's just not enough to grasp how much impact this man had on British and European history from 1805-1851. I was somewhat disappointed. I had hoped for more."
4,A great 'boot' to Wellington!,"A wonderful read! Comprehensive and elaborated. Though I wish Hibbert would give more pages to the Peninsular campaignes. I do very much appreciate the considerable weight that is given to account his marriage i.e. his notorious private life, since it has been a rarely researched domain. One minor inconvenience is that the sense of time eloped between each period seems a little blur.And the great man himself, what a fascinating character! Why, what would you say of a man whose being prime minister is just a tiny fraction of his life."
3,A Satisfactory Introduction,"Hibbert's book, as is typically the case with his work, presents a perfectly satisfactory survey level introduction to the Duke's life and times. His writing is fluid and readable and seldom commits the sins of prolixity or obscurity common in much academic history. The tradeoff, unfortunately seems to be a significant lack of depth or interpretation. The reader familiar with Wellington's career will find little new and is far better served with Lady Longford's two volume work which remains the authoritative piece on the subject. Alternatively, Phillip Guedalla's 1931 biography is still available through out of print searches or otherwise and provides a compromise between length and detail."
2,"Boring, too much irrelevant personal gossip","I was dissappointed with this book. I guess the title says it all, the author focuses too much on minor aspects of the life of Wellington."
1,What a snooze-inducer!,"Having just finished McCullough's John Adams, I picked this up, hoping for another wonderfully vivid portrait of a great historical figure. Instead I find a book so crammed with useless details, so choked with irrelevant facts about irrelevant characters in Wellington's life, as to be virtually unreadable. I have no objection to a high level of detail, when properly employed in the advancement of a good narrative. But I can't explain the purpose of the useless details in this book, unless to parade before us the author's exhaustive knowledge.I fall asleep each night after reading one and a half pages. If you're an insomniac with no real interest in Wellington, this book is for you. Otherwise, don't waste your time."
5,Sleek and Awesome,I bought this as an indestructible replacement for the glass jar my Oster blender came with because I was pretty clumsy with the jar of the old blender. I was afraid I would break the glass one. This product is awesome - it looks incredible sitting atop the polished stainless base of the Oster stainless beehive blender I purchased. Gives a very modern look to the classic lines of the beehive.
4,Good so far,"I've had these now for a few weeks - so far, so good. Only negative comment is that the lid is a bit flimsy. The center cap that doubles as a measuring cup doesn't lock snug in the black rim - and black rim doen't lock snug into the jar, so I've been holding while blending...not sure if it would work fine w/o holding - don't want to risk a massive cleanup. my existing bottom cap and blade fit snug, so no issues there. All in all, it's well worth the money."
4,Nice set for smaller doors,"I own many sets of Woodline bits. This set is very good for smaller doors.The quality of bits are good, there are better brands but those brands cost significantly more than Woodline. For a hobbyists these will perform fine.Woodline does have a lifetime warranty on their bits as well."
3,very helpful,I had seen a jacket someone made from a sweatshirt and I loved and thought I could do that. So I looked at several books and chose this one because it best fit my needs. I am very pleased with the book and am getting ready to do one of the projects (jacket) in the book. Quite worth the money.
1,It's my party...........,".......and I'll whine if I want to, pity me if I want to, opine if I want to, pity me if I want to. Are we all in the Leslie Gore rhythm yet? This is one book that was a real struggle to read. It was if I wanted to yell at the author ""Enough, already"". I couldn't find anything about the main character to connect to and there was no depth to the rest of the characters. When I got to the end of the book, all I could think was ""what a waste of time"". Sorry......."
1,$32 for a Kindle Book published in 2007?,"OK -- I am sure that this book provides a fine historical account of the Hoplites but at $32 for a Kindle download, I will never know. I would caution Amazon that one of the (maybe the best) virtues of the Kindle is the affordability of its selection of books, new or old. If we are to see more books come in at prices greater than a paperback price (to $15) then the Kindle goes into the bedside table drawer."
2,Stupidity As Virtue,"Mr. Hanson seems to feel there's some particular moral virtue in a style of war where the height of strategy is to put your head down and run at the enemy like a bull at a gate. And that nothing is necessary but righteous enthusiasm.As the son, grandson and great-grandson of professional soldiers -- mostly in the service of the British Empire -- words cannot express my disdain. My ancestors spent their professional lives butchering just such patriotic agrarian amateurs like sheep.As the poet put it:""The 'eathen in 'is blindness Bows down to wood and stone; 'E won't obey no orders Unless they is 'is own -- 'E keeps 'is side-arms sloppy 'E leaves 'em all about. Then up comes the Regiment; An' we punch the 'eathen out!"""
4,Come and See,Just getting ready to start this bible study so wont really have any input till after that...although I have perusedthe book and find it interesting..Jan
5,it really is SO EASY,"I toyed with the idea of making homemade baby food, and then I met the creator of this product at a seminar and she convinced me to give it a try. There are so many benefits to doing it -- from greater nutrition to greater variety to saving money. Not to mention modeling your baby's palatte to include fresh and healthy foods as opposed to the processed taste of bottled baby foods.The book and DVD are super helpful and the system couldn't be easier. You are given instructions on how to pick out the given produce item at the market, how much to buy to create the number of servings, how to store it, how to cook it, and various ways to serve it to your baby at different stages. You will be amazed -- you will be licking the spoon after you scoop it into the provided trays. Speaking of which, I love that they are made in the USA with all the scary things you read about products made in China these days.Definitely give it a try."
5,Making baby food is so easy with this!,"I knew making food wouldn't be that hard, but I needed something to help me. Having a baby takes up enough time, I don't have a lot of extra time. This is so easy and quick! If you want healthy, homemade food for your baby, buy this. The recipes are easy and it comes with the food trays. You won't be disappointed.I haven't used this part yet, but there is a memory section about food (like 1st birthday, etc.) and each new food has a journal part to it to record when you fed your baby the food and what their reaction was."
3,DVD was missing,The DVD was missing so I had to contact baby fresh company and they sent me the DVD extra. Well the DVD is kinda useless in my eyes when u are able to read the book. I was hoping for more demonstrations of first aid in case of choking instead.I am a little disappointed because the company wants to encourage healthy eating habits but recommends cooking and reheating in a microwave which kills pretty much all the nutritions in food. I am steaming instead. The Book is very Good though as far as recipes and instructions but I give the whole kit only 3 points because I think they are missing the point with their microwave procedure.
3,A little to much microwave,"While I love the food trays, mine got stained from carrots the first time I used them. If you are looking for a baby food cookbook, keep looking! This one has you microwave EVERYTHING, while it is easy I'm not sure that is the best method for cooking baby food for retaining nutritional value. The mix-ins suggestions are good, but there is probably a better baby food cookbook out there. Not unhappy with the purchase, but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
3,Good quick start guide for newbies,"This kit came with a good basic cookbook, two trays & covers, and a DVD. The book itself is a good starting place but doesn't cover all of the bases (e.g. organic, vegetarian) completely. The two authors are not dietitians or doctors. We also purchased The Petit Appetit Cookbook with this and it was a nice complement.The trays are great and we use them constantly.As others have noted, the DVD is pretty worthless unless you've never cooked. If you don't cook anyway, then I can't imagine that you're going to make your own baby food but if that is the case then the DVD might be helpful.I don't know that I'd buy this kit again but if you're excited about making your own baby food but are a little intimidated this kit would be a good place to start."
2,Microwave Really????,The authors recommend that you microwave all the food you cook for your baby. Is this a joke? Coming from a company that is based on feeding children natural food you would think they would want to cook it in a more natural manner. I don't even own a microwave and definitely don't plan on cooking 100% of my baby's food in one. They do have about 4 sentences in their 100 page cookbook that relates to steaming food but it looks like it was added as an afterthought.Also the book and DVD are written with a 12 year old in mind as their audience. They could give their customer a little more respect and act like they have at least half a brain.The trays are nice and I plan on making my baby food using the cook book but you have to be a little curious about a natural baby food product that encourages everything to be cooked in a totally unnatural manner.
3,OK,"The book is ok. It isn't layed out very well so there is a bit of redundancy, leaving you to hunt for the info. you really want like the recipes. The trays are great, just a bit too small. I end up using two squares per feeding since they don't seem to be a full ounce. I haven't watched the DVD. Not disappointed I bought it, just wished for a bit more."
2,problems with the Lithium ion battery,"I have now owned this watch for one year. Right out of the box the promised ""months"" before it would go into the ""sleep"" or ""hibernation"" mode was only one week. I read on blog sites it takes 25,000 wrist movements to fully charge the new Lithium-ion battery. Previously SEIKO had used ""super capacitors"" made by Panasonic, but now discontinued because of leakage issues. If you do not wear the watch daily, with the above 25,00 required movements, good luck that it will EVER be fully charged. Result, premature 'death' of the battery. I read on blog sites that the new Li-ion batteries will last maybe only 5 - 6 years. So much for a maintenance free watch! Note, the cost of having the battery replaced is > $100.-Another observation: the watch is difficult to read under certain low light conditions. All ""bling"", you cannot make out the hands. I have taken to glance at my wife's watch in such cases."
3,"They do a great job, but waaaayyyy overpriced.","I bought a 50 pack of these from the huge department store chain for less than 3 dollars. I compared the two, and they are almost identical. These are a little larger, by about 1/2"" per side. The others are a bit wetter, which is actually a bit of a nuisance. Other than that, they are identical.These are just great for cleaning lenses. They are alcohol based, so they clean aggressively and leave no film if used properly. By that I mean that you have to wipe your lens, then let the cloth evaporate a bit, and go back over the lens to remove any streaks. Be sure to blow off or brush off your lens before using these or any other cloth for that matter.I now carry a bunch of these (the cheap ones) in my camera bag, replacing a bottle of lens cleaner and a cloth, and use them to clean off everything from my lenses to my sunglasses and phone."
1,Always Held Zeiss At The Highest Level Of Quality Until This Product.,This is one of the worst products I have ever used for multi coated optics and you better be real quick about getting the film off multi-coated optics before it dries.Simply a beautifully packaged product that may ruin your finest lenses but works well on a D 700 LCD panel . I am being gentle here - being a D3s - D 700 - EOS 1V guy - I speak from experience.DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT ON MULTI COATED LENSES OR B&W; MRC FILTERS.
1,Don't do the job.,"This simply do not clean ones glasses; they leave a lot of streaking and dried something behind; utterly pointless, and the fact that the individual packets have to be ripped of off each other is annoying.I swore by Sight Savers till they recently changed their formulation to be like Zeiss', and am now desperately searching for a replacement. :("
3,Great porcelain surface but... bad packaging,Great smooth surface which works well with the refillable Pilot BeGreen refillable markers that I have (also checkout the Staedtler refillable markers). The only problem is that there is a very thin cardboard layer (& of course an air gap) between the packing box and the board surface. The board I had ordered (as a gift) had a dent it had received during shipping (or packing?) which had cracked the porcelain surface. A sheet of styrofoam would have definitely saved the board from that dent. The packaging does have good corner protection but leaves the main writing surface completely vulnerable. I unfortunately didn't have the time to going through the whole replacement process since the board needs to be used immediately. Please get this fixed Quartet!!
3,Good Mascara!,"I bought this mascara last month because I wanted to try bobbi brown makeup and I needed a great new mascara. I am a huge mascara girl so if you are two, this is what I can say: If you're looking for something to make your lashes huge, bold, volumous, this really isn't it. If you're looking for something to lengthen and define your eyelashes, this is it. The outcome is a nice clean look, hope it helps!"
3,Where's Conrad Anker,"This is a public domain book, purchased for the comments of Conrad Anker -- but there was NO forward by Anker!"
3,good but a little bitter,"I bought this after the tea craze brought about by a Dr. Oz interview. This was wok. Mixed it with herbal flavored tea and it was drinkable. I'm not supposed to have caffeine so I did not get into the recommended tea ""dosage"" but I did notice that it reduced my appetite. I bought some more at a local store (Numi Emperor's Pu-erh) to save on shipping and it is a little less ""distinctive"", although I don't know if that is because the tea is less pure or strong though."
1,Run Away. Very Fast.,"Quite possibly the most disgusting thing about this book is the back cover's attempt to use this as a way to ""sell"" Hamlet to young readers. While it's true that Shakespeare's tragedies are very bloody, they are also filled with psychological complexity which this homophobic garbage has utterly jettisoned. And of course, the author has made sure to turn the initially nerdish Prince of Denmark into Everybody's All-American football hero. Just avoid it, and the rest of the forthcoming ""Bard's Blood"" series."
5,Ophelia's Revenge,"David Bergantino is a brilliant writer. I have been a fan of his work for many years now and I must say it just keeps getting better...All I have to say is ""Keep on writing, elder!"""
4,This book is for all ages,"I was pleasantly surprised to get so much benefit from this book even though I am definitely not old! (49!) The book helped me to realize that old age is definitely ""mental"" and the book gives good, reasonable advice for being happy and healthy at any age. This would be a great book for anyone who is learning to deal with aging parents or friends."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed in this book. The title is promising, however, the content is sophomoric - a rather juvenile style of writing. This is basically a woman's journal entries, chronicling her personal growth through her reading experiences. Her reading material is dated; there are many newer and finer sources for personal growth opportunties. Her frequent comments of, ""you might not be interested in this but, . . . "" are tedious. Her frequent pauses to listen to a tape and then writing, ""I'm back . . . "" are irritating. I don't know how the editor let her get away with her repetitious non-information. Wait, yes, I do. The reason this book was published is the gimmick of a ninety-year-old woman writing her memoirs. Given all that, if you need a reading list for personal growth and enjoy the ramblings of a woman who is constantly working on personal growth, then this book may be for you."
3,Wrong Information,"I ordered this phone based on a number of its features. Unfortunately one of the most important for me was the Caller ID/CW. The phone does not have this feature. I contacted Vtech myself after receiving the phone to verify, and I am correct. Do not order this phone if you want that specific feature. I really can not rate the rest of the phone."
4,4 line wonder,"While one reviewer was unhappy line identifier was not automatically supplied, (this is of course a line supplier item not a phone supplier item only.)the phone itself has large easily used buttons, with easy to see at a glance red indicator lights. It does every thing the instructions cover, you can even program a time delay before the second line rings. It works well with other phones on our line (which were A T & T )- While we rated it a 4 star it is really a four star plus - oh and it also accepts headphone operation, something most other phones in this area do not."
5,GREAT!!,"I have a bad neck and I bought this product to strengthen it improve my range of motion and eliminate neck pain. I can tell the difference after one day. I already have more range of motion, less pain (no more cracking!) and my neck muscles even feel denser. It's very convenient; no need to attach weights, quick and easy velcroe adjustment and it allows for resistance on all neck movements. It's also comfortable, though I usually have to take it off and let my scalp breathe after 15-20 minutes. Although, I imagine it's much better than those other neck strengtheners that require weights and could double as midieval tourture devices or bondage equipment."
5,Great way to strengthen your neck and prevent concussions,Super fast delivery. There are not many ways to strengthen your neck. This product does just that. Very easy to use. You can feel the difference after only a few uses. Excellent way to strengthen your neck and prevent concussions.
3,Not heavy enough,"From other reviews I thought that 8lbs would be enough to give my neck a workout. However I could wear this for an hour without feeling much of anything, even while doing head rotations. It does help my posture as I can feel when my head is not straight up (weight moves to the side I'm leaning to). It is comfortable and well padded, though but I do need to give my head a few seconds' break ever 15mins or so, as it cuts off blood to the skin (feels itchy)."
1,Techko S184 Portable Door Knob Guard with Vibration Sensor,Bought two of these alarms only one worked. The 9 volt battery was dead after using the alarm for one week.
1,unusable!,"Very disappointing - this door alarm is waaaaay too sensitive. It will go off for no apparent reason, and there is no way to adjust the sensitivity. It is very loud but there's no way you could turn it on and then go to sleep or leave the house. It would go off and wake you up or go off and disturb the neighbors. Please don't spend your money on this product! I gave it one star because that was the lowest rating I could give - it really deserves zero stars."
2,Can't disarm without LOUD EAR-PERCING CHILD AWAKENING noise,"It works, but it is sensitive. Half the time you can't turn it off without waking up the neighborhood. I tried to cautiously hold down the unit when turning it off. It is possible to quietly disarm, but it is hard. Imagine one of those movies where the guy is trying to disarm a bomb without blowing himself up and everyone around him. THAT is the kind of sensitivity it takes to turn the thing off. Purchase only if you have patience, don't have kids, and you are halfway deaf."
5,Very sensitive,"This is a great product, very sensitive. Unfortunately it is too sensitive for me, since i live in an appartment complex, and even my my neighbour slams their door, this thing goes off. But other than that, I think its the bext product out there for someone who is not in an appartment building. Oh yeah, its VERY louod too."
3,SECURITY DOOR KNOB GUARD,"It is made with cheap plastic, however, the sound is very loud and effective. For something that just hangs on my door knob and is used as a deterant or just to give me plenty of time to get my weapon, I am glad I purchased it."
2,"Nice when it works, but erratic","This is a basic door knob alarm. The idea is that you hang it over the inside of a door and when the door opens, the vibration sensor will set off the alarm. The alarm has two settings - an incredibly loud wail to scare away intruders and wake sleeping residents and a quieter but still reasonably loud chime to announce that the door has been opened. (The second alarm is about as loud as a loud doorbell).We got this for our toddler's room, in order to alert us when she got out of bed. After a few weeks, we took it off. When it worked, it was fine, but about 50% of the time, she opened the door gently enough that the alarm didn't go off. If it was a little more sensitive, it would have been great for us, and it would probably be fine for a ""sticky"" door that can't be opened smoothly, like a weatherstripped exterior door."
1,"Cheaply made, sometimes works","I had to throw this away after trying it. It looks good in the photo but it is flimsy and unreliable. Sometimes it would work when moved; other times you could slam the door and even shake the alarm and it would still be silent. So if it can't be counted on to work every time someone opens the door, it can't be counted on at all, right? Don't waste your money on this one."
5,1st Birthday Gift Hit!,"I bought this book for my second child, for his first birthday. I figured it would be a hit with him since his first noises were those of dinosaur roars due to his older brother being obsessed with the creatures and constantly walking about the house roaring himself. I had original (for my first son) bought this publishers animal book and it was such a hit with him that it feel apart and had to be re-purchased. Lets just say that this one is not far behind. It's not quite as good as the animal book in that it doesn't have a ton of dinosaurs in it like the animal book does, but the boys love it and often times sharing has been difficult. It's hard not to be a hit though with the t-rex being on the first page...causing quite a stir at the very beginning between the two of them roaring and stomping about."
5,hard to hit,hard to hit is one of tightest cd to me and my partnaz. the beats are big and hardcore. the lyrics are complex and quicc. It's a shame the real don't get props as a lot of succaz. big mike has grownup lyrics but stay true to the streets at the same time stay'n true to himself. one of the trillest tapes i've heard in a long time. the whole tape is a hit. i would tell you all the cut but i don't have it. when i go to get it i will be my third copy. and when i lose that or get beat for it i will get it again.
1,Without A Hit,"The hardest hit on here is track 15 ""How You Want It"" featuring Outlawz & Grudge. Admittingly I've heard better from the ex Geto Boys member on his first solo Somethin' Serious. I use this to let it beat in my trunk. I hate to be so down on Big Mike, but some of the production seems unfinished and or too much like they were being rushed. His lyrics come to the rescue with ""Heads Like Us"" and ""Better Now"" featuring Devin & MC Breed. Enough playing get that Big Mike Somethin' Serious, because it is."
2,the implosion of big mike,"A bad album of Big Mike proportions. Generic Ronco beats with a very sloppy Big Mike trying in vain to keep up. I give it an extra star for the comedic effect. I could say its a shame because he used to be great, blah blah blah. Sell out or wash out, the results are the same. Chin the pole Mikey."
4,Bestop 29226-15 seat covers,Got these to replace crappy Smittybuilt neoprenes. So far so good. Heavy duty. Will have to see how they are when summer comes and the top comes down. Could get hot when the sun shines on em. They are more vinyl than the spongy neoprenes. Will report back.
5,fantastic 4 still alive,The fantastic 4 is one of favorite comics and i am glad to own this series that only lasted a short time.Now i can watch it anytime i like. I prefer this 1994-1995 series over the new one.that is on television now THANK YOU TO THE SELLER !!! i got good customer service and i am very happy with my buy as always!!!
2,Fantastic Four (1994),Fantastic Four (1994) set is vary poor show.get the 1967 Fantastic Four set if it ever comes out. much much better show.
2,Fantastic Four The Complete Animated Series,"I've been waiting for the 60's version of the Fantastic Four. I was quite disappointed to see that the 67 Spiderman got released on DVD and not the original Fantastic Four. This series has to be the best, and since it aired on Cartoon Network a few years back, I would think that it would be released soon afterwards on DVD. I still stalk the shelves at all stores in hopes of finding it on DVD. I don't care what the price is, I'm going to buy it to savor for years to come. So whoever decides what or when to release a vintage cartoon on DVD I'm hoping that The Fantastic Four 1960's original version is on the horizon and soon."
1,"Blah, 60's FF best","Like Star Trek , the 60's version of this show was the best. More action, better stories.Marvel should release the oldest first then work thier way up to the more current disappointments, and don't even both with the HERBIE era of stupidity !Can't wait for 60's FF, and 60's Space Ghost. A time when superheros were really SUPER !"
2,Not the cartoon series I wanted,"For one thing, I didn't know there was a 90's version of the Fantastic Four cartoon series. This is not the one I wanted when I ordered this a a few months ago. I am now finally able to see it and low and behold, I am disappointed. I expected the original cartoon series which is still shown on tv today, not this modernized version. I don't mean to sound too critical but I am not into these modernized, newer versions of these classic cartoons. The batman, superman, justice league, etc. are not the ones I grew up on. I watched a few minutes of a few of the Fantastic Four episodes and I am not too thrilled. They are ok, so I guess I may have to watch them more so they can grow on me, but I am really waiting for the old Fantastic Four cartoon to come out on DVD. Anyone know if and when that will happen?"
4,The 4 is fantastic,"I got this for the kids because I remember watching it as a kids and enjoying it plus I love super heros and grow up with comic book. At first I was disappointed when I watched the 1 cd as it was different from what I remembered and was an older version and was slower pace and it didn't keep the kids attention but as we continued to watch, it got a more interesting and I began to see the more newer version. There are a lot of cartoons to watch. I had hoped to see more bonus features but it is not needed, you have so many shows to watch and the kids also enjoyed it."
3,Not quite fantastic,"Mainly put together and released as part of a marketing ploy to coincide with the release of the big budget movie this summer, this box set of the Fantastic Four animated series that ran during the mid-90's has it's share of good and bad. The first few episodes of the first season are what makes up the bad part of this box set, featuring some choppy animation, laughable dialogue, and some cheesy storytelling. When the series got re-tooled, it took off and was far more reminiscent of the classic comic stories from various runs by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, John Byrne, and such. There are guest heroes and villains galore, including the Puppet Master, the Silver Surfer, Thor, the Hulk, Daredevil, and even Ghost Rider. This box set is worth owning for die hard FF fans, but it may be a bit too pricy for some. Hopefully with the release of this box set, maybe season box sets of Fox's X-Men animated series from the 90's will be released as well."
2,Fantastic Four poor animation,I bought this set sight unseen and wish I had seen it so I knew not to buy it. I never saw this series on TV and was surprised this poorly animated series ever got on TV.The dialogue doesnt match the lips of the characters half the time. Dr. Doom looks like a mechanical elf with 4 teeth. The most annoying character is the Fantastic Four's landlady who threatens to throw them out every episode. She made me want to shut off my TV.Kudos to Chuck McCann who voices The Thing and keeps things half way interesting. Some may enjoy it but I say rent it first and see if you like it before investing in buying it.
1,We want the 1960s Fantastic Four series,"I believe that the 1960s Fantastic Four series from Hanna-Barbera is far better than the 1990s series, and I strongly recommened releasing the whole series on DVD. I am sure it will sell very well.Thank you."
3,More of a One-Time Use Product,"This works really well for patching up holes in wetsuits and other neoprene products. The only complaint is that you really can't use it for long. The top half of the tube hardened after a few uses, so I lost the ability to use most of the stuff inside the tube. I got maybe five small uses out of this product.If they can make it so that the stuff inside doesn't harden, that would make this product a definite 5-star product."
1,Perhaps it works,Maybe it works but I wouldn't know. What is pictured and described was not what I received.I ordered wetsuit repair and got a repair set for fishing waders. The density and flexibility of the glue doesn't match wetsuits so it didn't serve my purpose.The shipper said that's all they had when i voiced my dissatisfaction with receiving something different to what was pictured. Wasn't a good purchase for me......unless i decide to invest in a pair of damaged waders.
4,Heroes Unlimited II,"Great both for a stand alone Supers Game, and wonderful as an addition for most other Palladium games. DM's running RIFTS will find it useful when your players are running rampant over the Techno based and Magic based NPC's. Adds spice to your Horror based games. No more seeing the players stake and cross your vampires when they have INVULNERABILITY."
5,Taking what was great and making it better!,"This is a must have book for any Gamer. The second edition of the great and popular Heroes Unlimited has been a long time coming! It takes you to new extremes. If you can think it up, there is a way to make it within this book. You can go from a secret agent trying to stop the end of the world, to a Super Hero saving the day. Good or bad, they are all the same in the end. The system is easy to follow, and anyone who liked the first edition will love the changes. This one has a bit more power to it, but that's where the fun lies. Get this book, plus the weapons and equipment guide, and you are set to do what ever you need to, in order to save the world, or take it over!"
4,Great Book,This book was REALLY GREAT the only real down fall was the lack of selection for equipment. Namely the weapons other then that excellent book!!!
4,Excellent superpowered RPG,"Heroes Unlimited uses a range of character types (secret agents, martial-arts-masters, as well as super-powered superhumans). It covers all aspects of character generation, but has only a small list of equipment. It allows characters to be used in other Palladium games (Rifts, Fantasy, Ninjas-and-Superspies etc), or to be used in their own contemporary setting. Not as difficult as some RPGs to learn but requires the purchase of additional books to be of real use."
3,You better have your order correct,"the product looks sturdy, but the customer service is horrible. i called to make sure i got the correct item and i was assured that what they recommended was the correct product. when i recieved it, it was wrong. now they want me to pay yet again for shipping to get the item back to them and to exchange it, pay shipping again. this is ridiculous. i will never order from them again. after shipping back to them it's as if i payed for the item as a whole and actually kept it."
3,Power+ replacement batteries,It has been going on to close to two weeks since I received word that a replacement battery would be sent out. The originals came within a few days but now the replacements are no where in sight. Either failure to ship or forgotten. Either case will remember the Pwr+ plus people when ordering from Amazon. The Battery Geeks were quicker to response all around.So now I know better.
3,Replacement battery,"The battery weighs about 12 ounces versus about 16 ounces for my old OEM batteries. At first it did not charge in the Makita charger but I found that if it was not pushed all the way down in the seat of the charger, then the charge light comes on. It works fine, but the lighter weight indicates less storage capacity than a new OEM battery, but at about half the OEM price, I think it is an OK replacement - especially if it is used for back up."
2,not makita,my drill wouldn't work with it installed . i sent it to makita to be repaired. they tested the battery and found it was substandard . . .i'm going to ask for my money back . . .
1,These suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I got 2 of these in April and they will not hold a charge. Do not last 1/2 as long as a Makita battery when used right after charging and are worthless a week later. Stay away as these are junk. Looking for waranty info as I will return if I can and if not they will be recycled. Total Junk!!!!!
1,misrepresented,"This battery is represented as a equivalent replacement for a Makita 9033. This is NOT TRUE, the Makita 9033 has a capacity of 2200 mah, this battery is 1500mah, a big difference and a gross misrepresentation.Also it is way overpriced."
3,Makita replacement battery review,"I purchased the Makita replacement battery for my cordless screw driver and it worked like new for the first six months. Since then, the work life started decreasing and I now have to charge it constantly. It works about as well as my original battery which is over ten years old."
4,Good value..,"This was the third battery replacement for my trusty old Makita drill/driver.The first 2 were original Makita.I ordered this no name brand as it was much more reasonably priced comparing with Makita battery.It arrived timely, I charged it, and have used it a couple of times for small jobs. It feels it has good torque, and still holding good juice after sitting in the drawer for about a month without recharge.I gave it four star because I can't tell its longer term performance."
4,Battery,"A bit pricey for a generic replacement battery, but works great. Fits perfectly, takes a full charge and holds it."
4,Its a battery,It worked.!! I need to get a few more though because I'm always running out of power right in the middle of a job. Not the batteries fault it would help to have more than 1. The least expensive I found at a store was $39.99 and I don't think they would work any better.
4,Makita replacement 9.6v drill battery,I found the replacement 9.6V(older style 9000 series) battery to be the equal of the original. I have only used it for several weeks but have found it holds it's charge as well as the OEM units.
5,PWR+ 9.6V Makita relacement battery,Received this as expected and put it in the charger. It charged up overnight so I plugged it in to the saw. I did about four hours of work with the saw a week later and it performed flawlessly. It still has enough charge to work another four hours from the way it sounds. Now that I have two batteries I feel comfortable with the tool. I bought a bunch of replacement blades so I am set for a few years.
5,"Strong reliable battery, quick charge, long lasting.","This replacement battery takes a quick charge, is long lasting, and has a very deep cycle....meaning it has the ability tosustain ongoing power over extended use. So far it has been superior to the original battery that came with my Makitapower drill."
4,lots of action to satisfy the martial arts enthusiast.,"jeff wincott's martial arts skill was displayed throughout the movie, his character's attitude towards non-violent confrontation soon diminished as the movie moved along and all in all this was worth watching all the way through."
2,Not really standardized Hawthorn,"This Nature's Way product like others says it's standardized but when you get it, and look at its ingredients, only 300mg of it is standardized and the other 200mg of Hawthorn isn't. This is a very deceitful practice and I'm finding that this is a common problem with so called standardized anything."
1,Rerview Mirror,"Was really disappointed with this album. He needs to find something new that has the zip of Vincent, Crying & American Pie. Old artists may need to just fade away if they are just a bunch of old men strumming boring new stuff. Bought this album because of the 3 songs that I mentioned. None of the rest made me want to listen more than once."
3,Mixed feelings,"reading this book was like reading underwater; everything seemed rather slow, dulled, monotone, yet I was curious to see how events would unfold. It is a good book to read if you have just read a rather taxing one and need a ""restful"" read with a somewhat interesting story."
3,Which are better: French or American?,"Okay, I may be only 17 here, but I read the book. It's interesting, I'll give it that, but it was also kind of slow. Dianne Johnson, though, gave explanations that were vivid to the imagination. I found this book a little disappointing in that I had really expected something funnier and more up-beat than what was really there. On the whole, though, it's worthwhile to read."
3,The Ending Not Written,"As an American living in Paris I enjoyed Diane Johnson's quick and witty insites into the problems of cultural assimilation. Many of her characterizations were dead-on funny. However, I can only guess that the author got tired of writing half way through because she submits the reader to an inappropriate, totally confusing and completely inadequate ending. It is such a disappointing ending that I would almost recommend not reading the book at all..."
3,It helps if you have been to Paris,"During a recent visit to Paris, I found this book in the apartment we had leased. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book in its setting, recognizing the sites and some phrases. I'm not certain that I would have felt the same way if I had not visited Paris. The Disneyland drama seemed contrived and I was disappointed by the book's abrupt conclusion. Also, what was Roxy's reaction when Saint Ursula was sold when she assumed otherwise?"
4,Asks the question: Can an American ever be anything else?,"Le Divorce does an excellent job of showing the complexities involved with being an American who wishes to live and integrate into the culture of another country. As a young American woman with a desire to live in Europe, I highly identified with the questions Diane Johnson raised about inherent American-ness. This book asks the question--Can an American ever be anything else? And more broadly--Are we forever a product of the culture we were raised in? She really focuses on this theme despite her somewhat wacky and unrealistic plot. It is her analysis of Americans in Paris that makes this book interesting. Additionally, I enjoyed the intro. quotes at the beginning of each chapter--In this book they really fit and keep the intellectual tone strong. Couldn't she have translated the French?"
2,Paris as a setting for a common story,"I am French and I have been living in Paris for 6 years, so I was very interested in reading this story about Americans discovering a bit of Paris. I must say this is nice to read about places you know, about features showing the writer actually was in Paris quite recently. I was a little disappointed to see that most of the extraordinary things to the main character may not sound fabulous to an American not coming from Santa Barbara, a quite protected area. So I had this growing impression of reading more and more cliches as I went on in the book. It is a quick and easy book to read on vacation. At some point, the main character gets bored and I did too and I was not in a better mood when I read the unrealistic end. The french setting is not enough."
2,Had potential but was trite,"This book was such a disappointment! I actually re-read it to make sure I didn't miss anything, since I had heard such good things about it from friends and reviews, and was disappointed twice. I have spent considerable time in Paris and enjoyed Johnson's observations of French culture, especially concerning the subtleties of family interactions, gender roles and double standards that exist. These insights however were the highlight of the book - the plot was unbelievable and the American characters were one-dimensional stereotypes. Johnson's new book, Le Mariage has an unbelievably charitable review in the New Yorker this week - they hint that it is not as good as Le Divorce, so I won't even try! If I had known it was this easy to write books about Americans in Paris and get published with such success, I would have done it the first time I went to Paris, when I was 16."
2,I must have missed something...,"It's always difficult for me to enjoy a book if I get the feeling that I wouldn't like the main characters if I knew them in real life, and that's exactly how I felt about ""Le Divorce..."" I bought it last year but could never read more than a few pages at a time, but then with the movie coming out, I figured I should try again. The descriptions of Paris and the changing of the seasons were wonderfully done, but the characters left me completely cold. The two sisters never took any steps on their own behalf-- they let situations control them in the most irritating fashion without ever becoming proactive. I'm curious to see if the movie rounds out the characters of the two women, or leaves them as flat and featureless as Diane Johnson did. With any luck, it will be one of those few times a movie was better than the book on which it was based."
3,Pisses me off!,"This is a decently-written, interesting observation of social THOUGHT. I'm annoyed, however, that Isabel is such a twit- I know she's young, but she misses really obvious statements- sometimes she understands French & at others she doesn't, conveniently for the novelist. I suppose I am angry because I am at p. 270 and she has not acted with integrity or minimal foresight, which I expect from a character I'm intended to identify with. I don't need her to be perfect, but 1) absolutely, she needed to mention to Mrs. Pace the tureen photo, & at the point of the robbery, the over-interest of her compratiate. Especially after the (overt) scene in the bookstore. Yes, spoiled- Isabelle, Roxy, Suzanne, Edgar.. spoiled & selfish. Still a good read, but I'm pissed anyway. Which probably means it's a good book, since I'm engaged enough to write this review."
2,"Kinda Stiff, in a Pompous Sort of Way","This story is told in first person, but the first person is a little stiff.Maybe she's supposed to come across as a cold-hearted, unemotional, spoiled young woman,but that doesn't mean that all the other characters should as well. I didn't like any ofthe underdeveloped characters enough to care what happened to them. It wasn't all that funny, either.Perhaps if you spoke French or knew Paris, you might appreciate it more, as thereare a bazillion references to Parisian locales and menu items.If there is something really redeeming about it, I guess I missed what it was.This doesn't stop me however, from wondering how the movie will turn out."
2,Meh,"A short review because I basically agree with the other reviewers' opinions. My trouble is that I actually really like Diane Johnson's writing: I like her use of language and I like her funny observations that are so very human and familiar. What I cannot stand, and in this book particularly, is that the plot is so dull, the plot points seem almost arbitrarily thrown in, and that the climax and resolution to the story are so tepid as to be almost non-existent.I have tried two of her books and I will not be trying a third."
4,Franco-American Relations,"I loved this story. Of course, I lived in Paris, and I'm an American married to a French woman. But I think Ms. Johnson hit the nail on the head many times when she described Parisian lifestyles, Californian lifestyles, and how those two lifestyles often clash when brought face to face (and body to body, in the case of Oncle Edgar).The fate of the painting was a perfect deus ex machina to bring out the cultural issues that arise when two families from different countries become joined through a marriage. The author's knowledge of Paris, French life, and even French law was impressive and accurate. She did her homework.There are many truths contained in this novel, and for that reason alone one might consider curling up on a couch one cold night and jumping in. That and the sumptuously described characters and settings that fill up the story. You will not be disappointed."
3,A High Brow and Witty Novel,"I enjoy transatlantic novels and this is a good one. It is satire at its best. It offers witty observations about both the French and Americans -- the comparisons are often laugh out loud hilarious.The characters were great and I enjoyed the social commentary they provided us. I recommend this book for anyone who is interested in French culture, living abroad, or in the need of a good read!"
3,"Good book, but not great","It is hard to give a review of a book like this because it doesn't inspire or repel you. It was nice reading, good story, and very funny at times. But it lacked an overall cohesion and the characters (even Isabel) were not developed much past their introduction. At the end of the story, you don't really even care about what happens to anyone. However, it is an unpretentious novel without being trashy and would probably be a good book for a plane."
1,A waste of time,"If you're French and homesick, or interested in the ""real"" France, stay away from this book. Every page is full of French words and sentences which the author doesn't deign to translate; even more annoying is the fact that these French phrases are full of spelling and grammar mistakes... If you want to show off, at least get it right! I am French, living in the States, and I have yet to find a cruder collection of stereotypes about my country. The French in this book spend all their time eating or having sex. Sometimes for variety the women will tie scarves and the men will make some political comments -- or kill for love. The book does not reflect well on Americans either, or on gays, or on Arabs, or Africans, or women... What a waste of time."
3,A quick read without a very lasting impression,"The social comedy of two very different cultures coming together was enjoyable. It reminded me of a contemporary Daisy Miller; a more modern American in Paris. Although I enjoyed how the book sped up at the end, the violence and action filled ending seemed out of place in this calm type of novel. Although I could identify with the narrator's struggle of being a foreigner in another country, I was not able to connect with any of the other characters. I also felt like I had to know some French to read this novel because many french words were not interpreted, which was very frustrating."
4,The best Laid plans... .,"Finally, an Anglo-American has pulled something original out of the raked-over coals of pop-France literature. Le Divorce is far more than a patchwork of unrelated cultural anecdotes, or an amateur psycho-analysis of French mindsets. Her novel contains a concrete plot supported by a melange of romance, gossip, and violence--all the requisites of a good novel. Talk about the best laid plans... !"
2,Nominated for the Nat'l Book Award??,"How this book was nominated for the National Book Award I'll never understand, but this should give all aspiring writers hope. I thought Le Divorce was very poorly written indeed, with everything from tangled syntax to plot threads that went nowhere. Was there no editor? The best parts of the book were the cultural observations. I just wish Johnson had eliminated all the tedious cloak-and-dagger stuff."
2,Who Cares What Happens?,"Yes, the setting is wonderful, and the occasional commentaries of the characters on a culture not their own were sometimes humorous due to accuracy (or conversely, due to inaccuracy); but I simply was not endeared to a single character, including the narrator. Consequently, I found myself not caring what happened to the characters. Lacking any strong positive feeling about a single character, a strong NEGATIVE feeling can often make for a positive reading experience. Sadly, there was no such strength of feeling at that end of the spectrum, either. I continued reading, hoping for a change. None was forthcoming."
2,Disappointing.,"I'm a Francophile, read/write French, and have been to Paris, so this book held great promise for me, but I couldn't get interested in this particular story; I'm surprised that this book has received so many good reviews. I didn't care about any of the characters, especially Isabel. As I read, I skimmed more and more, hoping that it would improve, but it never really piqued my interest and I gave up before the conclusion, not even caring how it ended!"
3,Nice Parisian flair but then what?,"I enjoyed Ms. Johnson's insights about Paris and the French. I also thought that she captured the intricasies of an extended family beautifully. It is a shame, however, that the main character, Isabel, was so dull. So much so , that even she recognized it and had to have an affair in order to mask it. If, Ms. Johnson had focused more on the people and the culture and less on seemingly peripheral matters like the faience theiving ring, and the kidnapping, I would have liked it more. (On a side note, I found Ms. Johnson's brief references to African Americans disturbing.)"
3,Interesting but not worth the hardcover price.,"Le Divorce has several interesting characters and even plot twists. Anybody who has been, or wants to go to Paris will enjoy the descriptions of the main character's gradual aclimation to that city, particularly if the reader is from California (where yes, previous reviewer, people can appreciate Paris). I particularly enjoyed the main character's relationship with an older man and her reflections on how others react to her.Unfortunately however, none of the other characters are fully drawn, and the reader never quite gets the sense that she knows these people, which makes it very easy to set down. Further character development would have made all the difference. On the other hand, the plot twists are interesting and, at paperback prices, it might make a nice light read. One caveat, I can't see it appealling much to men."
1,EuroDisney became Disneyland Paris in 1994.,"I am caught up on reading Oprah's book club recommendations. Due to my love of Paris, I decided to read this. Very disappointed that the author, who supposedly lives in California and Paris, didn't realize that the name of EuroDisney (opened in 1992) was changed to Disneyland Paris in 1994. I believe the book was initially published in 1997. A big faux pas--especially to Disney fans!"
1,Waste of Time,"I am glad that I bought this book used--it is not worth the retail price!The reviews said the book is a National Bestseller, and it is delightful, humorous...I kept waiting for the book to get better. Plus there were french words and phrases without translations. Maybe that is where the humor is?!?!If you would like to read a book based in Paris, read ""Weekend in Paris"" by Robyn Sisman."
1,sam's review for larry,"I was so excited when I picked up the cover of this book. The picture was interesting and artistic. After reading the back cover, I assumed that Le Divorce was going to be a worthwhile read. Unfortunately for me and my $17.00, this book was the opposite. I'm normally a big fan of modern literature, but this book did not do it for me. I found myself uninterested in the characters, which made it hard for me to care about what happened to them, which in turn made it hard for me to fully appreciate the story. Normally when sex, violence, and attempted suicide are involved in a story, I look foward to reading it; such scenes in Le Divorce were unsatisfactory at best. Reading this book was like watching paint dry."
1,BORING!,"So I've tried to read this book so many times, but every time I pick it up, I can only read a few pages. VERY BORING! I wonder how the movie is going to turn out."
1,Just not good,"Just not good literature, maybe it's not ment to be maybe it's just to be a fun read, well it's not even a fun read."
1,Now I'm bored AND irritated!,"Every time I picked up this book, I was astonished that I wasn't farther along in it. It was SO boring! Finally I skipped ahead, wondering if there was any redeeming event in the offing. But no. And just for the record, the next time I purchase a book of this nature that is purportedly written in English, but contains endless French phrases and quotations that are left untranslated, I intend to return to the bookstore and ask for a refund for the percentage of the book that is unreadable."
4,Americans Abroad in a All Their Splendour,"Diane Johnson has created a pleasant read in Le Divorce. The narrator, Isabel Walker, will lead the reader through her time in Paris as she visits her step-sister, Roxy and becomes involved in events, both silly and serious, erotic and neurotic. It is a gentle, funny comedy of clash of manners. This book recieved much hype when first released and has spawned a new sequel in Le Mariage and while perhaps not quite living up to the hype for this reader, it is still an entertaining and smart novel. The author has made the experiences of these ex-pats quite believable in sometimes unbelievable circumstances and the story moves along at a swift pace."
2,I don't completely hate this book,"The 2 things I liked about this book was that it a fast read with an American view of life in Paris.But this book gets annoying really fast. The plot and characters are unbelievable. The main character Isabel is suppose to be 20-something but she acts and thinks like a 40-something having an identity crisis.Also the characters are never fully developed, in fact there are too many characters and stories in this book in my opinion. Some characters are briefly introduced at the beginning of the book and don't appear again until many many chapters later. I went through this book with the idea that everything will come together in the end, and it doesn't. The ending is sorely disappointing. But if you need a fast quick read for a trip or the beach this book will suffice."
4,"At times great, at others only so-so","While the idea of running off to Paris appealed to me, the story had its moments where the characters turned me off. I never really bought into Isabelle's relationship with a man so much older than her. There never seemed to be a genuine attraction, and I almost disliked her for her self-absorption. Her sister was also self-centered, and not exactly an empathetic character. The best thing about this book is the backdrop of Paris. Johnson did a wonderful job of making me feel like I was there, I just wished I'd enjoyed the characters that brought me there a little more. On the whole, I didn't dislike the book, I just expected more."
2,How about an annullment instead?,"The story is disconnected and stuffed with odd characters. It is somewhat of a sad story that the author is trying to make light of but systematically missing every opportunity for accomplishing that goal. I never understood why a young attractive college student from California seeks to sleep with a 70-yr old man (Uncle Edgar)or what is at stake for her in the relationship. She claims to be in love with him but sleeps around with a couple of guys who are quickly mentioned. Her sister is a spoiled sniveling brat who only garners sympathy from the reader because her husband leaves her while she is pregnant. Basically, Le Divorce lacks flavor, depth, timing, and sense of humor."
2,Not thrilled,"I read that this book was a national bestseller and national book award finalist and figured I couldn't go wrong. Unfortunately, I did. I just could not get into the book no matter how long I read. Just not my cup of tea in how it's written I guess."
5,Loved It!,"So it's not Shakespeare! It's a great read, hilarious, the characters are wonderful, the glimpse of French sensibilities from an American perspective delicious. I read it on a cross country flight, was completely diverted from the tedium of flying, and actually laughed out loud several times. I recommend it highly."
3,Le Divorce,"This is a lovely, quick read. I enjoyed the California girl take on things French as well as things stateside. Naturally the book deals in generalities regarding both the French and the American. However this a fun sort of generality. It certainly beats boring old Peter Mayle fussing around the south of France worrying about his plumbing and constantly going somewhere for dinner. Diane Johnson actually makes a story out of the book, including a bit of mystery, a murder and some good sex - after all she is a liberated Cali girl. I live on the beach and often take book breaks -- this isn't real heavy thought provoking reading -- but it is well written and certainly beats a lot of fiction out there by a mile. If you have an interest in Paris, and who doesn't, and can get past a bit of snobbishness as to deep thinking buy the book and enjoy."
4,Intriguing.,"LIked it. I couldn't identify necessarily with main character, but liked her. Intriguing book which makes you think about life choices, how we make them."
1,"Canned characters, bad writing, awful cliches",This book was so disappointing. I am an American living in France and it seems that all the authors ideas about cultural diffeances are based on old pre war novels and tourist guides. The French are differant but they are also real. I have never noticed any French person making a big deal about powdered sugar V. cubes. D Johnson mentions the significance of this decision at least 10 times. She really should get out more.
4,Expatriates in France,"This book, at times witty and humorous, reminds me of ""Portrait of Lady"", ""Daisy Miller"" and a ""Moveable Feast"" combined. The theme of the novel is the old world vs. the new world. American innocence next to European jadedness and fiendishness. It is also a good example of the modern novel. That being said the book was somewhat slow moving and I thought the descriptions of the French and French living were a bit cliched. Particularly the part where the main character, Isabel, becomes involved with a much older Frenchman (Colette does it much better). However, it is still a good book."
5,An intelligent person's beach book,"I read this book each day on the train during my trek to and from the office. I loved it. I was disappointed when my morning train ride ended and could hardly wait for the evening ride to begin. For such a pleasant read, it was packed with thought provoking passages. Her characters were interesting and fresh. I thought about it long after the train ride was over, and have a long list of friends I want to send a copy of this novel."
1,So predictable it's tiresome!,"This book failed to engage me from the first page. Isabel, Roxanne, Edgar and all the others were straight out of Central Casting. I didn't find one thing to like about this book except my perserverance in struggling through to the final page where the book just fizzled away."
2,Self-conscious and slow,"I picked up this book when it came out and was so unimpressed at the start that I put it down again. I recently discovered it in the bookcase and this time finished it though I don't know how. While advertised as intelligent and humorous it isn't particularly so. The characters are all ciphers -- you don't get in any of their heads. The narrator, Isabel, addresses the reader while relating her first-hand experiences, yet seems to turn all-knowing when it's convenient. There's a particularly annoying habit of foreshadowing along the lines of: ""If I'd only been more XYZ, I would have seen the catastrophe coming."" Some of these catastrophes turn out to be ... not so catastrophic. The ending is pat and the reactions of the characters to a true catastrophe don't feel real. One of the books where I just don't understand what anyone else sees in it."
1,Boring,I agree with many of the reviewers - I am amazed by the critical acclaim this book received. The book was difficult to finish because I lost interest in the characters and the story. The author's use of French language without translations drove me crazy - I cannot believe the editor allowed it. All in all - I would not recommend the book.
2,"Spoiled, Vain and Self-absorbed Characters","The book, Le Divorce, is well-written but this does not mean that I have even remotely enjoyed reading it. The spoiled, vain and self-absorbed characters are a complete distraction. I have found this book to be overly impressed with itself.My vote, 2 Stars - take a pass on this one.SAM"
1,Warning!,"This book was a complete disappointment. I only finished it because I was reading it for my book club (at my suggestion!). I found it impossible to like the lead character, a selfish young woman with a complete lack of good morals. The book seemed to wonder aimlessly with the thoughts and desires of the main character without developing any of the other characters or even the very thin plot. Additionally, the author seems to assume the reader knows French! I believe she was trying to show Isabel's progression in learning the language and culture but in the end alienates the reader. Save your money!"
2,Not very exciting,"I wanted to read this book since there was a movie coming out based on the book. Well I sure hope that the movie is better. It really started out slow, but I continued reading it hoping that would get better. It didn't get much better. Towards the end, somethings started to happen, but it was a little too late."
2,Undeserving of the buzz,"Took this book with me on a long flight (Seoul - Delhi). I was eager to read a book set in France to get my mind off of Asia for a while. Too, the trade reviews said it was witty, well-written, etc. In a nutshell, it disappoints. It isn't particularly well written--there are several places (sorry, not motivated enough to go back and find examples) where the author's idiosynchratic usages make one wonder if she's a native English speaker. They are either editorial oversights or blunders. The characters are uninteresting. The plot bores. Bottom line: over-hyped and mediocre."
5,loved this book!,"totally enjoyable and clever book. All the expected components of a bestseller are there. P.S. I was bored by her 'Persian nights', i've made it through half of the book, hoping that it would pick up.... and well, it didn't"
3,"Ah, there could never be a show like WKRP again....","It was interesting to read how the show got to be made. Great interviews and everyone involved except some major directors. The writing was college term paper level, but fun to read and to remember how wonderful the show was. It was written around the time that the New WKRP was on, and that show was awful. A good quick read."
3,From the view of a high school student,"I am a Junior at Waterford Mott High School in Michigan. In my A.P U.S. History class this is our book. The lack of actual information in the work is spellbinding. There is more fluff inside this book than on a six foot poodle.However interesting the height of each American President may be, is it truely necessary to know what that height is in feet as well as meters?The book could benefit from some revision. The opinion of the author is also far too evident, Class room History is better represented in a n unbiased form, especially in an A.P. class where it is the goal for the students to form their on opionions on historical events and their causes. Bold words and a glossary would also be useful to students, for it is quite the challenge pulling fact out of fluff."
5,Review for the American Pageant History Book Review,The book was exactly as I ordered. The pre-purchase details were exact so that I could make the best decision of which book to order. I am satisfied.
2,Not up to standard of first,Nowhere near as good as their first recording. Get the first and bypass this one. Just a one hit wonder?
1,check the steinberg site before you buy this one,"The first problem I experienced with this software was it could not see my cd drive. I went to the Steinberg site (the company who supports this software) and found that there are quite a few problems with this software. I also searched their site for technical support and could not find any. Maybe it is there, but it was hard to find. I wanted to return the software but I bought it here (Amazon)...."
1,DiMaggio DiSappoints,"Another ""untouchable"" is disrobed in public. First, Boston priests, now this. It's a greasy tabloid in book form, mostly undocumented with impossibly intimate, fly-on-the-wall commentary. Please. It's a slow read but a decent bathroom book. Yes, you CAN put it down. Joe D. comes off as a miserly skinflint with a cold winter gripping his soul, enjoying an alarming countenance with the Mob and tortuous relationships with a succession of bimbos (one more notable than the rest.) He displays as an unrequited Scrooge, sleeping alone all through Christmas Eve with no trio of ghostly visitors to save him from himself. Humbug. This book debunks all the legend, all the grace and presence of the man, other than his undeniable prowess on the field. This hero wore a black hat. Buy it used or get it as a present."
2,DIMAGGIO-THE INTRUSION,"I started to read THE HEROES LIFE AND HAD A HARD TIME CONTINUING. the Editorial comment states that this is the book that Dimaggio wanted no one to write and that among other things relates of dimaggio""s greed and shame---- well why are we ""treated"" to such a book. THE dIMAGGIO i KNEW AND REMEMBERED was a classy gentleman with style and dignity. Nonetheless i remember the baseball Dimaggio who was one of baseball Heroes who in 13 short years left an indelible mark not only on baseball but on the Nations conscious . He was remembered as every boys dream that he too could become a great player-he could become like dimaggio. What purpose does it serve to portray OUR hero as a distrustful, jealous, greedy cheap miscreant. I am disappointed in this book- would this book been published if Dimaggio were still alive---- SHAME--- WHEN I FINISH READING THE BOOK I WILL RETURN WITH MORE IMPRESSIONS."
5,I'm a Yankee fan who loved the book...,"Cramer's portrayal of the man behind the myth is amazing. I found his exploration of the man through stories from friends and acquaintances to be a powerful perspective. The author was careful to explain relationships, and that allowed me to decide how credible each story might be. I was staggered by the tales of Joe's early years with the Yankees - the pressures, the achievements and the glory were all Herculean - and the grace with which the 19 year-old boy handled it all. Beyond the baseball career, there was a man that knew how to be a legend. Anyone who loves baseball, love stories and/or the mad, mad world of capitalism will love this book."
1,Hey Cramer---what'd Joe ever do to you?,"This man had no business writing a ''biography'' of someone he obviously hated so much. And I use the word ''biography'' loosely.Cramer wrote as fact what he couldn't possibly know---like what Mr. DiMaggio was thinking, for example---and of course wrote it in a negative light.Make no mistake folks, this is a GLARINGLY FICTIONALIZED biography.I can't believe it was excerpted in Newsweek. It should have been in Weekly World News next to the alien who gave birth to his own twin."
1,"This book is not about BASEBALL, it's about TABLOID GOSSIP","I'm not really sure what I expected from this book, but what I got was glitzy tabloid gossip about Marilyn Monroe, Toots Shor, Frank Sinatra ad nauseum. This book was not written by someone who cared about baseball at all, rather by someone who obsessively wishes they were part of the papparazzi crowd 40-50 years ago. Richard Ben Cramer gets off on gangsters, gambling, drinking, womanizing, and celebrity worship and splays this sick addiction out for the reader.In a 500+ page book about Joe Dimaggio, there's maybe 1 page about Mickey Mantle. Maybe 2 or 3 about Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Yet there is page after page about Marilyn Monroe, her affairs, her addictions, and her problems. It's sick, and has little to do with Joe Dimaggio.Joseph Pulitzer should be turning in his grave."
3,Should have stuck with the myth,"With sports icons, it is better to stick with the myth than to dive too deep into the truth of their lives. How much of Cramer's book is truth is a matter of debate, judging by some of the other reviews. I found many ""facts"" a little hard to believe. I also found the section on his life with Marilyn Monroe very tedious. However, in spite of inaccuracies, a picture emerges of a hero who was anything but. DiMaggio may have been one of the greatest of all time, but he spent most of his life bitter and angry. If fame and fortune left him so distrustful of everyone around him and made every relationship toxic, I wonder if he'd been better off if he'd gone out to sea with his dad and become a fisherman."
4,Excellent reporting from a great writer,Richard Ben Cramer has written a book almost as good as his previous work on the 1988 presidential election. Dimaggio's life is carefully studied from extensive interviews and source reviews by the author.A great deal of the book deals with Joe's relationship with Marilyn Monroe and his connection with the sports memorabilia business from 1989 to his death in 1999.The only criticism of the book is it omits a great chunk of Joe's life from Marilyn's death in 1962 to the San Francisco earthquake in 1989.If you are looking for just a sports book this book wouldn't be for you. But if you like biography and an excellent writer this is a good one.
5,You don't have to be a baseball fan to love this book,"Richard Ben Cramer is an amazing writer. From the opening words of this book he takes the reader on a journey into a life, into the life of a poor quiet boy from San Francisco who suddenly has fame and fortune thrust upon him in New York City, who becomes a hero to all of America. This is a book about a man who was a hero at a time when we really had heroes, and when we expected our heroes to be perfect. Cramer gives us the inner life of the hero with such breathtaking insight and accuracy that we are left with a deep understanding of how Joe Dimaggio's life is at once an American success story and an American tragedy."
3,Not a good tribute to an American Hero,This book is a difficult read and does not really doJoe D. justice. Interesting but I expected better - or perhapsmore.Probably a must for a true baseball fan but still disappointing.
1,dimaggio ----defamed,"After reading ben cramer's defamation of baseball hero joe dimaggio i felt myself disliking the author more and more with each nasty story he felt compelled to relate for the obvious purpose to evoke the readers emotions---CRAMER misread the reader intelligence--- cramer pulled himself down with each useless negative story- one after the other just in case the reader was a real ......- instead it has become clear that dimaggio's image remains but cramer/ 's image needs repair. If one had any doubt of cramer's motives all doubt was removed when he appeared on brian gumble show and was feed softball questions and related one story after another putting the YANKEE CLIPPER down---he only suceeded in making a fool of himself----IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO READ A MORE GENTLE BOOK ON DIMAGGIO READ ""joe dimaggio- promise"" ----"
2,BORING BOOK ABOUT A BORING GUY....,"Joe DiMaggio was certainly a great baseball player, but I'm not too sure why he has been idolized as some kind of AMERICAN ICON.This book is a really tough read and really did'nt tell me anything that I already did'nt know. I rated this with 2 stars simply because the author Richard Ben Cramer overloads 500 pages, and it was probably a lot of work for him. I would'nt recommend this book."
2,dimaggio-the baseball hero,R b CRAMER has a hit on his hands but it was planned that way---according to his interview on the F A N radio station he was approached by his publisher to write about dimaggio---- at least we have a motive why the book about a plain man is so sensational---- glamour - greed- distrust- disloyalty- it sells books---- itr makes money---- i for one am disappointed that our HERO is tarnished after he is not here to rebut----
3,Another book about a Yankee player.,"Like a lot of people in flyover country, I get a little tired of the same old Yankee idolatry. A man like Stan Musial who lived a n honorable life, whose baseball statistics completely ovrshadow those of Dimaggio, was not even elected to the all century team. The committee had to put him on the list. He had not been a Yankee."
1,The Exploitation of a Legend,"Richard Ben Cramer used secondary sources and cleverly disguised them as primary. Joe DiMaggio ignored Mr. Cramer for good reason. Cramer relates that DiMaggio spit up blood at 4 in the morning during his illness. How does Mr. Cramer know what occurred if only DiMaggio was present? Cramer ""sets up"" the reader through the use of language to become sympathetic to his point of view. There is little excellence left in the world. Cramer and those who share his philosophy take pleasure in attempting to destroy the excellence of others. It will take a lot more than a Richard Ben Kramer to tarnish the excellence of Joseph Paul DiMaggio. Read the book and evaluate Cramer's stance. The loser is Cramer."
3,Pulitzer Prize?,"I can't believe (I mean REALLY can't) all the reviews that mention how well-written this book is. I'm 100 pages (maybe 150) into it and am worn out (totally) by all the parenthetical asides. (Check out the excerpt). Somebody! (Anybody)! I'm begging you (Pleading, even) Tell me that Richard Ben (leave off the 'jamine') Cramer at some point (any point) stops with all the asides that are set off with parentheses. Although the information is very interesting (I could almost say 'fascinating') the endless parentheses are infuriating. I'd like to ask the author (and especially his editor) why they couldn't construct a sentence (or paragraph) that would negate (render unnecessary) the use of all the asides.I'm taking all the info in the book (given the fact that all sources are secondary or more) with a grain of salt, but so far I'd say it's a worthwhile read. (I hope the asides go away though.)"
3,"Great Detail, a little too much sometimes!","As a baseball fan and especially a Yankees fan I was anxious to read this book and I am glad I did. I am not sure how Cramer obtained as much detail about this god with clay feet as he did. But it is truly amazing the first person stories he was able to get of those who knew Dimaggio. This book is so relevatory, so much better than some of the sports biographies that are out there. You learn much about Joe's family life, or the lack of family life, both as a boy and as an adult. It is a sad story of one who failed at all human relationships, while being admired from a distance by so many. But at times Cramer gives us just a little too much as when he relates how one beauty compared Joe's male organ to Milton Berle and Joe came out champ again."
3,"Detailed to a fault, but mean- spirited throughout","One would have to be a fanatic fan of Joe D. to want to read all the details of his life in this very detailed work. One would also have to be a tremendously resentful and mean- spirited person to enjoy the way the author treats his subject. I am not alone in this view as Wilfrid Sheed in an excellently written review of this book pointed out how completely ungenerous Ben Cramer is to Dimaggio. Ben Cramer paints the picture of a skinflint , who from day one cares about doing what he does for a profit, and whose silence inside reflected a total inability to give to others.But what about the remarkable Dimag grace, and the incredible clutch- playing? What about his leading the Yankees to pennants even after he was supposedly 'over the hill'? What about the kind of pleasure he gave to millions of baseball fans for whom he was the ultimate class act?There is a sense that this book covers everything about Dimaggio, but does not really do him justice."
3,Joe DiMaggio: The Scoundrel,"Acclaimed author Cramer should have titled his book as such. From the first page until the last it is obvious that the author has some deep seated grudge against the Yankee Clipper, perhaps because DiMaggio would not collaborate on the project when he was still alive. While there are plenty of tomes to list the accomplishments of Joe DiMaggio, this book hardly touches on the highlights - and then only as a lead in to another unfounded story about how Joe was really a schmuck. The book wastes too many pages on Marylin Monroe, but skips almost all detail from the early 1950's through to the early 1990's. The author left me with the feeling that while he was interested in the man behind the myth, he was also determined to slander both DiMaggio and Morris Engelberg (his lawyer/adviser) after they declined to collaborate on the book. If you are a DiMaggio fan be prepared you may shut the book in disgust from time to time, but all in all it is an interesting read."
3,What Happened To This Book?,"There must be some big, hidden legal, personal, or editorial reason for the terribly awkward structure of this book. It begins with Joe as a kid, covers hime season-by-season with the Yankees, degenerates into tabloibism from the time Joe met Marilyn until her suicide, and then skips from 1962 to 1989 without any explanation at all. This is something you just don't see from major authors and major publishers. What happened?As is usual from old political reporters writing books (think Halberstam or Woodard) there is no scholarship or authentication. You simply have to take the author's word that things transpired as they did. Bearing this in mind,nobody should be surprised that Cramer's approach is a hack-job -- but he does that to everybody -- there are no good guys in Cramer's world. Everyone has dirty laundry."
1,Mind as well read a supermarket tabloid,"This book was nothing but a piece of trash. First of all, it's hard to believe one thing in this book because Cramer doesn't give a source. I could write a book about how Lou Gehrig was a womanizing racist using quotes from unnamed sources, but that doesn't mean a word of it is true. I'm not saying that Mr. DiMaggio was a saint but this book tries to make him out to be a spawn of Satan. Lastly, I find it funny that one of the editor's said this book was ""elegantly"" written. Elegantly? Using racial slurs is elegant? Don't waste your money on this trash."
1,"Bitter, angry, jealous - and that's just the author","This is a bitter, self-indulgent attempt by the author to attack DiMaggio. Period. He was a bad guy... so what? He liked money? Last time I checked, the author wasn't giving his book away. The main problem isn't with the book or DiMaggio, but with the people who make guys like DiMaggio the heroes they can never be. The bar is set way too high for these individuals. No one can reach it. Our solution: write about it. Consider this: I seriously doubt anyone will write a book about the author, because while he may have received accolades for his work as a reporter, all he has really done in his life is write about what other people have done in their lives. Seems like an empty accomplishment to me, and might be the reason for the high level of bitterness and, perhaps, jealousy that came through in this book."
2,Why the personal assault?,"This book was a gift from my daughter; as such, I read it even though I knew that it was a hatchet job, for whatever reason, against a great player. At the end of the book I came away with the same conclusion I had when I started, and that is that Joe DiMaggio was one of the greatest hitters of all time (had an immaculate swing) and one of the greatest all around players of all time. As a baseball lover that is all I need to know. In short, he was idolized for his playing ability and for his quite demeanor on the field, while keeping his peccadilloes from public view - why is that so bad? What grudge the author has against Joe DiMaggio I don't know, but I see no need to attack a person based on the shortcomings of that person's personality."
3,"Part Sports Illustrated, Part National Enquirer","A pretty good book, I guess. It's hard to follow up on sources when no notes are given. There's a bit of bawdy stuff about Dimaggio's sexual escapades, his thoughts on sexual intimacy and the size of his genitals. For a while you forget it's a bio of Dimaggio and think you're reading a bio of Marilyn Monroe. A little earthy and rough, but interesting."
2,DIMAGGIO-SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT OR RE-WRITING HISTORY?,ONE OF THE PREMISES OF THE HEROES LIFE is that almost all of the reporters wrote only good things about DIMAGGIO---- for whatever reason the commentators OF dimaggio's DAY WERE AFRAID TO TARNISH HIS IMAGE----even modern day writers such as MIKE LUPICA would see only DIMAGGIOS good face---- BEN CRAMER has no such compulsions in telling us that DIMAGGIO was a flawed man spinkled with hate - distrust- greed and disloyalty----WHY was this book written-Why DO WE HAVE TO KNOW HIS PERCEPTION OF THE MAN WHO WAS OUR LAST BAseball hero --WHY INDEED
4,Great look at more than just statistics,"I enjoyed this book very much, it was a very entertaining read, failing to get five stars from me only because the author did not provide enough documentation of his facts.Mr DiMaggio was a divinely talented ballplayer- greatest ever - no, in fact, definitely not - but certainly among them.Away from baseball Joe D always struck me as both egotistical and just plain goofy. I liked the way the author gave credit to Joe's skills and accomplishments, while steering clear of a simple advertisement for a man we already knew was great on a ball diamond. DiMaggio was a very complex man, who had his failures and shortcomings, the same way all of us do.I would certainly recommend this book as an entertaining read, it's not just a stiff baseball biography, there's a lot more here than just dates and statistics."
5,The only book you will need on the subject of Jazz drumming.,"If you are going to learn about Jazz drumming, this is THE book to get. Although the book is not super thick, it has a lot of useful information. The exercises in this book are challenging and musical. This book teaches with a musical approach. It does not have exercises for the sake of having exercises. That's why it's not as thick as other books on the subject.The CD that comes with it has 39 examples and 6 play along tracks. The recordings are done very well and John Riley him self is playing on them. My favorite track is the 64 bar bass line track. It's like jamming with a bass player.This book is the ultimate tool for a drumming instructor who is going to teach the subject of Jazz drumming."
5,The Best,"If you love jazz music and you are interested to play jazz music, this is the book that you should have. Very helpful!!!"
5,Great Teacher!,"There is no wonder why Modern Drummer has had John write so much for the magazine. Not only are the exercises great, the written instruction is a gold mine of information that could take many years to learn. John's gift really is being able to teach well through written material. I will be getting all of John's books."
4,"Good information, difficult notation.","The book has lots of information and very good lesson plans, but it's written in eighth notes requiring you to transpose them in your head into eighth note triplets. I found this cumbersome since I work out of other books and haven't had to do this. It's confusing. Maybe this is the way pro's do it. For my needs, since I don't take gigs that require reading, this was a problem. But, that said, the exercises can be memorized and that can be more useful."
5,Outstanding!,"I've had this book for about a month now and am reaping increasing benefits from it. I've been playing jazz for 20+ years, and have studied various books during that period, so I wasn't sure what Mr. Riley's book would bring to the table. I was not disappointed.The beauty of this book is that there is something here for players of every skill level. The explanantions are clear and lucid, the play-alongs are superb, and the subtle insights are priceless (great photos and quotes from the masters too). Well done....and highly recommended. (I'd also recommend Kim Plainfield's ""Advanced Concepts"", to tighten up your funk, fusion, and Latin chops. If you spend a year seriously studying each of these books your musicianship and chops will thank you.Have fun...and keep swingin' !!!"
5,1000+ Amateur Astronomers Field Guide to Deep Sky Observing,Great Book! Every Amateur Astronomer should get one! I'm very happy I was able to obtain my copy at a Great Price. I hope that they come out with a Second Edition.
3,Sanawon,Check out her follw up album under her new band name SANAWON. The album is called TINY AIRPLANE and it is delicious.
3,tired of tightening straps,"Good pack for the money. Adjustable comfortable harness. Lots of room.... but...Shoulder strap buckles keep slipping which is very annoying as you are constantly having to tighten them.If it wasn't for this issue, This would have been a great pack rather than just another mediocre one."
1,Very disapointed,"After one use, the interior coating started coming off. Tried to use it again and more coating came off as we were melting butter. Bought it in January and first used it on a trip we came back from 2 days ago. Wound up tossing it and buying a $6 pan at the local dollar store."
2,Not a Backcountry Frypan,The frypan that was delivered is different from photo. The photo shows a folding handle all metal handle frypan. What was delivered was a non-stick frypan no different from a normal kitchen except that the rivets were replaced with wing nut screws. The handle has a rubberized handle at the end which makes it unsuitable for over wood cooking.The wing nuts quickly scratched the non-stick surface within a couple of uses. I am now required to carry the skillet assembled to avoid further damage. I would not recommend this product and suggest that even backpackers look at cast iron alternatives that are more durable.
1,Better than a sleeping pill.,"Wow, was this a waste of time. About 10 minutes of material (and that's probably too generous an estimate) stretched out over 94 minutes. The same stock drawings over and over and over again. The same everything over and over and over again. If they didn't have anything to say on the subject, they shouldn't have made the film."
1,awful and not educational,"If you want to learn about what different faiths believe about the concept of a Final Battle between good/evil, or God/satan, don't get this disc. It is a hodgepodge of myths from different religious backgrounds, none of them documented by relevant sacred writings and clear logic. There is plenty of still footage of artworks that seem marginally relevant to the narrator's discussion. These get revisited too often for my liking.I did not feel this video imparted a clear idea of what any of the Big 3 faiths holds as doctrine, rather I felt nonplussed.There is no discussion of the Whos and Whys of the conflict. No artwork representing the gods, players, or whatever that come to the final battle.It was not even as entertaining as a classroom lecture. Recommend you avoid it."
5,Great light,This light was perfect for my sewing area. I could swing it from my main sewing machine over to where my serger is without having to disconnect it or clear a space to move my other light. Perfect option for what I was looking for.
2,Very shoddy quality,"I have a similar Alvin swing lamp and thought it was the same product under a different brand. I wanted it in red, so I decided to get the Litesource one. I was mistaken. It looks like the same lamp but the quality is much worse. The clamp design is very bad on all lamps of this type, but this one is made of apparently an even worse plastic and part of it was cracked and snapped off as I was taking it out of the box. The pins that hold the tension rods are made of metal on the Alvin lamp, but here they are made from a plastic that bends and looks like it is about to snap off (and release a spring into someone's eye!) One of the springs came off in the box because of that. The switch cover does not stay in place. Etc. Too bad - I liked the red color, but I am getting a refund."
3,good pony pal book,"I like this pony pal book, but it is not one of my faveroites.I dont like it because there is not much adventure."
2,"OK for basic file migration, but not real networking","I bought my first laptop and for some reason assumed that a USB cable was the way to go for file synchronization.This product does what it promises (providing a primitive drag and drop interface to send files back and forth) -- good enough for a one-shot file transfer but not for day-to-day syncing. Your other applications do not get access to the remote computer, and you can't even leave the cable plugged in! (My win ME desktop would crash on startup, anyway.)[note: the CD promises an alternate software setup called ""Virtual Network,"" but I simply cannot get it to install. QVS support claims that it is not intended for this product]Two days later I was back at the store to buy an ethernet card and ethernet ""crossover"" cable. It was cheaper than this, does everything I wanted, and was only a little annoying to configure through Windows."
2,repetitive themes - more academic than artistic,very disappointing for such a talented performer. Almost seemed to have been strung together for either the money or by an editor obsessed with cultural variations of the same theme.
2,"We need a new Shakira album, this is not it.","I love Shakira, her range is tremendous, her songs beautiful. I was hoping to find more of her on this album. It loses all of the charm of her first album by letting the orchestra overwhelm her and drown her out. A total disappointment."
1,BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD !!!,I never heard such terrible remixes like these in my life. Don't buy any remixes at all !
2,Disappointment,"Shakira is the bomb, but this cd is not that great. The cd should have stuck to one language."
3,MIX MIX MIXED FEELINGS,"The EP features remixes of some of the best Shakira songs. No doubt, just about any of them will heat up a dance floor, but that's about it. It's great dance music, but will likely be found a bit boring if your intention is to listen, but not sway to the beat. Portuguese versions of her songs are also included, to cash in on the success she had in Brazil. Unfortunately, these have a noticeably diminished sound quality, evidence of quickly achieved tampering. As for her singing in portuguese, it sounds as bad as NYPD Blue dubbed to spanish for braodcasting, lifeless and unnatural! Still, a worthwhile, harmless addition to the Shakira collection, specially at EP pricing!"
4,"More variety, less length, por favor","It's true, she should've waited until after Donde Estan Los Ladrones to put this out, but it's actually pretty good. There certainly isn't enough material, and it repeats itself a lot, as far as the song list. Sure, each track may be a tad different when it comes to the re-mixed versions, but more variety and less length would've been a little better.I'm not usually a fan of re-mixes and find them boring much of the time, but I am a Shakira fan, so of course I had to add this to my collection. The best songs are the three Portuguese versions, which she made for her adoring Brazilian fans out there (those aren't re-mixes). It's interesting to sing along using the Spanish lyrics and to hear how similar/different the two languages are. This CD is full of energy, but unfortunately it's also a bit monotonous."
3,Great Remixes - it could have had more songs,"This remix CD is great to dance to or even just to listen to. The only thing that isn't so great about it is that its just ""Estoy Aqui,"" ""Pies Descalzos, Suenos Blancos,"" ""Un Poco de Amor,"" and ""Donde Estas Corazon."" Don't get me wrong, there great songs! I just think she should have waited a little longer before putting out a remix album.On the plus side:1) You DO get great remixes of the four songs.2) You get 3 of them in portuguese. Its cool to hear her songs in different languages. English, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic...I'd reccomend this album to only those who want to have every Shakira CD alive (otherwise known as the die-hard Shakira fan) or if the four songs on the album are your absolute favorite ones. For any others buy another Shakira CD, you could get better for your money."
4,Gracias Gracias Gracias,Hace 10 años había visto est cd en un local de música y por olvido por no tener dinero opté por no comprarlo y nunca más lo vi en ningún lado. Hoy gracias a amazon puedo tener en mis manos el disco que faltaba a mi colección. Muy recomendado para aquellos fans de shakira que no están satisfechos con sólo escucharla en inglés y español. Muchas gracias amazon!!!
4,I've been remixed!,"There really is no stopping Shakira -- this, as well as her newest english/spanish album ""Laundry Service"", suffice to show her fans she is definitely the next hottest upcoming thing.I'm not particular to long, drawn out techno dance remixes (there are several on this album) but some of her hits just seem to move you even more coupled with an infectious club beat (i.e., ""Donde Estas Corazon?"" and ""Pies Descalzos""). And, as that I am still an avid fan of Shakira's rock n' roll side, she still delivers a tasty morsel in ""Pes Descalcos"". Her portuguese-language fans will not be disappointed, her command of the language (not to mention accent!) is authentic.Watch out, USA! Between Shakira's saucy, sometimes scathing lyrics, soulful voice, shining talent, and dazzling good-looks, she will be coming for you next!"
4,Remixes,"This CD includes remixes of several of Shakira's biggest hits as of 1997. What I liked were the Portuguese versions, my favorite being ""Estou Aqui"". I appreciate that Latin artists are taking time to reach out to Brazilian and European audiences."
2,nothing special,"Shakira is a very talented artist,but I some how doubt she had much creative control over this one...these remixes consist of typical dance beats with her voice (in most cases) dubbed.It also features her doing ""estoy aqui"",""un poco de amor"",and ""pies descalzos""in portugese,which I guess would be cool for her brazilian/portugese fans.I will admit that the dance remix of ""donde estas corazon"" is real catchy,but overall this is kind of boring."
3,Remixes don't cut it,"Shakira is an individual, talented and cutting edge artist. Her many skills are displayed in all of her other albums, but are ruined in the Remixes. I cannot put my finger on it, but remixes never sound as good as the real product. Extra beats, speeded up etc etc. The only reason i gave this 3*'s is because of the Portugease songs. It is always interesting and enjoyable to listen to the same song in a different language. If you want to experience Shakira's brilliance, then buy another album of her's."
1,The only Shakira CD I don't like...,"I adore Shakira. This is the only CD of hers that I downloaded a few songs from (the three Portuguese ones), instead of buying the whole CD. First, like some other people have said, there are only four different remixed songs - Un Poco De Amor, Estoy Aquí, ¿Dónde Estás, Corazón?, and Pies Descalzos, Sueños Blancos. I would have loved to hear remixes of Quiero, Te Necesito, and Antología. Also, there could have been even more variety if she had made a remix CD AFTER the ¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? album.The Portuguese songs are really good, I wish there were more than three."
4,A very interesting book on Nevada's haunts!,"I picked this book up at a ghost conference and got to meet the author as well. She is very nice, and extremely knowledgable on the ghosts and history of Nevada. Based on the the repeated negative reviews by one reader, Ms. Oberding has a jealous enemy with an ax to grind.I think this is a neat little book, and does it's best to give the reader a taste of this states ghostly hangouts. I would recommend it!"
4,haunted Nevada,"Again, I thought I had submitted my thoughts when I recieved the book so ever promptly. Service was great. thanks ever so much."
1,Not a Good Book,"This book is a waste of money and I can't see anyone spending this kind of money on such a poorly written book, with such terrible photography. I read it after someone else bought it. I read their copy. Boy was he ticked to have bought a pig in a poke! He said he won't buy anything else by this author."
2,Hard to get through...,I thought this book would be a hilarious romp through the catty magazine publishing world...it wasn't. It was hard to read and I had to really push myself to get past page 100. I agree with the reviewer who said it took off towards the end. The book redeemed itself in the final chapters. But the author was whiney and irritating and I even found myself rolling my eyes while reading it.
4,A reader from Florida,"Please don't believe the surprisingly vitriolic reviews. This book is sharply observed, very well written and honestly and comically reveals the author's saucer eyed infatuation with American glamour (not to mention a few women).It reveals such interesting facts as the typical reader base of Vanity Fair being a late middle aged housewife in ""fly-over country"" of modest means, not, as one might expect, the haute monde of NYC and LA. Young also exposes the extremely rigid hierarchies at the magazine and in the entertainment industry, where a ruthless, powerbrokering agent (actually, one woman in particular) will assure their star favorable press, under penalty of crushing a journalist's career."
2,A fake meritocracy,"This book is about a fake society where 'perception is reality', where people show naked respect for power and money and where Cupido is Stupido.It gives us a good insight into the superficial mentality of the rich and famous and into the false 'meritocratic' argument by people who pretend to have earned honestly everything they possess, while in fact they inherited it. The same 'merit' should also justify the enormous income differences in the US.Toby Young's biography centres on the glossy magazine 'Vanity Fair' and his misadventures as a junior writer. It contains the well-known ingredients of booze, drugs, sex, the homo/hetero battle and his unwelcome English 'hooligan' behaviour.In fact, besides some thoughts about 'de Tocqueville, freedom and the US', his work is nearly a 'colossal waste of time' (the author's own words) and certainly not more than somewhat better gossip for insiders about totally uninteresting people."
1,"God, I feel stupid...",I suppose the dollar or so I was able to pick this thing up for here at Amazon should have told me something. Young is a really unappealing character and just not very funny. Why he has been paid to follow this thing up with a second book is way beyond me. I too hate this guy.
3,A New York view through an English telescope,"""How to Lose Friends and Alienate People"" is an intriguing look behind ""Vanity Fair"" magazine and the Condé Nasties. Although Mr. Young is an annoying cad and mostly deserved what was coming to him; he does make a strong case for what may or may not be wrong with NYC society."
1,What a horribly indulgent human and book,"This is one of those few books that you really want to root for, that the hero/author somehow learns from their errors and does a 180. This is not that book. I wish I could get back the time I spent reading this book. I will probably end up using it to light some winter fires. It is not even worth donating or passing it along.Toby Young (at least in this book) loves the sound of his own voice (even it is just whining or using his parents' credentials to give him meaning) and never truly admits just how self-indulgent, arrogant, and downright oblivious he is."
1,Ok then....I guess I'll never get those hours of my life back. Uh...how about a warning label next time?,"I'm wondering how long Mr. Young has been living under the impression that he should, indeed, pursue a career in writing...too long, meeethinks.Put down the No.2, Toby...milk n' cookie time is over. Maybe you should sit on the bench for a while and ponder the meaning of life. At the very least, quit with the ego-tripping and learn a new language...as you seem to be having trouble with your native tongue."
3,He Dug His Own Hole But Doesn't Get It,"It's hard to have much sympathy for Mr. Young. He seems to go out of his way to dig his own hole with his juvenile antics, then wonders why such bad things seem to happen to him! Throughout this book, it was clear that he was quite an admirer of his own self-importance. If you're into name-dropping and egotism, you'll enjoy this book tremendously. But, if you're like me, you'll find a few funny moments and spend most of your time learning to dislke him.It's not the worst book I've read all year, but it still only rates 3 stars. It was too much work to wade through the tacky parts in order to get to the funny parts."
3,"Yep, that's how you do it alright","British writer moves to NYC and finds that the upperclass New Yorkers he meets are not like the hacks he worked with in London, and that Americans are not English, even though they speak English, and that the New York publishing world is not at all the same as the way it's portrayed in vintage movies. Hilarity ensues."
3,Interesting - but kind of silly,"As an avid reader of V.F. I was intrigued by the premise of the book but was ultimately disappointed. Despite the book's self-deprecating title, it's obvious the writer thinks of himself as extremely clever and witty. He repeats rather boring conversations he has with not-so funny people ad nauseum - he's that guy at the party who always steals other people's jokes and then screws up the punchline. Regardless, it's an easy read and it's interesting to get someone's take on ""celebrity"" journalists like Graydon Carter and Candace Bushnell."
2,"Great Title, Loser Author","I was really looking forward to reading this book since it sounded like a fun read. And I will admit that parts were funny but the more I read this book, the more I hated the author and the book. If he had just stuck to telling his story, he would have been fine. Then it would have just been a funny book about a hapless loser. But what really made this book awful was his continual justification of why he's really a failure. Apparently it isn't his fault at all -- it's ours. Our value system apparently kept him from succeeding. It's infuriating when someone has to condemn an entire culture simply because he can't get his act together. Frankly, the fact that this drunken slacker couldn't make it in NYC proves that we have got it right. If you must read this book, borrow it from the library. We really don't need to encourage this guy with any more royalty money."
1,"When He Says He Has Negative Charisma, He Ain't Kidding","This is a whiny anti-American book by a guy who really, really wants to be a part of the crowd he tears apart. Despite the fact that he idolizes the most superficial of American sub-cultures, it ends up looking better than it should. The superficial entertainment and fashion biz is criticized for not being dysfunctional enough. At one point, he claims not to be able to make close friends in NYC because no one is willing to get drunk with him. Bottom line, our whole culture is slammed because we're not drunk enough, not drugged out enough, and not sexist and homophobic enough. The only big mistake that Graydon Carter made was keeping him on staff as long as he did. If you must read this book, borrow it rather than encouraging this loser-wanting-revenge writing with royalty money."
3,"Nice, as long as you don't dig into the book's main purpose","As long as you don't take this book too seriously, you can really enjoy it - it's funny, juicy and has some brilliant points about democracy in America (well, nobody can blame DeTocquille for not being brilliant). However, after 100 pages the book becomes really annoying, as you notice that the only purpose of writing it was designed to justify Young's family reputation as good Britons who help society, Young's failure to date beutiful and famous girls, as well as his failure to understand how the American system works (or, put simply, why Britain is not the huge Empire it used to be 100 years ago). So, to summarize, except of some nice pieces of stuff as to the New York Giants' inner life gossips, the British whining Oxford kid Young has anything really interesting to offer us. oh, I forgot, he also studied in Harvard..."
2,Repetitive and Dull,All you really need to do is read the first fifty pages over and over and over and you will get the jist of this entire novel. Young comes off sounding so whiny throughout this book that you (like me) might actually be happy he keeps failing.I thought this novel would bring some humor (Sedaris-style) but instead left me wanting to re-read Me Talk Pretty One Day. Pass on this one.
2,"We're just not that into you, Toby","Some one wrote in their review that they'd paid $1.00 for the book. YOU PAID TOO MUCH. The endless ""school of hard knocks"" routine is beyond tiresome, the crowd Toby longs to be included in is obligingly repulsive and what we're left with is wishing there were some way to return the book for a full refund in order to make a contribution to Toby's permanent extradition from the literary world."
1,I WANT MY TIME AND MONEY BACK,What a waste of time! I gave up on this peice of drivle! Who wants to read about such a miserable creaton.
1,How to become a failure and get paid for it!,"This book was pretty much what it promised to be until you get to the end. Then Toby begins a whining tirade to justify his failure to make it in Manhattan. He uses the example of George W. Bush to prove his point that you must have connections and family money to suceed in America. Toby, did you ever hear of a guy named Bill Clinton? He was president of the United States the ENTIRE time you lived in this country. The difference between you and Bill (and for that matter George) is that they were willing to start at the bottem and WORK their way up. Also the United States of America does not begin and end within the city limits of NYC, LA and Washington, DC. To bad you never knew us and hasta la vista baby."
4,Pretty funny,"This is a pretty funny look at a pathetic person. Actually, pathetic people. Young really has no redeeming qualities as far as I can see, but then again, he doesn't pretend to have any. N.Y. socialites are good fodder for ridicule and, in that sense, Toby delivers.Another funny look at a guy stuck in a job while he's trying to merge into the 'fast lane' is ""No One's Even Bleeding""."
3,All you ever wanted to know about Graydon Carter (and more),"Basicly, if you're not interested in the New York publishing world (and Vanity Fair in particular), this probably isn't the book for you. But if want to know the nitty-gritty about working for Conde Nast or about the reign of terror PMK holds over New York reporters, this is your book."
3,Wait for the Paperback,"A friend from the U.K. recommended this book, so I bought the hardcover version. I wish I'd waited for the paperback. It's an OK memoir-import written in a self-effacing style by an Oxford-educated, balding, rather lazy name-dropper. Young's pseudo-sociology is completely lame. I can see why the Brits loved this book: it appeals to the insecurity-about-personal-success epidemic in the U.K. My main complain about Young's memoir is that he bashes Prozac and Zoloff several times in the book, yet he seems to be a person who genuinely could benefit from some anti-depressant relief."
3,Life of a Conde Nast Drone,"The author is both obsessed by fame and antagonistic to authority, even famous authority. His job at Vanity Fair required the reverse -- a totally blase reaction to movie stars and some judicious sucking up to one's superiors. He fails at both. The book comes across as far more likeable than the author. He has the courage to admit he's a jerk. The two stars are because the writing is crisp, and the stories are often outrageous, in a tell-all Enquirer way. In the end, I don't know what he wrote at VF, besides photo captions."
2,"Well he got a movie deal so it's not totally bad,,,","But it's pretty bad.Toby Young comes to America for a job at Vanity Fair and succeeds in American Cafe Society about as well as the Duchess of Windsor did with the Royals after her husband's abdication. Imagine the Conde Nast headquarters as a combination of high fashion and low life and make the author the lowest of th e low lifes and you have a pretty good clue where this memoir goes.There is a movie deal, but my bet is that it will be greatly fictionalized because failure just isn't that funny."
3,"Some good stuff, often very funny, but he is annoying.","Although some of the anecdotes included are hilarious, Young comes off as shallow and definitely someone you wouldn't want to get too close to. Appearing to be nobody's friend, not even his own, he still has some very good insights on America, democracy, and how seriously Americans take everything. Much of the book is drop dead funny, but his tendency towards whining about his personal life and his career, especially as compared to others, does not add anything much for the reader. The best parts of the book come when he relays anecdotes about the Conde Nasties and the NY social scene and the more thoughtful passages on democracy and his experiences while at Harvard. Overall, I did enjoy the book."
3,a fun read,"This is an enjoyable book, although I take issue with Young's obsession with the good old days of New York journalism. Miniver Cheevy, anyone? On the other hand, by most accounts the Vicious Circle was full of self-absorbed, backbiting alcoholics, so he would probably fit right in.One funny thing is that he seems to think he has skewered Graydon Carter but Carter actually comes off looking good, like a relatively decent human being, given the context."
3,Skip the first 175 pages! The last 150 are worthwhile.,"""How to Lose Friends..."" starts out with a few witty anecdotes, helping to set the mood. However, after page 50 or so the book takes a nosedive. Mr. Young spends the next 100 plus pages in full ""tell all"" mode. Dropping famous names and gossiping like, well, a bitter gossip-columnist. Although, Mr. Young seems to present facts objectively, he never really assumes any blame for what happens to him. (Although, his objectivity might be the way he owns up to his faults.)During the first half, Mr. Young drops some hints of skill as a thoughtful and engaging writer. (This is what compelled me to continue.) Finally, somewhere around the two-thirds mark, my faith in the author is justified. Mr. Young finishes strong with clever and insightful looks at American culture, success/failure, and love on both a macroscopic and personal level. I plan to keep my copy, with the caveat that I will tab the ""tell-all"" pages, or simply tear them out."
2,WYSIWYG,"Who buys a pond filter and doesn't get the hose with it? Damn.i did. I was so disappointed, its like buying a ice cream cone one place, the ice cream in another, and the toppings in another. Guys, the filter works, but be prepared to go shopping for the hose after......its two different sizes...good luck, you'll need it......not me again on this."
3,"Almost, but not quite","This books almost makes it as a compelling tale of an orphaned youth who is rescued from tribal war in Africa and taken to a ""better life"" in England. His anger and resolve are contrasted to clan/gang rivalry in England. The premise and story line of the book are both fine. The problem comes from the confusion of details. The reader is never quite sure who belongs to what group and why they do what they do. There just isn't enough development. I never got enough from any of the characters to really care about them as much as I wanted to."
4,"Cool back support, but not for in car use","This is a cool back support that I purchased for in car use, but now I use it with my office chair.If you are planning on using it in the car, forget about it! There are two reasons why it does not work:(1) It's simply too large. It will push you away so much that the side supports won't hold you in the seat any more. So every turn you make you'll end up sliding to the opposite side. Extremely annoying!(2) It's mash cover will allow air to blow against your back, which even in summer time can be a surprisingly uncomfortable feeling.On the other hand I found it to be PERFECT for in the office use. I use it with an office chair that has a relatively long back, but lacks any back support. It makes a huge difference. It helps me keep a better posture so I can focus much longer."
5,Glad to find this book,"Out of print , but this book has as much to say as it did in the first edition. Buy it"
5,New Insights on an Old Topic,"In spite of so many other commentaries on the Lord's Prayer, Wright manages to refresh our view of the greatest of prayers. In this small book, you get the benefits of the insights of a first-rate scholar without having to plow through his much longer works (although the longer works are indeed worth plowing through with determination). Wright emphasizes two themes that we tend to forget. The first theme is that the Lord's Prayer is about asking God to transform this earth and our earthly desires, not about pie in the sky. Secondly, the Pater Noster is about our ""signing on"" to the Kingdom, a Kingdom full of unpredictable transformations and exoduses. Wright reminds us that in the Our Father we put our entire selves, with all our earthly desires and concerns, in the hands of the Father. The book is more than worth the small expenditure of time it takes to read it."
5,6 Stars,"This book has had a profound impact on my prayer life and understanding of prayer. I have an academic background in theology and biblical studies, but my experience with and attitude towards prayer has always been deficient. Faith for me was overly intellectual, not personal. Troubling events in life have driven me to take prayer seriously and make it meaningful. This book helped make that happen.This is a challenging book written in graceful prose. He digs deeper into faith, prayer, and the Kingdom, than our conventional teachings have offered. After I finished reading this book, I immediately turned to the first page and read it again, taking notes. I expect to be reading it again soon."
3,rsx and civic,"FYI- If you own a acura or honda, the sandwich adapter that comes with it does not fit your oem oil filter, when you put your oem oil filter on it you can see there a small openning to the edge where the built in thermal stat is at, it will leak badly, I wouldn't bet on it to work with after market oil filter either since mobil-1 makes the same size as oem, but the rest is good. Just buy partial and get the sandwich adapter elswhere. Make sure you get the adapter that has oil cooler plus oil temp/oil pres ports for future upgrade if you don't have them. Have fun all....."
3,Oil cooler,"Item was complete and looked fine, but I am having to make modifications to the car so it will fit."
2,Too little substance,"I thought, given the premise of this book, that it would reveal more about the character of Early. The reader knows all there is to know about his mother, her background, her marriage and her parenting skills. Frankly, I was surprised to learn that Early was a remarkably good student and apparently considered to be a steadying influence by his peers. There were too many ""dead ends"" in this book for me - the letter written by Early with gay incidents is one; another is why the father was so uninvolved. I was disappointed in this book."
4,Can easily relate!,"I really enjoyed this book. Although it is not an uplifting story, I could really relate to Kathyrne and saw a lot of myself in her. I was a lot like her when raising my 25 yr old daughter - no matter what she did wrong, I rationalized it learning too late that she really was in trouble. As I now have 5 year old twin boys, this book really made me think long and hard about my parenting skills! I highly recommend it."
2,VERY FLAT,"Don't waste your time... I was so disappointed with this book. The first chapter and the last 4 chapters are the only worth wild ones! The middle of the book is so dull and flat.If you want a fabulous read, in my opinion, read Snow Flower and the Secret Fan by Lisa See. This is a beautiful book well worth your time. You will not be disappointed- I promise!!!"
1,Pretty Lame,This is a book full of mullet wearing cleavage popping wanna be's. It is like Heavy Metal Parking Lot without the humorous commentary from the fans and thier self parody.
1,Don't waste your money,This book was a total waste of money. Unless you were in this book or know somebody in this book don't waste your money. Spend your money on a concert ticket and you'll see everything in the book.
4,Individual Studies,"This text was great for individual studies since the full answer key/partial solutions are in the back. The text starts a little heavy and detailed, but has great depth and current information."
3,Tempted to Mass Production?,"These three short stories, as well as the next two collections of shorts, have a weird ""Mass produced"" feel about them, which is not attractive. Like Stout signed a contract with the book-of-the-month club and write these quickly in order to fulfill it.""Bullet for One"" is the best of the lot here. ""Disguise for Murder"" ranks just below it, but ""The Gun With Wings"" has some shameless cliches and hackneyed plot devices seen in 1951 pulp deteective fiction. Stout was, obviously, capable of so much more.In a real way, it's understandable why none of these was picked for A&E;."
3,wrong CD in package,"I ordered the CD ""Big Band Hits of 30's & 40's"" by Enoch Light but when it arrived, the back cover and spine were for the correct CD but the front cover and the CD itself were ""Big Band Hits of the 40's & 50's"" by Enoch Light, which has a different set of songs. It was in the original packaging as well."
4,Zina jewelry is unique,"There are two things that rate the four star rating; the stones are too few and too small for the price, and the chain above the swirled pieces is rather weak. I would have liked some adjustability in the length. All that said, this is a beautiful piece and I look forward to wearing it for many years."
1,"Flimsy, tiny paperback version. Very disappointing.","The Art of Jewish Cooking was nothing like the original version I had. It was a tiny, flimsy version that wouldn't hold up to a month of use in a real kitchen."
3,Marrying Up or Marrying Down?,"Grow up.Marry a man with prestige and moneyLive happily ever after.That is what Athena, Paris Montague's mother, has mapped out for her. Does Paris have plans or a mind of her own? Paris knows that one day she'll find her wealthy Mr. Right. What she didn't bank on was meeting Tyson James. Tyson is Paris' sexy maintenance man. Not meeting her family's expectations on the financial scale, Paris keeps Tyson a secret. JaBari Nolan is the ""chosen one,"" hand picked by Athena herself. But for Paris, something with JaBari just doesn't add up. Will Paris go with her heart, which Tyson has unexpectedly stolen, or will she do right by the family? For love of money or for love of love?Marrying Up was a cute read. No frills, no thrill, just a decent read."
3,All that glitters is not gold,"Paris , well educated, middle class, enjoying the single life with her working class maintenance man Tyson is under pressure from her middle class mother (Athena) to marry well. Athena pushes Jabari who seems to be the ideal catch onto her daughter. Will Paris bow under the pressure of her mother's and cousin Alexis, who is a mini Athena expectations? Will she develop a backbone and stand up for herself? Is Alexis who is engaged to IBM Walter, doing what she really wants for her life or just following a script? Good story tho the women apart from secondary character Sarah come across pretty shallow. The best guy in the whole book is Tyson even tho I wished he dumped Paris shallow butt for someone else lol"
4,well made collar,the product looks to be of good guality and value for the price. it did not fit however and the cost to ship it back was too high to be practical.
5,Good quality easy to use,Bought this mostly as a gag gift for a friend but also use them at work. These are nice as they are adjustable so you don't have to have 3 different collars for three different sized adults.
2,No packing slip with order,"The product was satisfactory, however, does not fit. I am unable to return it as there was no packing slip enclosed. Amazon.com says to return directly to the manufacturer, but how can I do that? I have no paperwork showing proof of purchase."
2,ok for the price,the company has tried to get me to change my review of their product. did not appreciate that at all. the item was late in arriving though they try to tell me i am wrong. there is not enough padding in the product to make it comfortable to wear for over an hour but does provide relief and i appreciate that. no review of mine should ever come into question as i am not negative or positive but want to be objective for the benefit of others.
1,You get what you pay for,"Once again... you get what you pay for. It was cheap, it is cheap. Doesn't really work very well. It's just awkward to use."
2,Cheap Material,"The product came in about a week after I ordered it which is a plus and that's the ONLY good thing I can say. The product is CHEAPLY MADE. The picture looks better then what the product actually is. The collar adjusts the length of the neck but not around the neck, so if you have a skinny neck this won't fit. The collar is cheap plastic and cheap thin foam cusion that looks like it came from a packing plant. DO NOT get this product. I would return it but surprise, surprise no return receipt or any receipt for that matter. Ticked off to say the least."
5,Stifeck,"There is a great quality product, just what i need, comfortable and light, all the material are designed for confort and durability"
5,Simple and Delicious,"This book is the perfect way to get started cooking some great pasta. The first 5-10 pages provide the reader with the basics to pasta, preparation, proper cooking utensils, etc. The book is then divided into chapters such as tomato sauces, cream sauces, meat dishes, vegtable and herb pasta, and many more. The recipes are easy to read and usually contain 10 or fewer ingredients, which makes the 1/2-1 hour after work to make dinner a lot easier. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for good, easy, classic Italian pasta meals."
5,My Favorite Pasta Recipe Book,"I love this book! I learned to cook pasta from my husband's Italian mother and grandmother and I thought I was doing well, but this book has refined and simplified my pasta dishes. The book is easy to read and easy to use with step-by-step directions. After making one of the tomato based sauces, my husband said it was the best he'd ever had! There are recipes for every type of pasta, too, using seafood (my favorite), herbs and oils, and cheese. Fresh pasta, store bought, how to cook it...whether you've been cooking pasta all your life or just learning how this book is perfect. The pictures alone make it worth while. I, also, purchased the author's Ultimate Bread book and love it as much as this one."
5,Best video you can buy,The 1080p picture is just stunning! I have only one minor complaint: there are not enough choices for formatting.
1,Have to agree with the other reviewers,"I am also a big fan of Jillian Hunter, but this book was dreadful. Where was the editor? How did this get published? If this had been the first Jillian Hunter book I had ever read, I'd never read another. But fortunately, I have read the wonderful Bostcastle books first.I really echo the other reviewer who said she can't believe that Jillian Hunter wrote this. It was just a mess-- scattered characterization, slapstick humor that often didn't work-- it was just a mess. I suppose it had some charm, because I finished it, but I was shaking my head over how dreadful it was all the way along.And the ending? Who cares if Hannah finally felt like she was home? Why introduce a fully sprung daughter after the poignant scene at her grave?Sloppy sloppy writing."
1,Difficult to Slog Through,"I'm a great fan of Jillian Hunter, but this is not a very good book. There is no reason to like or even care about the two main characters. Marsali's behavior is irrational and irritating (going fishing in a gold tulle ball gown??). Duncan is not much better (a successful general sitting on the floor playing with and talking to tin soldiers??). An attempt seemed to be made to make the secondary characters cutesy and oddball, but they were simply paper-doll flat. The plot dragged along at a snail's pace with jarringly abrupt leaps forward by weeks with little or no exposition to bring the reader along. All-in-all a singularly bad book. As a matter of fact, it is so bad that I can hardly believe it was written by Jillian Hunter. I highly recommend her more recent books."
2,False advertisement!,"The item doesn't come in the package that the picture shows. It doesn't include pellets either, only the 3 speed loaders. They work perfectly, but they are all that you get."
4,"Small, affordable, and yet quite complete","For only 10 bucks, you get to see a great review of Legorreta + Legorreta's work, including pics, plans, and explanations easy to understand by the amateur reader, yet quite illustrative to the expert or architect. This is not the greatest summary of Legorreta's work, but it is in fact the best you can buy with only 10 dollars."
5,Great shades!,"Very easy to install! So easy in fact, it would be a crime to buy these from a dealer and have them put them on for you! They really do make a difference in your vehicle. A little extra shade when the sun is rising or setting, and allows you to roll the windows down a little even if it is raining."
4,Touch-up,We used the Porcelian Touch-up on the bathtub where I had dropped something heavy. You can not tell where the dent was now. Great product as advertised.
1,Very Yellow Color,"This touch up paint is very yellow for bisque. It would be a better match for almond appliances. Does not match any of my Frigidaire Bisque colored appliances. Beware if trying to match your appliances--if you order this, do a test swatch and let dry on cardboard first before using on your appliances. I may try mixing with white touch up paint to get a light enough color for my bisque appliances."
2,Wrong color,"Perhaps the product would have been all right, but they sent me the wrong color (a dirty beige instead of the white I ordered). When I tried to return it a few weeks later, it was ""too late"". It remains unopened, a reminder to me NOT to order something again."
4,Final Effort From Pop-Punk Legends,"Huntingtons always stayed under the radar, but this band was misunderestimated. Their earlier material closely resembled Ramones and other pop-punk staples - but they broadened their horizons with this album. There is a little bit of everything on this album, but all of the songs are just as catchy as always. A must-have for all serious Huntingtons fans, or anyone looking to get their pop fix."
1,Be careful,"We purchased this book for our hospital patient health resource center, and decided after reviewing it that it wasn't suitable. While I have no objection to presenting points of view of many different faiths, this book takes a strong fundamentalist view towards parenting. Much of the narrative and Biblical quotations are needlessly shaming to parents who are already struggling with the strain of a chronically ill child. The casual browser who reads the jacket blurb on this book will see only that the authors incorporate prayer in their coping suggestions, a perfectly acceptable option. This book is not appropriate for an unsuspecting parent seeking solace and support."
2,dissatisfied,I was highly dissappointed when I ordered two instead of one to save money on shipping. I was charged twice for shipping (which is three times as much as the product itself) and they came in the same package about 4 days later than anything else I ordered that day. The product itself works fine however I would either suggest using the large bottle or use a common local product.
2,"Good movie, but, falls short at the end","Initially, I bought this movie because the plot looks interesting: A bored woman finds some excitement in her life by becoming the leading lady of a ""soap opera"", filmed next door. But, at the end, the movie goes slow and annoying. And, you get lost at the end, and ask yourself: What???"
5,Solved my Headset Problem,"I couldn't figure out why no one could hear me on my new headset, well a part was missing, I was flying blind when purchasing because my work communications department couldn't tell me what to buy unless I purchased from them. Anyway thanks to Amazon and the customers that reviewed I solved my problems, this is a great buy and works well with the headset, my customers can hear me and my neck doesn't hurt from trying to type and hold the receiver."
4,"A non-compromised result, except for the Goddess","I'm not an historician, nor a poet, just a casual reader who ever loved the works by R. Graves. Moreover, I think this book is not for scientific historicians, not even for profesionalized poets. I got surprised by the many long chains of deductions Graves makes, and I suspect some of them are quite inexact or biased. Graves starts the book by stating a couple of basic questions, and they are answered along the book. I wasn't able to check if all the explanations are right, but I'm certain the book has a value by its own, even when all these assertions were pure lies -which is not the case-. I loved this book because the high variety of views on the question of dealing with religious poetry, and the absence of orthodoxia in doing so. I think ""Greek Myths"", and Frazier's ""The Golden Bough"" could be of help, or reinforcement to deal with the many ellaborations Graves left appart in this book. Not for straight-minded people, certainly."
2,"Great Poetry, BAAAD History","If you treat this as poetry or new mythology, this is a great book. Inspiring, poetic -- great stuff. Unfortunately, it's presented as history and a commentary on ancient mythology -- and that it's not. I'm a medievalist; the quality of the historical ""research"" is exceptionally low. In fact, Graves is responsible for much of the historical misinformation that plagues Neo-Paganism. He invented the Triple Goddess motif (Maiden, Mother, and Crone), the ""Celtic"" tree calendar, and the notion that lunar calendars have thirteen months. So while I acknowledge the beauty of Graves' vision, I can't recommend his book highly. It's done too much damage."
3,"5 stars for research, 2 for deliver","The author, Robert Graves, makes the case that poetry, true poetry, is inspired by a pagan goddess that permeates all mythologies and religions.He makes a solid case for this argument. He is thoroughly versed in nearly every major (as well as obscure) mythology. His research is commendable.However, I found the book extremely hard to follow. The author assumes the reader has profound understanding of mythology and culture. He also digresses often and makes his points confusing.This work reminds me of the book ""Hamlet's Mill"" by De Santilla and Von Dechend. Like ""Hamlet's Mill"", ""The White Goddess"" is a scholarly, well researched book on the power of mythology that has the unfortunate habit of confusing its readers."
3,Interesting read,"I came to this book intrigued by both its links to poetry and the ogham. I realize it is not considered a standard text for Druids, and perhaps it shouldn't be as Graves' interpretations of the Ogham, at least, are flawed as much more Ogham scholarship has been accomplished since he first wrote this book.However, the book reads like a dream. Graves' called himself a poet first and foremost and this shows in the twiting narrative he spins. His interpretation of the Cad Goddeau (Battle of the Trees) is interesting whether I accept it or not.In a way, any student of Druidry should read this book simply for the history of it, as well as to understand his lasting influence on Celtic Paganism."
2,The White Goddess,A lot of what Graves theorized in The White Goddess has been disproven since. Here and there I ran across stuff I can agree with or think hey maybe he is on to something but overall I don't jibe well with much in the White Goddess. The biggest thing is he tries to draw all these parallels and relations between Indo-European and Hebraic stuff. Its possible Graves was a well meaning (but wrong) guy but I think its just as likely he was intentionally putting out nonsense to muddy the water. Its hard for me not to think this considering the Kabballistic/Masonic/Occult secret societies with connections to the aristocracy that he was involved with and all the new age and Wiccan garbage that was heavily influenced by his work.
3,errors,"This book is boring and the illustrations are not amusing. We class found about 4 errors in this book, beware!"
3,Just as boring as the rest,As good as any physiology book can be. It's just as boring as the rest of them!
2,Can't count on it.,I was looking for a feeder to dispense small pellets for a medium size water garden/pond with a lot of gold fish. I did a lot of online searching and this was the only feeder that didn't cost a fortune. I had read the reviews which weren't that great but decided to give it a try. When it arrived I was surprised how little feed it would hold. Only enough for a skimpy week of feeding. I set it up indoors to make sure it was set properly. It took almost a week of tweeking the settings until I was satisfied. Set it outside over the pond saw it go through one cycle before leaving on vacation. Returned to find it was still half full of feed! I have it set up again and it seems to be working but I can't trust it.
2,Caveat Emptor!,"The feeder is very difficult to calibrate, to set, and to monitor because the feed hopper turns very slowly. It works, however. I had a problem with a raccoon grabbing it and opening the hopper to eat the food when it was hung too close to the side of the small pond. The raccoon did not break it however."
2,Great idea - poor execution,Too bad this product doesn't live up to the manufacturer's claims. They say one battery should last a year but my unit began slowing down after three months. I put in a new battery but it never kept proper time again. I tossed it and bought another one and the same thing happened. So now instead of an automatic fish feeder I have a manual fish feeder - I'm advancing it myself. I won't buy a third one. No other products out there that fill this need at near this price.I took it apart and cleaned it thinking that perhaps debris was holding it back. Afterward I layed it on its back and let it run without food. Keeps perfect time. Then I hung it back up without food and discovered that it runs 3 hours behind per day. Hmmmm.
3,Good Product but Tricky to Use,"I recently bought this for my parents since they like to travel. It is easy to fill and holds alot of food, the only problem so far is figuring out how to set the feeding times. The directions provided are not very helpful unless I am missing something that is obvious to others I am emailing the maker and finding out how to do this. We set it for testing by selecting 1 hour (or what we thought would be feed every hour) so that we could see how much it feeds, it took 1 hour to drop the food, which is fine except it only dropped food that once and not again until the next day. But to it's credit, I really like the feeder as a whole because we use medium sized pellets and we have three fish that could eat a dog's weight in food so we needed something that could accomodate a more generous feeding, this is it and the price is right. I'll post better instructions if I ever get some."
2,Fish mate automatic,Problem with programming the item. Not sure when fish are being feed or how much. I would not buy this product again.
4,Automatic Fish Feeder,"The fish feeder works good not excellent as it is difficult to determine the amount of food that will be dispersed each day. It also has to be reset when you change the brand of food. Once it stopped because of the battery connection. It needs to have an ON indicator ""light"".It is a good value for the price."
3,Wouldn't buy,"The blades fit my blender perfectly, the only problem is that they don't really work. I had trouble getting it to work with frozen fruit such as strawberries."
4,Just what I needed,"These blades work great in my blender. I would've given a 5 out of 5 stars, but one of the blades was missing the rubber ring that came with the other two (I ordered three of the same blade). But overall, I was happy with my purchase."
2,Needs significant improvement,"This blender blade/cutter does not work well for pureeing foods that are anything but thin and watery. This is caused by excessive pitch to the blades that results in overly strong pumping action and cavitation. i.e., when used to puree significantly viscous foods, the blades draw a lot of air down and end up not circulating the contents but only working the lower portion. My sense is that the pitch of the blades needs to be reduced about 50%."
2,NOT GENUINE OSTER,"Be warned, this is not a Genuine Oster replacement part. It is made in Mexico. The blender is working with the part, but it does not sound the same, it seems like it is cutting through my smoothie ingredients differently than the original. I hope it holds up. I would not have purchased it if I had known."
1,Don't waste your money,These are not Genuine Oster made parts. I made the mistake of ordering 2. The blades are ice repellant. They won't crush ice very well at all. The seller's return policy requires their receipt that was sent with the product. I tossed that before ever testing the blades. Live and learn. I just received genuine Oster blades from another vendor on Amazon and they work perfectly.
3,Oster Replacement blade and seal,"OEM part, so no problems with the item. This vendor is terrific--great price, excellent communication, fast and fair shipping."
1,"Product good, Seller horribly bad","The product is well known and good.But, unfortunately I ordered the part from a company which did not send me the product (even though it promptly charged the price on my credit card)and failed to reply my e-mails complaining the lateness ( and now no-show) of the product to my address.Shame on them.I am taking measures through my credit card company to get my money back!"
1,Book Should Have Been Max. 50 Pages,"This book was so repetitive. There are many illustrations that were duplicated throughout the text. Many of the illustrations are just plain pointless. The text size is ridiculously large as if to just take up space. There is no need for this book to be as long as it was, really. He refers to everyone as ""she"" and writes in a very elementary level. There are also extremely awkward in text citations that ruin the flow of the book.Pros:- a few interesting links between physical health and mental health- quick/easy read (organized by emotion)Cons:- repetitive/banal- poorly written/organized- plugs in writing advertising his other books (no thank you)- no connection between emotionsAll-in-all I pretty much despised this book. I tried to give it a chance but it seemed to be mocking the reader citing information that is already quite widely known. Don't waste your time on this."
3,"good information, poorly published","The core information in this book is fine and helpful, but the book is so poorly edited and published that it's a slog to get through. It has all the hallmarks that self-published books are known for, starting with an off-putting cover design and including haphazard editing, poor interior design and layout, amateurish illustrations, and a sort of numbing and careless repetitiveness that a competent editor could easily have straightened out. In short, good info that deserves a more professional publishing effort."
3,Anger Help?,"Book arrived on time. Content is good, and I guess with application and a will to change it could all help?This part I still have to get into! But other than expensive, time consuming, professional consultation and ""therapy"" it could help one when you get the ""Mad as hell and won't take it anymore""feelings! For serious cases, I guess it wouldn't help much? Like controlling drug abuse. alcoholism, with a book! We all know better than that?"
5,Good book,The book arrived in a timely manner and was in brand new condition. I was pleased with this experience. The book has been an interesting read.
5,Major Improvements with Depression and Anxiety,"I have been suffering from severe depression and anxiety for most of my life and regularly visit a psychologist for my problems. I found this book on my own and bought it because of the positive reviews and I undoubtedly think it is the most valuable tool I have to manage my issues. I was not methodically taught during childhood to deal with my emotions first and then my problems, nor to take responsibility for how I felt. This book has changed my entire outlook on life and was a major slap in the face at first, realizing I had trained myself to be so negative. It's an easy read, yet insightful enough to hold your attention. I have a long road to contentment but I know I'm on it now and actually feel like I can make it. Please buy this book if you are dealing with depression, anxiety or anger, and help yourself."
5,I approve this book,"This book is great for anyone experiencing anxiety, anger or depression. I read this book and it really helped me manage my emotions better and to think clearly. Dr. Lynn Clark published the book himself so it would not lose any content."
5,Pulse Revisited,"This box set is a must have for any Pink Floyd fan. It's a bit pricey but you get your money's worth since it's a Japanese import with all the good trimmings to boot. High quality remastered version of a classic PF live concert (it goes well with ""Delicate Sound Of Thunder""). They're better off being a trio. Live with it, people! Enough of the rantings! If you're not happy with it, don't buy!"
1,Nothing new under the sun,"When was the last time since Pink Floyd made a decent, original album? Mr. Gilmour and his band think we are boredom-proof. The technical precision of their performances is good as ever, but since Roger Waters left, it's all the same: technically perfect performances, but without any solid contribution to the mystic of the band. The lyrics of the new songs really suck and a re an insult to the depht achieved in previous years. I think that if they don't have anything new to say, there are better off silent. The graphic artwort of the albums can be superb, but that doesn't improve the band's musical content. It is the same legacy of Mr. Waters in a different fancy package. What's next? Pink Floyd unplugged?"
1,Horrible Camera,"My daughter received this camera as a gift. Too bad a gift receipt wasn't included, because I definitely would have returned it on Day 1. The camera constantly freezes, drains its batteries, and the screen resolution is of horrible quality, where you can't even tell what the image is. I did not print any pictures, so I cannot speak to that, but please do not buy this camera. You're better off buying a cheap adult digital camera."
2,Not Compatible With Windows Vista,"I purchased 2 of these for my kids for Christmas. They looked great in the store, they worked fine when we opened them. We have not had any problems with losing pictures or poor battery life. Our problem is that the software is not compatible with Windows Vista, so we have no way to get the pictures off the camera. Crayola Customer support was terrible, the only thing they could tell me was to return the cameras. Unfortunately, that is not possible because I bought them before Thanksgiving and wrapped them for Christmas. Very disappointing!"
1,Do not buy this camera,My son got this camera as a gift. It took about 3 pictures and then died. We changed the batteries several times but the camera would not restart. Do not buy this camera. My son would have better off just using my husband's old digital camera.
1,Just Awful!,"Please, don't waste your money on this camera...it is absolutely the worst!The lcd viewer is worthless and the pictures are just terrible....grainy, blurry, poor color....Crayola did not do their homework on this product. (I guess neither did I!)"
4,It's OK,"I got this for my daughter since I'd rather not have her playing with my nice expensive camera. She loves it. It has few buttons, so it's easy to learn to use. I didn't install the software yet, she hasn't noticed. I like that the batteries and SD card slot are secured from tiny hands just pulling them out, but the tiny screws were a pain. At least I had a small screwdriver handy. I like that it has an SD card and not just internal memory. One big drawback is the flash. It whitewashes everything almost unrecognizable. And it takes a few seconds between pushing the shutter button and when it flashes or takes a picture. At first this resulted in a lot of blurry pictures. Now that my daughter has gotten the hang of it though, it's better. The display screen is small and blurry and fairly useless, but my daughter loves it anyway. I'd give it a 2, but my daughter would give it a 5, so I gave it a 4, since it's her camera after all."
1,Don't Buy,"This camera is terrible. If your child has any interest in photography this product will eliminate it. It has pictures that are always out of focus and blurry. Batteries die, so do your fuzzy pictures. Zero stars should be the actual rating."
2,disappointing,"This was great for my 4 yr old...at first. But every-time we turned it off and put it away for more than an hour the batteries would be dead the next time we tried to use it. I changed the batteries out multiple times but it continued to do the same thing. we don't need anything snazzy, just something that flashes, shows some kind of image and doesn't eat through batteries!"
1,Waste of Money. Great colorful paperweight,My mother purchased this camera for a christmas gift for my 5 year old daughter. we were very excited since our duaghter likes to use our more expensive camera to take pictures constantly. She got to use it for about 30 minutes and it died on us. The batteries were brand new. None of our computers will recognize that the camea is plugged into the usb port so we cant even upload the pics she got to take. I feel bad that my mom wasted her money and our daughter is a bit disappointed that she didnt get a camera for christmas like she was hoping.
1,frustrated mom,"this is actually the second camera we bought as a Christmas gift as the original one was defective out of the package and we were able to return it and replace it at the store. The replacement one is just as awful as the first. It only worked the first two times, then quit working altogether. When I e-mailed the company (as directed on the packaging) to inquire about the warranty and repair instructions, I was given the run-around and told they cannot honor a warranty if you don't hang on to the receipt. Who hangs on to a receipt for a year as the warranty promises?! It is bad enough for a company to knowingly put out such a lousy product, but to market it to children is simply terrible. I'll never buy anything from them again. To give this product a star at all is too much!"
1,Had trouble downloading photos to computer,"This was a gift for my 5 1/2 year old. I agree with all about the view screen. Horrible quality. My daughter thought the pictures looked bad and deleted them. She loved taking photos and deleting them, kind of like a video game for her. Annoying sounds too each time you scroll through the photos or delete from the camera.I tried to download the photos after properly installing the software, but got a failure when opening the DCIM folder. Call customer support they said I needed to use a SD card to download photos to the computer. This is not what is described in the packgage. Customer support was to send me a fix for Vista, mine is 32 bit not 64 bit. Never received it."
1,Thumb down,"I bought it as a Christmas gift to my grandson. At first, it had problem to turn on. Two days and less than a dozen pictures later, it died. What a piece of junk!"
1,Electronic Junk,"If you want a ~$40 piece of junk to contribute to a landfill, go ahead and buy this. Each of my kids got one for Christmas(that is 2 DEAD units). 1 did not work out of the box the other worked for 1 week and died. Not sure how the pictures look as both died before getting around to install the software. The LCD is terrible; Everything on it looks like a blob. Hopefully someone files a class action lawsuit against Crayola and at least the kids will get something out of the gifts. Seriously Crayola you need to pull this piece of junk off the market. It is a big name on an cheap low low low budget imported piece of .... Bottom line: AVOID!"
5,"Truthful, Educational and Extraordinary","This could be the first book written, which describes in great informative detail, events in the modern history of Iraq. It is written from a unbiased witness who is simply displaying with an honest and unobjective view, the misuse of power and obvious consequences of hate and revenge. It will become the book which all turn to as an acurate recording of historic facts."
5,HANSON ROCKS!!!!,"I've boughten all Hanson's CD and have loved all of them. ""Underneath"" is amazing. Hanson have grown so much. I love ""Broken Angel,"" wow, what a great song. Hanson is going to be around for a long time. Their music is life changing, I recommand this CD to anyone."
5,People need to revisit who Hanson really is!,"I love this cd and look forward to Hanson's follow up cd. Many people I know don't know Hanson beyond the MMMMbog phase, but that was nearly 10 years ago and these ""men"" have grown into fine musicians. Even better, they are geunine and the music comes from a pure place, not a bunch of angry twisted ramblings. They have soul and great energy and their songs are very catchy. I only hope people look beyond their pop bumble gum phase and give them the respect they wholeheartedly deserve."
2,just aight,these Guys can Play&write alright but there isn't anything on this album that moves me.truth be told right about now I'd like to Hear them covering Brian Wilson's Catelog.alot of these Tracks remind me of something Clay Aiken or the Band Train might be doing.safe middle of the Road material that might have a decent track or two but on a whole you forget it as soon as you eject the music out your player.good to see them still hanging around though.
4,what?!,Now I know i did 4 stars and it needs it. but wait what about the feel good music like in MON i mean even Zac himself said'' I think every one is tired being sad''. So then I didn't think they would have songs like misery and broken angel. But they did they have grown up but for some things i think that they are just trying to make other's like them. I mean now come on they are drinking and smokeing. and Zac's 18 but oh well what can I do but hanson if you ever read this you guys rock big time but what you have done is not what i want to do with my life but that's your life so i live my life the way i want but you can do what ever:)anyway you guys rock big time bye:)
1,yech,i can't stand taylor's voice..i'm confused why people think he can sing...when in most songs you can't even make out the lyrics of what he's singin..the one thing that irritates me most is when taylor does this ridiculous curves(?).. with his voice..yech..hansons 15 min is over..period
1,Pubescent Loosers,"Uh? How can you like this? I thought they were dead! M-bup or whatever it was called was bad enough, now theyre back, to get more money from little girls.This CD should have a warning, not explicit lyrics but wanky music."
1,miserable,This CD is absolutely miserable. Anyone who listens to this and thinks it is good has no taste. Actually they do have taste. Taste for junk. Don't even think of wasting your money on this garbage. You have been warned.
4,Really good followup. . . obvious growth as a band,"Currently listening to the new album. And I'm really impressed. They seem to have really progressed as far as their musical talent goes. . it's really the best i've ever heard them. And granted some people won't give it a chance. . . because it's ""hanson"". But they are missing out. . . because this CD IS good, no if ands or buts about it."
4,great CD,A great CD from Hanson!!! The best songs are Penny and Me and Strong Enough to Break by far!! If you love Hanson then this is a must have!
5,I LOVE ZAC HANSON!!! HE IS SUCH A HOTTIE!,This CD is amazing!!! I have been following Hanson ever since 3 Car Garage and they have only gotten better over the years! *and zac has gotten hotter!!!* Oh- and plus 2 out of the three of them have finally cute their hair!
3,alright for die-hard hanson fans only...,"As a child of the boyband era... I started out loving BSB who came out after Hanson... then Hanson's 2nd album was edgier and showed more of a rock side but expressed a lot of emotions as well... I was in love with songs such as ""if only"" and ""runaway run"" they were fun and I could listen to them no matter what mood I was in. ""Penny and me"" is a song that I think is hands down amazing. Taylor Hanson shows off his vocals and his fun personality... however, I am not really able to appreciate many of the other songs... besides one... I think it is because Hanson didn't really have an audience in mind... I'm sure die-hard hanson fans would buy the album anyways, so Hanson didn't really have much to worry about and decided to experiment with reinvention in this album... preview the entire album before buying..."
4,get over your homophobia & buy it- good music,"i am a 27 year old male who has been an active musician since i was 12 years old, i dig good original music: i.e.- led zeppelin, pink floyd, the beatles, radiohead,lenny kravitz- favorite new bands are the mars volta & the secret machines. i bought the new hanson album because i knew they were decent musicians as teens & was curious to see how they had evolved. this is a good album. if you are into good, thoughtful music such as coldplay, travis, even the beatles- you will like ""underneath"". their biggest sales hurdle will be males around my age who wouldn't be caught dead with a hanson record. get over it guys, this is a real band. well-written songs with nice hooks & melodies- brilliantly arranged numbers such as ""broken angel"" & ""crazy/beautiful"" among many others. maybe one or two songs that are a little too poppy for my taste, otherwise a good album."
5,I really like this CD,I really like this CD. I am not a teenager. I am telling you this so that the readers of this review do not assume that only teenagers like this CD. It would be extremely unfair to think that only young people like Hanson's music.This group has grown and mature. Their music is great to listen while you have a long ride in your car; say on the way to work. I really like 'Penny & Me' and 'Lost'. But I truly like the entire CD.I hope you enjoy this CD as much as I did.
5,hanson=amazing!,"after 4 years of waiting, i finaly have my hands on the new cd from hanson and all i can say is amazing! the cd is so wonderful.the songs have good beats and lyrics to them. the cd shows how hanson has grown over these past 4 years out of the lime light. their long awaited cd is so amazing and everyone should own a copy!"
5,Awsome,"this is awsome! it's different from the first 3, but i personally think it's the best. they have grown up!"
3,good cd,"Reccomended tracks: Strong Enough to Break,Dancing in the Wind, Penny and Me, Lost WithoutEach Other, Deeper, Crazy Beautiful, Hey,Get Up and Go"
5,100% RECCOMEND!,"I have just a few things to say.This album is just a great collection of music by Hanson, the songs are all catchy and have meaning to them. People don't realize the crap that hanson had to go through to make this album! SO atleast give them a chance. But I mean, that really shouldnt get in the way of it, with this just being an OUTSTANDING record by itself! Hanson really deserves to be in the spotlight again. It's just those people who are bringing them down who aren't mature enough to say that they were wrong about Hanson at first, and that Hanson is growing into mature adult rockers! HANSON IS REAL!"
5,An Incredible Comeback,"I would never have guessed that the best album of 2004 would come from Hanson. A smart move to create their own label, but better than that is the music featured on ""Underneath"". The music is catchy and beautiful as well as entertaining and good for head bopping. It's the kind of music you have playing in your car. Best tracks: Lost Without Each Other and Believe. The Japanese version is almost worth buying for its extra tracks- I Almost Care and Dream Girl. This version comes with a DVD as well as the album and amazon.com offers a fair price."
4,Very Well Done,"I was not a fan of Hanson back in their days of ""Mmmbop"" among other teeny bopper pop tunes, but this album is extremely well done and full of beautiful, poetic lyrics and strong vocals. I highly recommend it."
5,A very good CD,I will amit that I liked Hanson and then in 2000 I stopped liking them. It didn't help by having eveyone making fun of them. When I saw them on TRL a couple of weeks ago I was like is that Hanson? It can't be they look so good and a lot older. I got their cd and fell in love with it. It is so wonderful. I love when groups can play their own music and now they have total control of their life. Buy this cd they sound so different from Middle of Nowhere. They have such a grown-up sound and they have grown-up. Give them another chance!
3,A Hymn To Not Fitting In,"A few of the characters were intriguing in this slow-paced book, but I thought it was a cop-out to end it with the child, Icy Sparks, learning that the only place misfits belong, like Icy with her tics and the obese Miss Emma, is at church. That cheapened the whole read into a conversion attempt."
5,A wonderful story with a fabulous reader.,"A friend gave me this book to listen to. A good reader will really make or break a story and this one is wonderful. With al her different voices, she really brings the story to life. It's a beautiful story to listen to. Icy sparks, a young girl who people think is just crazy, has been undiagnosed wiht tourette's syndrome. Your hear the stories of her frustrations as she explores her disease and learns to live through it. A good mix of sadness and hapiness."
3,It ran out of gas at the end,"I won't rehash the plot of this novel. I enjoyed the book immensely in the beginning, but my enthusiasm faded as I read on. The book's ending was tremendously disappointing. It was almost as though the author didn't know what to do with Icy and simply decided to stop writing. The epilogue explaining Icy's understanding of her disorder and how she came to terms with it did not befit the rest of the book; it was too simple, too easy."
1,I don't get it.,"... I wish I'd read the editorial reviews before I bought it. And because it is now an Oprah pick, I got the book out and wasted valuable time reading it, (trying to) again. It is a boring, distasteful read. I finished it because I couldn't believe a book that had been accepted for publication could be as bad as I thought, so therefore, it must, I reasoned, get better. It never did. At first I thought it must have started out as a case study of Tourettes and then someone had the bad idea to fictionalize it. Then I quit trying to characterize it. I don't know whether this book helps or hurts victims of Tourettes. The only person I ever knew with Tourettes was nothing like Icy Sparks -- he definitely lacked her rage (which was about the only real emotion the writer managed to convey in the whole book)."
1,Coming of age...,"This book claims to be about an tourette child and tempts the reader by offering insight into her life. What this novel really is is a coming of age novel of the blandest outline. Any depth of discovery into tourettes is brief and repetitive.The closing chapters were of the utmost disappointment. Rather than having the character find a therapist competent enough to diagnose the illness the author introduces the church and through Icy's new faith she musters the strength to persevere and the acceptance she has long desired.Though I don't doubt the power of faith, I think it demonstrates a lack of research on the author's behalf. People with psychological disorders have been failing at this approach for centuries."
3,not impressed,"The writer definitely knows her craft. She is capable of some amazing descriptions and gives the subject of a young girl with Tourette's syndrome a poetic touch. But the characters are almost all stereotypes, and the understanding shown toward the girl seems too good to be true for the time and place the book is set in. Of course, she does meet her share of mockery, but those who love her achieve an unnatural state of acceptance and peace - yes, they should in an ideal world, but this is a time where no info on Tourette's was available.While it is possible to tell a story by painting everything in primary colors, the reader eventually begins to long for some shades of gray. So it was here."
4,I loved Icy Sparks,This was a great read and a great story. You find yourself living her life with her. I highly recommend this book for a happy reading experience.
2,Something Missing,"I know I'm in the minority but I found it a struggle to get through this book. Not because of the subject matter, which could have been compelling, but because the writing, to me, seemed to get in the way of the storytelling. While I admired the author's obvious talent, it felt at times like wading through a writer's showcase rather than following a story line. It reminded me of some of the stuff I read (and wrote) in a college fiction writing class. A short story can bear the weight of descriptive detail, metaphor and imagery. I'm not so sure a novel can sustain its momentum with such heavy handed use of same. To me it felt as though the author was just a bit too immersed in exploring her gifts at the story's expense. Had an editor trimmed just a bit of the descriptive meandering, it would have made a huge difference."
3,Being different,"The story begins with a telling description of the backwoods ideas and folklore that permeate rural America.I think the author delivered a genuine homespun observation of the coolness that sometimes resides in rural areas. It was chilling on many levels as teachers, doctors and family members ignored this young girl struggling and suffering with a disease without a name. She felt shameful and yet overcame the obsticales by becoming resourceful with others who had been outcasted by this community. I felt compelled to read on and was taken back by the simplicity of the town people who did not care to help this young girl."
3,good but,i liked the stroy however i dont think it protrayed tourettes in the most accurate way. however the story was good and you really felt for icy so i still recomend. i would just warn pepole about the tourette descrption.
2,WHAT HAPPENED?,"I liked the book (lots of good insight and determination on behalf of the unfortunate main character) until all of a sudden, this religious ending comes along. You have to suspend belief that she sees her dead grandfather; and then all of a sudden she gets into it all????? MALARKY! I can't believe a seemingly intelligently written book thoughout could all of a sudden turn into what it did. I think the Epilogue was good; perhaps if only that was used as the end, I would be less disappointed. What a shame!"
3,Good until the last three chapters...,"I loved this book down to the last three chapters. I read it in two days because I just couldn't put it down. The characters are so real. The story is one that most anyone can relate to. Intolerance. Not fitting in. Trying to find meaning in your world. But the ending seems to try to put a perfect little bow on an imperfect story. The author did such a wonderful job creating believable, lovable, real characters. People who could really exist and who had realistic problems.I just felt like the last three chapters pulled me into a strange time warp. The rest of the book doesn't fly through time so quickly. The end makes characters change too rapidly. And the sudden introduction of religion along with the bible quotes and hymn lyrics seemed foreign."
1,Who Is She Kidding?,"As the mother of a ""special"" child living in a small town in Virginia, I thought this might be a good fit. I believed that there might be some insight into what my son and other children plagued by compulsions and tics experience and how they and other come to terms with that experience. But that is not it at all. This novel turns the very serious and complex job of supressing one's instincts into pablum. Bad people are just stupid and closed-minded. Salvation comes from simply loving oneself. Oh, Icy, if it were only that easy.Save yourself the trouble. If you are really interesting in the subject, meet someone with Tourette's, talk to them about the difficulty of loving it. Heck, if you're really interested, why don't you go to a tent revival and see if Jesus tells people to just accept themselves. I don't know about that but I do think that this novel was silly and maudlin and mystical when it could have been insightful."
5,A delightful story of being different.,"Hats off to the author! A well written, descriptive story of a young girl who was ""different"", a sharing of her trials, her joys and her sorrows. During this period of time in Appalachia,and probably anyplace else, it was difficult to be different and to be singled out, as the author has well expressed. A book that makes us look within ourselves and reminds us of people we knew and know today who may seems different. It is a reminder that human kindness can be the greatest factor influencing someone's life. This was a joy to read and I am thankful to the author for being able to share this with us."
4,Seeing the Truth About a Young Girl,"I really enjoy reading this book that had a real meaning to it that could raise many people's self-esteem. It was a very easy book to read. There are many people who try to hide certain traits about themselves. Reading this, you will realize you are no different from anybody else. Also you will reconize that there are many people out in the world that have many of the same kind of problems as you may. I recommend this book to everyone. Written from a child's point of view, you get to see how us kids feel and the emotions we have against many situations. To many times, we try to kide the real us from people due to being afraid of what others may say... you can't judge someone by the way they look, or some traits they have. The real them is the only thing that matters."
2,Not Up to Oprah's Usual Picks.....,"Without fail I have enjoyed Oprah's choices and I purchase each as soon as they are announced. This is one I wish I had borrowed. The Appalachian setting provides a backdrop for the story of Icy who is afflicted with an unknown malady. We see her struggles with ""croaking"", eye popping, and the like as she grows up in a small community. This had the potential of a great story, but the plot lost me completely as Icy was continuously mistreated by the townspeople and teachers. I fail to believe that this many people could so badly treat anyone. Eventually even the Tourette's syndrome became hard to believe. The reader is led to understand that Icy could control her symptoms and that all her symptoms came over her at one time, lasting for an hour. Is this really how Tourette's inflicts itself? I have to agree with People magazine's review of this book. It seems to follow a ""Pick me"" formula to become an Oprah book - without the normal great story line."
3,Icy Sparks lacks Sparky Ending,I loved the book until the end. No details on how she was diagnosed with Tourettes - just that it was diagnosed. So much wonderful detail in the beginning and middle...so flat at the end. I don't recommend this book.
3,"Starts off well, finishes with a fizzle","This was a pleasant, sweet book about Icy Sparks, an endearing young girl with undiagnosed Tourette's syndrome. We read the narrative (written by her looking back as an adult) as she struggles with what her disease does to her life.The writing style is easy to read, although I found myself wishing that the author would have gone a bit deeper into the minds of her characters - I sensed that she had the potential to do so, but didn't for some reason, and I was left unsatisfied.The last 20 or so pages are almost comical. They really seem as if they were written by someone else, and if not for them my rating and impression of the book would be quite a bit higher. Instead of being left with the warm fuzzies that the rest of the nice (if too simplistic) story gave me, I closed the last page, thinking ""HUH?!"" Overall, I still recommend it as a quick, light read."
3,Disappointing...,"Icy Sparks is the story of a young girl in rural Kentucky, afflicted with Tourette's syndrome. However, in the backwoods where Icy lives, her occasional outbursts of croaks and tics are simply labled as crazy, which lands Icy in a mental hospital at the tender age of 10. While this book was touching at times, the last few chapters seemed to take a strange twist and almost completely abandon Icy's condition and treat it as if Tourette's is just a condition that can be controlled by mind-over-matter. What started out as a wonderful novel which could have truly given insight into the world of Tourette's syndrome, ended in great disappointment. It appeared as if the author just wanted to bring the book to a quick finish and used religion as a quick panacea to cured what ailed Icy."
2,Blindsided by the church,"A seemingly unrelatable child struggling with an undiagnosed case of Tourette's in a remote mountain town has an amazing spirit that enraptured me as a reader. The people that float into her life throughout the book seem to feel the same way. I enjoyed it.275 pages later? BAM! Her now diagnosed Tourette's is a gift from God, and her seemingly agnostic grandparents and herself have found Jesus, and the world is good. It was like watching a news segment that starts with Brian Williams and ends with Bill O'Reilly. The stark contrast and abrupt shift was unwelcome, at best."
2,Terrible,"This book was just OK until the end when it turned awful. Icy goes to a revival and things take a weird religious turn. Either the author has a religious agenda or she came up with that ending just to get the book done. I had to MAKE myself finish it after that. I can't believe all of the good ratings on this book. This is the second book in Oprah's Book Club that I found awful and I'm just not willing to sit through another one of her bad picks. Seriously, don't waste your time with terrible book."
2,Lack of reserach,"Not much research had been done by the writer part with regards to Tourette syndrome. It was briefly discussed in this book. I could not helped myself from ommiting the last few chapters of the book.It seems to me that the writer had directed all his/her attention in discussing chapters and chapters on how the church services had helped icy sparks in her recovering process. Had this amount of effort being directed on the topic on ""Tourette syndrome"", it would be definately be a much better book to invest your time and money on."
2,Okay Book with Horrible Ending,"I agree with Heather. I forced myself to get through this book, mostly because once I start one, I hate to end it without finishing it. The characters in this book were ""okay"" but everything seemed so overdramatized and quite frankly the most touching character was Patanni, in my opinion. I kept going through the book hoping for at least a great ending to tie it all up and make it worth it, but alas I was subjected to three chapters of bible beating and ""Praise the Lord Jesus...."" eighty thousand times. Plus, I think I know the words to every Christian hymn, and I'm not even Christian! Just a highly disappointing ending, one that left me feeling even more disconnected from the main character. Rent it from the library."
3,Another Good Pick from Oprah,"I always find the novels that Oprah picks much more diverse than my average reading choices. This was yet, another good read and pick from Oprah. I enjoyed the novel throughly, however, the ending was lacking. All throughout the book it was strong- telling the story of Icy and then at the final climax you get a two-page epilogue of where she is now- wrapping it up in a pretty package. It was good till the end, and then strongly disappointing!"
3,"Enjoyed the first half, not the last.","I chose this book based on Oprah's recommendation, and I am wondering if she read the entire book. I found the first half of this book to be completely engaging. Rubio does a wonderful job creating the rural setting and developing her characters. Icy's torment and the reactions by the various kind and not so kind people in her life are realistic and beautifully expressed by Rubio. Beginning with the Christmas pageant at the state hospital and continuing until the last page, however, the story became unbearably schmaltzy and saccharine. I felt as if a lesser author had taken over, turning the book into an icky sweet Hallmark card. Rubio wraps everything up in ""pretty little bows"" in the most insipid way. When Oprah had her panel of readers on to review the book, she mentioned that this was the only book she had ever recommended that received no negative comments. I find that hard to believe."
2,I Felt Icy Cold,"For some reason I could not connect. The story did not seem real to me. Even though I felt sorry for Icy, I had a difficult time with the story. I just finished 'Sing Me A Bawdy Song,' a book that make me cry and made me laugh. It flowed and I really connected with the characters. I did not like the ending of Icy and it made me feel are though reading the book was a waste of time."
4,Icy Sparks,"I fell in love with Icy Sparks and her loving family. Icy represents a part in all of us that sometimes just cannot help doing what we know is wrong and yet loving ourselves regardless. The reader is a witness to her disorder, which at the time, doctors did not how to treat. Lessons of life for all of us are inscribed in this masterful novel."
3,She turned out to be nice,"I actually bought this book on the strength and reputation of being recommended in Oprah's book club. It is an interesting story, but somehow it is not written quite tightly. The main character Icy starts out as an uncontrollable kid, with her tantrums and all. But then she ends up being a nice girl in the end, based on her own epilogue of sorts. The story was narrated by Icy herself. Until now I am quite puzzled how this came to be. Admittedly, this is actually a nice story though."
2,a big let down,"i bought this book because it was one of oprahs book club recommendation,although it's a small book it took me over a week to read it, it justed didn't hold my interest, it seemed to drag on and on. i just don't feel like i came away with anything, a sad story it's true but that's about the extent of the book."
3,Ends in disappointment...,"I really loved the begining.. started off really emotional. It was actually very good at detailing the way Icy Sparks felt. It made me able to see things from the eyes of someone who felt an outcast. But in the middle, i found her stay at the hospital too long and pointless. Then all of a sudden, she leaves even thought they did not help her one bit. She stuggles some more after going home. Then all of a sudden, as if the author got tired of writing, the story just wrapped up and finished. I thought is was unrealiztic to have her all of a sudden heal emotionally and mentally after going to a revival. She realize that people cared about her even though that fact was obvious throughout the book. She didnt need a revival to tell her that. I was expecting her to get better by some really dramatic experience. Yea, i really felt the ending was disappointing. But over, the book is decent...not too bad..."
2,Not what I expected.,"I found this on a bargain rack and was surprised to see it was an Oprah's book club pick. I was excited to find it so cheap. Having only read one Oprah's book club pick (Wally Lamb's She's Come Undone, which was excellent), I guess I wasn't well informed. The reader for the book was pretty awful, and the dialogue is unconvincing at best and unbelievable at worst. The story is disjointed, with characters popping in and out at random and the plot is very predictable. I only give it two stars because as an audio book, it was mildly interesting. I would have never stuck it out in paperback."
2,I had to force myself to finish reading this,"I bought this book before a week-long vacation and had to force myself to read it. I thought it was absolutely miserable. I felt no compassion whatsoever for the main character. I normally like memoir-type or first-person point of view books, but Icy Sparks did not interest me whatsoever. I wasn't fond of the writing style. This book proved to me that you can slap an Oprah's Book Club label on any garbage, but it doesn't make it worth reading!"
5,Heartbreaking and Hilarious,"Gwyn Hyman Rubio's ""Icy Sparks"" is an exceptional book. She has created an unforgettable character in Icy -- a young girl suffering from Tourette's syndrome. Set in rural Kentucky during the late 1950s and early 1960s, the reader is consistently challenged to question their response to the incidents and situations that occur in this novel.The book is so rich in detail that the reader is often left feeling as though they have actually witnessed one of Icy's outbursts. The question is -- from which point of view? One of Gwyn Hyman Rubio's strongest assets is her ability to convey the shock and horror of those around Icy as she ""jerks"" and ""croaks,"" while at the same time describe Icy's self-hatred of the inablity to control her body.In the end, this book is not simply about Tourrette's syndrome. It is about human igonrance, fear and tolerance. I would highly recommend it to anyone."
1,ICY SPARKS DID NOT CREATE SPARKS,"Read the Amazon.com and Kirkus Review book reviews before you consider purchasing this title. I did not find Icy winsome or interesting and the church revival meeting, where Icy encounters Jesus, and has an ""epiphany"" about loving herself was just too much. I think the book had potential, but I was disappointed not to see it realized. I would NOT recommend this novel."
4,Wonderful Book,I loved Icy Sparks - the book and the character. If anyone has ever felt out of place while growing up - you will certainly be able to relate to Icy. I was cheering her on to victory over those who constantly tortured her. I found this book a very fast read and must say I miss Icy now that I have finished the book.
2,Dragggggggggs On,"This book was too slow. The chapters needed to be more inviting, that is, into the life of Icy Sparks. Even though the author does give some good detail into the mind of Icy, it still lacked alot. It took me longer to read this novel then others, it just didn't excite me. The end was a disappointment. The only thing I did enjoy, was the character of Icy's friend, ""Miss Emily""."
2,This book was not a page turner.,"I bought this book in an attempt to read more. And, generally Ienjoyed the books from Oprah's book club (the bluest eye, black and blue, she comes undone, and now icy sparks). However, this book was very slow paced and bored me at times. I thought that it was way too sentimental and I don't believe I learned anything about Tourette's Syndrome that didn't already know. I especially despised the over religious ending and wondered where it came from and why did it have to continue so long. It took me a couple of weeks to finish this book and I wished I had saved my money and borrowed it from the public library.However, I did enjoy Icy's interaction with Peavy Lawson. And there were some funny aspects concerning Mrs. Stilton and Wilma the evil nurse aide. I was thankful that the book was only 300 pages long so that is another positive for Icy Sparks. Lastly, borrow this book DON'T buy."
2,"A Bit Lacking In ""Real"" Appalachia","This story was very touching and warm. The writer does an excellent job of putting us in poor Icy's seat in the classroom and on our knees beside her in the cellar. However, I was disappointed in her inability to capture the real heart and language of rural Appalachia. The writer puts words in the mouths of these folk that could only come from an outsider. I realize that the dialect would be incredibly difficult to write (or read for that matter). Yet, the writing drifts in and out of the dialect in such a distracting way that it merits mention. The words, stories, expressions and characters of the natives of the rural Kentucky Appalachian Mountains are remarkably colorful and deserve equal attention as whatever story they are being used to tell."
3,Enjoyable Characters....3 1/2 stars.,"Icy Sparks is a story about a girl that is inflicted with Tourettes syndrome. I really liked the most of the people in this book, especially Icy herself, she was very likable and funny and I could really feel for her. Her grandparents were very supportive, even in a time when Tourettes syndrome was really not understood. It covers her life from a little girl to a young woman. It describes the illness very well and is quite fascinating.What was disappointing is that there was no real answers of how to deal with the disease, Icy basically hid in her home and stayed away from public life. The other BIG disappointment was how the book was wrapped up, (I can't give it away)but to me it was hard to believe. But give it a try it was very entertaining and was sometimes, quite engrossing. You may like the ending better much better than I did!"
4,I liked it more than most,"I liked this book more than some of the other readers. I'm not going to reveiw the plot because that's been done. True, it was kind of slow-moving, but I was not at all bored with the story. The point wasn't how it ended, but the journey of how she got there. During a time when disorders such as this were virtually unknown and no one knew of a treatment or medication, it's amazing that Icy was able to survive at all. Under normal circumstances, such a person would have been completely ostrasized. I was pleased that she was surrounded by one or two understanding, loving, supportive people who didn't try to force her to be what she wasn't or try to make her control what she couldn't control. I think the lesson here is that love, rather than criticism and discipline, helps us to overcome even the most insurmountable obstacles."
3,Not so great!,"I would have expected a bit more, kind of dragged through the middle. I lost interest towards the end. Wouldn't recommend."
2,"Dag Nabit, this one didn't do it for me","Read this on vacaction - it was an OK read. I learned more about a disorder that for some reason we didn't study much in psychology courses (maybe it was too new when I was in college). I had a little trouble connecting with the characters and culture the author tried to represent. I typically enjoy books that expose me to different dialects and cultures. I do like southern novels but some drive me crazy (like the Ya Ya Sisterhood variety). This one, ""dag nabit"", just didn't do it for me. I would give it a 2.5 if amazon would allow half stars."
2,I was rather disappointed ....,This book definitely left me wanting ... wanting a better plot and certainly a more satisfying ending. I liked the author's 'style' but the this book was not worth the [money]..paperbacks are far to [pricey] these days!
5,Icy Sparks,"This has been one of the best books I have ever read! Gwyn Hyman Rubio has now been added to my list of ""Favorite Authors!"""
1,Quit on page #50,I hate it when a book is so bad that you just can't read another page. I felt like this book was going to get somewhere but it was too boring to try to get to that point.
2,Icy Sparks,"I didn't even finish this book because I found it too boring. Maybe if I would have kept reading it would have picked up a little, but I wasn't feeling patient enough. I wouldn't exactly reccomend this book."
2,Watery Fizzles-might be more apt,"Interesting premise but poorly written with a weakly executed plot. Yet another addition to the southern-poetry of rural- poverty genre; this one doesn't work as well as others. At times the novel seemed like an excuse for Ms. Rubio to trot out her zingy one-liners--I returned the book to the library so I can't provide any actual examples. An easy enough read--so if you're curious about the story go ahead and give it a go, just don't expect anything spectacular."
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed reading Icy Sparks and thought she was an adorable character. I am a teacher, so have had few experiences with TS. The only thing that disappointed me about this book was the ending--I thought the author spent too much time with the religion aspect of the story. Overall, I did enjoy this book."
4,Great for Teenagers!,"Icy Sparks was great. I am a 14 year old girl who likes to read ""adult"" books because ""teenage"" book are not interesting. Icy Sparks taught me that it doesn't matter what I look like or what I do. A must for teenage girls!"
1,"Good start, dull middle, contrived ending","I have to agree with the many readers who wrote that the book completely loses steam and then comes to an abrupt and unrealistic ending. The initial descriptions of the oncoming Tourette's, rendered in Icy's voice, are good. Unfortunately, the dialog is not very compelling and after we meet the rest of Icy's world, the book becomes tedious. And the ending makes no sense at all."
1,agh.,"wow. oprah's never let me down before, but she has with 'icy sparks'. it started off slow, but i kept on reading, thinking it was going to pick up. it never did. dont waste your time reading this one."
1,Just Plain Terrible,"This is one of the worst books that I have ever read. I should have quit after the first few chapters, but kept thinking that it might get better. Don't bother with this book."
2,second half - what a bore!,"The first part of the book was very interesting...but, the second half was too boring for me to finish."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"On the surface, this novel brings you into the twitching and croaking body of a girl suffering Tourette Syndrome, but the book's real magic is its power to actually induce narcolepsy."
3,entertaining,"Ms Rubio told Icy Spark's story and who are we to change it according to our understanding? Growing up in a small eastern Ky town, I have known many Icy Sparks. Her story caused me to reflect on my youth and the lonely, tortured lives of many of my (different) school mates. Yes, I believe from experience that children do have what one critic called mature thoughts when they are faced with abusive parents, teachers or peers.This novel was Ms Rubios first and I look forward to her next endeavor."
2,Forgettable,"This book started off on a good note and was interesting for the first 20 - 30 pages or so. After that, it seemed to merely be an attempt by Rubio to show that she could write descriptively, ad infinitum, without contributing anything to a real plot. Icy's story became boring quickly. Many of the characters Rubio introduced served little purpose and simple events were granted far more description than warranted. Some of those events were valueless to the story.The aim of the book, (exploring Tourette's Syndrome) missed its mark. Icy Sparks is a forgettable character as were most of the characters in this story. Peppering a story with multiple characters for the sake of merely having a large cast does not serve the reader except to confuse and frustrate.However, since this was Rubio's first attempt, I intend to read more by her in the hope that she's honed her craft. She certainly displays a strong potential to be a very good author."
4,Great!,"I would recommend the book Icy Sparks to anyone over age 13. It's a compelling book that's both sad and comical at the same time. I would only recommend it to a little bit more mature audience because it tends to use foal language. The author Gwyn Hyman Rubio has awesome writing technique that keeps you interested the whole time, except maybe the beginning. When Icy Sparks, the fictional little girl the book is written about, is first being introduced to us it gets a bit confusing and it's easy to get lost in all the characters. The10 yr old Icy Sparks learns that people can be cruel. Before she discovers how to control the tics and cussing and eye popping, she hides it from her grandparents by letting loose in the cellar. She soon finds out that there is hope for people who are different through going to Bluegrass State Hospital and her best friend Miss Emily."
1,Senseless babble,"A completely redundant portrayal of a very uninteresting girl. I kept waiting for it to get ""good"" and it just never happens. The story goes in circles. Don't let all of the good reviews on the cover fool you, this book is a flop. You are wrong Oprah."
2,What a disappointment.,"This book is what I would describe as a ""squirmy"" read. It made me very uncomfortable. I had almost no sympathy for the main character. It sort of reminded me of ""She's Come Undone"". In both books, the main character was so miserable and bitter it was hard to feel bad for her. I think L.A. Law did a much better job portraying Tourette's. I felt bad for that guy."
3,Lessons Learned in Life,"The character Icy Sparks brought tears and laughter as I rooted for her to overcome many insecurities. Through Icy, Mantanni and Pantanni's characters, the author taught lessons about selfishness, judgment, vanity, imperfection, acceptance, jealousy, self-esteem and most importantly a lesson about LOVE. The characters were developed so well that I could feel Icy's need for acceptance. People are so cruel and judgmental that I feared for Icy and her possible loss of her closest relatives and friends. I thought if she lost them, she'd be stuck in those back woods forever.The ending however, was disappointing because of the preachy sermon that was used to wrap up the story. Surely, there had to be a better way to deliver the message of accepting God. I could have read a T.D. Jakes self-help novel if I wanted to hear a long sermon."
2,"Just ""OK"" for me.","This is the first novel I have read in about 15 years. I am really not into reading novels. I prefer non-fiction, however I was going on vacation and chose this book to read as a time filler. It was interesting but very long winded and too much detail in some of the chapters. I found myself skimming through to get to the relevent parts. I could have stopped reading it in the last few chapters and not even wondered how it ended. Not what I would call a ""can't put it down"" book. I did finish it and felt glad to be done with it. I really cannot recommend."
3,Icy Sparks,"This is a poor southern story focusing on a young girl named Icy Sparks, who has various physical and social problems while growing up... She is raised by her grandparents because her mother died when she was very young. As a youngster, Icy has unusual outbursts that cause her to be ostracized by the people in the small southern town where she is raised. To make matters worse, she has very few friends, except for Miss Emily. Miss Emily is an obese old maid who gives her advice on life and encourages her to go to college.The story centers on Icy's thoughts and perspectives and in the end teaches a lesson to all of us on overcoming and not giving up. The plot, though interesting and full of great description, is slow and somewhat boring."
3,Tourette's Syndrome revealed,"I have never read a book that deals with Tourette's so I don't know if the author did a good job or not. She wrote characters that are fairly well-developed but who don't seems to have a lot of depth and dimension. I can't say that I liked this book. About half way through it became repetitive and seemed to lose its forward movement. As a book that opens one's experience to Tourette's, it probably succeeds, but it doesn't create a lot of sympathy for the heroine who suffers from this syndrome."
5,I just think Neil is cool.,"I watch this dude every time I get a chance. He's cool. His show is intelligent and balanced. It's relaxed but not lazy. He's firm but not overbearing.For some reason, one of my books is always listed on his amazon page and this one is listed on mine ""The Wisdom of Shepherds."" (I also wrote The Greatest White Trash Love Story Ever Told,where my email address is displayed). I am honored that my book is connected to Neil's. I would like nothing more than to be on his show-- heck I might even offer up my controversial social-policy opinions or something like that.Anyway, Neil is the man. Watch him. Buy this book. Seriously, buy this book."
4,Es ist nur ein Zeitgeist,"Bile is an industrial band with distorted vocals and guitars with a bunch of soundbytes which gives them a great raw sound. I really enjoy listening to this album, especially Suckpump. Another good thing about these cd's is that they come together for the price of one. The only drawback are the tracks of soundbytes and other noises, I just see these tracks as filler and Teknowhore has most of these filler tracks. My favorite tracks would have to be Head, I Reject and Get Out. So if you like distorted industrial music or want something different then these cd's are for you."
5,Woo Hoo...at last,"a must have for BILE fans, for those of you who dont have suckpump or teknowhore...well here ya go with extras!"
2,"5 Months Old, Strap Broke","Inexpensive replacement ... and cheap. Five months after replacing the years-old, original (long) strap the replacement cracked. Yes, they are inexpensive but the plastic is very cheap and quite stiff, especially when it becomes cold. The quality of the replacement straps is much lower than those attached to the new watch. Look elsewhere."
1,Nothing like the picture,"This item says it would fit a Casio watch, which it does not. Also the strap shown in the picture is nothing like the one received. They charged more for shipping then the item cost."
2,Did not fit,"I was not expecting anything fancy for the price, just a generic replacement for a g-shock watchband and this item showed up when I did a search. Unfortunately it is too wide and does not fit. Very disappointed. Guess I will have to buy the original band....a lot more expensive but guaranteed fit and quality."
3,Good watchband,"Good replacement watchband. I bought this because of the metal buckle; the one that came with the watch was plastic and broke easily, so this is a bit of an upgrade, great for only a few dollars!Some bad stuff to consider:The band itself feels a little less durable than i expected; I can anticipate it drying out and cracking.Te spring bars that came with it are a little small or not as springy as the ones that came with my watch. I have had one pop out twice in the week since i have had it. Not a big deal at all, but something to consider."
4,Not the best fit but work just fine,The fit on my Casio dual time watch had one of the bands break and after rigging it for a while it was time for and replacement but on the economy side of the wallet and for the price this was it. We'll see how long this will last.
3,Make sure it's the right size,"I'm using this strap on a Casio DBC30-1 Databank Digital Watch. The strap is exactly 19mm wide at the end which attaches to the watch. The watch itself is 22mm wide at the attachment point. The band is easy to attach, but because the pins are not fully covered and protected, it has a tendency to pop off several times a week. I'll be searching for a 22mm replacement watch band.I think if you have a watch where a 19mm band is a perfect fit, this is a decent band for the price."
2,Sumewhat inscrutable modus operandi,"I had borrowed a Pelonix heater which was extremely easy to operate,could be set at temperatures varying by one degree increments, would remain in this mode until turned off, and was somewhat cheaper than the Lasko machine you shipped me which has none of these features. Please let me know if you carry the Pelonix line. Robert Cryan"
5,Awesome!,"I've watched this video countless times and I am always in awe with the dangers faced, surfers skills and videography."
1,"Incompatible Technology--do not buy this "" DVD ""","It will not play on a standard DVD player of any type. It will only play on your PC and allow it internet access to check the "" license "". So unless you like watching movies on the computer ( as oppposed to on your tv ) do not get this disc. Most disappointing. Bad technology."
1,Do not buy this - does not play.,"I bought the two-disk version of the movie as a gift. Because of DRM stuff, the DVD does not play. You have to get a license from syncast.com in order to watch the movie, but syncast.com is no longer functioning."
5,Refreshing,"I don't own this DVD personally, but I have seen the whole documentary. I found it refreshing and motivating since I haven't picked up a board since I was in middle school. I particularly like the segment on surfing in Ireland and Northern Ireland and the surfing in Half Moon Bay. I totally recommend watching this on those rainy days when you have nothing better to do."
2,"Cool for the history, but the movie is dated","I liked the movie for some of the history and background on surfing, but the movie is geting a little old. And not ""classic"" old like the endless summer..."
5,A superb Bluray example,Are you a surfer? No? Ok well just admire the beauty then of high definition water and a rather compelling documentary that will have you wow'ed in no time at all.
4,"Amazing Footage, great interviews, but the soundtrack sucks","I love the footage! The photography is amazing, and the famous surfers in the documentary were very disarming and modest. There's a real sense of camaraderie, and no one seemed to have a big head.My only criticisms are that the music is awful, and it would've been cool to hear the waves crashing instead of the cheesy music in some parts. Overall, it's very enjoyable. Even my sister loved it (and she is not at all interested in surfing! Well, she wasn't before Step Into Liquid!)"
3,review,very good x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x xxxxxxxxxxxx cccccccccccccccccccccccccc xxxx xx
3,Didn't Live Up to Its Reviews,"I am always in search of the perfect surfing movie. The reviews I read suggested that this was it. Sadly, nothing made it stand out from the others that I have seen. The Endless Summer was the original and I will stick with it. If you want more story and less voiceover, try Big Wednesday."
3,WARNING,"The disk 2 - DVD ROM - will only work in USA and CANADA.As soon as you push to play the disk, it pause and go to the ARTISAN site to get a license to work. So if you are not in USA or CANADA they will not give you a license number and the disk will not run."
4,Four stars for video...1 star for content,"The film is great!!! ANY outdoor enthusiast should own this film...It is lovingly narrated, beautifully shot, and the waves will leave you breathless even if you have never surfed...Their featured surfers are amazing and totally insane!If you are looking at the video for it's HD content forget about it. The service on the back end (licensing stuff) failed every time I tried it. It uses some gimmicky through windows to make sure you have a legit copy of the DVD Data content (which I most certainly do). I attempted to watch this on several PCs, with different flavors of XP or Vista, and on a couple networks...Nothing!!! The second disc is a frisbee. If you want the HD content, it is not going to happen."
5,Step into liquid.... gladly,"Step into liquid is an amazing movie, that in my opinion... everyone should see. It is just a feel good movie about the joys of the surfing world. If you don't surf, no worries... you ought to still enjoy it.Living in Hawaii, the struggle for surf gets difficult with some of the more experienced riders... as it gets competetive. But this movie shows the exact opposite approach. It shows that no matter who you are (living on the Great lakes), you can have the time of your life just being out in the water, regardless if you catch a wave or not. Its all about soul energy and if you don't know what I mean.... go surf.Its a great movie... so check it out. As for the dude thats been surfing for every day of the past 25 years, you are my hero!!!! and keep on going till you physically can't. Enjoy"
1,"Alternative title: ""Step Into a Cesspool of Sentiment""","Seriously this is spilling over with random opinions and ramblings of personal experience. Its a hollywood take on surfing. If you want see a surf movie with soul go watch ""Singlefin: Yellow"" or ""Thicker Than Water"" or ""September Sessions""."
2,"""Hollywood"" Surf Documentary","The voice over sounds like the guy from the hoky motivational videos everyone had to watch in high school. This is an overly-sentimental piece of sh*t. Some, and only some, of the visuals are really incredible (the tow-in scenes)..the rest is a feel-good, surfers-are-awesome waste of time. I love to surf...for my own reasons. It's not because I need to feel like a part of a big ""community"". For authentic, thought-provoking surf films, check out ""thicker than water"", ""brokedown melody"" and ""september sessions"". Save ""step into liquid"" for the people who fall all over themselves for the next predictable hollywood offering."
1,dvd does not work,"I ordered this as a christmas present for my dad... the DVD will start to play, then stop suddenly. At first i thought it was my parent's DVD player, it is not. I took the DVD home to watch it on one of my (3) DVD players... same problem. It will start to play, then skip. We ended up turning it off after about 20 minutes."
5,Surf culture ABC's,"One of the best surf vidios ever produced,, allows the public to understand the surfing world"
3,More for the family than the surfer..,"I guess it depends on what you are looking for. If it's a beautiful surf movie with incredible action and sick big wave surfing, this is not it. If it's a movie to watch with the kiddies, then yeah. Too much time spent on heart warming tales than sick late drops into blue wonderful."
2,Nice documentary - But not killer surf,"Interesting overall on the many aspects and location of surfing: lake, waves from an ocean freighter, sand, to finally the killer locations like jaws and the 100 miles off of California.Also, the hydro surfing was good, but not that much information.Ocerall, there was a shallowness to the piece. I would have enjoyed a greater depth to the killer surf locations and technology."
1,Step into Liquid- product a disappointment,"Unfortunately, when we opened up the 2-disk set, we were disappointed to see both disks are disk 2 of 2, and that disk 1 was missing."
1,STEP INTO LIQUID,"I'M VERY VERY BORED WITH THIS WMV HD DVD BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE IN MY COMPUTER BECAUSE I LIVE IN EUROPE I'VE BUYED IT AT AMAZON AND THEY SEND ME A WMV HD DVD ONLY PLAYABLE IN USA AND CANADA.I'VE TRIED BUY ANOTHER STEP INTO LIQUID PLAYABLE IN EUROPE AND I COULD NOT GET.I'VE ALREADY BUYED ALL I'M SAYING ALL WMV HD AVAIABLE AT AMAZON AND AND I CAN SEE ALL OF THEM AT MY COMPUTER,ONLY and ONLY THIS STEP INTO LIQUID IS NOT PLAYABLE IN EUROPE WHAT IS VERY BORING.RUI MARTINS - RUMAVIDEO"
1,Boring,"First off, the full version of Kelly Slater pro surfer IS NOT INCLUDED, that was the reason I bought the DVD.This movie is for KOOKS and NON SURFERS, it is boring and lame. No real surfing, nothing intense, nothing special. Buy another DVD."
1,horrible,"This is one of the worst surf movies ever! I mean all of the footage comes from other surf movies that are much much better, and it does not go into enough depth about the strapped crew. It says that laird hamilton and dave kalama are the onlt two apart of the crew, but there are about 10 more surfers in the actual crew. I have to say that also the guy who made this film did not do it very well. I mean you would expect Bruce Browns's son to make a better surf movie than this. (Bruce Brown made one of the best surf films of all time ""The Endless Summer"" series. Sorry but the person who made this film should know more about surfing before they make a film on it."
5,Delightful Tale of Trips to Australia,"I purchased the CD Rom, and loved hearing about Bill Bryson's trips to Australia.BUT the CD Rom tracks skipped! I was always having to correct the track, to keep the story in the correct order."
5,It certainly is a VERY interesting country,"..and that's all Bill is saying, with his customary accessible erudition and likeable humour. As an ex-Pom, now besotted with this interesting country, I read it aloud to my (African) husband sitting on a patch of beautiful coastline in Sydney. We were vastly entertained and informed. We hugged ourselves with glee anew at having discovered some of what Bill discovered, and were inspired to discover the (much) more we have not. We put it on our present list for all our US and UK friends who still don't understand why we are here. We hope Bill comes back and writes some more, as he so clearly wanted to.Read this book and I defy anybody with more than a modicum of adventure in their soul not to want to explore this VERY interesting country."
3,This is not Australia&#65533;or it is?,"Throughout the book I kept saying to myself, `Bill you're a bloody brat'. Focusing on nasty animals that can kill, going to places that I wouldn't send my worst relatives to, and a lack of preparation, continually frustrated me throughout this book.But then I realised that this was deliberate. Bill was not looking to create a travel brochure on Australia; he was creating a tale about Australia - warts and all.He discovers that how vast the country is in size and also gets an insight into its relationship with aborigines. My favourite part was his description of listening to the cricket on the radio, while driving to Adelaide.This book will be lost on all but those with some experience of Australia - either having visited the country or knowing an Australia. Don't buy this in place of a Lonely Planet or Let's Go guide."
5,A hilarious account of travel down under,"Bill Bryson's ""Sunburned Country"" is an incredibly funny and informative account of Australia. ""The Great Barrier Reef contains at least 1500 species of fish, 400 types of coral and 4000 varieties of molluscs, but those are essentially just guesses"" says Mr Bryson. He then goes on to say that no one has ever attempted a comprehensive survey because the Great Barrier Reef is just ""too big a job"".Like all his other accounts of travel around the world, the narrator's sarcasm is very evident and this leaves the reader in stitches. ""Sunburned Country""is an extremely enjoyable and fascinating read. I also recommend Mr Bryson's other books such as ""Notes from a Small Island"" and ""The Lost Continent""."
4,Australia Discovered At Last!,"Bill Bryson travels Australia - by train, plane and car, investigates cities and the lonely vast outback, goes boogie boarding in the surf (always mindful of sharks, rips, seasnakes and jellyfish) and generally has a great time. Bill has done his homework - I can vouch for many of his tales - a good read."
4,All around a great book.,"I was assigned to read this book for a class that I took on my study abroad trip to Australia. The author is HILARIOUS in his writing style and I have learned a lot of interesting facts about Australia, the people, the aboriginal history and the unique and special animals in its landscape. There were some dry spots that I had to grudge through and honestly wished he would get to the freaking point, but all in all it was a great read. I was in a group of 23 other students and they all seemed to enjoy the book as well."
5,The Bryson tradition continues...,"As with other Bryson books, this one made me chuckle and howl (sometimes in public, much to my embarassment). You can't help but laugh out loud! Bryson travels all around the continent and packs this volume with hilarious stories and manages to slip a number of interesting facts in along the way. Some of the highlights of the book include a in-depth discussion of the alarming number of things that can kill you Down Under (watch out for the jelly fish!) as well as the story of the time when the author was chased thru a garden by two very large dogs. (I should also point out that the story about the author's first visit to Austr. when he fell asleep in his tour guide's car had me laughing so hard tears were rolling down my face.) All in all, I found it to be a fun, very light read. If you liked this one, you should also check out ""Notes from a Small Island"" and ""I'm a Stranger Here Myself."""
3,It's a really great country. <yawn>,"Bryson mixes a history lesson with his personal experience to bring his Australia to the reader. He gets to write the whole thing off as a business expense, I imagine. Nice for him!He covers a lot of ground, slaps a lot of bugs, quaffs cold beer every night, and expresses a sincere appreciation for the miseries of travel in ""A Sunburned Country.""I laughed out loud on many occasions, expressed an occasional 'wow really?' and overall, enjoyed the book.If I had not participated in a very boring online chat with Bryson on CNN I would not have been familiar with the book at all.I probably would not have missed very much."
2,Unimpressed,"Picked up this book after having heard it was funny, informative, and easy to read. Within the first few pages i became disillusioned! It's hard not to be really, when Mr Bryson refers to spiders as insects, and in his initial segment to point out ""some facts"", states that Australia is a single island continent. I'd be curious as to which continent New Zealand belongs to then? Maybe Australasia ceased to be in the day he lost crossing the date line? Having spent over a quater of a year in Oz some of his comments managed to make me chuckle, especially regarding Red Back Spiders, but on the whole i was disappointed. At the price, i'm not inspired to buy another of his titles."
2,Where's the dignity?,"As for a book on Austrailia, it was good and information. The jokes were aimed for older readers and often perverted. These lame jokes could have easily been left out or replaced with better ones."
1,Audio CD review: His prose is annoying when spoken aloud,"You get your money's worth here--there are a ton of CDs in this audio book. Unfortunately, I found Bryson's prose (which I enjoyed a lot when reading silently, as I have done with his other books) to be greatly irritating when spoken aloud. To me, he sounds kind of 'affected' in parts, and sometimes there is a sort of ""moist"" sound when he pronounces words. Hard to describe until you hear the CD, but trust me on this one. I think a lot of the positive reviews on here are for the book, and not the CD. I would stick with the written word on this one."
2,Wasted time,"We are visiting Australia soon and a friend, who, like us, had enjoyed his A Walk in the Woods and Everything You Wanted to Know ..., recommended this book about Australia. It was not really worth the price. Noted only a few things in the book which prompted me to want to visit or look further into them, like the abuse of the Aboriginals. Otherwise, prettty much a waste of time. My wife decided to give up on the book and didn't even finish it."
1,I'm offended he didn't bother talking to the Aboriginies,Lazy lazy! How can Bryson dare having an opinion on Aboriginies when he doesn't take the time to talk to one of them. He doesn't bother visiting Tasmania or Brisbane therefore his journey cannot be complete... Oppose to his previous literary works I find this one a lazy boring unispiring read. His sense of humour is gone as well. I wish he didn't hurry so much to meet his publishing deadline.
1,cheated,This book has the exactly same content (word by word) with another Bill Bryson's book under the title 'Down Under'I searched both books thoroughly and neither of them said anything about another book with the exactly content as itself.I bought both and felt CHEATED.
4,Poor Cartography,"As a lover of travel and travel books and a fan of Bill Bryson's writing style, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, except for one irritating omission. Like most Americans, I am not that familiar with the geography of Australia and kept wondering exactly where Adelaide or Perth are located in relation to other Australian cities. The small sectional maps presented at the front of the book are poorly drawn and inadequate for one who wants to see an overall view of Australia and how the locations Bryson writes about relate geographically to each other. Even though one of the four small maps endeavors to show the entire country, it seems to be skewed and out of scale. In Paul Theroux's similar travelogue THE KINGDOM BY THE SEA, the publishers thoughtfully included an overall map of Great Britain to scale so the reader could follow Theroux's travels in toto. This book would have been greatly enhanced by a similar treatment of the Australian continent."
5,even aussies love it!,"We Australians are a pretty insecure lot, we are always very wary of how our country is being portrayed overseas. I personally got up late at night during the Olympics to see what the 'NBC Today Show' coverage from Sydney was like. Naturally when I heard that Bill Bryson's 'Sunburned Country' was doing well overseas I had to see what it had to say.I must say I thoroughly enjoyed the read and oftentimes was bursting with pride (as well as laughter) at what Bryson wrote. Very rarely does anyone really get inside this country and tell people what it is all about - Bryson does it in this book. We get sick of the constant Aussie steriotypes being sent overseas - Kangaroos and Crockodile Dundee. Bryson goes beyond this and really digs deep into the country, its people, its history, and its culture."
3,Engaging in Parts,"I have thoroughly enjoyed Bryson's other books, and found myself laughing every few pages in this one, but maybe I'm getting accustomed to his style, as I didn't find this as satisfying, page for page, as his other efforts. I think perhaps his lack of familiarity with the country left him reporting his findings more than commenting on them, and it's his commentary that is so engaging. the book had more history and descriptions, and I wanted the wise cracks!"
5,I'm There Now and He Couldn't Have Been More Right,"I've just moved to Canberra, Australia from Texas and have fallen in love with this book! While Mr Bryson was a bit hard on this beautiful city (OK, he eased up at the end of the chapter), generally speaking his observations of the people, the land and the culture could not be more right on. I laughed out loud many times when I first read this book. I still go back as a reference when I visit some of the same places that he wrote about.... and I laugh again. He really captures the essence of this place so well with a sense of wit and insight that you will not find in any other travel book. For anyone contemplating a visit down under this book is a must read. That said, I recommend it to anyone who loves a well written, amusing book which goes a step beyond in insight and in historical context. Highly recommended!!"
5,The unexplored continent..,"Nothing makes me want to travel more than a book by Bill Bryson. His adventures in Australia make me want to see/find the unknown plants, to look for gold in the desert, to see the ancient microbiology of the west coast(of course, at all times keepng an eye out for deadly things that could kill me instantaneously). Maybe I will hitch a ride to Australia and see the Great Barrier Reef(watching out for sharks the whole time of course)"
5,Yet Another Positive Review,"I'd rate this somewhere between a 4 and 5. I read this book before a recent trip to Australia and found Mr. Bryson's comments about both the country and the people to be right on the mark. Additionally he has a great sense of humor. I saw Australians reading the book, perhaps the ultimate endorsement. Althought I only went to major cities, Mr. Bryson made me want to go deep into the continent. A great read."
2,Funny but sloppy with the facts,"Bryson is as funny and as lively as ever. Laugh-out-loud funny. But this is one of the few books I've ever quit before finishing. Bryson makes too many factual mistakes and mis-shadings of his subjects. He clearly tried to assimilate too much material too fast as a writer when he was travelling; the result is bad history and bad journalism, though good comedy. Nothing I spotted was consequential by itself, but by the third little error in 30 pages -- and who knows what else I didn't spot - I figured I might end up mistaken about Australia when I get there myself if I kept reading. Read this book if you want to smile, not if you want to learn and get things right. Think of reading this book like watching a sitcom about Australia; you'll laugh and pick up a few things, but never forget it's just entertainment."
2,Expected much better.,"Disappointing.The book seemed rushed, and Bryson too easily reverts to stereotypical Australian characteristics as his subject matter.He provides very few intuitive insights into the foibles and quirks of the locals, as canbe found in so many of the other books that he's produced. That could possibly be put down to the fact that he has not lived in Australia, and as he appears to have been in some haste to get through his travels in this country, it's perhaps not surprising that he would come out of it with nothing more than a superficial view."
2,A bookshop tour,"Billy Bryson is a talented writer. He just needs to get out of his car more.I just finished this book, and although the writer's patter could make acupuncture interesting, the lack of effort in this one is staggering.Billy prefers to write about huge walks in safe city suburbs, visiting bookshops and coffee shops, oh and museums.Maybe all those things are impossible in the US..Maybe it is all those dangerous critters that kept him on the narrow path..I really don't think he needs to travel to write at this level. It seems he could do this without treading outside of his study.Most of this book is paraphrased from other books ( a large bibliography is tell tale), and the personal content is stuff not worthy of print.In A Sunburnt Country he barely steps out of his car, except for when he doesn't have a car and is walking the streets.I do not recommend this to anyone. It is a lazy effort."
2,did the sun get to his head?,"I can only suggest that if you've heard that Bryson is funny, you really want to check out his earlier books ""The Lost Continent"" (about a trip through the US) and ""Neither Here nor There"" (about a trip through Europe). His keep-it-moving gather-no-moss travel style is ill-suited to Australia, which is simply so sparsely populated over so much of the continent as to be absurd -- and yet he never comments on the absurdity of his choice. This book is, by comparison to his earlier efforts, a big old snoozer -- skip this one in favor of those."
1,Doesn't quite get it,"Bills writing isn't in dispute. But he does miss the magic of Australians. In reading this I was both offended and bewildered, wondering what country is he in? Sadly this is such a two-dimensional view on Australia that it grieves me to read it as an Australian. I'm saddened this is what an outsider thinks of my country."
5,Bryson at his best,"I read this novel shortly before I embarked on a, as yet unfinished, quest in Sydney 5 years ago. Since then a scarcely a month with go by without me thinking about this book. This is classic Bryson comedy in a lucky country.Australians love this book because it shows them reasons to be patriotic that go beyond the sport and the weather/beaches. Bryson's enlightened and quirky view of the world provides ample reason for Australians to be proud.Travellers/Foreigners will love this book because it is simple and written from a perspective that most westerners have faced at some time or another. You are in a foreign country, but it feels like home. All the signs are different and the culture is strange, accent is odd, yet you could easily be in a different town near where you grew up.Bryson's unfailing ability to humourously state the obvious is, as always, outstanding in this book. Well worth a read."
5,Funny and Informative,"I didn't know much about Bill Bryson except that he had written A Short History of Nearly Everything (which had nearly bored me to tears, the first time I tried to read it), but I gave this book a chance and I am so glad I did.I think Bill Bryson is just about the funniest man alive. I was laughing so hard I was in tears more than a few times. I also really enjoy the history he gave about Australia.Bill Bryson is one of my very favorite authors because of this book."
3,down under,"It is true that Bill Bryson is perhaps the type who would not always let the truth get in the way of a good story, and that not all of the facts in the book are entirely accurate, but overall you could not possibly say that this book is phenomenally bad. There are at least two segments that were hilarious, and Bryson keeps things entertaining. At its best the book could even be called brilliant-there's just something about the story of the two old people who emerge from the fog arguing only to wander off again. 3 stars."
3,Like listening to grandpa,"Much like listening to grandpa's long drawn out stories. you know they can be funny and that there is a point to them...you just wish he'd get to the point! Bryson is able to find the humor in the most unlikely places, this time in Australia's vast expanses. But he tends to ramble and drag on and become tedious."
3,Very good but very incomplete,"A Bryson classic, full of information and a treasure trove of interesting stuff to learn. once again, my hat goes off to his investigative acumen. but, and that's a big BUT, he finished the book without interviewing a single Aborigine. OK, he mentioned their plight, their second-class, ""invisible"" status in the Australian society, but why he wouldn't talk or even try to talk with at least one of them is beyond me. he could have spent much less time in those long, lonely, endless drives in the middle of nowhere and bring some perspective into the whole thing. and to finish it off, i don't know how he signed off without giving a few pages to boomerangs and kangoroos."
3,Less than expected,"Bryson's later books (At Home and A Short History of Nearly Everything)led me to read Sunburned Country but I found it lacked the cohesiveness of his later works. The facts presented, as ever, are fascinating. It is certainly worth a read for learning offbeat aspects about Australia."
4,"Safe to Read in Public, but Good Anyway","While not as funny as his previous books, it is so well-written that it is still a joy to read. Missing, however, is the danger of strangers thinking you to be insane as you read the book in public laughing hysterically to yourself. Too bad. Not quite 5 stars, but I'd give it 4 1/2 if I could."
4,Almost vintage Bryson,"You win some, you lose some. This latest offering by Mr. Bryson is closer to being a winner than some of his other books (especially ""Made in America"" and ""A Walk in the Woods""). It's not up to ""The Lost Continent"" standards, but not far off.There are a few laughs to be had as our familiar traveler makes his way across Australia, visiting a huge number of places. Mr. Bryson writes well and his descriptions and conversations are interesting, insightful and humerous. Fortunatly, he is less smug than he has been been in some previous books as well.If you're looking for a guid to Australia, then this probably isn't the travel book for you. If you're looking for a well written, humerous look at another world, then this book is a must read.Of course, I have all the others, so I was bound to buy this one anyway..."
3,Not Bryson's Best Work,"I purchased Sunburned after reading a couple of others by Bryson. While Sunburned is a relaxing read, I was ultimately disappointed. One glaring omission is the lack of witty character development so prominent in other Bryson books. Further, Sunburned is long - 300 pages of what seemed like 8 point type - and painfully slow at times. All in all, it seemed like Bryson was uncharacteristically straining to come up with things to write about.If you are new to Bill Bryson, I suggest going with A Walk in the Woods instead."
4,Fun way to know more about Australia.,Its a great book. It covers most of Australian cities. A must read if planning on travelling to Australia.
5,it's a travel book...and it's funny!,"I never thought a travel book could be laugh-out-loud funny, but this one definitely is. Bill Bryson travels to Australia, not only to the cities and tourist areas, but also off the beaten path to more unconventional spots. Packed with informative historical information and tidbits (most of which are likely to shock you) about the oft-misunderstood nation, Bryson mixes in his hysterically funny adventures, told with his unique spin on things. After reading this book, I not only want to visit Australia, but I am also determined to read more books by Bill Bryson."
4,interesting read,"I read ""Walk in the Woods"" years ago and think of it quite often. This one is just as good."
2,disappointed,"After much anticipation, I was disappointed at the flippant tone of this book. As an expat Australian living in the US I devour any books about Australia. There are several inaccuracies - sentences that appeared to be tossed off for effect rather than content. I agree with the previous reviewer - a quick best seller for the author, without much input."
3,"Good, but not that good.","I didn't enjoy this Bill Bryson book as much as I had expected to. The book is a fast read and has a number of laughs, but it represents a departure from some of his earlier books.This book contains a LOT research on Australian history, politics, and botany. True, it's presented in as humorous a way as it might be able to be presented, but I wasn't that interested in the subject matter. It seems that Mr. Bryson could have written the book without actually ever having set foot in Australia as his encounters with Australians are relatively few and far between in this book. True, part of that is due to the distances he must have drove -- you don't meet too many people in your car. But, at times I felt like I was his captive passenger as he told yey another anecdote about Australian explorers or deadly fauna.The most engaging part of Bryson's writings that I enjoy is truly getting a flavor of the place he's visiting -- in this case, I think he missed the mark."
4,Humorous look at Land Down Under,This is a humorous travelog about Australia. Bryson provides many interesting stories about various parts of the land. It is only missing an overall theme or arc to bring the whole book together. Worth reading if you have any interest in Australia.
4,Watch out for that...!,"Wonderful book. For those of us who tend to be armchair travellers, Mr. Bryson does all of the research AND all of the difficult travel! And he's funny, besides. What could be better?As I read this, I could picture myself on the cross-country train, getting stranded in the desert, seeing the Big Lobster, and getting stung by something I'd regret. That, to me, is the mark of a good travelogue -- you are there.Some say they found ""A Walk in the Woods"" preachy, and that this book is refreshing in that it's not preachy. I'll take issue with the term elsewhere; the difference here is (as Mr. B points out) that there's no need to warn the Australians of what they could be losing -- they do a very nice job of conservation themselves, thank you. Unlike us. But that's another story.Read this book. If you want a good laugh, if you want to go to Australia, if you don't want to go to Australia. It's very definitely worth the read."
3,A bit of a disappointment,"Not that it is a bad travel book, as travel books go, but not a worthy Bryson. I have read all his books and usually keep them for when I am alone, or at least at home. That is because laughing out loud so often in public can get you stared at. This book, unfortunately, can be read anywhere. It is informative but doesn't have that humor I have grown to expect and wait for in Bryson's fabulous books."
3,Heat and Dust,"Not up there with 'The Lost Continent' (a little masterpiece), but an enjoyable read nontheless.Some grating factual errors, and the odd oversight (apart from omission of Tasmania). When he stopped overnight at Hay, he didn't notice Hell, just up the road. Or nearby Booligal. Thus, the saying '... Hay, Hell and Booligal', most evocative of heat, dust and limitless horizon. He aslo missed everybody's favourite place name, Upotipotpon.He might also have sourced his title, which is celebrated in:'I love a sunburnt country/ A land of sweeping plains/ Of rugged mountain ranges/ Of droughts and flooding rainsI love her far horizons/ I love her jewelled sea/ Her beauties and her terrors/ The wide brown land for me.'For all that, well done Bill, and come back again."
3,Brysons rambles ....,"His other books I have really enjoyed - this I found dry and droll.Brysons books would not make me want to visit any of the places he describes. I find that they are helpfull when they are about places you already familiar with. They tend to make you look twice at the impressions you have already made.For me being English and moving to California - ""Notes from a Small Island"" and ""Notes from a Big Country"" hit the spot."
3,"Fun, but a bit long winded","I bought the book with the idea of reading it BEFORE our recent trip to Australia this past Christmas. That didn't happen. Then I nominated it for our book club to read -that didn't happen! Finally our book club choose it for a back up and I had to read it. I enjoyed it more after having been to Australia. Mr. Bryson's humor is terrific and the places he visited really gave you a true bird's eye view of being or visiting Australia. The book was wordy and he could have gotten to the point quicker to keep the reader more substained to hold the interest longer. I lost interest and find myself putting it down, and then picking it back up. On the positive side of that, you didn't have to worry about plot, etc. so if you missed something it was no big deal!"
4,"liked ""Walk in the Woods"" better","Perhaps because I once hiked part of the Appalachain Trail, I liked ""A Walk in the Woods"" better than this book. I mean, I like Austrailia, but I never warmed to the story as much. I'd like to read other books by the author before maiing my final decision, though. I just never got as emotionally involved this time."
5,Excellent,"This book is thoroughly enjoyable! It is very different from the ""normal"" tourist books and provides the reader with a humorous inside look at travels in Australia. It is blunt, honest and straightforward. I laughed out loud at the author's comic observations around him. I learned alot of interesting ""historical tidbits"" in a very painfree fashion. I would highly recommend this book if you are planning to travel to Australia. If you are not planning on going to Australia, you will want to go after you finish this book."
4,Entertaining!,"Bill Bryson delivers again - well-written, educational, and laugh-out-loud funny. I've never been to Australia and I am not all that familiar with the geography of the cities and sites in relation to each other. I first listened to the audiobook. I love that Bryson personally read the book but I was getting confused about the geography so I decided to pick up the actual book. To me, the book was better because I could keep referring back to the map to get some perspective. If you're a Bryson fan, this book will not disappoint."
2,Funny but not the best Bryson book,"4892. In a Sunburned Country, by Bill Bryson (read 2 Jan 2012) This is a 2000 book detailing Bryson's quite extensive travels in Australia. It is often funny, especially in the early chapters. There is a map which shows nearly every place mentioned in the book, I was glad to see. He got to every part of Australia except Tasmania. Often the travel seemed really tiresome and there are a lot of uncomfortable places that he went to. But one gets a pretty good picture of what travel in Australia would be like--not that I would want to do such travel. Not a profound book, and a good history would probably be better reading. It is the fourth Bryson book I have read. Of the four, I thought The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid was the best."
5,Another gem from Bill Bryson,"Yes, Bill, you have done it again. I live in New Caledonia and have been to NSW a few times and know I'll never get further into Australia, due to lack of time. This book transported me to those places I shall not visit and it will transport anyone else too, even if you live on the other side of the planet. Funny, of course, as always, but packed with historical facts and anecdotes, Bill Bryson has also done his homework. Fascinating and sensitive, the characters he meets (I assume they were or are real) are described so beautifully that I feel I can reach out and shake their hands. A book for everyone, even if you think you have no interest in this particular continent, you'll be hooked after page 2."
5,In a Sunburned Country,Bryson is a hoot! Read this in Australia while I was experiencing what he was writing about. Now I want to go back based on Bryson's descriptions.
4,Off I Go...,"I really don't need a book to convince to travel somewhere, but after deciding that I wanted to go to Australia next I grabbed this book and the Lonely Planet guide to mix it up. On my last trip out of the country I met a single-serving friend on the flight back that highly recommended I read any of Bill Bryson's books; so a year later I took her up on the recommendation and purchased this after reading reviews on books about Australia.I like comedy with my travel writing and this guy is kind of like a self-effacing comedian. He explains his travels in detail, warning you where not to go, what not to touch, the history of an area and a culture, and all with a humorous touch.I would recommend it to anyone who wants to travel to Oz, expand their knowledge of the place, or just read a funny, well-written narrative."
5,Excellent last second choice!,"I grabbed this book just before boarding the plane at LAX to Melbourne, Australia with myAussie husband. An avid reader, I had already read the book I planned to read on the trip during the layover and as I am a terrible sleeper when on a plane I was desperate to get another book to read for the loooong flight to the Land Down Under. I made an excellent last second choice and laughed myself silly under the night light! I have never had such an enjoyable trip over and looked at things in Oz in a new light. Bill Bryson is a funny,knowledgeable, interesting, irreverent writer and I am glad I was fortunate enough to pick THIS BOOK in my haste!"
4,World's Greatest Unknown Treasure,"I'm a 54 year old Aussie & I learnt things about my homeland that I never knew (but should). This book has a laugh on every page, couldn't put it down. But a warning my dear American cousins, Bill Bryson does exaggerate the dangers of Australian wildlife. Do you see grizzly bears in Central Park? Methinks he doth protest too much! Apart from that little issue, this book does reflect the world's greatest unknown treasure. Come on down & stay a while, this book is just but a taste."
3,Mildly Entertaining and Informative,"This is the first time that I've read one of Bryson's books, so I didn't know what to expect. The book has a wealth of information about the history and current culture of Australia, which I enjoyed very much. There are also many uninteresting stories about ridiculously trivial aspects of Aussie life. This book is great for those, like myself, who will be visiting and want to learn more about Australia. For pure entertainment though, I'd look for other options."
4,The Road to Recovery,"After the nadir of ""A Walk in the Woods"" this book continues Bill Bryson's recovery that started with ""I'm a Stranger Here Myself"". While not matching ""The Lost Continent"" or ""Notes from a Small Island"" on occasions it comes close.Bryson retains his obvious affection for the people and places he writes about, and there are a few of the laugh out loud moments that made ""Notes From a Small Island"" such a hazardous read in public places. Otherwise it's fairly droll, and as so often with such books, tells us as much about the author as the ostensible subject of his books. Trouble is, by now regulars know the author pretty well and that particular subject is beginning to pall.Such quibbles aside, this book is still better than the vast majority of similar writings, and can be recommended.Just one question though. Why didn't he title it by the accurate quote which he himself notes should be ""In a Sunburnt Country""? Too archaic for our American cousins?"
4,Another Bill Bryson classic,"Not as funny as A WALK THROUGH THE WOODS, but very entertaining. I really like how he combines his personal journey with history of Australia. He tries to get inside the culture, but freely admits to being an outsider. I would especially recommend this book if you are planning on going to Australia in the near future. It will help you to connect with the country in a big way."
5,Brilliant....,"I approached this book with a fair bit of skepticism because, lets face it, how interesting can a 350 page book about a scarcely known land be? To be perfectly fair though, I must say that I was surprisingly bowled over. Bill Bryson is a brilliant author who was able to inject much life and wit into, what could have quite easily been a phenomenally boring and dry piece. In addition, I would highly suggest the CD versions of Bryson's books to absorb the full effect of his comedic prowess. In short, I couldn't have been happier with this book and that's all I've got to say about that. Read the book and you'll soon understand that last sentence!"
4,Bryson can make plain dirt intersting,"Bryson can write about absolutely anything - watching grass grow, watching fish not bite, watching dirt just lie there by the side of the road - and make it interesting. In a Sunburned Country is not his best, best book, but it's right up there.Bryson is in his favorite element when confronted with oddities of whatever area of the planet he's exploring. If there's one place on this planet that's filled with enough oddities to keep a curious man on the tips of his toes, it's Australia. The place abounds with critters that exist nowhere else on earth, including its people. As usual, for at least part of the way he is accompanied by a memorable companion, which gives him an opportunity to talk to his reading audience via dialogue with the guy sharing his motel room or sitting next to him in a car traveling thousands of miles through sere terrain.This is travel writing at its best, with a HUGE dose of humor."
5,Bill Bryson - In a Sunburned Country,"""Sunburned Country"" is one fantastic audio book. I had no idea what I was in for, knowing very little about Australia, but Mr. Bryson's descriptions of his excellent adventures back and forth across the continent/country down under were VERY enlightening. I've grown to be very fond of his audio books, which he narrates himself. His distintive style and unique Iowegian/British accent add much color and interest to his recitations. His observances and opinions make for a super listen. I now want to visit Aussie-Land for myself!"
4,"mate, this book is bloody good!","since i moved back to europe, after living 18 years down under, all sorts of people ask me to explain the land down under, its quirks etc, at times i realise (only to late) that i have done something you only do in australia (like having a sligh panicky look at the sight of any spider) only to have afterwads a bunch of people staring at you with that ""she is nuts"" sort of look...after reading this book (a farewell gift that has been sitting in the shelf waiting its turn to be read) i now dont answer ""silly"" questions about oz, i simply write down the name and author of the book and let them find out..."
4,Great job,"The audio book sat on my shelf for quite some time before I got round to listening to it. Being an Aussie away from home, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It made me homesick, wanting to go back and visit the places Bill had seen but I had not. I wish he would go back and write another."
3,Experience Down Under,"I read this book after we lived in Australia for almost a year and were about to go on a road trip. I was looking for a book that would give me an overview of Australia before going on the road. A book with ideas about what to do and what to see. After readingA Short History of Nearly Everything: Special Illustrated Editionyears ago I knew that Bryson loves going into details. So my hopes were high.This book turned out to be a small disappointment to me. ""Down under"" isn't a book about Australia as a whole. Bryson focuses on details, on the people he has met while visiting Australia on short visits (2-3 weeks at a time). He writes about walking through North Sydney, about his trip to Alice Springs, about strange Australian animals like platypus and echidna.It turned out to be a nice book to read, but not what I was looking for. Still I would recommend this book because it gives some unexpected details about Australia."
5,Road Trip,"I initially bought the CD version of Sunburned Country thinking it would keep me from driving off I-5 into a feedlot while traversing San Francisco to LA and back. As it turned out - Mr. Bryson's account is so much more than caffeine or background entertainment that I must revisit this book (without the roar of Big Rigs or BMW's) to experience the details, wonderful insight, amazing adventures and most of all - hilarious perspective that he brings to Australia. Hearing it read by the author adds the perfect pitch to this journey, which has made this ""book"" a treasure!!"
4,Bill Bryson Down Under...At Last!,"Not as uproariously funny as A Walk In the Woods, and surprizingly more gentle than his previous looks at his home country, the United States. Whether he has mellowed with age or just genuinely likes Australians, he shows much more inclination to ""suffer fools lightly"" in this book, and even to enjoy their company.Most of all I thought Bryson did an excellent job of involving the reader in the delight of discovering this vast, unique and mostly unknown continent/country/island. I really felt that I was experiencing the trip with him. As one who has always wanted to see Australia, I felt I had finally been there, but it only wetted my appetite to ""see"" more."
5,Charming,"Bryson's witty, self-effacing humor and wry observations make this a fun read. Australia is an interesting continent and Bryson really brings it to life and our attention. I listened to the unabridged audio version of the book, read by Bryson himself (which was a treat)."
3,A wonderful travel book! I'm packing my bags!,"The only reason I first picked up this book is because I heard so much buzz about it. I found Australia to be a mildly interesting country and a place I'd love to visit, but would I really want to listen to someone describe their travels there? YES. Bill Bryson made me crack up laughing as he worked he away across the continent known as Australia. From Uluru to Sydney and all the way to lonely Perth, I found myself utterly wrapped up in Bryson's tales of his travels, which included sprinklings of history, plant and animal life, and racism. Except for a dry area in the middle, I found the book to be rather fast moving. If you want to read a wonderfully concise, witty writer, and get a real feel to Australia, pick up this book!"
3,Not so good !,A very casual treatment of an interesting continent ! Not much of new information. a light read.
2,Bryson is off the mark,"Bryson's book is an account of his trip to Australia, an account which has been embellished by exageration, extrapolation, inventions and parodies. An example is an event which Bryson suggests was an A-bomb detonation, but was in fact the impact of a piece of man-made space junk. The reentry of this junk was monitored before impact; and the impact site was surveyed and photographed; and so the event is not the mystery Bryson claims. A second example is Bryson's parodying of poetry by one of Australia's revered bush and war poets: Andrew Barton Paterson, CBE, but Bryson omitted any inclusion of Paterson or his work in the book's list of references. This book is funny in places, but the inaccuracies and the infantile quality of the writing (and repeated focus on excretia jokes)will ensure that it will be soon forgotten."
3,Juvenile - Great for Kids,"Has significant information, but overall, is very child based. As a childen's book, I would give it five stars. If you're looking for any significant information on the game, don't buy this book. If you're looking for something entertaining for your children, I would highly recommend. Personally, I was looking for information for a college thesis, and this book did not really help. If you don't want to buy it new, wait a few days, until mine is offered as used. The people need to know."
3,Great Book,This is the fourth book in Tamora Pierce's The Circle Opens quarter. It's a fantastic book; I highly recommend it.
5,Pretty Good,"I really love this seires! I recomend them to anyone into the whole people with magic thing. If you are going to read them, be sure to read the ones before it first."
5,Shatterglass,"This book is awesome! While the other books in ""The Circle Opens"" are okay, this is the one that I could not put down. Tamora Pierce is an STUPENDOUS writer and this is a STUPENDOUS book. Tris is likeable, funny and someone you can connect to and agree with. This is definetly my FAVORITE of all of Tamora Pierce's books!"
3,OMGOMG YAYAYAYAYAYAYAY,"Oh my gosh! In my opion this is her best book yet. I love the way she uses crafts, magic, and justice all tied in. Like magistrate magic, thread, wether, and crimes. I mean, you can get in trouble in religious families for reading too much about magic, but this isn't witches or anything evil. ""magic itself isn't evil, but it can be used for evil"" Everyone would benifit from reading her books, but I advise you to start at the beginning of the Circle of Magic. Then if you like the first one you can skip around. I am dead serious. ""I don't joke. It makes my head hurt"""
1,plagerism!,"Now, I am a huge fan of Tamora Pierce. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE her books. You're wondering about the low rating and confilicting title? Tamora Pierce STOLE this plot, (not word for word, but close.) From ""Demon in the Teahouse"", by Doorthy and Thomas Hoobler, which was published about four years before Shatterglass. Read that book, and compare it to ""Shatterglass."" Find that they have the same ending, almost same characters, and same ""clean"" principle? So did I. I am wondering why somone didn't catch this earlier, but in case you don't know, plagerism is ILLIGAL. My respect for Tamora Pierce has been shattered. (No pun intended.) I am waiting for the authorities to confront her about it, and am wondering how she thought she would get away with it."
2,A teen's view,"This book was in NO WAY as good as any other of Tamora Pierce's books. I enjoy her books very much, so I was SHOCKED when I read Shatterglass. The story is rather boring, with only a few good parts. A man (ghost) that is killing yaskedasu AKA Prostitutes, and a man who whines, and a weather mage have to stop him.The plot is that Tris, the weather mage going into a store, seing a man make a living glass dragon, and then because the man tries to kill it, Tris takes it home. This man, Keth had lightning strike him, so his glass magic is deformed. He is able to make glass balls that show a murderer. If Keth and Tris, can figure out how it works, they can stop the murderer.In all, I must say that it was confusing, strange and above all BORING. She has written many better book. A dissapointment."
4,Tris--that's enough,"Tris is my favorite character so my opinion is totally bias. The style of writing is pleasant and good. There is suspense but at other times it drags. The author tries mystery is the theme of her book and I admire her courage because, frankly, I didn't like it. I wanted to see more of my favorite character. And when thoughts came onto the page I read with rapture.Good job Mrs. Pierce!"
5,Really beautiful instrumental music!,This is really a nice CD! I have the CD player on repeat mode and it has been playing for hours. So relaxing and non intrusive instrumental music. The entire playlist has a sacred element to it.5 stars from me!
3,Erotic Thriller that's Campy Fun,"One of the better films of its genre, ""Lonely Hearts"" follows sad-sack Alma (Beverly D'Angelo) as she falls for con-man Frank (Eric Roberts) and proceeds to become his partner in crime. As the victims add up, Alma becomes more paranoid and Frank more desperate. Much of this film is unintentionally funny - just wait until you see Roberts parading around in a skimpy Speedo that he has no business wearing or watch Sharon Farrell's bad acting as poor duped Louise. Longtime fans of ""The Young snd the Restless"" will recognize Rebecca Street who sports the same pathetic personna she had on the Soap. You will also cheer when she buys it late in the film. As for the leads, Roberts makes a good bad boy but is outshone by D'Angelo, a great actress who never gets her due."
4,Lonely Hearts,This was a good movie. Thanks for sending it quickly and at a great price. Now I will be sharing it with other friends who like to see movies.
3,Interesting Document,"This is a good and interesting document. Tells a lot of raw truths about religion and it's profiteers. However, it claifies the differences between the reality of God and the concept of religion which has traditionally used to liberate a few and enslave the masses. Unfortunately, dated elements as rabid anti-Catholicism and pro-Bolshevism mar this message for modern readers, but if you can read this book with an open mind, it's quite revealing."
5,Great product!,I always look for AVS in channel vent visors when I get a new vehicle. Great product by a great company.
4,8/10 almost perfect,"Easy Install, works as intended. Sometimes the auto up window button makes the windows revert to halfway-up mode but no big deal."
1,no romance,"This book is so completely stupid and unromantic. The author did not even seem to try. In the first 8 pages, the author states that the hero and heroine met, fell in love, and became lovers so you don't even get to read about them falling in love. The author simply states ""they met here, fell in love, became lovers"" essentially. How is this romance? The author telling me the hero and heroine fall in love is not romance. The rest of the book consists of the hero and heroine playing mind games with each other and the heroine getting drugged and raped repeatedly by her teacher. Not my idea of romance."
1,I'm Sorry I ever knew this book was wrote!,After reading less than 30 pages I could not MAKE myself read anymore of this book. The author made me so mad I couldn't sleep. I spent more than a year in anticipation of getting this book and it was blown in less than an hour. I could not have been madder if I had been told that their would not be a sequel to Dreams of Destiny. If you didn't have to rate the book I wouldn't have even given it a 1 star rating.
3,"Thought-provoking, but not the last word","Denison offers a thought-provoking assessment of the state of the Christian Church in the western world, and makes some interesting recommendations for the manner in which he believes the Church should adjust its style, focii, and structures. While far from a comprehensive treatment of the decline of the institutional church as it exists (there can be no such thing while we're in the midst of the ""paradigm shift""), Denison provides a launching point for consideration of ""what now?"" as Christians in the West face being a distinctive minority in society for the first time in nearly 17 centuries.This book should be read and discussed in community -- either by a congregation's leadership team or in a group of clergy. While it is targeted towards Christian congregations, it could be expanded to synagogues, parachurch ministry leaders, and such."
2,Good content but hard to read pages,"This book has good content but it appears to be reduced by 50% or more from the original size, making it very hard to read. The copy quality is not so good either - fuzzy letters inside. (First publication date of 1903.) I had to enlarge the pages I wanted to read on a copier to read them without eyestrain.Overall it's worth the price for the family information inside, but be prepared for difficulty if you have any vision problems."
5,Read This Book If You Like Football!!!,"This is an excellent book to read. I loved this book!!! I suggest that kids who like football should read this book. Litearly,I read this book in 2 days."
4,Tough To Tackle,"Tough To tackle, by Matt Christopher, is one of his books about sports. This type of book is a realistic fiction book so it's not true but it can happen.This story takes place on a football field and happens from the months of September and October. Matt Christopher helps us know the characters by telling us what the characters do and how they act. The major conflict is that a boy named Boots Raymond really wants to play quarterback for his team called the Apollos, but Coach Hayes said that he's too heavy to play quarterback so he puts him on right tackle. Will Boots ever improve on his position? Matt Christopher's writing style interest me because he likes to write about sports all the time.This book would be great for 9-11 year old kids because this book is interesting and I would recommend it. I'd give this book a 4/5. A person that likes sports would like this book. So to find out if Boots will ever improve on his position, go get this book now at your local library."
4,This a book scored a touchdown. By BC from North Boulevard,"Tough to TackleThe book I am reviewing is Tough to Tackle, it is written by Matt Christopher. I think this book deserves four stars because it doesn't give enough details, but it was very descriptive book. This book is about Boots Raymond wants to play quarterback for the Apollos more than anything in the world. The problem is that because of his size, the coach tells him to play on the line. Boots hates playing tackle and almost quits the team. Boots has a brother in war and knows a lot about being apart of a team. His brother tells him some important things in football and offensive lineman. In the book Fighting Tackle who is also by Matt Christopher, it is a really good book because they are both kids who don't get to play there positions that they really like in football."
3,g-daddy's review,i thought it was a pretty good book because i like football. but but i think there should of been some more action and a little bit longer.i like the fact that boots didnt get to play quarterback and instead he had to play linemen and he ended up likeing the position. but i didnt like it that just because he wasnt quarterback he was gonna quit and if your gonna play a sport and you dont get your position then just dont quit cuz you could be better at that position.
2,Tough to .... Read,"This book was just pages and pages on details about 4 football games (plays called, players names) The actual story, about a boy who doesn't know if he wants to play or not because he's a tackle and not the quarterback encompassed about 10 pages of the book. The moral is a good one but it is just too difficult to get through 20 pages at a time about how much time is left or who ran which way. I know quite a bit about football and still wasn't interested."
4,Way better than I thought,This movie starring Hilary Duff is old but well done if a simple plot that are often in Hiliary's movies. The Guy gets the Girl in a military school. Good acting by her Female /Student Seargant and the Commander/Stepfather. Again not much too it but better than I thought. Well done Hilary Duff.
5,"Great, funny and entertaining movie!!","I've seen this movie one year ago and now I saw that the DVD will be released in June 28!! That's great!!I really like Hilary Duff, because I think she's an really good actress!!The movie is about a girl (unfortunately I don't remember her name) who lives with her mother. Then her mother made out with the head of an military academy school and so she had to move to this academy! Since then the problems began. She wasn't allowed to wear her normal clothes and she was forced to exercise every day!I think the movie was great fun and it's a good idea to buy it on DVD!!"
5,i love this movie,this is such a cool movie.i dont know how i would last without this movie. it teaches about the fun and the bad part of life. i personally think its a great teen/kids movie. hilary is awsome and acts pretty good for her age in the movie. goooo hilary. and gooooo cadet kelly. wonderfull movie!
5,"Charming , Disney magic!!!","I LOVE THIS MOVIE! SO A GOOD MOVIE.IF PEOPLE THINK IT'S BAD , THEN THEY ARE STUPID. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR EVERYBODY!"
4,Disney Channel Original Movie,"In one of her non Lizzie McGuire roles, Hilary proves to her audience that she can play various types of characters. This DCOM also has very friendly, family oriented values. A pleasure to watch."
3,good movie,this is a good family movie but if you find the price to be higher then 10 bucks i would suggest waiting until it gets lower. Maybe rent it first.
5,Very Good!,This is one of my oldest daughter's favorite movies. It is really good. Hilary Duff is great in movies. I highly recommend this one for the whole family. Enjoy!
5,hilary duff shines,"hilary fans, its here. its a must to have. hilary is so funny and so cute, watch it today."
5,What A Terrific Film,"I love this film so much! Its been a really long time since I last watched it, but I remember loving the father-daughter theme. I love that she gets two dads, and based on their personalities, they both love her in different ways. In addition, there's nothing like a guy in uniform who is handsome, intelligent, patriotic, disciplined, caring, humble, family-oriented, etc. The women/girls are also portrayed positively. Cadet Kelly maintains her bond with her old- and new friend, which is wonderful. She rocked as a cadet, and she made me proud to be a female. It's a great family film, so I highly recommend it to all."
4,good movie,"My seven year old daughter loves Hilary Duff and had to have this on DVD. I watched it with her and found it to be quite entertaining. It is not one of Hilary's best, but well worth the purchase for our collection."
3,Short and not too sturdy...,"I purchased this strap for my Casio watch which is still going strong after travelling the world with me. Unfortunately, the strap will not be travelling with me as it's broken after only a month. The strap looks and feels fine but it is very short (I had to use the very last hole to fit my wrist) and the buckle broke and flew off a couple of days ago. Luckily, I felt the watch slip from my wrist and didn't lose it. Of course, this might just be a manufacturing fault and I can't say that they would all break like this. Just be aware how short the strap is!"
3,does the work but cheap looking,Its worth for the buck. Right size for the watch and it comes with metal strap holders.But cheap looking and plastic buckle. I recommend this http://www.amazon.com/Voguestrap-TX18G1-Allstrap-Regular-Length-Watchband/dp/B00024WASO/ref=pd_sbs_watch_3 because its looks much better and metal buckle. But both worth for the price I have paid.
3,watch strap,The band fit well on my Timex watch but the metal fastening pin feels cheap such that it could break off.
2,Cheap Product,It was comfortable to wear but the buckle is made of plastic and broke within my two months of wearing it. I guess one can't expect anything more for a $3.99 watchband.
2,Fits-All brand does not fit all wrists,"I'm a big guy with 'normal' wrists. I usually remove links on metal watch bands; however, on this plastic band it is very tight on the last hole. Would think these straps would be made longer if designed for adults."
3,Straps too short if you have medium or larger wrists,"OK quality, especially for the price. The black plastic nylon straps are thinner and shorter than OEM Casio straps. Since the straps are about 1.5 cm shorter than the original OEM straps, if you have medium size wrists or larger you have very little strap length at the end to tuck into the buckle. As a result, the process of tucking the strap end into the buckle is pretty awkward. If you have medium or larger wrists, you should look elsewhere."
1,Bad quality!,"The strap buckle broke as i installed and tried my watch on for the first time, very cheap quality, did nt expect that. Dont buy it!"
1,Not the right size,It said it fit all Casio watches but did not. It was a waste. I would not order one again
1,low-quality cheap reprint of the wrong book,"such books should not be sold. The title is misleading: this is NOT the ""Vedic grammar"" most readers are thinking about - instead, it is the shortened version, ""The Vedic Grammar for Students"" (it actually says so inside of the book, but not on the cover). It is a very good book, too, of course, but those looking for the longer version should by no means buy this poorly photographed cheap edition. A real shame publishers are allowed to get away with such poor work."
4,rip a verse,"you can't see me I think you need glasses, skill is hard to come by but I make EZ passes, when I sign my name I just write dashes, I lace the track with the illest fashions, when I'm on the mic I be droppin science, buy me in the store I'm a rap appliance, just turn me on and I'll be droppin bombs, I spit urban psalms and I keep you calm"
5,"Not simple, not overwhelmingly hard, you will enjoy these.","I keep finding songs in this book whose melodies I remember, but I could've never named them. If your mind goes blank in the music store, this selection is broad. 150 gives you a lot to work with! Best of all, the arrangements are just right. It's not Dan Coates, making me feel frustrated at my lack of innate talent. Some songs will take some effort, most allow me to sound good on the second pass through. That's my definition of intermediate. It's a great collection for those of us who love playing for our own enjoyment and want interesting arrangements."
5,best songs ever - electronic keyboard version,"Better than I thought it would be. Simple, one handed sheet music for the novice with a keyboard that has build accompaniment. I'm sure someone more adept at the keyboard would find it lame, but it was just what I was looking for."
5,Beautiful music,And this music is written so I can play it either very simply or a little more in depth. It would take a long time to collect these pieces as separate sheet music.
5,Hours of memorable songs,"There are so many great tunes, and songs I knew but never knew the title. There is one song called ""Tammy"", I recognized it right away - it was played in the movie Animal House on the piano during the Omega rush party scene. I've been looking for the name of that tune for ages, and here it is."
2,TOO OLD!,"I'm either too young or have just never been enough of a broadway musical fan, but i received my songbook finally and i think i recognize three songs in it - one from snow white and one from the sound of music and another.Okay, i do know the dan fogelburg song and sting's song, but those to me shouldn't even be in the same group of ""most beautiful songs"" ever. there's a jim croce song, too. weird.i have never even heard of most of the musicals from which these songs are taken. still fun to play, but not the greatest arrangements i've ever heard ...."
3,WHERES LIKE GLUE???,"OK, LETS BREAK THIS ONE DOWN, SO IM GOING TO THESE SINGING LESSONS SO I CAN OPEN UP MY NATURAL ABILITIES AND I SPIED THIS BOOK IN THE BOOK SHOP AFTER THE SINGING TEACHER RECCOMENDED IT AND I CLUCTCHED IT AT ONCE...I WAS VIBING ON THE WAY HOME TO A BIT OF DUTTY ROCK, YOU KNOW? SERIOUSLY THOUGH I LOVE THAT ONE SONG LIKE GLUE, THAT IS SOME EMOTIONAL STUFF, WHEN HE SINGS ""STILL I GOTTA STICK TO MY GIRL LIKE GLUE..."" I FEEL THE EMOTION BEHIND IT, THE LONGING FOR STABILITY AND FOR HAPPINESS... SO WHEN I GOT HOME I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN THAT THE SONG IS NOT IN THE BOOK!!!! GET WITH THE PROGRAM!!"
3,"Good, simple books about Washington","This is a decent book, and a nice short read, although this kindle edition is rather plain (no illustrations). For anyone interested in understanding more about Washington, I also recommend this:Rules of Civility (Illustrated)"
1,Ugh - don't waste your time.,"Mitchell's writing begins to approach appeciable at the oddest times, and then falls flat when the need really calls (such as during the climax).The characters never develop, in fact the interactions often seem as if they were written, then jumbled up and put back together. Situations don't flow, conversations are contrived, and nothing seems congruous. I kept thinking, ""Just a few more pages and you'll fall into it..."" but that never happened.In fact, I turned the last page expecting there to be more, and when there wasn't, I honestly thought some pages were missing. I understand this is a series, but there was no meaningful path of the book.Awful. I hesitate to speak negatively of someone's writing because putting yourself out there must be difficult, and often tastes are just personal opinions. But... I felt strongly enough to do so!"
2,Kind of like smoking,"Although there is not a bit of literary merit, it is still an addictive read(paralled to smoking). The characters are paper thin, and so detached that I really had to muster even the tiniest concern over their otherwise wasted existences. I patiently waited for Will to shine, to have a moment, but alas his crippled Pa stole all the scenes. Tha Marquis was far too cliched and the erotica was weak. Advice- if you write S&m prepare to go hardcore. I hate to admit this though, I am eagerly awaiting the third instalment due to the anti-climactic end. My opinion: a good rainy day book."
2,a story as aimless as its characters,"Mary Ann Mitchell's Quenched reminded me a lot of the work of John Rechy in that it deals with aimless decadent characters, but this is where the comparison ends. Had Mitchell the talent of Rechy, she could have prevented this story of modern-day vampires from coming across as so dull and--well-- lifeless (sorry). This one doesn't even have the occasional S&M scene to defibrillate the meandering plotline like Sips of Blood."
4,An essential for fans of the Desert Sessions,"I don't know if I like this album as much as DS 7&8, but I felt compelled to review it after seeing young Chris's review.Young Chris, you are right. You are absolutely correct.You and your golden ears are the only ones who have ""paid attention to the lineup of Desert Sessions albums at all"". They get weird! They get all CRAZY! ZANY!The bottom line is that this is like ALL of the other Desert Sessions recordings. Never to see the light of radio, just cool musically-minded folks trying some new stuff.So it is musicians getting together and experimenting. So it has a harder edge, so what? It is still new and fresh and exciting.Not weird."
5,Awesome,"This CD is awesome. If your a fan of QOTSA then you have to get it. There is alot more texture to this CD then what QOTSA puts out, but it definitely rocks. I just wonder which of these songs will make it to the next QOTSA album."
3,"Laid back peyote tunes,,,,","Very cool CD...Josh and Deen Ween togeather is so cool. And PJ Harvey makes me want to touch myself...her voice is so good on this album! And the song ""Sheppards Pie"" reminds me of a ""Grateful Dead"" sing along. Also very early version of ""mak it wit chu"" is on here...very cool."
3,Not so impressive,I couldn't see the rings to well. I think ideal light would be needed to fully enjoy this toy. So far standard light doesn't make this an impressive toy
4,My daughter thought it was cool,"She liked it... for a while anyway! This is the type of toy where the novelty wears off rather quickly. It was easy to get set up, with an adult's help, and works just the way its supposed to."
3,Found on a CD,Although I have two of the songs on this album on tape I needed the songs on a CD. Because of your vase selection I was able to accomplish this goal.
3,Everyday use - Fine; not for formal setting,"This is a nice set by Royal Doulton for the price you pay. The absence of soup bowls retards it from being used as a formal place setting (unless you never plan on serving a soup course).The appearance and quality is good. The only drawback I have found is the inconsistency of the plates when stacked. Otherwise, your guests would never know that they are misformed.The lid for the sugar bowl does not fit properly and looks cheap - although that may merely be with the set I received."
2,Not durable,A dinner plate was broken during the shipment. Need to be handled with extra care. Not durable. But I thought it had good price and it looks nice.
5,A concise overview of world religions.,"The editor did an excellent job of focusing on and comparing critical aspects of the various world belief systems. Establishing a worldview that is truth, is livable, and is backed by reasonable evidence is essential to understanding our reason for existence. Comparing each world religion by the same standard allows the reader to adequately compare the significant and critical differences as well as the surface similiarities. Outstanding as a concise, comprehensive yet understandable, reference material. Highly recommend for any student of comparative religions."
1,A manual for converting non-Christians,This is not a book for those looking for an unbiased introduction of the religious traditions of the mankind. It gives a series of sketchy portraits of non-Christian religions with guidelines for proselytizing members of other faiths.
1,Anti Muslim Christian propaganda!!!,"I only read the section of this book dealing with Islam, and being Muslim I was deeply offended by this. I myself converted to Islam from Christianity and have extensively studied comparative religions. Coming from this background I could say that Mr. Dean C. Halverson's book in relation to Islam is not only inaccurate but is nothing more than a crude way of attempting to convert poor misguided Muslims."
4,Exceeded Expectations,"Wanted to order a book, 2 copies from Amazon, read the previews of the supporting vendor and took the plunge. I expected something would go wrong, like wrong book, not new, late delivery. To my surprise, I got exactly what I ordered, and received it a day or two earlier than expected. Great Job Amazon and a special thanks to Treasure Christian Books for delivering a perfect product.I'll shop again on Amazon."
5,It was perfect for my needs,"I got this book for my world religion class, it was in great shape and got here in time for my class, without paying for uber fast shipping and paying an arm and a leg. It was about the same price as if I would have went to the college book store which is a bummer, but still okay cause it got here in time for class. I would reccomend this seller, and the book had good though somewhat vaige descriptions of each religion."
3,Harbormick,"This book is a true relavation regarding the intolerance of Christianity, constantly reminding the reader of Jesus Christ being the one true savior. Once the reader has the common sense to overlook the bias of the authors it is really very funny i.e. Suggestions for Evangelism to Taosts, Approching Jewish People with the Gospel and the Evangelistic Do's and Dont's With Muslims. If you want to convert the world to Christianity this is a perfect start, it reads like an 18th century missionary primer."
2,"If you're not an evangelical, skip it","Although this book has interesting comparative charts of various world religions and christianity, and basically good summaries of those other religions, the entire slant is toward evangelizing people of those other faiths. This is evident in the text, but you needn't go that far: praises on the back cover come from two individuals that sound like they represent evangelical agencies, one man from Jews for Jesus, and the pastor of Southern Gables Church. The book contains hints on how to ""witness"" to those of other religions, ie., try to convert them, and attacks on things ""secular"" including the theory of evolution. I'm a modernist, I don't live in the 8th-century, and am not into such things, so I'll keep this on the back of the book shelf and avoid much of it to get at the basic summaries of the non-christian religions."
1,Another book of intolerance.,"I got this book as a gift from my sister because she knew I am interested in studying world religions. It's too bad she only looked at the cover and didn't bother to read it a little before buying it. This book is NOT an informative book on world religions. It's an Evengelical intolerant guidebook for witch hunters.Being a Wiccan, I was very offended by what the author wrote about the Wiccan religion. Not only is his ""information"" incorrect, but the entire book is biased against all religions except Christianity. One of the things he writes about the Wiccan religion is that ""It promises power, mystery, self-gratification, and rebellion against Christianity"" and this statement is completely false.This author is all about telling why Christianity is the ""right"" religion and that all others are wrong. Included in each chapter is a guide to converting people of each religion. I personally find this idea sick and twisted, and it should not be in a book about world religions."
2,Shallow,"As a Buddhist, I read only the section on Buddhism and my rating reflects only this part of the book.I was heartened that the author didn't make any of the grotesque factual errors that I often see in evangelical Christian coverage of Buddhism. However, the account was terribly superficial and the author demonstrated no true comprehension of Buddhist beliefs. It seems to me, as an evangelical tool, this chapter failed. I found that the tactics recommended for proselytizing to Buddhists were laughable and couldn't imagine them succeeding with a practicing Buddhist.I would encourage anyone wanting a more sophisticated presentation of Buddhism from a Christian perspective to read some of the offerings of Brother David Steindl-Rast, Father Heinrich Dumoulin, or Thomas Merton."
3,Cute Minnie,I don't consider stuffed toys very educational--just cute and fun. This one looks nice with other Disney characters on the toy chest.
3,Inuyasha: Incomplete Movies Box Set,"The movies that we did get were good but one movie was missing. It was a quality control issue ,at the factory, because the box set had not been opened. Movie 2 The Castle Beyond the Looking Glass was missing. I gave the box set as a gift. My son was disappointed when the set was incomplete but I had already thrown the paperwork out. I will need to repurchase it separately to complete the set."
3,Overpriced,"Let me start by saying that I love this show. The fact that I'm giving this only 3 stars has nothing to do with the show itself. I brought this when I started my Inu DVD collection a little while back, and I was pretty excited about it. Until I found out I could get the first 36 eps. in two boxed sets for roughly the same amount of money. Sure, this is a limited edition set, and it's worth something to collectors on that level. Also it comes with a desk calendar, which I love, but it's not really a good way to start your collection."
5,Great,"This is a great box set to get everything together. As explained however, there are regional restrictions on the DVD's, however with the right know-how or region-free DVD player you won't mind."
5,a must have,this is a must have for any inuyasha and any cartoon fan. each movie was great which is rare now a days. but pick it up u want b disappointed at all
4,Cool!,"When I bought this item, I thought it was too good to be true but this is a deal for Inuyasha fans. It is known that buying one DVD costs $25 or more so this was a really affordable gift for my friend. It has all 4 movies from Affections Touching Across Time to Fire on the Mystic Island. It has extra bonus footage which I enjoyed. I loved watching it. The picture & sound quality was excellent when I watched it on both my laptop & DVD player. I would recommend any diehard Inuyasha fan to have this collection!"
5,Inuyasha Box Set Movies,"I love this product! The movies are great, and I would recommend it. Great buy!"
5,so lovely,"i think this is a great album, it has a little blues on it. Paradis has an extrordinary voice, it is tender and lovely. I really like her version of Lou Reeds walk on the wild side. Serge Gainsbourg did a great job writing the lyrics of these songs."
2,Decent read,"This book does what the others have mentioned; it covers all of the basics and is to the point. Other books detail locations much better but again the book is not designed to be in depth. He references those books like Hurricane Treasure. My only worry was when I got to the part about detecting the Treasure Coast at high tide looking for treasure. I have talked to many people and done my research and nowhere else have I read to detect the high tide and chase the waves back in. He then goes on to mention to be cautious when waves are high and that it's fun detecting wet sand when it's not windy. Metal detectors LOVE high winds including nor'easters and hurricanes for the best chance at finding treasure and providing the cuts he had just finished mentioning. You can't love cuts and hate the winds that provide them... Maybe he got a bad reference here or maybe he is right, you decide."
1,Terrible product...and over-priced,"ridiculously complicated timer - requires 4 steps just to set the timer going. on top of that, it's WAAAAAAY over-priced. Returned for refund."
3,Hey Jeff Waters...,"Looking forward to the Exciter re-releases (as described on Blabbermouth), noticed new ones coming out on Megaforce on 3/15/05...please see:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index%3Dmusic%26field-fieldmap%3Dkeywords%3Aartist%26field-keywords%3Dexciter%26store-name%3Dmusic/104-2080380-7209554Are these them? Or just more that are similar to this version of ""Violence & Force""? (i.e. - not remastered by you)"
1,Evil Sinner??????????????????,"Why buy this if it doesn't have ""Evil Sinner"" on it?This is a classic album where the order of the songs is a must."
3,"Great Picture, but Poor Connectivity","This TV offers by far the best picture of any others in its price range. Placing it side by side with others clearly shows that it provides more of the image, while others look cropped.Howeve, not even a complaint to the Better Business Bureau could derive a correction for this TV's heinous flaw: it receives what the company says are ""weak signals"" from the VCR. My VCR is a Sony I paid $100 for--the most expensive in the store in this DVD age, yet I've never played a videotape, not even some new ones I bought of films that aren't likely commercially viable on DVD, where it didn't receive the so-called ""week signal"" and flash it's blue station identification ""Video"" up in the corner. It's extrememly distracting, and as a result, I put a pox on this company. Why they would think anyone would find this feature useful is beyond me. There is no way to disable it."
4,Good,It was good.The only problem was that it was not sealed when i received it. But it was ok. Thanks
1,Watered down sound,Simply lacking in the area of uniqueness without a doubt. Dave does turn in a nice performance with the guitar as usual but the songs sound like the band Simply Red or something. Gimme a break. Give yourself a break and pick up Amused To Death or Division Bell and leave this one to the diehards.
2,"Money, It's a Hit....","Never did totally hate it, but it definitely felt like a calculated attempt at cashing in on the band's name. What's more, it has that clean, major-label 80s production that muzakked many a song.Anyway, if you want to own the repuation and not the musicianship, this is the record for you."
3,It grows on you a bit,"The first time I heard this one, boy, did I hate it. It was really terrible. It started promisingly with ""Signs of Life"" and ""Learning to Fly"" but overall, it was really bad. ""On the Turning Away"" was also good, but everything else was bottom shelf material. But, a while later, I decided to give it another go. This time it was listenable. ""Dogs of War"" and both ""New Machine"" parts were still awful, but everything else was 'okay.'This album is still a sore dissapointment. Pink Floyd albums should be much more than 'okay.' Roger's writing is sorely missed, and Rick should have been allowed to re-enter the band, rather than be a session player. I'm sure his playing would have vastly improved this album.If new to Pink Floyd, skip this one. Buy ""Animals"" instead."
2,Sorry,"The only good songs on this album is ""Learning To Fly"" and the guitar intro to ""Sorrow"",the rest of that song is horrible"
2,Polly puts Roger to shame,"Momentary lapse is a fine slice of delicious tunes from the pink floyd. Gilmours'girlfriend is the best lyricist the band has ever had. Forget lines like ""all you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be"" and ""it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around"". When compared to the majestic poetry of a line such as ""I will I will she sighed to my request and then she tossed her mane"" those old lyrics seem like they were written by an ego maniac on some mid 70's binge.I want good, clean, safe product and thats what momentary lapse is."
3,Poor Man's Pink Floyd,"Not many signs of life here. A few tracks hold up...Dogs of War, On the Turning Away and One Slip are great songs, the rest is a mediocre David Gilmour solo album with 9 million studio musicians to pad out the sound, not the way I want to hear Pink Floyd."
3,"They tried their best, I think.","Pink Floyd without Roger Waters is basically the Chicago Bulls without Michael Jordan; a good team but not a great one. Here ""Pink Floyd"" tries their best to recover from Waters leaving the band. Roger was basically taking over the band and some felt 'The Final Cut' was somewhat of a solo album.'A Momentary Lapse of Reason' starts off awesome, but then falls short. It become really boring and unimaginative. At least they tried...."
4,Pink Floyd in the 1980's,"Momentary Lapse of ReasonI have to agree with some of the other reviewers who have reveiwed this record negatively. Yes, it has a more 80's sound than other records they released before it. They had to stay with the times to garner new listeners who might buy this record, like it, and then go back and buy some of their earlier records. So if you were looking for a Dark Side 2, then look somewhere else. If you want some good music by a group who, in my opinion, consistantly put out good records that you'll listen to more than once, then buy this record. You will give it repeated listens and like it more with each listen. I guarantee it. It's not their best record. If you want their best, buy Dark Side and The Wall and stop there. Especially if you are just a casual listener."
5,Momentary Lapse of Reason,"First and only concert I ever saw, have this album on cassette back from the 80's...gotta have it on CD. Love it. Classic Gilmour/Floyd."
3,Dawning Of A New Day,"It's simple, the David Gilmore (PINK FLOYD) compared to the Roger Waters (PINK FLOYD) is a much more melodic,uplifting less depressing (PINK FLOYD). I think Roger and Dave were an incredible team,and no dout that duo gave us some of the best music and lyric's around but unfortunately that's over so enjoy what David Gilmore's (PINK FLOYD) has to offer. There's something on this album for everyone,Instumentals,Balled Rock,Blue's Rock,Acoustic,Psycadelic,Melodic,Scary,and Anthem Like..."
4,Power and texture,This album synthesizes the pop sensibility that Pink Floyd has had for years without the theartics added by Roger Waters. It gives David Gilmour his due as the engine behind the music in this band. It stands up well by any standards. The band is more accessible to the public without Waters and the bizarre dimension it lacks with his presence is made up for with solid sonic continuity through the album's duration. The rhythmic theme used through the record give the band an underpinning not heard before and the music has more tribal appeal than I can remember in past Floyd albums. I am glad they have carried on to explore the textures of this insturmental giant. They pull the show off with remarkable brilliance live and have continued without missing a beat. A fine record that belongs in every Pink Floyd collection.
4,"""Where the speechless unite in a silent accord""","I'm a big fan of PF. I do agree this is not their best album... Nevertheless, and despite the 80's sound on it (specially on the drums), the lyrics are great. Sorrow, for instance, is a masterpiece (though I like the PULSE version a little more). On The Turning Away has a great solo, very Gilmour-like. I would not say this is a bad album. It was a new start... which would be concluded later on with The Division Bell. I guess you only need some time to get used to it, if you're new to Pink Floyd.For more experienced listeners, though, it is notable that the sound somehow went back a little. I think the Meddle sounds more 'alive' and 'Floydian'."
5,Gilmour followed perfectly,"What is wrong with some of you Floyd fans, Gilmour did an exellent job on this album and I believe that this is the last Floyd album because the Division Bell was so immature although the songs on it were catchy, but the lyrics were weak and it was still not Pink Floyd in style. AMLOR has a certain darkness to it when you listen to it (and when you look at the CD Booklet) and it really reminds you of the past Floyd days. Waters said it himself, Momentary Lapse Of Reason has good tunes on it. Even though the Division Bell nailed no. 1. I thought it was an immature album. Great job on this one Dave!"
3,Solid,"Though rooted in 80s sounds, Momentary is a pretty solid album. Signs of life is inventive and ecocative , whilst Learning to Fly is one of their mopst accessable and enjoyable tracks, showing that synths can be a force for good! Though it never actually sounds too much like Pink Floyd, the album is a hearty slab of space rock, which sould appeal to fans of Tangerine Dream's Legend soundtrack: it's mystical, but as long as you don't take youself too seriously, you should like it"
4,Very Good,"After Roger Waters left Pink Floyd, he thought Pink Floyd was nearing its end. Dave Gilmour decided to take the helm, and this cd is an attempt to get back on track. It succeeds, but not nearly as well as ""The Division Bell"", the following cd.Nevertheless, this is good Floyd. Dave Gilmour's guitar work is wonderful, especially on songs such as ""Terminal Frost"", ""Yet Another Movie"", and ""Sorrow"". ""Learning to Fly"", ""One Slip"", and ""On The Turning Away"" are catchy songs. Missing is the wonderful orchestration of ""The Final Cut"".While this cd is mostly Dave Gilmour, if Roger Waters could do a solo Floyd record, than so could Dave Gilmour."
3,"Another ""solo"" Floyd album","And as with The Final Cut another decent one but for different reasons. With Roger gone Dave and Co. finally got the chance to show what they could come up with and what they delivered was a FAR from great but still above average album.There's no concept for the first time since 1972's Obscured By Clouds. But don't let that put you off.A New Machine Parts 1&2 and The Dogs Of War are awful, Yet Another Movie/Around And Around is dull. However the rest of the album gets it just right. The instrumental tracks Terminal Frost and Signs Of life are good and whilst On The Turning Away does seem a little bit out of place it's still an enjoyable track. Learnign To Fly is a decent and popular ""single"" and finally Sorrow and One Slip not only prove that the band still have the ability to come up with memorable and genuinely great music Gilmour proves with these two songs that WHEN he tries he CAN write decent lyrics."
5,really good,"This was one of Pink Floyds CD's that I did not buy. I didn't think thaat floyd would sound right without Waters. but on day I was toodling along the used discount section in the closest music store and found this for 5 bucks. I thought ""why not"". I got home and listened to it and I was amazed how good it was. It was good to get away from all the Waters songs about either going crazy or Cyd Barret. I really liked learning to fly and the dogs of war the best. all of the songs are good to listen to also. It is very good and I think this is a great buy. I recommend it to everyone."
4,Floyd continued,"Great continuation of Pink Floyd's later phase (after Sid Berret). Good album, even after having lost Roger Waters. Right now, I am into a very 80's phase, and A Momentary Lapse of Reason fits well. Yes it has a strong 80's style, but the music is great, especially David Gilmore, Richard Wright, and Tony Levin(great bassist). I'm glad that Floyd continued their ambient, mysterious sound in this album."
3,The Surrogate Band,"In 1987, after a lengthy court case and bad blood, David Gilmour, and Nick Mason decided to carry on as Pink Floyd. The result was the album ""A Momentary Lapse Of Reason"". The songs arent so bad, in fact they are quite catchy. The only thing missing is Roger Waters unifying vision. This album sounds like a David Gilmour solo album. But he had an army of session musicions to assist him in the production. Bob Ezrin (The Wall) also produced and co-wrote several tracks. Its a very enjoyable album with strong songwriting, but to me it doesn't meet Pink Floyd standards."
3,Floyd W/O Waters--Are You Kidding?,"This album merits 3 stars istead of 1 beacuse there are about 3 strong tracks(Learning to Fly,On the Turning Away, One Slip)that kick otherwise this album is a disaster. It lacks the conceptual style of Waters. It lacks the lyrics that Waters could have given to this album. Yes, I am biased towards Waters because he is the best part of The Floyd. Without Waters, the circle is broken(for example, only 3 contributed to the final cut(wright was absent), but Waters was there and that album was magnifique.Momentary Lapse is too ""top 40 solid gold type"" to be true Floyd.(Division Bell was about the same, but comparitively better than Momentary Lapse)"
3,"el Peor De PinkFloyd, pero mucho mejor que millones de LPs","este es el disco de pink floyd que menos me gusta, no por eso es un disco malo, en realidad los solos de guitarra son muy buenos, la cancion ""learning To Fly"" es magnifica, y la produccion en realidad es buena, el problema es que muchas veces el disco cae en un rock ""easy listening"" que en realidad no me agrada mucho viniendo de PF, buen disco a pesar de todo"
2,Not worth the money,"Basically a David Gilmour solo effort, this album lacks the thematic cohesion and lyrical ability of earlier Floyd albums. ""Signs of Life"" is a good introduction with its quiet ambient sounds, and ""Learning to Fly"" is one of my favourite Floyd songs. But the rest of this album doesn't appeal to me because it's so lame and uneven. ""Terminal Frost"" and ""A new machine part 1+2"" are pretty much filler, ""On the turning away"" is very pathetic but hollow, ""Sorrow"" is unlistenable for me because of this ugly guitars. David Gilmour doesn't leave out a chance to trap into art-rock cliches. Stay away from this album and buy some of Floyd's '70s work."
4,Ethereal,"I had the pleasure of hearing A Momentary Lapse of Reason during my first year of college. I was relatively new to Pink Floyd then and I've got to tell you, it was this album that got me hooked. ""Learning to Fly"" was and still is one of the most incredible songs I have ever heard. Although in the past Pink Floyd's music belied their search for the meaning of life in a muddled, drug addled way, they were finally able to embrace the enlightenment that comes with time and maturity. That being said, the mystical moments displayed on this album ring genuine to me. ""Learning to Fly"" is Gilmour's enlighened moment, drawn from personal experience. ""On The Turning Away"" breaks through towards the end. And Sorrow is just a masterpiece. This album was the epiphany that led to The Division Bell. David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Rick Wright's playing on this album is the result of the serenity and wisdom that comes from ""having been there and done that."""
2,Dehydrated,"""Without Waters"" that is. I doubt that Roger could have done much to help this mess of a CD, since his contemporary CD ""Radio KAOS"" is barely any better. This CD has one good song, the catchy ""Learning to Fly"", and even it starts to lose its pizazz after 20 or so listens. Most of the hardcore Pink Floyd fans I know tend to be of the ""Worship Our Philosophical Musician Gods"" mindset. They seem to find deep philosophical meaning in laughable lyrics, worship the singers as near-deities, and rationalize themselves into thinking that awful songs are splendid masterpieces. Being of a more objective mind, I find almost nothing to like about this CD other than the aforementioned Learning To Fly. It's inoffensive enough to serve as background music. Can't say much more for it than that."
5,Thank god for this remaster,"Being a Pink Floyd fan since the 1970s, I've amassed a huge collection of their music. I remember being really excited for this album when it hit in 1987. At the time, it was quite controversial being the first album without Roger Waters. As much as I hate to say this, this album needed remastering from the day it was released. Even the ""remaster"" that was included in the original Shine On boxed set didn't sound as good as it should have. Thankfully this re-release fixes that. Gone is the muddy, bled-together sound, replaced by crystal clear bliss. Nothing seems buried in the mix this time around. The subtleties are all there, so slap on the headphones and enjoy!"
1,Lapse of Reason is Right.,Really this isn't even a Pink Floyd album. It's Gilmores attempt at a solo under the Pink Floyd Name. The band needs Rodger Waters back because without him they are less than mediocre.
1,Pink Floyd is no longer Pink Floyd,"This is a pathetic album, that brings tears to my eyes. It has that awful 80s sound too it and lacks even 1 decent track. Pink Floyd should have died after Water's left.*sigh*"
1,There's no life after Waters,"When I first heard this album in 1987 I liked it. Then I listened closely to the words and wondered where the imagination and creativity of Floyd had gone. To make matters worse, I saw the Waters-less version of Floyd in concert that year, on their highly touted tour. The show was like an AM radio greatest hits session. I walked away more disappointed than ever.The magic isn't gone, but you need to listen to Obscured By Clouds, Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, and The Final Cut to find it. Gilmour is a great musician, but he's no poet.Take away the words and Momentary Lapse of Reason is OK..."
1,Momentary Lapse of Inspiration,"Can Pink Floyd be without Roger Waters and still make awe-inspiring albums? Apparently not. I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan, but this is the lamest excuse for a progressive rock album since Yes in the middle 70s. The lyrics are inane, the songs drag, and David Gilmour's voice gets on my nerves after 15 minutes into the album. ""The Final Cut"" is not inspired either, but this one has even less to offer."
1,post pink floyd rubbish,"In 1987, I bought this with naive anticipation. I knew this was the first Waters-less PF album, but I didn't really realize what they had lost. It does vaguely sound like a PF album but somehow it's profoundly boring. It is worthwhile in the sense you can properly judge the importance of Roger Waters; however, it is a tedious listen. You may not like every PF album, but nobody can deny Waters pushed himself lyrically and musically. Gilmour struggles to recapture a former sound causing himself to (artistically speaking) ""run in place."" I've always tried to pinpoint the major weakness on this disc, from Gilmour's girlfriend's uninspired lyrics to the band's weak songwriting, but it's become futile. I've come to the conclusion that there is no single weakness; it's simply a recording that should never have taken place, and in my mind it's not even part of the PF discography. The Final Cut is just that. Anything that is post 1983 is post Pink Floyd."
2,Not a real Pink Floyd album,"David Gilmour and Nick Mason are the only credited members of Pink Floyd that appear on this album while Rick Wright is listed as a session musician. However, PF without Roger is the least of the problems with this.Gilmour was a great frontman for the Floyd in the early 1970s who contributed great classics like Green is the Colour, The Nile Song, The Narrow Way, Fat Old Sun and Fearless. But on this album, he completely caves in to the crappy musical style of the 80s -- heavy on synthesizers, female backup singers, etc.In fairness, many great 1970s rock groups produced a lot of crap in the next decade as well and it seems that even THE Pink Floyd weren't immune to this.I give this CD 2 stars because I don't see it as a complete failure--the song ""Sorrow"" is kind of interesting and I could see it as a half-decent song if it was recorded with that 1970s classic Floyd sound."
2,Disappointing,"I've noticed that most of the reviews on this album are long and meandering, so I'm going to keep mine concise. While ""Momentary Lapse of Reason"" is better than most other music that came out in the 1980's, it is disappointing to a rock (and, for that matter, Pink Floyd) fan. The lyrics, while not bad, are not all that good, either. The worst part, however, is the bland and formulaic music. The only track I truly appreciated on this album is ""Signs of Life"". Frankly, I'm going to sell my copy."
2,YUK!,"Definitely Pink Floyd's worst album, the only songs worth listening to are ""Learning To Fly"" and ""On The Turning Away"". ""One Slip"" was bearable as was the beginning of ""Sorrow"", but in general this album was garbage. Nothing but session musicians will you find on most of the tracks here. After Waters left the band, PF should have just broken up; this is junk."
5,mashty,just the get the record straight.....lapse is one of the best pink floyd albums. Learning to fly and ON the turning away are all time classics. It was a needed experience for pink floyd.
5,Pink Floyd,Classic Floyd with Gilmore taking the lead. Takes you on its own journey as do most Floyd albums. Listen completely through and let it take you somewhere. Absolute classic.........
3,Momentary Lapse of Reason,"Favorite track on this is Learning to Fly; this really shows PF's change when you compare this with same track on Pulse. Love all PF but won't put this anywhere near the top of their stuff. I'm same age as David Gilmour so have really become attached to their music over the many, many, many years."
4,I've always like this disc,even though it is not one of the best by Floyd it is still a better than good disc. I have it in the player fairly often so that says something.
1,THREE Re-masters?? COME ON !,"I bought the 1997 ""re-master"" and it sounds awful - very harsh and brittle and compressed. If these sound engineers don't know what they are doing, the buying public should not have to pay for their incompetence! If a re-mastered re-master of a re-master comes out, the original re-master should be recalled by the manufacturer as a defective product and replaced at no charge! The only way they are going to stop making these multiple re-masters is if it starts costing them money because money NOT MUSIC is the only thing they understand."
2,floyd but not really floyd,"This album is not so bad if only they came up with something original. As someone indicated earlier, the first side (for those who bought the LP more then 10 years ago) is not so bad. There is decent stuff like Learning to Fly and On the Turning Away. The rest is just forgettable drivel taking snippets of other ideas from their past albums and trying to market what people expect to be the ""floyd"" sound.The reason why people enjoy Floyd is because of their inventiveness and the lyrics. People also say ""Well, we don't need poets like Waters, what we need is music."" Just remember that an album is more than just it's packaging people."
5,A monumental Floyd album beyond Waters!,"It was a triumphant return of a band we thought we wouldn't see again, with David Gilmour at the helm this time. Beginning with the eerie instrumental ""Signs of Life"" right through to the ripping ""Sorrow"", the album defined the sound of late '80s rock without losing that classic ""Pink Floyd"" sound.At the same time this was released, Roger Waters put out his solo ""Radio K.A.O.S."", which in its own right, was a success, too. One can't help but wonder if all four members had put their musical styles together, might we have had another ""Dark Side of the Moon""?By the way, this Pink Floyd album was indirectly responsible for me finally losing my virginity. Thank you!"
3,"decent, says one with an unbiased eye.","i am not a pink floyd expert, which i feel allows me to write a review that is impartial and unbiased. i dont give a flying monkey who was in the band when what album was made. my overall opinion of this one is that it is a decent cd, not good or bad. I like it for ""on the turning away"" which i greatly enjoy, as well as the funky ""a new machine, Part I and II"". the rest of the cd is indifferent, i feel that some of the introductions are pretty long and boring and some others are weird in a negative way. i borrowed this cd from a friend, and personally would not purchase it."
5,Good PF rocker on this one,"AMLOR is a great PF album. I always enjoyed Floyd for the music rather than lyrics and so depart from the judgments of many of the Waters fans here. Floyd's progressive mix of R&B and dissonant guitar-driven sounds set them apart and it's on display here much more so than the followup Division Bell. This may be a Gilmour album in all but name, but that ain't necessarily a bad rap."
4,The First Pink Floyd CD I ever heard!,"This was the first Pink Floyd CD I ever listened to, and this one sold me on the group. I'd never really heard music like this before, and there's not another group today that even comes close to their sound. These guys know how to make music, how to use the music in ways that others wish they could. With today's music so focused on the lyrics, its great to be able to just get into the music."
2,borrrrrrrrrrrrrrrring,"this sounds like a david gilmour solo record. sure i'd be the first to tell you that roger waters is an egocentric ass, but without him, there is no pink floyd. no, let me clarify that--without waters and gilmour TOGETHER, there is no pink floyd. so, i guess that means pink floyd is dead...let's put this one to bed."
3,Gilmour's Third Solo Album,"This is really David Gilmour's third solo album. Rick Wright and Nick Mason play very small parts on an album that is dominated by session musicians. ""Learning to Fly"" and ""One Slip"" sound less like Floyd tunes and more like bad 80's synth trips. Look elsewhere."
3,Expertly Performed and Produced. Totally Useless.,"Absolutely forgettable. The lyrics are a bore. No real vision to the album at all.That said, it must be said that the performances are of the highest standard. The band is in very good form. If only the material was up to their level."
4,"Not classic floyd, but good nonetheless","Some people seem upset that this isn't like traditional Pink Floyd; that hasn't bothered me, since I just discovered Pink Floyd recently and haven't had time to get used to their ""sound"". If you're looking for something the same as their other albums, this may not be what you want, but give this album a chance. I've definitely enjoyed it."
1,Cesspool of [poo],"This is NOT Pink Floyd. Never was, never will be. This is David Gilmour doing a solo album and trying to do the 80's pop sound that was SO loved at the time. Hasn't aged well. I don't think Nick Mason and Rick Wright did ANY songwriting on this album. ..."
2,The disc for dad,"One of their worst no doubt, perhaps not as abysmal as some make it out, but does that really say anything? This late 80's backfired comeback is drenched in lifeless production, half-cooked experimentation, and exploited past glories (particularly how Gilmour tries in vain again and again to relive the heights of his ""Comfortably Numb"" guitar solo throughout these hollow compositions), producing their definitive over-50 album for tailgate parties."
1,Over synthesized mess,"I have all the old LPs but had lost track of Pink Floyd since ""The Wall"". What a mistake to purchase this crap. The division bell is even worse. The singing is less than pleasant, forced and strained from a worn out rocker. The music is a jarbled New Age sounding studio mix of repetitive beats. Water's was correct when he said Pink Floyd was a spent creative force. If there is a message in the album or a theme its obscured by clouds of senseless notes and endless whaling guitar riffs. I think Gilmour wanted some retirement money and kicked out the last two PF albums to grow old on easy street. Or he followed the path of Sid Barret and slid off the deep end."
1,AVOID!!,"This is the worst of all Pink Floyd's albums - If like me you are a fan of classic Floyd you are going to find this mess of a album a big disappointment. Big on synthesizers and small on ideas it sounds like the soundtrack of a second-rate American cop show. Contains the ridiculous track ""Learning to Fly"" unfortunately this is the high point of the whole album, it nose dives into the ocean after this."
3,"Well, it's Pink Floyd but...","...I didn't quite like it. After Waters left the group only the Division Bell seems to be 'great' as opposed to almost-everything done during the Waters age. It's too slow, no catchy tunes."
2,"Unlike most Pink Floyd, This one is Uninspiring.","I really love Pink Floyd. Each of their albums offer a very different selection of songs. However this one is quite bland. The songs all melt together, so I can't even say which are good and which are bad. It is obvious that after Water's left, the band did have to reinvent itself, just as it did after Syd Barrett left after ""Piper at the Gates of Dawn."" This album is easy to overlook, and I don't suggest getting it unless you want to complete your collection."
1,no no,No no what is this!!!!!!!!!????? This is not Pink Floyd. Dont buy this Record. Mr Gilmore is made his own songs. This is light pop music. Mr Gilmore; Dont destroy Pink whith a album like this. I hate the new Pink Floyd!!!!!!!!!!!
3,2011 Remaster-a disappointment,"This rating is for the 2011 release - NOT the album !!! I own this in the original vinyl, a cassette, and a 1990's CD issue. A friend dropped the 2011 version by for a comparrison. I used a dual tray player to make the comparison a bit easier and to keep everthing on a level playing field. The first thing that really jumped out at us was the lack of dynamics in this version. It is just not as engaging or as powerful as the earlier version. This is the same issue I had with the SACD of Wish You Were Here. Upon closer inspection, I discovered what I belive is the major differance - the earlier versions were mastered by Doug Sax - the ""godfather of mastering"" and supervised by James Guthrie. Mr. Guthrie took on this project without Mr Sax for this issue. WOW - what a differance. My suggestion is to stick with the older versions of these Floyd CD releases, if you must do digital."
5,Amazing!,"I don't know anything about the history of Pink Floyd, nor do I care to. I recognize great music when I hear it. This is great music."
3,"A good listen, but not to be confused with the real thing","This album succeeds in one way, and fails in another. To Gilmour's credit, AMLOR has some very well-done, well-written songs (One Slip being the standout) that have immediate hooks and enough substance to make you want to put it into your CD player every now and then, and, despite my opinion that Waters was the driving force behind Pink Floyd (check out Amused to Death, perhaps the last real Pink Floyd album, for proof), it is a much more enjoyable and less dated than Radio KAOS, which was released in '87 as well. However, it does not have the same brilliance of its predecessors, from Atom Heart Mother to the Final Cut. The album is, at times, sterile, wimpy, dull, and perhaps pompous as well. This album is best suited if you are either (A) a PF fan who wants a change of pace or (B) a beginner with PF who finds DarkSide or the Wall to weird or scary."
4,Water-less Floyd,"I remember when this album first came out, was it '87? I bought it blindly, not knowing what I'd find. I was NOT disappointed! This album isn't DSOTM,WYWH, or even Animals. It is as good as ""The Wall"" even without Roger Waters. I loved ""A New Machine"" (both parts) but, my favorite song on this album is ""Terminal Frost"", this took me back to Dave's first solo album ""David Gilmour"" and also to Rick Wright's ""Wet Dreams"". The direction was more jazzy/fusion and I wish that They had done more of this type of music all along. If only Roger, Dave, Rick and Nick could get past their differences and move on to making new legends."
3,Pink Floyd's First without Waters,"This isn't bad but It isn't great either. Thankfully it doesn't sound like the last 2 dreadful releases,but this is average at best. Fave includes ""Learning To Fly"". Division Bell would be one of Floyd's best ever."
2,So-so and definitely not Pink Floyd,"I'd have a lot more respect (though no more love) for this album if it was released as a David Gilmour solo album (which it is in all but name) but having recently listened to this album again, it's aged even worse than I remember. It is on par with Gilmour's second solo album which is to say it has brief moments of beauty but is mostly forgettable. This album is as much a pop album as About Face was but at least that didn't masquerade as a Pink Floyd album. I find all of Floyd's albums from Meddle onward to still be relevant today but this is dispensable. Check out On An Island if you want to hear Gilmour's talents (or Division Bell which is far better than this)."
5,One of the best.,"I would agree with other reviewers, a listener has to take the time frame that Pink Floyd's music was written into account. A person cant look at this album in the context of the 70's Pink Floyd and compare it as bad or worse. Pink Floyd's music has grown and matured at any person does in their own life (at least some people). Yes, this album is sans Roger Waters. It was time to move beyond the war and angst and childhood scars. The Wall was enough, The Final Cut was too much, get on with life. Thats what this album was. David Gilmore is a deeper more pensive lyricist. Both the music and lyrics of this album attest. Its like good poetry, you have to keep looking for the hidden deeper meaning. If you dont get a poem the first time you read it, it doesnt mean the poem is crap. With this album Pink Floyd keeps that dark melancholic and enigmatic thread that can be found in most of their albums. If you are looking for the sound of Dark Side or The Wall, that was then. This album is now."
2,May Help With Sleep Problems,"How appropriate that beds are on the cover, as this is the first of Pink Floyd albums that qualifies as just a collector's item for Floyd fanatics and will positively put anyone else (and some fanatics like myself) to sleep. There are so many great Floyd albums, don't buy this one unless you are curious about the ""bad Floyd album"" and want to see if it could really be that bad... it is not that it's terrible, but just for Floyd, it is extremely mediocre."
1,MY FAVORITE FLOYD SONG.,"I THINK MOST PEOPLE EITHER LOVE OR HATE PINK FLOYD. I WAS ONE OF THE LATTER. THE OPENING NOTES OF ""MONEY"" DRIVE ME UP THE WALL. BUT ""ON THE TURNING AWAY"" IS THE BEST FLOYD SONG I'VE EVER HEARD. I'M TEMPTED TO BUY THE ALBUM TO GET THE SONG. I DON'T SUPPOSE I'VE HEARD ANY OF THE REST OF IT."
2,The worst Floyd's album,"Waters and Gilmour need each other. If you could mix ""Final Cut"" and this record at the same time, you'd have a masterpiece! But Gilmour, an excellent musician, was not inspirated as a composer here (and he's an excellent melodist too!). Except ""On the Turning Away"" (fantastic), the remaining songs are very acessable and pop. ""Dogs of War"" is, in my opinion, the worst Floyd's song. But, fortunately, ""The Division Bell"" is a redemption."
2,It says Pink Floyd but......,"It is not ""real"" Pink Floyd. I like what another reviewer said: Pink Fraud. When this cd was released I was one of the first in line and I kind of liked it. I really wanted it to be good and I wanted to ignore the facts. The fact is: the emotional, talented, egotistical, visionary, great lyrical and essential part of Pink Floyd is gone. What was left is three great musicians with huge lifestyles that need to remain the same or get better. I guess in a way I can't blame them. They have something to market and it will sell. They have had a few bright spots, but other than that they hover right around or below mediocre."
2,A permanent lapse of creativity,"Once Roger Waters left Pink Floyd, there was simply no reason for the band to carry on (other than the money, that is). Guitarist David Gilmour, as he showed previously on two decent but hardly vital solo albums, is a good singer and a fine guitarist--but only a mediocre songwriter. Waters's vision is missed by his former bandmates in so many ways that it is difficult to fathom. For example, give a listen to the turgid ""Dogs of War"" and compare it to anything on the masterpiece album ""Animals."" Enough said."
2,Very Dull,"Although ""The Division Bell"" (94) is a great piece of music, ""Momentary Lapse"" misses Roger Waters sorely. Gilmour attempts to imitate Waters' bitterly ironic and clever lyrics - a big mistake, as ""Dogs of War"" will show. ""Learning To Fly"" is a very nice song, and ""On The Turning Away"" sounds great indeed. The rest of the album, however, is the sound of a band with no direction (probably because it was mostly played by studio musicians - Rick Wright's playing is missed). Do yourself a favor and make this the last addition to your Floyd collection."
4,YES! this is a PINK FLOYD ALBUM!!!!,"First, let's get this debate about it not really being Pink Floyd w/o Wafers over. The first front man in the band was Syd Barrett and who was Barrett's friend and taught him to blay the guitar before he joined Floyd....well that would be David Gilmour. When Barrett was getting a little too trippy to bring off the performances Gilmour came in to help out, Barrett's behavior got to the point where he was no longer a muscial member of Floyd, and the rest is history. So, this is a Floyd album. Is it the best? No. But, I'd put it in the top 5 with The Wall, Dark Side of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, and Animals. For those others who thinks it just re-hash Floyd then listen to the previous 4 oldies I mentioned and this one and there is nooo wayyy you can say that. Hell, its music and not politics or religion so ... enjoy the album."
2,Adequate,"Recorded after the loss of Waters and the loss of interest of Wright and Mason, A Momentary Lapse in Reason is a Gilmour solo album, basically. Bohemian works like Learning to Fly and Sorrow are passionate enough to work well. Sympathetic weeps for humanity such as On the Turning Away or Dogs of War come off as flaky and pompous. Waters knew how to display intellectual tendencies without coming off as pretentious. He also knew how to make music that is timeless while this album, with its high pitched keyboards and its constant unneeded guitar solos, sounds unmistakably 80s. The more personal aspects of Gilmour's music, heard on his self-entitled solo album and Pink Floyd's The Division Bell work best. Only for Pink Floyd completionists."
4,Dog pleaser solution,"My dog loves this ball, and normally he is quite good about not destroying things, but I was worried about him damaging his teeth on it. We put it instead a hex rubber ball (about 8 inch round ball with hex shaped openings) it still makes all the noises and he can no longer get his teeth on the Babble Ball."
4,My dog loves this!,"I bought this for my toy breed dog hoping it would entertain her while I was busy/away - and it does just that! The ball makes multiple sounds, from cricket chirps to barking to wildcat growls. After pawing the ball a few times, my timid dog got over any fears and is now completely fascinated. The battery is replaceable, which is great as so many noise-making toys eventually stop working.The only difficulty I have with this toy is that it is hard plastic (to keep the inner workings safe I assume) and still a bit large for some smaller breed mouths, so when it rolls under furniture someone has to retrieve the ball. This is now my dog's favorite toy, and even the smallest movement activates sounds. If you place this on uneven tile, be prepared to hear lots of noise!"
1,dog did not like,The toy is very hard plastic and easy to set off. If you walk close to it it will make noice. Also there is no off switch. My dog toyed with it for a few minutes then got sick of the noice. May work for some pets. DO NOT LEAVE PETS ALONE WITH THIS. It will break into sharp pieces.
4,Pickin' Cotton,"It isn't Poco but if your a Fan it is good to have. Makes good background music.""Not out of mind"" stands out as the best original on the album. If you've never heard Poco's ""Bad Weather"" or ""Ride the Country"" Then you might really like these two songs. There is no improvement. The Poco recordings are better. For someone who has heard them, it is still okay. Only kind of a reflecting the past kind of feeling I get from these. I really like ""All the way to you"" an instrumental. ""There's a River"" has a great refrain and some good guitar playing.I really love Paul Cotton's contributions to Poco so I was afraid there was a great song that I was missing out on. So I bought this CD. I was right."
4,nearly good as poco,I just happen to fine this by looking to see if poco was still around what a find if poco can come up with a new cd this good we will be lucky if you like poco you will like this too
4,Great Recording,This is an excellent recording. An album that will definetly please the fans that know of Paul from his work with Poco.
3,IT is not so great,"Well in performance I don't think it is a big deal, but I'm comparing it with an axis 206. For it's price it is ok, at least if it is all that matters, but I rather prefer an axis camera.Pros:nice lookpriceCons:not so high fpsnot so well quality of image(but ok for it's price)And about the software, I don't know, I don't use it.Conclusion:If you just want it for monitorig not so big areas it will do the job, and about it's zoom not a big deal.Just remember that it is cheap!!!!"
3,BL-C1A-S set-up on Mac Pro OS X 10.5 Leopard?,"Sorry, not network savvy. Anyone help here?Thanx in advance for your help.Customer service walked me through connectivity problems.Works fine now. WooHoo!"
1,Crappy webcam should work on any computer - it is the 21st century!,"I'm so mad at this thing. Even mac gurus could not help me to get this thing working. I thought that it could be accessed just like any other IP device, and hacked into working, but this thing would not work with my fios router. It was so frustrating to find out that the valentines gift for my wife was nothing more than a paperweight."
2,Not for automation - good for on-demand preview,"1) Automatic Setup does not work in Windows XP. It never completes. Defaults to static ip connection. It is easy to setup manually. 2) IE friendly. No zoom functionality on Firefox 3) Inherent problem with camera taking pictures. Camera periodically delivers a snapshot in greenish filter and hence considers it a motion . This is a camera problem. This affects both built-in motion detection and Motion software in Linux. Another issue is that sometimes the snapshot crops top 20 rows of pixels and appends that at the bottom of the images. This also triggers a motion. Due to this, you get bogus motion alerts. Hence, it is not worth for security automation. Bottom line: waste of money"
2,Not so good,Takes pretty good pictures in good light. Low light performance is pretty bad and the only avaiable format is mjpeg which is pretty bandwidth intenstive. Frame rate is also pretty low.
2,Halfway there,"I think this is an excellent concept and the customer service is outstanding. However, your ISP and router will determine whether you can view the cam remotely. I have AT&T using the 2wire router and it is not able to open the port required by the manufacturer. I spent 3 hours working on this and found that AT&T doesn't offer a router in my area that would integrate with this webcam. I'm not saying you should not purchase this item, I'm suggesting you do your homework before purchasing."
2,Frown,"This was the first IP Camera that I purchased. The BLC1A is an ""OK"" camera with an ""OK"" picture for the price. User Friendly and free to access the camera through viewnetcam.com. I recently purchased 2 more Panasonic IP cameras (BL-C121) that was more money and had more features. It has a very poor quality picture which I am rating as a 0 to 1. The BLC1A was better and that I only rated as a 2 for the money. Now that I have seen other cameras, and what they can do for less money, I will not buy another Panasonic."
4,Good Camera for the money.,"This product is clear and the instructions are well written. I use my iphone to monitor my camera, which is great! I've had it for about 4 months now, and i have no problems with it."
1,Expensive and Short-Lived Power Adaptor,"I have no complaints against the installation or operation of the camera. It is designed to work as expected. Its AC power adaptor, on the other hand, will cease to operate in a couple of months. So far, I went through 3 adaptors in less than a year and a half. It took me a while to locate the cheapest original adaptor online at a cost of about $32 a unit including shipping. It also took me a longer while to locate the Panasonic support that deals with part warranty (not the camera or the part sales division). Incredibly, the support folks had no idea that the adaptor itself has a two-year warranty. Therefore, they did not know how to deal with it. They played dumb and deaf whenever I followed up with a call. In short, I would rate camera 5, adaptor 1, support service 1."
2,Max 1 frame every 3 seconds internet viewing,"Title says it all. This camera offers a maximum of 1 frame every 3 seconds internet viewing. I can view motion over the LAN, but that doesn't provide much value since this is intended to be a remote/internet camera. Returned the product. Get a Sharx. They cost a little more, but work as described and have many more useful features - including continuous recording to a shared folder."
3,Using my Apple wireless router.,"The camera does a good job, hooks into my wireless home network, but I still haven't been able to see it online, appears to be a problem with the Apple wireless router and the camera's format or something. Not quite sure how to make it work. Since it has worked on my home network, I am not sure why I can't get it to work online too."
4,Great Camera,"I have two of these cameras and they do a great job monitoring the front and rear of my house. I acutally have them outside, under the porch, though they aren't made for outdoors. We'll see how well they work when the temp drops this winter... I have them set to e-mail images while we are gone. havent' been able to get the viewing over the internet to work yet, but I think it's a router issue. Worth every penny..."
3,Complicated setup for cell phone use,"The in-home camera setup was fairly easy. If you want to view your camera on your cell phone, then you will have to go through HOURS of back and forth between Panasonic and your server provider. They have to open a port to allow you to view your webpage. What good does it do me to view the camera from my house? I need to view it from my cell or remote computer. Ugh!"
4,It's Working!!!!,"The camera does what I want it to. I can monitor the house from wherever I have Internet access. Picture is good in well lit areas. I had some trouble with the install. I thought it was working and then it wasn't so I started over from the beginning. I still don't understand all the features for customized setup, but as I said before it does what I wanted it to do which is to be able to monitor my home when I'm away."
4,compatible with Mac OS X and Linux too,"The Panasonic BL-C1A camera is compatible with Firefox running on Ubuntu and Safari running on Mac OS X. ZoneMinder has native support for it. I got a camera with firmware version 1.40, which is more recent than currently posted on the Panasonic web site.These Panasonic network cameras don't use DHCP by default, which makes initial setup on a non-Windows platform difficult. The trick is that the camera will try to claim the highest address on the local block and then retry downwards.For example, if your local network is 192.168.1.0/24, then the Panasonic BL-C1A will try to use 192.168.1.254 first, and then 192.168.1.253 second, and then 192.168.1.252 third, etc. You can enable DHCP during initial setup."
3,Power supplies die too easily,"The camera is a good camera for the money, and I own three of these, and a couple Axis cameras ( seeAxis 0199024 206 Surveillance Cameras Bundle) which are way better, but three times the price. The Panasonic is good bang for the buck, especially if the lighting is decent.However, of the 3 cameras I own, two of the first ones I bought have already had their PQLV206 power supplies die. :-( Although to be fair: I've had power supply failures with the Axis cameras too; although Axis had great support and replaced them all with an upgraded version for free even after the cameras were out of warranty."
3,"Day good, Night So So...","I picked this up new but clearance at office depot for $24, plugged into my router, setup the software, enabled upnp as directed but still get failure messages when trying to view thru the web, customer service is clueless, no email response either.The recording feature works and I can view the cam (just not remotely thru the net yet) daytime shots are pretty decent, the zoom pixels things up but overall gives a nice front parking area view of my home. Night time is well, so so, you can see but its pretty grainy even zoomed out to full picture.Certainly worth the $24 I paid, have gone thru the books and searched google still cant get that upnp error to go away (and i do have upnp enabled on router).If you need this for a place that has lighting go for it, check office depots too since i scored this one for $24 recently there.Bill :)"
2,not my type,"i bought this CD hoping it would be more electronic club music but thats not at all what it was, its more jazzy/blues than electronica - i am a big fan of Ultra's Dance and Trance seriesi had one of my co-workers listen to it and he more likes the genre and he said it was decent which is why i gave it a 2 star so if you like the old club genre i guess its ok"
5,incredible,this series is amazing. so glad to see a channel dedicated the money to creating the beautiful and fascinating visual simulations and explanations of the bizarre universe we live in.
1,Deeply dissapointed. No 16:9 or CC.,My goodness! What were they thinking? The series is broadcast in HD (not the SD streached you see for some shows) and there's the ability to watch with closed captions.When they put this to DVD/Blu-ray they made it 1:33 (Regular TV square size) and NO closed captioned. What a slap in the face that was. I mean this is 20th century format they are using. Good grief.I'm grateful that I rented the first disc to see what it was like.I reccomend that you do not purchase this until they put out a series that's HD (16:9) and closed captions for both DVD and Blu-ray.beh
1,"Very Dumbed Down, For... Like.. Teenagers Only, dude!","Very disappointed. The set looked so promising, but the in your face flashy attitude never lets up and the dumbed down commentary is just ridiculous. I really wanted to like this, but just cant watch this stuff. You try to learn something, but end up with nothing. A supernova ""Whoa! Wouldn't want to be near that thing!"" Buy these DVDs for young school children only or better yet just by Carl Sagan Cosmos or anything by BBC."
1,A scary and perilous universe? History thinks so.,"Short on real information, the History Channel instead chose to focus on the perilous nature of the universe. The chapter on the sun, for example, features experts discussing how dangerous the sun is and the many ways the sun might kill off all life on the planet earth. What about more detailed information about what makes the sun tick.If you enjoy the thriller on the edge of your seat type of programming, this is good. If you are looking for something more educational or scientific about our amazing universe, this is NOT the DVD."
1,NOT Widescreen!?!,"I've been looking forward to watching this series on DVD. However, I get it home to find out that it's a widescreen show presented letterboxed in a 1.33:1 format rather than as 16:9 anamorphic. So I either have to watch it vertically compressed or in a little box with black all around it. If you know what I'm talking about this will annoy you to no end. If you don't, you probably won't care. But in the age of widescreen HDTVs, there's just no excuse for this kind of shoddy DVD production anymore. I know that the History Channel ran this on their HD channel, so they could've easily made the DVDs anamorphic widescreen. Ridiculous. I feel ripped off."
3,Way too dramatic,"Well, it is way too dramatic for the purpose. Yes, educational value, no doubt, is present. But there could a nicer way of telling the story. The music is like from armageddon movie or something and everything is building up intense. Yes, agreed, the forces out there are way too powerful for our little planet with all the living humans to comprehend, but isn't there an optimistic side to all of that sciense ? Compare this series to any series BBC produces and you will find their productions much better. I can not recommend it to kids - there are better educational programs out there on the topic. Also it is too ""flashy"" - short bursts of shots, music and changing scenery on the screen. It is ok, not good, not bad - just ok.--V."
3,"Affirmative Action, I see","Good coverage of mainstream scientific facts and theories. Graphics are superb. But, are the only people in the sciences women, blacks and asians? Virtually all of the scientists shown were women -- with a sprinkling of black men and some asians, too. I think I saw one white man and then, of course, the narration was by a man. So, some slip through, I see.Don't you see that when people who produce videos are SO politically correct that we have to have doubts about the rest of the production's integrity....National Geographic and the History channel are becoming nauseating in their heavy handed introduction of politics into everything they touch.Grow up."
3,"Great, except it's letterboxed.","Fantastic series, but if you have an HDTV, like many of us do now, your in for a disappointment. This set is presented in a letterboxed format which means on an HDTV, there are going to be thick black bars framing the image, not just that the top and bottom of the screen, but all the way around. I don't know what the distributer is thinking, this should have been presented in a widescreen 16:9 aspect ratio. I hope they correct this on season two."
4,"Beautiful images, relaxing education!","Wonderful series! I purchased this DVD series for my boyfriend for Christmas. He has loved astronomy since he was a kid and so do I, so I was most excited to watch the series with him. It won't disappoint, full of beautiful images and very realistic computer graphics. The only drawback, and possibly a feature to some, is that the science is broken down so it is easily comprehended by most anyone. It would be a perfect educational tool for those with little physics or astronomy exposure and great for middle-high school children. But even if you do have a strong knowledge of space, just watch it for the pretty pictures."
4,One of my favs,"I started watching this by accident one day on the history channel and immediately got hooked. It is extremely interesting to learn about space and other worlds. Of course many of the things talked about can't really be proven yet, but it is still very interesting. Very well done and it makes learning fun. Why wasn't there anything like this when I was younger?"
2,It's Not That Great,"I would have to agree with the reviewer who wrote that there is too much whiz-bang stuff in this series. With all the comments about the quality of the graphics, I was disappointed with the video as it was projected on my home theater screen. Maybe it's terrific on a smaller screen, but I was looking for the airsick bag on several of the episodes. There's also a tendency for the editors to repeat the same graphics material way too many times to illustrate a point. It was starting to look like the nightly news where they use the same footage over and over again becuase there wasn't enough material for the editors to work with. Overall, it's just not that great."
2,The Universe - The Complete Season One,Wanted to Know Before Purchasing Product: On the Amazon Web site it says that the audio is English and Spanish. I have received the video and there is no Spanish Audio. Otherwise the series is spectacular.
3,Not too much HD,Good documentary series but I miss subtitles (english and spanish) and I miss more High Definition resolution. DVD edition may be enough. No need for more expensive Blu-Ray edition.
4,No Dolby or DTS sound!,"I rented this. Even though the picture comes across as 1080p/24, the sound is standard. That was disappointing. I really like BR because of its pic AND hi-def audio."
5,Everyone should own this blu-ray,"This blu-ray not only has incredible CGI but also contains great information about our universe. Being a fan of cosmotology, I have to give great props to this artwork."
4,"Awesome Show, a little pricey","For those of you who haven't seen the Universe on the History Channel, let me explain. It's a very in-depth, but not over your head description of theoretical and astronomical physics. The cast of regular scientists aren't just informative, but actually entertaining. You can tell this stuff genuinely excites them. The graphics sometimes are pretty wild too.Unfortunately, this being the first season, they stick to pretty standard space topics such as ""The Moon"" and ""Jupiter"". Later seasons include more lofty topics like Dark Matter and Faster Than Light Travel.If you can find this on sale (I found it under half price), then this is a must both for entertainment and something to showcase your Blu-Ray's capabilities. Just having this on your shelf will make you look smarter."
4,Best cost x benefit,"A must-have for astronomy fans, although the 1080i resolution is not what we expect for a series like this."
3,Nothing new here.,"The video wasn't as good as it should be, the info was good except for the constant implication of universal doom."
2,"Should have been called ""The Universe for Dummies""","There are some interesting presentations in this series, and some stunning visuals. That's the only upside. The downside is, it was written assuming the audience are idiots - it's so 'dumbed down' that it's of very little information value - and there are plenty of factual inaccuracies that had me shouting at the screen.If you already have even a basic understanding of the universe, watch this ONLY for the visuals, because you certainly won't learn anything from this series."
3,no audio in spanish or subtitle,This picture dont have audio in spanish. Dont buy it.Yo la compre por equivocacion.
2,Una edición no muy buena,"El DVD viene en formato 4:3 y no 16:9 como están grabados los programas, la calidad no es tan buena como se esperaba.El pack si bien dice en Amazon que tiene subtitulos en español no trae nada ni siquiera CC para inglés."
2,Simple Series,"Why is the DVD version in Full Screen 1.33:1 format and Blu-Ray is in Widescreen 1.85:1? It appears that this is a new way to force DVD obsolescence and move everyone to Blu-Ray. That really annoys me.As for the series, it is very elementary, although enjoyable to watch. I would prefer more animation and less interview and real-world examples as this is really aimed at the simple minded."
5,Out of This World!,"I've ordered this show on iTunes and now I want to add this as a permanent collection on my DVD rack, so here I am. This show is great on a number of levels. Following along the lines of great shows like Dogfights, this series takes a new, refreshing, and bold look at our solar system, stars, galaxies, you name it, with great computer graphics and special effects. I've longed for a show that realistically took me among the clouds of Jupiter and Saturn, and here it is. It's also great for the family, because even though its focus is on science its presentation is on a layman's -- or even children's -- level. My 8-year-old daughter has even shown a newfound interest in astronomy. So consider buying this show; not just for you, but for the entertainment and enlightenment of those around you. You won't regret it. To the creators of this show, if you read this, know your work is greatly appreciated and keep 'em coming!"
5,For those who continue to question...,"The episode on the Big Bang is worth the price just by itself. For anyone who ever wanted to know how ""we"" know what we know about the Big Bang, this contains one episode solely focused on that aspect. Yes, I too had learned most of this in grade school, but there are some who are not as fortunate (or need a refresher). Neil DeGrasse Tyson's quote at the end of that episode is priceless..."
2,A true disappointment.,"Do not purchase this DVD. It doesn't even have the March on WAshington speech in its entirety. I thought that it would be equal in quality to the ""Montgomery to Memphis"" documentary of which I have an old copy. It wasn't even remotely close. So take my advice. Pass on this purchase and hope that some day there will be a DVD version of the original ""Montgomery to Memphis"" video."
2,Keep searching!,"Well I purchased this video believing that I would get a better perspective on Dr. King's speeches, but I was somewhat disappointed. First, this tape is recorded in EP/LP (long play) speed. Therefore it is easily visible to notice the inferior quality of the recording. The documentary is only a hour long, there shouldn't of been a reason to apply it in long play mode. I was appreciative of the time spent on his second triumph-the war on povery and his staunch opposition to the Vietnam War. But when the video gets near the end and ventures on the Memphis sanitation workers strike in March/April 1968. You see footage from his 1966 Chicago equal housing campaign.The bottom line is that I wouldn't recomend this video. Oh yah, Martin was born with the name of Michael Luther King jr."
5,PART OF HISTORY,"I WOULD RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYBODY THIS PART OF OUR CULTURE AND HISTORY, TO KNOW WHAT STRUGLE THE PEOPLE INDURED AND WENT THROUGH IN ORDER FOR US TODAY TO LIVE THE LIFE OF WHAT WE LIVE TODAY"
5,Talent with such enthusiasm as this is rare and wonderful.,"Talent with such entusiasm as this is rare and wonderful. Diverse, contemporary sound rich in individual style and built on the great jazz tradition of exploration and expression."
3,This one is so-so...,"I am surprised to see this song has not made it to the U.S. yet. I heard it all through out my trip to Germany. I was shocked that when I left for my trip I had never heard it and then when I got back about three weeks later NO ONE here had heard of it either. It's really popular in Europe and I'm sure if they get wind of it here, it will be played every other song too."
2,I don't know about this book,"Yeah, this book was very educational and historically accurate but I found myself frequently bored. This book took me a long time to read and it was under 200 pages. It was very hard to get into. Thank you."
4,A Wonderful Holacost Book!,"This book is a lot like Carol Matas' other book, Daniel's Story! The only difference is that this story is about a girl who is a teenager, a Jew, and is trying to grow up during WWII! It shows what teenagers went through in WWII and how they handled things! It really is a great read!"
5,Phenomenal book.,"Phenomenal book, would recommend to absolutely anyone. Carol Matas is an exceptional author who creates beautiful scenes and situations with just her words. It is a story I won't forget and will definitely be rereading time and time again. Awesome."
4,a girls courage to survive.,"This book is about a girl that is sent to a concentration camp in Germony with her mother, grandmother, and her aunt. Anna is 13yrs old. She tries to make life good while at this camp. She treams of plays and all kinds of things. Along the way she makes new friends and starts to have a real good relationship with her bestfriends brother. His name is Rudie and Anna starts to help him deliver fake papers to people in danger. So I think everyone sould read this book to see if she gets out or not"
1,Hub had bad bearings ( brand new),"When recieved this unit would not rotate smoothly, it had an out of round bearing. Unit was returned for refund.I was actually surprised to see this poor level of quality control out of a good company--"
4,"WAS SCARY,I LIKED IT ALOT!!!","I liked this movie a lot...I Bought this DVD somewhere else, almost under $10.00,always shop around in internet world to buy any DVDS for my collection!. I liked it a lot, have a old fashion style like in back in late 70s & 80s movies..Is kind of started slow, but almost in middle of the movie picked up the scare and chills. Made me jumped in some few senses, Have a great scary soundtrack. . Was scary and kind of gory! DVD was in great packing & looks, real good sharp pic and audio, put it that way if u like Halloween or Friday13th, You would like this movie! Worth to buy or rent... is your choice! I bought this DVD and I am glad I did. I enjoy it. Can't wait to see this director comes out with another scary horror movie. I definitely look for him! A"
1,This Film Is Why Horror Is Dead,"In this movie, the bank robbers and their hostages(FROM DUSK TIL DAWN) find an old slaughterhouse (TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) where the killer (TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN/FRIDAY THE 13TH pt2) imitates scenes from (HALLOWEEN)......This whole thing stunk. Funny thing is though, watch the featurette to the director praise himself on every detail of the movie you found either really annoying or just plain awful.I know we the horror genre audience owe a great debt to Anchor Bay Entertainment, but you have to keep it honest, and honestly these reviews are giving this film too much credit.Go ahead and rent it, you'll regret you did, then turn to your friend and say, ""it wasnt that bad"" but you know it was."
4,Not bad at all,"I saw this movie and there were quiet a few scarey parts that I didn't know what would happen. I found it very interesting and it held my attentiion until the last minute of the movie. If you are into a psychological horror, not necessarily a gore movie, try this one."
3,The Halloween Chainsaw Massacre The 13th !,"As a big fan of the classic slasher films of the 70's & 80's its always nice to see a Director who is not afraid to be called a ripp-off artist & who knows that when somthing isn't broken there is no need to fix it. This is a good horror film made by a real horror fan & i enjoyed it very much! 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' & 'Halloween' are blue prints on how to make a good scary horror movie,so MALEVOLENCE Director Stevan Mena used the blue prints & made a good scary horror movie with a couple of corney dry spots."
5,A tribute to a lsot era,I can't understand why this movie is getting bashed it isn't supposed to be original but rather to pay homage to the great flicks of the 70's and 80's you know back when horror was more visceral and gritty and not softcore pussy assed weak marketable PG-13 BS. I must say this is what a horror movie should be real composed music as opposed ot top forty crap. A classic that the whole world will probally never know because of standards of Hollywood.
1,A new high in low.,"This movie is bad,really bad.Bad directing,bad acting,bad writing,bad pacing,bad cinimatography,bad lighting.Bad enough to ruin a life.A plague of badness on a Biblical scale.Well maybe not that bad,but lord knows it wasn't good.Run away from this movie as if your very soul depended on it.I think it just might."
2,not good,"This was a big disappointment. Three uninteresting characters rob a bank, take two boring hostages, and end up being pursued by the lamest killer in the history of horror movies. This wussy Jason rip off gets kicked in the nuts by a twelve year old girl on several occasions. Not scary, not bloody, not funny, no nudity, no jokes.A shame, really, because I like the premise. (criminals stalked by a psychopath)"
2,"Great Concept,but poor execution.","Malevolence is a horror movie that tells the tale of a deranged lunatic that tortures and kills women. The story touches on Martin Bristol a six year old boy that was kidnapped over ten years ago and became the student of this psychotic killer. The story has another plot going as well about four people that have committed a bank robbery and are on the run. One of the robbers in an attempt to get away car jacks a women and her young daughter and takes them to an abandoned house where he waits for the other bank robbers to arrive. The story gets really creepy and confusing and you just want it to end. I just discovered Anchor Bay Films and I'm quickly becoming a fan, but this one just didn't do it for me. The prequel to this movie ""Bereavement"" is a much better movie, but it still lacks the gripping conclusions that I love in a good horror film, but the storylines are much more cohesive than Malevolence."
2,i guess it gets old after a bit...,Maybe we have seen too many horror movies but we found the film to be rather boring and in some parts slow. There are quite a few parts where the characters are running through dark woods even before they are stalked by the killer. The mother remains bound throughout most of the movie and once the little girl flees the viewer doesn't see her for a while. The killer's face is covered the vast majority of the time. Plus the very ending was predictable. The movie (like most of the reviewers have mentioned) is a rehash of other horror movies so there is not anything new or extremely well done.
2,Malevolence......,"I don't quite see the connection to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Friday The 13th in this movie!It by no means comes close. A young boy, Martin, is taken from his home at an early age by a psycho. Jump to 10 years later when Martin is now a disturbed soul after what he suffered at the hands of the psycho. We then see a group of bank robbers who are now seeking refuge. They end up taking a mother and daughter as hostages going to an abandoned home. We find what seemed to be an abandoned plant not so abandoned for a madman is living there. Plot is boring at times and the acting is not too good. This is an easily forgettable movie. Not good as I expected it to be.Rent it if you are curious but I wouldn't suggest buying this film."
4,Jardins,"A very nice fragrance with a hint of elegant subtlety, and ready for evening out for dinner or to a special event."
5,Return of a classic,"What a pleasure to see this classic returned to print. Mr. Mitchell had a wonderful ear in his time, and now almost fifty years later, the tone is still strong, and the places that he told us of are mostly gone. Thankfully, McSorley's is still with us, but the Beefsteak Party (The Second best of the stories) and the theater on Park Row are long gone, as is the Third Avenue El. No one rides that anymore in the summer to cool off. There is a reason why this was voted one of the top 100 pieces of American Journalism in the 20th century by New York University's journalism department. (it placed 84th)Buy it to read the bit on McSorley's, ""The Old House at Home,"" and buy it to read ""All You can Hold for Five Bucks,"" buy it to read one wonderful story at a time. Its good to see it back."
2,Used book purchase,An e-mail was sent from the buyer within an hour and a message also sent when mailed along with a tracking # All went very smoothly and would highly reccommend the seller. Sincerly Joel Olson
1,Unreadable,"Brian Swann, Another Story (Adler, 1984)The only thing that saved this from a dustbunny feast is it 114-page length. I felt guilty about burning something that would produce so little heat.Another Story is disjointed, ungainly, gratuitous, and generally unreadable. Think James Joyce, but without plot, theme, or character development. I'd tell you what it's about, if I had been able to discern such. Instead, I'll just tell you to avoid it like the plague. *"
3,Good overview,I would recommend this book to read if you plan on using a respirator in your shop and want to give yourself some background information on safe use. Choose this book because it looked helpful and easy to read.
3,"Bonnie Langford dazzles on budget-priced ""Oliver!"" disc","Of all the musical theatre roles in Bonnie Langford's resume, the one you assume she has definitely played at some point in the past - that of Nancy in OLIVER! - isn't there. It's a good thing then, that this album (originally part of Pickwick's ""Shows Collection"" series in 1993-94) is back in print, fulfilling, in audio form at least, the fantasy of having Langford in a role she's still absolutely perfect for.As you would expect, Langford brings you to the verge of chills, with a commanding ""As Long as He Needs Me""; similarly, you are in safe hands when she leads the chorus in ""It's a Fine Life"" and ""Oom-Pah-Pah"". Veteran theatre actor Victor Spinetti is a very solid Fagin; boy soprano Gareth Stringer is a tad too ""nasal"" in the title role, but does a nice job nevertheless.A fine title for your collection."
5,Love It!,"We love this game. I always loved Memory as a child, and am so glad to have found such an appealing version... most of the ponies are so pretty!There are lots and lots of cards, so what we do is each pick several pairs of our favorites. So we start with a sort of ""matching"" game, both the 2 yr old and 6 yr old enjoy it. Then we lay out the game (way less than the total # of cards) and have fun trying to get our ""own"" cards (the ones we picked), our favorites. When we don't, it's a great lesson in sportsmanship. This method eliminates any problems with similar looking ponies, though I agree maybe it's almost a good thing to have to pay close attention to detail. Besides, most kids could probably name each pony on sight, regardless how similar they look to each other! It's an unfair advantage for the children! :)"
2,Don't Head for the Hills,"A former English schoolteacher takes up residence in a remote, backwater community in the Hebrides. It was funny in many parts, (I especially enjoyed her first fishing experience), but as the story progressed, she never really revealed any charm in the inhabitants of the neighborhood. I kept expecting a gradual understanding and respect for these people, but it never came. She rarely described anything laudable about the inhabitants, although she found plenty to poke fun at: dishonesty, drunkenness, obstinacy, ingnorance, slovenliness, insincerity, unhealthy diet, loose morals, lack of sanitation and personal hygiene, etc. I fail to see why she stayed. Guess the rent was cheap."
5,Wonderful.,"I was privileged to meet the DeCamps in the very early 1990's. This book perfectly evokes Mr. DeCamp's wonderful, wry authorial voice."
4,sounds good to me too,"I play ""I keep it to myself""so much.Shelby Flint has such a beautiful voice.I wish that she had vocals on all Gregg`s Cds.This Cd is in my favorites catagory."
4,Sounds good to me!!!,"I bought this CD for one song, (as usual) so I was not disappointed when the other songs were so...... underwhelmingI enjoyed listening to Shelby Flint sing ""I Keep To Myself."" That did it for me. The four stars I awarded were solely for that song."
4,La mejor coleccion de La Mano,"Recopilacion imperdible, sobre todo para coleccionistas. La etapa mas latina de la Mano, un recorrido por todos los barrios bajos de nuestra sudamerica. Lo tipos le ense;aron el rock latino a los musicos de latinoamerica. La historia cambio a partir de AMERICA perdida"
2,the compass went brown,"Really liked the watch with the slide out compass. Well, until the liquid in the compass went all brown and cloudy. No watchmaker will touch it to fix so it sits in a drawer!"
2,Looks nice,"It is a nice looking watch...if you don't want a working compass. ordered one, got it and compass doesn't move! Returned and ordred the other Wenger/compass watch.....SAME PROBLEM! I'm givingup! Good news, no problems returning items. Amazon's policy is great!"
3,"good, but slightly misrepresented","I think this is a quality watch, but I'm disappointed because I wanted a rotating bezel first and foremost. The specs for this watch said ""bidirectional"" bezel, which I figured meant it could rotate in either direction. Well I have no idea what they really meant, but the bezel on this watch is most decidedly fixed in place. The compass is touchy, but it works as well as I expected. Quality of everything else seems good. Very attractive. I'd give it a higher rating if I didn't feel misled by the product page."
1,Disappointment on product.,I ordered this watch because wegner is usualy a good product and compass was a cool attachement. I get the watch and it is cool except the compass has a scratch. Not supposed to have this if new. I set the watch but it doesnt run. I send it back for a replacement. Get the replacement no scrath but still doesnt run. I take to a jewler and he opens the watch to find no battery. So I decide to buy the battery (silly me to think it would be included since the add didnt mention no battery.. After three new batteries the watch still doesnt run. I send back for full refund. Now their returns is excellent. no hassle first class treatment all the way.
4,A Good General Book,"Certain foods have always had the reputation of being good for us and there are some that heal. This book is about foods that prevent or ease ailments from arthritis and high blood pressure to allergies and diabetes, to angina and even cancer.A good book to start with, when learning about nutrition."
4,"A great follow up to ""Full Collapse""","The boys from New Jersey are at it again with this great follow-up to the equally wonderful ""Full Collapse"". This disc expands on where their previous efforts left off. The guitars sound more dynamic, the vocals pack more punch, and the rhythm section couldn't be tighter. The one thing that i've read in past reviews on Thursday that leaves a bad taste in my mouth are all the comparisions to ""Morrissey fronting Fugazi"" or ""vocals that are comparable to Ben Folds""....Huh ? Where is all of this coming from ?? I think that people need to quit with all the lame comparisons and just appreciate Thursday for what they are.. a great young band that will continue to grow musically with each record. Tracks to check out are "" Signals Over The Air"", ""Asleep In The Chapel"" and ""Tomorrow I'll Be You"""
3,Thursday- Dont you find it repetative?,"Thursday is one of my favorite band's and I hate to put them down i love all the songs off thier old album which i gave a 5/5 but it seems that on this album every song sounds the same though i do like signals over the air. I like thier old stuff like Paris In Flames, Understanding in a car crash and stuff. Well thats just my opinion."
5,This Is Pretty F-in Sweet!!,"THIS IS A 4.5 STAR REVIEWThe only reason I give this 4.5 stars is because it is not as good as Full Collapse. Thursday is very easily my favorite band. This is by far one the most lyrically acommplished bands to ever have been placed on the earth. This album is full of good songs, but there just isn't as much intensity on this album. Although I definately don't see anything wrong with a band changing it up, Full Collapse just sat with me a little better. Great songs on this album are: ""For the Work Force Drowning"", ""Division Street"", ""Marches and Manuvers"",""Steps Ascending"", and ""Tomorrow I'll Be You"". Anyone who wants to listen to some amazing music must pick up everything that Thursday has done.I am EAGERLY awaiting the next release"
4,Not quite as good as Full Collapse but still excellent,"Although War All The Time isn't quite as good as Full Collapse, it's still lightyears ahead of most bands in the genre. The one thing that War All The Time has going for it is superior mixing. Geoff's vocals sounded a bit weak on Full Collapse and Waiting, but were much better on the live ep. On War All The Time I feel that they are at the right level, not overpowering the guitars, but not sounding weak and distant. Infact they are a lot more representative of what Thursday sound like live."
4,amazing,What a great band this is. I can't wait to catch them live now that I've heard this disc. They kind of remind me of a fusion of the Deftones and Tool and some other bands. Their is amazing musicianship on this cd and some incredible lyrics. My only downpoint is that every once in a while they singer annoys me a little bit. Just a little. He's an excellent lyricist though and definetely know what he's doing. I'm sure that we'll see a lot from this band in the years to come.
1,Music to cut yourself to. Emo must die.,This is gonna be brief. Lets see what have here. Off key whiny singer. Check. Crappy lyrics. Check. Pathetic attempts at songwriting. Check. Blatant disregard for quality musical composition. Check. Ohh wait it's an emo band. Should have known that in the first place. This album blows. Spend your mommy's money on something better than this. Please you'll be doing society a favor.
2,why not Tuesday?,It's just the same as the last album. Nothing left to say. Just read my review on Full Collapse by Thursday. Here's a sample of the music on this album..........AAAAhhhhhhhhhhhhhh...waaa waaaaa waa ahhhgghhhhh ...just ahhhhhh hgghhhha... yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy ....aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
3,What happened to Thursday?,"I bought all three of their albums at the same time. I listened to them from oldest to newest.Waiting was a good CD, but it's very obvious they were on an amatuer label..Their sophomore attempt, Full Collapse [On Impact], is BRILLIANT! Every song is amazing.But this third release feels very forced. It seems like they just wanted to put another album out there to make money and get their name out.A lot of people will disagree with me, but my opinion stands."
1,one long continuous boring track,"listen, i truly loved full collapse. I thought it was an original and inventive second, breakout record. So I was expecting more from the followup. This is the type of record that you listen to all the way through and when its over say to yourself, ""What? It's over? That's it? What happened?"" There's no impact on this record. Nothing stands out. Its bland dissapointment and annoying that so many people love it because they feel obligated to."
3,Not as good as the rest,"This Cd was a lot worse then Full Collapse and Waiting. Between Rupture and Rapture is acctually painful for me to listen to, that intro is terrible. Division St and Tomorrow I'll Be You are good songs but the rest are not what i had expected for thursday."
2,:-/,"Big, huge let down after the first full length. ""War All the Time"" has been hyped to oblivion because it needs the hype. It won't sell on its own like ""Full Collapse"" did in the beginning.Still, part of me thinks that the albums aren't so different and that the novelty of this band has just worn out.The arrangements are stale, the instruments are stale, the vocals and lyrics are REALLY, REALLY stale. I don't know, everything just seems dull about this album.Do yourself a favor and listen it to it before you buy it. Just make sure its something that you like on its own, not just because you liked the first record.I bought this and sold it back to the store as a used CD three or four weeks later."
4,im impressed,"Ill admit it, first off i hated this band cuz of their sorry emo crap, but being a drummer and guitarist, i actaully listened to what all the commotion was about around thursday. I listened to the album and the 1st song i heard was War all the time, and that song gave me the chills, that song was brilliant, i just wish they would retain that state of brilliance throughout the album, every other song is ok, some good some bad, but hey they got my attention"
5,my opinion,"to get the subject of what music this is/i like out of the way, heres a short list of my favorite bands: poison the well, remembering never, cradle of filth, blood has been shed, underoath, as i lay dying.now you know what i listen to, it's obviously not stuff liek this usually, so now you can decide if you're going to listen to me or not.i hated this cd at first, i couldnt listen to it. one day i finally saw the video for 'war all the time'. i thought the song was really amazing and i went back and listened to a few others, namely for the workforce drowning and this song is brought to you by a falling bomb. my opinion of this album changed, and now i love it. this album has huge depth, you just have to give it a while to hit you. at first the guy's voice sounds whiny and annoying, but theres somethign to it thats different than anything ive ever heard."
2,Yawn,"Okay, this album is NOT awesome, it is NOT spectacular. It is all in all, a disappointment. Usually a band will progress as it puts out CD's, hopefully each one getting better. Unfortunately, Thursday took a step or two backwards. The cd is just BLAH. Its got a few catchy little riffs, but in general, it has no dynamics. No powerful chorus like in FULL COLLAPSE, and not near enough screaming. If you like it, good. I love Thursday, at least there last album, but they gotta do better."
5,Falling Down to Greatness,"I started writing this review many a time. But I've realized that no review i write can convey the emotion I am feeling with regards to this records. All I can say is, that it is absotively brilliant. From start to stop there is not one horrible song. One song is done completely to a piano and I like that song as much as the others and I listen mostly to hardcore music. Obviously this rewiew falls short of conveying the emotion I am feeling. All I can say is that I rarely find an album in which every song is worth hearing. This record is good. If you liked their other stuff, you'd like this probably more but it can appeal to anyone, your hardcore kid or your screamo kid, or your indie emo kid. One of the best of 2003!!"
5,Brilliant,"After buying War All The Time, I now know what music is supposed to sound like... Original lyrics, Amazing vocal & guitar performances... yeah its all here.Like everyone else here, I could now write about how thursday kicks some other bands ass.... But unless you can create something better than the band your trashing... Shut the F*ck up..."
4,going downhill,"This record is still pretty good, but unlike everyone else who believes this is the best thing since sliced bread, FULL COLASPE is better. WAR ALL THE TIME seems to contain songs like the ones that were sub-par on FULL COLLASPE. Its just very average. I still give it four stars because there are a few good songs like ""This Song Is Brought To You By A Falling Bomb"" which is just a piano ballad, and the alblum title/song ""War All The Time"". Honestly, if your gonna spend money to get a cd get the new THRICE cd ""Artist in the Ambulance ""...."
1,Boring...,"I just dont know what any one seesin thursday's music...Perosnaly? I think their boring and way to repetitive. The only decent thursday album was ""waiting"" thats a good cd but their third album ""war all the time"" sounds pretty boring and i fellasleep listining to most of this songs! If you wnat good thursday get ""waiting"" but dont buy this one! Laters!"
1,Annoying. Very annoying.,"Give me an electric guitar, a distortion pedal and a member from N'Sync who is really really mad about something and there we have it....Thursday! Every song sounds the same and the singer has got serious issues with his vocals. Clean vocals over distorted guitars is such a fashion now I cannot even imagine how people stand it. ""Steve Pedulla is a talented guitarist"".....yeah right, give me a break! Fine he may be talented but why is he making such garbage??? Thursday is a disposable band. No Talent.Highlight: Helping Prozac sales."
2,this is considerably worse than full collapse,"I think I gave full collapse 4 stars, and in retrospect, I have no idea why. It deserved 3 stars, and this deserves 2 stars. Thursday's problem has always been that they are basically boring. I have trouble listening to Thursday songs all the way through, so that makes listening to Thursday albums damn near impossible. Even the best full collapse songs (cross out the eyes, how long is the night?, standing on the edge of summer, understanding in a car crash) get old before they end. There are no songs on war all the time as good as any of those songs, and the title track is the only one that comes close. For the workforce, drowning, and asleep in the chapel are the only other songs on here that are likeable for any amount of time; the rest are simply bearable."
3,it was their best work,"it was kinda in the middle to be honest, the lyrices were good but not great. The band itself is awesome!!!!! there is no reason you should not like this album."
2,I dunno what I should say. Leaves a weird taste in my mouth.,"Not really good but not bad enough for everyone to go around BSing about this OK band. There's nothing to the album and songs. Lyrics are okay but there's no melody or good beat.Good Artists and Songs:My CHemical Romance (love most of their songs) Helena and I'm not Okay are pretty good but greatly overrated.)Senses Fail (voice needs getting used to but once you do, they are great)Thrice (love about every single one of their like 50 songs)System Of A Down (download Chop Suey[the best] Toxicity, Tentative, BYOB, and Vicinity of Obsenity)And for the Okay Artists: Jack's Mannequin, THe Academy Is, Brand New, Funeral For a Friend, Panic At the Disco, From FIrst to Last, Sim 41, etc.Also, Blink 182, The Killers, and Hawthorne Heights are GREATLY overrated. They're marginal to okay bands but everybody loves them."
5,The best album ever released!!,"This is the greatest cd ever!! Every song is amazing!!! Buy this album, or you will DIIIIIIEEEEEE!!!! Just kidding, but just get it anyway!!"
5,Extremely Good.,This album is extremely good. Thursday itself is extremely good. I highly suggest buying this album.
3,Thursday-War All the Time,"When a band comes out with an album that is as strong as Thursday's ""Full Collapse,"" they often spend years trying to top it. Geoff Rickley definitely put in enough sweat and tears to produce a top notch album here but it does not quite live up to the hype. Maybe these guys thought and or tried too hard on this one. Either way this one let me down a little bit, but still managed to impress me as Thursday so often does. I don't think this band is capable of putting out a weak release and ""War All the Time,"" is no exception. There are some excellent songs with true meaning here. Not one of the year's best, but you should still give it a shot. 72/100"
5,Wow-Thursday Gets Better,"First of all, I have been a Thursday fan since Waiting and I completely disagree with the people who call this album contrived. It is a masterpiece. The lyrics are amazing. My favorite songs on the album are asleep in the chapel, for the workforce, drowning, signals over the air, and war all the time. These are some great tracks, give it a listen. Don't forget to see them live, they truly are amazing live."
5,Probably one of the best CD's I've heard,"Thursday is an awesome band and this CD was awesome.I like the sound of the lead singer as well. The first song For the Workforce Drowning is probably the second best w/ a good semi-hardcore/emo sound. But the #1 song would definatley have to be Signals Over The Air. A really good drum beat greets you at the beginning of the song as the guitar entertwines with it, then lead singer Geoff takes you into some really good lyrics. If you like the emo and semi hardcore emo sound, War All the Time would probably be the CD for you =)"
5,5 Stories Falling But Not Thursday,"Amidst all the standard brainless emo/alternative music in today's world, Thursday is the standout and the epitome of bands. Although this album has been released a year and a half ago, it still is just as impacting as the first time I listenened. The standouts: Asleep in Chapel, War All The Time, Steps Ascending, Division St. This is my all time favorite record...ever. Do not hesitate, buy this immediately, worth everything you have for this lyrically depth and artisitic masterpiece."
2,Would be better if the lead singer could actually sing,"I can't believe people actually like Thursday. After such a great song signals over the air, I bought the CD. The rest of the tracks were complete garbage, and a total waste of money."
2,Almost Decent,"Alot of reviews mention thursdays previous release ""full collapse"". i haven't heard it but i bouhgt this cd from a store going out of business for 1.50, and i kinda wish i would have went down the road to Wendy's with that money. Thursday's concept is OK,and they have some catchy parts, but the vocal melodies do not match the music. also the lyrics do not appear brilliant to me at all. they seem contrived and they singer does not do a very good job of singing them instep with the rest of the band. if you like overly pretentious lyrics, you should check out the new The Mars Volta record instead of this one."
3,This cd sucks,I was a fan of thursday for a long time before this cd came out. I was excited for its release but when it came out i have to say i was very disapointed they changed their whole style. What the hell were they thinking when they wrote Between Rupture and Rapture that song is painful for me to listen to. They used to be sweet and now they suck. This song brought by a falling bomb. Thats not thursday style at all. If you really want to hear good thursday songs check out the other two cd's at least they tried on those.
2,wow is this what they call screamo?,"thats funny ...i didnt hear any screamingi had the choice to buy this album or the red record(Loudermilk)and like an idiot i choose this crap. the only thing on this album that makes it worth listening to even once are the drums...they are decent.downs: just about everythingUps: it was kinda fun to peal the sticky things off the case right after i boght it.in conclusion:dont waste your time... buy ""Faliure On"" Beloved[us]"
4,A Favorite,"This was always one of our favorites growing up, now I buy it for friends with children. Silly and fun with just the slightest bit of a moral. I also have many of John Birmingham's other books, the Mr. Gumpy series is very entertaining."
1,Umm.no.,"Billy McLaughlin is a great guitarist, although, in my opinion, not a very accomplished singer..keep up the fretwork Billy, instrumentals are great! Unfortunately there aren't many instrumentals here in this album.."
1,Fine as long as you don't use it outdoors,"I bought this chair as a gift for my mother to use on her patio. Within 6 months the finish was rotted off the wooden arms and the metal grommets were all rusted. My folks live in Florida where it is sunny and humid, and I guess this chair can't handle either one."
4,Cute and it works!,"This is a tiny cute car, it's easy to assemble and it's fun to run.It needs direct sun to run. It's better to buy at least 2 to make a contest.Their size is about that of a HotWheel(R) car."
4,Fun and Educational,"I bought this toy for my seven year old and we built it together. At first, it didn't work and I thought it was defective. However, after some tweaking by my husband, it now works perfectly. You have to line things up perfectly or nothing happens."
1,Boring. Tiny.,"I had to help my son put this together, though the instructions are pretty easy. It's a tiny car, and I'm not sure it works. He expressed little interest in it overall."
3,Not so bad...,"I agree that the heavily stylised singing gets in the way of enjoying the music.In addition, they only included some of the 'more listenable' (ie less danceable) of Piazzolla's work, which is a bother as he's my favourite dance-music composer...In all, it has some interesting tracks, and makes an interesting addition to my car's CD stack. Not a great one though."
4,Comprehensive and balanced,"An excellent biography compared to those that precede it. First, it covers Wodehouse's entire life with almost equal interest. It doesn't just cut to the juicy bits. Second, and most importantly, it feels balanced. It gives as honest a view as possible of the most controversial aspects of the subject's life. I think this is as close as a biography of Wodehouse comes to understanding one of the funniest and prolific writers of his time."
2,There has to be something better,"There has to be a better econometrics book out there, although I assume if you're buying this you're doing so because you have to for class and not because you're out there trying to find the best book. I used this for econometrics class at USC and it was okay as a reference after lectures, but rarely made sense if tried to read it before class. Now, when I occasionally refer to it as a reference at work, I find it time hard to quickly find answers to my questions. It's poorly organized and not very straightforward. I'm sure there is better out there."
4,Just what the doctor ordered.,The manual had the information I needed to repair my Cub Cadet 1200. Straight forward with relavent information on trouble shooting and subsequent repair strategies.
5,Mohammed Unveiled.,"At last, a book that lovingly describes the life of Mohammed and his great contribution to mankind. Just excellent!"
1,not much of a tea spoon,"This spoon is not long enough to be a tea spoon, it is more like a coffee spoon."
3,It was OK.....,"While I cannot rate this as one of the best books I have read, I don't regret purchasing it at all. I found the writing a bit difficult to follow at times, however, all-in-all, I enjoyed the story. Definitely multi-layered and not lacking in twists and turns."
4,Outstanding Account,The book is an outstanding account of a typical drug ring and the circumstances used to hide proceeds etc. It is very well written and keeps the reader engrossed in a world unknown to the majority. It is a must read for anyone who wants to glean knowledge of trafficking etc.
3,Michael McDonald:Model Citizen.,"Michael McDonald(Who along with Will Sasso were one of my personal Favorites on MadTv)does a good job at stand-up in this one,despite Jabs at his own(He's Catholic just like me yet he talks about A Juggling Priest and kids)Along with The Terry Schiavo case mention and to ""Legalize"" it,along with the endorsement/shoutout to The ever Annoying And Unfunny Kathy Griffin which I all disagree with and found unfunny(Cancer another UnFunny topic),He also seemed nervous at times yet still managed to pull it off,I liked him a lot better on MadTv in most of the roles including Stuart."
1,doesnt look like picture,"the ring in the picture looked beautiful, I couldn't wait to get it. Now it has arrived and looks like a knock off version of the picture, its a very cheap CHEAPPP ring and it is discolored if I tried to explain what it looks like I'd say it looks like its on the verge of rusting/ has sun damage, I hate it. I guess you get what you pay for, but I am very disappointed that it looks nothing like the picture because that IS what I was expecting. Save your 8 bucks for something else."
4,Book Qualty and Condition,"Condition of book was like new,and Donnie Brasco ""Unfinished Business"" was better than it's predecessor because convictions were made and upheld allowing for better ""script"". In my mind author and retired F.B.I. agent Joseph D. Pistone is an American hero for his talent as undercover agent,and his unshakeable nerve to operate in that criminal environment.The reading of this book is both informative, and entertaining."
2,Donnie Brasco,I read his fist book and this one added very little to the first. It told me alot of stuff that I read in another book about Joey Massino being the last Don. If you read Joe Pistones first book then skip this one.
2,Just a Little Too Much,"There is very little in ""Unfinished Business"" that has not been covered before. Also, UB lacks the freshness, the bold impact that ""Donnie Brasco"" caused when first published. That was a classic. This is an easy one to pass by. The DB story may have stayed too long at the dance."
3,Short,"I loved the original Donnie Brasco book as well as the movie. There were a few questions left unanswered in the first book, and a few things about the changes in the movie from the book that I was interested about. This book written twenty years later does answer those questions. The problem with this book is that it has too little information that I wanted and way too much filler. Part of the book covers his experiences in Hollywood, while another part at the end talks about various cases involving the Mafia that can only tenuously be linked to the Donnie Brasco affair. Most of the cases talked about have been covered in much greater detail in other books. The parts that I wanted to know about were interesting. I just wish he had rereleased a revised Donnie Brasco with an extra chapter or two added to the end to summarize the outcome of certain situations that couldn't be written about the first time around."
2,Too little new information added after the first book + The writing style is not interesting.,"- I agree with 2 other reviewers that there is too little new information added after the first book by the same author.- In my opinion, the writing style is not interesting. I'm glad I read it in the library instead of buying it."
2,"A clear rehash, and not a very tasty one at that...","If you've already read ""Donnie Brasco"", there's really nothing here that you need. Pistone rehashes some of his time undercover, and then goes on to re-report the same mob news that's been reported over and over for the past decade. Really, there's nothing here to justify the cost. No new photos, very little new information of interest, save Pistone's opinion on more modern mobsters and a few undercover snippets from his other later operations. His clear opinion that the Commission Case led to the dismantling of the modern American Mafia is a bit overstated, as well, being mentioned continually during his ruminations on the state of the modern mob. Overall, you can miss this one, without actually missing all that much."
2,Case is a Disappointment,"I had ordered a Covertec case for my Sony PDA a few years ago and was pleased with their quality and attention to detail. After looking around, I thought I would splurge and get a similar case for my BB - unfortunately, I'm not impressed.The design of the case is poor - there is no sleeper switch, therefore the keyboard needs to be locked when the case is closed. Secondly, there is no opening for the speaker on the back, so the ring is severely muffled. I put some business cards in the sleeve of the case and now it is unbalanced, flipping upside down when the phone is not there. All in all, quite disappointing.The quality of the leather and stitching is very good - it just does not make up for a poor design. I contacted Covertec to explain my problem - no response. The icing on the cake."
1,not interessting,"I just could not get into this book. I have a mom and I am a mom, but I deleted it off my kindle."
1,Not worth it,This book is not very good. Buy something else. There's a reason it's less than a dollar. I wouldn't suggest that you can really learn to play drums - perhaps drumming on your belly.
4,This stuff is f'n good,This stuff is really f'n good. The only downside of this is the digusting intestine tube package. One of the upsides of synthetic animal chunks is that you don't have to package them in synthetic animal pieces. I would buy this a lot more often if it came in a little tub.
5,Excellent Analysis on the Eastern Warfighter,"As with all of Poole's works, we are treated here to an excellent analysis of the tactical sphere of war. This time, from the eastern fighter's perspective. Written, I believe, pre-9/11, the work itself is a thorough offering of actual techniques and wartime practices used by small units against western forces, but it is most remarkable in that it outlines in a concise and friendly manner what most analysts still fumble over on MSNBC.In the world of tactical operations and small unit tactics, we can not ask for a better teacher than John Poole. Keep a close eye out for any and all of his works, for they have a lot to say about how and what western forces will fight for the next fifty years.NOTE: This work makes a perfect companion to the author's ""The Tiger Way,"" which outlines the ideal western method for combating such tactics."
4,Long Lasting Sturdy Watch Strap,"I had a similar strap for my Casio Work Out watch & it lasted a number of years. I had no trouble installing this replacement strap. I like a wide band for this particular watch. However, it is wider than I thought it would be-- about 7/8 inch at its widest point."
1,Did not fit.,"Bought this for my dad, but it didn't fit his Illuminator watch. Not worth the hassle of sending back, just wasted money."
4,STRUGGLES A LATINO BOY FACES,"I thought this book of numerous documents of fiction was entertaining to read. Short story after short story each being totally different leaving the reader to wonder what this book is about. The main character which is a young boy all the stories which he went through together in the last story. Each individual story looks into many different issues that this young male latino faces like prejudices as an example and through his characters words the author, Thomas Rivera, infers an actual point that he is trying to get across. I would recommend this book to any person who is interested in a moving story of struggles a young latino faces which was interested from the original story written in Spanish called ""... Y no se lo trago la tierra""."
3,Not bad but not great,"It's basically the e.s.t. training in a book and has some good points to think about. But I don't buy into the you are God and you created your parents crap, gimmie a break! A much better book is ""A New Earth, Awakening to your life's purpose"" by Echart Tolle. He's much more sensible and gives lots of better information about changing your life by observing how your mind works. In fact, his first book: ""The power of Now"" was a bestseller but I recommend ""A New Earth to be read first since it's easier to comperhend."
1,"This book is literally a fraud, it's not about est.","This book is not about est. It is a fraud, and Mr. Frederick is a thief. It contains a recently and poorly written forward that mentions est - otherwise it is not mentioned in the book. This is fraud and theft. So much for enlightenment. Don't misunderstand, it's not that it's a critical book about est, it isn't about it at all. Shame on Mr. Frederick and anyone associated with this. They are theives. I will be asking Amazon for my money back. The reference in the title is to get those legitimately looking to explore something about est to order it - and be ripped off."
3,The Landmark Forum in a Book,"I am currently reading this book and find it filled with amazing concepts that are taught at the Landmark Forum. If you don't want to go to the Forum, get this book and learn the very same principles you will be learning there. Whether you actually change from this book or not is up to you, but the potential is there!If I praised it so highly, why am I giving it only 3 stars? Well, one simple reason: The book is extremely poorly edited with very obvious mistakes. If you can go beyond that, and you want to understand The Forum, this is the book for you."
3,may be helpful to some,"basically the book tells you to snap out of it, and live consciously. it tells you to think clearly before making any decision, so you realize it is you who made the decsion. after that the author gets a little loony, and starts saying that we are all gods, and that because we want to experience everything, we turned ourselves into conscious human beings. Highly self-help, metaphysical book. worth a look."
5,Wonderful Book,Really good book. The metaphysics of EST are as true today as they ever were. Being at Source? Showing Gratitude and Appreciation? Understand Cause and Effect? You are not a body? You are connected with everything? All great questions covered in est Playing the Game.
3,Can She Keep Her Secret?,"This story shares the trials of young Marisa, a Jewish girl, during World War II. Orphaned, Marisa chose to hide her true identity and go to work for the German enemy to save her own life. Keeping her secret proved to be impossible. Read this interesting story to find out why."
4,Awesome!!!!!!,Carol Matas came to my school and we were rewquired to read all of her books. This one was magnificant!!! I recommend it!!
3,only 1 bad word...high praise indeed !,"This is a good story. I felt guilty and scared all at the same time. I love the Jewish people. NO-ONE should be put through this . To all who don't even believe the Holocaust was real, better make sure you can pass, JUST IN CASE !!!"
2,Not Espresso. Just Brown.,"From the picture here on amazon and on the can when the product arrived I expected this to be an almost black dark brown, but when I sprayed it on my project it came out a medium brown. It isn't even close to matching the espresso colored items I was going to pair it with."
5,Great product for touching up lawn ornaments or repainting your outdoor wicker products and furniture!,"My wife is a major user of Rust-Oleum spray paints. Every spring she needs to buy 4 to 6 new cans. She touches up or repaints everything from bird houses to outdoor furniture and wicker items that she has outside. She even has several statures of children, angels or a young girl sitting on a bench that she paints this color.Doing this every year makes her lawn ornaments look new even though they are many years old. Rust-Oleum is just a first class grade of product and the coverage when painting is very good. This color, Satin Heirloom White goes with so many other colors that you can use it for many applications.There are cheaper paints available but the time spent on the work and finished quality are important so we use Rust-Oleum as we know it works and don't want to have to do the job twice. We like this product and recommend it to you!"
4,Satin iris blue,"My wife bought a small can of this paint at a hobby store to paint some picture frames for her office, been looking and looking for a blue to paint the shutters on our house and finally found close to what we had in mind in this blue, love the satin finish also, although it is a touch on the glossy side for a satin. Ordered one can from amazon to make sure it was the same color. It was the same and liked the shutter that I painted so much ordered several more cans to do the rest of the shutters and also do the front door. Shutters look great, haven't got the door done yet. Just wish that Rust-Oleum would put the better quality adjustable spray nozzle on their products,that some manufacturers use, instead of the cheap one that this product has, it would make application so much nicer. Cant believe it would make that much difference in price either. By the way the picture frames look great also."
1,pissed me off,"it takes WAY TOO MANY cans of spray paint to paint a garage door, WHAT WAS I THINKING? if you're thinking about spraying something bigger than a breadbox, get a brush..."
2,Satin Espresso,Ordered the satin espresso to paint old steel window frames. Turns out it's a lot more red than what I was expecting. Different than what the cap suggests.
2,POOR QUALITY ITEMS,The cans of spray paint purchased did not work well at all - they dispensed only a very small amount of paint before losing pressure completely. My guess is that the items were well beyond their sell-by date or had been stored improperly.Will likely not purchase this type of item from Amazon again in the future.
5,This is an excellent book,"This is an excellent book for people who have mild or moderate dog problems. It is well written with a sense of humor, and with insight into the behavior of dogs. It is a book by a professional trainer, not for professional trainers.Carol Lea Benjamin does not advocate punishment. In fact, she advises to NEVER hit your dog. Appropriately correcting a dog is not a punishment any more than appropriately correcting a child when they run into a street is a punishment. In addition to describing how to properly correct your dog, she points out human behaviors that inadvertantly encourage dog problems, when and how to use praise to encourage positive behavior, how to redirect behavior, and that sometimes, we can eliminate a bad behavior just by removing the trigger."
4,A good sense of writing humor,"This was a well-written book aimed more at the novice dog-owner or someone who's experiencing a problem they've not experienced before. The book is written with a good sense of humor; for example, her final comment about ticks. She also recognizes that there are some ""problems"" that can not be solved, they are just part of being a dog, while other problems that people say are just part of being a dog can be solved. I enjoyed the book and have started trying her method on my German Shepherd, who back-talks as bad as any teenager when told to do something."
4,mostly thoughtful,"To frame the problem of U.S. grand strategy, Brzezinski emphasizes several frames of reference from which to consider the current dilemma. His emphasis is not only on strategic imperatives but also on the moral, cultural and historical situation.The only problem I find with the writing is that Brzezinski tends to become diverted into dissections of many what-if type scenarios. This is fine for a strategic studies expert, however, some of these digressions are somewhat far-fetched. Altogether, its a quick read with some interesting insights into how the U.S. and the world might best proceed."
5,Reliable,"I've used one of the Powertrip's for the last 4 or 5 years in a mobile rig, and I believe the only reason it stopped working is I dropped it hard onto concrete. I'm buying another one. I have no problem getting my brick power cords/adapters plugged in. I had to replace a few light bulbs along the way (Available at Local Ace Hardware), and they can be a bit touchy if you over tighten them, but overall a great product. I just wish they were concrete resistant."
3,Tolerable,"I didn't love these cookie like I did the lemon and ginger ones. The little rice crispies in it made it bad. The cookie is soft and moist then you bite into a hard rice crispy and ""OUCH"" it hurts your teeth, lol. The flavor isn't bad it's just those nasty rice crispies!!! They should replace them for chocolate chips."
4,good cookie,Good cookie. Very filling so 1 is more than enough. Moist and chewy like a good rasin cookie should be and not overly sweet.
2,The devil is in the details...,"Love these cookies. They taste wonderful. No trans fat, vegan, Kosher, healthy ingredients. So what's my gripe? If you look at the nutrition label on the back of the cookie package carefully, notice that a serving is 1/2 a cookie. And, 1/2 a cookie is 210 calories (different from the info on the Amazon site, but I'm looking at the package right now -- same product, current package). So, if you eat the whole cookie (I dare you to stop at 1/2. I know I can't! I tried.), you've eaten a 420-calorie cookie. Wow. That's a lot. Sorry to burst the bubble. I take one of these to work every once in awhile to eat for lunch (and 420 calories is a large lunch for me), but that's the only way I can eat them. I bought these not realizing they'd counted the cookie as two servings (which is pretty sneaky, IMO), and relied on the Amazon site info, which needs to be updated to reflect current package count. Great cookies, but if calories factor in for you, beware."
5,"The Best Cookie I've Had (Oh, and it's Gluten-Free!)","This product is a celiac's dream! Nana's no gluten cookies have by far the most consistent texture of any gluten free cookies that I have tried (including my own homemade). They are hardly distinguishable from a wheat-based cookie. They are extremely soft, and, accordingly, some flavors do tend to be a tad ""crumbly"", e.g. ginger. Lemon is not crumbly."
4,lovely lemon flavor,"This cookie hits just the right note for lemon lovers. Not too sweet, with a nice tangy flavor and no bitter or ""artificial"" taste.It does have a granular texture from the brown rice flour, but that does not mean this is a dry cookie at all. It sort of melts in your mouth."
2,Not so healthy,"Not so healthy! 420 calories per cookie, Ouch!! buy a case and get fat, that's for sure.Totally not worth the added on pounds, you can find vegan non gluten cookies at your local food co-op or trader joes for half those calories.."
4,Awesome cookie!,I saw this cookie at Whole Foods and decided to give it a try. I'm not a huge lemon fan but this cookie is delicious! Plus vegan and gluten free to boot! I'll definately be having it again(and trying other flavors)
2,Good if you love orange,I like orange but do find this a little bit too much. I am ok with the texture which is a little off because of the crisps but the orange is a bitter orange which seems a bit too strong to me. I can eats these but will not reorder them. The other Nana's I have tried were much better.
4,good satisfying cookie,good moist satisfying cookie. I like these cookies because they are natural but still taste good and have enough mass to be satisfying.I also like that they do not crumble and make a mess when I eat them in my office.
3,depends on the box,One of the boxes was very good and fresh. The other box I recieved was very dry and you could tell it had been sitting in the shelf a little too long. Take you chances!
1,Nanas Coconut Chip Cookies,"I was disappointed when I opened my first cookie that was ordered from Amazon. Although I am still eating them, they were stale. When ordered directly from Nanas Cookies, they were so fresh they were falling apart. The aroma was delicious!"
5,THE BEST COOKIE,"I've ordered these cookies several times now and - this is the best place to order them. Nobody sells for a better price. Also, these are great tasting cookies - everybody I know - even people who don't eat healthy - really like them."
1,Does Not Compare To Other Nana's Cookies,These were a sore disappointment to the Nana's brand. I love the Chocolate Chip and Peanut Butter but these were way to dry and powdery. The flavor was good but the texture made my stomach turn.
2,"Disappointing compared to Nana's brownie mint, & peanut butter cookies","Although I love the Nana's brownie mint, and peanut butter flavor cookies, I found the ginger cookie disappointing. It was too spicy to be enjoyable, and more crumbly than the other cookie flavors. (The crumbliness is due to the gluten-free rice flour.)Also, the ginger cookies are more fattening than the other flavors I've had: 360 calories per cookie, compared to the peanut butter at 316 per serving and the chocolate mint at 300 calories.Note that Nana's cookies lists the calorie count as 180 per serving, but they count a serving size as half a cookie."
1,WARNING: NOT Gluten Free,"WARNING WARNING WARNING! I searched for gluten-free oatmeal raisin cookies on Amazon and these cookies came up on the list. These cookies are NOT gluten free. Yes, they contain no wheat, but instead, they have barley flour. Wheat, barley and rye all have natural gluten and *must* be avoided. Do not buy these if you have Celiac disease -- that is, are gluten intolerant.Amazon should fix their search engine to NEVER display products that are not truly gluten free when people search for such. Even now, on the review form, Amazon is suggesting ""gluten free"" and ""celiac"" as tags for this product. That is flat out false."
4,Delicious cookie!,"This is a great tasting cookie! Especially with those delicious crunchy rice crisps! The fat content is quite low as well, which makes it all the more appealing. Keep up the good work!"
1,this cookie is awful,Are you kidding me??? The 90 positive reviews must be the owners relatives. This is the worst gluten free product I have ever eaten. It is dry and it is mealy. The only way it was marginally tolerable was to smother it in chocolate icing. My wife told me to complain to the company and I told her I didn't want them sending me any free product.
5,two kids under four years old both enjoy these cookies,"these cookies are good tasting, ( Child approved), no bad stuff ( parent approved), easily portable ( convenient), soft and moist ( don't make a lot of crumbs in the car seats) 3.5 ounces nice size for a satisfying cookie."
5,Our Nana loved Nana's cookies,"I received a call that the cookies were absolutely delicious. Our ""Nana"" is a fantastic cook, so that is high praise indeed."
1,Not recommended.,"The no gluten cookies are high in carbs, taste really bad & are grainy. Sorry I wasted the money & would NOT recommend them to a friend."
3,Have a beverage handy...,"The first time I tasted one of these cookies, I wanted more. After my 2nd auto-ship of a doz, I've got some regrets. This batch is dry enough to choke a horse, and there are just a couple of chocolate chips to break up the monotony of that great big, bland, dry 380 calorie cookie. As for a 'treat' that is not altogether unhealthy, it still fills the bill, but it's not my favorite."
1,These cookies are TERRIBLE!,"I love any good peanut butter cookie and thought this vendor, Nanas, looked to have pretty good reviews. But I'll tell ya... it's bland bland bland, tastes likes dried paste, horrible. There's a list of ingredients on each package of the stuff they 'don't' put in there like eggs, sugar, etc. Well maybe they should realize that those ingredients are 'what' makes a good cookie. I won't try anything from them again."
5,Great holdover snack,"These cookies are high in fiber and make a great holdover snack in-between meals. Like Nana's other cookies, these are not very sweet. The part I like best are the walnuts that are mixed providing a sublte crunch in these otherwise soft cookie."
5,Best cookie I've ever tasted,"As a newly converted vegan, there's not a lotta sweet food items I can eat that doesn't have milk or some type of milk product or animal product in it (not to mention refined sugars and bleached flours etc). I've tried Alternative Baking Company's double chocolate cookie, which I loved, but per cookie they charge $2 a piece. I searched for another company that makes a similar cookie, and found this company (Nana's). The cookie is every bit as good as the ABC's cookie, and a lot cheaper at that. Hands down the best cookie I've ever eaten. For any vegans or anyone looking to decrease their sugar intake, this is definitely worth trying."
1,"Really, really sandy","I'm sorry to say that I tried the Lemon flavored cookie, and it tasted like someone had taken beach sand, flavored it with a little lemon juice and sweetener, added a teaspoon of water, packed it together, and sold it as a cookie. It was so incredibly gritty that my tongue felt a little raw afterward. It was so crumbly that I couldn't even break pieces off of it to eat them... every time I tried to break a piece off, a big part of the cookie just fell apart. It was like when you're building a sand castle and the sand isn't wet enough... it doesn't hold together. I couldn't finish it."
5,Yummy!,"We love these. They are very yummy! I like that they are made with organic whole grain, and sweetened with fruit juice only, with peanut butter for protein. They are a great snack or treat. They are a nice big size so it's easy for my 2 young sons to share."
3,Religious/Biblical Jumble Mumble of no Consequence ...,"I bought this book thinking it is a political book about the State of Israhell. It is NOT. It is all biblical references upon biblical quotations, upon subjective assumptions/ analysis.I couldn't take it anymore. It assumes that the bible was not written by men who want to control their flock, and especially their harem. Yeah, Israel (Jacob's spiritual name) was used by the Zionists to promulgate their evil state of Israhell. Who cares! The Palestinians will recognize Israel if Israel recognizes them."
2,not enough of a story even for a little child,expected a more detailed storyline. I had read the adult version and told my grandchildren about it. they were very interested. found the child-version to be lacking. grandchildren are 4 and 7.
3,Cinema - Before The Dark,"With a name like Cinema Recorded Music Library, you'd expect the music to be cinematic, and, certainly, they don't disappoint. The title track of _Before the Dark_ takes a simple piano line and adds some quiet embellishments to it, creating a stately, downtempo mood piece. The 70s noir vibe of ""Pendulum"" contrasts nicely with the upbeat funk of ""Almost There."" If you're in the mood of some light disco flavor, ""After Dark"" will happily fill that quotient. ""Lost"" has a pretty delicacy, while ""Crash and Burn"" drifts along on a wobbly guitar until midway, when it holds true to its name, and injects a strong stab of electric guitar and percussion. ""The Dawn"" reprises ""Before the Dark"" as a nice way to round out the album. While not groundbreaking, the album is certainly enjoyable, something to keep in your own personal library."
5,"""*****"" great traditional accordian sound..... as usual.","His music really brings back the great sound of the accordian, the way it was played by our ancestors. Hopefully he'll allow us to enjoy his music for many years like other artists such as Cornelio Reyna and Ramon Ayala"
2,Not near as good as all the reviews say,"It's true that this book is wonderfully organized, and the colorful pictures are great. It's full of a lot of correct information. But for me, the bad outweighed the good.1) Grammar is horrible in this book. Sentence structure is almost non-existant. The person who proofed this seriously needs more practice.2) some of the advise was completely off the way. You would just have to see it to believe some of the advise.All n all, I say spend your money on another book!!"
4,Imposing when not posing,"Leonard Bernstein's <Symphony No. 3:Kaddish> and <Chichester Psalms> are very powerful works, but in them are obvious echoes of Mahler, Carl Orff, and even Respighi. That ""but"" is not pejorative since no work can be utterly original; still I have always found this composer to be a bit of poseur. In the ""Kaddish,"" which is the Hebrew Prayer for the Dead, Yehudi Menuhin is assigned the role of Speaker, while soloists Karita Mattila and others sing in Hebrew with the Chorus, Children's Chorus and Philharmonic Orchestra of Radio France under Yutaka Sado. The anger and bewilderment against a God who can allow such evil to exist is dramatically portrayed more in the music than in the words; while the companion pieces, the ""Chichester Psalms,"" use the device of juxtaposing lines from the Psalms to form equally dramatic contrasts. All in all, this is a very worthwhile set to have and enjoy-although I do wish there were a way of blocking out the spoken parts on subsequent hearings."
3,Not great...,"The length and weight of this necklace is very nice and the beads are nicely graduated.BUT.... the Tigers Eye's look to be poorly painted beads instead of just dyed. If you look at the close up photo, that is exactly what all the beads look like... I think I was hoping for more luster or something.When I was a child, my mother had a large Tiger's Eye ring that shone and captured the light in various ways and was so fascinating to look at.... I think I was expecting something more like that.I give it three stars because the necklace does look wonderful with the dress I wear it with, so it was totally worth the gold box offer price."
2,Of Historical Interest,"""Canterburied Sounds"" is a 4-disc compilation of home tapes and dodgy live recordings made 1962-1972 in Canterbury England, the birthplace of so much great music. Brian Hopper is to be commended for assembling this set -- but truth be told, the sound quality is marginal at best (unlistenable at worst!) and the quality of the music is rarely above ""for SERIOUS collectors only."""
3,READ IF YOU ARE A FAN OF ATMOSPHERE!!!,"regardless of what Amazon tries to imply, this album is NOT done by Slug of Atmosphere fame... It is a rock album, so please, please, don't make the mistake that numerous others have made unless yuo're interested in trying some new rock music...If you are into Slug the band, then buy away... It's just not my gig..."
1,Not Homelite,This product is not as advertised. Is not a Homelite product and does not fit the Homelite Pro-cut trimmer head.
3,Disappointment.,"We thought this would be Peacock's piano music but it is more a jazz ensemble CD. If you want piano music, this is not what you should buy."
4,love this soap BUT...,"i love this soap. it's a fantastic replacement for bottled shampoos full of artificial ingredients and toxic ick. it leaves my hair shiny, soft and clean. i like to follow it with a vinegar rinse (3T vinegar to 24 oz water and 2 drops lavender oil) to make it even more shiny and soft.***however, sodium hydroxide is NOT a ""binder."" it is lye. lye on its own is a caustic chemical processed out of ashes, but when combined in the right proportions with fats turns them into good old-fashioned lye soap. at the end of the process, the fats are no longer greasy and the lye is no longer caustic, and the resulting soap is the best soap around, but i still really prefer manufacturers to be direct about ingredients."
5,I love this product,"This soap is amazing. I struggled with dry skin and dandruff for years. After one use of this soap I noticed an improvement and now I don't have any signs of those problems. I use this for my hair and also a body soap, It foams up nice even in hard water. I recommend it. The smell is also though not perfumed, it does smell clean."
3,Where Is the Sparkle?,"I found this CD very disappointing. To paraphrase Mark Twain, I was hoping for lightning, but found only a lightning bug. Something seems slightly OFF in the blending of their voices in some of the tracks. They are not the worst I've heard, but I have not ""imported"" any of this CD's tracks to my computer's hard drive to listen to while I'm doing other work. Verrett and Caballe are the ones to listen to if you wish to hear how bel canto duets SHOULD be done."
4,"Good, but incomplete","Good compilation, but they somehow missed the Sull'aria duet of Mozart's *Le Nozze di Figaro*, a major oversight for an album titled ""Beautiful Opera Duets""."
1,WARNING!,"I hate everything about this CD, and I hate everything about Lene Lovitch. She is annoying and has no talent. I just want to voice my opinion and prevent people who are searching for decent cds from making a HUGE mistake."
4,Another Great release,"This release contains one of my favorite Lene songs- ""Angels""- ""the angels are watching over you, constantly they say""... It is as good as Stateless, although some of the added songs on this aren't as memorable, with the exception of Blue Hotel. All in all it has great music and great liner notes about the inspirations of the songs, which give you some insight into Lene. I enjoy this CD from time to time and I would recommend it to anyone!"
4,Love Bochco series,"I am new to Brooklyn South but took a chance on the series because of Steven Bochco. I was a huge NYPD Blue fan, so I thought I might enjoy this series. So far, it's really entertaining and I'm glad I bought the DVD set. The service from Amazon was top notch as always."
5,SOUTH BROOKLYN,"I really enjoyed the police-series, SOUTH BROOKLYN, and noticed that many of the players went on to other tv series.IT WAS JUST A PITY THAT THEY ONLY MADE THE ONE SERIES. AS THE CHARACTERS WERE WELL SKETCHED AND BELIEVABLE,AND THE STORY LINES CONSISTANTB.B.WALMSLEY"
2,Not a standout in any way,"The characters go through their motions but it just doesn't meet the standards established by other police dramas. For stories and acting that will keep you looking at the screen rather than at your watch, try The Shield, Law and Order, Foyle's War and A Touch of Frost."
5,"A GREAT, GREAT SHOW !","This was an awesome show that never got a fair chance or good time slot, being up against Monday Night Football where alot of their potential audience would have been. If you like police dramas you need to have this dvd set."
4,another near perfect show let go by the networks.,"this series had everything. wonderful preformances,with writting that was impeccable. from the same who brought us hillstreet and nypd...nypd was at is's prime when this drama could have used the producers added attention as it began to fall thru the network cracks,but i imagine it is near impossible to keep two gold stars shinning at all the right times. when viewership and sched probs arose nypd received the attention it needed and south went south...never-the-less stories,directors,sets and talent are in abundance. this is one that should not be missed...the dvd is too expensive esp. since there are not even subtittles. but the commentary on the pilot alone is worth some of the problems,which are few...top notch."
1,brooklyn south,buyer beware is right. i bought brand new from amazon the first time and like the person said before me all the disc had fingerprints and marks on them. the picture would begin to break up and stop. i sent the set back to amazon and received the new package. all the disc have fingerprints and marks on them. I have not had time to play them yet.I will report on how the dvds play. I am very upset with the producers of dvds. they do not check the quailty of the product. but to amazons credit they do make it right when you have a problem with a purchase.
1,Preaching to the choir,"If you are not already well-steeped in the vocabulary and concepts of feminist theory and American history, don't bother picking up this book -- you won't understand a word of it."
5,Some Helpful Insights...and some Interesting History,"This book is a very easy read and provides some key perspectives on the idea of who we are and why we are here. I was not sure what to expect when I ordered it, but I'm glad I was able to spend some time exploring the wonder of I AM.Progression along the ""I am Not"" path is logical, biblical and certainly relevant in today's i-centred world. Although so many things point to Numero Uno as being one-self, the counter-cultural ""I am Not"" rings true and clear. This is a very timely reminder that God is, has been, and always will be the centre of the Universe.If you have Tweens or Teens in your home this may be an ideal way for them to spend a weekend."
3,Humbly Knowing I Am,"As Louie Giglio weaves a web of his personal stories and Biblical illustrations I am reminded just how small I am and how unimaginably big my God is! And yet through his writing as I delve deeper into the fact that I am not, I realize just how remarkable it is that I have a true relationship with I am.In a society where we all strive for bigger and better there is actually comfort in knowing how small I am. There is peace in intimately knowing the God of the universe, that I can rest in him, that I can find salvation and identity in his son Jesus, who beholds the world."
4,Another great novel by Marillier,"After reading Sevenwaters trilogy I decided Juliet Marillier was an author worth investing time and money in. I was not disappointed in the least. The Dark Mirror's hero Bridei falls in the category of young, brilliant and defiant. This book has much - intrigue, magic, love, plot surprises, and a wonderfully rich background for the story to take place. I recommend this for anyone who enjoyed the Sevenwaters trilogy by Juliet Marillier and the Liveship trilogy by Robin Hobb"
5,Beautifully Crafted Storytelling,"Juliet Marillier is one of my favorite authors. I treasure all of her books. The Dark Mirror, in typical Marillier style, captivates the reader with soulful portrayals of each character. I love how she allows her readers to see so deeply into the hearts and minds of her characters--not just superficial descriptions. I can hardly wait to read the next book of the Bridei Chronicles. Another reviewer criticized The Dark Mirror for being another re-telling of the Arthurian legend. I have read most versions of the Arthurian legend and although The Dark Mirror has some very subtle similarities, Juliet Marillier's tale is carefully crafted, deeply written, fresh and definitely worth reading."
5,Scooby!!,"This re-vamped version of Scooby-Doo is great, I think. A little more dark. Only complaint is the ""romance"" between Velma and Shaggy, I don't like them together. Can't wait for the next season to come out!"
3,"Started Out Great, Very Quickly Jumped the Shark...","When my kids and I first saw that there was a new ""Scooby Doo"" series, we were thrilled-- we're big Scooby fans at this house. And, when we saw that Shaggy and Velma were having a clandestine romance, I thought, ""Oh, how CUTE-- about time!"" And, the Daphne/Freddie thing... also good, because they belong together, too. However... I became disenchanted halfway through the first season, because I became mildly uncomfortable watching it with my kids. The story was too dramatic and soap-opera-y, and the characters were just wrong. Scooby would not have been jealous over Shaggy and Velma dating-- he'd've been happy for them! Velma and Shaggy dating was okay, except it was too much drama, and Velma turned into a crazy stalker. Daphne, by comparison, may have loved Fred, but she wasn't all suicidally obsessed with him like she was freaking Bella Swan, and Fred wasn't a complete freaking idiot. Just... no, no, no..."
5,Mystery Inc,"My daughter, who is four, loves Scooby Doo. We saw some of these on tv and ordered the DVD. We liked it so much we preordered volume 2. I hope to see many more of these to finish the story line (my husband and I are even into the story line and want to see this Mr. E and all that unfolds)."
2,Shouldn't even be called Scooby Doo...,"The good: The ""Mr E"" storyline is very interesting, and the bad guys are some of the creepier looking in the Scooby world - good monsters with good (usually) motives.The bad: The mysteries in this series play second fiddle to the absolutely horrid romance plots - the monsters and the clues seem almost like an afterthought thrown in to keep it from being a soap opera with a talking dog. Freddie, one of the smartest characters in the original series, is a bumbling idiot with no intuition whatsoever. Velma, also one of the smarter series characters, is a whiny, completely unlikeable teenage girl who is possessive, clingy, wanting to change the guy she supposedly likes, who is jealous of a DOG... In fact, she personally makes the show barely, it at all, watchable. Its a train wreck."
1,Enough is enough!!!!!,"When will studios like Warner Bros. and all the rest realize that the majority of customers want season sets?!?! Hey, why not release a season set and a volume 1 at the same time? That way season set people like my self will be happy, and the show samplers will be happy too? BTW, the one star is for the dvd single disc release, I give the show itself a solid 4 stars."
1,Aspect Ratio: 1.33:1?????,"Am I seeing things or is this widescreen show released in an aspect ratio of 1.33:1? Please God, tell me this is an error...this can't be happening. Or can it?Thank goodness for the english. According to amazon.co.uk they will release the same title in Aspect Ratio: 16:9 - 1.78:1. If this is correct (remains to be seen, such info has been proven erroneous before) than the UK is way ahead of the US in this respect.Shame on you!!!Thank you and good night from Sweden"
1,"Review of Product, NOT Show","I'd like to pick this up for my son, but he's going to have to wait, as should you.Studios are increasingly catching on to the 'double dip' of multiple versions of the same product. Extended vs. theatrical release is somewhat forgivable, but breaking up seasons into volumes is a blatant money-grab.Basic points to skip this release:The show is broadcast in HD -- an HD release is possible.*This is an actively produced and re-fun show (you can 'tape it' and wait)Unless you're chucking the case, this is going to take up more room in your collection than a full set willIf you honestly can't wait for this and don't care about possibly re-purchasing the same thing later, I doubt you'd be reading the reviews; if you're on the fence, at least wait for a full season 1 release before purchasing.*This argument isn't guaranteed, however. Camp Scare, so far, was the only Scooby-Doo Cartoon released on Blu-Ray."
2,"Fun show, poor value.","I bought this, and the other two volumes that complete the series, for my daughter, who just can't get enough of Scooby Doo.However, three discs, packaged and sold individually at an average of $10, brings me to a total of about $30 for a SHORT (12-episode) season.Add to that the fact that the plastic cases are beyond flimsy, and I'm not feeling like this was my best-value Amazon purchase.The compression quality is not exactly stellar either, which is inexcusable given how little material is on each disc."
5,Great for puzzlers,"I have used this dictionary for over 25 years and have worn out my copy. It is well organized, easy to research, and has the answers."
3,Out of Date,"I bought this book because my old one was outdated, particularly the name section. Because of the new cover I thought this book had been updated. I was wrong. This is the same old 1994 or older book with a new cover. This is a good book for solving puzzles but sadly outdated. I'm sorry I bought it but it isn't worth the trouble to return it."
3,dell crossword dictionary,"I am pleased with the book, which appears to be a carbon copy of one I already had. I would make the following suggestion and that is that they update the names of people included names section of the book. Other than that it is just fine."
4,Crossword Dictionary,This dictionary is very useful. It has info not normally found in otherdictionaries. I would just like a more coverage of topics.
1,service,"The product was what I was lo9oking for but the service stinks and I willnot do business wiht amazon again because of it, What was wrong? Answer your emails and you will find out."
1,lousy,I do not like this book at all. Th previous Dell crossword book was much better. This one is difficult to use and find meanings. I will be purchasing the previous one. I have already had three and used them until they were in tatters. This one will remain in good shape for a long time.
1,Dell Crossword Dictionary,Product was not as pictured on the internet. Had to send back 3 times as it wasn't what I ordered. Picture of item was wrong issue.
2,The Dell Crossword Dictionary,"Very disappointed in this book. Not enough definitions for words and far too many pages used for Word Finder which seems nearly useless.After waiting eagerly for it to arrive in New Zealand it was a big let down. After receiving the Websters New World crossword dictionary, which is great, we felt nothing for this book."
3,large type?,"Well, I tried to purchase a large type crossword dictionary as a gift.It's not large type, but I'll keep it to use myself."
1,Review of Dell Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,This book is the same as the one I bought many years back which is now fallen apart. The picture of the cover does not match the copy I received. The information are not updated. It will not last long as streaks have started appearing on the back as I open and close the book.
2,The Dell Crossword Dictionary,"Ths is a fair crossword dictionary for puzzler's alike. I do one in our local paper, give me some advice on Crossword Dictionary's. Plwease."
5,Dell Crossword Dictionary,"I found this book to be extremely useful reference when solving crossword puzzles, especially when the question involved peoples names who were either semi-famous or relatively unknown. Also very useful with questions about US presidents and vp's. Overall, a very useful book and worth the cost."
1,A discrace,I would have to say this is a disgrace to the crow series I'm a fairly new fan of the crow. Having bought the first without having seen it. i rented the others on blockbuster second had a six week wait so i just bought it for 5.00. the second was OK having a mini link to the first one explaining the story. havn't seen the 3rd yet. blockbuster sent me the forth and i was all ready for the darkness of the crow. instead i got a horrible excuse for a sequel i mean Eddie drew on his face with a sharpie and barley had any white. the cast was not well put together and the plot oh god don't even get me started. I tried to finish it in case something better happened but no. so don't even waste your time or money. nothing will top the original. nobody could do better than Brandon.
1,the worst crow yet,"one review for this film said that before you give it a one star rating, to watch it first. well i have. this is a far cry from the first film. i cannot believe that it has come to this. there was nothing in wicked prayer that i could honestly say i liked. the acting was poor, boreanaz was the most annoying in my opinion.furlong was wrong for the role of the crow, he just does not have the presence to carry this film. people in other reviews say you cannot compare this to brandon lee's film. they are different films about different characters. this is true, but at least brandon gave a legendary performance.this film is only for those that have the first three films and want the complete set, and for those people a message: dont get your hopes up. this is a let down"
1,"I managed to get through this movie without losing my mind, others were not so lucky!","I love The Crow movies! The first Crow with Brandon Lee is one of my all time favorites!The Crow: City Of Angels... well, they took the first crow movie and pretty much dragged itthrough the dirt, but it turned out to be an okay movie!The Crow: Salvation: A B-movie/made for T.V. movie... second rate cinema but not bad in theend though!Now... The Crow: Wicked Prayer;What I didn't like about this movie:1. The diolague made no sense at all!2. The plot made no sense!3. The score was a waste!4. So many actors who made themselves look bad by being in this movie (EdwardFurlong, Tara Reid, David Boreanaz, etc.)!5. Edward Furlong's make-up kept changing through-out the movie!8. Even the special features were bad!9. The book 'The Crow: Wicked Prayer' was good but this movie was terrible!Bottom line: This movie is one of the worst movies ever made!Avoid it at all costs! I'm not even close to kidding!My grade: F or no stars!"
1,Failure of a movie,"Terrible movie. I liked all the other Crow movies this one is an embarrassment. Rent it before you buy it for yourself and I think you'll agree. I helped you out. By the way I own all the first three this one is nothing even close to them. Bad acting, horrible story, unrealistic ideas makes for a failure of a movie."
1,Please stop making Crow Films,"The first Crow Film, including plot, eventually evolved from Brandon Lee's death. The first film was going to include the Skull Cowboy from the Comic. The Power of the crow could not be stolen from him by hurting the bird. This is a Testimate to how all of the films after the first have failed. This film and 2-3 tried to build on a story line that was never supposed to be and should not have been. As seen by their success. The movie The Crow was amazing, and made so by Brandon's performance along with his supporting cast. I admit some of the scenes filmed after his death were cheesey, and that the actors did not seem, AT ALL, very thrilled to do them. All of that a side. You can't build on the accident that made the first film. They should have starting with Part 2, tried to stick with the original story, and maybe, just maybe, they could have made the wrong this right!"
1,I Want My 90 Minutes Back!,"If I tell you that Tara Reid is the best actor in Wicked Prayer, does that give you some idea? Edward Furlong is appalling. Look at the extras, where he's interviewed, and you'll see him for the burned out shell he is. David Boreanaz is hammy, as usual, and Dennis Hopper is slumming it for the money, and almost says as much. There has only been one good Crow film (the first). All the films are seedy and distasteful, but this was just amateurish. I could have done better with a group of friends. Oh, and did anyone tell them this was supposed to be scary?"
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS,"DEFINATELY The worst of all the crow films, i have even enjoyed the other three films but after watching this movie i want my hour and a half back. bad storytelling, bad acting (but whaddya expect with tara reid & eddie furlong) bad movie. JEFFSTER says avoid at all costs."
1,The Crow Wicked Prayer,"Didn't really need more than one Crow movie, but I am a David Boreanz fan so I wanted the movie. David plays a good part, gets to be evil (a bit like playing Angel when he goes evil but without the vamp side). I wish they would of cast someone besides Tara Reid and Eddie Vetter in the movie, it might have been better then."
1,Top 5 worst movies of all time.,"This movie is awful, I still can't believe I paid money for it. I want the last two hours of my life back! The good; The concept was really cool, it had real potential and David Boreanez was great. The Bad; The storyline was terrible, aimless and not really cohesive. The acting was awful... the casting was just as bad. The soundtrack wasnt bad but could have been much better, like it didn't quite do the job. The writing and directing was what really made this movie a winner. It was like someone handed the story to a 14 year old kid with no vision. BAD BAD BAD. The really sad thing is this could have been a really great movie, and no, budgeting wasnt the problem. The fight scenes were ok, its just the rest was ridiculous, it just needed half their actors replaced and a director with much more talent. Really a shame."
3,A swing in the right direction,"I found the second film in the series to be putrid, and the third to be even worse, so I wasn't expecting a lot from this. I was impressed. The first film was a classic for the ages. The first two sequels tried to duplicate the feel of the original, and failed miserably - as much due to terrible scripts as to anything else. This one went a different direction, seeking to develop its own personality, taking the legend of the Crow back to its Native American roots. It's nowhere near the quality of the original - then again, that would be very difficult to accomplish since the original was a masterpiece, but it's still pretty entertaining. I felt they could have done more with the soundtrack, but again, they may have chosen to go simple in that area to distinguish it from being just another lousy copy of the original like the others were. But the story was solid, and the acting was pretty good too. It's no 5, but it's not a 1 either."
3,another crow movie?,"i was doing some internet research on this movie and found out they actually screened it in hollywood a few months ago. i read that i was actually decent, even though furlong as the crow seems ridiculous, and david boreanaz as a villain? his role in valentine was horrible. but i heard he plays a decent villain, also with tito ortiz along his side(UFC fighter)tara reid? what more can i say?though surely nothing will compare to the first crow. the 2nd was less than decent, the 3rd was more than a horrible attempt to profit off the crow's story line."
1,THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL OF THE CROW,"When the first Crow came out, it blew the audience away. People loved it. They wanted more. What we got was some crappy-@$$ movies based on themes from the original Crow. This is the third sequel to a movie loved by comic fans. This is the third time we've been let down. And this is the third time Brandon Lee has rolled over in his grave to take a sh*t on the people who made these crappy movies. If you want a decent Crow movie (like me) lets have the Wachowski brothers pull a little Matrix magic out of their bags and restart a franchise that could have been big, but instead went quickly down the crapper."
1,i am now spiritually crippled,"If you have seen the first Crow, then you have seen the rest. If you have also seen the third installment in addition to the first one, then you have seen the fourth one. There is nothing new here. There is nothing good here. It's the exact same images, elements, story, and climax of the previous movies, but with one-dimensional actors that should never have been allowed to have characters in this movie. It's a disgrace to the original. I hated, literally, every minute of this movie. I feel like a worse human being for watching it."
1,Dear god!,Terrible! This movie is a shame for the whole crow franchise! I stoped in the middle and never watched it again since then!
3,Nothing compares to the first,"Lets face it, nothing compares to the first one (god bless Brandon Lee) but i have to admit this one wasnt that bad. i really liked the four horseman idea. and like every crow movie, there are some pretty B.A. lines. I still cant figure out why the flabby dance did anything to help but whatever. still a pretty good movie."
2,crow wicker prayer? How About Wicked Movie!,"ok I own the movie and it's something you could watch late on night on tv but that's it. The only person who did a decent job was Mr. Chong. There is no real fight scenes that's worth talking about, it's more or less something you'd see in the streets. Oh yeah I'll say this Dennis Hooper had some very funny moments. The reason i gave it two stars was because I keep hoping there will be another one that can be better than the last. I will say this, it's the worst of the series. Ed didn't look believable unless he was suppose to played a drag queen. They need to get a better makeup artist. I wish they call me, I'd have a better idea on a storyline for the movie."
3,Not the Best of The Crow Sequels....,"Of course this movie cannot top the first crow, but comparing this to the other sequels,in this series,I believe this one is better then City Of Angels,but not as good as Salvation. This is a must see though for any fan of The Crow movie series. Edward Furlong does a good job as the crow."
1,Avoid at all costs!,"I'm a big fan of movies along this line of story telling. I can also appreciate a low budget movie. I am quite fond of and I own many B movies. That in mind... avoid this unless it is the final piece in the collection you just have to complete!Crow-Salvation was one of the best follow ups to the original. The Prophecy series is decent even up to #5. Wicked Prayer tried to open a new angle within the premise of the storyline and it just wasn't pulled off well. The ""Demon Worshippers"" were not believable. This would have been disappointing if it had been an episode of Buffy. Higher budget on the Buffy by the looks of it."
2,Only Edward,"Hi at first sorry about my english, im from Argentina.Im a fan of crow movies. Wicked prayer its a bad movie. Is not bad like salvation, but is bad. I belive, edward furlong is a great actor, buet the movie doesnt have camera and special efects, money (generally), and the story its big!I want a 5th movie with eddie and a lot of good actors and a super production like the first crow!"
1,THE CROW SHOULD CROAK,"THE CROW franchise should cease production; this is such an abominably ineffective movie from start to finish. Problem # 1: Edward Furlong does not have the physical presence or acting chops to make a convincing weapon of vengeance. He's too laconic and dull. 2. The addition of the Satanic cult makes no sense nor does it really make for an exciting confrontation. 3. David Boreanaz and Tara Reid are about as compatible as water and fire. Boreanaz overacts while Reid just looks pretty. 4. The usually good fight scenes are horrifically staged and the camerawork is pedestrian at best.Do us a favor, send the Crow to a bird sanctuary and stop making these bad films."
1,Should have been ALOT better,"I have read a lot of reviews about this movie and I must say...so one really hit the nail on the head. This movie has both good points and bad points. The only good points are the fact that it has all the main parts of the Crow story...guy dies horrible death for wrong reason...comes back to life for revenge. Other than that...nothing else good about the movie. If anyone is a real Crow fan, I highly recommend they read the book. This movie was based, loosely I might add, on a book written by Norman Partridge. The book was awesome. One of the best Corw stories written so far. Lance Mungia BUTCHERED it when he made this into a movie. Its one thing to turn a book into a movie and its a completely different thing to do what they did to this story. We all know that its very possible to make a good movie out of a book, but I really wish I knew what Lance Mungia was smoking when he wrote the screenplay for this."
5,"Brings ""Bird"" soaring to life!","Charlie Parker was one of the most influential and important musicians of the 20th century. His musical creations and innovations shaped the face of jazz in many profound ways. In his hands the alto saxophone transcended being a mere instrument and became a means of spreading love and hope. In this classic biography we see all sides and facets of this complex and truly brilliant man. He was; a practical joker, womanizer, alcoholic, heroin addict, charming con man and over-eater extraordinaire. A legend is brought marvelously to life here, unlike in Clint Eastwood's well-intentioned but depressingly one-sided movie ""Bird."""
4,"Very fun too read, but is it all true???","This book is a very fun book to read. It's written in novel form, as well, and you can just think of how Parker's life must have been like. But the problem is with Russell, that he seems to be building his book too much around myths. This makes the book fun too read, but you can just wonder if it's true or not. For example, Russell made Benedetti a much better sax player than he originally was, which makes us so incredibly impressed over Charlie PArker, that it's unbelievable. But don't get me wrong, Charlie Parker is a jazz titan, and he really knew his stuff, but if Russell had documented every source of information, lots of things, I believe, would have been erased. Then the book would be a bit more boring. But read it, because it describes the atomesphere of the late-40s America, very well."
3,"Good, but pretentious","Ross Russell produced many Bird's historical sessions and witnessed him collapsing in California. So, he's the right man to write about Charlie Parker. On the other hand, his literary pretentions almost spoil his efforts. Buy Rob Reisner's ""Bird"" instead of this book."
4,A response for Richard...,"Dear Richard, you must read the next verse as well...Romans 2:5 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;Certainly God's goodness is the only reason any of us are alive today, but if we continue to harden and refuse to repent, we will see the WRATH OF GOD...read it carefully!"
1,I can answer the title of this book....,"JESUS is what ""happened"" to the wrath of God.1 John 2:2Jesus Christ is the propitiation (wrath-appeasing sacrifice) for not our sins only but also for the sins of the whole world.Romans 2:4It is the Goodness of God that leads man to repentence."
4,Rarely do great beauty and great virtue dwell together (Petrarch),"""Rarely do great beauty and great virtue dwell together (Petrarch)."" This, a quote, prior to the Prologue of Peter Schechter's *Point of Entry.* How apt it summarizes Schechter's book. Yes, it was a really good read in spite of its smattering of the ""s"" and ""f"" words. It is a good read in spite of the fact that the reader is reminded over and over of Marta Pradilla's (Colombia's 1st female pres) great beauty. Intrigue, politics, smuggling, how could Schechter go wrong (and by the way, did I mention how beautiful Pradilla is)? It opened my mind and even had me lugging out that huge geography book that mom gave me one Christmas to look up the names of some of the locations that I'd never heard of. I may recommend it to my hub. Beautiful."
4,Exciting first effort,"Reading this book, it's hard to believe it's a first novel. The plot is a good one, quite believable, and brings together world leaders in a different way. The characters are smart and behave in manners I think of as being consistent to their places in the political arenas of individual countries. The pace is fast and I found it difficult to put down. I would have given it the 5 star rating, except for it did bog down in some places. For example, I felt it spent too much time explaining how to get an email address. Since it takes place sometime in the near future, I'm not so sure a president of the United States wouldn't already understand how to use email and instant messaging. Also the writing is somewhat choppy in a place or two. But over all it is an excellent read.I'm really looking forward to reading more from this very talented new author. I would highly recommend it to espionage thriller readers."
4,How To Pray,"Although an older version, the book came in good shape and is very helpful. I was able to read the book before class begins."
5,THE BEST book on prayer.,"I have read many books on prayer but this one stands out head and shoulders above all others. Though it was written at such a different time in history, it is just as relevant today. What R.A. Torrey does in this book is much more than teach dry methods. Rather, he imparts to the reader the true spirit of prayer and how vital it is in practicality to our lives on a daily basis. A MUST for any believer serious about having a true, intimate relationship with their ""Abba Father."""
5,Excellent study on prayer through the scriptures!,This book is going on my top ten list of recommended reading for young believers. Torrey explains in easy to understand language the principles of effective prayer laid out in the scriptures. A must-read for anyone desiring to improve upon their prayer life!
5,Moved and Encouraged,"This book helped me in a sense that I could assure me, ""I am not alone.""This book does not offer you the solution/cure to TN.However, it gave me the warnings for the future medical/legal decisions.As a TN patient, although the type of TN that I suffer and the type of the TN that the author suffers are different, I have gone through the very similar experiences with dental/medical/legal professionals.So it was very difficult and relieving for me to know that I was not alone.This book is good for ""Reality Check.""This book gave me a courage to live despite of everything, since now I know that there exists a person who has guts to keep living.I thank the author."
4,Among Jeffrey's strongest and most pleasant efforts.,"Jeffrey Osborne's skills as a soul balladeer are evident on such numbers as ""In Your Eyes"", ""Come Midnight"", ""We Belong To Love"" and ""Room With A View"". This 1986 release was one of Jeffrey's strongest albums but it did not duplicate the success of 1983's ""Stay With Me Tonight"" (although both albums are quite similar as far as the choice of material and production are concerned). The only track you should skip is ""Love's Not Ready""- a truly mediocre uptempo beater that does not belong here."
4,One of His Best,Emotional is one of Jeffery Osbournes better works. I'm surprised more people into R&B don't own a copy of Emotional.
3,Something Missin',"Generally enjoyable but inconsistent effort by JO; however, as usual the stronger tracks (Woo Woo, Emotional) make up for some of the album's other failings (Love's Not Ready in particular; don't know what they were thinking here!). Overall not one of his best projects as the various styles don't blend together into a cohesive whole. Some tracks are too ""studio"" as well."
1,Goes nowhere is right,"I came here to rant about this hand creme and see someone else has beat me to it. This is the first Philosophy product that has let me down and let me down in a big way. The creme is light and feels good, but it doesn't look or feel like it goes on or absorbs well at all. After it's applied it glistens, and I'm constantly noticing areas that lack that effect and looks dry, so I find myself constantly reapplying it. And now after a week and a half of daily use it's half gone. I didn't have this problem with L'Occitane so I guess I'll go back to that unless I find something better."
4,smells yummy,I love the light lemon scent. And even better is the fact that this does not leave my fingers all greasy when I apply it. It melts right into my skin! I love shea butter and I like to find new products with shea butter in them. I also dab it on blemishes and it soothes them and they clear up more quickly.
2,ok lotion and very small,I just received this lotion. It is ok...i wouldnt say its amazing. the tube is so small {for $10.00} I had to make sure that it wasnt just a sample bottle. I think it should last me about 2-4 days at the most. the smell is lemon and light.....nothing great. If you want to try a great hand and body lotion that is not at all greasy and very light weight try body drench!!!!! the lotion is great and you could buy it {on amazon} for $8.95 and its a big bottle and will last you forever. It is even great as a facial moisturizer and the scent is very light and nice. I would not reorder this stuff again.
2,"Smells Great, but...","I needed a good handcream that would leave my hands feeling soft and not rough, so I purchased this little bottle in hopes it would do the trick.I'm actually very disappointed with this handcream. It is rather greasy and almost sticky feeling. From the picture I assumed a normal handcream with maybe a mild scent, but my bottle came labled as being ""Handmade Lemon Custard Hand Cream"". While the scent was delicious (and made me crave Lemon Bars...), the product itself left me rather disheartened. Even twenty minutes after thoroughly rubbing in the product, my hands are still greasy feeling.Perhaps it is back to the drawing board for philosophy on this one..."
2,"My mom loves it, I dont think its worth the money","This is my moms favorite lotion, so I bought it to try it out. It just seems like regular over priced lotion to me. Ill stick with Bath and body works"
3,Double Cross on DVD format,"I found this harmless little screenplay very good. What made it more interesting to me is the fact that a friend of mine played a feature role - Pauline Moore, who was born here in Harrisburg, PA. The photography and reproduction on DVD format was quite good. I'm trying to put together Pauline's film work in DVD format, and it's presenting me a challenge. I might point out that Miss Moore was featured also in four of Roy Roger's pictures. She had a bit part in the first Frankenstein movie as one of the bridemaids."
5,"The finest soccer magazine, period","Wit, massive amounts of information and tremendous writing in a single package can be yours thanks to When Saturday Comes. You'll have trouble reading other soccer magazines after you pick up WSC."
5,Online Copy Available,"Great book for those who want to get into file system design, but don't know where to start. It's been out of print for a little while, but I contacted the author and he was happy to release a pdf of it on his website: http://nobius.org/. I would highly recommend it!"
1,The Prophecy,"Wasnt as good as the first movie. It only goes for 1hour and 15 mins which is too long, its that boring.I would rate it 1 out of 10."
1,Do Not Be Fooled,There are NOT 4 movies in the set. Anyone who wasted their money thinking they were getting new Veggie movies (like me) is going to be sorely dissappointed. This set has what they have already released.Toy that saved Christmas and The Star of Christmas.It has a Very Veggie Christmas on CD.And another CD.I was so excited because I was waiting for them to put A Very Veggie Christmas on DVD.Since there is no product description and the photo is decieving I bought it.There are 4 discs alright.2 DVDs and 2 CDs.If you already have this seperately dont waste your money on this set unless you really want the extra CD.
3,I should have looked closer,"When I saw this product, I thought it was 4 holiday movies. I should have looked more closely at the cover image. It is actually 2 movies and 2 music CDs. I wish I had bought the Holiday double feature instead."
2,I wasn't impressed.,"Artemis OakGrove and I have different opinions as to what is erotic and what isn't. Her lesbians are all mostly butchy, and she doesn't seem to care much for pretty feminine women, even as victims. To me her stories are a little too much realism, and not enough fantasy."
4,regarding Citrate/Oxide blend,I contacted Nature's Way about the relative amounts of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide and they stated that it contains about 60% citrate and 40% oxide.
3,It was alright,The product was okay. I received it within a week and it was sealed/unopened. The product was exactly as described.
2,Disappointed in Amazon and Seller,This was advertised as a new item. It is definitely not a new phone. The receiver has a scratch in it and it was repackaged. I paid a lot for the item - probably 3x retail as I was replacing the phone for someone who really liked the one they had before it went defective. It's disappointing to pay that much and not have it be brand new.
3,one good and one bad,"We have two of these phones. The first one (about a year old) is the oldest and works great... no complaints. The second one (about 9 months old) has not been very good. Occationally on an incoming call, the ringer will ring solid for about 30 seconds (even if you answer the phone). Lately the LCD display on the base unit started going out and is now unreadable. I love the design, it just needs a little more quality."
1,"a ""Real"" dissapointment","JUST PLAIN AWFUL. This isn't a real diary, it's a middle aged man's attempt at being cute, and it fails horribly. Whatever charm or wit it may have is completely obscured by relentless effort to be 'pwecious'. The spelling and grammar are so ridiculous it completely destroys the creditability of the narrative voice.Take the worst elements of Dennis the Menace, The Little Rascals, and The Family Circus and you've got a fair idea of both the intellectual level and writing style.That Shute was called 'the Mark Twain of Exeter' proves that even in 1902, PR was more important than talent.Don't waste your time with the free download until you've taken a look at the sample pages. If you can bear it, your stomach is stronger than mine."
1,It is poor!,"If you take the MELAB test, it wouldn't support your study because it is just manual and guide book. Furthermore, in foreign student's case, reading is not easy to understand.Also, if you want to take a sample test, you should find another one."
1,Garbage,"It is so sad that the American Pharmaceutical Association and the FDA continue to try to hand us such garbage. They try to sell us drugs that don't work and keep us from attaining information and medicines that do. All this under the guise of ""protecting"" us, while Europeans and Asians enjoy good healthy living using natural medicines that have worked for centuries. Simply look into the German Commission E Monographs for actual INFORMATION and not this misleading, inaccurate corporate babble."
1,Holt Handbook--paperback,"Amazon does not describe this as being an exercise book, and so I was very disappointed when I received it. The Holt Handbook that I read was a 1989 issue and so I thought that my purchase would be an updated version."
1,This book is not worth it...,I've had this book for 4 years and have not used it and I'm a college student. Anyone who speaks English shouldn't need a book like this. Spend your money on a movie.
2,Poor quality,"Am so disappointed. This clock is poor quality. The pendulum is plastic and really looks quite pathetic. I am returning today as I feel embarrassed to display on my wall. I agree with a previous review, you certainly can pay much more for a clock, but for this quality, I expect to pay much much less."
4,I became a believer.,"I was a believer in First Aid and Blue Prints books that I used for steps 1 and 2. There was no Step 3 First Aid at the time and so I tried this book. This turned out to be an excellent book for step 3 review. It covered the topics sufficiently for adequate review. I used this book in conjunction with ""Boards and Wards"" and worked questions in the NMS step 3 books as well as the kaplan q-bank. That works. Most say that it is not necessary to spend much time studying for step 3. This is true, but you do need to study some. This book reads quickly and the information is high yield. I highly recommend it and hope that new editions are released over the years."
3,Not a bad book,This book does have lots of info but sometimes there is a line between a review book and a text book and this one was somewhere in the middle in my opinion. If that is what you want then this is the book for you.
3,The stories are funny but the packaging is so-so,"The thing here is to not confuse the real-life stupid (and funny) stories with the packaging that these stories are delivered to us.While each story is condensed to about a page there is a regular attempt on each and every account to hide some little fact at the start of the story, use that hidden fact as the punch line, and then finish the story with some poor pun on the crimial being caught, spending time behind bars, etc.On any given item it works, but it quickly becomes tedious when reading the book cover to cover.I think this book is best taken by reading no more than 3 or 4 stories at a time, or for reading one aloud and your next gathering of friends.The cover price is a little high in my estimation. Get it at a discount and you'll do ok."
5,Thomas Chain Bible,I gave this Bible as a gift to my Pastor and he loved it! Thanks for making such a great purchase available!
5,Great and Wonderful Condition :),"The Customer service was extremely helpful with meeting my request. I had a little problem and they went out of their way to help me.. I was extremely happy with the product (bible) that was a gift for a friend, I was kinda worried because it was used but the product in fact looked completely new. I will diffidently start here when looking for bibles or books. Thank you again Elaine!"
2,Bible print size,This was supposed to be a large print edition. Their definition of large certainly is different than mine. I would call it a small to tiny print. I would never have bought it if I had seen the print size.This is a very large bible with much blank space on both sides of the page which makes it much larger than it needs to be.
3,Not as comprehensive as expected,"I have only half read this book but I find it falls short of my expectations. I've taken some European history courses in university and I find little so far that I wasn't already aware of. I was disappointed in the brief way in which the medieval period was dealt with (as if the 1000 years between the Roman Empire and Martin Luther could be summed up with one chapter of a book of German history). Also, I find it odd that the book never mentions the Hanseatic League and barely mentions the order of the Teutonic Knights and the effects of these institutions on German and Central/Eastern European history."
1,"A broad brush, unenlightning and inaccurate overview","Other reviewers have also noticed the blunder of placing the Maginot line in WWI, which reminded me of the student who once referred to the nazi secret police as ""the gaspacho."" An earlier inaccuracy was the description of revolutionary France as having attacked the rest of Europe in 1792, when the first battles occurred on French soil.Although familiar with the broad outlines of German history, I was hoping to find answers to such nagging questions as how the nation of Mozart, Einstein and Freud, that led the world in math and physics, and invented the automobile and the jet engine, could have given itself such disastrous leaders as William II or Adolf Hitler. The book's introduction led me to believe that the author had new answers, but I didn't find any."
2,Weak history of the German People,"I've read Ozemont before (his Reformation book was OK), but this is a mess. I came to it looking for a brief overview of German history to fill in some blanks, but instead found a mash-up between a looking back from WWII and an attempt at that brief history. What results has the worst of both...in fact, for a German history, there is no worse remark I can level than to say that it simply isn't nearly thorough enough...If Ozemont wanted to do something about how the Nazis raped German history for their own ends, that's another book. Not this one."
4,These are small,These are really pretty earrings but are smaller than I imagined. Also the backs fit loosely and I nearly lost one the first time I wore them.
5,aWeSoMe!!,"This cd is the best! His songs are awesome, because he has sang wit EMINEM! So buy this cd its the best and cheep!"
3,Potential,"Obie's pretty good, but nothing special. There are some good tracks on this album, the highlights being Don't Come Down, %#$& Hits The Fan, Never Forget Ya, and Oh! Obie's pretty good, but most of the succes of his album is because of Em and Dre. But if he comes out with another album, I'll buy it."
4,Worth Reading Today,"Lukacs' sordid political history does not entirely overturn this intimidating collection of Marxist essays from the early 20s. With the theoretical exposition of such perplexing notions as ""reification"" and the ""unity of consciousness,"" Lukacs established much of what was to become critical theory. Despite his disavowed idealism, Lukacs' thinking on the structure of class consciousness is among the most nuanced in the Marxian tradition, and it remains critical to any theoretical understanding of the method of dialectical materialism. While much of his meanderings in ""Reification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat"" are poorly structured, one can't help but be excited through his detours into the major intellects of German Idealism. Nevertheless, he fails to give a full explanatory account of the relation between materiality and class consciousness. And as a result, his analysis falls right back into Hegelian Idealism."
3,Is this what you want?,"If you went to a gym and all of the trainers were 98 pound weaklings, wouldn't you go to another gym? Use some common sense. This book is based on a completely false premise that the so-called yogi's described in this book are actually ""enlightened"" beings and that their conceptions of reality and their practices can actually be of some benefit to you. Yeah, if you want to end up a celibate ascetic just follow the path that these guys did and you can end up just like them. Is this what you really want? Is this what it really means to be a realized yogi united with your eternal infinite Self?"
4,Very descriptive spiritual tour of india.,I read this book twice and I feel like reading it again. This book is a tour about life and spiritual experiences of Sages and Saints who do pennence in search of the divine light. A must read.!Happy Reading!
2,"shapeless, oversized, but inexpensive","First, the material is strangely thick and stiff for athletic shorts. This would be good material for sweats in cold weather but these are shorts so all it does is collect sweat. The shorts are poorly shaped with oversized legs. This feels odd due to the stiff material. I feel like I'm running inside them instead of wearing them and I imagine this looks a little funny. Finally, no pockets limit their usefulness. Unless you need to save ten bucks, look at other pairs."
2,Cheapest possible...and no pockets.,"In my drawer, I have an old pair of Russell cotton workout shorts which are comfortable and long lasting. So I wanted to have more. Knowing that the model I had was older, I couldn't find the exact thing. So I settled on the Russell Cotton workout short (42175MO). It arrived quickly and as ordered; however, the short itself is cheap and thin. It is so poorly shaped that it is uncomfortable in the legs. The fabric and the make are so low quality that I felt cheated. What's worse, the pants have no pockets. I can't use something this poor. I threw them away."
5,Athletic short,"These shorts are very comfortable and loose, fall very well in the body, the material is soft, well made, the elastic waist are well reinforced,and I like them."
2,No Pockets,It's my own fault for not reading the description more carefully. A bit long- I like to see my legs when I squat. Otherwise sturdy and reliable shorts.
2,"Nice, but I don't care for opera!","I should have reviewed this more carefully; somehow I missed that it was mostly operatic. So the 2 stars is not really a commentary on the quality of the music. I'd heard a sampling on our classical station, but they only played an instrumental section. I'm not qualified to comment on anything operatic, but I do like Phillip Glass. I'll need to check out some of his other albums to find what is more to my tastes."
4,"When you think about it, the advice is obvious...","but it really does help to hear it from a professional. It's almost like someone telling you that it's okay to throw out odd screws and socks and other ridiculous things that you think you'll use ""some day,"" but, surprise, surprise, the day never comes. Have applied it to my desk...now I just have to hit the closets and the rest of the house. If you've ever wondered what should stay and what should go, this is definitely the book for you. I'm probably going to purchase _Speed Cleaning_ next."
5,Saint Jeff,"Jeff Campbell, guru of The Clean Team, and author of the books *Speed Cleaning* and *Spring Cleaning,* chides and guides the reader to declutter one's domestic existence - the better to clean around, my pretty!It's a Holy War against Clutter and Chaos, in which Less really *is* More. If you are tired of living like Fibber McGee, get this book. Then READ it. Don't just leave it lying around in the midst of all the incoming mail clutter.Campbell first lies down The Uncluttering Rules, #1 of which is: ""When in Doubt, Throw It Out!"" and then, with compassion and humour, goes through The Psychology of Clutter. He grants dispensation from guilt of liberating oneself of Gawd Awful gifts from well-meaning friends and relatives. Then there are ""Uncluttering Guides: An Alphabetical List"" of Clutter Combat Zones. It is a truly emancipating experience.Cannonize Campbell!TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
