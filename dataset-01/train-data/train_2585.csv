5,A Concise History of an Historic City,"The Greek town of Thessalonike abounds in historic architectural treasures; this little book describes the most noteworthy ones. A brief history of the city is given, whereby a plan of the Roman and Medieval town is compared with a map of the modern city center. Existing architectural, sculptural, and mosaic monuments are covered, both in situ and in photos of archaeological excavations; architectural plans of Classical and Medieval buildings are also given. Although all these monuments are covered, far greater attention is given to the city's Byzantine and Medieval churches, both outside and inside, including the mosaics for which they are justly famous."
5,Very Good Book!,"I really liked this book and it was written in great detail about the events that lead to the Battle of Britain. I guess I'm a little partial to the RAF and thought that the story could have been more about the airmen who served in the Royal Air Force. The only reason I didn't like the book is that it jumped around too much and never really focused on the Royal Air Force's other squadrons such as the Eagle Squadron. Don't get me wrong it's a great book, like I said earlier I'm a little partial to the RAF and would've like to hear more about the airmen because when people think about the Battle of Britain, that's the first thing that comes to mind."
4,"British Version of ""The Greatest Generation""","It seems our British friends decided to cash in on a good yank idea! This book is similar in style to Brokow's best seller except the characters are more intertwined with each other. They interact throughout the story which makes for a more comprehensive picture of the life and times of 1940 Great Britain. The backdrop of the governments'actions during the experiences of the various characters paints a broad and illuminating picture of the times.The only complaint I have is that it's not long enough to include many other facets of the British during their""Finest Hour"". I'll conclude by saying the ending is touching and surprising. Not your usual finale to a war history book."
3,Sadly overlooked,"This, the only Spirit album without Randy California, while not their best shouldn't be overlooked. There are a couple of clinkers (Mellow Morning especially) but the three John Locke songs and Chelsea Girls are as good as anything the band ever recorded and the ""bonus"" track helps flesh the album out a bit. If you're a Spirit fan give it a try. If you're new to Spirit don't make this your first but maybe come back to it after hearing the 1st four albums."
5,finally mighty fine,"Stateler bros GIVE SPIRIT AN EAR SHAKEN warmth [ THAT WAS UN RANDY KALIFORNIA ATTAINABLE BEFORE, locke KINDA IMERGES WITH DING DONG YHE WICKED WITCH IS DEAD CHEEKY CHEERINESS, TRANS MAURA, PSYCHO MYRA SUGARLOAFIAN, STONE ZONE, OZZ SMMMMMOG TRIPPINESS, FLASHES OF BRILLIANCE SORELLY LACKIN BEFORE, david briggs, legendary treatments sonic boom shake rattle and roll solid NAIL IN THE COFFIN EPIC BEST............."
5,Good book for beginners,I had not played poker for about 7 years before I bought this book. It was useful refresh my skills and would be excellent for anyone who has never played poker before.
3,parking sign,"I purchased this for my mother to give to another family member. She is in a nursing home and only home for the holiday. The sign arrived bent, repairable and not enough time to send it back. It was poorly packed thrown loosely in the bottom of a box with other items on top."
5,"a fast, fun read",I read this book in one sitting. Molly Shaw is an engaging heroine who gets herself into some silly situations. I laughed out loud at a few of the fixes she gets herself into. This is a very fun read. I'm looking forward to more from Melanie Craft.
3,A Little Over the Top for Me...,"This story line is fantastic, the actual story was a little of a let down.There were scenes I found a little unbelievable and some that could have been expanded. I found the way they came together was a little quick and unbelievable for such characters. I also felt the way they had their first sexual encounter was not true to character style.Over all it was a nice story, a good beach or weekend read without a whole lot of depth."
4,Margret Corben: America's First Heroine,"I thought this movie was very well researched and informative. I found the representations of the war very lively and graphic, it put me right there with them. The gripping comentary held me to my seat and would recommend this movie to anyone."
4,Corben,This movie was a good introduction to a little known individual of the American Revolution and would serve well in a classroom as such.
3,Useful reprint of a 1912 book,"For those interested in the Eastern Question (the breakup of the Ottoman Empire in the 19th and early 20th centuries) or in Norman Angellism, this is valuable background reading.It is important to note that it was originally published in 1912.Sir Norman Angell (1874-1967) won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1933."
5,A highly original book by an even more original voice.,"In a time when books are read then forgotten as easily as crisps at a cocktail party, at last there comes a tale to keep you thinking long after 'THE END'. Chock full of charming characters, interwoven with the skill of a master storyteller, The Twin is a book high on my list of recommendations. A stunning read."
5,Madden?? NAHHH!!!,"Madden......NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER BUY ANOTHA MADDEN GAME!!!If you are somewhat faintly interested in ANY sport youll love Sega's 2k series Baseball, Football, Basketball......Its all good!"
3,NFL 2K2...Maybe next year!!,"After playing this game I can say without a doubt that Madden 2002 is the best football game out there. This game is fun, but the graphics just don't match up with Madden 2002 for the PS2. Anyone who knows Football won't even talk about this game in the same breath as Madden. NFL2k is great for the DC, but it ends there. The graphics were choppy, slow and the stadiums actually look better on the DC, VC really dropped the ball on this one for the PS2. Whenever you hit somebody they go flying and the play goes supersonic for a second, whats the deal? No real tackles, and all I've heard is how hard and real the passing game is compared to Madden, but after 10 minutes of play, I had it mastered. This is a fun game, but for graphics and actual gameplay, it just doesn't match up with Madden. I gave it three stars only because this is a great game...for the DreamCast, but not on the PS2!"
3,NFL2k2 ........PS2 vs. Dreamcast,"I am a big fan of Sega Sports and I own NFL2k2 for the Dreamcast. But I must say I'm really disapointed in the PS2 version of my absolutely favorite game. First of all! Where is the online gameplay which was the reason why NFL2k2 fans play the game to begin with. Secondly, The graphics are 100 percent better on the dreamcast version than the supposidlly mighty PS2. There are flaws in the gameplay and the controlls are not comparible to the Dreamcast version. I say wait for the X-BOX version"
5,Better than Madden,"This is the best football game out there, it is easy to pickup yet so hard to master. It is graphically incredible. The graphics may no quite matchup to Madden, but there are far less jaggies. It may not have as great a running game as Madden, but the passing game blows Madden away!Don't buy Madden, buy this!"
2,Way too hard!!,"NFL 2k2 gets only two stars from me because of the difficulty. The game is way too hard on pro level. I mean you can't even beat the Carolina Panthers with the St. Louis Rams on pro level but on rookie level you can be the Rams and beat anybody by 50 points without even trying. What is the deal with the football games this year having to be so hard. I had Madden 2002 and it was very frustrating to play but this game makes me feel like throwing it in the garbage, which by the way I finally did do! I mean come on, why can't they make the pro games for PS2 as fun to play as NCAA football 2002. The computer is challenging but in a way where you don't feel like you'll never win a game. NCAA football 2002 is probably the best football game ever made in my opinion. EA sports and Sega sports should be ashamed for their pro football efforts this year. I hope Tecmo comes through with its rumored Tecmo Bowl for PS2. Maybe then everyone can get to play a real pro football game."
2,Strictly EA,"If your going to buy a football game, or any sport game for that matter, I would go strictly EA. Madden is much easier to control than NFL 2K2, and the commentary is 100% better. You could possibly argue that NFL 2K2 has more realism and better graphics, but why substitute enjoyment and control for a ""better looking game""? I would avoid NFL 2K2 and buy Madden for the same price."
5,Realism is key,This game is great for those who really knows football. Your play calling has to be right on in order to keep your drive going. Miss your defensive assignment and you'll be burnt for big yardage. Everything about this game makes football sense. The gameplay is great. The graphic is great. This one is for the real fans!!
1,Follow Up,"More problems - check out the animation of the ball on punts...check out the play-action plays, note the lack of hot routes and don't even think about finding plays for your TE...I can only hope that the VC team is bringing the juice on the PS2 version..."
2,Madden is best!,Grphically this game beats Madden in my mind. I gave it two stars but i do think it deserves 2 and a half. This game basically gets a bad rating from me because it has no depth whatsoever. The franchise mode blows.Like you can only have a one player franchise mode in madden you can have a 31 player franchise mode. I also hate the way they set up the players they dont separate the tackles from left/right tackles and separate FB's from HB's. And they dont even get the NFL rules right. For example i intercepted a pass in the endzone and was tackled and they called a safety well excuse me i think that is a touchback. Do not buy this game if you want to buy a football game buy Madden NFL it is better. This game could be btter with a better franchise mode and a few other changes but for now i still place Madden on top.
2,Horrible,OK so the graphoics are better and the music and commetary better. That is it. The franchise mode is horrible. No stats on trades. No player progession (keep a computer handy to record last years numbers) and the off season is a disoprganized mess. No one outbids me. The salary cap is the same What is the draft order? HOW OLD ARE THE PLAYERS? Can you believe there are no ages? How can you make a general manager decision without a guys age? No coach creation. No player or team creation in franchise. My point is that if you like franchise mode you will be disappointed and resent the fact you bought this garbage. I guess if you like the players being knocked ten feet on every tackle then this game is for you. Madden's is 100% better. I play half of the time as a general manger and the other I really play. In this game a 5 year old can be a general manager. No stats are given so no thought can be used.
1,step by step.....what was that again??,"Thats what the title says and hence i bought the book.Its not exactly step by step. The cards i liked didnt come with any instructions at all!Its very frustrating---because you can see the card but cannot make it.The directions (wherever you are lucky to find it)...are not very helpful also...for eg---there are drawings for the cut out but no dimensions...it didnt help me at all.I would recommend this book only if you are a accomplished paper engineer and can ""see"" the technique of making these cards"
3,Nice book but I was a bit disappointed,"This is a very nice book and has some great basic instructions; however, I bought the book strictly because I wanted the pattern and instructions for the dove featured on the cover. It wasn't included in the book, which seems strange to me: not including the complete pattern for your cover picture."
5,Great book!,"Ordered this book for a friend that is locked up and has limited supplies. He loves this book and stated it gave him great ideas and creativity. Customer service was great (as usual with Amazon.com), it arrived on time, great condition. Only problem; all companies dont put invoices in thier shipments. He cannot receive any books without the invoices. Why would a company ship ANYTHING without an invoice? However they do! My only complaint!"
3,About the book and and the contents.,"This book has pictures of projects that are not contained in the edition, such as the cover photo, among many others, that the schemes are not in the application, although it explains the principles used to make them. Beginners will want clear and precise guidelines about the most challenging applications. In this book lacked that. The schematic level is good, and the explanation of the contents are fairly simple, so that anyone can follow the process. Good impression. Unfortunately my book, despite being new, arrived in poor condition, with spotted leaves and bent."
5,Paul Jackson is a genius,"First, I was born without a genetic predeliction for anything that involved cutting paper; following written instructions for folding things; coloring maps,paperdolls etc., pasting; or, heaven forbid, having a clean looking product when I did finish. After 70 years of being mesmerized by pop-up books, I decided that if I started with children's books, I might just get something to work for me. It took time, lots of time, but I finally graduated from three tiered cakes amd simple 'v' cuts, to a grown up book. Other reviews convinced me that this author had a successful teaching method and after five prior books, I decided I was ready to test myself against Mr. Jackson's claim. After many, many, many, hours of working with his book, I finally mastered the free standing dove on the front of the book. I cried."
3,not bad,Nice book with lots of pictures. What it could use in my opinion is an explanation of the more complex or less common pop-up methods. Now I have to figure a lot out myself because it is not in the book.I'm not tatally satisfied with this book and will definately need another one to complete the pop-up book i'm making.
4,My first Pop-Up book,I became the shipment very quickly. The book is good for someone who never had make paper creations with pop-up techniques before.
3,Disappointing,"Some great ideas presented in the book;however,the instructions are not executed well to teach reader how to recreate the cards. There seems to be an over abundance of information on how to recreate pop-up heart cards which was very disappointing.You are better off borrowing from the library."
2,Another language,"The information in this book is like speaking another language-- you better be prepared to put in the time and energy to understand it and you still might fall on your face. Oh my goodness, this book hurt my head because it is completely foreign to anything I have ever done in card making. However, it did expand my knowledge and skills but I am still at a very low level as far as production; I have only mastered about half the book and I’ve had it for a while. Be prepared to use a lot of scrap paper in learning; my house is covered in lots of tiny folded pieces of paper and I’m eating more and more Chinese food these days ;) (this folding stuff is an Asian thing for sure, their brains just work this way!)"
3,Good for beginners,"This book contains great lessons for the basics of pop-ups. However, if you're looking for more challenging projects, this book is not for you. The book has professional examples for each type of tecnique, but fails to show how to make any of them. The gallery at the end of the book is very nice, but not if you want to make any of these designs, the patterns are not included. I was also very disappointed in the lack of more skillful projects. The whole design section with 38 different ways to make a heart card was not very useful. I'd rather be able to make one of the gallery cards than make any of the heart ones."
1,Poor Instructions!,"There are dozens and dozens of pictures showing what you could make with paper, pencil, and exacto knife, but the instructions were minimal and only for the simple projects. Beautiful examples are shown throughout the book, but no instructions on how to make them. Having patterns for the more intricate projects would definitely help out. It's an okay book to learn the basic, but lacking for advanced designs.The Title ""Step by Step Instructions"" is very misleading."
1,did not fulfill my needs; I returned the book,"I returned a popup book which didn't fulfill my needs. I received a full refund. I'm very happy with Amazon, and have bought mny thing over the years. Thanks for all you do."
3,The pop up Book,I found this book was very interesting and contributed to my understanding of the subjrct. I was able to utilise some info I gained.
1,Corvette Clock,When you buy cheap Chinese products its no surprise that they don't work. The first clock didn't work and the replacement din't work. I'm out $20.00 in shipping since these where a gift to my brother. You might actully see if a item functions before you sell it!!!
1,Not Good,This clock worked for about two days then quit. I could never get it to keep the proper time.I was really disappointed. I would not recommend this product.
3,Worked for less than a year,"Bought this clock for my Dad for Christmas last year and it worked for awhile - he loves the red light. But a year later, I am searching for a replacement for it - I am so bummed and so is he."
5,An excellent value for the money,"A very nice clock with bold and bright neon lights (clock works from a battery, lights are plugged in using the supplied transformer). When I purchased it the price was much less than similar units I saw elsewhere."
5,Again SONY,"It is light, seems very well, user friendly, has hard case.If you want to get with you a notebook during travels it is OK."
5,Yay new oil lines,"great price, fast shipping and above all they fit, which is probably most important due to bends in the line would buy them again but hope I don't have to."
4,Mini review,"The buckets were received promptly. However, they turned out to be smaller than what I needed. Would compare the size to that of a dixie cup. Tried to think of other uses, but returned them for larger buckets."
1,Window screen way too small,"This case is VERY lame. The window for the screen is so small you lose alot of the svreen, so if you watch any videos on your 60G ipod, you will have to take the case off to see the full picture, & you cannit see the full menus too. It's useless. It is not even snug, the ipod wobbles around in it too. I guess you get what you pay for. Don't waste your money, spend a few more bucks & get a better one."
1,CHEAP!!! CHEAP!!! CHEAP!!!,"DON'T PURCAHSE THIS COSTUME. IN THE PICTURE IT LOOKS NICE BUT IN PERSON IT LOOKS CHEAP. I BROUGHT THIS COSTUME FOR MY HUSBAND OF 2009 HALLOWEEN AND HE DIDN'T WANT TO WEAR IT BECAUSE IT LOOKED HORRIBLE. THE HAT CAME WRINKLED, THE PANTS WERE TOO SHORT AND TIGHT AND THE COLOR WASN'T BLUE BUT IT LOOKED LIKE A DIRTY GRAY COLOR."
1,Cheap,This is very cheap looking. It does not fit nice and the hat is HIDEOUS. It's just awful. Embarrassing is a great work to describe it.
5,Great Product,My daughter loves these. I thought they were going to be pink because of the picture. That was the only thing wrong. Everytime I put my daughter in her car seat she falls sleep. These are great!!!
2,Too rough,I had ordered pink and was surprised to see cream colored strap covers but I needed them so badly I decided to just use them. After one use I had to stop. The fabric they are made out of gave my baby a rash on each side of her face. It's just too course. They need to be covered by a softer material.
1,too big,These arrived and they were too big for the car seat and did not fit over the straps well. I would not recommend these.
1,did not like it,the product looks great but material is cheap.you get what you paid for.my 19 months old daughter torn it apart in a couple of days.... the thread was so easy to pull and so the cottons that was used was coming off.
3,Political Statement,I found this book interesting. I'm an amateur historian with great interest on the Civil War and the leaders from both sides. I originally bought this book looking for more information on the Biographay and beliefs of Jefferson Davis. It does provide some insight into who he was but REMEMBER WHEN READING the authors' state that it is a defense of Jefferson Davis and what he stood for. Therefore this book definately has a slant toward defending and sugar coating who Jefferson Davis was.The book is a defense of State Rights (and decentralized government) as opposed to a strong centralized government. Wether you support one idea or the other this book is definately worth reading to get a different point of view.For historical reading on Jefferson Davis read his own writings and speeches from his life and service to the United States and then the Confederate States.
5,Bought for an actress friend,"This was my second order Volume 2. The first was for me, and the second was for Lorna Gray, who was in several Three Stooges shorts (including ones on this disc). She was thrilled that the shorts are being digitally restored, and presented in order.Frank Reighter"
5,The strong years,"1937-1939 arguably had the finest Stooges shorts during their 25-year run. Important shorts are featured in this set, and if you only get one Stooges collection, this is it."
5,We can't help it. We're morons!,"Whereas Vol 1 started off a bit slow, Vol 2 starts off with the boys in top form. It's been great finally seeing these shorts in chronological order and being able to notice subtle and not so subtle changes, like the opening theme. The first 8 episodes in Vol 1 all had different opening songs before the verse portion of Listen to the Mockingbird became the official one. In late 1938 and early 1939 Mockingbird flip-flops with 3 Blind Mice before 3 Blind Mice becomes the main theme. I always preferred Mockingbird myself. As in Vol 1, the picture quality in Vol 2 is great. Vol 3 is also going to be a must have with A Plumbing We Will Go, You Nazti Spy and I'll Never Heil You Again. Keep `em coming Sony/Columbia."
5,Just about perfect - a great value,"These shorts have never looked or sounded as good as they do here and this translates into a much more enjoyable viewing experience. And you get 24 shorts for about 20 bucks - a stark contrast to the older Stooge DVDs which would have just 5 shorts for the same price. This period (37-39) arguably captures the Stooges at their best, but everyone has different opinions on that. If it's not their best period, almost everyone would agree it's one of them.Stooge fans and fans of classic comedy need to buy these so the remaining Stooges shorts get the same treatment. As long as these volumes sell well, we'll see more of them."
5,"If you like the Stooges, you'll love this!","I bought the first volume and now the second. I think that this is the best purchase you can make if you need a good laugh in the midst of this crazy life we all lead. The restoration and re-mastering of the video and audio make these very enjoyable and you feel as if you have a time capsule into the past. This collection also features some of the more memorable performances by Curly. The fact that Sony released these in chronological order means that there are no repeats or overlaps. So I hope Sony keeps on restoring and releasing these dubious masterpieces. If you want a good dose of the Stooges, buy this DVD, you won't regret it. Pick up volume one as well while you are at it. I did!"
5,Goof Balls,"I have volumn 1 and these are great. I will be getting all 4 of them. I like it by the years, 1937-1939."
5,1937-1939,"Volume Two: They JUST keep gettin' better...that is, until they, just, finally, get BESSER.Besser IS German for Better, and, it's aBETTER deal to just buy EVERYTHING foran exceptional bargain:The Three Stooges: The Ultimate Collection"
1,Disappointed,I was extremely disappointed in this necklace thinking I made a good purchase after reading the reviews. I thought it looked cheap and didn't care for the coil like feel. I wore it a few times and the necklace would always grab my hair around the clasp. I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this necklace.
4,Straight from Jimmy's Heart,"Out of all these reviews, one of my all time favorite Buffett songs keeps getting glanced over: ""Stranded on a Sand Bar"". Maybe it's because I love my boat as much as Jimmy loves his, but this song hits home every single time. This album contains several concert populars, but ""Stranded"" came from Jimmy's true island soul, and is reason enough to add this album to any collection. ""Survive"" too is full of meaning, with it's beautiful harmonic verses, enough to make you cry...I'd give anything to see Jimmy do these two songs live. And finally, ""Treat Her Like a Lady"", a sailor's song to his beloved ocean. Not unlike ""Brandy"" by Gordon Lightfoot.. a man in love with the sea can never leave her, and that's what I get out of Buffett. Classic Fingers Taylor for sure, that all PHans should own."
4,Buffett Blows Up,"Volcano is not as consistently strong as some of Jimmy Buffett's previous albums, but is a very enjoyable listen from beginning to end. The album was actually recorded in the tropics and the Caribbean vibe permeates the album. ""Fins"" is well known by anyone who has attended one of Mr. Buffett's concerts as it is a major audience participation number. Besides that, it is a great song that has an extremely catchy chorus. The title track is ripe with steel drums and a calypso sound but suffers just a bit from the extremely dated lyrics (example being a mention of Three Mile Island). ""Treat Her Like A Lady"" is strong number as is ""Chanson Pour Les Petits Enfants"". ""Boat Drinks"" is a fun song and finds Mr. Buffett at his tropical best while ""Dreamsicle"" is pleasant. Overall, Volcano has some great songs, but lacks consistency"
5,Simply great! A must own if you are a Buffett fan.,If you are a Parrot Head then you must have this CD in your collection! I highly recommend it!
4,For a small book it packs a bunch!,"If you are looking for a little boost to your everyday religous routine, then this is the book for you. Phil Vassar takes words from his own song ""THIS IS GOD"", and places them in a book that grabs at your heart! Short and sweet sentences that pull you back into the 'real' world of thinking and believing in GOD!I have truly read this book over and over again as it gives me hope that I too could be exactly who I want to be!"
1,Is someone still buying it? It is soon 10 years old!,"it was ok distro in 2001 but today? It has none of the drivers for todays computing, it is not even supported for last 5 years! Get Mandriva instead."
5,Illuminating is an understatement,"I bought this cd for my father, who is the ultimate EWF fan, for his birthday today (Happy B-day Daddy!!!)and I must say that I love this cd. Prior efforts by them have been quite mediocre, but this cd is a fusion of their old style with a bit of a new millennium twist. I must also say that I have become an EWF fan by-way-of my father, so I am honest in my assessment of this cd. If it were up to me, I would say it is Grammy-worthy!!! NO LIE!!!"
4,"Wish it was more like ""The Promise""","While I am enjoying the new CD, I only wish it was more Earth, Wind & Fire and not other people doing their version of them. There has never been another group like Earth, Wind & Fire and all of their 70s and 80s material prove this. No one can arrange the horn section like Maurice did back in the day. My favorite tracks... ""Pure Gold,"" and ""Love's Dance"" but for a better EW&F CD check out ""The Promise"" from 2003."
2,YUK,"This is very disappointing. Illumination does not even come close to their previous work. Buy it if you are a long time fan, but otherwise don't waste your time."
2,Momentum is so hard to maintain,"EWF is as good as it gets when performing live their timeless material. This anticipated album, however, is a big disappointment. They don't need the current ""artists"" except to reach a broader audience, but run the risk of losing the faithful. The ""artists"" featured won't stand the test of time and add nothing to this work.I wanted more of the kind of upbeat, melodic, rhythmic songs that are EWF. Let's hope they can find their groove once again."
2,very Bland,"if it wasn't for the fact that I grew up digging this Band then I'd spin this disc out of my window.aside from ""Pure Gold"" the rest of this Album is one big yearn fest. it's like hearing a Band just going through the Motions.Maurice White is back but mainly in appearence here&there.Philip Bailey ain't knocking me out no more.I miss the Horns,I Miss Larry Dunn,I miss Al Mckay,I Miss the Real Elements.this is like a Vegas Lounge Act impersonating a Band that I grew up digging. this is another so-so album&that is Being Kind."
2,Boring,Except for two songs near the end this CD is really slow and boring there is no energy anymore in these guys no fantastic horns or production. The Promise was just as Bad and I feel cheated form what was once a great group. I think these guys need to lock themselves in a studio with an awesome horn sectionand orchestra and really create like the did from All n All to Raise. Make one more enrgetic effort and call it a career. I am tired of Ballads and can't stand all the other people on this CD taking up good Baily or White vocal time.
1,Outrage!!!,I don't get how one member of a group can retain the rights to use their name and put out albums that don't live up to the legacy of their former greatness. I saw these guys on tour in Portland and their performance was shameful.There were people in the audience who thought they were seeing EWF -- and were at a loss as to what the fuss was all about.Don't tarnish what was great with inferior product. If you're going to make new records call yourselves something else.
1,3...,"...half-decent tracks don't make an album: ""Pure Gold"", ""Show Me The Way"" & ""To You"". The rest sounds like OutKast or Black Eyed Peas (of s**t). Some clowns from aforementioned groups are even on the album!(?).Well, the album probably could get 4-5 stars...if your under 14!!!Oh well, EW&F;'s collaborations has NEVER been successful through the years, not this time either.If you by any chance are interested in the REAL EW&F;, check out ""I Am"" or ""Raise!"" etc., these albums get my 5 stars..."
3,I am trying to like this cd,"I am a huge EWF fan and have been since I was a child. I have always viewed them as the best band period but this cd is mediocre at best. I wish EWF would stick to what they do best - R & B. Illumination is sprinkled with hip hop that just does not work for me. I am not opposed to collaborations but some of these fail. There are some classic EWF rhythms, beats and touches and I like those songs best.It feels like they were trying to appeal to the youngsters, but perhaps they should continue appealing to their loyal fans."
2,EWF tries to attract a younger audience and fails,"I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE EWF. However, this attempt to pull in younger fans (age 20-30) doesn't come together well at all!! The best song on this CD is the ""Show Me the Way"" which is produced by Raphael Saddiq. Thank goodness I spent less than $5."
3,Style over substance,"First I'd like to say that EWF is one of my favorite groups. This Cd falls short, however. It has all the elements we've comed to love on the surface, but it rarely goes any deeper than that. Some of the horn licks and harmnonies are there, but that's as deep as it goes. I listened to this CD twice back to back last night and it got less impressive the second time around. One of the things that made me a fan of EWF was that I could listen over and over again a find new things to be interested in.As far as the earlier reviewer, What could I be listening to 20 years from now? Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock if he's around he'll be in his 80's."
2,not for the funk lovers but if you like ballads,I'm into funk and I like ewf back when they was more experimental I prefer anything they made befiore they went pop disco.
2,"Not Your Father's Earth, Wind & Fire...","...and I'm the father. The day before my 13-year old daughter and I were to see an excellent concert by EWF, I bought this album. After listening to about the first five tracks, my daughter turned to me and said, ""There's not much Earth, Wind & Fire on this CD, is there?"" Sadly, there isn't. If you're looking for Earth, Wind & Fire, you won't find much of it here. Thankfully, the band played nothing from this album the following night! So if you get a chance, see them live! If not, buy Spirit, All 'N All, I Am, Faces, Touch the World, Raise, or any number of other worthy efforts, but avoid this one."
4,"The Dance of Connection: How to Talk to Someone When You're Mad, Hurt, Scared, Frustrated, Insulted, Betrayed or Desperate (","When I bought this book I was Mad, Frustrated and Desperate to find a solution on how to connect with co-workers and family. Listening to it while traveling back and forth to work helped me with methods to approach co-workers. There was one section that I truly felt she was telling my story and the end result was a confirmation that the problem is not always me but the other person of which I have no control. The connection is knowing what or who you have control over. I found the book easy to listen to and re-affirming that connecting was possible when taking the correct approach to others."
4,Not exactly what I thought it would be...,"This book is very well written and down to earth, but I thought that it would give more substantial ideas on how to fight fairly and communicate well with your partner and/or family. Instead it was much more general in discussing relationships.Still, it certainly made me think about how I relate to the people in my life."
2,Read by Author,I think the information in the book was overshadowed by the reading. I wish all writers would realize how important a professional reader is to an audio book listener. I am going to buy a hard copy.
1,Huge disappointment not worth $$,"The dance of connection-- By: Harriet LernerThis is the second book I have tried to read from Harriet. The last one I was able to read, but found myself jumping through huge chunks that were useless to me. In this book though I found that I couldn't even get into her writing. Also, I found myself jumping huge chunks again. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!For an author whose books all say how she is, ""One of the nation's most loved and respected relationship experts"" her writing style isn't engaging at all.It's written very clearly but not at a therapeutic level, more so any lay person can understand.I personally wouldn't recommend anyone to this book so I give it 1/5. It could help some people who don't know much already but it's not for an advanced reader of psychology.P"
1,Very Dissapointing,"The title of this book is very intriguing and the subject of learning how to improve communication skills when things are rough is very compelling. I was astonished and very dissapointed with the author's approach - so much so, that I was not able to make it past page 35. I would not have made the expenditure had I known that the author created a platform for her philosophy of relationships. Had that been my interest at the time, there are far more interesting treatises on the subject. I rate this book as a 1 because there isn't a lower number."
2,"Not enough techniques given, too much storytelling","I was disappointed in this book. I expected to get specific cognitive behavioral techniques to change the way I react/talk when I am upset. Instead I got a bunch of stories about patients, and a bunch of stories about the author and her husband (which especially got old and are not helpful for those of us who are lonely and don't have that kind of love in our lives). Overall I didn't get too much from this book, I'm sad to say. I think I need more direct instruction rather than stories to try to illustrate things. It just wasn't for me."
2,Too much story telling,"This book was recommended for me to read by my husband's personal therapist. He's in anger counseling, after coming back from Iraq, and I'm the one reading about six books right now.While it was worth the read, I need MORE: More instruction, more direction. More getting to the point! Lerner goes on and on and I found myself bored with the stories. I'm reading for answers. There are so many stories and you really have to hunt for clues as to WHAT TO DO IN YOUR OWN LIFE. If you're reading a self-help book, then obviously you just may need some help now. And fishing for ""what to do"" isn't productive.I just didn't like the flowy, story telling way of writing. To me, she spent a lot of time writing the history of a problematic relationship and then what the patient WANTED to achieve and then not so much as to what was needed to fix the problem for a positive outcome. Too many times I read the phrase, ""we'll get to that later."""
3,worth a read,"Looks like there are mixed reviews for this book. Well, it's all a matter of what you happen to be looking for. If you are expecting an instruction manual...if you want to learn techniques, this really isn't your book. This is more like a pleasurable essay, a well-written, good read, with some gems in terms of psychological insights that you may take with you beyond the reading of the book. Finding and/or getting clear about your voice is a theme in this book. It has the feeling of a conversation with a friend, and I find it admirable -- and I think it will be helpful to many readers -- that the author was willing and able to share her own life experiences as she did."
4,It's good but ...,"I've compared this generic bag with the Eureka OEM bag. Here are what I found:1) the OEM bag is measured 23""L x 8""D x 6""W whereas the generic bag is measured 21""L x 7""D x 6""W. The ""total"" volume for the generic bag is, therefore, 20% less than the OEM's. 2) The maximum usable volume as recommended by the dust bag manufacturer for the OEM bag is 15""x8""x6"" (there is a maximum line drawn on the bag) whereas for the generic bag it is 13""x7""x6"". Therefore, the usable volume for the generic bag is approximately 25% less than the OEM's. 3)The bag materials look similar. 4) The fit of the generic bag to my vacuum cleaner is fine. 5) The price of the generic bag is very good."
1,No Passion Here,"No, No, No, Absolutely AWFUL. I am a huge fan of Passion and it is my favourite Sondheim score. Please do not waste your money on this garbage. Maria Friedman is terrible and after listening to her ridiculous over acting I am happy to throw this CD in the bin. NO feeling, NO Passion. I would give this no stars if I could."
3,Fawcett City Companion,"Book provides a great deal of information on the people who worked at Fawcett Comics, but little information on the characters they created."
1,Not worth the $$,"The recordings are too short (longest is about 20 minutes) and the language used is not calming...strange phrasings and clinical words like ""data"" don't help you to relax. Find another meditation CD because this is not the one."
5,A Remarkable Product,"This book was written by a third party with no connection at all to the product being reviewed. CAW water aka Willard Water is one of the most fascinating discoveries I've ever used...as Dr. Willard says many times in the book; it's a serendipitous discovery.I've used this for cleaning, drinking, healing, & find it amazing. I encourage you to buy some of the water after buying the book & try it for yourselves.Just one of the many things it does: it heals injuries without scar tissue forming; & takes away the pain to boot! I tore my palm open with the claw part of a hammer...ouch! I decided to to put it to the test so all I used on this gash was the water 'till it healed. Other than a slight discoloration, there is no evidence of the gash.The book is well written & informative."
2,Disappointing,I purchased this CD for help during my labor and delivery and because of the one good review here on Amazon. I was expecting a CD with relaxation techniques and relaxing music (like what you hear while getting a massage).. this CD has a woman speaking through it with just about the same music on all tracks.. I feel like I've been taken considering the $18.99 price tag with only 6 tracks.
1,"If i could take one star away, I would.","This was the ABSOLUTE worst thing I've everbought online! I mean really horrible, the imagery was short, very nondescriptive. The speaker doesn't walk you into reaxation, so its hard to focus. I got better reults for free, from a script my yoga instructor wrote, that my husband read allowed."
5,A very good Tour de Force of Anglican Theology,"Aidan Nichols does an excellent job of provding one of the few historical theologies of Anglicanism. Anglicanism becomes a dizzying array of complexities as it progresses from the Reformation era to the present. Nichols does a fine job of portraying this complex portrait of Anglicanism fairly even though he himself is Roman Catholic. I enjoyed the work immensely but was surprised to find Nichols relied primarily on secondary sources. That said, this is one of the best historical introductions to Anglicanism out there."
4,A Serious Mind Trip,"I'm not sure I have the words to describe this book. In terms of art, it's sheer genius. In terms of story, it's a bit contrived, but entertaining nonetheless. If you are a fan of truly inspired comic artwork and like your comics trippy, buy this book. If you live the world of typical superheroes and would like to stay there, don't go anywhere near Elektra: Assassin. Sign me up for the Dark Knight Strikes Again."
4,Good: Cocky and Strange,"Hunter/Steadman inflected treatment of Nixon's 21st century sick-media America being invaded by a resurrected muse/ninja/cyborg/palimpsest killer in a long red thong. Her character is conflicted and messy-weird but the story is that of another man, a proto-macho cigar-chomping positive-slant on the good-old-American-rebel guy. The art is a treat, the story is cocky and strange. Good comic."
1,a quality print is hard to find,"Digiview is terrible quality concerning this DVD. Don't waste your time. Although none of the prints are pristine, I prefer the Platinum prints. These were good ol' Roy and Gabby movies."
2,Calling all amatuers!,"This book is great- if you happen to be a 4- year-old! No offense, but Simpson's crude drawing style is a discrace to cartoonists everywhere. I must say, however, that it's not all bad.There is a small amount of usefull knowlege, like thinking up ideas for comic strips. I recommend The Cartoonist's Workbook by Robin Hall.If you're a beginner, The Cartoonist's Bible is OK."
2,for collectors,"While this book has some value in that it teaches the basics competently, there is nothing here that can't be gotten from other books with equal competence and better examples. Intro books by Randy Glasbergen, Mark Heath, Robin Hall, Christopher Hart, Roger Armstrong, Duane Barnhart, Bruce Blitz, Al Bohl, etc., are all equally valuable as instruction (if not more so), and they provide finer examples of what cartooning can look like. Even though this book has useful info for the beginner, I'd still recommend that a beginner start with one of those other ones first, and check this one out later if you're still hungry for anything you haven't already read. (Or if you collect cartooning books and need to have them all...)"
4,Nice toy - but where is Katara?,This is a very nice Aang figure. He comes with his glider and Momo the lemur. My only complaint isn't about this particular toy but the lack of ANY female characters from the show. Katara is one of the main characters and the narrator of the show - she doesn't get a figure? Both my son and my daughter have been asking for her.
5,Avatar Airbending Aang,"My 3.5 year old has really enjoyed the Avatar Airbending Aang. The toy is very realistic looking, and the arms and legs move. Of note, the ""stick"" accessory the comes with the toy is not appropriate for little kids."
4,Sacred Voices reminds us of the sacred women who came before,"This book reminds us of what we do not know, what we miss in our tradition--the voice of the women who came before us. The sacred voices are there, and Sherri has listened. She brings us into the possible thoughts and feelings of our matriarchs. She reminds us of the important roles played by these women who are silent in the Bible and/or who are not fully explained in commentary. This book is great to read aloud, to share with women friends, the men in our lives, and children, as it sparks discussion and debate."
3,Backlight died after two months... cute watch though,"This watch is really cute and matches everything. It does slide down my wrist though and I don't even have small wrists! I got this watch two months ago, and the backlight quit the other day. The watch is still ticking along, so I'm not going to bother to return it, but a feature like that should work for more than two months. :["
2,Doesn't keep time,"My wife has had this watch for 3/4 of a year. It looks great and she really likes it, except for the fact that it won't keep accurate time.It started losing time a couple of months after she got it. She had the battery replaced, and it kept time for a little while, then started losing time again. Today she missed an appointment because it was 20 minutes slow. We'll try changing the battery again, but all in all it seems as if something is really wrong with this watch."
5,Stylish and feminine,"I have very narrow wrists, so most watches look way too bulky on me. This one is classy and feminine, not too big. I have had a Timex watch before that the battery life was excellent on and I trust that it will be the case with this one also. My skin is very sensitive to metal alloys like nickel and copper, so I was careful to buy a watch that stated that both the bracelet and the back of the plate were made of stainless steel and I have not had any problems with irritation or allergic reaction with it whatsoever."
4,Timex Women's Classic Indiglo Two-Tone Expansion Band Watch,"This Timex Watch is beautiful. It is a nice combination as a useful and practical watch and still looks dressy and can be worn for evening. I was looking for a watch that had a face that lighted up but I failed to see that it did not have the date on the face. This would be the only negative point for me. If this is not important to you, it is a perfect watch."
1,band adjustment,"I e-mailed Timex...their answer? ""Expansion links are not designed to be removed"" Degree of difficulty if you decide to remove the links..8 out of 10. In other words, don't buy this watch if you have a small wrist!"
4,Nice everyday watch,"This watch was exactly what I needed; as a college student who also works part time, I needed something that was classic and simple that could go from class to work and back again. The face is very easy to read, and I love the light-up function.I knocked it down a star because it fits slightly large on my wrist. It is an elastic band, and that means the face slides a little over my wrist; not enough to flip completely under it, but enough to go annoyingly to one side or the other. This may fit better on other people; I'm a tall girl, but I have small wrists for my size.I like the dual-tone of gold and silver on it. It goes with pretty much everything I own, and has held up great so far!"
4,I like it!,I like the watch. It fills my need very well. I like the expansion band and also the bi-color aspect of the watch and band.It seems to keep time accurately.
5,spellbinding chanteuse,"Careful as you descend the stairs to that dim lit bistro in Rio or Paris. Inside you see a cherubic petite woman and her Japanese jazz guitar player as Camila casts a spell over you. A marvelous caberate singer, using synthesizer backround brilliantly, you will love the potions of Bossa Nova, jazzy rhythm and blusey jazz. Passionate,rockin' and lovely all in one performance. Terrific!"
5,Great book for intermediate computer users,This book will not boar you with introductory lessons on how to use wordpad and other utilities you learned with Windows 95. This book jumps right in and explains how the architecture of NT differs from windows. Very readable
1,A waste of paper => trees!,"I really didn't like it. I'm a newbie & I didn't find key concepts or advices for planning or installing NT (unleashed?!), but things I could see by myself. Sorry."
2,"Wish I could find this bit with a 1/2"" shank","I was excited after recieving this speciaty bit and was eager to try it out. I quickly grabben a sizable scrap of 3/8"" inch acrylic and headed for the router table. After installing the bit I started making a test cut and hit a small bind about 1"" into the cut and before I could reach for the off switch the bit snapped in two. My work piece was secured and did not kickback or come off the fence. My opinion is this bit is too weak or was defective."
5,Incisive Classic Music-Making!,"Without repeating the raves for the Prokofiev, I must add how very very impressive Mullova and Anderszewski are in the Debussy. What a grand sweeping performance, calling to mind the titans of many years ago in its command, drive, and passion. This must be heard! As Santa Fe correctly points out, Mullova sounds far more at home in the moderns, and she plays far more passionately here than she does in her forays into Mozart, and while that probably is proper, the point is that she really goes to town in the moderns. The recording stage of the Janacek and the Debussy sonatas, from 1995, is better than the Prokofief by a bit - but this is all together just one super set.If you haven't any examples of Mullova in modern music you're missing out!Highest recommendation!"
1,Absent Results,"It did nothing for me, maybe it helped others. I however did not receive any results. Back to the drawing board is on notice."
1,flight of the phoenix,the Marco Beltrami version of this soundtrack is NOT the movie's actual soundtrack. the original starts with a Johnny Cash song.
1,Not one of Beltrami's best.,"2004 was a stellar year for Beltrami. His scores for ""Hellboy"" and ""I, Robot"" are among my favorites, but then there's this turkey. I bought the score before seeing the movie simply because of the composer's other works, but it seemed clear to me that he got no inspiration from the movie. I didn't see the film until it hit DVD, and I found it extremely boring. Beltrami must have felt the same way. The music is uninspired and monotonous, with no memorable themes or motifs. Much like the movie, the music is deadly dull."
2,Where's Gimme Some Lovin?,As bizzare as it is where's Steve Winwood's/ Spencer Davis Group Gimme Some Lovin remix that runs at the beginning of the credits. Somebody must have loved that tracks becuase it is soooo out of place. Great version... this one song is it's better than this emotionally overdone movie.
2,song I like is not on soundtrack,In the movie there was a song played when they were working on the plane. I was disappointed to find out it is not on the soundtrack. I am trying to find out what the song is titled.
5,Excellent Grooves from local favorties,I've seen these guys at least at a half dozen clubs and venues around Metro Detroit. they put on a good show and bandmate Dan Augustine can often be found DJ'ing elsewhere at other clubs too.I must of listened to their first CD Game Program a million times and Libra Action was a great sequel.I am looking forward to more by these guys!Hey Dan! It's your old Trader Pal!
3,Ehh... comes up short,"Although the interworkings of the Pentagon are an intriguing subject these days, I found this book to be somewhat dissapointing. The analysis is somewhat skimpy with only broad associations drawing together all of the evidence. Provides a glimpse into Rumsfeld's leadership style, and how people inside the Pentagon have reacted to it, but not very thorough. Sometimes I got the impression that the book's purpose was simply to show off how much sexy classified stuff the author could find, and not all of it backed up the books thesis, which I THINK is that Rummy is the right leader at the right time. Recommend Plan of Attack instead because it is more thorough and broad."
1,Propaganda,"From the muddled musings of Rowan Scarborough one would close this book ""safe in the knowledge"" that Mr Rumsfeld is a noble and intelligent man and not the oil sipping lunatic that he really is."
1,Whitewash,"As a right winger I still deplore any book on Rumsfeld that fails to point out that he was responsible for providing Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction in the 80's AND that he opened diplomatic relations between Saddam and the US in the late 70's, that Saddam was a close pal with whom he brokered countless arms deals - and that Rumsfeld had full knowledge (if not approval) of Saddam gassing the Kurds - this is quite simply a pathetic whitewash. Rumsfeld is an evil hypocrite - : like Kissinger he doesn' dare step foot in Europe lest he be prosecuted as a war criminal. Very poor book."
5,Star Trek's Trivial Pursuit,"I had been waiting for Star Trek Trivial Pursuit to come out but I wasn't holding my breath. This game is a suitable alternative. It is appropriate for newer and more seasoned Trekkies and Trekkers. You can even play with someone who knows a lot more or a lot less than you do about Star Trek. The game comes in a nice tin with a plastic insert to keep the cards and pieces organized. The questions cover Original Series, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, and Voyager. The rules are a bit complicated, especially the first time, but you can easily make up several variations. Each question is in a multiple choice format, but you can also play without the choices if you're up for a challenge. The only problem with the cards is that you can't read the multiple choices and guess yourself because the correct answer is in bold. This game is a wonderful and fun trivia game that will provide countless hours of fun."
2,This book sucks.,"Yes, it would be accurate to say that this book doesn't do a very good job explaining things, that there are homework problems that as questions about concepts not covered in the book, and that some of the answers in the back are incorrect; however, when I say ""sucks"" I mean that it's not very well made. Two weeks into class, pages started falling out of this NEW book.More than likely you don't have a choice about what textbooks your class needs - but in this case, two suggestions: 1. Buy the solutions manual (because this book sucks). 2. Buy the hardcover version of this book (because this book sucks)."
2,Poor book,"This is a bad textbook for this subject. I had to buy it because of a class. Perfect condition, and arrived within a week using standard shipping."
2,Not for a beginner,I needed to take this course for the CS program at my university. It sucks for someone that doesnt know anything about the subject. It doesnt go into enough detail to explain the steps needed to solve the problems. You only have answers for odd questions and they dont have the steps on how they got that answer.The subject is not hard to understand if you have taken a college level algebra class. But book could go into more detail in showing all steps and also provide more examples of each concept.
5,Naruto Shippuden S1 E1,"If your a fan of Naruto, this episode is great. My kids and I have been waiting to view the continuation of the series after the original. At this time, apparently, we have to pay for viewing, so it will be along time before we finish, but I am glad that we now have access to it without purchasing the dvd's, although, that would be great, too!"
5,David always does the best work....,"This cd, although only eight songs, is great. As the band have explained it correlates the green cd, which is the ep from ""Can You Hear Us?"" and the yellow cd, which is the ep from ""Illuminate."" This cd is great, filled with the word of truth and creative, just as David always is. Hope you get it, I recommend it."
3,"Great songs, but some flaws","I had listened to some tracks of this CD on Pandora and decided that I really enjoyed the songs. After receiving the CD, I can say that I thoroughly enjoy worshiping along with the CD. Even though it's small, it has a nice variety of songs. David Crowder Band's style with the added sounds puts a little extra flair on the CD, which I really like.I am severely disappointed in the amount of dynamic range compression and clipping on this CD. On Pandora, it said the track was live, which was another I bought the CD as live tracks typically are better in this aspect. It seems to be live, but they appear to have modified it in the studio and raised the volume on it. Call me a music purist, but I really dislike buying a CD, especially a live CD, and finding this on it. For this reason, I cannot give it above 3 stars.Overall, however, I would still recommend the CD. It's rather enjoyable!"
4,GREAT!,"This cd is truly amazing. I really like DCB's versions of ""Every Move I Make"" and ""Undignified"". My only real annoyance with this cd (and DCB in general) is the overuse of ""scratching"", especially on the first track. It's not only unnecessary, it's annoying and adds nothing to the song."
2,So-so,"The case was cracked and ended up having to switch it out since there was an address label on the front. That was my only dislike on the item, but looking forward to hearing some great music!"
2,Like the removable insert,"Initially I thought this was going to be a great product to carry my chef's tools around in and it is nice to have the wheels, but the zipper has broken and it is heavier than I expected. The one nice thing about it is that it has a removable insert, like a slim briefcase, that I can and do still use although it limits me to what I can carry."
2,Do you like acronyms?,"Well I finished the Trilogy.Having heard him on the Coast To Coast radio show the author sounded very interesting.I couldn't wait to read about his out of body journeys and what the non-physical universe looks like and what the beings there are like etc.Sorry Charlie..none of that anywhere.A ton of acronyms and I can tell you that I kept skimming over large chunks of each book looking for something I could sink my teeth into.Maybe it is just me.I wanted some humanity here, something, anything about his EXPERIENCES.Sorry but it is just not for me."
4,Over indulgent in places,"""Little Movements"" (1980) is NOT smooth jazz and makes a nice companion to ""Silent Feet"" (1978). It is much, much better than ""Yellow Fields"" (1975) but not quite as good as ""Colours of Chloe"" (1974) and ""Silent Feet"" which are outstanding examples of Weber's artistry. The only instrumental I did not like on this album was the title track, ""Little Movements"", which I found to be seven and a half minutes of over indulgent noise making. Most of the time I love Weber and his Colours band so I can give them the benefit of the doubt this time around. Please see my other Eberhard Weber reviews!"
5,Reaches well beyond fans of the genre,"I doubt if they read this, they would even take much obsession to the word 'genre' or their place within its respective limits - rather simply declaring that they 'do what they do', and whatever that may be, they should really keep doing it.Every song sticks to the insides of your mind like glue in a very fantastic and enlightening way. I, myself not a fan at all of the usual screamo tunes, sometimes going as far as dismissing them completely of any musical talent, find solace in Terminal.They aren't trying to be something they are not, and it really pays.In short: The lyrics very mature especially ascending from such ranks, and the musical talent makes for unsurmountable future success. There isn't at least one song on here that won't leave you coming back.I dare you to listen to the samples and not be tempted to buy this album."
5,Hold you through the dark tonight....,"My band played with these guys when they were Letter Twelve, they played our first show and our last show ever. We've known them so long and I have to say, they've come a hell of a long way! This cd is a beautiful mix of songs. It has something for everyone. My fav tracks are Foster, City By the Sea, Dark, and Pillow Fighting, but I love all the tracks. I can't wait to see them again this Saturday. I hope you all get into this cd, cuz it is just kick a**."
4,A good CD,"It was a while before a finally got this CD but boy am i glad i got it. I love all the songs except the last one because his voice sounds kinda messed up. My fav tracks are 1,2,7, and 11. Buy this CD... you'll be glad you did."
4,Fit for a 4 y/o,The size of the figure is perfect my son thinks manbat is the coolest! My only issue is his wing pulled out as soon as my son tried to even stretch it out a little. Now when we put it back in place it doesnt stay that well. This happened 2 minutes after we took it out of the box...Perfect for the younger Batman enthusiast
5,NEW AUTHOR - EXCELLENT,"This is the first book that I have read by Melanie Craft and I was very impressed. Her use of animals in this book is very touching and the human characters are fascinating. There is humor, love, and mystery - all necessary ingredients in a good book. It is a fun read that I would highly recommend it. The fact that the royalties from this book go to the Mercer Clinic (provides free veterinary care to the companion animals of the homeless) is admirable. I look forward to more books from this author."
3,My neck must be too long or something.....,"Wish it was a little longer in the neck.I wear this on motorbike when colder than 45*. Neck is a little drafty because I'm not wearing turtleneck.I wear this skiing when 20* or colder. Neck is fine because I'm wearing turtleneck.Fabric is warm enough for both, yet thin enough to get under the helmets worn in both activities.Also, shows too much face when committing crimes."
5,Rock IT,I love this cable!!!! It is nice and long. I do wish they offered it in more colors. Go Daisy Rock <3
4,Callin all female guitar players!!!,"Ok. So, I am an adult. And I am a female. And I play guitar. Is it really so much to ask that the guitar industry make something a little feminine that isn't cheesy or incredibly juvenile? That being said, I love this cable. It screams that it belongs to the chick in the band. It seems to be really well made and I love the hot pink and black pattern. It isn't as heavy or thick as our other guitar cables but it may be because they are covered with rubber. It does the job just as well and it gives just that subtle extra ""gal"" touch that my gender neutral guitars need. Buy it! You won't regret it!"
3,"Well, three and a half stars actually...","Along with the wonderful, now-available live set ""Stand in the Fire"", we now have the two missing Asylum Zevon albums. While ""Envoy"" is marred by a few weak tracks, the strong ones more than make up for them.This, Zevon's final release for Asylum records scores with the title track, still ringing as true today as back in 1982, the chilling ""Charlie's Medicine"" and the biting ""Hula-Hula Boys"", and the album's original closer ""Never Too Late For Love"".The bonus tracks are a bit disappointing, ""Word of mouth"", while moody, features a badly dated-sounding keyboard (DX7?) which ruins it for me. An alt version of ""Let Nothing..."" which was never a stong track for me, is pleasant. ""The Risk"" shows promise but needs work and the ""Wild Thing"" jam is fun but hardly essential.Like the reviewer below stated, this in no way detracts from the original release. Well worth you time and money."
5,Zevon's Lost classic,"Originally released in 1982, Zevon's third album was one of his best releases, arguably his zenith. On the whole, the tone of the album is surprisingly light hearted (""The Hula Hula Boys"") and optimistic (""Never Too Late for Love""). It also contains some of Zevon's most direct and unflinching looks at his substance abuse issues (""Ain't That Pretty at All"" and the incredible ""Charlie's Medicine"").While many of the tracks from this release have dribbled out on various compilations over the years, somehow this great album has been unavailable on CD until now. This imported version is indeed pricey, but the sound quality is great and the packaging is wonderful, completely recreating (albeit in miniature) the original LP packaging. Worth it? You'll have to decide for yourself, but as someone who's been waiting at least 15 years to get this on CD, I'm happy with my purchase."
4,"Great patterns, very good descriptions","This book contains advanced patterns for the Marudai, using 4, 8 and 16 tamas (bobins). Once you understand that the kumihimos in the pictures are described at the end of the book you're good to go. The patterns let you see how the colors will affect the results and plan ahead to get the effect you desire.One thing I regret though is that the chapter on endings doesn't have enough details and would need more drawings.Highly recommended for intermediate level. If you are a complete beginner you should buy ""The Beginner's Guide to Braiding: The Craft of Kumihimo by Jacqui Carey"" first."
5,Indispensable,"If you are any sort of kumihimo enthusiast and you've worked your way through her first book, you need to add this to your library. Teaches the physics of kumi braids as well as many patterns. Easily adaptable to the foam disk if you don't use a maurudai."
4,bright pictures,"My Grand daughter loves the Lion King and watches it ""all"" the time. So I purchased the book so she could enjoy the story as read and look at ""Simba"" all the time..she is 2 yr :)"
2,My daughter loves it BUT,My daughter loves the pictures and me telling her the story of the Lion King. I use the word 'telling' very specifically because the written text is dreadful - the written story does not flow at all and the text used is not very good at all.If I was able to purchase (at a reasonable price) I would buy the Ladybird edition.
5,"""BEAUTIFUL""","To coincide with the Blu Ray release of ""The Lion King"" Disney released this wonderful hardcover book based on the movie. The story tells the story of how Simba became the Lion King after the tragic death of his father whom he loved more than anything in the world.The story, like the film, was really the first animated movie to address the death of a loved one from the child's perspective and it is heart warming, heart felt and touching.The pictures are taken from film stills from the movie.An A+ book and not just for children but for all who enjoy this timeless classic."
3,not great for the littlest kids,"Of course this is a great story- but this abridged version doesnt quite flow if you dont already know the story.The language is also a little 'old'. I have to censor it a bit for my 3 year old. The Disney pictures however are great, and if you have the energy to 'tell' the story rather than 'read' it then this works great."
3,Interesting,"Whether you enjoy this novel really all depends on your taste of books. If you're the one for sci-fi or adventure, this book is a little slow moving. However, if you like crime mysteries, this one is for you. Set in the small country town of Jericho, the Marriot family's life in fairly uneventful. That is, until a gold-miner who was recently seen around the area dies by mysterious means. The concern of the town is that, there are claims that he had two children around with him at the time. Their whereabouts is unknown. The story's ability to mix trivial events along with the highlights is extremely clever."
4,Another excellent novel by Gary Crew,"The book is written from the perspective of Kim, a young boy living in the country town of Jerico near the 'Angel's Gate'. His mother a nurse and receptionist in his father's surgery and Julia his older sister. Jerico is a relatively non-eventful place, until a man dies under mysterious circumstances in the surrounding mountains beyond Angel's Gate. 'Strange Objects' remains my favourite of Crew's books, but this ranks up there with the best of them. His vivid portrayals of the Australian landscape, amoung other things, adds to the quality of the novel. Definately worth the effort!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"While looking for a new PC, I was very attracted by the price/features of this laptop. After purchasing it, I immediately noticed that the bottom of the machine would get extremely hot after the computer has been on for some time. It gets so hot that it is uncomfortable to have in your lap, kind of defying the name of this product. Also, the touch-pad is very stick and difficult to navigate compared to every other laptop I've ever had. In addition, the DVD-Rom, stopped reading disks after about three months (this appeas to be a common issue). All in all, I do not rate this product highly at all. If Averatec's other goods are anything like this computer, I sincerely hope that this company will dissapear off the face of the earth sometime soon."
3,some useful info,it is more useful for alot of smuggling but isn't as good as pirates and privateers
2,"Another collection of ""kewl"" sites posing as a design book.","I am constantly amazed by the growing number of books being released on the subject of Web design. From first blush it would appear that the authors have the necessary credentials to pass on much need design help to up and comming web designers. But after delving deeper into the book you will find that the content revolves mainly around the ""oohhing and aahhing"" of high profile sites such as PowerBar and LandRover.The title purports to provide the reader with design secrets of producing ""killer interactive web sites""... There are 6 chapters and 2 appendicies (total of 211 pages). Chapter 4 is the chapter dealing with ""interactive"" sites and is less than 37 pages long. This book needs MORE meat and less GLITZ!"
4,Web design explained from scratch,"Many books focus on HTML techniques, others in color management, others in navigation... this one focus on work - how is it done. If you are about to create a new web design agency (like me) then man - this one gets it right! It doesn't get all 5 stars because it's a bit old and its companion web site is gone."
1,Didn't follow through with promise of companion website.,This book constantly refers to scripts available at their companion website. At the website all you will find is an inadequate excuse for why the scripts aren't there. Without the scripts the book is nothing more than useless theory that can't be put into practice.Save your money and buy a book that includes a companion CD-ROM rather than empty promises of a companion website.
3,"Not to be confused with ""Creating Killer Web Sites.""","For the record... As the author of ""Creating Killer Web Sites,"" I'vebeen asked if I had anything to do with thisbook. I did not. I am sorry for the confusion with the titles -- it's our publishers' decision. Titles are not protected by copyright -- I encourage people to make book-buying decisions based on content, not titles."
2,Fractured information due to overuse of sample sites,"Although I found some decent information in both the organization and construction processes of web interactivity, I also discovered how much effort it took to sort the details. There were too many examples cluttering the flow of information. Definitely not worth the price."
1,Seems to Represent a Culture Gap,"My book on html and javascript was more helpful on interactivity. This book seems to demark a line between people who can ""just do it"" and those who need a board room, 10 people, and six meetings in order to figure out where the best place to stick the navigation bar might be. Those already trained in color theory, minor marketing ideas, and are up-to-the minute with html and other web languages/programs such as Javacript and Flash can skip it. Something about executives copying ""cool"" style leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Those with confidence enough to think for themselves should do so."
3,Poor quality,The frame is cheap cardboard and crushes easliy. So easily that they came crushed on delivery. Invest in a better product.
5,Great book that grows with your baby...,"I started reading this book to my baby boy ever since he was 3 months old. At the time of purchase, I loved the fact that the book is about how much a mother loves her son. My baby loved the sweet pictures at the time and the rhyme of the words. Now, my son is 2 years old and he reads the book himself. He loves the illustrations and loved the fact that the book goes through words and pictures of things he knows like 'teddy bear', 'top', 'bottom', 'bubble', 'fingers', 'toes', 'ears', 'nose', 'eyes', 'mouth', 'laugh', 'giggle', 'cries', 'silent', 'talking', 'walking' and 'running'. As I read the book, my 2-year-old would have a set of actions to go alongside my reading. Its such a fun book to read!!"
5,LOVE THIS BOOK,"This book was given to my son as a Christmas gift from his Godmother. My entire family loves it... we read it together almost every night before bed. I now order it from Amazon whenever I need to send a gift to a child in our family. As an elementary school teacher, when it comes to inspiring a love of reading in young children, you can't beat a book that your kids want to read again and again and again and again!"
5,Sweet message,"Simple book with a sweet message, I can imagine this will be fun as our daughter grows and we point out the different parts of her we love!"
5,It's All About Love,"This is a beautifully written, beautifully bound book that will touch the hearts of children of every age. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves."
5,LOVE IT...,"Such a cute simple book! I read this to my daughter every night, she loves the pictures and the cute story behind it!"
5,Best Book I've Found for My Toddler,"This is the sweetest book I've found for my 14 month old. The whole story is about how much the reader loves their child ""I love you top side and your bottom side, I love you inside and outside"". It is fun to read aloud and heartwarming. It is part of our bedtime routine and a wonderful way to reinforce every day how much you love your child from their giggles to their cries."
5,"Easy to read ""I love you"" book","I bought and received many different ""I love you"" books when I had my daughter. This is the one that holds her attention the most. It is easy to read, the illustrations are adorable and we talk and point out all of the things the mommy or daddy loves, i.e. fingers and toes, eyes and nose. I love this book and am buying it for shower gifts. This book is great for babies and toddlers!"
5,Very sweet toddler book,My 2 year old twins love this book. We read it every night before bed. They like to point to their features as we read - I love your ears and nose... It is a very sweet book with very nice illustrations.
5,Cutest book for a baby or toddler.,Such a simple but powerful message of love to your little one! A must have.
4,I Love You Through And Through,It is educational product but my son doesn't like because he doesn't understand english :) but looks to like pictures on this book
3,Sweet lil book...,I received the book and there was writing on the inside cover. I was not aware of this before purchasing the book. But that aside my son loves the book. The signature doesn't bother either of us at All now. We could care less. :)
3,Not Overly Impressed,"The book was okay. My daughter is only 6 months old, so more high contrast colors would have been great. But this is a very easy read and I am sure it is something that she will enjoy when she is older, as she will most likely be able to read it oin her own."
5,Instant Favorite,This book quickly became one of my 18 month old son's favorites. He loves the pictures and I love the message. He points along at his facial features when we get to that part and loves that the bear is in every picture too. This is a wonderful book for toddlers.
5,Love this book,I bought this book before my son was born. I came acrossed this book looking through the bookstore and instantly fell in love with it. I now read it to my 5 month old son often.
5,Excellent baby shower gift! Powerful and adorable message,"This book is very simple and short, but the message of unconditional love is a powerful one. Makes an excellent baby shower gift as expectant Moms I've encountered also enjoy reading it too as they wait to welcome their little ones.The simple graphics have good contrast and are good for attracting a little ones attention. The simple vocabulary are rhymes are also great for keeping a little ones attention as well."
2,Too short and not much to it.,Just not enough substance or anything to hold my interest or the children. Just not enough for a good book.
5,Wonderful Gift,I love this book. The board pages make it easier to hold while reading with a squirmy little one. The story is lovely with wonderful illustration.I gave this as a gift to all the little ones in my extended family.
5,sweet,Sweet little baby book with good cardboard pages. Words that every child needs to hear no matter what their age.
5,This book is GREAT!,"We checked this out from our public library and now I'm getting ready to purchase it. My son is almost 4 years old and he loves this book. I wish we had found it when he was younger. It IS a great interactive book. When I read it, he makes the expressions (happy/sad) or he does the action (running/walking) or he'll wiggle his fingers/toes, etc. It is so much fun and a great way to have special time with your child letting them know that you love him (or her) ""through and through...yesterday, today and tomorrow, too!"""
4,"The launch of ""Born To Be Wild""","This is really the definitive Steppenwolf album...I remember when it came out and ""Born To Be Wild"" was all over the airwaves. It just kicked that rock and roll summer into high gear. I remember playing that album over and over on my ""suitcase"" stereo, and for a 14 year old boy it was a great testosterone album. They actually have an interesting mix of songs on this album, a little funk, a little blues, straight rock and roll, and even a few ballads. Nice organ work in there as well, with that thick lesley sound and some nice crunchy guitar from John Kay. They got a little cheesey after this album, but this was a good one."
4,books,"I tried to get this book from a different buyer, said it was in stock, was notified it wasn't in stock, so I was very happy when the book arrived, it was needed in a book manuscript."
5,Help for the Helpless,"Love it! Love it! Bought my first computer 8 months ago and it came with every piece of software Microsoft makes. We have a small business and I hoped to use the Word and Office products to get me up and running. Bought Books--hired a tutor--still too much to cope with. Read the reviews on Easy Office and thought 'why not'. It comes in a box with just the CD--no book. It looked like big trouble ahead! Boy, was I wrong. The Tutorial comes right up before you start anything. You know what to look for in advance and the 'Help' really does just that--tells you what to do and how to do it in plain language. This product is the BEST!!!!!!!"
5,Pretty good... I'm impressed.,I'm pretty conservative about trying new software. I needed an office package but didn't want to shell out the big bucks. I came across EasyOffice and took a chance (the price is pretty low)-- and here are my two cents to say that the stuff really works.
3,old,Have not used the book too much. Its old and very used. I thought i would need it for school but can mostly just look words up online
5,Excellent vendor,The book came when it said it would and in excellent condition. I would definately work with this vendor again.
4,Great for interpreting birth charts.,"This is a great book for beginners to learn how to understanding the birth charts and astrology. I always refer to this book when interpreting natal charts. In the back of the book, there's a birth chart interpretation worksheet. The worksheet is a helpful guide when interpreting charts- you will know where to begin. If you take your time to study this book, you will be on your way to becoming an astrologer. And if you contact the author via his web site, he will answer any questions you have regarding the book."
1,Not what was suggested,"I bought this book because it was suggested it was good for learning aspects. Not so, not really. It's not a horrible book, however It is not one if your wanting to really learn aspects."
1,I'd give it no stars if I could,"This was a BORING movie. I can't really say anything else, except it was putting me to sleep. The main characters were never developed. None of them were really interesting to me anyway. If a movie doesn't make me care about the characters and their lives, then the movie is just a waste of time for me. I didn't care about these people or why they were in India. It would have been much nicer if the flood had just swept all these boring people away and swept the soundstage clean to set up for making a more interesting movie. If you like Myrna Loy, who was in this, I recommend you skip this and see her in ""The Best Years of Our Lives""."
1,DVD other zone than EUROPE,I was very disappointed not to be able to watch this DVD. I have no DVD player for zone 1!
5,The Rains Came,"Excellent movie if you are a classic film lover!! It won the 1939 Oscar for Best Effects/Special Effects and I can see why. When the rains came, all hell broke loose. It was pretty amazing for a movie made in the Golden Age of films. Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz were both nominated in the same category, but, obviously, didn't win. Although I love both of those movies, this movie deserved the Academy Award! Story is also very enthralling, adapted from the novel of the same name by Louis Bromfield. A must for any movie collector who loves the classics."
4,Well-done on every level.,"A complex love story periled against the wrath of Mother Nature makes this one of the better films I've seen. The earthquake and dam-busting scenes are superb and frighteningly realistic, echoing images of disaster from another film of similar ideas, ""The Hurricane"" (1937) (read my review of that as well). The cast is great but some of the dialogue sounds totally devoid of any creativity or could even be humanly natural. Nominated for 6 Academy Awards and winning the Oscar for Best Special Effects. A must for disaster, love story, Myrna Loy, and Tyrone Power fans."
4,Come Hell or High Water,"Tyrone Power is an Indian noble--we know this because he wears a turban. Of course, he is also a doctor, appropriately enough a noble profession. Myrna Loy is a bored American socialite trapped in a loveless marriage, who first was after equally jaded old flame George Brent, but now is trading up to the idealisticTyrone. What sets it all in motion? Rain, and plenty of it. It's the rainy season in Ranchipur, but this kind of goes beyond that into catastrophic flood. The special effects are just stupendous as the whole soundstage washes away over and over again. Then the survivors have to deal with an outbreak of typhus--or is it cholera? Well, something that comes from unsanitary conditions affecting the drinking water. Let the rains wash all over you tonight--check out ""The Rains Came."""
5,Bring back the memories!,Great music to listen to back then and nice to be able to find both bands in one CD!
1,Not what I thought,"When I ordered this I thought I was ordering the finished product in the frame like the picture... is misleading. I received the cross-stitch packet. This should be made more clear- wouldn't have purchased, no time to stitch"
5,Easy to do,"I have been doing counted cross stitch for 30 years now and knew this one would probably be easy to follow. What I didn't realize is how fast it would go because I just couldn't put it down and wanted to keep going. When you stitch one hand, you want to find another one. Once all the hands are there, you know you want to get those hearts on there. Then all you have are words and you are done. I also love that now I have the pattern to do this over and over again. I have had friends see this and ask me if I could stitch it for them either as a gift or for them to buy from me. Can't wait to do more."
1,Disappointed,This article has little information in it. You can do your own google search and get much more.
3,"The book was more ""used"" than I expected","I used to have a copy of this same edition, but loaned it and never got it back, so I just wanted to replace it. My copy looked better, so that's why I'm giving this one an ""It's okay"" rating."
4,the first 2000 years,I love this book. It's a great way to gain knowledge of the bible stories which can be confusing and dry reading. I can't wait to get all of the series read.
4,A well written historical account.,"I had the opportunity to read this work and found it to be a well thought out, and well researched historical account. What I found most intriguing was his placement of events into a timeline that could easily be followed by almost any reader allowing the reader to make most of the conclusions regarding the sequential significance. I have read his other two works that regarded the third and fourth thousand years. These works have been a valuable asset in placing events in their proper perspective in regards to the sometimes confusing events depicted in the Old Testament."
5,This book is outstanding!,"This book brought into focus so many of the questions about the creation of Adam and Eve, and why we needed an atonement. It helped me understand the Old Testament, so much better. I loved this book!"
1,'Young Earth' beliefs????,"Gee, I must be in the WRONG time-slot...Anyone who believes in the 'young earth' BS shoul take a close look at:a) Grand Canyonb) remains (fossil & others) of long-time dead plants & animals... say like Dinosaurs! (Yes, some people INSIST that 'God brought them here from other planests!)c) CA Tar Pits, etc.comon, Cleon; you were just 'speaking as a man', weren't you?no thanks"
5,An Excellent Resource for Educators,"As educators we are often guilty of failing to give credit where credit is due. The book, ""The Islamic Connection"" is an excellent resource for educators. Whether teaching history, mathematics or a course on human studies, this book will assist instructors in opening the minds of their students. How exciting to learn that the Islamic way of life, as ancient as it is, holds more truths concerning the organization of the universe, the origin of life and concepts in number theory than we westerners could ever imagine."
2,Left Me Empty,"The book starts out strong and its premise is outstanding. However, the character development is weak and the ending not at all suspenseful."
5,Excellent Follow-up and Departure,"Coconut Telegraph has a much more personal feel than other albums of his during this time period. He sings about his daughter growing up, John Wayne's passing and many trials he and people close him had to contend with. It is a more mature album and is more introspective and contemplative. And this is an excellent side of Jimmy. There are more ballads and the lyrics seem more personal to him. However, he never loses site of the 'Buffett' personality so even in the most contemplative moment, he can interject humor and good time. This is an excellent album and one of my favorites."
5,"This is what you think of, when you think of Jimmy Buffet...","The full-fledged ""beach music"" album, not the pretentious early folk, or the dull middle folk; it's the popular Jimmy Buffett, the sound that made him a star."
5,More songs about the islands and drinking - perfect Buffet,"This is music that is perfect for a friday afternoon in rush hour traffic. Forget all about the office, the overdue work, and anything else that's stressing you out. Buffet is magic and this is one of his best."
5,This is one of Jimmy's best,"This is one album that may take awhile to like but once you do you'll be different. Jimmy will no longer be this hidden star that you don't understand. This CD is funny, serious, and one that you'll never get tired of. It's My Job is one of the best things he's done, Good Fight is neverending and little miss magic is real.Hey I love him and already did befor I heard this one, but this one is special. It never ends!!."
1,Silence does not work,"This was bought to replace an RV smoke detector. The silence false alarm does not work. If you press on the button with a false alarm, nothing happens. Try another product."
2,BLAH,"I am not impressed with it at all. In fact, if I hadn't already opened the package and used it I would have returned it. It doesn't get hot enough to straighten my hair. It merely warms up my hair making it frizzy. I knew that it would make a little hum due to the ion , but it is far too noisy. It's only saving grace for me was that it has the ""combs"".HOWEVER... if you have fine, or thin hair it would probably be wonderful! If you have thick, course hair such as mine, not a good buy."
5,A must for anyone interested in health and fitness!,"I purchased this book to both review and enhance my knowledge of anatomy and physiology. I was most impressed by the step-by-step organization of the material. The self tests are easy to follow and understand. As a personal trainer, I highly (make that strongly) recommend this book for anyone interested in bettering their understanding of the structures within the human body."
5,Buy this reference,"This is a good book to be used as a reference for A and P especially if you find textbooks a little too much to read. This book is great for anatomy and physiology students in college. The info is given in a concise, but informative matter. The material in this book is easy to study from. However, I also used the following books which are also available on amazon.com:Anatomy and Physiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations by Patrick Leonardi(Vol 1) ISBN: 0971999619(Vol 2) ISBN: 0971999627If you want to know the kind of questions that most A and P teachers ask on college exams, buy the last two books. ..."
4,"HELPFUL, but not the best!","I ordered this book because I was taking an Anatomy and Physiology class at my high school. I figured that it could probably help me understand some things better if I could have another source other than the book that I already use. It didn't fail me. This book basically went in just about the same order as my school book, and it provided me with in depth, yet practical, information about certain topics that I really couldn't comprehend from my teacher. It has a lot of good diagrams, and it explains the chemical processes of the body nicely. If you are in a class of this sort, I would advise you to get this book. It could really help you out if you just read it."
2,Not what we expected,"Book was not like new...chapters marked, highlighted in many places. Questions answered in the book! Not what we were expecting when it listed as New...smudge had to be removed from one of the pages."
3,A Good Book to Have,"This book was a requirement for my massage therapy board review class. I like the layout, the illustrations and the simplicity of many of the topics. At the end of every chapters, there's some chapter tests you can take. However,it is still somewhat as technical as some of the college texts books."
2,Not for the layman,"Unless you're a biology major or planning on a career in nursing or medicine, I don't recommend this book. It's hard to understand."
4,some good points,"I used this book for reviewing for the state boards for massage therapy school. Great condition, quick delivery and awsome way to save $ for school!"
1,Unhappy,"I was seriously unhappy I let my 12-year-old daughter read this before I did. And it's not just me, she was really uncomfortable with it, too. The cover is deceptive, I think. Who'd expect a mystery, a cozy(!?) with a charming cat on the cover to contain a sexually explicit scene with a man and a woman and another man with a camera!The rest of the story is all right and for an adult it's all fine. Just don't hand it to your kids."
4,Production...botched!!!,"I have to knock a star off the horrid production on here, otherwise could have been a brilliant album. The Labs brought in well known American producer Neil Kernon to handle the production, Olaf was not satisfied with the sound or mix. He went in to try and ""fix it"", and the whole project ended up a mangled mess. What worked on their previous LP & EP, you have to ask yourself, if it's not broke, why fix it? As usual, great song ideas abound with a flair for the epic, and a nice little concept running, I just can't get past the production. The thin guitar riff sound, the trebly leads, the mewly sounding keybroads, boxy and flat drum sound, even Rob sounds way off in the mix. Olaf ended up quitting to concentrate on Vision Divine. This album could've been a monster. I do like every track on here, except for the last two. Sons Of Thunder did find them start leaning toward more progressive terrain."
3,Slightly disappointed,"I really liked ""Return to Heaven denied"" but this one lacked something. The storyline did not interest me very much. The singer has improved slightly, the pacing was better but nothing really grabbed me. If you are a prog metal fan who has never heard of Labyrinth, I would suggest picking up ""Return To Heaven Denied"" first, its cheaper (no import costs) and IMHO, better. Labyrinth fanatics will probably love it but for the rest of us, maybe not."
3,GREAT PROG METAL FROM ITALY!,"These guys are sooooooooooooooooooo NOT Power Metal, they ARE PROG Metal! Get a clue people! & to ""Absolute Power"" You couldn't be MORE clueless about music if you tried! HammerFall, Iced Earth, & Blind Guardian ARE most definitely Power Metal! & so is Maiden, Sonata Arctica, Stratovarius, etc.!!! ROFLMMFAO!!! Dumb@$$!"
3,A little more punch could have been better...,"The Italians give us a very tasty album again.This is a bit less punchy than ""Return to Heaven Denied"",but anyways,it's a good album.Rob Tyrant(Roberto Tiranti,as in his passport)couldn't go further than in the previous album,so he went,in my opinion,a step behind.He's highly technical,and has an incredible range,but here,he left me wanting to hear more of that range and technique.The singing sounds a bit weak,but all the other aspects of the album are pretty good.Good songs,some of them trying to be something close to ""catchy"",but in my opinion,not as varied and interesting as ""Return to Heaven Denied"".A good album that has some weak points and that in some moments can be a bit boring.But still,not a total disappointment."
3,Pretty good beginners guide,"Pretty good beginners guide. Seems like some beer geeks got together to give people like me a chance to understand the art. Low budget, the co-host guy is very good @ following directions :). My roommate is very into making, beer and I am just trying to understand the process. It was a good video for my current skill level."
5,"Maynard, a cute way to teach manners",A darling way to teach manners so children can relate & not realize that they are learning. My 2 Granddaughters thoroughly enjoy the book. (over & over & over).We look forward to the next book.
5,A Terrific Splash of Sunshine and Thought ...,"... is exactly what I thought when I first heard 'Manhattan Cowboy,' a toe-tapping breath of fresh air that deserves to be heard. Susan Cagle presents, in my opinion, folk music with a pop twist with her youthful, vibrant vocals in this debut outing that should find her on solid ground. While I could go on and on about what I like about her soulful lyrics and the value of the presentation here (the album was recorded at subway stations across New York), I'd rather heave the discovery to those of you most interested in checking out this stellar disk ... however, I will point you in the direction of 'Manhattan Cowboy,' 'Ask Me,' and 'Ain't It Good To Know' as wonderful places to start."
4,"fun, catchy, melodious","I first heard Susan Cagle at the subway station at Grand Central Station about three or four years ago. I was in a rush, like everyone else, but I had to stop and listen to this bright light of a voice shimmering in the grunge of the subway. I bought one of the CDs she had in her guitar case and it immediately became a favorite. Now I love the Subway Recordings. True, the subway acoustics don't give her voice justice. But just like the first time I heard her, her voice rings out true and fresh, sweet and melodious, and it's impossible not to fall in love with her music."
4,Almost like being there,"I hope that this leads to bigger and better things for Susan Cagle. This set is very easy to listen to and the background noise you hear in the subway stations that this was recorded in while in most cases would be a distration, in this case enhances the experience. If you close your eyes while listening you can almost picture yourself standing on the platform watching this woman work for her big break."
4,A ROUGH DIAMOND,"In the Subway Recordings Susan's style, which reminded me of her past with her parents and siblings in the Cagle Family, is refreshing and makes one feel good. I bought the CD because of its unique live-quality (you can hear the subway trains in the background) and I want to support young people who have a similar past as Susan does. She is a rising star and I hope she will work on bringing out more songs. I can recommend this CD to anyone who is into "" feelgood music""."
2,Susan,"Susan is not dating Jay Levine. That is a rumour. The NY magazine article that says that she met her producer in the subway and also met her boyfriend, was refering to her ex boyfriend. Jay Levine is not Susan's boyfriend."
4,more intense than the sample pages show,"After reading reviews in magazines, I was really interested in this book. What I found was VERY surprising and so much more intense than what the reviews and sample pages show. It made me wholly appreciate the beauty of the human body even more. Maybe I missed it somewhere but I had no idea the book was for AIDS (""Move for AIDS""). Also, IT WAS A HUGE BOOK. It really gave a second level when I was going through the book.The diversity of the dancers was amazing, definitely targeting a more world wide audience for a universal cause.Only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because of some of the blurry pictures towards the back. The first couple I appreciated for its intensity and 'movement.' But after awhile I started getting a headache."
2,not worth it.,I wanted to get this book because i was searching for reference pictures for movement . 2 pictures are really nice inside the book but rest is very boring and nothing special.
1,Order is taking too long,I placed the order in August and it is now almost Oct and it still hasn't been mailed out. It's really not worth waiting this long.
3,An average 3 star read.,"The story ""The Judges House"" by Bram Stoker is the highlight of this book of short stories. Stokers description of the interior of the house as the occupant was studying through the night was very creepy.Other than that the rest of the stories were mostly moderatly interesting.Not a bad book, it just wasn't as good as I like a book of short spooky stories to be. I'll say its just an average read.I'll give it a straight down the middle rating of 3 stars. Some people may like it more, some less."
1,Previously returned item.,The package was obviously repacked by someone who returned the item before.The lamp base was dented. The packaging was thrown out and it is not worththe trouble to get new packaging to return it. A credit would be nice or areplacement lamp.
1,Junk. Do not buy this lamp.,"I bought, and returned, TWO of these. It does not stand up straight... it is bent. The white plastic shades are CHEAP PLASTIC (like plastic cups) ... not fine acrylic and not glass. It's just cheap, cheap, cheap in its look and feel. Very disappointing."
3,It's OK,"Delivery by Amazon was -- as always -- fast and without any problems. The lamp looks exactly as it looks on the picture and is ok. Just do not forget that the shades are plastic and not glass (it would be so much nicer if they were glass). The light is bright, although you can't use strong light bulbs because of the plastic shades. I keep the lamp as it fits its purpose - though the plastic shades makes it look cheap."
4,Love the lamp,"Unfortunately, one of the hard plastic shades was slightly cracked. Too costly to return, and there are no guarantees the new one might not come the same way, so I have kept it. Great on our kitchen table. Saves putting on the overhead."
4,Great Lamp for Price.,"Received lamp today and am using it already. Like the floorlamp it is paired with, the only reason I cannot give it five stars is that the on/off switches are chrome painted or plated plastic and do not match the brushed metal of the remainder of the lamp. This was a little disappointing. As I mentioned in my update of the floorlamp, this is not a disappointment in the seller, but the manufacturer. Seems so easy to have brushed metal on/off switches on such an otherwise great lamp. I would be glad to order replacement brushed metal switches and pay for them if available. Otherwise, this would be a five star item.It matches well the floorlamp as indicated in the Amazon description. A good lamp, with superior styling, at a good price."
2,This book is good if you like to read catalogs.,"This book is just a large collection of specs. and marketing info from various part mfgs. This book doesn't have the information I wanted to make informed part buying decisions(ie.test results). Example: when giving one of the few real world ""observations"" the review of a supercharger was ""... said the additions provided an ""unbelievable difference"" in performance over the stock configuration."" DUH!!! Only good thing about this book I can say is it does have alot of P/N's and company products in one place. I started to send it back but rationalized I would keep it as a reference catalog."
2,"okay, but you can do better","This is 1997 collection of parts, no how to, no performance numbers. An okay reference source, but you can buy a monthly mag and get better stuff."
5,"this book is excellent, and i generally hate anthologies","what a book! its one down side was the poems interspersed throughout the prose, so basically i just skipped or skimmed them, but the prose included - WOW! from World War I to the Spanish Civil War to WWII to Korea to Vietnam, just an amazing selection of writings of people's experiences in war. if there's any book that's going to make you anti-war it's this one. buy this book and expand your education!"
3,Yes. Nothing Fancy,"Saturday Night Special is a cheap hand gun that you can enter a bar with. Cheap bars are called honky tonks. Cheating women make you mad. Railroads are good places to write a song on. I'm A Country Boy, so what? If you are on the hunt, that means you are seeking foxes. Am I Losin', if you are a loser that is right. Whiskey Rock-A Roller,rock n roll and booze."
1,Not what I expected,I was expecting the book to be in good condition but It wasnt. It was in ok condition with underlining through out the book. The details when I brought the book should have said that.
4,Catch That Snipe,"This is a very good cd, though not easily classified by genre. Excellent instrumentation, biting lyrics, and solid vocals. Love the title track and it's message. Also love, ""Super Fine,"" which reminds me of the old Chambers Brothers song ""Time Has Come Today,"" the mocking ""King of Paperclips,"" and the ballad-like ""Girl From An OK Town."" One negative, need to dump those background ""singers"" a.k.a. ""The Hipwaders"" who thankfully appear on only one song."
5,"Thank you, Leonard Pitts, Jr.","A wonderful combination of ethnography and autobiography. I especially appreciated the candidness on page 171, when the author describes visiting his father's grave after being hit with many hurtful memories. He was finally able to really grieve about the painful years of abuse. It needs to be understood in our society that time does not diminish feelings. The passage reminded me of an interview with Morrie Schwartz when he cried about his mother's death that had happened many years ago. Ted Koppell asked him why it was still so painful after all this time and Morrie explained how time did not take away the feelings. I really appreciate men being able to open up and disclose their pain. This book has also helped me understand men's anger towards their emotionally unavailable fathers a lot better."
1,complete waste of money.,"This item not only does not fit properly and I have an average shoe size -- size 8 -- but it contains nothing that helps my bunion and bone spur at base of great toe. Do not waste your money. In fact, go to CVS if you want to try it, as it costs a lot less."
4,Buy this album . . . you wont stop listening to it,"I heard abot this band from a friend of a friend of a friend, etc. and I began to enjoy the CD more and more as listened to it over and over again. The vocals and the musicianship are outsanding. The drumming on this album carries the music far with solid in-the-pocket grooves. The songs are incredibly structured and very catchy. I can't stop listening to this CD. I suggest you go out and buy a copy as soon as you feel ready. . . ready for them badass grooves!"
5,Great for student choosing major,"The book is really great. It tells the path that students should take to have biology as a major. There are also many stories of the successful people in the field and career options listed in the book. I also just realized that there are many careers related to biology and I can start to plan my future life. It is really helpful for students that are undecided which major to choose. Besides, I think other reviews also agree with me that this book is helpful."
2,Boy is this toy annoying!,"Any toy that makes music with no shut off is no toy that I want at home. While this is colorful and durable, it is hard to tell what the individual pop onz pieces are for. They aren't the kinds of components that a child can easily recognize and then utilize for pretend play. For instance there is some kind of piece that is supposed to represent a water barrel, but it looks so non descript that it is hard to identify how to play with it. The only quality that appealed to my daughter and her friends who played with it, was that it makes music when you touch it in the slightest manner. This is the very same quality that is annoying to the adult members of the household. This toy, thankfully we didn't purchase ourselves because we are selling it at our yard sale soon and we know that we will take a beating on the actual retail value. Oh well."
3,Hot Wheels,Nice gift at a good price. My nephew loved it. It would have been nice if you could have seen what cars you were going to get prior to purchase though.
4,How Wheels,"I ordered this product as a decoration for a Baby shower. I let the mom to be keep them for her son too. The selection of cars were pretty sweet! There were race cars, vans, and monster trucks!"
4,wonderful,"Great gift idea, my kids loved it. I have triplets and they got to split the set and they are still playing with them."
5,Nice hot weel car set,"We bought this Hot weel as a gift , but i am sure our cousin in Thailand will love it ."
5,Gift for my niece.,Niece loved it. Great bargain. Highly recommend. She really enjoys the different styles and amounts of vehicles that she can plaay with.
4,For the Godson,This was the XMas gift for my Godson this year. He's still at the age where hot wheels are just loads of fun and having a variety of them to play with his father on the tracks and such they already own is a good time and bonding experience for them both. Sometimes the simpler gifts are the best ones and this 20 pack of little cars fit that description perfectly.Many kids have fond memories of playing with hot wheels and I'm glad I could contribute to my godson's memories while he is still a child and the world is a wide open and wonderful place.The quality of these cars is still up to par and the fun factor is there. This isn't an educational toy and not all toys should be educational. This is just something to play with and imagine and they work perfectly in this regard.
4,Hot wheels gift pack,"I bought this for my grandson who is only 4 years old, he has the best time playing with the cars, he makes them crash and jump and he pretends he is the driver and lines them all up for a race, very durable and fun toy I'm pleased with this purchase"
5,cars,i bought these for my grandsons birthday and he is going to love them. I didnt get to pick the package but the one they sent me was full of very cool cars. service was fast and very happy with product.
5,Great Gift,"I had bought this for my nephew as a gift in October who lives in Boston. He's 4 years old and loves cars, he was very excited to receive the gift."
5,Hot Wheels fan.,"First of all, I only collect the cars for interest (and maybe play a bit), but it still is good."
1,"Apparently, being a racist is good manners!","I read some parts of this racist book, the main premise of which is that manners are color-based--not culture-based. For example, did you know that if you give a housewarming or wedding gift, you should consider giving something that's ""afro-centric""? I suppose that, since I have white ancestry, I should present some Klan paraphernalia at the next office party. No other book on etiquette I've read suggests anything anything so in-your-face as that. I can say with some certainty that other etiquette advisors (including Emily Post and Miss Manners) do not provide advice on such situations as walking in on vigorous adulterous situations that the author apparently believes are commonplace. (The author's advice: Close the door quietly and say nothing to anyone! Common-sense advice: Scream to put an immediate end to the act!)"
2,Really bad...,"I saw this play in Canada, and loved it, but I was so dissapointed when I borrowed the CD. Only the man who plays Don Quixtote can sing. The others just set my teeth on edge-the play deserves better singers..."
1,Man of La Mancha - the Movie,"Great Disappointment - have seen the play 4 times, but not the movie. The Soundtrack is terrible - Peter O'Toole can't sing. Recommend the original play version - 5 star."
4,"""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder""","I have heard both good and bad things about this musical, but it is by far my favorite. I highly recomend this cast recording, they do a good job. If you are a dreaming, who ofetn finds themselves questioning the world as it is, then you can't live without this cd. I suggest to you who are just looking for a classic that you haven't yet heard pick this one up."
4,A beautiful score!,THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM is Richard Kiley's trademark. Other notable songs make this CD a must.
4,WORTH the FOURTH!!!!,"I think this is the best and most exciting interpretation and performance of Tchaik 4 that I've ever heard (from the start of mvt 1 - to the crashing finale). This CD is worth it alone for the playing that Mravinsky and the Leningrad Phil do on Tchaik 4.The other symphonies are quite good, but i feel there are better recordings out there (Gergiev Tchaik 6 is unbeatable).What makes the 4th here so wonderful? Well, it's quite simply the ferver, commitment, and drive that these players muster up to push this wonderful symphony throughout.It is extreme - the musicians are pushing themselves to the limits - which I feel is what Tchaikovsky is about. The playing on this disc is full of passion, which I would take over anything else in music. Passion.A wonderful performance all around, you won't be dissapointed by symphonies 5 and 6 in the slightest, but I don't feel they are the best versions.This CD is a MUST HAVE for all Tchaik fans."
2,"fast, fervent, heroic, and raucous","Mravinsky puts it simple, blunt, and direct. He's captain obvious. Perhaps this was a form of irony which once served a useful purpose in protesting Soviet autocracy. To my ears, Tchaikovsky has never sounded so trashy."
3,Excellent selection,"I am jazzed by this selection, but first a few caveats. I'd have left out ""Berlin"" and ""The Blue Mask"" (particularly considering there are much better tunes on the source CDs/LPs). And most songs from the latter half of the CD (and the latter half of Lou's career) are simply mediocre.That said, there are 8 songs I'd gladly program, put on ""repeat"" and listen to for hours. That's quite a deal if you buy this CD used from Amazon. I'm particularly pleased by the version of ""Sweet Jane"" that was selected: from the Velvet Underground's ""Loaded"" LP. There are many other good versions (Lou's LP, many live versions) but this one has an edge. There are no crappy covers/fakes on this CD, even the re-makes are clearly labeled (e.g., Satellite of Love 2004).Good buy for long-time Lou fans and newbies."
1,The slippers with bamboo arches,Don't buy these made in China shoes. I bought these and the pink ones with the toe out. It feels like they must have put bamboo in the arches. I had to take a HAMMER and beat the lumps where the arches (bamboo) were down so I could walk on them.
3,"Great performance, terrible transfer","While Lipatti's playing is sublime, this recording billed as a restored transfer suffers from some serious defects. The right and left channels have been phase shifted, apparently to create ""artificial stereo"". This makes the Schumann painful to listen to. In addition it suffers from some very low frequency noise. Some of it sounds like road noise which is intermittent. With careful listening and intelligent noise reduction, most of this could be reduced to a tolerable level.However, it is possible for the knowledgeable buyer to alleviate many of the problems with a good sound processing program. It is too bad that previously released material has to be repacked in such a poor fashion."
3,This is not the REO that you get.,"The cover shows Gary Richrath with the old REO. The actual concert you get is a post 2000 REO with the current member line-up. It is footage from one concert, not the best live from 1978-1982. Deceiving advertisement but still a good concert for all REO fans."
5,My family loved it!,"I ordered this fudge for my step father and ailing grandmother. They told me it was some of the best fudge they had ever eaten, and believe me, they eat a lot of fudge. The price was great, and it arrived within days of my ordering it."
5,A necessity for any singer wanting to get to the next level,"As a singer, sometimes what is taught to you is ethereal and ineffable. Hong-Young effectively lays out the ground work for developing and maintaining an effective, efficient, and exceptional voice. Not only does she explain things in a pedogological manner, she also brings heart and soul into the voice and its power. An all-around great resource for the beginner to the advanced professional."
5,Treasure Chest of years of singing wisdom,"Absolutely complete! The finest instruction on voice in book form. REALLY. Arabella Hong-Young is my teacher and if you'd like to see what this book can do for you check out my work: www.newyorktenor.com and watch the ""Younger Than Springtime"" Video."
5,What a character!,"Just like the rascally raccoon he is, Mr. Pippin is such a little character learning about life and being a raccoon. Johannah Bluedorn has once again done a superb job of illustration."
3,Jess' mother and grandmother tell their stories of the South,"This is a great book for any Fred Chappell fan. Those readers familiar with Jess and Joe Robert from ""I Am One of You Forever"" and ""Brighten the Corner Where You Are"" will recognize the voices of Jess' mother and grandmother as they tell their stories of kit and kin in rural North Carolina. I love the stories about Sherlie Howes (Chappell's interpretation of a mountain Sherlock Holmes). While he doesn't quite capture the feminine voice, I love him for trying -- and for recognizing the importance of Southern women in keeping the stories of our humanity alive. If you're a Chappell fan, you must by this book"
4,"Graceful, funny, fine storytelling.","Each of the chapters is a tale remembered by young Jess Kirkland, as told to him by his grandmother or mother: tales of the women of their community in the hills of North Carolina. They are tales rich in language, rich in humor, rich in the poetry and music of their lives. Chappell has woven a fine fabric, faithful to storytelling traditions and forms. He will make you believe that there can be nothing finer in this life - and possibly the next - than to sit quietly on the porch watching ""the goldfinches glittering in the poplars"" while the voices of two loving women sing sweet harmony"
2,best part isn't even by jeff beal,"the tone for the shows music was created by wendy melvoin & lisa coleman...the theme they created is the best part of this cd. too bad more of the original music from the first season wasn't included in this compilation. also, just a correction to a previous post; the people who designed the main titles won the emmy, not jeff beal."
2,Film music,Jeff Beal is a brilliant composer without any doubt. However this recording is rather disapointing. The tracks are very short and you never get real into the music and engaged. May I recommend Perpetual Motion or Three Graces which both are excellent examples of the highly skilled composer.
4,comfy & keeps my feet warm,"I expected the material to be thicker where you put your feet into it, but it does keep my feet warm when they are in there, and it makes sitting in my rocking chair more comfortable. it is also compact and easy to store under the rocker so it doesnt get in the way when not in use."
4,soft comfort for my feet,"I love the lightness and comfort of this. However, I have a dog who sheds so I can see hair on it."
3,"Good story, Bad recipe book","The stories behind the development of these recipes is very interesting. So if you are looking for the stories behind the way the Amish cook, this book is worth the price. However if you intend to actually USE the book to cook then don't waste your money. The recipies set you up for failure from the beginning. The pie crust on page 117 is dry and does not roll out well. The ratio of flour to wet ingredients is wrong. The chicken pie recipe on page 15 is exceptionally bland and the crust is too wet for rolling. The addition of extra flour helps but it's still a hard dough to work with. I would not recommend this book for people who cook unless you are an experienced cook who can recognize and correct what's wrong by sight and feel before you are finished with the recipe."
2,I was not impressed,"I had taken out this book at the library and I liked it. The book was hard back cover and didnt have all the history before each recipe. I already know the history, I only wanted the recipes. There for I was not totaly happy with this book"
1,WARNING!!!,"If you're looking for flesh eating zombies, they're not here. This is an Italian horror movie and Italian horror is different from American horror, or at least it was when these movies were made. They have much stronger ties to traditional European horror of the 19th century and before. So, if you like that stuff, or you're curious, read the 3, 4 and 5 star reviews, they'll be more helpful to you. Pay no attention to my 3 star rating - I didn't even want to rate this movie, because I don't like this stuff, but to publish my comments, I had to. I hope I helped you."
2,lame,"I love zombie movies but this one is dam lame.2 stars is pretty generous but the absurdity of this movie gave me some cheap laughs and put me in a more giving mood.However,this one is so boring and uninspired. It looks and sounds like someone sent the negative through a paper shredder. What we have here is some people who go exploring some old monastary or something and then these blind zombies (supposed templar nights..give me a break) go hunting them, by sound alone. They can hear you breath and hear your heart beating. Perhaps next time, we can have the dreaded templars (i've read there are 3 or 4 of these templar adventures) in space! Don't all horror heroes end up there eventually? I suppose if you bring out the beers and want a half hearted chuckle, you could watch this one."
1,A nice transfer of a really poor film.,"I'm a big fan of what Elite does, and in general I view their entire catalog as a listing of some of the finest horror films made, but this one let me down. It's a bad movie. I have to admit that after sitting through ""Tombs"", I didn't have the stamina to try ""Return of the Blind Dead"" on the other side of the disc. Who knows, maybe it's a really good film, but I doubt it.The acting, makeup effects, and music are all second-rate, but that's entirely forgiveable in a low-budget horror film. Heck, sometimes that adds to the charm. Unfortunately, this film combines those, uh, charms with a mundane story, boring monsters, and a pathetic attempt to be titilating by introducing a gratuitous lesbian substory and two breast scenes, one of which is clearly a prosthetic.The best part of the disc is the nice video transfer."
3,They Can Hear Your Heartbeat,"Amando de Ossorio's legendary films series collectively and affectionately known as ""the Blind Dead"" is definitely not for everyone. However if you are one of the chosen few who love low budget Euro-Horror from the 70's this is the gold standard of the genre. This Anchor Bay release contains two from the series; `Tomb of the Blind Dead' and Return of the Blind Dead.' If you're a fan you probably know that all four films are now available in a boxed set from Blue Underground which offers fully restored, remastered, high definition, prints.So then why buy this disc you ask? I keep my Anchor Bay copy because believe it or not I've discovered a scene or two in `Tombs of the Blind Dead' that are missing from Blue Undergrounds' definitive edition. If you're like me and can't stand to have parts missing than get them both. If it doesn't bother you then go for the boxed set collection.My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-."
4,Spanish Horror NOT Italian,"Just for the record, for those of you who read the review by Chris, these are of course Spanish films, not Italian. By the way, they are great !"
5,The Long Way Home Project,"If you were there, you need to see this film series. It tells the story we wanted to tell, but could not. Rejected by The History Channel as too ""right wing"". See [URL] for the full story. Buy it here and cast your vote for the truth."
1,a quantum step down,"A few years ago this would have been an 'OK' calendar, but after the magnificent 2002 Ships of the Line offering, this one is a HUGE disappointment. Small, washed out and poorly detailed (for the most part) pictures make this item best left on the shelf.Hopefully, next year the team that put the 2001 calendar together will work on the 2003 edition. PLEASE!"
2,Disappointed,"I love the 2001 Star Trek Ships of the Line calendar; I am disappointed with the 2002 calendar. There are only one or two shots that I like, with an additional one or two that are ""acceptable"". I thought the title should dictate what you should expect to see. Instead, you get some partial shots of ships and the so-called action shots are just plain blurry. If I had taken a photo that turned out like that, I would've thrown it away. Hopefully the 2003 calendar, if there is one, will get back to the standards set by the 2001 calendar."
1,What a [let down]!!!,"To say that the title 'Ships of the Line' is misleading, is an understatement. I was expecting something along the same lines as the 2001 calender, a more technical, close-up look at the ships themselves. Maybe, I'm out of touch, but I don't think 50 work bees parked in a bay qualifies as a 'ship of the line'. Somehow I think the issuers were just capitalizing on the success of the 2001 calender. It would have been more appropriatley named, 'Star Fleet: A Day in the Life'.I had to give this one star just because it was Star Trek, and because the rating system doesn't allow for zero stars."
1,Not what you expect.,Some of the pictures were extracted from the movies and series.But they are smeared or otherwise distorted. Maybe for copyright reasons. But the other pictures are drawings/prints of paintings.There are so many other pictures they could have done. There areso many other ships. This calendar is not worth the time or money. make your own calender with pics off the web.
1,Don't bother,The worst Star Trek Calendar I've ever owned. I've loved all the past TNG and Voyager calendars and tried something new this year. Boy was I disappointed - blurry pictures of ships that you can't even make out. I wish I could return it. I'll have to go buy the Voyager calendar!
2,Second Year Disappointment,"Last year's Star Trek Ships of the Line was my most favorite Star Trek calendar ever. Although I enjoy the actors who play some of my favorite characters, staring at their faces for a month at a time gets a little tiresome. Last year's, poster-style 3D rendering pictures kept me captivated all year. But what impressed me most was the comments I would receive from co-workers who were impressed by the stunning images as well. Most of those people were not Star Trek fans. There are a few good pictures in the 2002 calendar, but most are completely unidentifiable--even to fans. I'm hoping this year's poor effort is because of Foundation Imaging's busy schedule with other projects. Hopefully, with new stock images from Enterprise and Nemesis--we'll have a better entry next year."
2,Out of foucs - Foundation needs glasses,"The previous calendar was, well, a work of true art! However, in this version, Foundation has added, haze, fog, blurriness, black & white . . anything to hide the true beauty. Only the picture for Jan 2002 is fantastic.Not only that, Foundation messed up on the Galaxy class ship in the center fold out. It was labeled Challenger but someone forgot to delete the ""enterprise"" name & registry from the rest of the picture.I sure hope they fix their problems. This calendar is a ""pass"" in my book."
2,What the heck happened???,"Last year's Ships of the Line calendar was beyond spectacular. This year's is bizarre, boring, and genuinely disappointing. Here's hoping they bring back the 2001 artist for 2003."
5,DVD coming soon (early 2001),Just to let you know the 2 of One metallica VHS will soon be re-released on DVD with a new 5.1 mix. This video is short but nevertheless would make a great DVD.
4,Metallica in the English classroom,"For anyone teaching Dalton Trumbo's anti-war novel Johnny Got His Gun, Metallica's video ""Two of One"" is a must. I showed the tape to my college-prep level 11th graders and they were mesmerized (probably as much by the fact that I would play a Metallica video in school as by the contents/music). It is entirely appropriate, the musical artistry is great, and the vintage clips from the cult classic 70's film of Johnny Got His Gun are unique. One of my classes asked to see the tape a second time! As a teaching tool, this tape provides a creative way of handling the themes of loss and powerlessness. Plus, if you have any kind of anti-war agenda, the video is extremely relevant. Buy it and show it!"
4,FASCINATING,"In spite of its brief running time this is an interesting video. What I found most amusing however was when the crew screws up and Lars says something along the lines of ""Don't worry about it, we're just keeping this informal"". HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED!!.Metallica back when they were still cool.I wonder, how can I get my hands on a tape of JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN? If anybody out there knows, contact me, okay?"
5,Amazing book,"This deft blend of memoir, sociology, and sharp cultural observation makes for a fascinating and at times heartbreaking read. Teenage Waistland will appeal to anybody who has ever had a distorted or even just complicated relationship to food, eating, and body image...which is just about everybody I know. Really took me back to the high school cafeteria. The book is well written and moves quickly, with plenty of humor along the way. A five-star read."
4,Keeps you warm,Keeps you warm at ball games. Have tried other brands and they do not get as warm as these do or stay as hot for as long as these. I just wished they had one for your whole body ;) lol I have RA and these work great too when your just out and about and need some heat on a joint. Makes the pain go away for a little while.
5,Works well.,I am a police officer and I place the hand warmers in my gloves. This product works well and helps with the bitter northeast cold.
5,very good product at very reasonable price,"I bought this product to keep my daughter's hands warm before musical auditions. It works very well. It can be used with or without gloves/mittens. One problems with the glove/mitten-only approach is that the hands sometimes get sweaty. That doesn't help when you need to have precision and speed in playing your instrument. Hothands solves this problem pretty well. Once unsealed, it lasts longer than similar products from other brands. The price is very good and the stuff keeps for a long time as long as it is sealed."
5,HotHands.. Hand Warmers,I get these for the troops serving overseas. It gets to be freezing in some areas and they are very thankful to have them during those cold periods of winter in Iraq and Afghanistan. The soldiers are always asking for these to be sent over so its the least I could do for some of our troops.
1,Lasts very short time,"The package says ""lasts up to 10 hours,"" but these hand warmers generated heat for about 1 hour. Avoid this product."
1,They don't work!,I have been using handwarmers for years while skiing. I decided to switch to this cheaper brand. DON'T! They do not work. I called the company-they shipped me a new box-they don't work either! Don't waste your $!
2,You get what you pay for...,"I purchased a 6-pack of these at Wal-Mart for $1.24. Our cheerleaders were outside selling candy as a fundraiser in a 39-degree rainstorm. I thought these would do the job because they are small enough to fit inside a pocket or gloves. What a disappointment! It took at least 30 minutes for each packet to get slightly warm, and that was it! Will definitely spend the extra money next time to get the larger size."
1,Tried 3 packages and they never warmed up,"Followed directions but product didn't work at all. In fact, it created some sort of moisture in my glove and actually made my hands colder. Tried opening package and left them out to see if they worked better when fully exposed to air; still never warmed up."
3,Only 20 Pairs in Box but works fine.,"The product works just fine. We used it skiing. The pads are a bit big, but will still fit into the pocket in mittens. The issue I have is that there aren't 40 pairs in the box. There are actually 40 packages, each containing exactly 1 handwarmer. That may be why these are so much cheaper than the competition."
5,A must for Raynaud's and Arthritis sufferers,"If you are not familiar with Raynayd's disease, your capallaries contract in your extremeties in cool weather or stressful periods. Suqsequently this magnifies the cold feeling and you can't warm your hands up. Gloves alone can't do the trick. Putting these in your gloves can provide significant relief for long periods!! Within minutes of opening the pouch, the small palm-sized bag of granules begins to warm - and they stay warm for 8-10 hours as advertised. On days I am in the house, I keep two in my jacket pockets and hold them when my hands start getting cold again. This is much more convenient than running warm water for five to 10 minutes over your hands to get them warmed up, then repeat every hour or two. I highly recommend these!!"
5,Love the Heatmax Hot Hands 2 Handwarmers,"We have used several brands of hand warmers inside the pouches of our ski gloves. I found these online and they work very well -- so far, not a dead one in the bunch! I hate freezing cold fingers when I'm skiing. These warmers work great the whole day. In fact, they are usually warm when I get home some 10 hours after I start. I think they are a good deal for the price."
5,Wonderful Hand Warmers!,"I purchased these for my Mom who is on kidney dialysis 3 days a week.During treatment she (as well as other patients) get muscle cramps that are extremely painful. There are not enough plugs for heating pads, and no microwave available to heat reusable heating items, so I was at a loss on how to help eleviate her pain, when I found these.The box of 80 is only roughly $24 + shipping and each pack remains hot for 10 hours and it is the best find yet to help my Mom's pain!They have been so helpful, my Mom has handed out several to other patients to use and has told them where to purchase them for their relief.Dialysis is so hard on a person, and my Mom is 81 yrs old; it kills me that I can not do more to stop her pain; but these hot packs have provided such relief that I am grateful to have found them at a price that will not bust her limited income budget.Thank you,Lynn A.HeatMax Hot Hands 2 Handwarmer (40 Pairs)"
5,Great item,"These really do the trick....as an older guy who has reduced circulation in his hands a feet I did consider buying heated gloves and socks but my time outdoors is often spent shoving show, roof raking and operating heavy equipment...I tend to wear out standard gloves/mittens regularly and the thought of having to replace heated gloves regularly was disconcerting.I use them with insulated mittens...they obviously would not heat one's cold fingertips if one was wearing gloves."
4,"good size, so portable","I like this product, and my coworkers like it too, so they ordered some as well.It's small, one for each hand, and heats up when you shake it in the air.But, you have to keep them in your pockets the whole time to keep it warm, and take it out occasionally to use.It does get pretty hot in the pockets though, so have thick pockets where the material isn't pressing against your skin ('cause it'll turn pink).I'd say, it's good for temporary warmth and will not keep your entire body warm, just your pockets and hands.It does last quite a bit of hours though."
2,Disappointed,These handwarmers are not what I expected. I would advise that you purchase a different brand. I run daily and like to put them in my gloves to keep my hands warm. They will not warm your hands if the weather is below 20 degrees.
4,As ordered,"The handwarmers are for my mom, who has Rheumatoid Arthritis. These help her to keep the pain at bay throughout the night. Ordered, shipped and received extremely efficiently and quickly. Thanks!"
4,Warm hands,"These ""Hot Hands"" hand warmers are pretty good. They keep the palms of your hands very warm, but the heat doesn't go all the way out to the tips of your fingers. They only warm your fingers a little."
5,"Long-lasting, Warm Heat","My wife and I ride our motorcycles in some pretty cool weather. We have heated gloves, but our toes were always cold. We tried several brands of chemical warmers, but found most of them got HOT initially - too hot for the toe of your riding boot. However, the Hot Hands Brand provides consistent, gentle heat for hours, and keeps our toes toasty warm. We never ride without a few packs in our bags even in the Summer. I highly recommend them."
5,Warm for the day,"My husband used these the other day at work when it was about 20 degrees F outside (about 10 with wind chill). He works outside for the entire day, handling cylinders in an open air dock.He loved these! He gave a few to his co-workers, and they loved them too! I asked when he came home if they were still warm and he said yes. They do take about 20-30 minutes to fully warm up. But they took the chill off from the day and made it comfortable for him to work and be out in the cold. He put one set in his boots (typically steel toe, without extra consultation) and one set in his gloves, which are not insulated either."
5,great hand warmers,"The hand warmers came just in time for our last Ski Team events. The box included some free toe warmers, too. Love the free shipping!"
4,An extremity lifesaver and made in the USA!,"I am just not a fan of cold weather and neither are my fingers and toes. These hand warmers saved me from brutally cold weather and along with layering thermals and coats, made the freezing temperatures bearable. I give only 4 stars because I do wish that they could heat up more quickly. To heat up fully it takes approximately 10-15 minutes and some of the packets are warmer than others (which is bizarre). Overall though, this is a great product and a must-have in cold weather."
2,Hit or Miss handwarmers,"Since thwas hand warmers had such good reviews, I didn't think I could go wrong in choosing them. unfortunately for me, I was part of the few that received a box with defective warmers.I'm not sure if all of these are suppose to work but I sure hope the company expects each hand warmer to do its job. I had to open 4 warmers before getting to one that was producing some sort of heat worth carrying with me. almost felt like I was scratching tickets.Amazon's not really a gambling site like eBay, so I hope people understand that some of these hand warmers may be hit or miss. good batches and bad batches. if I was to do it again, I'd get a better set of gloves for the 30$ more that I put towards these. I don't really write negative reviews but for such a high star rating I expect results."
2,Poor Heat,"They take a really long time to heat up, and lose their heat fast if they're not exposed to the air."
4,Heatmax hands good on a cold day,I really enjoy this product on the colds days of watching my childrens outdoor sports. It makes the games go a lot faster. The only problem I have with this product is that some of the pouches do not seem to get as warm as the others. But on a real cold day even the cooler pads are a blessing.
5,Love them,"These are great to carry along in the glove compartment and I also give them as gifts to people who work and/or play outside. My snowmobiling friends love them, as does my father who spends a lot of hours outside on the farm and cutting wood."
1,Was a good deal before price was doubled,It is really odd how this product was $13 one dad then $26 the next. Not worth it at the current price.
1,SHORTED!!!,"Ordered a box of 40, I counted 3 times...only 38 shipped!!!! I'm going to have to call to resolve! Gees...You should get the amount that they state in the ad. They wouldn't ship if I was a few dollars short! I called Amazon, they are telling me that I need to ship the 38 pairs that I received back to them to get the correct amount shipped! I think I'm through with Amazon. It's supposed to be easy to deal with, instead I get a foreign customer representative who is very difficult to understand and unwilling to ship the missing 2 pairs. DONE WITH AMAZON."
2,Good Transaction,The seller is good. I got what I ordered it is just the product itself is not satisfied my needs. The pad is too small so it is not as hot as the bigger size. I ended up buying the bigger size for our snow trip.I will not buy this product again.Anh Nguyen
4,Great bargain,"I have not actually opened any of the packs, but I use hand warmers all the time and this was a great deal."
1,Disappointed,The item shipped was a bad batch. It didn't work this time. It took too long to warm-up and less than half the time it didn't even warm up. I've tried this brand before and it was fine but this time luck was not on my side.
2,10 Hours of Heat?,For some reason I do not seem to get anywhere close to 10 hours of heat. I have been using these for my gloves for skiing. Often they seem to go dead within four hours. They also do not seem to get as warm as many hand warmers I have used.
1,HORRIBLE,"I'm a military flightline worker. it was 29 degrees out so i threw one warmer in each of my gloves, one in each of my boots and one on my shirt. the most heat i got was for half an hour, and that was only one the boot&hands. i had them all on for about 2hours and the back warmer never warmed up, the rest were gone within the 2 hours and i just threw them out. dont buy this brand ever, unless you feel like wasting your money on 2 hours of hear, and then wasting it on another pack. I will never by this ever again, I'm going to go buy a new pack of another brand ASAP"
1,"Poor quality, chemical spill","We bought some of these instead of our usual brand because the size fit a glove we had bought. We've now used them on several mornings and at least half the time they have broken open, spilling some dark colored material inside the glove and ultimately on hands and floors. I don't know what the material is, or whether it is dangerous, but it is certainly messy and unreliable. We use a variety of sizes and makes of warmers and have never had this happen before. Go elsewhere."
1,Don't Buy!!,These barely warm up. I used these while biking and skiing and half the warmers in the package don't warm at all. Beware. Do not buy.
1,Bad Product Compared To Others,"I ride a motorcycle every day and in the morning, my hands are absolutely freezing when I get into work. A friend bought me a couple pairs of Grabber Hand Warmers. They worked so well, I rushed out and bought these HeatMax Hot Hands 2 because the price was slightly cheaper, the reviews were very positive, and I thought I'd get similar results. I was so wrong. The HeatMax warmers did not get anywhere close to being as warm as the Grabber warmers did, nor did they stay warm as long as the Grabbers. I went through and reread the positive reviews on this product just to see if I missed something. I can very honestly say I have no idea how this product got so many positive reviews. I'd be highly cautious when reading them because I'm certain some of the reviewers haven't tried other similar products.This was a complete waste of a purchase for me. I'm going back and ordering what I should have ordered in the first place. I should have orderedGrabber Hand Warmers."
5,Cold weather games,As a fastpitch softball coach in a Northern climate nothing can beat these. I buy a case a season and the kids love them. My pitchers insist on them
2,Not as good as last year's product,"Last year I purchased 3 cases with no problem. This year, I've also purchased 3 cases (so far) this year. Two new problems. One, they don't last as long as they previously did but this is minor in comparison to the second issue. My nails and cuticles are getting black gunk on them from the packets either leaking or opening completely. Yuck! Great product, but quality control needs to be improved."
1,Did not work and slow replacement from Heatmax,Ordered a box of hand warmers. Product just got slightly warm. Company said they had some bad product and would replace it. Got very slow service from company. Over two weeks and still no replacement.
2,"This is not the advertised Hot Hands ""2""","The newer Hot Hands 2 is what is advertised, but what is shipped is the older original Hot Hands. The newer one is the improved version which is not what was shipped."
4,Good,These are good hand warmers. They are a bit cheaper than the other hand warmers. The reason is that they take a long time to warm up. You get what you pay for. I just start to warm them about 5-10 before I need them. It is worth the savings.
4,great gift for a college student,"What a great gift for a college student living in the mid-west or eastern states.Portable, long lasting and disposable. Kept our college boy warm all last winter at Case in Ohio."
5,Wonderful for hand pain due to arthritis and achy joints,I tape these to my thumb joint and hands to help alleviate arthritic pain. I have also taped them to my knee to alleviate pain. They do a great job.
5,Great Heaters,Keep my hands warm at the barn and when snow blowing. Seal opened warmers in a plastic bag when not in use and they can be used a couple of more times before being expended.
5,great item @ great price!,I searched several vendors to see who had the best price & this was the best deal! Great product & at a reasonable price.
4,good but not great,"These warmers are good but you might have to use more than one in each glove to keep your hands warm. Also, while they can be reused after an hours use, the effectiveness of the warming diminishes each time you reuse it."
1,Very disappointed,"I work outside. It has been low single digits in Chicago the last few days. I've used other brands in my gloves that I almost had to take off because they were so warm at times. With this brand I couldn't tell if they gave off any heat at all. I kept shaking them but nothing. I bought 10 pair, what a waste."
1,Shortchanged,"Not sure what happened here but when I received my item, the box was open and a couple of packets were missing!"
1,Hot Hands 2,I have used Hot Hands for several years and this last box is faulty. They do not ever get hot. A friend bought a different type and they got hot immediately. A total waste of money.
1,Warning,Beware: These hand warmers contained iron filings large enough for one to get caught like a splinter in my hand. Fearing smaller particles might enter air and reach lungs or affect pets have discontinued use.
4,Fishing warmers,Kept my hands warm in 10 degree weather standing in (and dunking hands in when I got lucky) a river...
4,Best at work,Got for my wife. She uses them in the meat department where she works. Great for keeping her hands warm.
1,Quality Control Issue?,"We use these in ski glove pockets when skiing in cold weather (below 20F). We bought a box last year and they worked great - warmed in about 20 minutes and lasted al day. So we ordered another box this year, same product, and have been very dissapointed. This year's warmers barely warm in an hour and go tepid in glove pockets. They will warm up indoors eventually if left fully exposed to air but that's not useful. We would give last year's warmers 5 stars and this year's version 1 star. There must be a quality control issue. We are returning the box to Amazon (great customer service) and ordering another brand for this ski season."
4,Like magic,"I really like that although this is disposable product, it is natural. I also like that there is a Hothands logo all over it so that it doesn't look like some kind of misplaced, renegade tampon or pad. The only issue I have is that it is bulky. I prefer thinner warmers like the grabber toe warmers but this is a good product too. Also, if you get them wet even just a little bit, they will prematurely and permanently deactivate. I learned that during a break from a winter swim. One drop of water will kill them. Otherwise, they really work 10 hours...These are great, great invention.Contents:Iron powder, water, salt, activated charcoal and vermiculite."
2,Not as great as I thought,"Bought these to help the wife during cold weather, since her hands gets cold very quickly. These warmers do not keep a consistent temp. in a pocket. In cold weather the pouch stays warm for only about a minute then gets cold. If you leave it alone for a long time, the temp goes back up.Get the other brands, not this one."
4,"Works great, but not hot enough","These are great, but tend to cool down too fast. When skiing or snowboarding it is very cold outside, and taking off the glove to ""refresh"" (shake and expose to air) the warmer isn't easy. Moreover, this ""refreshing"" doesn't keep it warm for long enough. I think that these warmers are a must-have when skiing or boarding, and should be in everyone's gloves, but note that although your hands won't be cold, they also won't be warm. Cheers."
3,Its ok..,"After using a friends pair of hand warmers on a cold day I decided to buy some of my own. I took a chance with these hand warmers and they work okay... but don't expect too great of a warmth. Like all hand warmers, they take some time to warm up to the warm temperatures they're known for. Shake it up and let it get exposed to the air. For best results you should keep it in your pockets so you wont loose any heat to the cold. Bring it out for some air and shake it a bit more once in a while. Overall it a decent product... gets the job somewhat done but still leaves your yearning for more."
3,Good for beating back the chill a bit,"Used these as sleeping bag warmers on a week-long chilly camping trip and they did the job. Overnight lows went to just a few degrees above freezing, and these little guys chased the chill out of the sleeping bags before hitting the sack, and were still radiating warmth 7, 8 and even (some days)9 hours later. Do plan ahead - it took a good 30 minutes before they fully warmed up. I wouldn't expect the HeatMax Hot Hands to do a lot without a really thick sleeping bag to trap in the warmth that they radiate - they are pretty small afterall. I alternated using HeatMax and Grabbers on different nights, and found not too much difference in how long they lasted or how much warmth they released. It is puzzling to see how widely the price varies when you shop around - not just a dollar or two - but as much as 40 percent more or less - really wide range of prices for the same thing. Shop around is all I can say."
3,hot hands one half,"these things used to have a lot more heat, dispersed over a shorter time span. now they last forever, or at least 10 hours, but only pump out a little heat and not enough in this northern climate. Maybe they should have more models, say a northern Florida model and an upstate New York model. I have tried doubling up, but there is only so much extra room in my gloves. unless I take my hands out, which sorta defeats the purpose."
1,Worst Hand warmers I have ever used,"Try something else. These barely get warm on a cold day. My hands were left freezing. I have Rynaud's Syndrome, and have used many handwarmers over the years.These are by far the worst I have ever used. Tried several packs from the box of forty. All were worthless. Bought a different brand at Costco and at my local drugstore. Both did the job. Don't waste your money on these."
1,a formerly fantastic product,"I work in the cold and use hand warmers a lot. I've used hot hands for nearly a decade. the last three batches (bought ~4 months apart from different locations) that i've bought have been heatless. This product used to be perfect, but within the past year or so, something has changed. I'll be switching to a different brand. Maybe Grabber as I've read a few promising things."
1,Not so hot,"We ordered these for our trip to Alaska. They did not heat up as advertised. A waste of weight and space. Maybe the altitude on the plane had something to do with it, but they were useless."
2,OK Handwarmers,Not a bad product but not as good as Grabber brand. These do not get as warm nor last as long as Grabber products. For the price they are fine for short period of use. If you want/need warmers that last for more than three hours this should not be your choice.
3,Sub Par Heat,We bought these to put in our chalk bags during our winter climbing trips. These hand warmers took roughly 15 minutes to start registering heat and after that they really didn't get much hotter than body warmth. I'd say at their max heat they were maybe 110F. We'll see how the rest of the packs work out but if the 10 packs we busted open are all representative of the batch we got I'm worried we'll be disappointed.
4,Better than most,"Just got them last week and were put to the ""test"" with the Jan 2013 cold weather on Colorado Mountain Country. I am pleased!"
5,"Great service, great product",Received product in ample time and it is just what I needed/wanted. Will definitely recommend to others and will use them next time. Thanks!!
4,Not big enough,Only thing I have to say is I wish they were twice the size. They are so small in my hand. Heat up very well and very warm.
3,Needs more time to activate!,"Hand warmers are great for sticking in the ski gloves or holding while running outside. These were good - but some of the packages are not as good as others. Maybe they are about to expire? Looked, but nothing on the box. I did notice that compared to single packages I've bought at REI off the shelf, you really need to open them up early and let them activate in the air - much longer than the recommended 20-30 minutes. Once warm, they worked as advertised and stayed warm all day. Every now and then I'd have to pull them out and shake them in the open air to reactivate."
3,Fall apart,I have used these for years to stand watch on a ship for hours in the cold. They really get hot and last all night. The. Last box I got may be defective. Most of the packets tore open at the seams and leaked out a sandlike substance that stained my fingernails black. It remains in my gloves and is difficult to clean out and difficult to remove from under my nails.
3,"Great product, but getting smaller","I've been buying boxes of these handwarmers for years now, mostly for my daughter who has raynaud's. They work fantastically, better than any of the other similar products I've tried, and absolutely do stay warm for the whole working day. However, the most recent shipment I received (december 2012) contained significantly smaller pockets than previous ones. The outer foil packaging was actually larger, with the seal orientation changed so that you have to open each package individually, which I don't mind at all and think it smart so that you don't accidentally open both if you only need one. However, the actual warmer was smaller and flatter, and considering that this most recently box was the most expensive this product's ever been, I'm somewhat disappointed that the company made the choice to cut the size of these handwarmers. Still recommended, but it'll be irksome if it keeps happening."
5,Great bargain,"My husband loves these things, especially for golfing when the weather turns cool. They are so expensive in the stores so online buying works. They were eligible for free shipping but the silly man turned on ""one step"" check out. Make sure you check out the regular way so you can hit the button for free shipping!"
4,"Hot hands was pretty hot, but not as hot as other brands","Not as hot as I have experienced with other similar products, but for the price it is a good buy."
1,poor performance,i purchased this item after reading all the specific details which convinced me to buy. my first thought was that my hands would be warm this winter. i purchased a box and i have tried several times to use them and the same results were not that good. the only time they get hot is inside your home. i will not purchase again.
1,Not worth the money,Very un happy with this product. does not get warm enough to keep my hands warm. Would not recommend this product nor would I purchase it again. Not worth the cost of shipping back.
5,Damn fine music,"Why is this not available on CD? I don't have a tape player in my truck, and I want this on CD so I can play it there. Someone release this on CD? Please? I'll buy it like a shot if you do."
3,Smokey Soundtrack,"It has all the great CB bits on it, but there are a lot of songs that I could have done without ""The Bandit"" song 3 times."
1,Disappointed in tape quality,"I bought this tape for a friend of mine. They played it once and it ""unravelled"" and couldn't be used again."
1,Sound quality is poor,"The CD does say ""These historic performances, though not of the highest sound quality, were deemed worthy of being digitally mastered on compact disk in order to preserve these authentic renditions."" All true but buy Pete Seeger, ""We shall overcome""The complete Carnegie Hall Concert instead.I bought the Folk Music of the World CD because I have a complete collection of Seeger's work."
2,I should have listened to the other reviewers,"I purchased this miter box because I needed the 30 degree cut for a dollhouse I am building. I wanted something inexpensive as I will probably never us it again.Well, the other reviewer was correct, even my thinnest razor blade saw will not fit in the 30 degree slots. The blade is so tight within the slots that it will not move to cut the wood.Guess I'll keep looking."
1,Worthless,This product is worthless in application. The slots are to narrow for both my razor and the thinnest of wood saws. Pins do not stay in place. Look elsewhere to avoid disappointment.
3,Not what it says!,I needed a miter box for a 2 1/2 board.. this does not take it.. it has a max size of 2 in... After rereading I see it does say that in the desc.. still its useless to me.
4,Selective research does not produce accurate history,"The author did significant archival research but no field investigation for this massive volume. This oversight, deliberate or otherwise caused a number of ridiculous errors relating to Mt. McKinley. He also ignored other pertinent data of explorers, historians and mountaineers who did not agree with him. See 1996 edition of ""To the Top of the Continent."" and 1994-96 ""Polar Priorities&quot"
4,Feet relief,Its great but the only vice is that it slides off my feet. I have to constantly adjust it. It does make it more comfortable but the adjusting part is annoying.
2,Not sized correctly,I bought the size for men with shoe size 11 but it is too loose. Even with socks over the cushion it slips towards the front of my foot when I walk and makes it less effective.
5,Immediate pain relief!,"I have tried several cushions to relieve plantar pain and this product is the only one to not only provide immediate relief, but sustained relief. They work great with stockings, socks, and tights. Don't slip and am buying more."
2,They don't stay put.,"I have Morton's Neuroma. These are a bit flimsy, they want to slip and slide out of place. Course I don't wear a tight shoe, that could be why"
3,it was okay.,"The book was good. Yet some parts of the book were corny and really melodramatic. For example, when Lindsay cut off and dyed her hair. Also, it was sort of hard to believe that Daniel was a male... he acted feminine. His character had the personality of a gay boy. He noticed EVERYTHING, which is a female trait. Other than that, the book was an interesting read."
1,A ripoff and an unreliable piece of junk!,"Don't believe the hype that this item is Mac compatable. After carefully following the mfr's installation and operation instructions to the letter, the item suddenly disappeared from the desktop. It won't mount on MacOS 10.3.5 nor on MacOS 9.2.2. Nor will it be recognized by the Disk Utilities included with these MacOSs and Symmantec/Norton SystemWorks.This external drive is a ripoff and an unreliable piece of junk."
3,Delicate glass,"Great product for aerating wine, however the stem broke where you attach it to the wine bottle."
5,Vinoglobe Wine Aerator,"I love this product! It works extremely well and does ""open"" up the wine. The Vinoglobe fits all of the wine bottles that I have used it with. In some cases you do have to be a bit careful inserting the decanter or there is the chance the glass may crack. I plan on giving these as gift as I think it is a very good product."
5,On Bottle Decanter is Magic,I ordered the On Bottle Decanter after watching it featured on a iTunes podcast. I got my order for 2; I kept one and mailed the other to my son. I can honestly say as a casual wine consumer that this simple device dramatically improved the taste of a moderately priced cab I like to drink. It is very simple but profound in effect. Great price and makes a great gift.MR
3,The Good Old Days,"This collection is just what they describe... Midnight Classics.The good old days of overacting and crazy ideas that were a risk back in the 60's. If you like the old movies, this is a great purchase. Break out the popcorn and soda. Turn out the lights and if there's a knock at the door, don't answer it... you could be next! The kids will get a kick out of this collection also."
4,Helpful tool,"What a helpful tool for the very young. It's hard enough to know what to say to other adults, let alone to children. This is a very helpful resource."
4,Decent,"It was what I expect. Great purchase for the price. I wish the cover was not as bent as it was, but still glad I was able to buy it for what I needed."
1,A Sad Example,"As a psychotherapist, I got this book to work with children who were struggling through divorce. This book normalized and legitimized divorce. It at no time emphasized adult problem solving nor that marriage is a contract of two consenting adults through good and bad.Children are misled to believe they can identify a short term resolution of the horrible feelings of divorce (by a child). As a therapist it is always a lifelong scarring that is not resolved.Indeed the first 11 year old girl I read this with, remarked that it made no sense and at no time was realistic to the process she had gone through years earlier. A sad example of political correctness run amok."
3,Koko Bear,I was disappointed at the length of the book and my elementary school clients got bored with the book quickly.
4,Good book for older children and divorce,"I read this to myself a few times..it seems good for older children,not sure if it's for my 3 y/o twins but I like the message anyways"
4,divorce & kids,"Breaking up is hard to do, especially if it involves parents, kids, and divorce. Delightful illustrations, clearly scripted dialogues, and parental education gives this book an A at helping younger children understand that divorce is not their fault. As a psychotherpist, I highly recommend it for divorcing parents."
2,Not so great for preschoolers...better for ages 7 to 10,"I bought this book because of the recommendations, but I find it far to wordy and deep for my preschoolers. On every spread, the left page is entirely text (multiple paragraphs), and the right page is an illustration. I think this book is probably better suited to 7-10 year-olds than to preschoolers. For 3-5 year-olds, instead of this book, I recommend ""Standing on my own two feet"" by Schmitz and ""Two Homes"" by Masurel."
2,unrealistic,"I read the book to my two children and they simply looked at me and said ...""bears don't get divorced!"" I think it is unrealistic and they're aren't any coping tools to resolve issues the PARENTS often create for the children after divorce or separation. It is cute but they seemed to have a hard time identifying with bears getting divorced."
4,Works Good,...when you make the time to use it and follow the directions...this will probably be part of my post golf routine for a long time...
3,Flexbar,Grossly over priced for what it is. Like any exercise product you get out of it what you put in.
4,Portable training,The advantage of the Thera-band is that it's small and portable. I can throw it in my suitcase when travelling. I use it for strength training and therapeutically for stretching.
4,Flex-bar is great,"I purchased the flex bar for my 81 year old husband. He has chemo-induced neuropathy in his hands, The therapist recommended this to build up the muscles and he now has 75% usage and is again able to write and do all the crafts he loves."
3,FLEXBAR heavy model (25 pounds),"I purchased this brand and model to compare against the Cando twist-n-bend, which is a very similar product. The Thera-Band Company makes quality products and some of them are designed for very fit individuals. However, the Flexbar heavy model is not a product for a person of even moderate strength. It is far to easy to twist and bend this model to get a decent workout. The Flexbar heavy, medium, and light models are better suited for people going through rehabilitation, those that lack upper body strength, and teenagers whose muscles have not fully developed. Although the material ingredients are a little bit better quality than the Cando twist-n-bend, the Cando extra heavy model, which Thera-band does not have a similar model, is designed for strong athletes, martial artists, boxer, wrestlers, bouncers and many others. The Cando model is also cheaper.I should have spent my money on another Cando twist-n-bend instead of the Flexbar."
4,Great Tool To Assist Recovery,This device ( I used the green level) has made a significant difference in my recovery from tennis elbow. It allowed me to effectively stretch and strengthen the extensor muscle/tendon complex in a gentle and progressive way. I started this after two weeks complete rest and ice to the affected area. I would strongly recommend the Thera-band Flexbar.
5,Great for tennis elbow,"Bought the blue/heavy one and did the twist and release exercise. Of course it is hard to tell if just this has made by tennis elbow better as I took a lot of rest too, but after using it a few weeks my arm is a lot better. It's for sure worth the try. The best is after your arm is better is to focus on hitting a clean ball. I think especially bad serving and framing backhands are the source for tennis elbow...if you play tennis of course."
4,Fizically Fit,Love this company and there products. I a corrective exercise specialist and personal trainer. this company has it all. little on shipping
1,"Worse, not better!","I was progressing nicely using simple therapy. I tried the Thera-Band, and got worse. When I mentioned this to my orthopedic specialist, he agreed this product is more hype than help. Don't waste your money like I did!"
2,It's too thick...,"I bought the heavy flexbar to use with my exercises to help cure my tennis elbow. Unfortunatly, it is way too thick for me to grip it comfortably. The diameter is 1 and 7/8 inches (too bad this data wasn't included with all the other information they show). I suspect that the medium one would work better."
2,exercises not too easy to do properly and the green one is too easy,The softest one (green one) is way too easy to bend for an adult man or woman--maybe it is useful for someone who is terribly injured. Even my 7 year old boys find it too easy too play with. The others are ok but I found the description of the exercises recommended a bit short of my expectations. I had difficulty figuring the movements from one position to another.
5,"Good for tennis elbow, Chiropractor's review","Some recent research has shown that flexion of the wrist extensors while being eccentrically contracted, will accelerate the healing of this repetitive injury. If you have tennis elbow, this is the first thing I would do. I have had success so far with using this for treatment. Beware, the exercise must be done exactly correct, and is easily done incorrectly. see the youtube video. search tennis elbow flexbar. the muscles should be lengthening while contracting. A good thing would be to buy one and bring it to your chiropractor or physical therapist, have them look up the video and do proper instruction. Our practice is Healing Hands Chiropractic in Gulfport MS.[...]."
2,Tennis elbow treatment,"The Thera-Band flexbar is supposed to be the magic cure for tennis elbow, but I saw limited progress doing the exercise described on several sites. Others I know personally say it helped them though. Either way, I found the red bar to be too little resistance and changed to the blue. I'm guessing the green is right for most people."
3,Slow results,"With a limited us of this product, 3 weeks, there have been little or no results in helping the elbow pain that was mentioned in Reader's Digest to help with tennis elbow. I'll give it a few more months."
5,After a couple of days my tennis elbow was gone,Odd as the exercise sounds and as odd as the simple device seems to be. It worked. Within 3 days i was no longer hurting from tennis elbow. Keep doing the exercises though. Don't make the mistake of stopping just as soon as the pain goes away. Later on if you think it is coming back than go do those exercises again. So glad my boss told me about it.
4,I read the NT Times Article,I read the NY Times article citing the thera band bar as a solution for tennis elbow and tendonitis. It works and I have strengthened my muscles around that area and the pain is gone. Amazing!
4,Great product,I was using this flexbar when i was going to my physical therapy and found it for way cheaper at amazon. Its great to strengthen the muscles on your forearms and wrist.
4,Choose Color Carefully,"Good product. I'm using it to heal tennis elbow and it is a big help. Make sure, however, you select the right tension for your intended use. For tennis elbow therapy you pre-twist the bar and then release the twist with your hurt arm. The blue bar is very stiff and challenging to twist. It would likely be painful for a moderate to severe case of tennis elbow. I suggest the red or green bar for tennis elbow. For strength building by bending the bar, the blue is challenging but fine. For reference I am a 48 year old male, 6'3"", in good shape, who plays competitive tennis 5 times a week. I hope this is helpful."
4,Like it,The Green version was the right size and strength. I'm noticing an improvement in my tennis elbow after only a week of using the flex bar.
2,Be Careful- Don't Make it Worse,"This exercise might be OK for people who have a really mild touch of self-diagnosed tennis elbow. If you have it really bad (like I did), I don't think this is the miracle cure you want it to be. The thing is, it hurts to do the exercise, and not in a good way. It doesn't work your muscles like in strength training, it seems to just strain the tendon, triggering more tennis elbow pain. For me it feels like someone's poking a pin into the bony part of my elbow. I'm seeing a physical therapist who says that you shouldn't do anything that makes it hurt more. She doesn't seem to have a high opinion of this Flexbar exercise, which I mentioned, and this is a pretty well-respected physical therapy place. She's having me do stretching and strengthening exercises that are so mild they almost feel like nothing.The bar itself only cost $12 or so but now what do I do with it? Use it to hold up the window? As a dog toy?"
4,Thera-Band Flexbar Exerciser,"I was looking for something to use for upper body and arm exercise without having to go to a gym. I found it with the Flexbar, and have found it to be very effective."
5,Easy to use,I keep mine on my desk and pick it up from time to time throughout the day. This is one exercise that gets done because it is so convenient.
5,It really works for tendinitis!!,I had recurring tendonitis in my right elbow. I've been using these bars to do the Tyler Twist (look up this exercise online - there's a good article in the New York Times about it). Started out with the red bar and worked up to the green bar. As far as I'm concerned these bars have completely cured my tendonitis. I still use them to keep up the strength in my arms and prevent the tendonitis from coming back.
3,Provides some relief,I have used the band off and on for a few months. It does provide some relief for tennis elbow. If i used it more consistently perhaps I would have had a better result.
5,Simple but amazingly effective tool for tennis elbow,Used this to help rehab my elbows after putting some strain on them due to heavy weight-lifting. This thing works like a charm. Really helped out a lot on the road to recovery.
4,Thera-Band Flexbar Incredible healing experience,"This Flexbar was introduced to me at my Physical Therapist office for my Tennis Elbow, (lateral epicondilytis ). 6 weeks of PT and exercises, which the healing process just starts. It takes 3 mos to 6 mos for a complete heal, from what my PT had informed me. Definite a good buy, I had bought a green flexbar instead of red, due to I weight lift and exercise regularly. Immediately the strength & heal comes back into your forearm elbow and hand.Next 3 to 6 mos will have much better results along with all my other exercises, that I have incorporated into my daily life & healing process.The shipping process took 2 1/2 weeks or more for my home delivery, that was the only downfall. Well worth the wait in the long wrong, price was right."
5,tendonitis review,A friend had introduced me to this exerciser as a way to relieve pain from chronic Tennis Elbow ( tendonitis) Using this daily I have seen improvements.
3,Doesn't seem to work,I still have tennis elbow after 5 months of therapy and doctor treatment. An ortho told me that there are different views on this condition and it can take up to two years to go away. Might work for some.
4,it helped,"Bought it for tennis elbow problems, came with a good instruction booklet, I used it regularly and it seems like it's doing what it's suppose to: strengthening the muscles in the forearm. I would recommend it for tennis elbow problems."
2,Way to expensive for what it is,Works as specified but like all their products it is insanely overpriced. It's just a cut-off piece of rubber bar and their other products are just strips of rubber sheet. Amazing they get away with it.
4,"Wimpy, but nice.","I purchased the heavy version of the Thera-Band Flexbar to do exercises to treat tennis elbow. It is very pliable and soft and surprisingly wimpy in the resistance category. I am in pretty good shape but not especially beefy or muscular. I didn't notice if there was a extra heavy version when purchasing it, but would recommend that version, if available, for such purposes."
4,Tennis elbow,I use the theraband flex bar every day at work. Three months agopain was gradully worse and was losing sleep at night with throbbing pains in the elbow and forarm. Icing arm at work and at home 2 to 4 trimes a day.After the theraband flex bar for 3 weeks the pain is geadually less.I use ice ocassionally at work and sometimes in the night. I also have had 2 cortisone shots in the elbow.I know the problem came on slowly over a lone time but with continued use if the Flexbay and occaional icing I am getting better.
1,Overated solution for tennis elbow.,"Ridiculous solution when much simpler ways exist. Total marketing hype. Much easier, safer and more contolled ways to achieve results. Oh well."
3,Thera-Band Flexbar,"Thus far I am happy with the product and with the variety of exercises one can do with it. However, I purchased it to help heal and prevent ""tennis elbow"" and since I have not played for a couple of months (winter weather), I will not know the final results until sometime this summer."
2,Theraband Review,"I purchased this Theraband as a new item, but it appeard to be used. I paid about $15 for it. My physical therapist said a new one cost about $30. It didn't have the firmer flexibility that I expected it to and it was worn/frayed a bit on one end. I am still using it, and probably would have bought the cheaper version used if it had been advertised as such. Not happy that it was not new."
4,You'll Never Know,"THE THERA BARS WORKED VERY WELL IN REHABING MY RIGTH ELBOW.. UNFORTUNATELY I BROKE MY LEFT ARM IN TWO PLACES, AND MY SORE RIGHT ELBOW HAS HAD TO TAKE UP THE SLACK (so its worse now) YOU CAN'T WIN!!!GOT ANY THING FOR A BROKEN ARM???? I ONLY GAVE YOU 4 STARS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO USE THE BARS. TA TA. KRISTY"
4,"Good, just don't overdo it.","I have medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow) in both elbows. The physical therapist had me use one of these one day and I worked on it doing various exercises for about 20 minutes straight. Had a big flare-up after that which took me weeks to recover from. However, I'd already bought one online and when it came and I was feeling a bit better I would pick it up for 5 minutes here and there, no more than 5 minutes any given day. It seems to work the muscles well without putting undo strain on the tendons, as long as you don't go nutty on it right off the bat."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I bought the CD since I was looking for ""Rorate"" which is performed beautifully on this CD as are a number of other tracks. My husband and I both thought the CD was not very festive and found some of the original compositions to be slow and lackluster especially the second track, ""New Prince, New Pomp"". It did not put us in the Christmas spirit as we were driving many miles for the holidays...was rather dull. Overall, I was disappointed with the CD."
4,"Nice distro, good hardware support","I moved to Mandrake from RedHat because Mandrake supported a device I had that RedHat did not. This is a nice distro for users new to Linux because it's fairly friendly to install and is one of the best at having built in support for newer hardware. Mandrake also has two community tech support lists that are very active, and their programmers participate regularly. The PowerPack has some nice extras to play with, like ViaVoice and Arkeia network backup software. It seems to install well on a variety of machines. I'm very pleased with its ease of installation and its performance."
3,"Not a review, a warning...","This is not a review of Mandrake 7.2, but a warning... The Macmillan Publishing version ... is actually the last Beta version of Mandrake 7.2, not the final product. One of the unpleasant side-effect is that it include KDE 2 Beta, while the final release of Mandrake 7.2 comes with KDE 2 Final...The Mandrakesoft version is the ""real"" Mandrake 7.2 final, but i'm not sure if it is available in the USA..."
1,If you think you want linux: read this,I never got farther than the installation program. It made about 1.5 gigs on my computer unusable. I eventually stoped the installer because I had no idea what it was doing. Don't buy this unless you have a good lawyer...
3,Shania,This is a very informative book on the history of shania and her family. It tells the story of her troubled past and all the hardships she had to overcome in order to be the person she is today. The book is a little outdated and will not cover much of her life after about 1998-99. Overall this is a great book to learn about the life of one of the greatest cross-over country singers in history.
3,Not My Kinda Biography,"I love Shania, and this book has some great information about her life, and the experiences that shaped her. The problem is that the author's ""extensive research"" consists of reading every magazine article ever written about Shania, which the author has to acknowledge every time he quotes one. That means that almost every paragraph in the book contains a sentence like, ""As she said in the May 1998 issue of Canadian Country Music Disgest..."". I found this aspect of the book very annoying! If not for my interest in Shania, I wouldn't have had the stamina to finish this book."
5,a joy of a book,"This is one of my three favorite bread books , along with Carole Field's superb The Italian Baker and the magnificent French professional Baking Series books. Mr. Ortiz imparts his great knowledge with both simplicity and style. The recipes are clear, to the point and reliable. In a word they work and work beautifully. The details about the various village bakers, particularly in France and Italy impart extremely well Mr. Ortiz joyous passion for bread. It is a definite basic authority and a joy of a bread book to own. A word of caution: at least in my edition I have found two places where the quantities from commercial to home recipes are in error- check the olive oil bath for the pizza dough and reduce to the commercial proportion rather than that given for the home sized quantity. There is an erroneous smount of salt in another recipe (too much)"
4,worked for me,I'm sure I'm a novice but the bread I baked from this book was great .I tried three recipes and was hooked !!! My famliy and friends begged for more . Now if amazon just carried it (mine came from the library)
4,Some reservations ...,"This book is certainly a very knowledgeable book and I quite agree with some of the reviews by other readers. However, comparing this to some other bread books now available in the market, I find this one rather complicated and difficult to follow. One reason is its format. When I use some of the recipes there, I have to frequently go through some of the pages before or after. This makes the whole process a bit troublesome. On the other hand, speaking about the recipes I have tried, they are not really that superior and that is why I have some reservations towards the merit of the book. It does not seem to be worth that trouble. However, I do appreciate the efforts the author spend to share those researches with the readers. I think the book is not for the beginners and it takes quite some time to follow the formulas."
3,My what a big tool you have!,"Okay, I'm a professional computer geek and an amateur artist. The artist bit has had me carrying a pocket knife as a money clip for years, but now I need to carry a little screw drivers and such for work.I was hoping this would replace my knife/money clip and add a bit driver but I didn't realize how large and heavy this thing is! It's nearly an inch thick and is probably nearing 2/3 lb on its own. That's a lot to carry around in your pocket all the time.Beyond that tho, the knife is strong and sharp, the bit drivers are very functional & with the addition of the $10 bit kit from leatherman, I was able to choose the bits I need.It's definitely a well made tool. Just bulky and heavy."
1,Disappointing!,"I used to buy 108 pencils from ""Bic Stationary"" for about $22. Now, somehow, they're charging $33 for only 18 more?!Ridiculous!As far as pencils go, these are fine. But the price increase is insane."
2,A struggle to read.,"Ms Barr's writing style is unique, but not in a good way. It is difficult to follow a murder mystery when it seems the author just continues to throw ancillary prose in the way. In the first three books I have read by her, extremely little detective work is done by Anna Pigeon, Law Enforcement Officer. It is like Ms Barr never diagrammed her way from dead body to murder arrest. Nothing goes in a straight line in these novels. Lots and lots of mental gymnastics by Pigeon but nothing helpful in solving the mystery. I'm not sure why this series exists other than to shallowly showcase a few national parks."
3,Anna Pigeon survives again,Once again the reader finds Anna in many dangerous situations. She always figures out how to win against evil. This book made me feel good.
2,Anna Pigeon,"Not very fond of Anna! She has issues that are not fully explained, that would help you understand her better. A bit one dimensional, Crimes are pretty lame, too. Just not much there."
2,Too Coincidental and Dumb,I felt that this book was much too coincedental and the wrap up at the end left me laughing for how stupid it was. I did not like it.
4,Lake Superior gives up some secrets,"""Superior Death"" by Nevada Barr, 1994Ms. Barr always writes a good story, placed in various national parks. These are not the normal parks like Yellowstone or Yosemite, but little traveled ones that get their share of visitors, but not a lot of press. Usually she has a map included, this is the first that did not have one.The story was sad, people got killed and abused, but really easy to read and interesting. Her stories are more on the lines of suspense/mystery, rather then just mystery, and emphasis on the suspense. This does get a bit expectable and, while exciting, you know she will get away and fight another day.It is also another example of the sleuth who is not a detective. I have read one of a state game warden and a caterer, as well as this national park ranger."
4,A Superior Book,"Compared to Track of the Cat, the first in the Anna Pigeon series, A Superior Death is a pulitzer winner. Cat was transparent in plot and the characters were thin and unlikeable. Superior has a much more complex plot and a true murder *mystery*. Anna now makes sensible conclusions, unlike Cat where her thoughts were silly. The character has much more depth, and starts to be somewhat likeable (she gets even better in Ill Wind). Sister Molly is still pretty awful, and not really used to her potential. As always, the vivid picture of the national park in question, this time Isle Royale, is spectacular. With the second in the series, it now makes sense why it has become so popular."
3,"Disappointed in the characters, good mystery and setting...","I have had many recommendations to read this book and so I purchased three of Nevada Barr's mysteries. I love the national park settings and enjoy the park as an important part of the story. The murder is intriguing and its solution quite good. However, I'm disappointed in the morals of the characters and the independent choices they make during the course of the story. There isn't much about Nevada Barr's character that I really like...except that she is a gutsy woman ranger who finds herself in the middle of a mystery to solve."
3,"Defies common sense, but exciting nonetheless","This is the second installment of the Anna Pigeon series, and it is better than Track of the Cat. Being a diver, I particularly enjoyed the scuba diving aspect of the story, but I'm not convinced that any diver worth his/her salt would dive alone, at night, in frigid water, 200 feet down, on an unfamiliar wreck regardless of how ""necessary"" it may be. Even if a diver would do that, it would NEVER be alone if s/he intended to end the dive alive. It did make for higher level of excitement, though.As far as detective series go, Barr's books are more complex than many out there. Murder mysteries are by nature formulaic, and Barr does a good job of fleshing out the characters, tying the layers of the story together, and concluding in a satisfying way."
4,in vino veritas,"I have read the entire Anna Pigeon series once already. This time I am reading them in order. I really enjoy this book because Ms Barr provides such accurate insight to NPS inner workings. I have known people who have worked for NPS and know people much like Tinker and Damien, who seem drawn to this kind of work. I love the intertwined story lines between Anna and her sister, Molly. In my copy are several typos where Holly is spelled 'Molly' and it was a bit confusing but I straightened it all out. I feel the cold of the lake and although most of the books in this series feel dark to me, I still am captivated by the descriptive prose. And the twisty ending is great (no hints)!"
5,Underwater Terror,"If you have a major fear of water, don't go near Nevada Barr's A SUPERIOR DEATH. The seconded of the Anna Pigeon takes you to the murky bottom of Lake Superior in a thriller guaranteed to rattle your bones. Anna has been transferred from the dry Texas hill county to a little known national park on the shores of our largest fresh water lake with murder following her.The park people are sceptical of her and her innate curiosity that demands a personal exploration of a famous shipwreck. Mystery--suspense--thrills in unusual environments are becoming a trademark for Ms. Barr.Don't miss a page of the excellent story.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
5,Tock Tick - Beyond Words,"I found this single to be an amazing spoken/rythmic blend. It's as if Vonnegut's words are completed by the music, merging into it and becoming a single entity. The music is emotive and pulls in the listener. I didn't think a spoken word recording could do this. I've always loved Vonnegut's work but never experienced it like this. I want more!!"
3,Great Fights but needs More,All of the Fights on this Disc are amazing. The fact that there is only 6 fights left me wanting more. The WEC had so many incredible fights that limiting it to 6 seems like a mockery.It would be great if there was an opportunity to buy the complete events or if more fights were offered.Worth buying but 6 fights is just not enough....
5,This is the original record version from 1975,"Not the fragmented cue-track version. And I share bossrock's preference for this version. My favorite passage is the second part of PREPARING THE CAGE. It sounds like the musical equivalent of suspended animation.There's a recurrent string chord that runs thru JAWS. A single sustained chord. With an off-kilter feel. Due to the presence of the dissonant violas. It sounds like the violas are playing a descending second to the tonic violins. Or something like that. Well in any case, PREPARING THE CAGE contains the best use of that chord.Bram Janssen said: ""Could one compare it with STAR WARS or RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK? I think one would better compare it with THE SUGARLAND EXPRESS and THE COWBOYS.""This is a profound truth. Williams wrote JAWS shortly before his soul got possessed by the malevolent ghost of Richard Strauss."
2,"Rather outdated--not bad, though","I'm fourteen years old, and have been programming computer games for three years now. I bought this book because it looked interesting. It is...however, the material is horribly out-of-date; there is no info on Mode-X, PCX files, or even double buffering. In one chapter, Marmelstein says: ""Using floodfill() is slightly faster than large numbers of putpixel() instructions."" I don't think so, Tim. However, all in all, it's not a bad book. It comes with a disk containing four example games, which aren't all that bad, though VERY crude (sorry, but they are). Some 3D info is provided, though not nearly enough to design a playable 3D shoot-'em-up. There is an example flight simulator on the disk, but is EXTEMELY clunky and primitive. Also, the example programs all require Microsoft C to compile...I use DJGPP, so that's a minor pain in the rear. What I think? You'd probably be much better off with PC Game Programming Explorer or Action Arcade Adventure Set."
1,Much better books out there,"If this book came out in, say, 1991 the quality would be acceptable. But it didn't! It came out in 1995, the same year the excellent Black Art of 3D Game Programming came out. Don't buy this one! It's not worth it!"
2,'tis ok but definately outdated,This book is a good source for those of you wanting to learn how to progam games in the C programming language. Please be advised that the book is outdated in our opinion. It does however give you a good headstart...
4,Makes a beatiful gift for cooks,"I bought this book in Canada, so my cover is different, but I bought this version for my mother in law and it was the same inside as mine. The pictures are gorgeous, and the recipes are good too. This book is definitely for people who enjoy canning, preserving and so on. I have used several recipes with success and every few months I pull the book out just to look at the pictures."
5,Beautiful book!,This book is great for someone wanting to create beautiful gifts from their kitchen and/or garden. The photographs are very inspiring!
2,Works pretty well once it boots,"Constantly have to re-boot it after booting my computer. Crashes and has to be re-booted during use. Very much a pain. Other than that it looks nice and has a very cool blue lighting and when it works, it works well."
4,NIce,"It is a nice inexpensive Jersey, A little thin, but for the price It was a good deal, and it was a little hard to find elsewhere"
3,Melancholy ending!,"I love Robert Parker's writing style, and I really enjoyed reading this book. But while I agree with all of the positivecomments other reviewers have already made, I was deeply disappointed by the lack of a good ending. There were some great dramatic possibilities left hanging on the vine. A detective assures Sunny everything will fall into place and the story ends. This isn't the first time Parker has shortchanged his readers. What's the deal with that?"
4,Sunny Randall Better than Ever,After a disappointing Shrink Rap. I thought I would never read a another Sunny Randall novel. But boy was I wrong. This is excellent. The plot was the character Sarah hiring Sunny to find her real parents. But that is when the trouble begins. Someone is out to silent them both. The question remains is Sarah's parents her real parents? Who are they? Why are out to get them? If you are looking for a good Sunny Randall novel this is it? Besides Sunny get rid of some of her hidden demons.
3,new character shows promise,"In his non-Spenser novels Parker is showing an increasing interest in his characters' emotional vulnerability. His female PI Sunny Randall gets involved with a mysterious case in which a young woman named Sarah hires Sunny to find her real parents. The man and woman Sarah lives with insist THEY are her real parents... trouble ensues....At the same time, Sunny is seeing a shrink (Spenser's girlfriend Susan) to deal with her feelings about the remarriage of ex-husband Richie. Sunny, like Jesse Stone in another Parker series, is interesting because she doesn't have everything figured out, and (although I never would have imagined it) Parker quite ably gets inside the head of this bright young woman. The mystery is of middling interest and the supporting characters are pale versions of characters from the Spenser book, but Parker's humor and love of atmosphere carry the day ....recommended...."
4,Hawk Down,Another great Spenser novel. U nflappable Hawk being in rerhab this time. Therevenge is typically Parker; well written and compelling. Parker is always a great read.
5,Robert Parker Sunny Randall series,Love the Sunny Randall series. Easy and fun to read. This is the fourth book in the series.
2,Parker seems to have lost his fastball,"For Spenser and Parker fans, this latest effort is a bit dissapointing.The plot seems to drag, none of the characters are a bit likeable, and there are some scenes where you can't help but picture Spenser in a skirt (Ugh).Parker's writing is a bit too formulaic for him to make the jump from a tough-guy detective novel to a tough-woman detective novel....the characters are too similar."
3,"A fast-moving tale tinged with, well... melancholy","Another enjoyable Robert Parker thriller with an interesting twist: Susan Silverman, the lady love of Mr. Parker's other detective hero, Spenser, is featured here as protagonist Sunny Randall's new psychiatrist. The book isn't wildly entertaining, but so what? Both the mystery plot and the personal subplot- about Sunny attempting to deal with her ex-husband's recent re-marriage- are credible, interesting and compelling, and in the end further cement Mr. Parker's reputation for always delivering a reliably good read."
5,Surprisingly great debut,This really is a fantastic CD. There's a pretty major Kinks (circa Something Else)influence hanging over Kind of Light and the lead singer can sound eerily like Ray Davies at times. It'll be a shame if it gets lost in the shuffle due to lack of publicity. Possibly one of the best of 2003.
4,Debut of 88 is a fine place to start!,"This is a band i ended up stumbling into via the hey-day of BMG and got their third album because it was somewhat a hit mainstream-wise. Fastforward to going to see Ray Davies, where this band opened for him and then played as his backing band and it re-opened my eyes and ears to giving these guys more of a look.If you like the Kinks or Jellyfish you will dig on this band pretty well. This album for a debut has some really killer tunes on it AND one could actually argue, it *might* be the best album they've made.(for the record though, they're ALL worth picking up!)"
1,Very Poor choice for Beginners or Intermediates,"I got the book for a course I was taking in my masters program. I had taken one Linear Systems course in my undergraduate. While I bought the book new, it didn't make it through HALF of the semester before the binding broke and pages fell out. The book omits many useful proofs, and if it doesn't omit the proof, it expects you to figure out on your own with very little prompting. It does have some useful examples but assumes the reader has a VERY broad and deep understanding about linear algebra and calculus. It's very high level and often difficult to follow."
3,Not too great for self study....,"This was the prescribed book for a Linear Systems course I took. The author believes in discovering various facets of the subject through the exercise problems. As a result, it is not the best book to be used for self study. Also, continuous and discrete systems are treated independently of each other, so one has to keep turning the pages back to understand various analogies. The book by Antsaklis/ Michel is a better choice. Being taught by a good instructor however does offset some of the problems. Another irritating point was the poor quality of the bind. I had pages coming out two months into the semester :("
1,Whatever...,"Kailath's System Theory essentially rejected Chen's Linear System Theory for its undue emphasis on computation of the matrix exp. and other crimes. Kailath in turn beat realization theory to death, and is now rejected by Rugh. Well, this is but a better organized rewrite and update of Brockett's 1969 book. While that was easy to learn from, this one is not. In fact no current text on system theory is easy to learn from, save Luenberger's which is too watered down anyway. The student is as usuall left to his own devices. Good luck."
5,Better than Jack Johnson,"This CD has the cool summer vibe sound all over it. It's one of those CD's you put in as you sit on your front porch drinking double Southern Comfort and ice teas, or Corona, or whatever whatever. The voice is superb and the sound is along the lines of Ben Harper without the Fun Lovin Criminals and Jack Johnson, except it is more entertaining...whoa! If you like to chill out in the summer BUY THIS CD."
3,"If you only have one Mamas/Papas album, this is it","Music of my youth. If you like 60s/70s pop you'll like this; pop is not my favorite genre, but Ms&Ps were probably the best at it and I like this album. The quartet has a nice tight sound. Cass Elliot (RIP) had a remarkable pop voice, though IMO not a truly great one; if her obesity hadn't taken her down via heart attack before she even turned 33, it might have developed into a fantastic voice. She has a few solos on this album. Album includes two of their probably most famous cuts (and my favorites of theirs), ""California Dreamin'"" and ""Monday Monday"". Worth your listening time; I went out of my way to buy it again after my first copy was stolen."
4,"The ""soundtrack"" of a generation","As I sat at work on another ""MONDAY, MONDAY,"" I started to ""LOOK THROUGH MY WINDOW, thinking about how ""I SAW HER AGAIN LAST NIGHT."" I decided to compose a little poem ""DEDICATED TO THE ONE I LOVE."" It was easy to create ""WORDS OF LOVE"" as I told the pen to ""GO WHERE YOU WANNA GO.""I sent it special delivery to ""MY GIRL"" who began to ""TWIST AND SHOUT"" with glee upon receipt of the testimony to our love. She hurried to my apartment without making a single ""TRIP, STUMBLE, & FALL.""So elated were we that we decided to go ""DANCING IN THE STREET.""Then I awoke from my slumbers, looked over at her to which she responded, ""Did you ""DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME""?So, I didn't use all sixteen. Buy the CD and enjoy the songs and the memories."
1,dont get me wrong!,"This particular compilation is the reason that The Mamas and the Papas 2nd album has never been released on C.D! The Mamas and the Papas released 4 albums originally (not including ""Live at Monterey Pop"" or ""people Like Us""). They were>(1) ""If you can belive your eyes and ears""(2)""Cass,John,Dennie,Michelle-A.k.A self titled""(3)""Deliver""(4)""The Papas and The Mamas"". Now, their 2nd album Cass,John,Etc. (self titled) was never released on cd because the picture on this compilation was originally the picture of their 2nd album except on the top border of the original their names appear in red letters and it doesn't say ""20 greatest hits"" on it. MCA made a bad call and decided to use the cover picture of the original second for a compilation probably never thinking that the original albums were ever going to be released on cd. the other 3 are on cd, have been for years, Live at monterey and people like us are also on cd."
5,"Effective compilation of hits, greatest and others","This is a great Mamas & Papas compilation, perhaps the best. I always liked the album jacket photos better than the one on the CD release.Released in 1969 on Dunhill/ABC Records, DS 50064. The album release has a slightly different program and sequencing than the CD.Side 1: ""California Dreamin',"" ""Dedicated To the One I Love,"" ""I Call Your Name,"" ""Twelve-Thirty,"" ""Creeque Alley,"" ""Dancing In the Street,"" ""For the Love Of Ivy,"" ""Go Where You Wanna Go.""Side 2: ""My Girl,"" ""Look Through My Window,"" ""Words of Love,"" ""Twist and Shout,"" ""I Saw Her Again,"" ""Dream a Little Dream Of Me,"" ""Trip, Stumble, and Fall,"" ""Monday, Monday."""
4,Lost excellence,"Amazing how fresh the music still sounds. Remastering helps, I'm sure, but the purity of the voices and imaginitive arrangements seems current. Only 2-3 songs may be heard on the radio so it's great to get the others."
2,Interesting personal account of the CW in the East.,"Having read half of this book so far, I find the first hand account of Ed Halsey quite interesting and comparable to other first hand accounts of the Civil War I've read. This said, having knowledge of the campaigns Ed is involved in goes a long way to making his letters interesting. But, if this is the first book I picked up on the Civil War, I'm not sure I'd read another. Bruce Chadwick includes interesting details of New Jersey during the Civil War, but I have to take what he says ""with a grain of salt"" due to errors in relating the Civil War. One that stands out to me, he places the sunken road and stone wall at the second battle of Fredericksburg on top of Marye's Heights (p.126) and there are quite a few more that I've found. So, if you are knowledgeable about the Eastern theater of the Civil War and enjoy first hand accounts, this book can be interesting, but otherwise there are much better first hand accounts available."
1,ouch,"these shoes took over two months to break in before they started to not kill my feet. I would have stopped wearing them but I had no more money to blow on crap shoes. they hurt right where your toe bends on the top of your foot. Other than the pain of wearing them, they look nice and are relatively classy."
4,McCuen,"This makes the 2nd time I've purchased this watch in the past 3 years. The first time I didn't register the purchase with Timex. When the watchband broke, I was unable to get a local jeweler to replace it. I looked online but couldn't find a band that I thought would fit; so I purchased the same watch a second time because I liked the way the watch operated and its functions. This time I've registered it with Timex so I'll be able to get a watchband for this one (and hopefully for the first one)when I need it."
2,Woodstock gregorian windchime,Chimes were much smaller than I expected. I was expectIng a much better tone and size for the outdoor chimes.
5,Nice!,"The sound of this chime is beautiful. We'll be ordering a couple more to complete the ""orquesta""."
4,Love the sound,"I ordered these for myself and liked them so well, I ordered another set for my daughter in law. They have great sound and are well made. Also, made in USA, which is a nice break from ""made in china""."
5,Beautiful!,"This has 8 tubes/chimes, rather than the usual 6, and you can tell the difference! In addition, I got the Gregorian Alto Chime (at another site), which also has 8 chimes. When the two windchimes play together . . . Heaven!"
2,Sound isn't great.,"The chimes are very pretty, but when they ring, there is a high-pitched buzzing that lasts for quite a while after the actual ringing stops. I noticed it as soon as I took the chimes out of the box to try them, and immediatly put them back in the box to return. I was going to give these as a housewarming gift, but I don't want to give something that's going to drive them crazy when they're trying to relax in their yard. I'll try a lower-pitched chime set instead -- I have one set in my backyard already, and they sound nice."
5,LOVE love love it,"Read all the windchime reviews, and then ordered this a year or so ago for my husband. It's been hanging outside every since it arrived a year ago, and we love it. Just a beautiful sound and looks ""handsome"" so it's a good gift for men."
2,Cheap,I was really disappointed in these. The chimes are lightweight and don't have that nice resonating sound I was expecting from the description. I didn't even bother hanging them up. The sound was not very pleasant. Will be returning.
4,Great look and sound!,"I bought this for my mom's birthday and she loves it! Whenever I visit, I see it hanging near her front porch. It catches just the right amount of wind and it sounds beautiful! My mom lives in a very rainy area, and the wind chime has held up to a lot of rain and wind!I like that the company provides the recordings on their website for each windchime. I listened to several and chose this one because it seemed more like music, as opposed to just dings and pings. It really is very melodious. My mom admired the quality of the product and is looking forward to many more years of use!"
1,MADE IN CHINA,"Woodstock Chimes laid off all of their artisans in America, raised their prices and sent their manufacturing to China. UPS is taking this back tomorrow, Ill find one made in the USA by a company that still cares about Americans."
1,Not Made in the USA,"I really wish I had read the review stating this product is made in China. Amazon's search for ""Made int he US"" is very disappointing and I am now doubting that I will be purchasing ANYTHING through Amazon again. This wind chime IS NOT MADE IN THE USA. THIS CHIME IS MADE IN CHINA. Returning this product and the Weber BBQ tools too."
5,Music Always!!,"I really love these chimes. They sound great no matter what order the chimes are hit in. I listen to them all day and my 2 year old son LOVES going to sleep listening to them. I hope they don't annoy the neighbors... Do you know what would be really cool? To get the soprano, tenor and bass chimes as well and hang them in four corners of the garden and have a quartet. All the time.Before I received these as a gift, I bought some different chimes because I wanted to go cheaper. Bad idea. Cheaper chimes were tinney and kind of annoying. If you want good tone, REAL MUSIC, to come from your chimes instead of just noise, these are the chimes for you. These are SO beautiful! I feel like I have some Gregorians chanting to me all day. I will never get sick of them. And if you're looking for a gift, the recipient of these chimes will think of you every time they hear that beautiful music outside. :) What a gift!"
5,Lovely windchimes!,"I was pleasantly surprised by my new windchimes...couldn't wait to hang them up.....very well made and the chimes are beautiful!!!! I'm sure we keep the neighbors ""up"" with the constant clanging:) I would highly recommend these windchimes!"
5,Worth every penny!,"I love this wind chime. Highly recommended to anyone thinking about purchasing it. It is my first wind chime, and I couldn't be happier. Plan to buy a couple more to harmonize and bring beautiful music to the backyard."
5,Amazing!,You will love the sound and look of these wonderful windchims.They are the very best I have ever seen and I will definately purchase others as gifts.
5,woodstock windchimes,I love my windchimes. I have had a beautiful set of windchimes that finally broke after about 10 years outside in the FLA sun and was looking for chimes that would be just as nice. These are definately it. I highly recommend them.
4,better discription is needed.,"I was somewhat disappointed that ""alto"" was not as low of a tone as I thought it was...hard to judge from the description because no size is mentioned and this made me reluctant to purchase. Although I was hoping for a lower tone, the sound is great, really great...with the best resonation of any of the chimes I own. I would have purchased a larger one if I could have figured out which ones might be lower. I'm not ""educated"" in anything musical so this could be a personal fault. However, I do think if the lenght of the tubes were listed, someone like me would be able to buy exactly what I wanted and would have given a 5 star rating...not the fault of the product..only the description."
5,Pleasent sound,"I got the whole set of Woodstock Percussion Gregorian windchimes from the Soprano, to the Baritone.Besides, it's weather resist, I own the original Olympic sound for over 6 years and still good as new. Definitely worth the money and long term enjoyment."
5,Love my chimes,All it takes is gentle breeze for the melody to soothe the soul. I bought this one to accompany others I have.
1,Don't waste your money on this video,"I bought this video because her Go video was sooo good. This one was a total waste of money! It is set up in sections; however, it's not split right. In order to do just combo 3 and 4, you have to do the warm up and quite a bit of section 1 and 2 first. The moves are VERY, VERY, VERY complicated! There is lots of turning on the step which made me soooo dizzy! She does not explain the moves well at all, and I was so lost while performing the combos because she never cued us up! I ended up doing my own routine most of the time while being ticked off that I paid money for this workout. Please don't waste your time or money on this it's just not worth it."
1,Pass on this one.,"You must learn a complicated routine in this video, so prepare to watch it many times."
3,Music Trivia,"Midnight Oil fans will appreciate the scene in which the four main characters attend a concert. The band performs ""Short Memory""."
3,"Enjoyable Story, But It's About Shoes","Probably best suited for 4-8 yrs. It's a story about a little girl and her new shoes. It contains moments of amusement and interest, BUT, it's about shoes.It could've been worse. This story could've been ""New Dental Floss For Silvia."" Yes the book does have good illustrations. Yes this story exposes children to other cultures (in another America). Yes the story makes children aware of economic disparity of children in other countries. But, it seems the author could've chosen a more interesting subject."
2,Poor container,The glue ran out the side of the cap (and all over the inside of my drawer) after the first use. Not a well-designed tube.
3,Freddie & Dreamers,"Sound quality good, but these are shifted slightly off the original recordings. That being said I'm sure a lot of buyers wouldn't mind that."
2,Oversights,This is a collection characterized by astonishing oversights. The editor's acquaintance with contemporary Irish poetry appears to be faint indeed.
3,Supermodel sings,"Yes this is ""THE"" Karen Mulder supermodel and rockstar.The entire cd is in french, in case you could'nt tell by thetrack listing. The style is a soft french rock that very commonon french radio. The cd is a good debut, she has talent. Karenfor years was the face of every international magazine. Karenrocked the world with her sex abuse claims while she was a model.That could be part of the reason her record company did'nt getbehind this, wanting to distance themselves from the allegations.Carla Bruni also has a cd former supermodel,singer, actress, international girlfriend,currently, at this time ofwriting the first Lady of France.As does Naomi Campbell which is the hardest to find. Her cd iscalled ""baby moma"". The single ""love and tears"" is actually good.These beauties have many talents, I'm sure that this is a collectable."
4,Fresh And New,"I am not a Ricky Martin fan at all! When I first heard ""I Don't Care"" it was not a typical Ricky Martin song at all! I liked it a lot! I decided to go purchase it and give it a whirl!I like the sound of this CD much more than his previous hits. To me, it sounds more ""street"" more ""raw"" and more ""hip/hip"". A little bit of a descent from the latin sound that all started to sound the same in every single one of his previous hits. This is a more hard hitting CD. Still his marginal vocals bit over MUCH better beats! Pleasently suprised here. There are a few latin-oriented songs - but not repetitively so.Standout tracks include: ""Til I Get To You"", ""I Don't Care"", ""Life"", ""Drop It On Me"" and ""I Won't Desert You""A very good, nice, new, fresh direction for Ricky to head in!"
5,from the man who never listen to Ricky before!!!,i went to the record bars here in Manila. There was a CD player there containing samples of Ricky Martin's LIFE CD. i have no idea about the content of this CD. i expected that it's the same Latin music like his previuos albums. i picked up the earphone and i had listened to this CD. i listened to the whole LIFE CD. after that i asked the assistant that i want to buy this CD. now i have it!!! i had listened to this cd for more than two months and i found it GREAT!!! BUY THIS CD!!!!
1,SUCKS!!!!,"This album completely sucks!!! I miss the days of ""Vuelve"" or even ""Ricky Martin"". Ricky needs Robi Rosa more than ever. I really like Ricky but this cd just sucks. I bought it on Tuesday and traded it on Wednesday. If you really like Ricky buy ""Vuelve"" it's an album full of authentic sounds and latin culture."
5,The best album ever,i can't stop listening to this entire CD!!! it is in my head 24/7 and all the songs are good so its worth buying the CD not downloading one song or something.
4,Makes you want to dance :-),"I initially got this CD because I fell in love with the ""I Don't Care"" video and just had to have this on my playlist on the way to work. I have a job where I speak to customers all day and I really need to be pumped when I come in (sigh). ""I Don't Care"" is definitely my feel good song of the day and my favorite on the album. I'm really more into his other 2 up-tempo songs on the cd, ""Drop it on Me"" featuring Daddy Yankee, and "" I Am"" featuring Omar are certified club bangers. When Omar starts rapping in his bass heavy voice in pure Spanish you just feel it. I love Ricky Martin and if you're a fan of his this cd will not dissapoint you. ""Luv you Ricky xoxo!"""
3,Ricky,"I enjoy Drop It on Me and Que Mas Da because it's Latin. Very Latin, but I don't enjot the rest of the album because he prefers to sing in English now. Man I miss the old Ricky. The Ricky that sang and danced to Latin music all the time."
1,the music sucks,I give it to him for travelling to get a multicultural inspiration for his music and his new look is looking good but that's where it ends. This album sounds way too overproduced to enjoy although he tried but failed. Hip hop doesn't suit him and though I appreciate him for trying out world music it just doesn't work for him.
3,Good Rickyton Life,"As a biggest Ricky Martin fan who's been waiting for this album along time,I have to say that the first single I don't care really sucks ,with Amerie and Fat Joe really ruin the concept of the song,but as a Puerto Rican I'm proud that he has chosen to bring raggaeton or should I say Rickyton brings fresh music for people to explore the popularity of reggaton. His music touches the soul while others its hard to understand ,but if you want to decide to purchase this cd listen to It's Alright and decide for yourself if the cd is good or not,but for me its a good cd ,but saying its excellent is overstating a little bit .NO matter how good the cd is or is not he's still rockin and super super Hot!!!!!!!!!!! Like Ricky said BOREQUA STYLE #1"
1,THIS STINKS!!,"I love Ricky but this is the most horrible CD I've ever heard. I dare say it is just as bad as that garbage JC Chasez tried to call a solo album. Ricky should go back to his ""She Bangs"" type music. That is what people want to hear. Stick with what works. Don't try to ""grow as an artist"". No one cares!!"
5,Feast for the soul...,"I love the fact that Ricky is not stuck in one ""genre box""...he ventures into many different genre lands on this CD, and he has certainly succeeded. Each song on the album has it's own unique vibe to it. ""Life"" is so open, free, and diverse...from the chant, to the string arrangements, through the reggaeton, the rock and the roll...into my hips...shaking and rolling,...""Life"" is a wonderful ride!!!"
5,Amazing,"This album is amazing, it is such a rich and vivid journey to experience. There is something for everyone to enjoy whether you like fast danceable music or lovely ballads. I highly recommend adding this cd to your collection!!!!"
5,Great Life!!!!,"I really wasn't that interested in ricky martin after that cheesy song ""Shake your bon-bon"" but, i thought i'd give this cd a chance. after i heard ""I don't care"" I got the cd. I am totally surprized!!!!! It has a pop, Indian feel to most of the songs. This is a really big step up from his last cd!!!! I would totally recommend ""Life""!!!!! Great Job Ricky!!!!!!"
2,Don't Buy . . . Includes Sypware! . . . Music Poor As Well,"Don't get this CD. Sony put a nasty piece of hidden Spyware on the disc, which will infect your computer when played. See the online reports for more details. As for the music, Martin's infectious energy is there, but as with previous projects, the music is banal with little or no sophistication in the lyrics. It is music for folks with low standards or low intellect. I've added a star because some of the up-tempo tunes have that kind of stadium-shaking energy."
3,LIfe did not deliver...,"I was actually anticipating this new album from ricky for months now. I just bought and listened to the cd yesterday and I was terribly let down. The new single 'I Don't Care' is very danceable and fun, but the other tracks I have to say were just too un-Ricky like and maybe that is what he was going for. The last track 'save the dance' written D. Warren who has written hit ballads for many artists is one of the album highlights and is the only ballad slow song on the album. All other tracks sound like they are trying to be too commercial. 'I Am', 'Stop Time tonight', and 'This Is Good', really stand out. The album has a very heavy indian influence as in the first track 'Til I get To You'. I did enjoy most of this album and will keep the cd but I was still very disappointed in ricky this time around.Life is definatley a more mature Ricky and has a very Hip-Hop feel to it. Great as a club cd."
5,Don't listen to all the bashers and the haters!,"They post the same message on all Sony released CD. But Life is an amazing CD musically. I played my copy on my computer and NOTHING happened to it, except me enjoying the great music. If you still have doubts about some program, then just don't play it on the computer. Play it in your CD player. Don't miss out on the fun and joy of Ricky's hot new music!"
1,"Why des this ""CD"" exist?","I thought he was forgotten since the 90's ended. Looks like he's back. Instead of this trash, buy ""Awake"" by Dream Theater."
2,Not what I was expecting,"The product I recieved was not blue, it was white. It was also not stretch~ it was all cotton... a wife-beater to be exact that comes with a flimsy cotton scarf. Not impressed."
4,"All in all a good buy, very comfy and the scarf is really cute","The shipping does cost more than the items themselves, but still worth the price.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I was expecting a strappy tank, but got a regular ribbed tank. It's very comfy, lightweight and flattering though. So that's why I still gave it more than 3 stars.The scarf was exactly what I wanted. It's really cute, well woven, and very versatile. If they had this available in another color still, I would get that too!"
2,Some useful info but a waste of money!,"I am studying for an upcoming vocal concert and I ordered this book to find out what foods are good for the voice, how to build singing stamina, and overall control. This book is basically a beginners guide to singing with very little helpful information and vocal training. The price is probably so high because of the warmup CD provided which is also very elementary. Spend the money on a voice coach!"
3,"Good, But Not Her Best","I absolutely love Lynn Kurland's style of writing, but I was a little dissappointed in the last book. The ""heroine,"" Iolanthe was a prideful, almost ungiving character. It almost seemed as if she loved Thomas...but then again maybe she didn't. But, I did enjoy Thomas' character, and Kurland's humorous writing is great. I can't wait for Jason's story which will come out next summer!"
3,OK but not her best,"I liked the basic premise of the book but it was too long and drawn out. The parts I liked best seemed to be when the characters from her other MacLeod series books make an appearance...Jamie, Ian, etc.I did like the ghosties. They provided a chuckle or two."
1,This book is not for everybody.,If you aren't into a ghost of a former Scottish Laird dressing up as Mickey Mouse than don't read this book. I found it to be a waste of time and money. While I don't expect romance novels to be the most realistic of book choices this one required a tremendous suspension of belief. I've read a Kurland book that I did like but this one was a true dissapointment.
4,"Nothing to consider, just do it!",I prefer not being in a toxic chamber during my hot showers so feel good that I have filtered water steaming my bathroom instead. Ahhhh KDF take me away!
3,1/2 the Show,"Te Kanawa is superb. Not quite as cliche as the movie, but very close.Mr. Higgins is completely lost. Unfortunately, Rex Harrison is the ONLY Henry Higgins that will ever be any good at it. The man on this CD is too slow in THE RAIN IN SPAIN.The Ascot Gavotte does not have enough people singing, and there are no horse imitations, so unless you know about Ascot or have seen the movie, you'll have no idea what the pause is for.In counter to the wretched Mr. Higgins and the lacking Chorus, the Orchestra is with Te Kanawa in its saving power, the only saving grace that this relatively lacking Cd has, besides the lyricism of ON THE STREET WHERE YOU LIVE.Personally, I would suggest that you spend your money on the play or the Movie soundtrack or the Original cast."
4,"an entertaining read, unfortunately long out of print","This collection of anecdotes was written by sportswriter Stretch Miller shortly before his death in the early seventies and contains tales spanning fifty years in the middle of the last century. Having read it once as a boy many years ago, I was pleasantly surprised to find upon a recent rereading that the stories stand the test of time while also providing a historical glimpse into the past. Stretch's unusual life and humorous writing elevates this book above other autobiographical collections of anecdotes. It is of particular interest to folks with ties to St. Louis, where Stretch worked with Harry Carey early in his career as a Cardinals broadcaster, and central Illinois."
2,An advanced SMS coding book,"This book is for advanced SMS administrators who work with SMS constantly. I was expecting the first few chapters to start from the beginning of an SMS install and explain some best practices methods, but this book expects you to have it all up and running.All the script examples show you how to modify sms to make life easier for administrators. And wheres the included PDF version of the book so you can copy the scripts?? Well you need to pay an extra $10 for the privledge!If you want to customise SMS and want example vbscripts then this book is definately for you. If you want a book to show you how to install and configure SMS & explain its options, buy another book.Edit: Greg had contacted me directly and pointed myself to his publishers website where the source code can be downloaded. Thanks Greg."
1,Outrageous S&H Fees,"Here is another company, that charges outlandish shipping & handling fees for their products. I guess the old saying ""Buyer Beware"" applies to companies offering products cheaper than their competition. When you add in the S&H fees, those cheaper prices suddenly become more expensive. Hopefully, I've saved you from the same fate as yours truly!"
5,best club-style work out video ever!,"ive been looking for a video which motivates me just like the gym to just do it and this is it. she gets right to the point.she walks around the class and really focuses on your form.its fast and the music is upbeat & motivating. in-between rests doing different ab work. the video only being 20 minutes doesn't really matter its well worth it. before the video talks she talks briefly about the areas she is going to work on.after the video ends everyone stretches out.my main concern was my form being sacrificed.but no matter what work-out video you do, you need to always focus on your form. no matter the pace. go at your own pace and rest if needed but never force yourself being your will jeopardize your form.so if you love the whole gym/club-style work outs then this if for you."
5,Kari Anderson - top class instructor!,"I bought this ab DVD a few years back for myself and have to say that I've never been disappointed with any of Kari Anderson's workout DVDs. I always get the full benefits of whatever she teaches. My daughter then asked me to purchase another for her to use while at college, as she's also familiar with the ab workout from using my DVD at home, so that just goes to show how we both enjoy it and like the results we have gotten from doing it.Great ab workout all round!"
3,Coaster at best,"For me, these were not big enough to use for just about anything but a coaster. I was hoping to use them for getting hot dishes out of the microwave but they are not big enough or bendable enough to cover the object so as not to get burned. They are just too stiff to use them for anything other than a coaster for coffee or hot chocolate. Neat idea but I would prefer something a little more flexible and bigger to get a grip on anything."
2,tiny,"They are called mini, but I did not expect them to be so tiny. Way too small for potholder, or much of anything besides a coaster."
5,Perfect for microwave/toaster oven use!,"I leave a pair on top of my microwave. So handy--right there so I won't burn myself! These little wonders work better than most pot-holders because they're not stiff (be sure to get the concentric-circle design, they flex every-which-way). Perfect for handling dishes with two lips, or for one-handed removal of small light-weight pans from the toaster oven. Because they're little, they don't get in the way and don't poke into the food at the edge of the dish, or get burned touching the broiler element . . . and they're just the right size for lifting a hot pot lid or opening a jar. I'm a surgeon and a perfectionistic tool freak; these remind me of the tiny high-end plastic surgical instruments which are so much more precise than a larger cruder tool. A joy to use!"
3,The picture is deceptive,"I liked the product, but I am disappointed by the size of the mats, they are much smaller than the image!"
2,Made in china,"I bought some in a store that were US made--they are really nice to use, and I could use a couple more, so I ordered them here...these look similar, but the quality isn't nearly as nice. It was no big surprise to find that they were made in china. The US. Made ones were easily worth the $6; I wouldn't pay more than $2-3 for the two-pack of Chinese-made"
2,"Incredibly predictable, to say the least","This book seemed as though the plot would be interesting and the story entertaining when I read the back cover. True? No, not at all - the story was weak and unbelievable. Do people really talk this way? Maybe a hundred years ago, romantic conversations would flow, or more aptly, NOT flow, as this book suggests, but nowadays, this type of language is basically unheard in conversations. Unless, of course, it is said in a period play or something like that...The characters in this novel were also disappointing. Never before in a romance novel have I read such stereotyped roles attempting to seem normal. As far as I've read, Pickart needs to get out a little and see what the current world is like, because this novel is fake and extremely disappointing."
3,Not as great as the conditioner,"This product is good. I don't think that all this balm is as good as the conditioner AND IF THIS MANUFACTURER WAS SMART, CHAZ DEAN, WOULD LOWER THE SHIPPING AND HANDLING. IT ALMOST DOUBLES THE PRICE OF THE ITEM."
3,tea tree oil,i have tried this product and still awaiting for a good result so far i'm still not quite sold bout this product.
3,Way to sweet and not enough licorice taste for me.,This was a dissappointment for me. I love licorice and was so shocked to find how sweet this stuff was. It did not taste fresh and did not have a strogn licorice taste. I would not buy again.
4,licorice review,"The Bassetts licorice itself was fabulous..but then, that is why I bought it. I knew it was fabulous.The shipping however, was ridiculous! This bag could have easily been shipped in a flat rate priority envelope for less than $5, instead of a box for a charge of nearly $8.00!"
5,Addiction!,"If I'm addicted to something (besides hardware), it's the Bassett Allsorts. Tons of flavor and always fresh. Last time I was in the UK I bought a dozen bags and puzzled the security at the airport! Getting some online as we speak. 5 stars."
5,Arizona Shopper,Bassetts Liquorice Allsorts packet 14 ozCandy arrived within 5 days at the Post Office after I placed the order. The candy arrived fresh and in 3 different sealed packages. I will order again.
5,Christmas ideas for the antipidians,"I buy Licorice Allsorts every year at Christmas for my friends from Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Apparently this was a favourite treat for many of them when they were young. I'm not much of a fan of licorice, but my friends tell me Bassetts is the best."
3,Bassett's Allsorts,"As a confirmed licorice addict, Allsorts are amongst my very favorites. Bassetts generally makes the very best. Unfortunately, of the two bags that I ordered one was fine but the other seemed to be old, dated , stock. The candies were hard and a bit hard to chew. The other bag was excellent. Will buy again, but will be careful of dated stock."
4,sweet dreams!,"The Sandman I received was the camo version and not the black model as advertised, but the knife is excellent, solid locking, lightweight, ergonomic and quite sharp. A very good tool you can count on!"
4,Love Spirituality Drugs,"Laughing Sky was a retro 3 piece psychedelic underground band from NYC. They had a loyal following for a couple of years which culminated in this album of uptempo psychedelic garage punk acid dance rock. A change in bass players enabled the music to live another year and morph to even more uncharted sonic noise, experimental jams, and mind tripping, joyfully leaving their live audiences with a more progressive, psychedelic experience. There are some great songs on this CD about drugs, aliens, love, spirituality and drugs. I took off one star because they were better live than on record, but get it anyway. At 4 bucks used, you can't lose. There are bootlegs available if you know the right people."
4,"Science Meets Emotion, and Falls In Love...","Touching on every facet of every mood every woman has ever had, Ms. Amode's poems painstakingly dissect and describe all the emotions under the sun. From romance to raw sex, from music to numerology, she explores and examines the treasures of our universe with both joy and heartbreak in her voice. Her words speak out loud the soul's thoughts.Honest and wistful one moment, sly and sensual the next, Ms. Amode draws the reader into her world with words magically brought together in magnetic and insightful prose.A lovingly crafted and very promising first book. I look forward to seeing more of her work."
1,awful,"This book is terrible. Misspellings, poor grammar, inappropriate use of words, and extremely childish attempts to sound sexy, smart or interesting. It sounds like what a 12 year old schoolgirl would scribble on a notebook about her first crush. Many of the words make no sense in the sentances she uses them. No rhythm at all. No thought put into them. It looks as though they simply picked words randomly in a dictionary and strung them together. Or worse, it looks like they used one of those poem generators that just throws words together in a jumble. Very sad they didn't at least take a basic spelling and grammar course before attempting to write anything, and very embaressing results of not at least understanding the words being used."
1,I would like to know,"why my negative review of this book was removed. I've read the poems and gave an honest review. There is nothing sensual about this book, and contextually it is on par with my grammar school stepson. Some of the poems are also highly derivative of other authors that post around her."
4,Poet,"That would be,embarrassing and publicly. You need the red marker a bit more dear. This is why you did not understand the book."
3,Soul Words,"Inspiration in each page.I belong to a poetry community Reine shares with. Got the book about a week ago and have some pages marked already. She has some very sexy poems and is one of the most sensual writers to me since Charles Baudelaire. Reine is very intense and as she always says, 'paints' with words. The only thing I had a issue with was the cover. I think it is kinda lame."
2,Didn't convince me to keep reading the series,"The first Splinter Cell book was decent enough for me to give this second one a shot. I doubt I'll read any more, however. I found Operation Barracuda pretty unengaging. There were too many convenient developments at key moments and predictable plot lines. It was an improvement that this book remained almost totally in the first person, where the first book bounce back and forth between first and third. That wasn't enough to keep me enthused about reading it, though. Even for being just a commute read this book didn't do it for me."
3,I wish it was written by T.C.,"Action - extremly fast - that's great.Text - doesn't leave any reflections like Ryanverse did.Considerations - I feel cheated. When I bought the Book I was convinced I spend my money on a new Tom Clancy novel which really begins a new verse. Turns out it's not.I wish Tom Clancy wrote it. Michaels sucks. I believe I could write such a book. Well, I'm even pretty sure about that. But as a book as an entertainment, nothing else, - it's OK. You won't be borred. Only dissatisfied if you think it is a new Tom Clancy novel.Greets."
1,"HORRIBLE - Duped by ""Clancy"" on the Cover","This is horrible writing and I feel cheated by both the publisher and Clancy.I was in a rush to get something before my flight and with Clancy's name in big bold letters on the cover, I figured buying it was a no-brainer. I picked it up after takeoff and after the first few pages (of bad writing) I took a closer look at the cover and realized that Clancy isn't the author, he just lent him name to it for the additional royalties. Ugh. I'll admit that it's partially my fault but c'mon, have more respect for yourself and your readers, Tom. I'll get something by Crichton next time."
2,This Series is off my wish list.,"I have read lots of Tom Clancy's books, and feel this is not up to his standards. Shame on you Tom for letting your name be on this quality of writing."
3,The first one was better.,"I was disappointed when I finished the book, and felt that the plot was by far too cumbersome and not as straightforward as the first one. I admit that I enjoyed the twist at the end, but everything else I predicted would happen many pages earlier.(...)"
3,Uneven writing,"While the plotting of this book is reasonably strong, the writing doesn't keep pace. Michaels employs the device of having some chapters written in first person and others in third person. The first-person chapters are definitely weaker as far as the writing goes. At times, the verb tense changes between sentences. Some say that these type books are written for the adventure and to expect quality writing is to place a burden on them they should not have to bear. The only problem is that Clancy, Larry Bond and Dale Brown have all proven that one need not have to make a choice. So, all in all it's not bad, but it could have been much, much better."
4,Not as good.,"Right from the start, I thought this book not to be as good as other books by Barbara Brooks Wallace. As in all most of her books that I have read, though, characters underwent totall personallity morphs at the end. I would not reccomend this book highly."
1,Way Too Small,"I can not fit my 60D in this bag unless I take all of the dividers out and place it sideways. Then, I am unable to place another lens in the bag. The 6 is too small to be truly functional for me, even though I wanted a small bag to minimize weight on my back. I'm returning it. For the price, I'm moving up to the 7 which is only $5 more and much more functional."
1,Did not receive product ordered,We ordered the child size patches and instead received the adult size. We can not use these on a 4 year old boy.
2,Karbala Husain martyrdom novellete,"""Husain the Great Martyr"" by Fazl Ahmad; ""Heroes of Islam Series""; Sh. Muhammad Ashraf Publ., Lahore, Pakistan, (1969, 1971, 1975), 148 text pages (w/ ads = 160 total pgs); small, mass paperback. This is a pro-Shia booklet written in homage to Imam Hasan and Imam Husain, and the martyrdom that Husain experienced at the Battle of Karbala (Iraq). Recounts the basic facts of the history of the Ali-Muawia dispute, and the history of the battle. Okay for Shiite teenagers only; very polemical -something to be passed out during Ashura for the Imam Husain followers. Just not scholarly; no objectivity. No citations for quotations, no bibliography. Not for anyone `researching' this topic. For those Shiites who need a good cry during the month of Muharram. One-star for the 'value' of this booklet, two-stars for a good cry for my Shiite friends."
1,"yo,dawgedy dawg dis game stinks on ice wit da mo","the only way you would like this game is if you like the show,which i dont,it is noooooooot gooooood"
5,Lovely,"Originally we checked this book out at the library. My daughter feel in love with this story. She has a big sister and it was perfect for her, and at the time we were struggling with the I am afraid of the dark. This book helped"
3,Fun fun sushi fun,"This book has some sixty different sushi roll designs. Many are just different colors and shapes without much care for different flavors. I imagine with some creativity that can be cured using different ingredients. Almost too much for a casual sushi maker, this seems like a catering guide for any occasion."
2,diadora monza turf - wrong size,"The shoes look ok, but my kid couldn't utilize because even the box say size 3.1/2 the shoes are size 2.1/2 and when I realize,I was in another country."
5,When they were good....and together.,"Sadly, Citizen King is no more. Even worse, I don't care. Mobile Estates showed what a big record company could do to a great band.When the guys from Citizen King were in high school, I used to go see them all the time, since their high school was 10 minutes away from mine. The sound they had back then was simply amazing. A mix of funk, hip-hop and rock that I've never heard duplicated.Brown Bag LP was The King at their finest. If you have a chance to get you hands on this album, you will throw away your Mobile Estates album. All Estates is, is a ground down overmixed dulled down Citizen King."
2,very dissapointed :(,"I thought this album would be the roots from which mobile estates grew, but was I wrong! The singer sounds NOTHING like he does on mobile estates.Neither does the music. I really can't see how they came from this to mobile estates. It is very accurate to say his voice has matured GREATLY over the years. When I first played this cd, I thought maybe the first track was sung by one of the other band memebers.His voice on this Lp in my opinion is very nasaly and adolescent. The whole album sounds like a watered-down early chili peppers album with keyboards and little to no melody. I HATE the chili peppers!! The only good thing about this album is it seems to have some pretty descent lyrics. I listeneed to the whole cd and I can't even distinctly remember 1 song, that's how bad it is. Not one single melody. Oh well. Damn it this album sucks.."
5,Sorry we used them up!,We religiously watched every episode available of this series. We were so sorry when we saw the last one. Looking forward to the next series becoming available. We are hooked on British television series and hardly ever watch commercial tv anymore.
2,Too delicate to hear,In my opinion too small and too delicate a sound. I like my Gregorian Alto ones much better.
4,They do the job,These are vacuum cleaner bags so there is not that much to say about them. They fit the vacuum and collect the dirt. They do what they are supposed to do so I'm happy with them.
4,Well Tuned,"I tend to like the bigger windchimes -- the ones with full, rich tones. But it's good to have a tinkler around to complete the sound spectrum.The tones ring clear with no dissonance. The sound is very peaceful, despite the high pitch that comes from such short chimes.There is one problem, however. One side of the wind catcher (the diamond-shaped part at the bottom) has a reflective part that is meant to catch the sun, and refract and reflect the various colors of the light. Unfortunately the disk is nothing more than a reflective sticker. The temperature and humidity changes between night and day in autumn have caused this sticker to begin to peal. I suspect within a few weeks it will come completely off."
1,no sound,"I have a set of these windchimes and though beautifully tuned, I could never get them to ring. I have other types of chimes on the outside of my house, they all chime, but I could never find a location where these would ring. I am very disappointed with this product."
5,an extraordinary book,"A fascinating book with Swiss rural locale, Parisian politicians and actresses, pretty women, bad men, secret scandal, complex but riveting plot, and lucid and easy prose. This was my first glimpse of this author, suggested in a travel publication for one who likes travel, and picked off a library shelf, and I immediately looked for all her other books. Others don't look as good, but ""Death of a Dutch Uncle"" was fine. I'm mighty glad I didn't miss this one."
1,Insatisfecho con la compra,"Cuando me decidí a comprar este libro, estaba pensando en una guía simple para trabajar con transporte de metales en cauces de agua superficial y subterránea; sin embargo, a medida que avancé en los capítulos (solo revisé bien el primero, y someramente los otros) me di cuenta de que la matemática involucrada es muy descriptiva (y un poco críptica) y no está muy orientada hacia un manejo simple de datos con el fin de calcular transporte."
2,not a performance one could dream about,"It is a very poor and boring interpretation: frequent fast tempos instead of grace and charm (for example, compare with ""Concertos"" by Camerata Bern or by Kuijken). It looks like a formal and cursory approach only to demonstrate the virtuosity of the players. In the note line it is said that the musicians mounted the winged Pegasus. It is a lie! they ride a wild mustang and gallop as if in a rodeo race. I am very disappointed. Any project intended to record a volumnious music in a short time (here we have the spring of 2004)is doomed to failure. The only plus is the complete music in one box set."
1,Defective Engineering,"I was impressed this item didn't contain a condensation tray as most thermoelectric wine coolers do (which require you to periodically empty condensed water into the sink). I quickly learned, however, refrigeration devices need condensation trays otherwise the cooling unit will clog with ice. So after a year of constant defrosting, the motor finally blew because the fan repeatedly got clogged with ice."
1,inferior product,item stopped working after two months. returned to company at my expense (28.00) worked for two weeks when it was returned. they refuse to refund the purchase price and refuse to pay for the return postage again. told me it is my responsibility. canadian company that doesn't care if customer is satisfied. return postage has increased the price by 45%. forced to return it in order to get it fixed again or eat the purchase price. refuse to allow me to speak to anyone else in the company except for the clerk that answered my e-mail. now out $56.00 in postage and it still stopped running. have lost a total of 9 bottles of wine due to malfunction.
3,Decent,"These picks are okay, but I was not impressed. The only reason I bought them was to spend enough money to get free shipping, plus I liked the color. I usually use Fender medium picks, and compared to Fender, these Daisy Rock picks are extremely thin and flimsy."
5,super cute,these guitar picks were super cute and completely what I expected they shipped quite quickly and my 11 year old daughter completely loves them
3,Sonics - 'Sinderella' (Bomp),"I'm still trying to figure out as to just WHICH band The Sonics this CD is from.Apparently,it's NOT the '60's band.It's reportedly/supposedly a late '70's New Wave version OF the late '60's band WITH lead vocalist Gary Roslee as the sole original member.Easy enough to remember.Anyway,the music here is 'okay',but nothing all that special.Tracks I thought were the best are ""Shotdown"",""Tallahassee Lassie"",""Up Into The Junction"" and their completely off-key cover of ""Louie Louie"".Check it out for yourself."
1,A shadow of their former selves,"This is the album that real Sonics fans should ignore. In a nutshell, Sonics frontman Gerry Roslie decided to have another kick at the can in 1980 and gathered together a bunch of no-names to form a band that were the Sonics in name only. The result? An album that we should pretend never happened."
4,"OK, so I'm actually reviewing vacuum cleaner bags.....","They seem to filter quite well, with no noticeable dust in the interior of the bag compartment (which is more than I can say for the actual factory bags. In combination with the vacuums HEPA filter, the air is probably cleaner after I vacuum than before. They are also an excellent value for the money, and I avoided going to the local box store. Why 4 stars, you ask? If I'm gonna give a household item 5 stars, it's gonna load itself and clean my floors while I drink a beer!"
3,good bags,not what I was expecting but good price for what I got them .I would recomend if you are in a low budget.
5,As advertised,"Perfect fit in my eight year old vacuum that calls for this style but couldn't find in local stores. Having pets, I go through a lot of vacuum bags and the nine-pack is convenient."
2,Won't stop beeping and timer lacks a key feature for me,"I am a soccer referee I mainly wanted this watch for use during the games I ref. The problem I have with the watch is that the countdown timer once completed doesn't reset to the time you previously entered so you have to reset manually each time. This is pretty much a deal breaker for me as my previous watch would just reset once complete. Also the watch beeps everytime you hit a button so when you do reset the timer, change to the clock or stopwatch it beeps every time. I would like an option to turn off the beeps. These issues i have may be no big deal to someone else but compared to my old watch this thing is a piece of junk. Do yourself a favor and spend 10-15 bucks more for a Better watch"
3,Good watch if you like the beep sound,"This is like most $20 Timex watches. Good quality. Works well. Looks good. Only one problem. It has a permanent beep setting every time you hit a button other than the Indiglo button. Very annoying. Enough to only give this three stars. There is no way to turn that beep off. You can turn on/off alarm and hourly chimes, but the button beep is fixed. If you just look at the time and don't access the alarm, stopwatch, timer or second time zone, you'll be fine. No button pushing, no beeps. But if you think you will use these other features a lot, be ready to be ""that guy"" on the bus or in the room whose watch keeps beeping each time you hit a button. Not sure what Timex was thinking on this one..."
5,Great watch for the gym,"I ordered this watch because my local Target stores topped carrying the one I usually buy. This is an excellent replacement, an upgrade in quality, and I'm hoping it lasts longer than the year I usually get from a gym watch. The features are easy to use and the watch even looks good. Definitely recommend!"
4,A little complicated,"The watch is nice, but the fine tuning is a little cloudy. The watch arrived very fast and in good condition. Band is a bit too stiff. Thanks for a great deal.Chuck Ray"
1,"Not water-resistant at 30 feet, much less 50 meters!","Picked up this watch at the last minute before a sailing/ snorkeling/ scuba trip since my usual Timex Ironman had just died, and the price for the 1440 was only 1/2 to 1/3 that of the Ironman I usually buy. While this watch was only rated water-resistant to 50 meters/ 165 feet (unlike the 100+ meters for the Ironman) I didn't expect it to be an issue since as a recreational diver I never dive that deep.However, I got what I paid for - the 1440 couldn't even handle a half hour in shallow (< 30 foot) water on my first dive - and what's even worse, it was a dive that ended up being more snorkeling than diving; by the time I was back on the boat the face was so badly fogged that it was impossible to read the watch, and it hasn't cleared to any significant degree in the days since.The watch is getting returned."
3,Great Value but Not Exactly as Pictured,"I want a watch to tell time when I go to the gym or play sports. For the price at Amazon, it really can't be beat even if it dies in a year or two. It has all the standard chrono, alarm, and timer functions. I would prefer the timer to retain the value I set after it counts down instead of having to set it every time.The one major reason that I took a star off is that the watch does NOT have a green face like the picture. Some watches, like an Armitron a friend has, glow green depending on the angle. I thought I was getting similar technology here but the dial face is just black numbers on greyish silver white background. When illuminated, it turns blue; it never has the green face. I would have returned it had it cost more, but it is not worth it here.I am surprised no one has yet mentioned this. Maybe I got a lemon?"
4,Nice watch,I purchased this watch to wear boating. It is ideal for wet conditions but is a little difficult to see in sunlight.
4,pennys,xmas shoppin at pennys I noticed a sale in the middle aisle.40% of on watches.timex rack had my watch for 42.oo.I paid 15.00 plus shipping.
3,Nice watch. Timer is it's weakness.,"As the title indicates. A watch timer, especially one labeled as a Sports watch, should not have to be set every time it's used. No complaints on anything else and it is very presentable."
3,"Decent, but has some big drawbacks","The watch is fine, except for one major problem - the buttons stick out so much that they are always getting pressed accidentally when I put on/take off my bookbag or if my wrist comes into contact with a hard surface! Which means that for every 3 out of 4 times I look at the watch, it is displaying the wrong mode - i.e. the stopwatch, or - even worse - the alarm mode (which confuses me because it looks just like the normal mode). So I need to think for a few seconds whether the numbers I'm looking at make sense, often to realize that I need to press the ""mode"" button a few times to cycle through until I get back to the normal clock mode. Really annoying.Also, the first one I bought must've been a lemon, because within a week, one button had fallen off and the second counter had become unreadable! I returned it and got a new one, which has no problems, except for what I mentioned above."
4,Good basic watch for men,"I don't like to spend a lot on watches, since my husband goes through so many. This has all the basic functions he needs & is sturdy & neat-looking. As far as I could tell, comparable items in stores were more expensive, so I bought on Amazon, which provided a better value."
4,A Useful and Affordable watch,"I was pleasantly surprised by this watch. I didn't pay a whole heck of a lot for it and yet it came with some very useful features, such as the countdown timer. Most watches come with a stopwatch and alarm feature but the countdown feature is really useful and will go up to 24 hours. Another nice feature is the top circle window that displays the date or the current feature you are using. I have not tried diving with the watch so I can't say if it is truly waterproof or not. The watch also looks nice and doesn't feel cheap. I've heard others say that the face is not the green depicted above, that's true it's more of the greenish gray that most watches are."
4,Worth the money.,been running and tells time. Wear in the shower and sheds water like it should. Easy to read for my 72 year old eyes.
2,Finishing is bad,THe watch is good for the price but I was not happy with the look. It does not look as nice as in the pictures.
5,Great Watch,"I use it for running 20-25miles a day with my XC team and it works fine. Its water resistant, extremely comfortable and after a day or so, you get used to running with a watch."
5,Good solid watch.,"I've gotten many a watches because the wrist strap thing broke off. Probably because of wearing it it into the shower all the time. When they make watches waterproof, I don't think they make the straps durable enough. Took a chance and bought a watch off Amazon. Seems like a sturdy watch, and better deal than buying in stores where they just sit there ticking. No complaints if it lasts a year without breaking. The longest lasting watch I've had where the strap didn't break off was from Burger King.LOL"
2,Cheap construction,"I bought this watch for running so I wasn't expecting much. However, within the first week I discovered the backlight button had disappeared for no apparent reason. This allowed water to condense on the inside of the bezel which made the watch impossible to read. Perhaps I got a lemon but I wouldn't expect too much from a watch this cheap."
2,I wouldn't recommend it.,"First the good: It's cheap, it tells time, it has a stopwatch, and I received it within 2 days.Beyond that, it's pretty mediocre.* The watch is bigger and heavier than I had expected, given that it's described as a sports watch.* The controls are not as intuitive as I would like, though they'll do. Unlike many sports watches, the start/stop button for the stopwatch is not located on the front of the watch.* The biggest drawback is the display. For so large a watch, it's surprisingly hard to read at a glance. The display is awfully cluttered. A lot of it is wasted on a terribly designed day/date display, which is almost unreadable.Given the low price, it's not really worth returning. However, I'll spend a bit more, next time."
5,Got my worth,"I bought this as a gift, and my friend wore it every day until the band broke. Got my moneys worth out of it...."
1,This is a horrible reissue - DON'T BUY,"This release is horrible. The label that put it together had no idea (or did not care) about the track order of the original albums. For the PARABLE OF ARABLE LAND, each track fades out where it should lead into one another. AND it is missing 2 of the ""Free Form Freakouts""!!!!! This is unacceptable.GOD BLESS... has a completely messed up track order. And 2 songs from the second album are inexplicably included on the CD of the first album.This is a mess. Don't buy.By the way, the music on this album should be 5 stars, but in the context of this release it is unlistenable."
5,Deservedly won the Pulitzer and Tony,"I have read David Auburn's play, and saw it on Broadway with Jennifer Jason Leigh in the lead. Even though the performance I saw was less than stellar, the brilliance of the script shone through. Auburn has written four compelling characters, each of which is haunted in some way, most obviously the title character, haunted both by the ghost of her father and the inheritance of both his brilliance and possible madness.This is a tightly written, emotionally driven four-character drama, full of insight, humor, intelligence, and romance. A must-read for actors, dramaturgs, and lovers of good theatre."
4,Well written .....,Certainly it would be difficult to take exception to the writing of this movie (story) .... To this is a tradgedy and a character study where more than once the viewer will find themselves frustrated that we can't get out of our seats and slap a few of the characters to 'get with it' .....I found it starnge that our main character didn't have at least ONE friend that would provide an anchor for her to ba able to evaluate realty from fantasy. Certainly the story drags a little bit and some of the flashbacks were definitely gratuitous but as a whole I loved it ......
3,Weak Theme and Ending,"The plot of this well written and well constructed play is summarized clearly in the Editorial Reviews section above. In terms of action, dialogue, and character development, this play is very good, and with good actors, I don't doubt that Proof provides a worthwhile evening at the theater. What, however, is the theme or content of this play. Is it about mathematics? Is it about creativity? Is it about some other major issue but using mathematical metaphors in the way that Michael Frayn used quantum physics in Copenhagen? The answer to all of these questions is no. The author may have intended to write primarily about conflicts between family obligations and personal creative impulses but this emerges as a secondary theme. What seems to come to the fore is a relatively conventional search for romantic love and there is nothing particularly novel about this. The ending, in particular, is disappointingly conventional."
5,"A CHALLENGING, ENTERTAINING PLAY","Not since David Hirson's brilliant La Bete and Wrong Mountain has Broadway seen a more exciting play than Proof! I recommend this book to anyone who appreciates theatre that is as challenging as it is entertaining. I sent many friends to see the original production, and none was disappointed."
1,"PROOF, the play","I have returned the book to the seller, Penn Text in Willow grove, PA. and have requested a full refund. The book was so marked up as to be practically unuseable.William Raper, Jr."
4,Had to read it for class but still....,"I'm a journalism major and was required to take some form of art class, so I chose Theater 101. This isn't a bad play, in fact when I first heard the synopsis, I thought my God what a terribly boring concept for a play. The dialog and character development is what changed my attitude. I know among college students this is a requirement (pending on your professor) but for all you future playwrights out there, give it a try."
3,"It's a good play, but not moving.",I bought this for a literature class I took last semester. I was really unimpressed by it. Slow moving and dull.
3,It's a Pulitzer Prize winner,"I purchased this for a class I was taking. For those interested in script writing, this is a brilliant piece of work with a streamlined, linear plot line. If you are looking for this as a story, you need to see a performance."
5,What a beautiful set of wind chimes,These chimes sound beautiful and are definitely a work of art. I am glad we bought this for our porch. Thank you Woodstock.
4,Sounds like church bells,"This is a beautifully crafted chime. I also have the Woodstock Gregorian Alto and Soprano, which are smaller. I wanted to complement those two with this big one, tuned to the same scale. However this one sounds too much like church bells because of the low pitch. We decided to return it because we didn't want the house to sound like the neighborhood church which is just around the corner. It is still a very nice sound, just possibly could be misinterpreted by the neighbors. So far my favorite in the Gregorian series is the Alto chime. The Alto sounds more like ""nature"" instead of bells."
3,Not quite as advertised...,"Those who buy this 56"" windchime should know that the longest chime is 32""... and so it doesn't have the deep tones that Gregorian baritone implies. Baritone what? My wife likes it, so I'll keep it, but I don't think it is truth in advertising. And it's probably my first and only purchase from this maker, because I have no idea what I am buying.I would like to add, in 2009, that I have grown to really like this wind chime. Its sound is pleasant, not real deep, but pleasant. It is still important to me to know how long the actual chimes of a wind chime are before a purchase... which is difficult to determine from the description."
5,Hmm . . .,". . . Looks like quality plummeted since my purchase. The cost today is $118.54 and I purchased mine back on 19 Jun 01 for $89.99 (plus some -$10.00 I had). As of 19 Jun 10 my chimes are fine. I have no idea if the tone is correct or not, however it sound deep to me. What I can say is that the quality of the set I received was better than what some describe in their reviews. That quality has held up very well. Nothing was 'coated' or 'painted' or '2nd hand quality'. Furthermore, my set has weathered some pretty strong winds and made it through fine. Seems like the company decided making money was more important than quality sometime after 19 Jun 01, which is a shame since the chimes I purchased are awesome. I'm sorry for those who received the poor quality version because at one point the quality was outstanding."
1,Do NOT buy these Chinese chimes,"Well, fellow nature lovers, these chimes are not for you. I lusted for Woodstock chimes for years: made in America, finest materials, etc. etc., so last week I splurged, only the best. But Woodstock Chimes (upstate New York), are not made in upstate New York of the finest materials, by happy hippies; no, they are made of lousy, fake materials in China, probably by children. Out of the box, the thin, polyester strings broke, torn from the cheap little tacks that held the heavy (but weirdly -painted shiny ""silver"") tubes to the wood.I've returned them; we'll see what happens, but don't make my mistake."
5,Sounds great,"My wife loves chimes, and this one really pleases her. It is one of her favorite gifts this Christmas. I will probably get another in the near future."
5,Exotic Melody,I have always been a faithful customer of Woodstock Chimes because of their beautiful musical tone and fine quality. The Bariton Gregorian has a little deeper tone and is a lovely contrast to the others.
5,Incredible Instrument,"This is our third set of Woodstock Percussion chimes. I bought the Gregorian Baritone chimes for my wife's birthday because our former set had finally seen its better days after 12 years of providing beautiful melodies hanging near the front porch. After she opened them, I immediately noticed some improvements in the design and craftsmanship. Most notable was a small rubber grommet in each tube where it suspends from the string. This should eliminate the sharp edge on the holes from cutting through the string over time. The tone is incredible on these chimes and we look forward to many years of enjoyment. I would highly recommend any product from Woodstock Percussion. They obviously have a passion for their art and build the best chimes I've found."
4,Michael W. Kimball,"All-in-all, I enjoyed the book. In particular, I related to Martin in this time and place (I also go to the same beach, but no kahuna has yet to approach me).. It is very clever to show a time-traveller his previous incarnations and the work he needs to do. Being shown an aspect of one's personality (anger) by a Master is a real gift, that, with faith, we can recieve with the sincere objectivity that leads to a remembering of the self. Will we have a chance to see more of Martin's life adventures?"
4,Digging Deeper,"This book starts out with Martin Devon bumbling through life; a good and kind man, but one unable to move through the problems that come up again and again. His work stresses and his problematic marriage are creating ""a gnawing tension in the pit of his stomach"". The good news is that Martin is also a brave man, and this enables him to jump headfirst into situations that, though threatening, enable him to have the experiences that ultimately heal his troubled soul.Expanding on the theme that later runs through the book The Secret, the author makes use of the teachings of many spiritual sources to show, not only that we each create our reality by the way we think, but also that our subconscious thoughts create, as does our karma. Even better, the book takes us on a well researched and rip roaring trip through ancient Celtic Briton and leaves us, at the end, with much to ponder, and with a thirst to know more."
5,A Beautiful Book,"I finished reading ""Dream Maker:A Mystical Tale"" a week ago, and I can't get it out of my mind. Whenever I meet someone, or read the news, or simply walk in the park, I think of what the novel had to say to me about life in general. This novel deserves a lot of praise and I think it will become a spiritual clasic, a trend setter for others to follow. For me, it opened doors for understanding the wolrd and myself, and appreciating all the life's lessons, the bitter and the sweet.It is the story of the author's past life, and the book does a great job of showing how karma works in connection with reincarnation, and why the author ended up clinically depressed in this life. The psychologist who reviewed the book and specializes on past-life regression thought the book was excellent, and it is the reason why I bought it.I am very glad I did. Grigor Fedan, Thank you for this rare spiritual gift."
2,Mystical Lite,"The wisdom the author is attempting to convey would fit on a few pages. We have ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" with much ""mystical"" falderol but lacking the Twainian humour. This is a story of dreams within dreams within dreams etc. etc. until it's difficult to recall who's who or what's what (and after awhile who cares). It's hard to feel much of anything for these phantasmagorical changlings. The story became so convoluted it was fatuous. For me it was like Lite beer---Nothing much to it."
2,Not What I Expected,"I bought this book based on the feedback on this page. And although I would not call the book unusable, it has a lot of scope for improvement. The book layout is terrible and there is almost zero cross refrencing in the book itself. Imagine the author does not ask the reader to look in another part of the book for more information. So my verdict is that although the book has good content, it's laid out in a haphazard way."
3,"Decent, but not great","I looked at several books concerning this subject. This is a good book, but really not any better than others I have looked at. Really, I would go with whatever is cheaper."
1,One star...because I can't go lower,"What a load of [...]! The author obviously knows NOTHING about Marines or how they do their jobs. He doesn't even get the details right so I might think he is just trying to obscure the plot for reasons of ""national security"" as he says in the introduction. If you want to buy this tripe, buy it used. Let's not encourage him with royalties to write any more."
4,about time...,"Force Recon has stayed in the dark regions of Covert Operations far too long. The reasons are many and better left unsaid, better to leave that to your imagination. P.W. Storm has taken the time to listen to his advisors nad pulls off a great piece of Fiction that will keep you rivited. If you've ever wanted to fell what its like to work way back in ""Indian Country"" then Force5Recon will certainly fit your bill. Enjoy the read its well worth it."
4,Worth Reading,"Although the Irish Republican Army was probably a hotter topic when this book was written, I liked it and recommend it to others."
5,This book got me into reading,"Four years ago as a High School senior I had to pick a book for an independent reading assignment in English class. I chose this book and liked it so much that I began reading for pleasure, not just out of necessity. Now, I am never w/o a book and it all started w/ Conundrum."
4,I thought it was good,"My Irish heritage leads me to gravitate toward stories in this vein. Although I don't normally go for this genre, I liked it."
4,Its good,"I know who ""chuckster"" is and why ""he"" wrote a negative review. He did not read the book, and has a personal animus against the author unrelated to anything literary. The book is not ""pseudo-intellectual"" in fact it is not intellectual at all. Nor is it a ""political commentary."" I read it and enjoyed it for what it is: a short mystery/thriller. If you like the sound of the book's description, you'll probably enjoy the book itself."
4,I would recommend it for young readers....,"I would recommend this book to children of young ages. It teaches the very basics on hamster care but does not go into depth about these things like I was hoping . : / If you have a child between the ages of 6 or 7 to 10 this would be a GREAT book for them to understand how to groom ,when to feed, what to feed,and how to set up there cages . : )"
2,Not well put together.,"This book has a lot of good information, but it doesn't explain itself very well. There are a number of incorrect formulas from bad editing. The author doesn't explain where he is getting different numbers and results from. He skips too many steps when explaining things. If you already have a strong understanding of radiation therapy physics this book would be fine, but if you're trying to learn it this book is lacking."
2,Not all that great,"This harmonica mic does not give you a Chicago style sound. I have tried it with many different amps and it has not made any type of connection with it. So, they probably sent me a defected cord. The cartridge inside of it was mass produced in Japan and is not any type of vintage. The blue paint and the Hohner symbol can come off way to easily. This is a VERY unconsistant mic. I have been at a performance before for a sound check, and I couldnt even use it because it doesnt work. I played on a Shure Green Bullet the other day and it was MUCH better. It really gave you that ""dirty"" sound. I would recomend the Green Bullet, but not the Blues Blaster."
4,Kimota Komments,"If you have ever wondered what happened to the Miracleman series from Eclipse comics, this companion book will explain everything. It has a showcase of issue covers from the Miracleman comics and an extensive interview section that is almost too painful to read.If you like ""too much information"" this is the book for you. The last part of the book explains the controversy of character ownership and most everyone who is involved has a different story."
3,Its alright...,"I purchase this as a retainer for work. The ends seem very big to me and catch light very easily. While I do like wearing it as a retainer, I'm not sure it would work for someone else. There aren't many people where I work that would notice and say anything. A smaller ended one would be nice but this is working for now."
2,Not as Good,"This product is much cheaper than I thought it would be. But, for the price I should have expected that. It has a nice sound, but, the strings are real thin and don't look like they will last for any time. They are almost frayed. It was shipped in a timely fashion. Get the more expensive one if you want it to last any length of time."
3,These are tiny!,"I was disappointed that these were so tiny. I considered sending them back, but will keep them myself and give my sister something else."
3,"Nice sound, but really small. I recieved it for a Mother's Day gift!","This item is nice in small places, the chimes are really nice to hear it really does pack a punch for the size."
5,I love this workout!,"I'm a very fit and experienced exerciser, but tend to focus on cardio and weights. This DVD combines balance, strength, flexibility and toning in a smooth and enjoyable workout. I love the pace, the exercises, and Kari Andersen's cuing. I always feel that it's time well spent and I certainly feel it the next day. If you're looking for a program that leaves you worked out without feeling worked over, this DVD is for you."
2,A Little Disappointed,"I purchased this cookbook a few years ago for the same reason the other people had rated this cookbook positively. I was disappointed with most of the recipes I tried. (They were rather bland.) The exception was the basic pizza dough, which really is a good recipe. I ended up purchasing Marcella Hazan's, The Classic Italian Cookbook, in search of better Italian recipes. Although Hazan's book lacks the pictures and large print that this book has, her recipes are much better. I would recommend someone looking to purchase a cookbook packed with Italian recipes to consider Hazan's book instead."
3,"Hard to find, but worthwhile . . .","It's a well-crafted slice of life that is both wholly alien and startlingly familiar to an American reader. The polycultural landscape of late twentieth-century satellite London is a vivid backdrop against which the lead character, Jamie, weathers the simultaneous storms of a dissolved relationship, the birth of several new and confusing ones, and a re-evaluation of how important his job with a local housing authority is vis a vis how well-suited he may be to do it. A supporting cast of Chilean political refugees, a Scottish artist, a homosexual housing officer, and an old-fashioned East End of London thug who ""turkeyed the wrong bird"" all make for a realistic, often funny, glimpse into England's new culture of diversity that is both refreshingly different from similar recent American efforts and surprisingly familiar for anyone who has ever had any sort of interpersonal relationship anywhere."
3,third time I reviewed it on the same day,"This is a very good book and an excellent resource for anyone looking for in insight into minority life in England. The story of an harassed Pakistani family is an especially poignant one when told through the experiences of their sweetly naive housing officer, Jamie."
3,honey I blew up the kid,Honey I blew up the kid is about a family who has a father for a sciencetist and one day when he tack his son to wrok and when the father leaves his son along he get he gets hit by a ray they are testingand this boy keep on growing and it is up to his family to bring him back to size
4,Picture A Poem,"Finding poetry that breaks free of the monotony of rhyming couplets or Seuss rip-offs is hard to do, so I feel obligated to highlight anything that holds up to repeated scrutiny.Few poetry books are quite like this multi-layered story about a cat and a dog making friends during a rain shower.Sidman wrote it as concrete poetry, where the lines take shape as pictures. Watch for free verses buried in the grass or woven among leaves and branches or circling the cat and dog.She found a fortuitous partner in Berg, who used simple shapes and flat colors to keep our focus on the words. But the best feat is with the typography, a favorite trick of graphic designers even when it's not so central to the storytelling.A cloud starts out with a few pale, wispy words:justa tiny puffa swirl of frosting-cloudand builds to a bold-faced, fat crescendo:THUNDER-PLUMPED SEETHING MASS OF GLOOMY FUMINGBLACK BOTTOMED STORM BREWINGThis one's kept my son busy hunting threads of the story and he can't even read."
2,EZ WALL SCONCE,EZ Scone Wireless Rice Paper Sconce LightI bought two and returned both. One because everything was missing except the rice paper. The second after it was on my wall was very dim not nearly as bright as the picture and the electronics did not fit properly so it showed from the side. I was not happy with this product
3,Remote control??,"The technical description lists that this product has remote control, but it does not. I wanted this to illuminate our bedroom hallway when I get up in the middle of the night..so the remote control was the main thing for me because I wouldn't be fumbling around for the light switch. I may send it back. It is nice, wonderful color...but not what I thought it was."
5,Beautiful!!,"This is one of the most beautiful clocks I have ever owned! It is fairly small though, so make sure you display it without lots of other things to distract from it's luster!!"
2,Pretty Lame,"I was expecting more, but I guess you get what you pay for. The packaging was also very, very poor."
5,I'm Hooked on the Game,"Never in a million years did I think I'd get hooked on a game. Well I am thoroughly hooked on Tetris and find myself sneaking a game at every opportunity. It's fun, entertaining, fascinating... well what more can I say. I understand from my children that the ""old"" Tetris was better - less involved and with fewer annoying graphics, but I've never played the ""old"" Tetris, so I couldn't agree or disagree with that comment. Do yourself a favour and ""get hooked"""
1,sucks,the worst tetris game ever next to the tetris worlds on all 3 major systems lets face it finding nemo was by(thq)tetris worlds is by(thq)and i can go on and on thq makes some of the worst games i have ever played stay away from them.the graphics suck the game doesnt even have a save feature to save your scores and its hard 2 play when stuff gets in your way when your tryin to drop peices its horrible
3,"Mediocre, but somewhat addictive","I've not played Tetris on the small screen Game Boy/Advance before, so I can't compare this to other such products, but compared to other Tetris products, this one will do in a pinch. If you need a mindless, semi-challenging game for a long car ride or to kill an evening at home, then this will do it--if you don't go blind in the process! Maybe I'm just too old for the Gameboy."
1,A very colorful and vibrant disappointment,"While the game looks great, the 'Tetris' fun is gone. The fun of Tetris is getting better and improving yourself. But there is no recording of scores in this game. I own Tetris DX for the GBC and my wife plays that. I bought this game for her, but since you can't save your highscores the impetis for challenge is gone. At least with Tetris DX you can camp away for hours chipping away at all the records.Tetris Worlds is pretty graphically and the new modes are fun, but the features found in more primative versions of Tetrix (i.e. DX) should have been incorporated into this version.Buy Tetris DX instead."
3,Could of Been Great,"If they would of simply made this the same as the classic tetris game from gameboy, it would be great. It is really distracting to see three of the next peices coming instead of one. Also, when you get a ""Tetris"" (four lines at once), the classic sound is not there. The sound effect when your piece hits the other blocks is not there. Also, the blocks themselves should be more detailed. The detailed backgrounds are cool, but sometimes very distracting. They should of included the option to play the original tetris as standard, instead you must put in a code to get it to appear. When you play the ""popular"" version, the background is always ugly grey, and the game makes no noise at all when you score a Tetris. Worst of all, it does not save scores. I got a score over 1,500,000 and I cannot save it. At least you can choose the classic tetris music though, thats the best part of the game so it gets 3 stars instead of 2."
2,The new features ruin the game,"As the other reviewers state, the unnecessary visuals and the ""ghost"" piece placement icons are annoying. The ""hold"" piece feature strips out some of the challenge. BUT, what truly kills the experience is the ""quick drop"" function. Whenever you press (or bump) UP on the joypad, the piece INSTANTLY drops & places itself where the ""ghost"" icon is. I can't tell you how many times that screwed me over while I was manuevering a piece left or right. IT'S JUST TOO EASY TO BUMP UPWARD. YOU'LL GET SCREWED OVER AND OVER BECAUSE OF THIS FEATURE AND THERE'S NO WAY TO TURN IT OFF!! Unless you're an absolute Tetris geek, I can't imagine someone so impatient that normal speed drop (when you hold DOWN) isn't fast enough!! This game is just no fun."
3,I like the orginal better,What I hate about it is when you have a space under on of the blocks and when you try to fill that space with another block it won't let you. It is not the same. I have this as the computer game. I was hoping for the origional Tetris music but nope it is different. It is annoying at times.
2,Not as Good as the Old Tetris,"This latest version of Tetris has a couple of interesting features -- but you won't find the old, familiar Tetris game here.The most annoying feature is the different ""worlds"" you can play the game in. The multi-colored backgrounds of these settings make it difficult to see the Tetris shapes dropping down.Also annoying for people used to the older version: No scoring. To win, you work your way through the 15 levels. If you come up short, you lose."
3,Little bit of an overkill,"Don't get me wrong, I love Tetris. I've been playing it in the arcade as well as the Gameboy Color.In the case of Tetris Worlds, the graphics are beautiful but they become intrusive to the gameplay. For example, in one scene a penquin bounces around while you are playing the game. Although its pretty to look at, its completely unneccessary.Its seems that the game designers tried to jazz up the simple gameplay of Tetris but they overdid it with the graphics. Another bad thing they did is that they never bothered to include high score save ability (The old Gameboy Color Tetris had this). Thats a shame!Its still a good buy but keep in mind this is definately not the best version of Tetris."
2,Good... but not Great...,"I wish I had waited to read more reviews on Amazon before I bought this game. It's good... it's Tetris, so you already know more or less what it's all about. But it's just not great. Tetris DX for Game Boy Color is much better. This new Tetris does not have a battery back up, and it does not have as many good game variations either. In addition, while they put a lot of effort into adding graphics and animations, it actually takes away from the game. I wish I could recommend it, but I just can't."
3,tetris for newbies,"I have been a tetris fanatic since I discovered it on regular nintendo many years ago. I recently bought a GBA so I thought why not pick up my old addiction? Its fun, because, well, its tetris! I do like that various game types that you can play that are available on this cartridge. What I don't like is that due the the color of some of the pieces and the background ""worlds"" you can play in, sometimes the pieces are hard to see. Plus, it doesn't keep score or save any of your progress, and thats something I miss from the original game. I think the thing that annoys me the most about the game is the icky music choices, and these stupid cube things that have eyes that fly around the background sometimes. I don't know what the cube represents, but its annoying as hell. However, if you aren't used to the old tetris, you might really enjoy it."
4,Not bad,"This game is okay. The game portion of the display takes up only 1/3 of the screen. The other 2/3 are graphics on the left and right side. At first I thought this would be a problem, since the tiny screen of the GBA gives me headaches at times. But it plays fine, and no problems seeing things. The controls are fairly smooth, but take a little getting used to. The ""Ghost"" feature is helpful. It shows you where and how a piece will lie, as it is still falling."
3,"Good tetris, Bad backgrounds","I just bought this Tetris game. I grew up with the black and white computer game ""Nyet"", before it was even called Tetris, so I love the Tetris game. The Tetris game itself was fine.However, the backgrounds were horrible - mostly dark, with animated animals and an annoying flying cube with eyes getting in the way. The distractions might be good for building my concentration, but the backgrounds were so darkly colourful that I had trouble seeing the blocks properly. So they were a) cheesy, b) distorted the outline of the tetris blocks, and c) walked/swam/flew around a lot, so that it made the tetris blocks even harder to see.I bought this game despite the mostly negative reviews because there wasn't another tetris gameboy advance game at the stores around my place. So it's enough to satisfy my Tetris fix, but I really wish it were better. That is, simpler, like white blocks on a black background, so I could concentrate on the game more than the bad graphics"
4,Irritating Background,"The gameplay is slow and the background is very distracting and irritating. Fishes, shapes, etc fly around the background and it kinda distracts you while you are trying to play. I rather have the Tetris DX version for the color gameboy. Another feature not added in this version is that there is no saved high scores. On the DX version, all your high scores are saved so that you can try to beat it the next time you play. Not Recommended. Sorry!!!"
3,ok game,I loved tetris DX but without the saving of the scores it takes some of the fun out of it. The grapics are cool and i like the new modes. This is a good game but not as good as tetris DX
4,Tetris!,"This Game is incredible! It came super fast, and I really enjoy playing it. Im very excited to have a piece of my childhood back with me!"
5,A pleasure,I was looking for a set of windchimes for our front porch. The audio clip sold me on this particular tuned set and I am tremendously pleased with the new porch sound.
4,Interesting and easy to read.,"I very much enjoyed reading this book. It was very easy reading and went very quickly. While the author had some very interesting stories to tell, however, I think the publisher did him wrong for publishing it as is. There are a lot of editing mistakes and typos within the context that at times can make it somewhat difficult to follow. However, despite these mistakes, I highly recommend the book to anyone who is interested in law enforcement, especially in L.A. I'm sure it would be an eye opener. I never realized how violent a city L.A. could be."
1,Garbage,"An incredible waste of money. A poorly put together, slow read. No value. You can have my copy. Pick up the book ""Boot"" for a naive view of police work. I thank Amazon for recommending Boot after I bought this waste. Boot redeemed their system. Thank you Amazon, sorry Bentley, pick a new trade, Godspeed"
5,"Betty, I remember you well","Let's go back to 1949. My parents purchased our first television. It was calleda Muntz and the screen was oval shaped and the screen was lime green. We watchedgreen people! Betty was on a show called the Make Believe Ballroom with Al Jarvis,a famous disc jockey in that time period. Betty was the phone girl with lots ofspunk and laughter. In 1953, she took over the show. Then came Life with Elizabethwith the great actor Del Moore. To watch them again, is such a prize! Oh, we hadthe black and white TV, thank God! The Muntz died! Betty has always had great talent, that makes her popular immediately. This was simpler times for TV programming, but programs were very well written in good taste, for all to view.Betty and Del are great together and make a perfect couple. You will love it!After the program, Betty comes out and says goodbye, finishing with a funny joke.Then we see the live audience, who are all clapping and laughing."
2,picture deceiving,The picture of the chime was deceiving. What I thought was pretty glass ended up being cheap aluminum foil.
1,"This unit is ""NOT"" ringing my chimes","I bought these chimes for my wife's walking path in the front of the house. Recently we had very heavy winds followed by rain. During the heavy wind storm the chimes did not even sound at all. These chimes are definitly not worth the money it cost me. If it wasn't for the cost of returning this junk, I would have sent it back the very day I took it out of the box. I can get better sound from three empty soda cans tied with string. Stay away from this one."
1,Broke after a month,"I bought this pouch for my dad. When I got it it looked pretty cheaply made, but for $2 + shipping I didn't really care. After a month the belt clip ripped off from the case. Buyer beware."
4,a great deal,purchased for a samsung phone other then the ones listed but easily altered to fit by inserting a small strip of adhesive backed foam.
4,Very good analyzed,This book offered a very good description of the related problem. All the aspects of the problem are explaned in details.
1,Disapointing,"This 84 page book is evenly divided between intstructions on how to build a brick oven and recipes for baking in it. I have not tried the recipes. I made an impulsive purchase of this book because I have been interested in building a brick oven for some time. I mistakenly thought that I would gain some insights and practical tips that were missing from The Bread Builders by Daniel Wing and Alan Scott. I did not. There is, in my opinion too little detail in this book to actually construct a quality oven."
2,Would not be my first choice,Not what I hoped it to be. Not detailed enough to build a brick oven based on this book. The Bread Builder is a better book which I would recommend.
5,Soothing and soulful windchimes,"I love the comforting sounds that come from these windchimes. This is the second set of Woodstock Chicago Blues Windchimes I have owned. These windchimes have the most soothing and soulful music I have ever heard. These chimes do not have the tinny, irritating pings so many other windchimes have. All my neighbors love them too!"
1,Useful Bio- but very slanted,"For those interested in the early maritime movement, this is an easy read, provides good background,and may serve to help one grasp the early maritime struggles. However, there are no notes, nor a bib. Berwick paints Furuseth as pratically the greatest man since Jesus Christ. Well, I suppose it is mentioned that he was stubborn, and could not differentiate between a communists, and a wobblie, however Old Andy's flaws are underplayed. Try seeking William Camp's San Francisico; Port of Gold for information on the 19th century and Bruce Neslon's Workers on the Waterfront, for a more detailed, and balanced view of the maritime movement in the 20th century."
2,I had higher expectations,"The author has established a solid reputation by co-authoring several great books on the boxer rebellion. Thus I had purchased this volume with very high expectations as to its contents.I was however disappointed by the text which was very choppy with some grammatical errors. I had the distinct feeling that the text was pre-written and then force-fitted into the Osprey format. If space was at a premium, then there was unnecessary duplication of information such as the order of battle for the forces, allied and Chinese in the text, repeated in a few tables.The face-saving grace of this book is that there were a few nice illustrations with one particularly compelling bird's eye view of the besieged Legation compound.In this series, an earlier Boxer rebellion book by Lynn Bodin is superior."
3,rock frame,"While the frame looked great in the picture, when it arrived, it had a much cheaper appearance. The coloring was off as well as the picture made it look as if there was grays and tans when in reality there was much more tans and orangy colors and not so much grays. Still not a terrible looking frame, and I like it overall. I just liked the picture of it much better."
2,Suoer Bowl XXV!! Dallas Cowboys Championship Video {VHS},"I like some highlights, Yet where is the Superbowl?, Not on this tape, A little disappointed, Please attempt to offer the real Superbowl XXV!!, With Michael Jackson halftime show, A very good game!!"
4,"""Worthwhile"" is Worthwhile","I don't have small children, I'm not a librarian, but I found Taylor Kirkpatrick's book ""Worthwhile"" to deliver a ""worthwhile"" message regarding the need for all of us to respect each other's sensibilities in a world where ""it's all about me"" seems too often to be the non-worthwhile focus. The illustrations, reminiscent of 1970's pop-art, effectively amplify the prose and provide a rich background to the important message: ""do unto others"". The message is an important one, and Mr. Kirkpatrick has delivered it in an engaging book. I liked it ginormously!"
4,East of The Sun,Also a good read this book was recommended by a friend and I found it very interesting. The stamina of some of these people and there dedication is amazing I would recommend it to others.
5,So glad I got this!,"I was considering both Hallmark and American Greetings software, but the reviews I read about compatibility issues with Windows XP scared me off. I am so glad I chose this one. Absolutely no trouble to use, the graphics are excellent, and there are so many projects! In addition to all kinds of fully customizable cards, you can make gift tags, labels, envelopes, gift bags, craft items... The list goes on and on. I made 2 cards and a gift bag the very same day I received the software. This will pay for itself in no time."
3,Tedious history,"The author demonstrates meticulous research in this book. This is the fourth of her books I have read and find her style clear,dull and somewhat easier to read than the Congrsssional Record.If you are seeking an accurate history with overmuch detail, Alison Weir is the author for you. I prefer a history book with a theme which holds my attention and doesn't wander into taxing paragraphs of detail,dull detail."
4,Filled in a gap!,"I had read a couple of books about Elizabeth I, and some about Henry VIII, but I did not know a whole lot about the time between Henry's death and before Elizabeth's accession. This book satisfactorily filled in that gap for me! Covers everything from young King Edward's reign through the intrigue that nearly got Elizabeth beheaded, the brief reign of the unfortunate Jane Grey, and Bloody Mary's years on the throne. The pace is very quick, and it's so interesting that it reads more like a novel. This is one of my favorite historical books on my shelf, and I've reread it more than once."
5,Extremely interesting and even handed piece of historiography.,"Most books you read about Tudor England was either about the sex life of Henry the 8th or a psychoanalysis of either Henry or Elizabeth. I can't tell you how refreshing it is to read a book on Tudor England that actually accomplishes what it sets out to do and good for the author for actually giving biographical information about all of the children and future monarchs.I don't know how many books on the period I've read that basically said ""Edward came to and he was sickly child who soon died."" He was followed by his sister Mary who everyone hated but thank the good protestant God Elizabeth soon came to the throne and England entered a golden age. The author even included information on Lady Jane Grey who always gets overlooked by everyone.Bottom line-A pleasure to read I will be looking for more by this author."
5,Well Written and Informative,"Not only was this an extremely enjoyable book to read but it was also very informative. The characters are well developed and Weir presents the material in a straight forward and organized manner. The cast of characters is large and the plots sometimes complicated and always intriging. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the world today and it's history. Obviously, one has very much to do with the other."
3,"A pretty standard overview of Edward, Mary, Lady Jane & Liz","This book was a dissapointment after reading Weir's excellent Eleanor of Aquitaine. This book is a fairly straighfoward accounting of the lives of Henry 8th's children (plus Lady Jane Grey) from his death to the accension of Elizabeth to the throne.There's not much particulary new in this book, and you would probably be better served by individual biographies if you want their lives in depth. In particular I found the lives of Edward VI and Lady Jane quite sketchy, with Elizabeth and Mary being better delt with.However, if you don't know much about this period of England's history this book would be an excellent introduction and overview as the author's writing style is very clear and staight forward."
4,"Ignore the ""creative"" title and jump in...","Fans of Alison Weir are familiar with her ""style"" of historical biography, and Ms. Weir uses the same style in this book. I rather enjoyed this work, finding many new details I'd never read before. However, besides the dull title, the work incorporates Lady Jane Grey as a sort-of ""child"" of Henry VIII, and the incorporation doesn't work. Firstly, the information provided about Grey is scant. Secondly, Weir (with her ever-present bias) turns toward the grandiose with Mary's ""glorious"" re-claiming of the throne...I really heard the blowing of trumpets and a burst of ""ah-ha"" strings at the court intrigue (fine in a novel, but a bit silly in historical biography). Lastly, Lady Jane isn't Henry's kid (!)...she stole the throne, albeit by her father's cunning and overbearingness. Flaws aside, I think you'll gain much by reading this one!"
4,The Children of Henry VIII,"Set during the end of the second phase of the Renaissance period, Alison Weir's biography of the four charismatic sovereigns is an enthalling tale of power, religious fantasism, and the tumultuous relationships among the heirs. Weir sprightly establishes the spirit and tempo of this work prefacing with a condensed account of the lives, wives, and reign of Henry VIII. By describing the four monarchs with such zeal, the author brings to life the four monarchs. This book is immpecably researched and written."
4,Wonderful book! Wonderful author!,"Alison Weir knows her British history and this book is another winner. Although not as perfect as THE SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII, this is an interesting follow up and enlightens us to the intimacies of Henry VIII's royal brood. If you're a fan, you probably already own it... otherwise, you will certainly enjoy their dramatic biographies."
4,"Very Good, Interesting History","this is a very good and interesting history of the three children and one niece of Henry VIII. The author is thorough, if not a little too repetitive for my taste. It is a little difficult to keep all of the supporting and fringe players straight, but otherwise it is a fascinating look at one of the most dysfunctional families ever!"
5,The Children of Henry VIII,"This is a subject relating to Henry VIII one never seems to read or hear about. Definitely defines how his children survived that period of history.Regards,siamnancy"
3,slightly disappointing,"In her forward, Ms. Weir states that this novel would be the first to look into the personal lives of the heirs of Henry the Eight and their relationships to one another.....well if that was PERSONAL then the heirs of Henry the Eighth must have known each other only as competition to the throne rather than siblings in the vaguest sense. I was disappointed by the book. While it was factually accurate it failed to hold my attention or provide me with a passionate look inside the lives of the characters. I suggest picking it up on a bargain table or borrowing it from a friend."
1,didnt work well,This did not work very well for me.... It only took off a small amount of the mastic and then left a greasy mess all over thee floor!!!
5,Calm 'em down,"I am not a believer in plopping a kid in front of a TV to occupy their time; however, there are times when ""quiet time"" in front of a TV is appropriate. Most importantly for me, these videos are both educational and calming; and, the selection of the multi-pack provides variety. I bought stage 2 first due to the subject matter."
1,arrived broken,Although the price is cheap- the scale I got today was broken and unfixable. To send it back would be the same cost of the product. Don't waste your time.
5,GOES WITH OUT SAYING,If you love photograph's of HOT HUNKS -- THIS IS THE BOOK TO OWN ... as always Steven Underhill comes through
1,Total garbage.,"How can they even sell this?! It's horrible! 40-50 ft pounds of torque, tops. Junk. Dangerous to have such a poor tool."
4,Ready for prime time,"I saw the Greenhornes open for the White Stripes a few weeks ago and over the course of the 30 minute set I heard hints of Black Sabbath, Cream, The Byrds, even Blue Cheer. This three-piece outfit has a lot going on in a cool, retro sort of way.East Grand Blues gives a taste of that. I hope this band gets some national recognition and puts out a full length record that showcases what they can really do."
4,Perfect Product For The Job,"This product is required to mount a scope to a Crickett rifle. It is very simple to install, remove 3 screws and the open sites, then simply mount this bracket using the screws provided. The mount is secure and a perfect fit. The Crickett scope mounts right on with no problems there either. No complaints about any part of this transaction."
2,sulfur8,"I tried this to see if it would help with my scalp psoriasis. I still itched all night and the overwhelming stink was too much that I felt nauseous the next day, and no matter how much I washed my hair I couldnt get the sulfur smell out. Maybe it might work great for skin conditions but I couldnt get past the horrible smell. It seemed to soak into my system and I couldnt stop smelling it on me all day. Horrible smell. I really wanted this to work for me since psoriasis is a horrible condition to live with but I couldnt get past the smell."
4,very nice,"I got this in black and I really love it. It's super cute and sexy as lingerie, and it also looks great over a cami and jeans for a dramatic look."
4,part numbers,"This is more of a listing of chevy part numbers and a brief description of each generation small block chevy. If you want to know which Vortec heads will fit on a Gen I block this book will not tell you. It's not really an ""interchange manual"" in that regard. It doesn't give you a head casting number for example and tell you which blocks it's compatible with, or which intake manifolds it's compatible with. This was what I was looking for and I figured an ""interchange manual"" would have that in it."
3,"Reviewing ""Rebuilding the small block Chevy"" by larryAtherton and Larry Schreib","When I purchased this book, I was looking for an updated building book for a person that has most of the basic information and experience to build a small block, but needs updated and preferred parts and newer methods for assembly. This book is fine for the totally ""brand new to the job"", type builders. It includes all the basic things needed, though the author seemed to be pushing certain brands of tools to do the work on the motors. It's just way to basic for my needs. Chevrolet has improved their blocks and I needed some concentration on the newer parts and blocks, while there was very little about the improvements made or the differences. I have since purchased another book that I thought would better fit my needs, but this book too, was a letdown. ""Chevrolet small block parts interchange manual"" by Ed Staffel, didn't meet many of my expectations, but maybe I'm too fussy."
2,15 inches including the string...,"Be aware that the listed size for this item includes the string. The wind chime was so tiny I was sure they made a shipping error, but measurement showed that the specified 15"" actually includes the hanging string and and wooden clapper attached on the bottom.I assumed the stated size was the length of the longest actual chime, but unfortunately it was an erroneous assumption. Think Stonehenge in Spinal Tap.It does make a pleasant chiming sound, and I found that Amazon deducts a shipping cost penalty for returns, so it wouldn't be worthwhile to send back- so I'll be keeping it.Suggest the description be changed to a more realistic 8""."
4,Wind Chimes,This is the second one of these I have owned. I leave them out all winter which is probably not very smart but I love the sound of the chimes!A very good buy for the price.
3,A decent chiminea made in China,"I saw a pair of these in Yosemite this summer at the Tenaya Lodge and thought they looked pretty nice. The top cap is what I was most interested in since I live in the forest now. If you forgive the poor fit of the accessories (front screen, air flow limiter below the front screen) and the fact that its another made in China product its a pretty nice chiminea. I guess my main gripe with Chinese metal products is the question of longevity of their metal (not the cast iron part) but the cheap tin like metal that seems to be in most of the made in China stuff."
2,Disappointed in New Hampshire,"I had previously purchased two of these chimineas a few years ago from ACE hardware. It is a great chiminea for the price and I've had no issues whatsoever. However, this chiminea is no longer available from ACE so I was very happy to find it on Amazon. When I had my first fire in this chiminea it became apparent there was an approximately 5 - 6 inch through and through crack starting on the left side of the front opening, and you could actually see the fire through this crack. There are also two more smaller cracks as well. As I am 68 yr old widowed woman so dis-assembling the chiminea and shipping it back is not an option for me. Obviously the manufacturer does not inspect the final product for any workmanship flaws before packaging for shipment or, perhaps, they don't care!"
5,Science in Sociology,"Sociology is not a science, but there are elements of science in the study of sociology."
3,okay bracelet,i bought this for my mother. don't know if she will like it. the bracelet was just ok to me. it was not handmade.
4,too many heartaches,"good honky-tonker. this has some real nice songs. ""texas honky tonk"" is the best song on here, and most others are good."
4,A decent update on retinal research,"This is a collection of review articles written by some of the leaders of retinal research. These articles are helpful mainly to vision scientists. While it touches on diverse topiocs, it is NOT a comprehensive overview of the state of the art, as it only covers the work that's recently done in the labs of the ~50 authors. Therefore, if you need a general introduction to retinal biology, get Rodieck's ""The First Steps of Seeing"" or Dowling's ""The Retina"" instead."
5,Inexpensive map compass great for the classroom,"I was really pleased with these map compasses.They were significantly less expensive than others I had researched - and they are tough! We have been using them with our unit on magnetism: 5 classes per day over the past 3 weeks. They are sturdy, easy to read, shock resistant; and best of all, the kids haven't demagnetized them yet. I bought 12 of them; we may purchase more for the next school year."
5,Great Price,Does everything I need and for a very good price. Keep it in my emergency pack just in case. Love It
4,great compass for the price!,Speedy delivery. The compass seems to be very accurate. When I first took it out of the package the needle didn't move. I taped it and freed the needle no problem.
1,Waste of Money!!!,"I opened the package when I recieved the compass and pointed it north. When I turned west, it was saying it was east. Not reliable. Complete waste of money!"
3,Best of the Goons,"I am an old English geezer who listened to the Goon Show on Auntie Beeb when it was first airing. It corrupted a whole generation of children, mostly boys though, I think.The disappointment with this album is that only two of the three CDs contain actual shows -- the third is a collection of songs and other idiocy by Spike Milligan. Not that I'm against idiocy, in fact I'm all for it, but I wanted the shows.I'd say that at least two of the show episodes on this set are top notch, and the others average in quality.Dick Jackson"
4,"Great book, not like the rest.","This is a great book, I was getting sick of all the other Love Stories where the girls are gorgeous and have perfect bodies. It proves that you don;t have to be perfect to fall in love. But the people are kind of unbelievably shallow, ecspellically Ben's parents."
2,Not too good,"I usually read books at least 2 times if their any good...this I've only read this book one TIME..you read it and you forget it, you think it's a waste of time. When I went to the store and read the back I thought ...cool book then I read it it really disapointed me and their really only on the raft for like 30 min, I think it's way to faire-tale like....a cool, hot guy would NOT fall for a fat, shy girl over a sexy model babe."
5,It resonates to your soul...,"I bought this windchime thinking it would probably be like others I have purchased in the past. Little did I know that this beautiful windchime would bring such joy when I hear it play. To me, it sounds like angels playing harps and it feels so good to hear it's song. I put this gem inside of my house and I touch it to hear it's music when I feel like I need to lift my spirits. Thanks for making it affordable, I look forward to getting another one soon!"
3,Wind chimes for back yard environment great!,There is a lot to understand about Feng Shui...a practice which Asians have used for many generations and which is based on solid yet unseen principles of arrangement which are affected by unseen energies. The lovely sounds of wind chimes offer peaceful comfort but placed in an artful location can shift the energies around your home and seemingly enhance the energy of those who live there...why? who knows...but faith in the age old practice has not occurred throughtout the eastern and now western world for no reason....Good idea to read about Feng Shui before dismissing it without respect.
1,No way no way no WAY,"Unfortunately for me, I couldn't sample the songs back when I bought this TRASH. If you wanna know how I really feel, go check out my review for their horrible Brown Bag LP. If you don't really care to, at LEAST, do yourself a favor and SAMPLE THE SONGS BEFORE YOU BUY THIS TRASH.By the way, anyone who compares Mobile Estates to Smashmouth has no idea about anything concerning music. The only similarity is good production. I wasn't into ""Better Days"" when I heard it on the radio, but someone made me listen to the whole album and it was pretty amazing.Go buy Mobile Estates; it's cheaper anyway."
1,dissapointed,I purchased this for a gift to a dear friend and when she unwrapped it the look was enough. I found the item to be rather insignificant in size. The hummingbird seemed to be the largest piece of the entire windchime and I was embarrassed by the rather tiny size of this chime. Once we hung it outside the wind never did move the chime nor did it play a sound though it was quite a bit windy. Sounded ok when we walked outside and it was moving in our hands.
4,Toastie Toes highly recommended,"This is a fantastic product for anyone who has cold toes/feet and can't find any other way to warm them. I have tried battery heated socks and they just don't compare to the warmth of these toastie toes. Also, the adhesive pad sticks to your socks and there is no slippage in your shoes. I would definitely recommend these. The only downside is that they are not reusable."
5,Warms baby bottles like a charm,I used this product for a different use than most. I would use them to warm water for my baby's bottle while we were on the go. Just wrap the bottle of water with the toe warmer at least 30 minutes before use and the water will be warm. I bought two boxes and only two sets out of two boxes were defective. Great product!
1,I must have received a defective batch,I must have received a defective batch. Only one out of about ten actually heat up and work. Very disappointing.
4,SATISFIED,NO COMPLAINTS AT THIS TIME. BUT WOULD LIKE A LITTLE WARMTH LASTING A LITTLE LONGER. AND AT A LITTLE EXTA COST. OG
5,warmth,Sent them to Afghanistan. The guys are guard duty were pretty happy.Delivery was quick. It would have been nice to send them directly but that is not available at this time.
1,Big disappointment in a small package,"My boyfriend works as a meat cutter for a grocery store, which means he is on his feet all day in a room that is about 32 degrees. Needless to say, his feet get cold, especially in winter. After reading all the glowing reviews I thought the ""Toasties"" would be just the thing to help him to be more comfortable at work so I bought a box. He opened one pair to try them out but said they did not work at all. In fact, he wondered if there was something else he was supposed to do to activate the heat; he said they did not warm up at all! What a disappointment. It's possible that the pair was a dud but nevertheless we are returning the entire box (less one pair of course)."
1,unsatisfactory,"received wrong product. Too late for intended use. Unsatisfactory response. You offered refund if I returned. Additional costs and inconvenience, should have been automatic refund.One star rating is not correct. Should be no stars."
1,Toastie Toes order,"I purchased 2 boxes of Toastie Toes for $80 the end of Dec. I have been buying these for a couple of years and have been satisfied. However, this time they didn't work well as well at all. They usually keep my feet warm for 4 hours or so. This time they were cool by the end of 2 hours. (may have been outdated or something) Needless to say I'm very dissatisfied.Pam"
1,HEATMAX FOOT WARMERS,As you can see (Amazon History) I've purchased these for many years and thieve always lasted six or more hours. The product package shows a 2015 experation date but after using 17 pairs from this batch 2 1/2 hours is the maximum time these have worked.
1,7 hours my foot!,Boy do these things stick to your foot! After 1 1/2 hours there's a cold lump stuck quite securely under your toes making walking uncomfortable. If they stayed warm for1/2 the advertised time I could have put up with it. Teriffic adhesive though. It took quite a bit of my wool sock with it when I ripped it off in disgust. Throwing these out when I get around to it. Tip: just take a hand warmer and lay it on top of your toes as you put your boot on. Works better and is easier to walk with.
3,A bit disappointed,"I've gone through about a third of a box and so far, none of them have lasted 8 hours as claimed. 5-6 is about the best I've been able to get"
2,"OK, but there are better",The toe warmers are not very warm. They are just OK compared to other brands I have purchsed in the past. I would not buy this brand again and would try other brands.
3,toastie toes,"this item does not seem to last for more than 2 hours,and doesn't work very well when temperatures are 0 or below.will not buy them again.the weather here is too cold for such a product to work well.0 and above you can feel some minimum heat.below 0 degrees its worthless"
1,These dont work!!!!!,"I have ordered these in the past and really liked them. They would stay warm for between 4 and 6 hours. This last batch just doesnt work. I have applied at least 10 pairs that have quit working after 15 minutes. Now I have followed all of the instructions on how to use them, plus I have been using these for years. I work with horses and its cold outside during the winter and I use these to keep my toes warm. They just did NOT work this time around. Not sure if they are an old batch, but I am having problems with both boxes I purchased. I cant return them now, because the return window is expired. Try another brand first. Dont waste your money on these."
1,Toe Chillers,Do NOT buy this product if your looking to keep your toes warm this winter; 2 hours after applying these suckers to my feet I might as well have put ice cubes in my slippers.Pay the extra money and buy a product that has a good track history; lesson learned and now that's what I plan to do.Here's hoping my toes come back from that lovely shade of blue that they are after taking the toe chillers off.
2,not the same as the store.....,"they don't all work they just don't get hot, and they definitely don't get as warm as the ones at the store, even thought they are the same brand....not sure how to contact the seller....."
5,Will buy again when I'm out,Such an awesome price for a box of these and I use toe warmers a lot. Will definitely be buying again when I'm running low.
3,"super hot, but they dont last long.","I tried these out for the first time this year at hunting camp. Its really cold where I hunt so I depend on feet and hand warmers when I'm sitting in my blind. Last year I bought a case of ""little hotties"" and was very dissappointed. I dont just put these on my feet. I stick them right to my base layer clothing to keep my core warm. Here are my thoughts:Pros:- get really hot- sticky material works well- sticks to base layerCons- Sometimes they tend to Bubble up.- Only last around 3-4 hours- seem to die when they get wet- made my feet sweat - not good for cold days.Overall not a bad product for the price. I am still searching for the right warmers at the right price to keep me warm."
5,FANTASTIC,"This product makes all the difference! I have Raynaud's and get Chilblains easily, so winter is tough. I do not know what I would do without these! For me a must have every winter, as they do keep my toes toasty warm."
1,Very Disappointed,I tried both Grabber Toe Warmers and Toastie Toes. Toastie Toes lasted for 2 hours tops! Grabber lasted 6+ hours don't was your money on Toastie Toes
3,Toastie Toes Work,"Toastie Toes work well. They keep your toes warm for several hours and the adhesive sticks well to socks. I bought them for snowshoeing and the edges hurt my feet after about 45 minutes even though I was wearing very thick mountaineering socks. I don't recommend them for hiking or snowshoeing, but great for keeping your feet warm outside for other activities."
2,What's with all the good reviews?,"Original bought it for my mom because her feet is cold all the time.Base on all these good reviews, I had a high expectation on these heat bags.After using it twice, my mom gave it up because she couldn't feel the heat at all.And it is taped under the toes that makes her feel uncomfortable.So I tried it my self.It does give warmness to your toes, but the heat is so low you hardly feel anything if you are wearing a thick pair of socks.Plus, it doesn't last 6 hours, it last at most 3 hours under very cold weather.As conclusion, I give it only 2 stars, below average utility."
4,Good buy,"I ordered this big pack to mail to my brother when he was on his first deployment overseas (he's in the army). He said he used them when they were out on night missions or times where the weather was crappy, and so on - and he appreciated that there were so many, he passed them around to his squad members too to use.I'm glad they worked as advertised!"
5,Toastie Toes Review,This is the ONLY way to purchase. WalMart sells Toastie Toes for $1.97 a pack. Costco prices are not much beter. This purchase brought the price down to $.97/pack. GREAT DEAL!!!!
2,"Work, but a few problems","These toe warmers do keep my feet warm, but I have a few complaints. First of all, the adhesive is far too strong, to the point that I've actually torn holes in a few pairs of socks trying to tear the toe warmers off. Secondly, if I wear them for too long they sometimes begin to leak iron powder out the edges. Overall they are ok, but I much prefer Little Hotties brand toe warmers (the only other brand I've tried)."
4,Tostie Toes are winners,My wife wears these all winter long. Keep her feet warm so the rest of her stays comfortable.Only problem is once in a while when removing them from her socks they break open.
5,Very good product,I live on a farm and use these daily for working outside. I have tried other brands and the Toasti Toes seem to work the best. They stay warm longer than other brands. This is something that I can pick up at the local store but the mark up is far too much and it's much better to get them from Amazon.
3,FOOT WARMERS,The foot warmers worked fine expect that it took awhile to reach maximum heat. They also did not last as long as advertised. On the whole the purchase was worth while and I am glad I overbought the quanity that was needed.
5,Great for biking and hiking,"We got some of these from a locak bike store for about $2 a pair. We love them for our winter bike rides as well as hiking, they are great for anything outdoor in the cold."
3,Herber Campbell (again),"This album is equally fascinating, in that it evokes an era now long gone physically, but is readily recreated in the minds eye with such releases. This album contains the fourth and final of Herbert Campbell's recordings.The liner notes for this release as with the others I've reviewed are informative. I feel I should offer a friendly warning here. If you approach these historic recordings with an open mind (to which history should always be approached,) you could become addicted.Keep smiling.R W Breen"
4,A nice surprise.,"Hildemaro was a Venezuelan interpreter of romantic Salsa music who recorded several albums for the TH-Rodven label during the late 1980s and early 1990s. This CD was his 1993 release and includes the standouts ""Mas"", ""Tu Voz"" and ""Al Natural"". Although all eight tracks on this CD have romantic and/or sensual lyrics, the music itself is more upbeat than you would expect from an album released in the early 1990s and Hildemaro's vocal improvisations are nimble and lithe. Just why Hildemaro failed to get greater radio exposure and more recognition is rather puzzling but if you can get this CD then I do recommend getting it as you'll enjoy it."
4,First-Rate Guidance for Writers of all Types,"Judy Dalton presents 29 rules aimed at improving writing ability with a focus on the marketability of one's writing. The book is brief yet direct, providing a very insightful guide that will permit any level of writer to improve immediately.Dalton asserts that too many novice writers confuse talent and skill assuming that talent alone is enough to be a successful writer. Just as in any other endeavor, if skill is not developed, talent is useless. Even the most gifted concert pianist must learn and practice before performing a great symphony. The book is centered on this basis and provides several examples of common writing mistakes to avoid to facilitate an improvement in one's writing skills.Dalton has a clear grasp of what is required to build a strong writing foundation as well as the proper attitude to produce salable work. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to become a writer and successful market their work."
2,Snaked by these chains,"I bought two of these chains. They have a very nice look and feel to them, however BOTH of them broke within the first week of wearing them. If you are a regular guy like me, buy something more durable and stay away from these. (Buy these for your wife or girlfriend!!!)"
1,Turned black within a week,This product turned completely black the first week I wore it. I was very disappointed because it was very pretty when I received it. Not a good buy for me.
1,Pretty Bad,"I bought this product because I wanted to load the entire product onto my PC and thus eliminate disk handling, but loading the 3rd disk of clip art was not clean.Secondly, making a note card from Avery 8315 stock (2 note cards per page) could not be created or printed. It locked up my XP machine--only product that's mucked up XP to date. Sent an email to 'Ask a Tech' at Nova and haven't heard back yet. It's been 3 business days. Nova indicated it would most likely be one day. I'm returning the product."
1,A CUSTOMER MY @#!!#,"SINCE THERE WAS ONLY ONE REVIEW FOR THIS ITEM, I AM BETTING THE REVIEW FROM ""A CUSTOMER"" WAS ACTUALLY BETSY HERSELF. I KNOW THE GIRL AND IT IS VERY LIKE HER TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS......."
1,Not worth it.,"It will blow your fuse every time! If not, it will melt your housing. BTW, not really all that bright, either. Only so much power will run through those tiny wires!"
1,Only One Bulb,"The bulbs are fine for what they are. However, I was expecting the bulbs to come as a pair. The single light bulb comes in a big box with a place for two bulbs. I suggest customers do some shopping because these bulbs usually come in a pair. My low rating is for Auto Barn. I will not do business with this company because now they do sell these bulbs as a pair for just a little more than a single. Oh, and they don't have singles any more. There is even a picture of a car backing up and it has two backup lights shown. This is deceptive."
4,Good Core,This core is of very high quality but I only gave it 4 stars since it is not as heavy duty as the original I removed. I think this will last the life of my Jeep
2,Incorrect item number,"The title says 100 count- its actually got 22 in the box. Great job, guys.Otherwise, they're your typical ring terminals. Decent quality, but not worth the extra 5x cost!"
4,Don't Stop There!,"A delight and a disappointment. Steven Johnson opens the door (briefly) to many of the brain's multi-level functions and then closes it before the reader can fully grasp the significance and inter-relation of the areas and functions. True, the end-papers do help but I'm still left than more questions than an answers. Maybe it's really a ""teaser"" for the sequel.Still, I would recommend it for anyone like myself who is interested in the how the brain functions but doesn't have a Phd in the neurosciences."
3,Cognitive Psychology Lite,"This is a nicely written but fairly insubstantial book on cognitive psychology, filled with personal anecdotes (prepare to hear about Johnson's children on every third page) and tentative attempts at practical advice. Johnson is particularly intrigued by biofeedback and the fact that an fMRI test confirms that he's generally smart but ""no rocket scientist."" The book should be subtitled, ""My Very Short Experience as a Cognitive Psychology Dilettante."" Steven Pinker blurbed the book, and readers who are interested in something more substantial should follow that link to Pinker's own work, particularly How the Mind Works."
5,Good read,"read it for class, it was informative and made text book neuroscience a lot easier to read and interpret."
1,not too thought provoking,"what appeared to be a good read from the description, in all reality, proved to be a bunch of poorly connected ideas that all in all did nothing to enhance my understanding of the functioning of the human mind."
5,Dr. Michael L. Johnson,"In one word.......Brilliant! If you're interested in why we do the things we do, author Steven Johnson covers it. He does an excellent job researching his findings, even putting himself through a scan of his own brain. I recant my one word review to TWO: Brilliant and Superb!!! Thank you Steven!--Dr. Michael L. Johnson, author of ""What Do You Do When the Medications Don't Work--A Non-Drug Treatment of Dizziness, Migraine Headaches, Fibromyalgia, and Other Chronic Conditions"""
4,Tell Me a Story,"Bomp Records has done an excellent job in releasing ""archival"" material from The Stooges/Iggy Pop and this EP is an odds-n-ends collection built around a trio of tracks - I'm Sick of You, Tight Pants (Shake Appeal), Scene of the Crime - from the ""Raw Power"" studio sessions, which are then presented live during stops in Pop's lenghty solo career.Tours from 1978, 1980, 1986 and 1993 (five total tracks) give a whirlwind view on how Pop used a familiar canvas, but splashed different paints around depending upon where he was artistically. Though the concept is intriguing, the CD probably has more interest to hardcore collectors than those looking for a firm foundation to check out Pop for the first time....but for the latter, there will be a time - soon - where the journey will end up at Bomp's authorized releases under the ""Iguana Chronicles"" banner, like this one."
4,Great CD!,"Despite being American, I have an absolute love of German music. So when I heard Niemals Mehr on the radio one day on the internet, I just had to find the CD. Having found the CD and purchased it, I find I highly recommend Oli P's O Ton to anyone who likes mellow rap and pop hooks. The songs tend to be formulaic, with Oli P rapping the verses and a guest singer singing the choruses, but they are all catchy tunes. Enjoy!"
5,How to get the book for less,"Although the original paperback print run of this book has sold out, the book is still available in paperback directly from the publisher, Oxford University Press, through their ""print on demand"" ordering, for $39, I think. No need to pay for the hardcover library edition."
5,Simply the best,"I have used many different kinds.None as good as this one.Very strong, easy to sharpen, replacement blades are available if needed."
4,Foo-Fighters Meets Kitty,Just purchased this album and have listened to it several times in the past two days. They have a Foo Fighters meets Kitty type sound. The chick singer and the ruff guitar make it pretty kickass.
2,Big disappointing finale to the series,"So I found myself disappointed with the last two booksof this series. What began as a book that easily made mytop 20 fantasy novels, RUNNING WITH THE DEMON, took a slidedown to the mediocre mud pits of fantasy.The main problem I had was that this book returned tothe hometown and created a watered down version of the first book. Whereas the first book had heart and emotionalresonance, this had neither. Whereas the first book hadsecrets and laid them out beautifully before revealing them,this book had none. Whereas the first book made me love the characters, this book turned me away from them.I know Mr. Brooks has done some excellent works. The onething I can think of in his defense is that he was writingtwo novels at the same time so doing both may have dilutedhis work."
2,Terry Brooks please stick to Shannara!,"Although this book is a page-turner, that's unfortunately about the best I can say for it. A long time fan of Terry Brook's Shannara series, I thought I'd try his Word-vs.-Void series. It was disheartening. The semi-religious overtones were more wearying than enlightening. Brooks is best when he sticks with the pagan world of Druids and Elves. I never became involved with either Nest or John, and actually found myself rooting for Penny Dreadful and the demonic crew upon occasion. At least they were interesting."
4,I Can't Believe It's the End,"Terry says this is the last in the series but again leaves us with the door wide open to another book. I sure hope he doesn't do what he did to the Shanarra series and skip ahead about 1,000 years...Anyway, this book at times was boring and mundane -- overly describing landscapes, etc. Readers of this series will be disappointed if they want the same suspense that was in the second book. However, the pace does pick up the last 50 pages or so.Another good book, but not his very, very best."
4,A book well worth reading,"Great book! I only wish it wasn't the end of the series. An improvement over Knight of the Word. The character's have more depth, you can see that Nest has grown much more confident in herself and her abilities. It may seem, however that the character's are a bit dense at times, and the plot is fairly predictable, but it doesn't do much to detract from the overall story. This book is definately worth buying!"
2,angel fire east,I love the book but it was not what I expected. It is smaller than what I thought and was looking for the orginal size. This is not what I am looking for since I have most of Terry Brooks books in original form.
3,"Somewhat padded, but overall a satisfying conclusion to series","A group of demons stake out Nest's hometown waiting for John Ross to seek her out. The conclusion of 'The Word and the Void' series.I have to admit, I enjoyed the first book in this series ""Running with the Demon"" the most, this third installment brings the series to a satisfactory close. The second book, ""A Knight of the Word"", seemed more of an interlude, but ""Angel Fire East"" brings the story back to its origins: the small town of Sinnissippi. Something about demons running around a small town (as opposed to a large city like Seattle, the setting in ""A Knight of the Word"") seems to be more frightening. Enjoyed it, but I felt the main characters made some foolish choices obviously meant to increase the suspense. Overall, however, glad I finished it."
4,Best of this series,"Angel Fire East is a better all around story than either of the two previous novels in this series (Running with the Demon and Knight of the Word). It is not entertaining or as engaging as his Shannara series, however. As always he does a good job in portraying the main characters, and leaves several surprises for the end. All in all a good read."
5,Best Terry Brook's Trilogy.,"I disagree with the Editorial Reviews. In my opinion this is the best Terry Brook's trilogy. I own and have read all of the Shannara books, andthis trilogy is superior. For me, all of the books in the trilogy were true ""page-turners"". I found it very difficult to put them down. I love to read just before bed, and many a night I would promise myself I could read only one chapter and then find an hour later I was still reading. I really cared for the characters - wishing I could spend time with them. The mood, the suspense, the settings - everything was perfect."
3,Angel fire,Not bad reading. Didn't hold my attention for long. Younger people will probably enjoy.Still worth reading if you like Terry Brooks.
4,Must read for any Terry Brooks fan,I'm huge TB fan and any fan of the fantasy genre should enjoy the Word and the Void Trilogy. This was a great wrap up to the series. Great read.
4,The Word and the Void Trilogy Book 3,Great ending book to the Word and the Void Series. Terry Brooks has always been one of my favorite authors. I can't wait to start reading the Genesis of Shannara Trilogy Next!
3,Super Reader,"Yet more time has passed. Nest is back in Hopewell, having been an Olympic athlete, and John Ross grows ever more tired. They must end up working to stop a demonic preacher, and a dangerous magical source from doing bad things to small town Hopewell and the rest of the world.Both John and Nest must struggle with the problems their own powers causes, as well as working out how to fight their opponents."
5,Fulfilling Ending to the Series,"I have loved this series from the first. The imagery is rich; the characters are well developed; the allegory is deep. So often sequels are disappointing. This is very satisfying. Well done, Terry Brooks!"
2,didn't get cover image,I'm very disappointed I didn't get the cover image displayed. Not having the cover is like getting a damaged book. Customer service couldn't find a solution to this problem.
4,A very real fantasy.,"In the third installment of The Demon Series, Brooks does a wonderful job of again captivating the reader and bringing them along for the ride. One never feels like a simple spectator. In this brave fantasy series set in our world and our time Brooks uses ideas and prblems we all face to create a fantasy yarn that doesn't seem that hard to believe. This is a riveting book, and I was truly surprised at the ending of this one (I had guessed pretty much the end of Kight of the Word). I hope that this is not the last installment in this series as there are so many avenues still to explore. I wasn't disappointed!"

5,Angel Fire East,"What can I say? I loved all three books in this series!! Totally recommend it to anobody who likes Fantasy.Okay Mr. Brookes! Can we have some more? John Ross is gone (although it does not have to be permanent), but Nest still remains and the Gypsy Morph has so much potential!"
1,"AWFUL, AWFUL, GARBAGE","Most of the story lacks suspense, any sense of danger or action. When the action starts during the last few pages, it's over quickly. The villian isn't too tough and is quickly defeated."
2,Pass - A total disappointment,"Wow, that was terrible. The main villain's description appears to have been written immediately after watching Poltergeist 2 as they're the same bad guy. Brooks has gone past foreshadowing to 'forehammering' upcoming events into the readers brain. As opposed to a cast of millions, Terry has relied on a cast of morons. The plot drags, the writing is ineffectual, the main characters are dull and lifeless. I highly advice spending your money and time elsewhere."
2,Angel Fire East drifted too much West.,"To sum up this book: I've seen all these moves before. There is nothing fresh in this tale, and with the same predicatable ending accorded to all dumb as post heroes and heroines, it's a sure bet to leave the reader in a coma. Question: Is Terry Brooks trying to be another Stephen King, one wonders? If so, he should cease and desist at once. Because this novel too is filled with annoying dimwitted heroes, villains, etc., much the same as SK's stuff has been lately.You know, guys, It is hard to go through a novel following the antics of characters with extremely low IQs -- very tedious and dreary. They keep doing really stupid blunders that you can see a mile away even before the author has the chance to write them down. Oooh! Aaaaahhh! Surprise, surprise!*yawnnnnnn*Very predictable, very boring tale -- like ""The Phantom Menace,"" which was a super dog of a story. Woof-woof! Dull-dull extremely, excruciatingly dull, boys and girls."
1,Yet more rehash!,"More of the same old same old as the first two books in the series. Come on Brooks, let's see something original! I hope this is the last book in that series because anything else would be a waste of paper."
1,Zero stars,"PASS! Juvenile. Story was uninteresting. Characters had zero dimension. A WASTE. Slow, boring and zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
1,A waste of time,This book will bore you to tears. For all the books he has written Brooks has only produced a few readable books. This isn't one of them. I don't know why I even bothered. Save your money.
4,spring,Their clear soft melody is not so loud as other chimes. But it has its own charme. Personally I prefer the autumn and winter chimes because of the more open sound.
2,Beautiful sound... when you can hear them.,"I bought these chimes because of the beautiful tone they produce. However, it takes a very strong wind to make the chimes sound. It appears that the wooden center piece is set too far away from the tubes (i.e. it's too small) and the sail is a little small.I've seen other Woodstock chimes at Lowes recently, and those had different wooden parts that created a sound with a smaller wind."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I LOVE the SOUND of these chimes! They are tuned beautifully. And the wooden parts are ""finished"" very nicely. However, the strings holding everything together don't seem very strong. And the 1 1/2"" diameter circle you use to hang the chime over a hook is made of such cheap plastic I think I could snap it with my bare fingers. I was very disappointed in the hangar. When you pay this much for a hand crafted chime, you expect ALL components to be high quality. I reinforced the hangar with a spare metal hoop I happened to have. We shall see."
5,This Series Is Always A Great Read!!,"An over-view of the films of 1994 could be huge task, unless you are John Willis. Leaving no stone unturned, this volume again, includes virtually all films released in that year. From 'The Lion King', 'Speed' and 'Pulp Fiction', it also includes foreign as well as doccumentaries. Including a huge section on previous academy award winning actors, actresses and every technical award known, this book includes it all. Included are hundreds of pictures. Another awesome job!"
1,DO NOT BUY.,Lyrics of first song talk about putting a gun to your head. A child actually looks at the camera and puts his finger to his head (couldn't be more than 7 yrs old). Thank God I was watching it with my daughter. It is now out of our house!!!
3,Boring movie,The item arrived in good condition. No problem. The content of the movie I found to be boring and not worth the money.
2,"Good ideas, poor execution","I've read and reviewed most of the basic tellings of ""The Three Little Pigs"", as well as most of the variants. Here's my take on it.This variant has a great premise of dinosaurs instead of pigs. It sticks with the plot enough to be familiar, but adds plenty of intriguing new twists. However, it just isn't very well carried out. The dialogue is inane, and it contains many attempted jokes that just aren't funny. For example, the T. Rex continually calls the dinos ""pigs"", which is out of place to the extent that I thought it was a typo the first time. The artist is obviously very talented (see the candy bar on page 2) but the pictures are really too cartoony, and the scale keeps changing. How big is the T.Rex compared to the young dinosaurs? It's too bad Harris couldn't have spent more time on this story and developed a better done version."
5,Wonderful product!,As I have gotten older my heels have become hard and cracked. This cream applied once a day has helped to soften them a lot. I couldn't do without this product. It's much better than any of the lotions I've bought in retail stores.
4,Urea in-20,The cream helps me with my chronic eczema.I wish the company would make the 10% urea cream without fragrance. The 20% without fragrance is a little strong but it is better than other urea creams for me.
1,I want my money back,It didn't work so I plan to try something else I think they sent me some old stuff that was the shelf for a long time
4,Came quickly,Works great on extra dry skin.especially on dry feet.The Ureatic acid is the key ingredient that makes it work so well.
1,Worthless book promoted by spam. Don't buy.,"I also received the spam promoting this book. I'd love to know how they got my email because, unlike they imply, I don't frequent book chats.This is the lowest form of promotion. Don't fall for it.It's also funny that a spammer needs to resort to using other peoples ideas (Harry Potter) for a book idea. Pretty pathetic."
1,F-ing Spammers,"This book has to be garbage. Spamming people to sell it, do I need to say more? But I will, the spam was written in such horrible English I can only imagine how the book was written."
1,Spam email needs a much better writer,"The spam email sent out seems to have been written by someone for whom English is a recently acquired language, or perhaps even auto-translated using an online translation service.While I wish all struggling authors well, please use this as an example of things to avoid in marketing your book.I could forgive a spam email, as I have purchased a similar book by a different author, so it is targeted. But I can't forgive one that is so poorly written.A parody should be funny, the spam mail should have been witty and funny. It should definitely have included a few sample paragraphs from the book so we could get the flavor of the book. Show us, don't tell us."
4,Loved every minute of it.,"I loved every minute of it. The writing was excellent, the romance was great, but I especially loved the historical information it offered. The author is clearly an historian of the first order as well as a gifted storyteller. I await the sequel anxiously."
2,Tuscany by Deborah Johns,"I read this book under the recommendations of my sister, who helped the author with this book, and found it very, very disappointing. I read many novels like this and found it lacked a good storyline that ended with a big gap in the ending, which was probably left open to insure that there would be a sequel. It was a waste time, and my sister's for having part in it. I do not suggest this book to anyone as it is not worth the $5.00. The author and her friend from Rome need to read their own book before writing their own reviews."
5,Dont read the BAD reviews of the Idiot below.,"This game has been a blast. I do not understand the reviews below that are negative. The tracks are challenging, and short or long enough to keep your attention.Online gameplay is alot of fun. Definately go out an buy this game."
1,The LCD is on - but nobodies home,"ATV Offroad Fury BT feels just plain odd to play. The detachment between bike and race track is uncanny. Have you ever seen one of those old movies where the actors are sitting in a car that is obviously in front of a screen having the image of a road projected onto it. Well if you have, that is exactly how ATV comes across. Its like the track is doing its thing and the bikes are stuck on top doing there thing with no real connection between the two. Odd, just plain odd. While ATV is at best average, the sound is dire, even with the headphones plugged in.This is one PSP racer not worth adding to your collection."
1,Not as good as Space Invaders on the Atari 2600,"Not as good as Space Invaders on the Atari 2600Not as good as Space Invaders on the Atari 2600, but to play fair Space Invaders is an all time true classic, where as ATV Off Road is far from being a classic, ATV is light-years away from being a true classic. Sony's ATV Off Road for the PSP is way way below average; it is right down near the bottom of the pit of trash games. Words fail me in attempting to come close to describing just how boring, monotonous, un thought about ATV really is. Did anyone actually bother to put an ounce thought into the game? I think not!!!Ok, so ATV is not original, ok we could forgive the game if it took old ideas and did them well. But no, ATV takes old ideas and pulls them off with all the grace of an elephant on ice skates. The response of the controls that connect the PSP to the ATVs left me numb and frustrated. ATV is absolute! $""$""R$""$$^%$%^%^$%!!!!!Nice picture on the box."
1,Very ugly looking PSP game.,"Not being one to mince my words, ATV Off Rd is ugly in the extreme. The artists obviously need eyes tests urgently, some of them must be colour blind. Not to put all the blame at the door of the artists, the ugly look of ATV is matched by boring game play and sound that congers up a feeling of not wanting to be in that space, the space of the ATVs. The sound the ATVs emit is similar to that of a puppy abandoned out side a super market. In other words, irritating to the maximum.Still early days for the PSP, let's hope the future is brighter, as it cannot get any duller than this load of pants from Sony."
1,Non too happy ATVer,"Tear up the UMD disc!""Tear it up in more than 30 unique environments""The only thing worth tearing up is the UMD disc.""6 distinct terrain types including snow, dirt, mud, ice, water and grass.""Been there, done that, not exactly original, not exactly pulled off very well.""Multiple player capable using PSP wireless multiplayer connectivity.""You'll be lucky to find someone else that owns a PSP + ATV Off Road. All in all, a pointless feature.""See from both first and third-person perspectives.""ATV Off Road is ugly in the extreme and looks just as ugly from all perspectives.ATV off Road Fury equates to a pointless exercise. The control system is extremely unresponsive, the way the bikes handle; the player may as well be controlling a boat!"
4,IDIOTS?,"uh.. seriously NOBODY should listen to these reviewers. i dont understand them at all. sure its not the best game ever or anything, but 1. it looks great 2. sounds great and 3. plays great. my guess is that these dumba**es just suck at this game. if you like the ATV offroad fury games for ps2, theres absolutely no doubt at all that you'll love this game. the gameplay is no different, not harder in the least bit. and to top it off, the graphics and sound are amazing. all these low reviews are seriously not valid. im usually one to respect the opinions of others, but these people are just dead WRONG. their reviews are the only thing that is garbage here."
1,ONE FOR THE SCRAP HEAP,"The only Fury felt with Off Road Fury was the Fury at feeling Furious at wasting my dollars on what amounts to nothing more than a pile of scrap. The ATVs handle like all the wheels have been punchered, attempting to pull off stunts is near impossible due to the PSP button arrangement. Did anyone actually bother to play test ATV Off Road? I don't think so.Moving onto the sound, the noise the PSP makes while ATV is running is irritating to the max. Now I am not saying bike engines are supposed to sound pleasant to the ear, but the engine noise in ATV plays throughout the entire experience.If you're into this type of genre, then you'll be slightly intrigued. For me, I'll wait for another extreme racer to reach the PSP."
3,Not a good game,"I expected a little more from this game. The end result: I was disappointed and frustrated with this game after hours of play.It took almost an hour to beat 1 track in the championship round, and its only because I just accepted my 4th place loss and shut off the system for the time being.If you are looking for a challenging game with crazy controls, this is for you, but if you are an amateur (like me) you might want to consider looking elsewhere.I have been playing this game for hours and I'm no where NEAR even ""okay"" at it...I may get it in time but I don't like being frustrated for hours...these games are supposed to be enjoyable."
1,"Awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful game.","What an awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful, awful game this is. Atv off road fury is quite possibly the worst racing game I have ever had the misfortune of playing, there is nothing right with it, the game as no merits what so ever. The menu screens are virtually unusable having been so poorly designed. There is a whole game to be had simply working out how to start the game, how bad is that. Once in the game you'll wished you hadn't bothered to negotiate the poorly designed menu screens. Atv off road is bland at best, never have I been so bored playing a racing game. Sony have really failed to deliver with Atv off road fury."
4,Great ATV game,Have played all of the ATV Offroad games and have enjoyed them all. Purchased this one after the most recent and I was not disappointed. Great game and would recommend to any racers out there
1,Not as good as Space Invaders on the Atari 2600,"Yes, believe it or not, PSP ATV Offroad Fury Blazin Trails is not as good as Space Invaders on the Atari 2600. Space Invaders was fun, PSP ATV Offroad Fury Blazin Trails is not fun, simple as that really. Consoles come, consoles go, a console is only as good as the games available for it, and PSP ATV Offroad Fury Blazin Trails is not the best advert in the world for a PSP right now. Sony needs PSP ATV Offroad Fury Blazin Trails like a hole in the head right now, what with the DS selling so well."
2,"OK Game, PS2 Version Is Much Better","I was very disopointed when i bought this game. I had ATV Offroad Fury for PS2, so i thought i'd try this one but i really regret it.First, It is saprisingly hard to stay on thae track or land a comlicated trick. Since the PSP has different controls then the PS2 it is very hard getting started.The Controls are very messed up. It's hard to move and the game isn't very responsive.The grapics aren't actuall that good. When the Atv is moving it's doesen't look real, it looks very fuzzy.The soundtrack is pretty good, but whats the point of bying a game for its soundtrack.Overall I would not recomend this games. I would recomend ATV Offroad Fury 2 0r 3 for PS2, because this is a lot more fun."
4,Good game but slow ordering,"so about two days before Christmas i ordered this as well as a 4 gigabyte memory stick plus another game, now the memory stick came first the following the other game, BUT i have not got the product yet, which is frustrating because i was not home when the mail man came so they didn't leave the package or a conformation slip which the usps web site said other wise, i use to have this game and it is awesome, in my opinion its like the same one on the PS2. so this being said try not to use the postal service. if the postman is having a bad day they might decide not to leave a conformation slip. hope my game comes today."
2,Stick it where ?,"I have to say.. Im a Bit disappointed in this release. I am Very much a fan of PaulsLater work with Danger Danger. And I suppose I was expecting something along that line.This CD is Typical 80's Dredge at its worst. There are a few High points, For the RabidPaul Laine fan. But Over All.. This CD should NOT be selling for the Prices it has beengetting ."
5,For English and Non-English Scientists,"220 pages of Scientific English worth careful reading by anyone who wants his/her writings to be understood smoothly and unambiguously. Old hyphen-lovers and hyphen-haters, you are especially invited to enjoy reading HYPHENS vs. DASHES and juggling with the diversity of meanings! :-))"
2,any excuse to inject partisan immaturity,"While it serves as a decent english guide, I find this book to be petty in its partisanship. This is all the more nauseating considering the book is supposed to discuss scientific writing. I reluctantly recommend it to my students, but am looking out for a more mature treatment of the subject. The author needs to grow up (and this recommendation is coming from someone still in his twenties)."
2,Quick Read But Very Basic,"This book may be appropriate for anyone completely unfamiliar with Mountain Dogs, who also wants a very brief synopsis about each of these wonderful breeds.To anyone wanting more than that, this book will probably be a disappointment and not worth the money to buy it.I personally view this book as a waste of money, time and effort. And I generally advise others to avoid this book because there are much better books on the subject matter that are easily available.I'm still hoping the author of this book will write another edition of this book and expand with a much more comprehensive coverage of each of these breeds. Now that's a book I could be interested in. But this one? I gave it away soon after I bought it."
3,"Good overview, easy read.",This is the coffee table book. It's a reasonably quick read and discusses all the Swiss dogs.
3,beware,so i love how this fit my razr. I think it was so cute!!! but the problem is when charging it the charger can't plug in all the way and i think it destroyed my battery. just beware.
3,Soldier/statesman of the 20th Century.,"A nice little review of General Eisenhower's life. I knew a little about his life, but this filled in some of the gaps. Ike was devoted to America as seen by his long service to our country. He was also a team player, and assembled a very talented group of people to wage war in the European Theater. It is amazing that few people now know of the contributions of this great man. He presidency may have been average, but his leadership in World War II shows his greatness.This is a nice pictoral book on General Eisenhower's life. There is enough meat in this book to give the reader a nice summary of this great man's life."
2,Big Disappointment After Dog Eared Dream!,"I'm all for artists growing, developing, and changing, but this CD lacked the storytelling quality that drew me to Dog Eared Dream. I felt like most of these songs were essentially about nothing. Willy's excellent voice seemed drowned out by the music at times. The instrumental songs were excellent, however."
5,Fantastic,"A fantastic book, loved it! Great insight into the life of a drug addict, highly recommend.Easy light reading, couldn't put it down."
5,Hilarious,"Clever, witty and so ""laugh out loud"" it isn't funny. Her best book yet. There's particular humour in Rachel's self-deprecation and also in her relationships with the members of her quirky family."
4,"Rachel Walsh, the middle sister","This is only the second book I've read by Marian Keyes but like ""Anybody out there?"" it manages to be funny while handling a very serious topic.Rachel finds her life turned upside-down when her sister, Margaret, arrives in NYC and takes her home to Ireland. Her parents along with her sister, Helen, take her on to a rehabilitation home. Rachels knows she is not an addict, and only agrees to go because she wants to meet the celebrities that take their vacations at the ""spa"".Ms. Keyes writes with a great deal of feeling and empathy. I recommend this book highly!"
3,3 and 1/2 stars... good but not great,"I am a big Marian Keyes fan. I've read all of her books out of order and have thoroughly enjoyed all of them. I started out reading Rachel's Holiday and was instantly drawn back into the Walsh world. I loved how at the beginning of the book, Keyes has the reader believing that Rachel is not an addict and that everything is blown out of proportion. As the book progresses along with Rachel's treatment, more and more about Rachel's life in New York is revealed. The book got a bit dull with all the psychotherapy in the Cloisters, but as I got closer to the end, I couldn't stop reading and I found that I enjoyed the ending of the book."
4,Rich and Frothy!,"Endearing, warm, full of hope.Rachel's journey of self discovery and love, open a well of pain, guilt and, loss. However, she manages to stand for herself and learns to heal.A wonderful read.Thumbs up for Marian Keyes and her vulnerable yet strong characters.Deep and raw."
1,"Sorry, didn't grab me at all","I've read Marian Keyes before which I've found to be a relaxed and entertaining past time but, unfortunately, Rachel's Holiday just annoyed me that I only persisted for half a dozen chapters.... Found the main character too whimsical & whiney that I wanted her to go on her holiday and never come back. Sorry..."
5,A Great Read,"This is the first Marian Keyes book that I have read, and I loved it. I'm planning on reading all of her books, since I really enjoy her style of writing and her sense of humor. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn more about addiction while also enjoying some good humor and a great storyline."
4,Rachel's Holiday,"This was another great by Marion Keyes, if you are a fan of her you willlike this book. Easy read."
5,This is a stay-up-all-night book!!,"I enjoyed this book so much I've read it three times! I found it to be a very true-to-life story of an addict coming to understand herself and break free of her addiction. Rachel is a very likeable, very human character, and her journey to a better life is at times hilarious and at times heart-wrenching. In my opinion, this is the best of Marian Keyes' books."
4,Want to laugh out loud??,"If you want an entertaining story you can't do much better than this - it really is laugh out loud, funny but also well written book about a potentially depressing subject. Truly Rachael is a character we can all empathise with on many levels. The ending is straight out of a movie and although a little predictable , lets face it wouldn't life be lovely if it could always work out that way? READ IT! BUY IT! GET THE OTHERS! And watch out for her new book just published in Ireland this week - ' Sushi for Beginners'"
4,rachel's holiday,"I thought I would read another not unpleasant chicklit copy. I was surprised to find interesting the introspection into an over cuckoo's nest world, depicting in a mocking like style all the serious problems that overly stressed people are facing today. Definitely not a putdownable."
3,light entertainment on a serious subject,The plot was not exactly what i was expecting but then again I did not look much further than the title and star rating. Overall was entertaining and I did read to the very end. I liked the fact that the book appeared to be fairly well researched. Not the most exciting book ever but definitely an entertaining read.
4,Rachels holiday,I found this book an enjoyable read. Quite interesting listening to an addicts side of the story. Quite humourous. An easy read.
3,Well written but highly predictable,I enjoyed the characters and the witty writing style but found this tale of an addict discovering herself a bit light for the topic.
5,My FAVOURITE Marian Keyes,"Rachel is the funniest of the Walsh sisters, this book is just pure hilarity, as soon as Rachel realizes she's heading to rehab for a ""vacation"" her ideas on what it will be like had me in hysterics, i felt bad for her, laughed at her and experienced every other emotion possible while reading that book. Just amazing my favourite of every marian keyes book i've read."
3,"A fun, entertaining read...","This is the second book by Marian Keyes that I have read. The first was Angels. This book is wonderful if you are looking for a lazy day on the beach read. I did not come across any life shattering and moving excerpts, however I do enjoy a light read now and again. If you are into the whole chick literature scene I would certainly recommend this book for you."
5,Absolutely FABULOUS!,"This book is one of the best I've read in a long time. The main character (Rachel) always kept me laughing with her self-depreciating comments, and outlook on life. At times my intestines were in knots, and other times I was crying from laughing so hard. Great book if you just want to have a good time."
4,A Great Book with Well Developed Characters.,"Rachel's Holiday is a light, heart felt book. It has more substance and better researched than many of the British chick books out there. The book is slow to start, but when you get to the end you find out that reading it was well worth your time. The characters are well developed and so so the story. This book will make you laugh and it will also make you cry (for joy). A great quick read and highly entertaining! Now I want to read the other Marian Keyes novels."
3,Not what I expected.,"I was looking forward to a long weekend and a good laugh when I opened this book. I was disappointed. I certainly didn't ""laugh-out-loud"" which is what several of the reviews promised. I can't say that it didn't keep my interest, because it did, and there were a couple of amusing situations, but funny is the last word I would use describe it."
3,Drug Rehab Plus Love Life--Do They Mix?,"It can be jarring to be juggling the heroine's love life with her extended stay in a drug rehab hospital in Ireland. Of course, she's in denial for a good bit of her stay that she even has a problem. So focusing on the boyfriend she's just lost, versus new possibilities at the hospital, does pass the time. Keyes' does have a way of balancing the comedic with the dark side of life, which she does mainly pull off in this book. However, a lot of your enjoyment is going to depend on how much you're up for spending time in a rehab facility plus a denying drug addict's mind. This is also a lengthy book that could have been pared down. It reminds me strongly of Carrie Fisher's ""Postcards From The Edge"" but that book may have been enough for me on this topic. I liked both ""Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married"" and ""Watermelon"" by Keyes better."
3,"Mediocre on the Marian Keyes scale , but okay nonetheless","I didn't find this book as entertaining as Watermelon or Lucy Sullivan. But it was still a pretty good read. If you're a Keyes fan, you'll like it."
2,SO DEPRESSING.,"this book was sooo boring and depressing.I'm surprised I finished it.Rachel's (main character) experience at the treatment center reminded me of the book, ""A million pieces"".I bought ""Anybody out there?"" and ""watermelon"".I should have finished this book before i bought those books.I hope those aren't as depressing as this book."
2,Couldn't even finish it,"I heard so many great things about this book and I couldn't wait to get started on it. Get started was all I did. I gave up about a quarter of the way into it.Oh well. Ya win some, ya loose some."
1,boring and depressing,"awful book. even ms. keyes said writing this book was 87% depressing. if the author knows its depressing while shes writing it, then WHY would she think the public would like it? I guess i am simply not a fan of Ms. Keyes writing style because i did not like Watermelon either. This book probably brought me to my mental breakdown."
3,hijacked,"I do feel hijacked by the blurbs and my own expectations after reading 'Watermelon' and 'Angels.' This isn't a humorous novel so much as an addict tract, full of specious psychologizing and spurious AA conventional wisdom. Invited to a party, I wound up at a sermon. The material escaped from MK's control at some point, and she went along for the ride. (And yet you read it in a quick four sittings, didn't you, John?)"
3,"Humorous Light Read; Dark, Serious Subject","""Rachel's Holiday"" is similar in my opinion to ""Hunger Point"". Both books use a humorous approach to very dark subject matters; drug abuse and eating disorders. While enjoyed both books, I couldn't help but feel disturbed by the subject matter and the way the author told the story. I understand the author's approach and I laughed myself to tears a few times, but I did not get a feel good feeling from reading this book. It left me feeling oddly disturbed and I really can't put my finger on exactly why. Or perhaps I'm just in ""denial"" of thoroughly enjoying this book."
4,Reader,"I really enjoyed Rachel's Holiday. I wasn't really expecting much more than another chick flick book, and although you get that with this novel, you get much more. This book has all the components of the currently popular single-girls-come-to-terms novel and much more. Watching Rachel slowly begin to realize that even though she's only a ""social user"", she's exactly like all the other addicts in the rehab center she goes to.This book is funny, witty, sharp, entertaining, highly readable, and it even made me sniffle once or twice (of course there are some kleenex commercials that do that too, so don't read too much into that.)"
4,Must read***,This is a must read. Very light hearted and enjoyable style of reading. Relatable characters and great plot. I think this is one of Marian keys best books. I am a huge fan of her books but seemed to connect with this one the best. It did help that I was on holiday when I read it. It gave the book more meaning.
5,Yet another winner!,"Each time I finish a book by Keyes I declare it her best work; Rachel's Holiday is certainly no exception. This is one stellar book. As in some of her other works, Keyes takes a very serious subject (in this case drug addiction) and writes about it a way that is comical without making light of the situation. She is able to take the edge off of a touchy subject with a sprinkle of humor that makes her characters seem very real to life. Even though I do not share her substance addictions, I do share many of the same moods, thoughts and attitudes of Rachel. Once again, Ms. Keyes has perfectly managed to capture the essence of many of the single young urban women out in the world today. Bravo!"
4,Rachel's cocaine hell,I found that this book took a while to get going. Neither is it laugh out loud funny as the reviews claim. But it is one of the most moving books you will read this year (or any other year). At first I thought it was going to be one of those completely unrealistic books about 'how my life completely changed after rehab' but it's pretty realistic and you feel Rachel's pain as she wakes up and smells the coffee. This really touched me and I'm not usually affected by books. The emotions conveyed in this are definately real.
4,"great characters, plot fun & serious","Very enjoyable tale of a woman in denial about drug use. There's some very funny moments in the book, and some very serious ones as well. Location goes between NYC and Dublin.Characters are well written, and M Keyes did a good job having the point of view be Rachel's - so the denial can be seen through her own eyes.This book is good to read whether you have an addiction or not, 'cuz chances are you know SOMEONE who might have an addiction that might some extra understanding."
3,The usual,"Well, i have read a lot of Marian Keyes books, and i must say this was a good read.....funny and light, with just a bit of drama thrown in for good measure! It's about a woman who has an addiction, who doesn't think she has one, and meets many new and interesting people in a rehab facility that she thought was a fancy hollywood type spa facility. The humor as always is typical Keyes, and all in all an enjoyable read!."
4,Kept me up at night,"I'm on a Brit Chick Lit jag right now - working my way through Marian Keyes, Isabel Wolff, Lisa Jewell, etc - and this book really caught my attention. It's darker than the normal book of this type, but riveting. I found myself unable to sleep, wondering about what would happen to Rachel next, and eventually just got up and finished the book. Rachel's travels through treatment for drug addiction are fascinating, and very well written. Definitely recommended, but make sure you've a lot of uninterrupted time because you won't want to put the book down."
5,Marian Keyes rules!,"As a big fan of Marian Keyes, it is really hard to pick a favorite title. However, this particular one won out. Probably because it dealt with such a serious issue as drug addiction with a tongue-in-cheek attitude.First we are witness to Rachel's self destructive demise and subsequent transport to rehab. Just when it gets serious, Keyes livens it up with that wonderful British humor.My favorite section of the book is Rachel's initial take on rehab and reaction to others. Reminds me so much of the movie ""28 Days"".I don't want to go into much detail and spoil it for you but you are also privy to life after rehab.In short, if you haven't read this Keye's novel yet, get going!"
3,Decent read,"Liked the style of the bookit was an easy read, although I find that this author is limited with her characters and style"
4,Amusing and informative,"Although this book started off on a light note, the second half is dedicated to explaining what keeps an addict in their addiction. It explains why there are no quick fixers and addicts have to be bought to a place of self-enlightenment and self-acceptance before their lives can be turned around. A well worthwhile read."
3,Enjoyable,Not your usual chick lit. It was unexpected and handled a difficult and often ignored subject with compassion. I enjoyed the characters and felt engaged with their lives
2,Books,"Not a very good book . Slow read, not interesting subject matter. long and drawn out in parts. No No"
4,Fantastic.,"Of the four Marian Keyes novels that I have read (all of which have been enjoyable), ""Rachel's Holiday"" was by far the best.Now, I did not feel so enamored the entire time I was reading this novel.... Rachel is a very thick-headed character, and for more than half of the book, I was nearly wailing aloud with misery at her inability to see reality. And yet, reality is what makes this book so wonderful. The stark, harshness of life and family and love and friendship and emotional issues and addiction all come to light in ""Rachel's Holiday"". As odd as it may sound, reading this novel about a delusional drug addict made me feel more acutely aware of reality and the joy of living.This funny & poignant novel about another daughter of the dysfunctional Walsh family, is entirely perfect. I would most definitely recommend it to others."
4,"Very sturdy, nice design, NSF rated","I chose this aluminum pot despite the lack of any reviews because all the stainless-steel stockpot reviews showed there were a small number of buyers of even the highest rated stainless pots who experienced delamination or rust. That's not going to be a problem with this sturdy aluminum pot. Just be aware that aluminum is prone to heavy staining - particularly if cook something dark and delicious like collards in it, as I do. Were it not for the staining problem - not a big issue for me - i would give this stockpot five stars."
4,Bees Besieged,"""Bees Besieged,"" by Bill Mares is an easygoing romp with Bill Mares into the world of the American beekeeper, as things go in the early 21st century. Bill tells it like a tale, taking the reader on a journey into beekeeping. You do not need to be a beekeeper to understand this book.Bill talks and meets with all types of beekeepers, large and small, hobbyist, serious sideliner and fully commercial. You'll learn the major issues and the most serious problems in beekeeping today. You'll understand better why honeybees are considered, ""the keystone species of production agriculture.""""Bees Besieged,"" is an easy read for anyone who is curious about the little-known and still a little mysterious world of beekeeping and the beekeepers who do it."
5,Everything about adaptive control.,You can find everything about adaptive control in this book. This is one of the best graduate level control textbooks currently available in the market.
3,"Silicone Good, Pot Holder Bad","Works well as trivet, but as a pot holder it is too stiff & cumbersome. I was hoping to replace my traditional pot holders that always need washing, plus I've burned them on heating element. So, don't throw out the old - at least not until you find a good substitute. I'll try another brand & one more flexible."
1,Manipulating Fabric,"I am willing to try anything, but I found this book to be outof my reach. Sorry I bought it."
4,Beautiful....huge....a touch overhwhelming!,"This book is amazing. I wish there were color photos, but other than that it is great. If you are interested in manipulating fabric this is a great purchase. The details in it are wonderful. The instructions really are great. It is overhwhelming in the fact that there is so much information and some of the techniques are long and a bit difficult. A great purchase!"
2,Think Laura Ashley doing muslin.,"I read the positive reviews and had hoped to check this out from the library to give it a preview. Unfortunately, they didn't have a copy, but I was so certain that I would enjoy this book and be able to apply it to my designs that I ordered it anyway. While it is very through and well-documented, it is really meant for those with an old-fashioned ""crafty"" bent to their sewing. I'm talking frills and puffs and applique and quilting and Celtic knots, and lots of it. Plenty of grid-like patterns to be had for the quilting fanatics. If you interpret ""manipulate"" to mean painting on, slicing, tearing, knotting, or otherwise changing the look of the fabric itself (as opposed to making it puff out or pleated), then this is not the book you are looking for. Another disappointment were the black and white photos. Even though it was just plain muslin being photographed, I felt gypped having paid so much for what resembles a bunch of 1960s textbook photos."
2,I was uninpressed,I was very unimpressed with the book verse the description given in the advertisement. I think that the advertisement needs to be rewritten to more accurately describe this book. Had it been that way or had pages to read from each chapter I would not have bought this book. It's an okay book but it's not for me or of my interests.
2,Not Pleased,It's not what i was looking for. I don't like the format and the way things are explained. I have to say its not pretty to look at as well.
4,Very cool book,"Really liked this book, slightly dated but loved all the ideas. A little hard to understand some of the instructions. That's the only reason it got 4 stars."
5,unforgetable,"i have been sewing all my 60 years...now i also work with raw fibers for felting and embroidering...this book just took my breath away...so many things i didn't know...and that is saying alot...i was taught by the best, my grandmother, and i know she would be entralled too...i cannot say enough about the wonders in this book...it has given me a whole new way to look at sewing and fiber work...it really stimulates creativity...i want to incorporate all these novel ideas in my work"
3,More of an encyclopedia than a how-to book.,"First of all, this is definetely a book for experienced sewers. The book assumes you know how to do basic and intermediate sewing, and also assumes that you are familiar with many technical terms that are not listed in the book. If you are an experienced sewer, then that should be OK.My main issue with this book is that there is SO much information in it that it seems to be running out of room to list it all. Pages are laid out in four column formats only with black and white photos, mostly just of the finished products. It lists so much information, in fact, that I think it's more accurate to call this book an encyclopedia or a compendium on all the different techniques listed. It's really not a how-to book at all, unless you already know what you're doing."
4,Great!,Great book!Very comprehensive! Much more than what I expected and lots of variations and details.Think there's a lot of options I will be able to use for future ideas.
5,No-nonsense,This book contains a wealth of knowledge about cloth and how to handle it -- precisely what one would expect from the title.
5,Everything the other reviewers said,"This book is fantastically inspiring and absolutely thorough in the way that different approaches are explored - variations on size, type of pleats, fabric type, are all photographed wonderfully. I was left with a strong desire to make things right away!"
5,Helpful Book,"I learned to make cloth dolls by using Colette Wolff's and a few other doll designers' patterns, so I was very interested in her book on fabric. I had no idea how many ways there are to add depth and texture to fabric. Right now I am interested in smocking and stuffed quilting. Both topics are in the book and her explanations are as thorough and easy to follow as the instructions in her doll patterns."
5,excellent overview of many techniques,"clear, comprehensive overview of many techniques of manipulating the fabric - with pictures and explanations - would recommend it to any budding designer or serious tailor/seamstress"
2,"Nice, but confusing and unbalanced, and not for beginners","The book covers a myriad of methods for folding, pleating, gathering, etc., but is very inconsistent in its explanations of technique. Some are covered too well, while others are either very confusing in their explanations or glossed over, leaving the reader to figure out the techniques on their own. While I am not sorry I purchased the book, it is definitely not one for beginners and, unless one is willing to spend the time figuring out some of the less well-explained techniques, not worth the price I had to pay for it. Perhaps the author might consider updating the book to make it more accessible, especially for the novice."
5,A Treasured Must-Have,"Texture, movement, sway, swag... and more. No prints or color to distract from form, just the fabric manipulated to stand strong, or pout, stipple or ripple in the stream, sharply pleat, or undulate with pleasure. Particularly canted toward those with imagination, this is a profound source book for textural ideas to which I return again and again; a magnificent work."
5,many ways to change your plain fabric,"Colette Wolff said her working objective was to catalog fabric manipulation; what they are, and what to do with a piece of cloth, and how to do it.I make wearable art and bought the book for the many, many ideas both in photos and drawings. I want ideas to make my work distinctive.Most of the manipulation is done with hand sewing. The diagrams are good and can be followed fairly easily. There is a section on machine quilting.I could see combinations of designs being used in a wall hanging."
1,Manipulating Fabric lacks instructions,"This book has black and white photos of finished projects, but no instructions on how to create any of them. A person would have to guesstimate at how these projects are made. Very disappointing!!"
4,Very good book,"It has a very nice variety of techniques for making that piece of fabric ""something else"". There are more techniques out there that haven't been included in the book, but it's not an encyclopedia, just one book. I don't give it 5 stars because the photographs are quite small, and sometimes insufficient, but overall the book is useful an interesting."
2,Severely underwhelmed by this book,"I have been sewing and quilting for nearly 40 years, and I have taught quilting classes. When I read a review of this book I was extremely excited, and I wanted to have it immediately. However, when I opened it and started to read I was massively disappointed. Although the book provides a decent overview of major types of fabric manipulation, there are nowhere near enough photos and what photos there are often demonstrate techniques which are not detailed in the book. I found the book very hard to follow, and it seems that this is more of a reference book than a how-to book. This book could have been so much more!"
3,Ghoul School,"Timothy O'Rawe comes from the same school of film making as Lloyd Kaufman and the rest of the Troma Team, where less is never more. Every aspect of this no-budget zombie picture is exaggerated to a ridiculous extreme, with comically over-the-top characters, a goofy B-movie plot, and outrageous moments of gore. GHOUL SCHOOL enrolls a pair of would-be thieves who accidentally release a deadly poison into the campus water supply, turning the entire student body into a pack of ravenous fiends! There is no mistaking the film's many flaws, but fans of THE TOXIC AVENGER will find plenty to enjoy in its silly performances and intentionally terrible humor. With costumes and FX that were clearly influenced by Lamberto Bava's DEMONS, THE EVIL DEAD, and others, GHOUL SCHOOL manages to sneak in some impressive splatter for the budget. As Timothy O'Rawe's first and only film, it serves as a cheesy reminder of everything Horror fans loved from the 80s.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
3,small rain,The book was in the condition described and the dealer made sure I knew what I was getting...I was very pleased with the person ensuring that I understood that it was a well used/loved book....It went to a 14 yr old grand-daughter who loved it because of the wear as well as the content...
2,incomplete item,I received this shelf with wrong parts (my husband had to do a lot of carpenting work to remedy the problem). There were also missing bolts and totally wrong screws. Seems that the person who assembled it was very negligent. The only reason we didn't send it back was that it would have cost a lot since it is a very heavy item.
5,Whooooo could ask for more?,A snuggly gift for the owl lover..young..and young at heart! Sweet for the price...looks good on the shelf and very huggable in the arms..just like a good stuffed animal should be!
5,Lovin it!,This CD is just what I've been looking for. I think this artist is really going to make it big.
4,"Very good, the best St Johns Wort pill if have found",I was very happy with this St johnd Wort pill. It has far fewer side effects than the other st johns wort pills I have tried.
2,EXHAUSTING :(,"I ordered Perika after reading several good reviews about it. I have suffered mild-moderate depression for about 4 yrs and was grateful to find out that St. John's Wort could offer relief. This particular brand left me exhausted throughout the day. I felt like a zombie! I only took these for 2-3 wks because I couldn't deal with the low energy it gave me. I found myself taking naps when I normally would not. I do believe it helped pull me out of the blues temporarily. I have since returned to using the Henry's brand St. John's Wort, which works great without zapping my energy."
3,Sizing seems off,"I wear a 12 most of the time. Ordered these in a size 13. They were incredibly tight.. felt like an 11. I had toreturn them. The shoes are also incredibly stiff. Maybe that's a a good thing, but I like a softer shoe. Mainly I just thinkthe sizing on these shoes are way off."
3,Spira shoes,"I have purchased 3 pair of these shoes. I do love the comfort of them. But they do not hold up. The front rubber scuff guard has peeled off on all three pair. On the two white pair I have the finish has failed very quickly. The white ""polish"" is badly abraded on both pairs, particularly the front half of the shoe. The shoe is not worn out physically but is cosmetically. I am a self employed contractor and having shoes that look worn out is not an image I want to project while working in my customers homes and business. Will I buy anymore of these shoes. Only if I am assured the quality has improved."
5,"Tried all the rest,these are the best",Bought 4 pairs of these so far.I'm on my feet all day.Nothing compares to these peroid.Wasted alot of money on other shoes.Finally found the Best.
4,Fun Toy,"My boys loved this toy and it did come with a few refill balloons. After they were gone, so was the toy. I couldn't find a balloon big enough to blow up the cover completely. Wish you could get refills. :("
5,Balzac toy,"I remembered having this toy from my youth so I searched the web for them and Amazon was the only place I could find them unless you want to pay big bucks for the Disney version. I'm buying four more tonight becouse all of my friends want them. They're great at the pool, beach, or the backyard until you try one you just don't know what you're missing no other ball can even comes close."
5,love addiciton,great dvd - plus its not the same old information from pea melodie and bradshaw- i really think jef has a simple way of getting the message across without delving into 100 case studies like the others seem to do. this focus' on the information needed and gives in in concise format. most of the other materials on this topic are really drama soap opera type books with little help. we all know a ton of people we can relate the facts to and jef does just that. gives net concise information that allows for further thought and discussion with others. great material and also in format to englighten others that might not pick up a book called women who love to much or some other such title that can be a put off to the male gender. great material
4,are you in a unhealthy relationship?,"if you have questions about the strength and health of your relationship and where it is going, or wondering why you always seem attracted to the wrong individuals, I would say you need to watch this dvd.Mr. Gazley covers the dynamics of relationships, both from the healthy and un-healthy perscpectives; giving practical information about why we act the way we do in our relationships."
4,IF ITS CREDIBLE(WERE NOT ALONE AND SOMEBODY KNOWS IT).,"Enjoyed this australian version of sightings and abductions told from memory and then put into animated graphics.Doesn't go on for long though.Basically if its true were surely not alone and people out in higher places know it.However as one of the ladies on the dvd said I'd have never belived it if i haden't seen it for myself.REASON FOR 4STARS,,,,i;d would have gave it 10 if i'd seen something for real myself..."
3,"Interesting ""account"" of Space Invaders","While I have been interested in the phenomena most of my life, I have yet to come across a ""credible"" documentary that accurately portrays the ""scientific"" approach to answering questions on the subject. Perhaps it's because there are no answers, but a scientific approach would certainly go a long way toward allowing the viewer to draw their own conclusions. Encounters is an entertaining and enjoyable, if whimsical montage of events that tantalize the viewer. I recommend it for UFO buffs that already have some body of knowledge of the subject."
4,OZ Encounters,"I found it well worth watching, well worth adding to one UFO DVD file section. It seemed strange that I had to send to the USA for an Australian UFO documentary, but I guess that is what happens sometimes.Yours thankfullyPeter J Barr"
2,"pretty dull, zero footage","3 or 4 stories mixed with some good graphic representations. However, there's no footage and there's nothing shockingly new about the ""encounters"". It is interesting to hear the perspective of a few people who claim to have been abducted, babies taken, etc.. I still think it's military, and the little green men are hypnotically induced. Though this video would have you draw other conclusions."
4,lightplane vanishes with wireless account &more,"i have seen miles of ufo footage from all over the world , convincing ,but this is the first time there is one on where i live ,oz encounters covers high quality accounts ,very well made , never available in this country ,&there are many more accounts waiting to be catalogued but the openning account : charlies flight at nite over bass strait between australia & tasmania ,was it the myological nazi flying scaucer on a mission from it's supposed antartic base [see dvd : the aldebaran mystery ect]or aliens. light aircraft vanished no trace of wreckage ,&blow by blow wireless account by charlie, pilot this could be a doco in it's self [ i don't know how to spell pilot's last name]"
5,UFOs Are Everywhere,"Many myths are influenced the by the cultures the myths exist in. However, The Australians interviewed reported encounters in a very similiar way that Americans do, proving that UFO phenomena is a universal concept.From Perth to Sydney and in between, this video reports encounters by men and women from all walks of life; some believers, some non-believers, who have experienced UFO and alien phenomena. One man who photographed a UFO moving accross the Melbourne sky had his photos anaylzed, and the scientist found his photos to be authentic.This is one of the best documentaries about UFOs I have ever seen. If you are a UFO lover, definitely pick up this video. If you are a non-believer, pick it up anyway; it many change your mind."
3,Ok But Rarely Hear Bells Ring,"The chimes are nice to look at but I don't think I have heard them ringing except when I've manually tugged on them to make them ring. Again, they look great but don't expect a lot of sound from them. I have other chimes hanging nearby and those are chiming almost around the clock. In the end I would not recommend these if you are looking for something to add to your ""noisy"" chimes collection. If you are just purchasing for looks then go for it--although I think the price is pretty steep for chimes that don't actually chime."
1,Disappointed,"I'm disappointed in the Temple Bell chimes. What others might choose to call ""gentle tones"" I myself would just call ""weak."" It's been very breezy here lately, but these Temple Bells seem to respond very poorly. I'm not even sure the top two chimes are EVER activated, but even the clappers on the bottom ones are more inclined to just go round and round the inside of the circular chime as opposed to actually striking notes. I think it's a design flaw. Maybe if the chimes were triangular or even square there would be more striking and less stroking by the clapper.I hate to give such a bad review. From looking at the other chime offerings from Woodstock, many of them look like they would NOT disappoint. But this one did."
5,Beautiful,"This one is an absolute delight. Music to calm the wild beast!!Buy it, I promise you, you won't regret it. Instead, you'll find yourself ordering another one (like I have)!!!"
3,A little quacky-,"I purchased this CD for the cute rendition of ""Teddy Bears Picnic"" since it is difficult to locate recordings of this children's lyric. Several of the other tracks are entertaining also, but I'd suggest putting the CD player on ""shuffle"" to intermix other CD tracks too."
3,Too Many Songs,There's nothing wrong with Justin nor this CD but to my opinion thereare too many songs that are so alike that you end up bored. I love theTexas shuffle but not 22 in a row. Ten to twelve songs would have beenfine.
4,Pretty good sample pac...but not the best versions.,"I'm still giving four cause its the stooges and the version of Head on is great and there are some songs I hadn't heard on it like Gimme Some Skin. The main reason I'm writing this review is to disagree with what ""somebody who cares"" said about this being a great album if you have all three studio recordings. I'm sorry but this is just plain wrong. I bought it cause of that review and I already had the Stooges Studio Sessions and the Live in LA73 and both are better the Year of the iguana. The versions of Johanna and Open up and Bleed are way too short and lack a little umph especially in the backing vocals on Open Up, although its nice to really hear the words, I'd rather have the feeling. I would NOT recommend this as a forth Stooges Purchase, get Studio Sessions instead."
2,BIG disappointment,"I was extremely disappointed in my 2mm 24"" snake chain. I have bought several pieces in the past from Silver Insanity, but it seems they've decided to cut corners. I would be surprised if this chain measured ONE mm let alone 2. I have other 2 MM chains and this one is HALF the size. It feels very light. Not at all what I'd come to expect quality wise from Silver Insanity. I will not buy anymore silver from them."
5,Very Pleased,This chain exactly matched my expectations...it went well with the pendant I wanted to hang from it and I can slip it over my head without having to mess with a clasp. Thanks once again Amazon!
2,Flipsy Clasp,I bought this necklace wore it once and the clasp broke. I try to contact the retailer and I am still waiting. They have great jewelry and I buy from them all the time. I am really disappointed they did not call me back.
2,Cheap aluminum,"The arch is cheap aluminum, not wrought iron as I expected. I'll take the hit on not researching well enough, but folks looking at this beware. It's kind of flimsy and we get a lot of windstorms around here, not sure how it is going to hold up."
3,Works OK for the price,"I was hoping to find a multi-purpose dish drainer for the small side of our new sink, but this is the closest I could find. It holds heavy items, like a single heavy pot, very easily without bending, but has a limited capacity. It really only works well for plates or other stackable items. Cups and silverware don't have a place to rest without falling through the grid or off the side back into the sink. I would have liked a drainer that holds a few glasses or mugs as well. This one doesn't fit the bill. But for the low price I paid, I'm satisfied. It was either on sale or clearance at the time."
5,Very helpful for proper procedures and rules at a VFW meeting,Wish they would make an electronic version of this book. Especially if you were able to do a unique word or search for topics.
4,What a workout!!!!,"In all fairness, I only used thiis Pure Barre DVD only a few times before deciding I need to get a bit more in shape before I pull this out again. THAT said, for someone in decent shape I truly believe this is an amazing workout. My daughter in law has attended Pure Barre classes and says her thighs have never burned more - I believe it because my thighs were actually shaking. The setting of this DVD is very serene and the instructor does a great job. If you are good at doing doing modifications even a fairly fit beginner might be able to do this - instruction for modifications are provided. I just tend to overdo so this will just have to wait until I build up a bit further. After that.....watch out - this will be the first DVD I grab."
2,Nothing new,This is a very basic workout consisting mostly of Pilates Mat exercises. I was not fond of the getting up and down off the floor throughout.
5,Best workout EVER,"Started with this DVD, now I'm a teacher at a studio. Nothing has ever changed my body like this. LIFER!"
3,Good workout - OK DVD,"I typically work out using my computer and it has great sound (it works well with Insanity, Turbo Fire etc.) so I figured it would work well with this DVD. I cannot hear the instructor half of the time - which really aggravated me. I feel like if they can charge $25 per class then they could afford to have better sound/video.That aside - the workout IS ROUGH. It really took me a while (between this DVD and mile high 1 DVD) to get through this one. (the Mile high dvd is about 34 mins and this one is longer).With that said - I ended up buying Pershing Square 2 which is supposed to come in the next few days!!!"
3,Not what I was looking for,"I was disappointed with Pure Barre: Pershing Square 1 because it wasn't ""pure barre"". The workout is great but I was looking for something with real barre work. I am a dancer and was looking for something that I could follow along at home with when I'm not in classes; barre excercises that would challenge me. If you are not a dancer, this is a great workout but if you are, it's nothing but a workout and has little, if anything, relatable to barre. If anyone knows of a good at home barre workout dvd, please post a review response and let me know."
3,Pilates with a small ball,I was a bit unhappy to get the DVD in the mail and get ready to workout only to discover I needed a Pure Barre ball. I did not see that anywhere when I purchased it and it does not say anything on the outside of the tape.I was expecting more ballet or a better mix of ballet and pilates. It seems to be mostly pilates only with a small ball. It is still a good workout though.
3,Nice but kinked,"The necklace arrived quickly, but it was kinked in a couple of spots. I'm not sure if this is typical for this type of chain and I was able to carefully remove the kinks, but I was a bit disappointed. On the other hand my wife seemed happy (it was a present for her) and didn't seem to notice where I removed the kinks."
5,Excellent,"The necklace was beautiful, and arrived quickly am very pleased with the jewlerly and the servicehoneybee"
5,Beautiful Piece,Just ordered this 3 days ago and I already have it around my neck. Shipping was very quick and the necklace itself is beautiful. Very good craftsmanship and comfortable. If you like silver I highly recommend this piece. I will definitely continue to order from Silver Insanity in the future.
5,five stars,"Arrived in Jerusalem about a week after ordering, more than a month before estimated delivery date. Bought for my 20 year old beautiful daughter, hesitatingly hoping to satisfy her very refined taste. She is very happy, in fact, excited, about the beauty and the great quality."
1,Cheap,"This looks like something you get out of a gum ball machine. We have been trying to return it since we got it, but seller is hard to reach.... The photo is misleading, and I discourage anyone from buying this.Jack"
1,Don't bother,"I have never been so offended by anything I have read before. This is absolute CRAP. I'm a cape verdean and I lived there for many years and none of the author's account rings true. This is a fraudulent attempted at writing about something that the author has no knowledge of. He is ignorant, hateful, and condensanding."
4,"Great book, could improve","The author is experienced in the subject matter and gives logical explanations of hows, beginning with the cylinder block and following up to the last step in the blue printing process - the balancing of the engine. I thought there could be a little more emphasis on the why's so someone knows exactly why he is advised to mess or not mess around with a part in a certain way. How about a chapter on safety? Higher resolution color photographs will also be a value addition instead of black and white images to aid in better discrimination of surfaces, parts and tools. Overall, a good book with room for improvement."
2,"A good overview, but more meat please!","This book gives a good overview on common tools and practices in blueprinting an engine but lacks fine detail. Certain machine practices the author just mentions and then states to have your machinist do this. Hello? I bought this book to do the stuff myself and save $$.I was hoping for a reference that would demonstrate how to cut valve seats and press in inserts and what tools are needed or maybe blueing and port matching your heads and intake (not just gasket matching).There was some good info offset grinding and welding but again I want more detail on the submerged arcwelder recommended and which electrode. Am I expecting too much?Hey, if anyone out there knows of a book that is along these lines let me know. I just don't want to spend $600 on the Sunnen manual but I really want to know the in and outs of everything on blueprinting and rebuilding an engine. Specific machining practices and setups, all specialty tools needed, etc."
3,Good principles,"This book has some very good principles on engine blueprinting (as the name suggests), but tends to be more Chevy/American engine oriented.With import performance these days (European and Japanese straight fours and staight sixes, twin cams, v-tec, and four/five valve heads), an updated version with broader scope is needed.Adequate photographs make the text easy to understand, and the witing is straightforward.If you are not a professional engine builder, at least you will know what to ask for next time you visit the machine shop."

5,Engine Blueprinting,"This is an excellent book, good explanation, stays on subject. Very practical - information you can actually use. Remember, its a book on blueprinting your engine, not building it. Measuring tools, balancing, cam degreeing, clearance and tolerance issues are well covered."
4,Works fine,"I think this keyboard is adequate, but noisy keys. I wish they were quieter. My daughter hates the blue color. Maybe they should make a black to match what HP offers."
2,Do not recommend...,"Both the mouse and the keyboard have some issues that make them not worth the pretty blue color. The mouse often moves on it's own when I'm not even touching it, or sometimes the pointer disappears completely and it takes a few seconds of shaking the mouse around to make it re-appear. Plus, when I play a particular video game my little character will be walking around when suddenly I'm spinning in rapid circles staring at the ceiling; I never had that problem with my old Dell mouse. The keyboard has some issues also. I can't quite pinpoint what the problem is, but when I'm typing up papers I am constantly hitting keys that I don't intend to hit--very frustrating. And again, I never had that problem on any other keyboard. I definitely recommend buying another product, despite the pretty color of this one."
4,Love it!,"I loved this story as a child, so I wanted a copy for my own children. I was lucky to find a board book format - and now my twin toddlers (2 years) love it too. It's an excellent little story for learning sequencing. It provides sentence structures a little different and more sophisticated than some other children's books. It also serves as a fun interactive discussion point, ""Do you think that tigers usually drink tea? Where do they live, in a house?"""
3,Interesting book but not much of a story,"This was recommended to me and is quite popular however, I just don't get it. The story is odd- about a tiger who shows up for tea and eats the family out of house and home. Then, they buy new food and go out for dinner. The tiger never returns.... it's just kind of an odd ending. My three year old isn't too impressed with this one- probably not one I'd say is a must for your library."
5,good book,This book did meet my needs. Thankyou so very much. it's appreciated. it's a fantastastic book to read and a lot of fun.
3,Interesting approach and collaboration but not exceptional,"I bought this out of general interest in Dylan cover compendiums having into double figures of such LPs and CDs in my collection. The interesting thing for me has always been how many artistes are better at interpreting the man's songs than himself and this selection has the added touch of songs by each participant as well as the Dylan contribution.While it was clearly an enjoyable event for the arranger of the event (per the CD liner notes) and the performers based on the two attached reviews by participants, I fear I did not find the overall quality of performance or interpretation that great across the whole CD compared with the other Dylan compilation bought at the same time from Amazon (""Dylan Uncovered"").One for mainly manic Dylan collectors I fear."
5,I LOVE my All Things Cedar 4' Swing,"If you enjoy being outside when the weather allows, outdoor wooden furniture is a must have! Most of the furniture I have had for the deck and yard has been plastic. I just don't like the look of plastic furniture and it is not made to last for long. I may be able to keep plastic furniture for a few years, but they don't last much longer than that. I was so thrilled to review a gorgeous cedar porch swing (retail $219.00) from All Things Cedar. I was given the 4' cedar porch swing to review. I have never had a porch swing, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The swing does not come assembled, so you will need to put it together. The instructions were very easy to follow and it took less than 30 minutes to put together. We have enjoyed our swing so much and we have only had it for a handful of days! I just wish I would have gotten one sooner! If you are interested in cedar furniture for yourself, All Things Cedar may be a good place to start."
1,Some scary stuff....,"Just a warning, some of the Grimm tales are pretty grim. The story of Big Klaus and Little Klaus, which I'd never heard before, features a man killing another man's horse, complete with (Eric Carle illustrated)picture of bloody ax and bleeding horse lying on the ground. It additionally features implied adultery and Little Klaus tricking Big Klaus into killing himself. Not too delightful if you ask me. My 3-year-old son liked some of the stories and pictures, especially the Aesop's fables. Just get that one unless you've actually read through these stories. The fairy tales of previous centuries are a bit rougher than what we're used to reading to our kids these days."
3,A good basic introduction to Lebesgue integration,"A good basic introduction to Lebesgue integration, but a little sketchy in some places. Each chapter concludes with a good set of exercises. This book is good for getting the ""idea"" behind Lebesgue integration, but comes up short on many of the details. An excellent companion volume would be Jones' ""Lebesgue Integration on Euclidean space""."
4,Power Pop the way God intended!,"This album by Australia's DM3 represents the best thing to happen to Power Pop in a long time. Produced mostly by Mitch Easter, this 1997 compilation of DM3's best tracks sounds like a cross between The Raspberries and The Records.Powerful harmony vocals and over-driven guitars decorate memorable tracks like ""Second Floor"" (a cross between Badfinger's ""No Matter What"" and Raspberries ""Go All The Way,"") and ""Show You."" Those two tracks alone are worth the price of the album, which comes loaded with 20 power pop gems."
3,DM3,"123 Devestated is one of the best songs in the past 20 years, unfortunaterly the rest of the disc doesn't live up to that song. Still better than 99% of the junk on radio."
5,Set of four Golden Retriever ambiance coasters,I really like thirsty stone because it keeps glassware from dripping on my tables. They are very absorbent and protect the tables and countertops.
5,Fascinating glimpse into late 18th C. American life.,"These original essay length letters composed by an intelligent and imaginative immigrant offer us a fascinating glimpse into life in early America. The letters chronicle his travels across the thirteen colonies in the years leading up to the revolution. With pathos and humour he gives us an intimate look at family life in the whaling ports of Nantucket and Marthas Vineyard. We visit with John Bertram, the celebrated botanist on his Pennsylvania farm. We are escorted through the middle colonies to Charelston for a first hand look at the opulent lifestyle of the planters. Our guide points out the absurdities he confronts while chronicling the beauty and diversity of the natural landscape. This book provides a wonderful and historic experience."
1,Bad experiences with Maxtor drives,"I just had a Maxtor 80GB drive fail that was 2 months old. 2 years ago I had a Maxtor 20GB drive fail after 9 months. I have never had a failure from a Western Digital drive. I have bought my last Maxtor ... if a new computer comes with one ... I will not buy it. Based on my experience so far, the failure rate of these drives in the first year is 67% (the replacement for the 20GB did not fail in the first year). Two out of three in this case is bad ... very bad."
2,Watch Out!!!,....I strongly recommend using and sticking with Western Digital hard drives. I've installed 10 of those with none of the problems that I encountered with this product.You have to figure out what the pictures in the documentation mean to set the jumpers as to master or slave settings. Those are well marked on Western Digital's hard drives. I never could get the software that came with the Maxtor or the computer to acknowledge the presence of the hard drive. Even changed the cables. I do not recommend this product at all and in the future plan on purchasing Western Digital no matter what the price. It might be a faster hard drive but that can't be proven by me!!!
4,Great Cook Boot!,This book is full of recipes that I can use everyday. Not only are they light recipes they taste great... they are soo good that my friend went out and bought the book as well.
5,Cooking Light Cookbook,"Transaction was streamlined and simple, and this is possibly the best recipe book I have ever bought!"
5,A collection of Cooking Light Magazine Recipes....,"If you want to indulge and cook up Stuffed Chicken Parmesan or Shrimp Scampi..you can without all the fat and calories.This new cookbook really should have a picture up, the cake on the cover and the lavender color in the background will invite you to open this book. What you will find is:1,000 recipesNutritional analyses and healthy makeovers of your favorite foodsStep-by-Step how-to photosTips and time-savers from Cooking Light editors528 pages of inspirationThis is a collection of the best recipes. They are also healthy and there are plenty of color photos so you can see how the recipes will turn out.~The Rebecca Review"
4,Just got the book,"I haven't tried any of the recipes yet, but I've looked through the book and they all sound good and easy to make. However, for a book that costs 35 bucks, I was a little disappointed to find that there were very few pictures of the recipes. Not that it takes away recipe quality, but I'm one of those cooks that likes to see what I'm about to create.I expected more pictures for a book that costs as much as it does."
3,Good resource but older edition.,"AT first glance, it appears to be a publication in the early 80s with little improvement for current low fat meals. Not as helpful as I would have thought,."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"I read a few of the reviews, and people claimed the photo's were great! Well, there weren't that many - so I don't see why they'd even mention the photo's. I'm the type of person who looks for cookbooks full of photo's, to see how the food should look by the end. Not only that, I just prefer to search for a recipe by the photo, rather the read each recipe. Anyway, the recipe's looked ok, but if you're like me, and like a cook book chock full of photo's and wonderful recipes, then this isn't the book for you."
1,Anti-Semitism and Bigotry on Parade,"From three self-serving, hate-filled demagogues comes the most Anti-Semitic drivel since Hitler's ""Mein Kampf."" This junk is not worth reading. This group should tour the country as ""The Three Bigots."" They would be a real hit at Nazi rallies. Avoid this pile of junk!"
3,A good book for new managers,"This book provided basic, down-to-earth advice in a readable format. As a veteran manager and decision-maker, I didn't find anything new here. But I have found the book particularly useful for coaching and mentoring."
1,The Worst Book Written about Decision Making Ever!,Evidently the author couldn't make a decision on his own thoughts ... 80% of the sentences of the text are cited from other sources. Not a single original idea from the author! This text was required reading for a Management Critical Thinking and Decision Making class. You can be sure I will contact the dean to remove this book off the list.
3,"Very slim, not a modeling resource","This book is very slim, even by Ospey standards - 47 pages of large font type somehow slipped between lots of pictures and tabels. But the pictures are mostly small and don't show a lot of detail for modelers. The color plates are paintings of four side views, one 3-view, one 3/4 external, and one 3/4 cutaway of Stug IIIs, and one 3-view of the Stug IV (with schurzen - not helpful!) and a corner view of a Sturmhaubitze. There are some schematic drawings, but they are at 1/76th scale which is not very useful because it is both very small, and of a not commonly used scale for modeling (1/72 would be good, 1/35 would be better). There is only a single paragraph on Stug IVs total.It is a decent overview of the vehicle, how it is used and its strengths and weaknesses. But it isn't really helpful for people making models or looking for more than just basic information."
2,shallow,In short.The book left quite a lot of blank spaces on the history of the vehicle. The lack of new photos is evident and the color plates are below the standard quality of Osprey...There is very little usefull information about the Sturmgeschutz IV.Dissapointing book.
5,Amazing Retro Sci-Fi art .............needs more art credits,I have to agree with the reviewers who said there are no credits on the great works of art in this book. They are some of the best I have seen to represent the genre. It gives me inspiration to start painting and drawing again in my favorite of all genres...sci fi. The only fault in this book is that it should have been longer and had more art reproductions of the covers. I loved every page of this. I can see some of the ships slightly resemble the U.S.S. Enterprise. Probably that's where Matt Jeffries got his inspiration. From these pulp covers there are images that can be retro fitted for today's sci fi movies.
1,Terrible,I ordered this product and it was nothing like the description on Amazon.com. It took forever to get to my house and when I emailed the company to ask if I could return it they never emailed me back.
2,Leather carrying case is no good,"I bought this set because it was [inexpensive]. U get what u pay for. The leather carying case does not fit the phone perfectly. I'm constantly moving it around so that it doesnt cover the keys on my phone. The case also doesn't have a clear plastic cover to protect the screen, which I think would be the most important part in geting a case. Why would you need a leather case for, if it doesnt have a clear plastic face cover? The clip for the case also isn't good. It allows the phone to fall off your belt easily, by pressing a button. If your going to be working, I wouldn't suggest it because it would let the phone fall easily. Right now I don't even use the clip anymore. The charger works, and that's the only reason this product is geting a 2 star rating. But I would highly suggest buying a different case."
4,Mice,"This older children's book has great photographs and great information on mice, whether for pets or just for general education."
3,2279 pages from this cartridge,"I purchased one of these cartridges in Nov, 2007 and it is now starting the give me white vertical streaks -- it is out of toner. I got 2279 pages from this cartridge. I had an HP brand Q2613A cartridge, rated for 2500 pages, before this cartridge and I got 2765 pages from the HP cartridge. Both cartridges are rated at 5% coverage and the type of printing we were doing is basically the same for both cartridges. So, it seems that the 3000 page rating on this cartridge is high. Given the real number of pages the cartridges are good for and market prices the HP cartridge is more economical for me."
5,Would never have predicted it,"I would never have predicted that this toy would still be around after almost 2 years. My youngest son received it for his third birthday and I'm now shopping for his 5th and noticed this toy. He and my older son (then 5, now 7) both love it. We've lost about half of it and they still play with it. The only thing I can figure is that it shoots its missiles really far (across the front hall and into the next room), which is pretty exciting. And of course your batman action figure can ""drive"" it. I don't understand the attraction, but I know my kids love it."
4,Batalicious!,"Very cool batmobile. Glad I read the reviews: when I first noticed ""scratches"" on the toy, I remembered that those are deliberate battle scars.Rushed to acquire a Batman Begins basic figure to fit in the cockpit. Bought the ""BATMAN BEGINS Basic Figures (Character=H1327:Exo Suit)"" figure, which mostly fits, but still gets his bat ears smushed a little when you close the cockpit door. :(Maybe other figures might not have that problem, but I'm not willing to pay today's going rate of $10-15 for a 5"" figure, so unless they reissue a line of Batman Begins figures, we'll have to make do with the one we have."
4,Great car for a tough little boy,"I recently gave this car as a birthday gift to a four year old boy in my home daycare. He loves it so much! It is very detailed and yet still very rugged. He has had two problems with it but an older child would have more patience. It's difficult getting his Batman to sit all the way down in the seat. And unless he's all the way down, the top won't close and has popped off (it looks difficult to pop off, but this kid has done it). It's easy for an adult to pop back on. The second issue has been getting the arrows that shoot out back into the guns. You have to rotate them until they pop in. These are pretty minor problems if you have a child with a little patience and the overall quality far outweighs these issues."
5,All kids love it,"If you're unsure of what to buy for a birthday present, this is it. I bought it for my 7 year old and every boy from age 4 and up love it. When we have play groups, all the kids want it."
5,Great product!,I've used this conditioner for years and recommend it to everyone. I have tried at least 20 other types of conditioners and this is the only one that gives volume to my hair.
2,Average reference,"I like the fact that the book has a hard cover. And with 800 patterns, a person should be able to find something they like. However, I found other books on patterns that I like much better (""It's Okay if You Sit on My Quilt"", ""Once More Around the Block"" and ""849 Traditional Patchwork Patterns) and I have never used this book for a reference (yet) because I like my other books better. And I'm not crazy about the choice of fabrics that are used; there isn't much definition in value. There are quite a few applique patterns."
3,Carrie Hall Blocks:Over 800 Historical Patterns from the College,"a good selection of old blocks, some of which are no longer made. It would be a better book if all of the blocks shown had the pattern for making it, along with directions for actually putting the blocks together. A beginner quilter could be easily confused or discouraged from trying the blocks because of this."
2,A colorful book with many misidentifications,"The color photographs of Australian sea anemones are thisbook's best feature. However, many species are misidentified,e.g. Corynactis australis on p. 89 is Oulactis muscosa, Oulactis muscosa on p. 92 is Corynactis parvula, Barthelomea annulata on p. 41 is Phymanthus crucifer, and all the names of stichodactyline anemones (e.g. pp. 28-33) have since been taxonomically revised by the work of Daphne Fautin Dunn."
4,"Comprehensive, needs more instruction","I happen to have Victor Hallman's class at the Wharton School, and we use this as the text. As a result, I have had the unfortunate task of committing to memory large portions of this book. In general, I find the book to be thoroughly comprehensive in describing financial products and planning techniques. Hallman and Rosenbloom are conservative, and they incorporate a sophisticated knowledge of both tax law and financial theory. This volume, however, is somewhat outdated in that it does not include the 2001 tax relief act that phases out the estate tax and lowers the highest federal income tax bracket. In addition, I think that the book lacks instruction. Specifically, there should be more hypothetical scenarios of individuals in certain financial scenarios and suggestions about what tools they can use to improve their situation. That would make it more accessible to the average reader instead of simply the professional planner."
