5,Great movie about Watergate,"This is a great movie about the Watergate incident. My husband loves this movie because it's a thinking movie and also because it's a true story. If you like history movies, especially about our own history, I recommend this movie. It's kind of fun to see these actors looking so young."
4,"Solid, if not great, paranoid thriller","The Bottom Line:All the President's Men does a lot of things right--it successfully captures the drudgery and lack of glamor in journalism and Pakula's assured direction heightens the paranoid feel of the story--but the movie functions so much on the every movement of Woodward and Bernstein that it really misses (or bypasses) the central mystique of Watergate: it's a solid thriller on the ground level, but it could have told the whole story and been much more.3/4"
3,Kinda disappointed,"So this was made way before my time,and I understand it was a big hit at the time because of how big watergate was and also how big the two lead actors were. Now I am an absolute watergate buff, love everything about it, especially the book of this movie. The book of this movie is what started it all as far as investigatory journalism goes and it also helped blow open watergate. With how much I absolutely loved the book, I was kind of disappointed by the movie. Just wasn't what I was expecting. To be fair though, I don't think anything would have lived up to my expectations after how great the book was. Final assessment...it's alright, but you should read the book if you want the best version of the story."
1,not what you think it is,"This stinks because I was sent this ad for this paper along with the information about my newly puchased easy share printer dock. Naturally I thought this paper was for that item. It isn't. Sooo, if you just bought a printer dock, don't buy this. As a matter of fact, you might find you cannot locate the paper you need here at all."
1,Beware! Not truly 4X6,"I don't know how Kodak makes this without clearly labelling their package 4 X 6.375 !! Because that's what the paper is! It is a bit longer than 6 inches! But 1) it doesn't say that anywhere on the package, 2) there is no perforation meaning you need to somehow cut this (a big hassle!). So if your printer needs the extra area, this may work for you. But with the new generation of borderless printers, this is a very misleading product."
1,Review,This bar was difficult to use. It is hard to get s straight-line since the cables do not hold it level. The seller was prompt in shipping. However would not buy again. The straightedges that clip to the side are better
4,Very good fabric softener,"I have been using the other Henkel products and I decided to try Vernel fabric softener. It seems to soften clothes and reduce static as well as my old favorite, Downey liquid. Two reasons I continue to buy this product is that is that you only need 1 tablespoon for synthetics or 2 tablespoons for a full load of cottons. The other reason is that my clothes come out lightly scented - not reeking of perfum.My only gripe is that Henkel only imports Blue Sky (my favorite,) Wild Rose and Peach & lemon Blossom scents. There are four other varieties available in Europe. (The other scents are Vernel Almond & Honey Blossom, Vernel White Tulip & Tender Mint and Vernel Orchid & Lotus Blossom.)I also wish this product came in larger size bottles in the US/Canada. Here, it's only imported in 750 ml bottles, but in Germany it also comes in 1.5 liter containers."
5,I love the smell.,"I loved this product as did my children. The smell is clean and refreshing.I prefer this to DOWNEY. Avoid if sensitive to stonger fragances, my hubby was not a fan of it."
5,Great fabric softener,"Gets my clothes lightly fragrant, fresh, softer, and without static. I only use a little bit not as much as recommended and it does a wonderful job along with Persil detergent. I love the product but I would love it even more if the price will be more reasonable."
4,"An excellent, though somewhat academic, intro to Patanjali",I read this book on a beach in southern France in the summer of 1984. It sparked many years of subsequent reading
1,"Bad Fake Stereo, Filled with Strange Noises","A lot of the tracks on this cd are fake stereo, in which a mono recording was electronically transformed into artificial stereo. The transformation was very poorly, amateurishly, done: it resulted in very noticeable noises which ruin the listening experience. The noises can resemble distortion, but include other sounds. I disliked hearing the normal, natural sounds being preceded by faint pre-echos of them.The result here is a cd with so many loud, odd noises in the tracks that one does not want to listen to the cd a second time.I do not like fake stereo at all, and always prefer to hear a track in its original mono; but there is good fake stereo, and bad fake stereo, and this is very bad fake stereo. This fake stereo is intolerable.This cd does contain a few rare Anne Shelton tracks. But of course they are rare because they are not quite as good as the more common tracks. Also, one always has the option of downloading individual mp3s of the rare tracks."
3,"Lots of rhymes, but not the mother goose I remember!","There are lots of rhymes in this book, but I wouldn't consider them all Mother Goose (the itsy bitsy spider, yankee doodle etc.) Also some of the rhymes don't seem quite right-- the end of ""Ring around the Rosies"" is ""hush, hush, hush, hush, we've all tumbled down"". Some of the differences hurt the rhythm of the rhymes, too. Maybe these are just regional variations, but it wasn't what I expected. The illustrations are nice, though."
4,Lovely pictures,"A beautifully illustrated childrens book for those who love Arnold Lobel. The nursery rhymes are rather an odd selection, though, and very nonsensical."
4,Very Good Read,This book was good. It helped me to further understand the sin of Sloth ( the noonday demon). The writier was well informed. I would recommend this book to someone.
4,great buy,this is a great buy for newgrass fans . and even if you arent . it was a great journey to go back to the start with them up to when they disband . i love theses guys ......
3,"Good, but flawed","The compositions on this albums are among his best - generally more distinct, creative and diverse than his 80's and 90's releases. Highlights are the two singles, ""Rocket Man"" and ""Honky Cat"" and the glorious ballad ""Mona Lisas and mad hatters"". The music is quite diverse, incl. the gospel-tinged ""Salvation"" and one song, ""Slave"", that reportedly was an attempt to write a song in the style of The Band. The problem is that some of the performances sound rather forced (also a problem om his earlier releases IMO). EJ tends to sing on the top of his voice, and the playing lacks the freedom and naturalness they managed on his masterpiece ""Goodbye yellow brick road"". Especially ""I think I'm gonna kill myself"" sounds terribly forced. With better performances I would have rated this 4 stars, as it is it's only worth 3."
5,Stand in awe of Elton in his prime,"On the CD cases of Elton John's remastered CDs, several of his albums from the early-mid 1970s(everything up to Rock of the Westies)are labeled ""The Classic Years."" This album certainly lives up to that billing.The album is solid all the way through. There are several standouts, however. ""Honky Cat"" is a solid opener and a fun, upbeat little number. ""I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself"" is an intriguing contradiction; relentlessly upbeat melody combined with rather depressing lyrics. ""Rocket Man"" needs no introduction. ""Salvation"" and ""Slave"" are both powerful songs with a message.In my opinion, this album, along with Madman Across the Water and Don't Shoot Me,I'm Only the Piano Player stand out as his best works. Yes, even better than Goodbye Yellow Brick Road."
4,ONE OF HIS BEST,"What a great record. Only a couple fillers on this one. Everyone knows Rocket Man, and Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters has gotten more popular with the younger crowd since ""Almost Famous"" came out (deservingly so, its arguably his best song ever). But there is so much more on this disc as well. Infectious choruses, grat lyrics and flawless playing make this one a keeper. If you buy one studio record other than the greatest hits packages, this would have to be the one. Great, great music."
4,Elton John - Turn Around And Say Good Morning To The Night,"By the time Elton release ""Honky Chateau"" in 1972 he and co songwriter Bernie Taupin had several albums under their belts and had become a cohesive team. This album would go straight to the top of the charts with its huge hit singles ""Honkey Cat"", ""Rocket Man"", and the AOR favorite ""Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters"". Elton tried a little bit of everything on this album and for the most part it all worked. This would also be the first album to feature the backing band of Olsen, Murray, and Johnstone who would stay with Elton off and on through the rest of his career. Violist Jon Luc Ponty also is on hand prior to the launching of his own instrumental solo career. This album is somewhat inconsistent and leaned towards a generally more commercial sound. Songs like ""Mellow"", ""I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself"", and ""Slave"" only half work, but overall this is a good Elton John record and his first of many to go to number one on the charts."
5,His Best!,"I've always been an Elton fan, but haven't liked all of his albums. This one's great! The songs are first-rate, Elton's voice is in fine form, and the recording is excellent. By itself, Jon Luc Ponty's electric fiddle solo on ""Mellow"" makes this an album worth owning."
5,One of Elton's best album covers...,"Ok, when is someone going to admit this is Elton shown at his best? 'Might as well be me, i guess. This shot is so attractive- very intense, introspective...and yes, mad sexy. Shameless adoration- this cover adorns my desktop right now. By the way, the music is great too. This album is a close runner-up to 'Captain Fantastic &...' for me. Rocket Man is stellar."
5,No revues yet?!?,"No one's reviewed this yet?Good Lord, this is only one of the best EJ albums ever, one of his fine 70's records.Get real folks. EJ may be ""a bit much"" these days, but back in the day he WAS popular music. He was redefining album sales figures, radio station play-lists, and our views like nobody's business.And I'm the first person to comment on this? Unbelievable!"
4,decent book,"This is a pretty good book, but not as good as I had hoped. Its more in line with those ""Time life"" style of books, part of an outdoor library. I had hoped for a speciality fishing book by someone who is a pike/musky specialist, but instead its more general in its subject matter. Don't get me wrong I am glad I picked this book up, but will keep looking at different options as well.For the price I paid its a great book."
4,Meh,I received the heat-sink/fan four days post-order. Installation was quick with the exception of the heat-sink clamp barely clearing a few capacitors on mobo (K7S41GX). Overall performance with IC7 temps average 35C to 39C with AMD Athlon XP 2600+ Barton. Fans are 2000RPM+ and are quiet. Overall great product for price.
5,Great book about Paris Museums!,"We own a copy of 'Little Known Museums in and Around Paris', and after over 18 years of visiting Paris and its many Great museums, we found that we still missed 12 out of the 30 museums listed in her book.Now we can't wait to go back and visit these 12 that Ms. Kaplan has so thoroughly and appealingly described, with the many magnificent photos and well researched text, this is a book to savour in an armchair, or to use to preview your next trip. We have already put 'The Fan Museum' and the 'Maurice Ravel Museum' on our 'MUST SEE', for our upcoming summer trip. Thank you for listening.Lana & Murray Singer (New York City)"
5,Better than Bottled Shampoo,I've used this product for a number of years - at home and on my travels through Europe. There's nothing better or more convenient. Give it a try.
2,Wouldn't use it everyday . .,"Ever since I saw the movie Carrie, and she washes the blood out of her hair with a bar of soap - I've always wanted to wash my hair with a bar of soap. Well, I did, with this bar of soap. And it's true, the first time you use it, it really does do something for your hair. Yes, your hair is squeaky clean, and as others mentioned, you may think you need to use conditioner - but don't - you don't need too. The second use, well. . . and the third - oh for the luv of - not so much. All soap is oil based, and changing from one type to another will make a difference the first couple of uses - then it stops working. This stopped working sooner than most - it made my hair flat and without any shine. Needless to say, the novelty of the bar wore off and I won't be buying any more."
3,great for kids,"as an adult, I would only use this once in while but my husband loved it. It also works great for kids hair too. Very gentle and no dertergents and I would probably buy it again."
1,Great idea but didn't work for me,"I gave this a star because it's so ECO FRIENDLY (reduces plastic shampoo bottles going into landfills!) and because of the GREAT PRICE ($1.76 /ounce).My hair is long, medium thick, dry & color-treated. Sadly, this shampoo left my hair DRY & TANGLED, yet my scalp OILY. I now use Lush solid shampoo ([...]) which is more pricey ($2.80-$6.30 / ounce) but still eco friendly and it works really well. If Liggett's formula is changed, I'd be willing to try it again."
3,Not a fan,"I like that your hair does feel extremely clean after you use it, but I do not like how long it takes to lather. It makes my hair washing process longer. Maybe a liquid formula of this same shampoo will better suit me."
3,"Nothing special, just a bar of soap","There is nothing special about this ""shampoo"" bar. It is a bar of plain old soap (oils, lye, and water), the kind you can make in your kitchen with a little knowledge and some standard chemical safety gear. It is extremely small, about 2 x 2.5 x 1 inches. If you don't like making your own soap (or if you're just too busy, like me), there are more economical bars out there. I usually buy an online brand that comes in a 6 oz bar (about 2.5 x 4 x 2 inches), for about 5 dollars.For those people who get a build up from washing their hair with natural soaps in hard water, a couple of table spoons of apple cider vinegar in a generous glass (16 ozs) of hot water makes an excellent rinse. Just don't get it in your eyes!Only three stars for this since it is so small for the price and claims to be more than what it is - a standard bar of soap."
3,"Left Some Sort Of ""Build-up"" On My Hair","I was so excited to get this. There are so many positive things about it: all natural, no plastic packaging, great for travel, etc., etc. It worked fine for a couple of weeks and then, like others have mentioned: it started to leave some sort of weird ""build-up"" on my hair. I didn't feel clean after using it anymore. The hair felt ""coated"" with something after it dried even though I had rinsed it very well. (I found it weird that it took a couple of weeks of using it about before I noticed a problem.) I have very hard well water but have a water softener, but maybe the softener doesn't work very well? I SO wanted to love this. I have went back to using my old ""natural"" liquid shampoo and my hair feels much cleaner with no ""build-up"". I will use the rest of the bar as a body wash. If I ever move somewhere where the water is really soft, I will try to use this product again."
5,Great Shampoo For Dry Hair,"If you have dry, brittle hair as a result of thyroid problems, you will find that this shampoo can work wonders for you. Regular shampoos always left my hair frizzy, fly away and very spongy right after washing. I have been using this shampoo for several months now, and the change in my hair is amazing. Coconut oil is one of only two oils that can actually penetrate the hair shaft(scientifically proven), sealing moisture in the hair from the inside, and protecting the hair from protein loss. My hair is stronger, shinier, and not breaking off anymore. I no longer need to use gel or hair spray to keep my hair in place. I will never use regular shampoo ever again!"
3,For travelling,"I bought this for a trip to India and planned to use it as shampoo, body soap and laundry soap. (I like to pack light!) It was a good idea and worked well for my body and clothes. However, I found that it left a film in my hair, even after I lathered up twice and rinsed VERY well. It made my hair look greasy.It's possible it had something to do with the water in India. I'd recommend trying this bar out at home before your trip to see how it works for you, and bringing backup shampoo just in case if you're planning to take it on a trip.On the plus side, it didn't have any sort of strong scent (a bonus if you don't want to attract bugs!), and it lathered up fine. The bar is small but would last for approximately 2-3 weeks if used for body and hair for one person."
2,Left my hair feeling gross,"I read a lot about using this kind of shampoo before I bought it, so I knew I'd have to use it for a while before I could really know how it worked. I really wanted to like it but it left my hair feeling gross and hard to manage; this didn't get better over time either, it always felt pretty much exactly the same."
2,Smells funky,"I haven't actually put the tights on yet but when I first took it out of the packaging, it smelled a little odd. I follow the principle that it's always good to wash clothing items before I wear them. I hand-washed these tights using some gentle handsoap. The first thing I noticed was that the nylon smells like vomit. I kid you not . I thought that this was only when it was wet, because some fabrics have an odd smell when they are wet, but even after I hang-dried these tights for 24 hours, they still smelled this way. Therefore, I am soaking them in laundry detergent and water right now, hoping that the smell will go away. I wouldn't purchase this again because I have a sensitive nose!"
2,"Great color, not sure about quality","The shipping was fast, I loved them when I saw them but I could only wear them about 3 times and they broke. I'm not sure about the quality of these panty hose but I have a pair from Victoria Secret and I have had them for over a year. I guess you get what you pay for..."
5,Made my wifes legs look AWESOME!!!,The title says it all. Ladies if you are interested in showing off your legs these will do the trick.
3,Love the silky look.,Only I ordered the wrong size & the tore on her trying to get the panty up higher. Also she didn't like the color of them she is use to Legs Shear Energy hose in sun tan this was the closest I could get to that.
1,Amazon screwup,"This would be a good CD is you ever get the right one from Amazon. Not being able to reach a human operator at Amazon, I have repeatedly tried to inform them via the ""returns page"" that their stock of this CD has a problem because althought the CD container/box says ""Greatest Hits Grieg"", the actual CD inside is ""Greatest Hits Claude Debussy"".I given up on Amazon. This is my last attempt at any purchase with this company."
1,Not the right recording!,I tried to buy this twice. Both times I got the Best of DeBussey and not Grieg. From 2 different sources. Sony screwed up!
4,Grieg's Hits,"I really like this CD, but my issue is with the shipping & handling cost, which I forgot to mention when I reviewed the camera case I bought. By the time I buy for a special rate, the shipping is almost as much as the product. So if I don't like it & wish to return it the cost is not worth a return."
2,Not great,"Sizing was fine, but they have a 'texture' to them which caused them to get pulls quickly and weren't very comfortable to wear."
3,Beware: watch will need adjustment after purchase,"This Fossil watch has a wide stainless steel band that is not easily adjustable. Unless you have unusually large arms, this watch will not fit you. Fossil includes neither instructions nor tools for adjusting the watch band. I had to take my watch to a watch repair store and pay $10 to have four links removed."
5,Doris Day - Personal Christmas Collection,The only disappointment is that there aren't more of these holiday gems!
3,2003 re-release of the Doris Day Christmas Album!!,"To all of you who are disappointed in this CD because some of the tracks from the 1964 release of The Doris Day Christmas Album are ""missing"", look no further. Apparently, in November of 2003, either Columbia (or Sony) has re-released the Christmas Album as a UK Import. Look it up on Amazon UK or Tower UK. It is called ""Doris Day Christmas Collection"" or ""Doris Day Christmas Album"" depending on which website you find it on. From what I can tell (I have not heard the CD yet), it has all 9 tracks from the original 1964 release, plus several more ""bonus"" tracks. I will order it right away. Even paying for the international air mail from the UK is worth having those tracks. At least now, true Doris fans won't have to pay a ""super rare out of print"" price on what has become one of Doris's BEST albums. Doris has always been one of the 20th Century's most underrated singers."
1,Huge dissapointment,I bought this as a gift for my niece. We opened it immediately to give it a try and it simply did not work well. The bubbles either didn't come out or came out very slowly. It's also very messy. It seems strange to just throw away a brand new toy but I expect that the X-Stream Links is headed that way.
1,"does,t work at all!!!",I got it for my 3 yo son and we can not even make it to work at all. such a waist of money but most of all see the disapontment on the face of the little one. shame on them.
3,needed elmers wood glue,"Looking at this products picture you can kind of tell its not the most solid piece, I wouldn't sit on it. When it arrived in the mail I had to glue a rod back into its hole. A very minor repair. It goes with my daughters nursery theme it was worth it. I don't regret the purchase I the way it looks in her room."
3,Challenges the dominant caricature with solid journalism,"Hizb'llah: Politics and Religion by Amal Saad-Ghorayeb explores the ideology of Hezbollah and the tension between its Shia theology and the practical demands of operating in the Lebanese political scene. Also, despite its unfortunate title, Hala Jaber's Hezbollah: Born with a Vengeance is a good journalistic account of the party from its roots in the 1970s until 1996. Online, the Middle East Research and Information Project has produced a good primer on Hezbollah by Lara Deeb or for a summary of the history of Lebanon and U.S. intervention, see Stephen Zunes' ""The United States and Lebanon: A Meddlesome History."""
2,Different than I Expected,"I've purchased other stamps from the same manufacturer at Office Depot. The other stamps have these guards on the bottom which automatically move out of the way as you press down on the stamp. This makes for easy stamping and easy storage. Although I expected this stamp to be the same, it was not. Instead, this stamp has a guard which must be manually flipped to the side each time you want to use the stamp and manually flipped back when your stamping is completed. Maybe I didn't do a thorough enough job reading about the product to determine this but either way, I'm not 100% satisfied."
5,too expensive,used to order 2 boxes of 25 for $21.00-n0w it is over $35.00 for 2 less k-cups. going elsewhere.
2,Same same,"Even though the K-cups are marked as ""variety"", they all pretty much taste the same. It's weird. I get a nutty flavor from each cup. I'm not fond of this coffee. I enjoy Green Mountain."
3,Gloria Jean WEAK,Loved the aromas but wish they were bolder even when I used the smallest cup setting I found the coffee blah though it is supposed to be medium it was tasteless!
4,flavored coffee,"love the K-cups...some of the flavors in the variety pack were not to my taste, but over all the coffee is good. I like to have some different flavors for guests. this is a nice sampling. The cappuccino is my favorite."
2,Mix-up in packaging?,The major problem I had with this product was that the french vanilla supreme and the butter toffee seemed to be the same (not to mention disgusting). I think there must have been a mix up in packaging because those flavors should not taste anything alike. The other flavors were very good. I would buy this again if it wasn't for all the butter toffee k-cups sitting around in my kitchen.
2,"Uh, no","If you like flavored coffees, this one is probably okay. The folks I work with and I don't care for most of the flavors and will not purchase this again."
1,Tastes like vomit,This is the most disgusting coffee I have ever tasted. I tried the Butter Toffee flavor first because everyone on here was raving about it. I should have known by the smell when I was brewing it but I was brave. I almost threw up in my mouth. It tasted just like vomit. Then I tried the Hazelnut and it was ok (barely) but I think the vomit flavor is stuck in my machine now. I gave the rest to a friend for their office. Stay away unless you're a fan of regurgitation.
2,VERY VERY BLAND COFFEE,"I tried this product, because it came as part of a sample pack with my Keurig Coffee maker........Tastes like dish water, try the Newmans coffeemuch much better, or of course the green mountain K-Cups are excellent as well"
5,Gloria Jean's French Vanilla coffee,We love Gloria Jean's French Vanilla it is far better than any we have tried...so far three different kinds...I will continue to order it ...it is not artificial tasting yet it is very nicely flavored..If you like Vanilla coffee? Try it....
3,GLORIA JEAN'S COFFEE VARIETY PACK,PERSONALLY I DON'T CARE FOR THIS VARIETY PACK. I LIKE MY COFFEE STRONGER. AND TO ME THE FLAVORS KINDA ALL TASTE THE SAME. BUT FOR THE REST OF THE FAMILY THEY LOVE THEM ALL. SO THAT IS THE MAIN THING. I JUST GET ME A DIFFERENT KIND (GREEN MOUNTAIN EXTRA BOLD). I HAVE THE VARIETY FOR MY FAMILY AND VISITORS AND THEY LOVE IT. JUST KNOW IF YOU LIKE STRONG COFFEE THIS IS NOT FOR YOU.
4,"Great cup, odd mix","GJ coffee never disappoints. This variety pack is no exception. However, it was heavy on the French Vanilla and the numbers of the other flavors suffered. I was hoping for a more even mix."
4,Great flavored coffee,I love having a choice every morning and able to try new flavors without buying a whole pack of one flavor. You get 5 of each and the butter toffee is excellent. Great price also!!
4,Delicious..but which one?,"So I don't know if I'm blind but only a couple of the coffees have the actually flavor on them and the rest just say COFFEE. Don't get me wrong I like them all, I drink coffee quite a few times a day so this stuff is WONDERFUL to me :)"
3,Flavored Variety Pak Not One to Repeat,"A good opportunity to sample 5 different flavors, but only liked one well enough to consider ordering - Butter Toffee. Will keep the others on hand for the variety to offer to houseguests, but wouldn't purchase again."
3,Too weak,"I love flavored coffees, but I find most of Gloria Jean's flavored coffees too weak. I end up combining them with a really bold coffee like Coffee People's Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast. Turns out to be a pretty good cup of coffee when I do this."
3,Gloria Jeans flavored K Cups for Keurig brewers,I was a little dissappointed in the taste but perhaps it was because I was used to a ready made mix where I had to add nothing. I found that my order came quickly without problems.
2,too weak,"The flavor of the coffee overall was good, however each cup only made a small cup of acceptable strtength coffee, and if you own the newer machines with more than two selections for size this coffee will be weak with all but the smallest cup setting. net wt is 7+oz, I've seen brands that make a more acceptable strength cup weigh in @ 9oz and up. if you're stuck on Gloria Jean coffee, better use 2 k-cups per cup of coffee"
4,Coffee Variety pack,"This is a nice selection of flavored coffee K-cups. I like to have a variety off coffees to suit my mood or that of my guests and this help fill that need. The coffee is a medium brew, and I am happy with it."
5,Yum,"Gloria Jean's Coffees Flavored Coffee Variety, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)All I can say about this product is YUM....."
4,A Fun CD,"The music that is featured on this CD represents the heart of Debussy's writings. The fun and adventurous sounds won't soon be forgetten. It would be difficult to pick a favorite piece off of this CD. The broad range of emotions on this CD includes the joyous tunes of ""Golliwogg's Cake-Walk"" to the mystical harmonies of ""Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun."" It's a very exciting CD to add to your classical music library."
5,"""Mad World"" - Best Sad Song of the year","The main reason to buy this CD is for Gary's melancholy remake of the old Tears For Fears song ""Mad World"". Easily the best Sad Song of this year, maybe of the decade. A couple of years ago this track found a home on the now cult classic film ""Donnie Darko"".The rest of the album is surprisingly strong; very ""singer-songwriter"" sounding in a timeless way that would have fit just as comfortably in a 1970's landscape."
5,Something else,"I bought this because, like everyone else, I adored the cover of ""Mad World"" that Gary Jules did on the Donnie Darko soundtrack. I was surprised at how mellow the album is--I hadn't expected it to be quite so folky, I guess. I loved it instantly though. Even though I despise it when people try to describe an artist by comparing them to other artists, I definitely get a Cat Stevens/Peter Himmelman vibe from this cd. Any of the songs on ""Trading Snakeoil for Wolftickets"" would fit right in on the Rushmore movie soundtrack as well, which is a huge compliment as that soundtrack is absolute brilliance.Although the music is mellow, it's not boring or overly melancholy. It's Sunday-morning-sipping-tea-and-reflecting-on-your-life music. Memorable and important."
2,Most Boring Disappointment-HORRIBLE QUALITY!,"Except for the Mad World track, this album is about as exciting as dry cement. Sounds like an album made quick as filler for Mad World.Now let's closely listen to Mad World; It sounds like it was recorded on a digital 8 bit bounce-a-matic. It might work for punk but it is very grating on a good system when the music is soft and the resolution is cheese grating MP3 quality (or less). You are not fooling me, Mad World was either recorded on inferior equipment or ruined in mixing. Too bad, it's a wonderful song, but not on this CD! If you like one hit wonders with the hit screeching digital noise, then purchase it now; if not skip this one. Too bad guys! Some of us CAN hear what's going on. Some of us listen on more than ear buds. Give us all the resolution you can, or sell it only on ITunes!"
2,Pretty weak songwriter...Great with covers though,"There is only one decent song on this album. The same one that will hook 90% of us that buy this CD. After a couple of listens to the rest of the disc all I can say is that Mr. Jules has a great ear for interpretating others work, but he will soon be stuck on the coffee house circuit once again."
2,not worth it,"I found it a disappointment. None of the songs are worth listening to more than once (i.e., anything special) except the cover of Tears for Fears' ""Mad World,"" seemingly thrown in there amongst all the rest to break its boredom. The other songs are not insightful or to my liking. It's definitely not a CD worth buying (and I'm glad I didn't)."
4,Mad World,"I bought this CD because of his rendition of Mad World. What a great cover song! Track 13 (the Untitled Track) is also very very good. The more I listen to it the more I like it. It's actually stuck in my head RIGHT NOW. Be advised that if you want to listen to this song you have to deal with a long pause before it comes on. I just fast forward the CD until the song starts. As far as the rest of the CD is concerned it's very relaxing and I can definitely close my eyes and hear some Simon & Garfunkel influences in his music. I have an appreciation for his song writing abilities. And I think anyone with a deep appreciation for ""real music"" and songwriting would appreciate this CD."
1,Awful product,"I find the adhesive on these pads are so strong that I could never remove the pads in one piece. And after removing the pieces, the tape residue remain on the fabric of clothing. This product actually ruined many of my expensive jackets. Frustrating... I dont like this product at all."
2,Save your money,"While these items are a good price and nice size, the adhesive is totally inadequate. I understand that they are disposable and not meant to be worn more than once, but the adhesive should keep them secured for at least one wearing. I found that they became separated from the sleeve after only a few hours, and I am not at all a heavy perspirer (perspirator?)."
3,book,good cover of book. good content of book like the cover of the book not enough pages in the book
5,WONDERFUL WONDERFUL WONDERFUL,THIS CD IS WONDERFUL VERY VERY NICE I ENJOYED THE WHOLE ALBUM I ALSO ENJOYED THE ARTIST THAT HE HAD WITH HIM ON SONG 5 CALLING TO ME THE ARTIST IS LIZ WITHERS SHES GREAT WITH WALTER. OKAY WALTER WE ARE WAITING FOR YOUR NEXT ONE. WE HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN SOON KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.. FROM KLP IN BOSTON
3,Definitely for kittens,"I tried to use it on my 6-year-old and he wanted no part of it. I should've started him at an earlier age. All in all, I'd still recommend it."
3,Tall?,"Nice Chair, comfortable. But I needed a ""Tall"" chair. It is only slightly taller than a normal chair. The actual seat height is not mentioned. If you are looking for a ""Tall Director's"" chair this is not the one you want. If you are looking for a comfortable, larger chair, then you may like this one."
4,SJK Big and almost tall,"Love the chair, but it's not quite as tall as a typical director's chair, which is what I was hoping for. It would be fabulous if they made one of this design and comfort with the added height!"
3,Solid but flawed,Love the size and height of the chair. I use it during art shows and it elevates me to the correct height. It's lightweight and easy to transport too. The only problem is that after some use the back rest starts tearing away from the vertical metal support...and there's no replacement backrest!
4,GO LUNA!!,The Wondrous Ms Luna Pearl Woolf...............what can I say? This woman is amazing - her writing is wonderful. Why on earth isn't she more famous already???
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,25 bucks for 48 pages? that's over 50 cents a page.The author is making a killing off anyone gullible enough to buy it.
5,black cabbie hat,"i like this hat, though i would advise those with larger heads to beware, as it is slightly small. very warm and stylish."
2,The visor doesn't last,"For me the visor broke fairly soon, thus making it not worth a repeat purchase. I think the visor is the weakness of the product - it's a flimsy piece of fairly brittle plastic. For hats, I need something I can put in my pocket and it doesn't break, my kids can sit on it and it doesn't break etc."
2,cheap hat,I love this hat and I am lucky enough to learn how to sew yard with thread! It must be a second because I am constantly sewing a hole here and there. Warm though and has a visor.
1,Too small,I was very disappointed with this item. I wanted to wear it to football games this fall. I don't think it will even fit my eight year old.
5,"Great Value, Thicker than I thought.!!",I am glad I bought this hat! because it feels great in my head.. great for cold mornings and great for hot days.Originaly bought it to hold my hair but it was also a great head warmer.I would recommend to any person concern of their hair being messed up by winds. My hair is soft so the wind would do that.it combines well with the jacket I bought from amazon as well.
1,Taken by surprise!,"I was really happy when I received this item in the mail and I was impatient to wear it however when I was opening it up. I found attached to the visor, a sticker that said, ""This product contains lead, a chemical known to the state of California to cause cancer, birth detects and other reproductive harm."" -________________-"
4,Pretty decent hat,This hat is definately worth the money (only a penny!) but it ripped the first day i got it when i tried to stretch it out because its a little tight. so i guess thats my fault but still. Besides that its a pretty good product!
1,Total piece of garbage,"This hat may appear to be a decent hat for the money, but it is made poorly. I'd write more about it, but I don't want to waste my time on such a useless article of clothing."
4,A very good book,A very thoroughly and thoughtfully researched chronicle of the life of an iconoclast. Story is a unique person even among his peers. Anne Lenehan captured far more than the typical celebrity biography!
2,book - Story NASA,"The book came with the cover on upside down. The text on the pages was upside down from the bound cover with a color photo front cover. It was a gift, my husband didn't think it was cute. I was amused. He wanted me to send it back. So, I did."
2,Long and boring,"This was one of the most boring movies that I've ever seen. It's one and only redeeming quality, other than it's photography, is the performance of Juliette Binoche. She is absolutely wonderful in this film and much deserving of the Oscar that she received for it. Her romance with the bomb squad man is the one and only interesting part of the movie. One of the worst choices that the Academy has made for Best Picture."
1,Couldn't watch the whole thing,"The best parts of this film were the minute-long landscape shots, free of dialog and narrative. At those points you could almost forget the absolute dullness of every character and plot aspect.Contrary to the gushing of the majority, this is not even a love story so much as it is a celebration of selfishness and treating others poorly. Don't let the WWII period piece propaganda fool you on this. Granted, I turned it off after 1.5 hours out of sheer dread and boredom, so maybe this flaming sack of doo redeemed itself in the last hour."
1,Horribly boring! Over-rated! Too long ZzzzzzzzZZZZzzzzzz,"The English Patient was said to be one of the best movies ever. I see alot of people would disagree and many would agree but I thought that this movie was just horrible. It just went on and had NO POINT. There was no point. It was just soooo long. It was not captivating and the acting was good but not great. It was a typical -The main characters name- movie. He always, for some reason stars in movies having to do with EUROPEAN HISTORY(WORLD WAR 1 and 2) binded with a EUROPEAN STYLE LOVE AFFAIR, expressed musicaly with what I call THAT MUSIC THAT SCREAMS OUT *THIS MOVIE HAS TO WIN AN OSCAR*. That's my opinion. Thanks for reading."
1,Awful Boring Movie,"This film stands out as one of the worst movies I ever sat through. It was painful! I didn't think it would ever end. If you havn't seen this movie, rent it before you invest any money in owning it."
1,"Miserable, Pure trash","Yeah, everybody loves this movie. Right. The Critics love it, but everyone I've talked to seems to hate it. Gee, I wonder why? Could it be that the acting is cardboard, the two main characters are repulsive, and that the story is so slow it makes James A. Mechner's Alaska seem like a Saturday morning cartoon? This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Fiennes acts like he is constantly constipated, and none of the main characters other than Juliette Binoche are actually likable. This movie is insipid, dull, and overall a huge waste of your time. Take some advice from me, and avoid this movie. You'll thank me later"
2,Borefest not much here don't waste your time,"Movie started out great, got me excited, the first 30 minutes was good. Then all of the sudden, boring and trite plot and subplot making me want to walk out of the movie all together."
2,Tedious and Cliched,"I bought the video based upon the non-stop praise the movie received from all of the critics, but didn't have the time to watch it straight through, so I watched it an hour a day. Somebody told me that if I liked the beginning then I would like the rest of the movie. I did like the beginning, but then the rest of the movie happened and like so many other popular movies like Top Gun, Backdraft, Dante's Peak and Deep Impact, the story became completely and utterly predictable, just with a slower pace and more literary refernces tossed in to make it seem intelligent. It isn't anywhere as good as Lawrence of Arabia, Casablanca or Howard's End, and it certainly didn't deserve the Best Picture Award. Fargo was robbed."
1,Awful,So Boring Well made but SO BORING i only Liked The Nurse It Was so bad I turned it off in the middle of it my parents fell asleep during it
2,"Good Package, Bad Story","First off, I must say, this movie does look tremendously pretty - very well done, excellent cinematography, and the like.However, when I watch a movie, I think the story being told is much more important than the way it is told. The English Patient, in my humble opinion, is a boring story. The drama is overdone, the film drags on and on, and by the time I watched the first hour, I had put the pieces together and knew exactly how the film would end. The only redeeming aspect of the film, I felt, was the curious and cute relationship that developed between the nurse and ""Kip.""Honestly, I can't believe that this film garnered so much critical praise - I've read reviews that said the Pianist seemed to drag a bit. If the Pianist dragged, then the English Patient skids and thuds at a slower pace, tearing bits of the ground off as it nearly refuses to progress.Eye candy it might be, but a waste of time the English Patient certainly is."
3,I wish I could love it,"Let's not even get into the ""Fargo"" vs ""English Patient"" arguement. Yeah this movie has flaws...lots of them in fact, but at least it's trying! While Fargo was a thoroughly nauseating bore, the English Patient was merely an under-realized story with lots of lush cinematography,and some technically masterful direction. I am a big fan of Minghella! He is one of the few directors out there that genuinely tries to hit one out of the park each time at bat. As with all directors however; he could not overcome the essential thinness of his material . In the end there is too large a discrepancy between what the movie should have been and what it is. P.T. Anderson ""almost"" sold me on the plight of his miserable characters in Magnolia (despite also having a weak narrative); a feat Minghella ultimately could not pull off with the ""English Patient""."
2,falls short of what it could have been,"Ralph Fiennes is one of my favorite actors. Juliette Binoche is one of my favorite actresses. I really enjoyed Ondaatje's novel. Why then, is this movie so dull? Perhaps it suffers from trying to stick too closely to the half of the novel it tries to depict. Perhaps there is just a lack of chemistry between the actors (Defoe in particular lacks a necessary dangerousness). I don't know. I just know that I do not care for this movie. I suggest that you read the novel instead. Don't write off Ondaatje's work just because of this lifeless (though critically acclaimed) motion picture."
1,Snore,"What a snore fest this movie was! I watched this with my sister-in-law and she was transfixed. This movie went on and on with these dream sequences (or memories?) that made no sense. After an hour and half of these unrelated boring sequences (with WWII in the background) I couldn't take it anymore and had to leave. Even the music couldn't make up for it. I personally hated this movie but my sister-in-law loved it. She watches soap operas and Oprah, so maybe she posesses a sensitivity and understanding of something in the movie I didn't get."
1,Not One Star! Negative Five Stars!,"That's right. Negative five stars. Why? Number one: The acting. I did not like it. In fact, you could call the acting bland. Number two: The ACTOR. Ralph Fiennes is pronounced ""Rife Fines""? Come on! He is merely trying to cover up a common pauper's name, pronounced as it is spelled, ""Ralf Feens"". This guy made Red Dragon almost unbearable. In fact, you could even say that Mr. Feinnes is the cause for all evil in the world. That is all I have to say for this overrated piece..., which shll be known forever as The English Patient. Case closed."
2,"Good-looking, but dull and trite","I went to see this film with hardly any expectations, except that the film was an Academy Award winner, therefore there must be at least some merit to it. I quickly found out that the film's true merit lay in the cinematography. The story was fairly predictable and I found nothing to like in any of the characters. I soon grew bored with the movie, but unfortunately, it lasts for two hours and forty minutes. (I mean, Lawrence of Arabia--a movie The English Patient so desperately wants to be--lasts for four-plus hours, and comparitively, the time flew while I watched it.) Viewing this film in the theater caused me to coin a new term: English Patient Syndrome. The simple definition is the condition which occurs when, while watching a dull motion picture, one believes his/her watch's batteries are running low, because it couldn't have *only* been five minutes ago that he/she checked it."
4,The English Patient Blu-ray,I like this movie. Winning 9 academy award .. transfer picture very good and audio DTS HD 5.1 very well. A lot of Feature in standart Definition. and i hope the English Patient NOT release agaian with different Feature in High Definition . And I didn't have a slipcase with this edition
2,Brains in revolt,"Quite inadvertently, this film depicts the roots of the struggle between those bipeds who think with their spinal cords and those who think with their gastrointestinal nervous systems. Kip is a belly-thinking product of Eastern philosophy while the Hungarian count is dominated by the European impulse to think linearly up and down the spinal column. Had this movie been made forty-nine years ago by Douglas Sirk, with Robert Stack as the English patient, Greer Garson as the adulterous hussy in the desert, Leslie Caron as the French Canadian nurse, Sabu as Kip, and Dan Duryea as Caravaggio, it would molder forgotten on the video store shelves, but the desire for those who still think with their spines yet assume they have achieved belly-wisdom to have an opportunity to display their taste and sensitivity to their dates have made this pretentious farrago a modern classic."
2,"Great Movie, Terrible Copy. Don't Bother","I have always liked this movie. I bought it on Bluray in part because it is beautifully photographed. The print however is terrible. You would think that they could have run down a reasonable copy and perhaps even cleaned off the link off before digitizing it, but apparently not. Lots of white spots and random black crap on the print. The disc does not support 24 fps playback and doesn't even have a top menu. Save your money and stick with the DVD until someone can be bothered to make a reasonable transfer."
5,Absolutely stunning,"Amazing acting, story, scenes, music and dialogue. The movie deserved all the awards it received and more. I found rating this movie reflects one's maturity."
2,Yawn...,"This is bad on so many levels it's hard to know where to start. I think the most fundamental problem is that you don't feel any empathy to the main characters so you don't really care about what they're doing. This makes the movie seem like it's dragging on forever, whereas it's only 2 3/4 hours. (Ok, so it does drag on forever). I'm a lover of drama and am sick of the current movie trend of eye candy at the expense of plot, characterization, etc., but there are so many better movies out there that I wouldn't even rent this one unless you just need a way to waste 3 hours."
2,I honsetly don't understand the critical acclaim,"The score is amazing, the best part of the movie, which is overlong and cliched. The last twenty minutes, which are wonderful, are the only reward given for sitting through three hours of mostly happily-ever-after trite. The physical love between the main characters, shown through flashbacks, is overdone and becomes tiring and gratuitous. It was rather shallow, and I certainly don't understand the academy awards bestowed upon it."
5,DON'T LISTEN TO THEM LISTEN TO ME!,"Two Sentences: This is unduobtedly best movie of all time! And Winner of 9 academy awards including: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress: (Juliette Binoche)and, Best director: (Anthoney Minghella). And I guarentee you that this movie will keep you awake, excited and make you want to read the wonderful novel by Michael Odaantje"
5,The English Patient,"Set principally in North Africa before, during and at the end of World War 2, men and women experience warmth, despair, passion, horror and a sense of frustrated destiny. A beautiful, gripping tale which reveals how all men and women battle with life's challenges."
4,Great but not endearing.,"Often cited as one of the 100 best films of all time, this film will provoke varying responses. Direction, sound, music, photography, dressing, and script have been justly praised and lavishly awarded. The cast looks good and they speak beautifully. Throughout its 160 minutes, I felt I was in the presence of greatness, but the film did not endear itself to me."
3,"The movie's great, the DVD is not...","I loved this movie and was really excited about getting the DVD. The sound is great, and I was still satisfied even thought there are absolutely no special features and the transfer is non-anamorphic. However, there's something screwy with the layer transfer, so I can only watch up to minute 85:00, and after Chapter 17. I don't know if this is widespread with Miramax, but I will think twice before I buy from them again."
2,What Time Is It?,"I kept looking at my watch. I kept thinking, ""this seems like a good time for the movie to end."" But it didn't. Like the Energizer Bunny, it kept on and on. I tried to like it, really I did, but I found it to be pretentious fluff, lengthy at that. It simply took too long to get to whatever was supposed to be the point. As I left the theatre, I just knew the critics were going to love it."
1,"Absolutly did not, deserve the best picture award.","The cinephotography was good, but thats it. This movie was horrable, could you people please explain to whats so enjoyable about watching a man that was burned beyond recognition slurp canned milk trough a straw while thinking about his depressing past. The best part of this piece of cinegraphic crap, was the 3 second scene of the guy trying to hit him with the airplane. If you want to see the best drama ever created, watch Braveheart."
2,I don't like it or maybe I just don't Get it.,"No, I think I just don't like it. It's very boring to look at in an expensively shot way. I liked Kristin Scott Thomas and like Juliette Binoche but watching this movie was similar to watching Titanic and Wedding Banquet - disbelief at the hype and total boredom."
1,Terrible!,"This is the worst movie ever to be filmed! I can't believe it won as many oscars as it did! It is stupid, long, boring, and not worth it. I wish I could give it zero stars."
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKED,THIS HAD TO BE THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. iT WAS UNBAREBLY SLOW AND BORING AND HAD NO REAL SUSPENSE SO IN SIMPLER TERMS IT SUCKED.
2,Overrated,"The English Patient is a vastly over-rated movie, filled with unmemorable characters and a slow, plodding story that builds nowhere. The problem is, the academy showered this film with oscars, as they often do with technically excellent, but substantively lacking films. Don't be fooled...The English Patient is simply not a very interesting movie."
1,"Is there a Doctor in the house? No, make it a lawyer!","This movie should be sued for malpractice. This is a story about liars and cheaters and it is hailed as a great love story. Excuse me, but what does love have to do with this story? NOT A THING! NOTHING!!! NADA!! ZIP!! ZERO!!! I seriously think this is a story people LIKE TO think they HAVE to LOVE. What a very sad commentary on our contemporary socieity when Elaine (a fictional character) has more sense than ""real"" (pretentious!) people!"
1,Patience Is Needed,"Let's begin with a little math: Artsy direction plus pointless story equals Oscars! Not too bad, but really I don't see all the fuss about ""The English Patient."" I've studied the book, watched the movie several times, and still don't see what's so great about it. Yes, it's pretty...even the burned German spy (now called English) doesn't look like a burned victim in ICU like he should look. Yes, there's a love story. There's WWII for all those WWII junkies. With all of this the movie is still boring, too long, and completely convoluted. It may be artsy, but art is subjective. I'd leave this one in the store and see other Oscar nominated movies from the same year such as ""Shine."""
1,?????????,"If anyone has ever seen that episode of 'Seinfeld' where Elaine went to see the English Patient, that is how I felt about this worthlessly dull film. The entire time I was watching it, it was like, ""Shut up about the plane and die already!"" I mean, if a movie is going to be this long, it should at least be interesting, but it's like watching some long, melo-dramatic soap opera where it will NEVER end. I can't believe THIS won 'Best Picture.' 1996 must have been a bad year for movies, cause my college film slides that we gotta take notes over are more interesting than this. My advice: Waste your three hrs. doing something else. If your totally set on drama, watch 'Saving Private Ryan' or 'The Crying Game.' Now those are good movies!"
1,"Perhaps the most beautiful, boring movie ever made !","I loved Out of Africa, So I really enjoyed Kristen Scott-Thomas's clothes. The Cinnematography was gorgeously presented. It was quite captivating! So, if these things REALLY appeal to you, I mean, REALLY, REALLY appeal to you, then don't miss this movie!"
2,Nihilist Elite,"This movie reminds me of the ""Ciderhouse Rules"", in that it is a vehicle for the Contempory wisdom of our time, the unsanctity of life (abortion, and mercy killing). The end of the movie features euthanasia; and defends the mercy killing with the rationale of the entire previous juxtaposed amoral plot. ...Ralph Fiennes charactor is the anti-hero, binal, and unredeemed - he struggles not for any good but his own pleasure in the present. One wonders if the author of the novel was tring to take the double strandard of Occidental morality and throw it in the West's cultural face? I got this movie by accident at the Video store. I was all set to get ""The Bridge on the River Kui"". Instead, I got The English Patient, as liking Ralph Fiennes in ""A Dangerous Man"". I should have stayed with the David Lean film. At least it had moral fiber..."
1,Anybody out there?,"Winner of 9 Academy awards, and it's not hard to see why: a luminous script, vibrant on-location shooting, assured direction, and stomach-churning performances.But the whole thing's about adultery!Hello? Anybody out there? Am I the only one left on planet earth who . . .Oh, what's the point?"
2,"Ditto ""organannie"" from Ontario (above)","Lovely to look at, interesting subplots, but the main story is GARBAGE"
1,I remember the English Patient as an incredibly boring movie,"Independence Day was a much better movie than the English Patient. It should have won Best Picture. There were also several other movies that were more entertaining like Fargo, Star Trek: First Contact, Jerry Maguire, and Eraser."
1,Unbearably bad movie,"If you are a Seinfeld fan you may recall that Elaine preferred to be fired rather than watch this wretched movie. I fully understand Elaine's choice. It is not simply that this movie is slow, it is that it is bad and slow, a combination that eats at your very soul. I made it to the 55 minute mark and am still amazed that I was able to accomplish that. A large part of the problem here is that none of the characters you meet are to any degree likable. Nor are they interesting.With many movies I do not enjoy, I can nonetheless ascertain why people enjoy them. I can even understand why people like Titanic, but I have no idea why anyone likes this movie."
1,Incredibly BORING AND SLOW!,"I HATED this film. To quote a reviewer who actually liked it:""Through flashbacks, the filmmakers slowly unravel the secrets of the burned man: who he is and his past.""The operative word here is SLOWLY. To make matters worse, it wasn't even a love story. Since when is going after your own selfish desires at the expense of others love? It is one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to see. Trying to romanticize these people's selfish behavior did NOT work. I felt no sympathy for the English patient or his lover. The Bridges of Madison County was much better -- at least you could sympathize with the characters, unlike this film. So many of the scenes were so long and drawn out I nearly fell asleep. The plot was not hard to follow, it was just boring! I don't need a lot of action in a film. I do need a story that will hold my interest. This did not. Don't waste your time on this extremely bad film."
5,Adventures of TinTin,"Like any other European, Francophile or other kid, I grew up with Herges ""The adventures of TinTin"". And while it took me a while I eventually realized that the reason I liked this movie so much was that it was a TinTin adventure. What with the airplanes in the desert (Le crabe aux pinces d'or), mysterious indians, crumbling towers, statues that get blown up (L'oraille casse) well, it quite captures the milieu of the first part of the 20th century.Therefore, highly recommended for fans of unadulterated romantic adventures."
5,The best movie of the '90's,"If any movie could ever come close to being in the same class as Casablanca, this movie is it. I'll admit this movie is not for everybody, but the finest effort I have seen since Rain Man."
4,Memorable Movie,"Loved this movie years ago in the theater & saw it multiple times on the big screen. I had the movie on VHS which was OK until I bought my Blu-ray player. This is the perfect type of movie for Blu-ray. The cinematography is incredible & every detail comes thru. The music is beautiful, intriguing & adds so much to capture the feel of the time & place of this movie. I would give the DVD 5 stars except for the fact that it doesn't have English subtitles. I enjoy having subtitles even though I'm not hard of hearing because I don't want to miss anything in the dialogue."
5,Better late than never...,"I put off seeing this movie for years because it was the brunt of so many jokes when it first came out, and I've never particularly liked Kristin Scott Thomas. So I repeatedly skipped it on cable until there was nothing else on one night and I just happened to start watching. There was an instant connection. It's a beautiful movie and I've since bought the DVD and soundtrack. I have a whole new appreciation of Ralph Finnes and Juliet Binoche, and I have since bought several DVDs of their movies. I almost missed one of the best movies I've ever seen because I pre-judged it based on other peoples opinions. While feedback from others is helpful, you need to make up your own mind based on your own response to the movie."
5,Patience brings out layers of depth,"A Favorite Film. many layers and subplots, some more obvious than others.The characters are so believable I am suspended in the Italian Country side during WW11. Incredible sets and cinematography immerse the eye. It touches every sense..from ink on textured paper to the tinkling of tiny bottles on a camels back. Letting us soar in the air then dip into a ""Swimmers Cave"" aa we feel the passion in unspoken resonance and grief in a place called ""Palace of the Winds"". A love story within a love story, so entwined that they become one tale of many loves. Timeless.Katherine Rosengren"
1,Boring...,"I thought this was a depressing, boring, and very slow film. The main character was not sympathetic, as he was self-centered, egotistical, and an adulterer. Save your money,and don't waste your time watching this tripe."
2,The English Patient,"The beautiful cinematography in this film is in sharp contrast to the violation of a basic principle of good story telling. The characters are simply unlikable. Asking an audience to feel empathy for the two lead characters or their situation stretches the bounds of verisimilitude to the breaking point. By the end of the first fifteen minutes, you'll be praying for the two to be buried in a sandstorm. They are insufferable. The condolence hoped for the ""heroine"" left dying in some forgotten cave (she might still be out there!) is best reserved for anyone who successfully suffers through this disaster."
2,Groan...,"If you find adultry as hopelessly romantic, then this is the movie for you. The beautiful images and sweeping landscapes conjure up a tale of old, when women were often prisonners in an arranged marriage to an evil husband, and their lovers rescued them from fair castles. However, the heroine is merely a girl who married before she knew what she wanted, and the hero merely a man who is stealing his best friend's wife. These characters solve problems by running away from them, not by staying true to themselves."
1,Blew Their Second Chance,Another lost sale. I simply don't understand why this film is being re-released without a Director's Commentary. Anthony Minghella had the time and inclination to annotate Truly Madly Deeply. So much for the notion that Miramax is more interested in quality than more mainstream studios.
1,Choppy glorification of adultery,"This movie is the most overrated movie of the last few years. It's too long and it's poorly directed. I realize that everyone who turns to this review will be a fan of the movie in advance, which is why you're here, but I have to disagree with you all, and with The Academy, and go in writing saying this is not much of a movie. I was happy that the adulterous lady ended up the way she did. Actually I think I'd leave the whole movie in a cave somewhere. Dippy pseudo-romance that goes on and on, and there's no one to root for or care about. I hate these people."
2,Why Would I care about The Characters?,"The movie is well done and nicely acted. But as for me, it lacks the main ingredient of a story: I did not care about the characters at all. Why would I, anyway? Why should I sympathize with two adulterers? And if the viewer does not care about the characters, this movie becomes excruciatingly long and boring. I found myself fast forwarding many a scene."
4,The Patient English,"This isn't exactly entertaining, but there's so many brain-dead movies out there, that I'm glad movies like these are made. A worthwhile 3 hours for the literary-minded."
3,A mezmorizing romance during WW2,"Ralph Fiennes puts on a wonderful show as the the adventurous explorer with Kristen Scott Thomas (Random Hearts, not saying that is a good movie). An almost surreal adventure into a romantic world of treachrey, seduction and deciet. Ralph Fiennes is simply amazing as the Hungarian count lost in a war that he does not beleive in, and torn between the love of a women and what he knows is right. Willem Dafoe and Jurgen Prochnow also make memerable appearences throughout the film, most notably during an especially gruesome torture scene in Tobruk in 1942. Amazing, thoughtful, good film."
2,"Kitchy, predictable love story....","Maybe I disliked this movie so much because of the 'hype' built around it as such a great movie, which I've greatly heard about before seeing it, while I had a hard time sitting and watching it, trying to distinguish it from all other on screen love stories. The title of this review says it all: the story of the patient is predictable, and there is not one original scene or situation in this movie that you cannot find in other romantic films.The reason this movie deserves 2 stars is the superb acting, which is the only reason I can understand why this movie was made up to be such a great film. I just wish this set of actors and actresses would find a script to fit their great talents next time!"
2,Just like the National Geographic!,"A silly, unbelievable story, beautifully photographed. This is the kind of mindless pap that passes for art in America--weird hero commits adultery with sexy heroine, who then dies, but Wonder of Wonders, her body never undergoes rigor mortis or decomposes, so that he can come back weeks later and carry her away. Urppp!!!"
5,Romatic,"This has got to be the most romantic movie ever made. It puts ""love conquers all"" to the test. The setting of this movie really made it work. Sublime acting from everyone, especially Juliette Binoche, who won a well-deserved Oscar."
3,Good movie but better read a book,"The movie lost the EXACT plot of original novel dealing with anti-war and anti-Western colonialism.Kip exposed his angry when Hiroshima was bombed and he blamed so-called civilized nations for doing the same silly thing in war.Then Almasy took his life ,not for Katharine,but for reason that cruel and deceptive world not worth living for.You find this scene in movie?No.And never.Read the book if you want to appreciate real value of classic literature.Maybe you'll come back here and delete rating-stars."
5,A CLASSIC MOVIE,"ENGLISH PATIENT is a classic. The Collector's Edition includes in-depth interviews from the director, film editor, and some cast members. These extras heightened my enjoyment of a truly stirring movie."
4,Kristen Scott-Thomas pulled through!,"I heard distubring rumors that the filming of the movie nearly came to a halt because Kristen Scott-Thomas did not rank very highly with audiences, that the director was actually pressured into replacing her with Michelle Pfeifer. Let me tell you, I am soooo thankful that Kristen Scott-Thomas ended up playing the female lead. It takes a strong English actress with a background in Shakespearean theater to play such a dramatic role."
5,A Beautiful Motion Picture Experience,"There's no need for me to give an indepth review of this film or why I love it so much, as there are plenty of other well-written reviews here. I'm merly putting in my two-cents. I love The English Patient, I love everything about it. The characters, the performances, the dialogue, the score, the cinematography, all top-notch. The picture is completely absorbing, and the fact that it jumps between stories and periods of time and is still completely coherent, is quite an accomplishment. And the love story is one of the best ever put on film, the chemistry between Fiennes and Scott Thomas is magnificent. Minghella was one of the great filmmakers of his time, always approaching his material with originality and a unique stamp. This is the way all films sould be made, with tract and grace, and patience and skill. Skeptics, don't go with the popular hate crowd, see the film and judge for yourself. I completely recommend it, it's one of my all-time favorite films."
1,Here we go again ...,"Imagine a classified ad for a Spring Break vacation: ""meaningless sex and adultery in picturesque, exotic locations."" TEP's version of the same would read, ""as carried out by stuffy, boring, uptight characters without any passion, chemistry, or excitement whatsoever.""Deprived of an aristocracy of their own, the nekulturny American masses periodically abase themselves before celluloid Brits and proclaim them divine.Well, OK, Britain does have divine acting, but this film ""ain't it"". TEP has no nutritional value, just pretty packaging. Time to wake up, people."
1,Boring...,"It took me three separate tries to get through this movie. It is pondorously boring. The characters are not believable, and the story is contrived. I could not have cared less what happened to these people."
1,A bad piece of science fiction,The intelligence level of the people who love this film is evident by the fact that none of these reviews have pointed out the improbability of Count Goulash surviving third degree burns from before the German invasion of North Africa (1940-41) to the liberation of Italy and V-E day (1945). He would have died of infection and dehydration long before.
1,Beautiful but vapid,"I was VERY disappointed with this movie. There's no arguing that the Saharan cimematography was anything but excellent. My main complaint is that the primary romance (Fiennes' and Scott Thomas' characters) was not believable. Her character had no character! She's beautiful, but that's it. This couple's relationship is strictly lust. Plus it offends me greatly that once again Hollywood has glamorized adultery! The relationship between Hana (Juliette Binoche) and Kip (Naveen Andrews) was believable AND real. I really wanted to like this movie but I can't. I couldn't buy into the Fiennes - Scott Thomas relationship. Plus, I refuse to ""root for"" two adulterers."
1,Boring!!!!!!!!,I actually watched this film twice because the reviews were good and I thought I must have missed something. The first time I had trouble paying attention it was so dull. The second time I had trouble staying awake. I have seen it twice and don't even recall what it was about. Why do people like this film?
1,hhhmm...,this movie on demand is poor.i wanted to enjoy the movie but everytime the actors would speak you can hear loud noises that would drown them out.so i had to read up on the movie on wikipedia.because i missed important parts of what was being said.
1,You love it...or you hate it..it seems to be that way!!!,"Having watched this film three times since 1996,I keep revisiting it hoping that maybe something in me would change to make me like this film more,but it hasn't!!!When a movie wins nine Academy Awards I think,maybe the ""intelligentia"" knows better.They don't!!!This film is positively plodding. The acting or the screenplay is not anything exceptional in any way.(No small wonder that Fiennes and Scott-Thomas were beat out!)I am a person who is usually moved by what I see,but the more I view this picture,the more I realize why the SEINFELD show dedicated a whole episode to their hate of this movie.When I revisit the nominees for 1996 I see what a weak field this film was up against,but certainly FARGO,SHINE,SECRETS AND LIES and even JERRY MAGUIRE were more compelling than this 3-hour bore.To each his/her own.You will either love it or hate it.I preferred the latter vehemently!"
2,"How this movie received a ""Best Picture"" award is a mystery","What a disappointment! Truly, when I viewed this movie, I expected more out of it. The movie's plot was shaky, and very weak. Furthermore, the movie did not have any ""substance"" to it. I would probably watch this movie if I did not have anything better to do."
5,Definately a favourite,"It is every aspect about this film which makes it my all time favourite. The cinematography, the beautiful backdrop of both the desert and italy, and the understated passion of the characters' romance."
3,Long but well-made film,"The English Patient: Is it a classic? Only time will tell. The cinematorgraphy was for more interesting than the two main characters, though I did like most of the actors in the film, (Binoche, Fiennes, Dafoe). The story itself however, left a lot to be desired. For three hours I would have expected more of an understandable ending and the flashback scenes kept weaving in & out like stitches. Worth the rental if you like any of the lead actors or if you just want to see a long cinematic soap opera, but if you're a fan of Seinfeld's ""Nothing""-ness you've probably been warned."
3,Characters unclearly defined & a waste of talent of Fiennes,"I understand that the book was worthreading because of the ""poetry"" in the method of writing. However, the film seemed chopped up, and the many characters lacked careful defining. Although beautifully shot some scenes seemed to be thrown IN or OUT without reason. However, the worst error was the decision to literally mask Ralph Fiennes face with make-up when he appeared as the burned patient. It would have been possible to let the facial scaring be to one side of the face so that we could see the emotions and better hear this talented method actor. I believe, had this been done, the Academy award would have been his!"
5,Name has power,"Excelent movie, but sad. Too bad they don't make movies like this one anymore. The acting, photography, sound, everything was well matched for a good and unusually long movie. No wonder it got the Oscar."
5,Beautiful story and beautiful soundtrack!,Enjoyed this movie immensely. The sweeping vista's and the wonderful soundtrack. The story is haunting and unforgettable. Character actors were perfectly cast. Highly recommended.Thank you.
2,Missing Essential Features,The DVD is a great disappointment because of the lack of any special features at all. The movie is great but this is a bare bones DVD with nothing extra. The director has actually done a audio commentary for this film that was available on laser disk. When are we going to see this on DVD? Come on Miramax this was a pretty lame effort; we would like a DVD with more features? Why waste a directors commentary on an obsolete format?
3,Poor Blu Ray,"The movie is definitely one of the best movies ever made, I'd give 5 stars to it but what I'm rating here is the actual BluRay Disc.I expected all BluRay Discs to come in the best available format to date which is 1080p/24fps, but this one comes in a lower quality format which is 1080i. Hence, I wonder, what's the purpose of buying this in BluRay Disc format? It really looks grainy, and it's unfair to a movie which won best cinematography.The DTS sound is definitely very good.The thing that annoys me most; is that it comes without any subtitles or any extra features at all, feels like playing a VHS.Movies like ""Coming to America"" from 1988 (That's 8 years before The English Patient)has been restored in a much better glory than this one, which means it is possible to sell a better product they just didn't care to."
1,DEVIL IN A BOX,"This is a Christian based movie that is all around bad. It starts off with a pseudo-history of the Aztecs. The demon Azar has been locked in a light weight box with a 20th century lock since the 16th century. His eye symbol looks like a 50's wallpaper design. He is now loose in the 20th century and create zombie fighters who are more like zombie hippies. A skeptic FBI man is chasing everything down, and because he is a skeptic everyone is a little snarky with him. The acting was very bad as was the script. Special affects include makeup and placing a filter lens on a camera and shaking it around. It may be fun to watched stone, but I wouldn't try it.The R rating was really confusing. No bad language, no sex, no nudity. No real blood or gore...oh wait wasn't that a body missing a head? Looks like it was filmed in super VHS. I'm surprised it was in color."
1,UH OH,"There's this movie called TAIL STING about a giant scorpion on a plane that I have considered the worst movie I've ever watched but it's like GONE WITH THE WIND compared to this hideous film. Never have I seen such horrible acting or direction. They never show the creature; there are no special effects, and the makeup looks like kids at Halloween. There's a long expository narrative that tries to tell you what the movie's about, but it's absurd. The whole movie is so bad you have to wonder why you watched the whole thing. Do yourself a favor..AVOID!!!"
2,Not as Stated,"I purchased these blades becacause they say they are the MASTER COBALT, they are not.The are a skinny cheaper version. They burn up quickly if you are cutting anything of any thickness. They are maybe 1/2 inch. Not even close to 3/4.I didn't try and return them because I tried to return a couple things to amazon and they blew me off, they said ""that item"" must be returned to vendor. Yeah you know how that works out.Probably the last thing I buy through amazon.But that is my review on the blades.BTW. It doesn't say anywhere that the picture may not be the actual product.Have a great day. Buyer Beware.Ron"
1,Didn't know this was microscopic.,Had to donate to Goodwill - didn't know these were so TINY. I was looking for more of an dip/sauce size bowl. Oh well!
5,This book inspired me to create my own Keepsake Cookbook.,"I was inspired to start a keepsake cookbook to record my family's food-related traditions before I even made it through the first 2 chapters! I think the book is simple and easy to understand. The author lists many resources throughout the book to help you make your own keepsake cookbook easier. Being an avid scrapbooker, this book has given me another way to preserve memories and another way to use my scrapbooking zeal! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for ways to record cherised family memories."
5,Accumulair Diamond Filter,Excellent product (13x21x1 (Actual Size) Accumulair Diamond Filter (MERV 13)) arrived on a timely basis. Would recommend this particular product to anyone.
5,"Great product, cleaner air","You can notice the difference within a day of using these filters, I am happy how better we breathe with these filters"
1,Damaged......,The French Kiss CD arrived damaged.The sellers said they wanted to help but we've never received any more correspondence from them and no other CD has been sent to us.Very disappointed.
4,Romantic and uplifting - a great escape.,The sound track to French Kiss takes you away to a place of dreams and timelessness - warm sunny afternoons in Paris cafes or southern France. It's romantic and uplifting and one of my favorites to listen to when I need to get away from the hustle and bustle. A must for any francophile.
5,french kiss,Very good love story worth seeing more than once or twice. Charming story. Actors Charming together. Music wonderful. Scenery is lovely.
5,Music for the Movie in My Head,"I never saw the movie--my best friend, a major movie-holic, lent me the CD, saying she thought I'd like it. Was she right! I must've listened to it 100 times before I finally gave it back to her and now it's on my wish list (Clio, are you reading this?). If nobody gives it to me for Xmas, I'll buy it myself. It is just great movie music that evokes so many feelings, and you never get tired of listening to it. It would be hard to pick a favorite track, but I love ""Someone Like You"" (a gorgeous, romantic, well-orchestrated ballad); ""Les Yeux Ouverts"" (nice, relaxed French groove); ""I Want You"" (I could fall in love to this one too); ""La Mer"" (surprisingly, Kevin Klein can carry a tune, and the arrangement and the song suit his voice very well, making the thing a nice little package); and ""I Love Paris"" (kicky and fun). Jeez, that's just about the whole CD! I recommend this to anybody. It's just good music with a nice French feeling to it."
2,Ripped on second use,"It is very cute but...it ripped along a seam after the second use. Also since the bottom of the handle is not a hook but buzz, you can't hang it up to dry."
2,bubble liquid spills out,This item has to be loaded with the bubble solution and closely monitored by an adult to avoid spills. Even an adult can spill the solution causing a huge mess that is difficult to clean up. It does make a nice amount of bubble when in use.
3,Great Fun,I purchased two of these for Christmas presents.Not made to play with very much. Would not hold up to rough kidplaying.It is a great display item and an ocaisonal wind up is great to watch.
1,Disappointing,"I have an older addition of this game, and thought this one would be even better. What a disappointment! The older game is much better. You can't even do a lot of things playing this one that you could with the older version. The options are terrible! New versions are suppose to be better, not worse!"
1,Have You Thought of Jack Coler and Ronald Williams Today?,I thought about Peltier when I went by the FBI Memorial and saw the faces of Jack Coler and Ronald Williams. Has anyone thought about them and what their families went through?Too bad nobody has written a book about that.
1,Covered Wagon Women,"I can't really review this item because the seller sent the wrong book, I had to return it, and I am waiting for my refund now."
1,Couldn't agree more,"A huge disappointment! I was ""tricked"" into purchasing this dvd, thinking GLOW was finally upping the ante, giving fans what they want, and releasing a really cool 3 dvd set. I was completely wrong. This is simply a repackaging of the previously released volumes 1-3. Unfortunately, this was not revealed in any item description anywhere on any site. This could be the nail in GLOW's coffin. If the fans keep getting treated with these lame dvd releases that are simply not the ""best"" of GLOW than we're going to finally lose interest.A last plea for full season box set releases! I would also happily pay $50 to $60 for it and so would other fans I'm sure. If all else fails, at least release an episode from season 1 for god's sake. At least that really is the best!"
1,what a disappointment!,"This review is going to be a little harsh.I read the reviews for this book and was SO excited for it to come. Well I couldn't even read the whole thing because I was so bored out of my mind. The author attempts humor but it honestly just isn't funny. Her stories have no flow to them and you end up wondering what the first 1 or 2 paragraphs have to do with the rest of the story. The writing was also terrible in my opinion. I work in this industry so I've seen my fair share of hilarious things but I could write a better book than this author. I can't even comprehend how this has gotten any good reviews but I wouldn't waste your money on this ""book""."
3,"Great band, poor collection","Don't even think about getting this one. Pure Prairie League was a great band, both with Craig Fuller and even after he departed, and before the arrival of Vince Gill. This compilation does a very poor job showcasing the strongest songs that the band did. Besides the bizarre re-arranging of the first two legendary tracks, there is only one tune from the excellent ""Two Way Highway"" album, and of all the cover versions they could pick from, they chose the mediocre rendition of ""That'll be the Day."" Who puts together these things? It's no wonder the labels are hurting. They lost the plot. If you want to hear more from this fine band, get one of the 2-for collections that are out there, but not this weak compilation."
3,Amie? Really?,"Okay, I agree that the producers really screwed up on the order of Amie and Falling In and Out of Love, but that is an easy correction on iTunes and other media players - just switch the tracks. When I listened to these two songs my ear seemed to fail me. Two hours later, and some RCA hookups, I played my vinyl record from the err... time period. Sorry, folks, it just ain't the same as the broadcast version. Sad, because this is the set of songs that I believe made this group so well known. Everybody who was anybody loved the pairing of these two songs.This CD is not a loser though as there are precious tracks contained within. Vince, you rock, and I loved hearing your outstanding voice on many of the tracks. Well, I'll be dishing out some more cash to get the correct recording of Falling In and Out of Love and Amie."
5,"""Two Lane Highway"" one of the greats!","How can we forget that it was Larry Goshorn who sang ""Amie"" on tour? Craig Fuller may have written it, but he was no longer with the group when this song became a hit. It was Larry who sang this song and helped make it the hit that it became. I give Craig his 'Props"", but lets not forget the beautiful sound of Larry's voice. He did at least 7 albums with PPL and his melodic voice will always be my favorite. ""Kentucky Moonshine"", ""Memories"" and other songs by Larry were some of the groups best. Period."
5,Vince with PPL,"Love the album. It's a wonderful tribute to the early days of Vince's career. His voice was ringing out loud and clear even in those days. What a sweet voice! Love, Debbie Vince and Amy's Sister In Christ"
3,Reasonably good book,"This is a reasonably good book, but I actually prefer David Drake's shorter stories (like the ones in the Complete Hammer's Slammers vol. 1). I've only read the first story in this one so far, and although it was enjoyable to read, it felt a little bit too long and drawn out."
5,DVD coming in 2013 from Scorpion Releasing,"Just wanted to give everyone a heads up that Scorpion Releasing now has the rights to this and will be releasing it in 2013 on DVD and possibly Blu-Ray, so keep an eye out for it!"
2,A mistitled mockery?,"I quite agree with Darkgenius' comments on this book. It does not actually give any of the answers that the title implies. Rather, it seems like a kind of satire of nonbelieving parents, churches and Sundayschools. I read it and felt more like it was poking fun at the whole question rather than offering helpful advice. Additionally, the presence of 2 or 3 uses of d--n, 1 use of a--, a reference to Junior's parents being ""in the sack"", as well as other less-than-reverant elements all make me wonder if this book is really meant as a mockery, rather than a helpful guide. It certainly wasn't written from the perspective of a Christian parent."
1,Not A Romance,"The book reads like an X rated movie with non-stop sex. The ""hero"" sleeps with EVERY female character throughout the book, and the ""heroine"" is taken advantage of by EVERY male character. I don't know much about movie business, but I don't think that in a historical drama such as the one they are filming in this book all the sex scenes are real actions. The part where the heroine is being gang-raped by the secondary actor and ALL the extras on the set, while the hero turns his back and pretends it's nothing, really sickens me. I can believe that Steve and Ginny love each other in the historical ""Sweet Savage Love"", but I couldn't find in any part of this book the element of love, only lust. When Webb turns out to be some sort of secret agent at the end it's only laughable to me. BTW, if you like steamy contemporary ROMANCE please read ""Love Play"". I think Rosemary Rogers is one of the most talented romance author. It's a pity that sometimes she writes porn, not romance."
4,Rosemary's still talented...,"...even when she's trying to write a Jackie Collins-style novel...This is not a historical romance, so lose any such notions. This is a good read with plenty of ""action"" and after all, it's not supposed to be true-to-life believable! Take it on vacation, you won't be disappointed! (Along with Sweet Savage Love, of course -- still #1 from Rosemary Rogers in my opinion.)"
4,Works well,"I know this product has received mixed reviews. All I can say is it works for me.1) I drive a Honda, the radio is set up in 0.2mhz increments. If I can find a dead station, anyone can.2) Max the volume on your player3) Cigarette lighter adapter works well.I have used around town and on long trips (5-8 hours). The only thing you need to be aware of is having to hunt for a new station as you drive X distance.Sound quality can be controlled by the player, as the transmitter uses the headphone jack.If your going to bass boost the player, set the radio to flat until you hear what it sounds like.I use mine with a Creative Zen Vision:M. Does the job, and does it for a reasonable price."
5,I looooove it!!!,It's decent for the price. real small. it has a great range on it. i leave it in my bedroom and listen to it all over the house. it has clear sound and signal as well. i guess it all depends on your configuration :).
1,Static and intermittent from day one,"The DLO TransCast FM device seems like a great idea. It is small and packaged nicely. I thought I was getting a great deal at $20, but the device was intermittent and staticy from day one. After I gave up on it, I tore the device open and discovered a cracked solder joint on the socket where the power jack plugs in. Even though the root cause could have been a cold solder joint (manufacturing problem), I suspect failure was because the tiny socket wasn't mechanically secured. The force of plugging in the jack was borne completely by the PC board pad and solder."
2,The problem is impedance...,"The problem with is with impedance. Yes, it works with my Zen MP3 player. No, it doesn't work with my ATT Tilt Cellphone. The problem is the impedance is different. The DLO wants low impedance..like for a typical headset. My cellphone puts out a high impedance to its headset.So, the issue can be resolved for $2.99. Go to Radio Shack and buy the 8 ohm-to-1000 ohm audio transformer. You'll need to do a little soldering, but it works. Why didn't they incorporate different impedanc einto the device? YOu can figure it cost more that way---* Beck"
1,It doesn't work.,"This device arrived, nicely packaged and all but it doesn't work.First I tried it out by connecting it to the headphone output of my computer (I did check that something was playing). Next I plugged it into the headphone socket of an MP3 player. Using the headphones, I confirmed that something was playing. I even held the DLO Transmitter right next to the receiving radio's antenna and tuned the radio to surrounding frequencies in case the display was inaccurate.To check that it wasn't the radio or the DLO battery, I tried it in the car, using the car charger. Still no go, so I removed the battery and relied on the charger alone. Same result.What a disappointment! I see that many others have had similar experiences with this product."
1,sucks,"Constant fm hiss, reception and output vary in the area of the car. Do not buy this item. I bought it from best buy at 50$ which also pisses me off. 20$ more and it isn't worth the 30$ I wish I had paid for it."
1,too much static,This FM transmitter gave off too much static which ruined the sound quality whenever car engine was running. I tried it in both a GM(cadillac) and a Ford. The battery can only be charged in the car and lasts about 1 hour and 15 minutes if you use it in the house. Also it needs to be about 3 feet from the FM receiver.
2,Not easy to use,It is awkward to use because my hand slides forward as I iron which then hits the spray button and water gets on the part I just ironed. Messy. The balance feels off somehow. Hard to use the tip for corners. Just not happy with this one.
1,what ever happened to ergonomics???,"This iron is heavy and awkward to hold. Its controls are inconvenient, inaccessible and so small they are difficult to read and manipulate. This is not a good design."
2,Don't waste your time.,"My wife and I bought this Iron 3 days ago on a whem from Wal-mart. I used it for the first time ironing my shirt for Sunday morning service. First, there is too much friction between your clothes and the plate. Second, the retractable cord feature is nice but got in my way while ironing. Third, it was a little hard to put water in. The opening was a little small for me. Finally, IT LEAKS. This thing messed up a shelf in my closet."
1,Drippy,"This is the drippiest iron i have ever used, doesn't matter what temperature it's on, it still drips."
1,Worst Iron I've ever owned,"I usually keep an iron until it wears out, but I'm not going to struggle with this one anymore. I'm getting another one this weekend and donate this one to the Salvation Army. It's heavy and awkward, the tip does not get corners well, and the ""non-stick"" surface does NOT glide smoothly across the fabric - it seems to drag on the fabric and I do not get a smooth, ironed finish. I end up pressing the iron to the fabric and steaming - not actually ironing. I always have to unplug it. When you shut it off it has an indicator light that continues to blink. I want the iron to completely shut off. (As others have mentioned - it does drip)."
4,Sunbeam 4222 Steam Master,"This is a good steady and, so far, reliable iron. Ironing is done quickly due to the good amount of steam that comes out of the unit. The retractable cord is a plus. Another plus about the iron is the large water resevoir. The only minus that come to mind is the weight of the unit - it is fairly heavy for its size."
4,Great Iron,"I owned the Sunbeam 4220 for six years and it finally stopped working. This is basically the exact same iron but it has the EXCELLENT feature of having a retractable cord. I bought this iron without any hesitation due to my great experience with the previous model. Those who say there is a lot of friction between the plate and the clothes, just give it some time. the plate has a sort of ""break in"" period where it seems a little ""sticky"" in the beginning. After a few uses, it will glide over your clothes like glass. One thing to watch out for is try not to spill any water on the iron itself when filling it up. I think that's what killed my last one. That's the only down side and the reason it got 4 stars instead of 5. I got this at Bed Bath and Beyond for $24 after using the 20% off coupon."
2,Get another CD,"I liked some of the songs, but not all of them. I don't think Favorite things is a Christmas song"
5,"great ""green"" product","It smells divine. Works great, daily, on my short hair. Rinses sqeaky clean and doesn't waste plastic bottles!"
5,The best!,"This is the only shampoo I have used for over 15 years. I have a beard and very fine hair, and it keeps both clean and oil-free. I can't say enough good things about Liggett's Bar Shampoo."
2,sticky,"i was trying to simplify my hygiene routine so i purchased this bar shampoo hoping it would be a good two in one for my naturally curly hair. i was definitely wrong. it has a very drying sticky consistency when you use it in the shower, but seems to leave my hair oily afterwards. i will not be using or purchasing this product again."
1,Made my hair sticky and dull,"I have used JR Liggetts bar shampoo in the past and had good results, but this herbal formula did not work out for me. After using it, my hair became dull, tangled (even when using conditioner) and started to break. I don't know why the other kind worked for me but not this one. I used a regular shampoo (Aveeno) and my hair was mostly okay again. I'll just use the remainder of this as a body wash."
1,If only I weren't allergic to it!,I loved the scent and the way it made my actual hair feel and look BUT oh no! My scalp went wild with an allergic reaction to an ingredient. Not sure which one.It is most likely a more unique thing to some people but beware that it is a possiblity.Fiddle sticks! If only I hadn't had it happen.
1,Ugh! Tangles! DRIES out your hair,"Reading the ingredients list, you'd think this shampoo would be great. But it isn't.It dries out your hair, and leaves it a tangled mangled mess. And as the previous reviewer said, it leaves your hair ""dull"".I use a TON of hair products, and let me tell you, this one is the worst.Under no circumstances would I recommend this product."
3,pilates dvd,the dvd is good quality and the instructor certainly knows her stuff. these are basic pilates mat moves for a beginner so form is key here. moves a bit too slow for me and is very repetitive. overall ok.
5,"Fluffy and cute, will ride on your shoulder","Lifesize, very realistic cute face. Fur almost feels real.Very huggable, ""enjoys"" being placed in doll carriage to ride with dolls.Will cuddle with other toys, whether they are plushy or not.Also looks great on your sofa. Real kitties might find this critter an enjoyable cuddle as well.Surface washable."
5,great,My husband was very happy with this Christmas present. It has the songs that he remembers from so long ago.
2,Lasted about 6 months outdoors,"Came as expected, but didn't last too long. I used it for a fence gate. After about 6 months of use outdoors, it was getting rusty and got to a point where it would not close. Indoors or kept out of the rain it might have done better."
5,Nice and Soft,My family loved their flannel sheet gifts. They are nice and soft and very comfy. Highly recommended!
4,Excellent resource for the vintage lightweight bicycle buff,"This 20 year old book has rather usual advice for fitting & buying a racing style bike, much of which is now seriously outdated, but what is uniquely valuable are the interviews & visits with famous bike builders in four countries. Sante Pogliaghi, Jack Taylor, and others, all dead now and collectible as examples of a bygone age of fine handmade cycle artisans. No other publication has done this and this book is a great resource and testimonial."
5,Ice Cream in a Backpack!,"These are crazy and amazing. They look just like a regular ice cream bar, minus the cold and melty. The boys I took on the scout adventure loved them, as did I. I love crunchy snacks, so crunchy icecream was right up my ally. The boys loved the flavor and the novelty. They were the perfect ending to a long hike and a delicious Mountain House lasagna meal."
4,Good film!,The film is a lot of fun but was not quite what I remembered it to be when I first saw it at the cinema 30 years ago
4,Long Lost Comedy Gem,"I am sure there are those of you out there that remember this comedy-western form the late 70's. For those of you that don't, I highly recommend this movie. Gene Wilder and Harrison Ford star as an unlikely pair traveling across America in the Old West. Gene Wilder plays a rabbi trying to get to San Francisco for his own wedding. On the way he is robbed by some two-bit thieves. He teams up with Harrison Ford and the two embark on a series of humorous mishaps as they try and get back the rabbi's stolen goods including his Torah. The movie really has some funny moments and even if you are not a big western fan this movie will leave you highly entertained. It will leave you with a ""feel good"" attitude when the end credits roll. The dance number with Gene Wilder and some Indians is absolutely classic. The movie is a must for Gene Wilder fans. I feel this is one of his best movies. Watch The Frisco Kid today!"
4,A Very Underrated Comedy,"Gene Wilder turns in a hysterical tour de force performance as a bumbling rabbi trying to make his way to a new congregation in San Francisco admist the turmoil of the 1850's. Of coarse, he needs a little help from Harrison Ford, who proves he's no slouch at comedy as rugged bank robber with a heart of gold. Director Robert Aldrich provides us with enough cute humor and pratfalls to make this a family film, and just enough grit, violence and romance to keep even the most sophisticated adults engaged (no small feat). If you look behind the laughs, this is a very moving story about a man staying true to his roots despite the obstacles he faces. And if you can't see behind the laughs, they should be enough to keep you entertained anyway."
4,Should be seen comedy.,"I don't need to add more to the other reviews except Ford shows almost all the traits that made Indiana Jones so fun, except, of course, Tommy isn't quite as smart. This is one of Wilder's best character portrayals. Fun movie. DVD PLEASE!!"
5,Favorite Movie,"Absolutely the funniest movie of all time. Most remarkable, however, is how this lighthearted tale cuts to the heart of a core Jewish value. Just like a traditional rabbinic mashal (fable), one needs to watch to the very end in order to learn this important lesson. Gene Wilder showcases his remarkable comedic talent, while Harrison Ford is perfect as the tough yet loving pre-Indian Jones cowboy. I only wish I could own this film, but alas, it is yet to be released on DVD."
5,The Frisco Kid belongs on DVD,"The Frisco Kid is the original ""buddy"" movie. It is humorous, touching, and pure fun. Gene Wilder is at his best, and the young Harrison Ford shows all the promise of the established star he soon became. The timing is perfect, the setting is realistic, the dialog is believable (but always a light touch, with just the right amount of humor). This is a ""must see"" for anyone interested in good clean fun. If it was on DVD it would be a ""must own,"" as well -- suitable for the family, but made to appeal to adults."
5,Sweet and Smart,"Perfect casting and smart, light hearted writing make The Frisco Kid a very sweet western with a sincere message of what real friendship is about."
3,"Good movie, I guess","I bought this movie as a gift for my uncle, so I am not sure how good this movie is. Sorry, that I couldn't help any."
5,"The Rabbi, the Amish, the Prairie Chicken & the Peyote","I agree - one of the best comedies ever. Some of the funniest scenes:When the rabbi is wandering afoot, trying to go West, he discovers a new sect of 'rabbis', known as the Amish; he winds up making great friends.The rabbi knew nothing about hunting and was starving. He chased a Prairie Chicken, calling out ""Come here little chicken - I don't want to hurt you, I just want to eat you!'When captured by the Indians, he charms the chief and is invited to a feast. After ingesting peyote, he engages in debate with the chief about the God of the Jews also being the God of the indians.The best performance Gene Wilder ever gave. PLEASE PUT IT ON DVD."
5,True Friendship Defined Against All Odds,"Alone in a hostile new world with nothing more than simple faith, determination, and the clothes on his back, a lonely outcast of a rabbi finds a helper, guide, and ""best friend"" in an outlaw cowboy. Recently saw the edited and watered down ""Frisco Kid"" on network tv (""Meshuggana"" dubbed for ""A__hole"" at least 3X) and now want to have my own unadulterated copy. It's a movie that will warm and tickle your heart at the same time."
5,An Overlooked Pleasure,"This is one of those gems, that strangely enough was completely overlooked in its theatrical release. With the talent of Wilder & Harrison playing off each other beautifully, a top director in Aldrich, the public stayed away in droves, and the critics dismissed it as slow, and not working. Forget all that and enjoy the magic of the rabbi and the bandit, as they set about travelling across the USA - the best and warmest buddy movie of them all. A pleasure loaded with warmth - a true feel-good movie."
5,Great Movie!!,The unlikely mix of Gene Wilder and Harrison Ford make for excellent entertainment. I recomend this movie to anyone wanting to be entertained for a couple of hours.
4,the frisco kid,"this is the most precious movie! Gene Wilder has never played a better part! he totally kept me captivated. I will watch this movie many, many times and will recommend it to my family and friends."
2,Not what I expected,"I picked up this movie because I like Harrion Ford and I thought it might be funny. In my oppinon, watching it was a waste of time. The language was really bad, and Harrison's character had very low morals. There were a few funny parts, but nothing that stands out."
2,Unfunny,"This is pathetic. Vile language, inept writing, and silly casting. Worst: This film just isn't funny. It's a waste of Gene Wilder and Harrison Ford."
4,Classic Western Comedy,"Gene WIlder and Harrison Ford...both brilliant actors and comedic actors to boot. The plot is good, and the ensuing odd couple hijinks works really well."
4,Wonderfully light-hearted and heartening view of parenting!,Dr. Witham does a wonderful job of pulling together both witty and profound quotes on parenting that remind us of what is most important -- and that parents shouldn't take themselves too seriously. A perfect book for the day the toddler pulls over the plant and spills juice while the 4-year-old draws on the walls!
5,Hot,"All critics called it really bad but in my opinion, I think this is a pretty good movie. Why didn't they criticized Ashlee Simpson as much? I think her movie was far worst than Paris Hiltons. Of course, if you're a Paris fan, you'll probably enjoy it like I did. She started acting in this movie so, nobody could expect much but I think she did a pretty good job for a first-timer. I give it 5 stars despite all the critics out there. PARIS FOREVER!!!"
1,OMFG!!! THIS IS A NIGHTMARE MOVIE!!!,"I dont get it!! I love Paris Hilton but this movie is horrible!!! I bought it and I thought this movie would be good but it's not!! Anyone out there that never see this movie PLEASE do not buy this movie!! This movie is non-sense, terrible, horrible and it's dumb!!! Not worth buying this movie EVER!!!"
1,Worst Movie Ever,"Plan 9 was better than this. I watched it cause I'm a Paris fan... the dark hair just looked wrong... and Jason Mewes cracks me up... but... he was terrible. Glad he appears clean during filming, but... playing the romantic lead, not his thing. Poopy Trip!"
2,Bottoms Up,"This movie is pretty bad, although it's not bad enough to deserve a one star rating. And it's not bad just because Paris Hilton is in it. Sure, she couldn't act if her life depended on it, but the biggest problem is the weak script. It's only occasionally funny, but most of the jokes fall flat. It also seems to try to be part serious drama, but this only makes it slower and even less funny. ""Bottoms Up"" is not good enough to recommend. And what's with all the blatant product placement for Golden Palace online casino?"
5,Great film!,"this isn't that bad of a movie,, i mean if you go in expecting only so much, look at it this way, you have Paris Hilton,now she doens't run around half naked in this one like House of Wax,, i know big disappointment there, the plot, well there ain't much of one,, i mean it is a barrel full of laughs all the way,, especially the bit about the gay uncle.. basically the main character has to win a bartending contest, and when he doens't win , he has to find a way to make money in Hollywood,, so he can bring it back to his dad to save his restauraunt in Minnesotta, all in all the movie was funny , yeah some was lame,, but all in all though it wasn't near as bad as people make it out to be."
1,Wrong product received,The product was Quorum after shave BALM in the advertisement. I received another Quorum product which I did not want. I sent an e-mail asking for an explanation and did not receive a reply. They have my money and just don't care I suppose. I will NEVER use them again. Have a nice day...
1,Rather disappointed,"I'm a big fan of historical gay fiction, but this book was very disappointing. Too much time was spent in the beginning of the book building the central character up, which unfortunately wasn't done with much interest or skill. The main disappointment however was the lack of any true passion in the intimate scenes. They were VERY few and far between, and often just a few sentences in length. If this element is important to you then I would not recommend this book."
3,Pretty Good,"This book is pretty good. I know that sounds wishy washy, but that sums it up well. I found, as another reviewer said, the foreign languages that weren't translated to be annoying. Sorry, we don't ALL speak Italian. This strikes me as a good summer read. I don't know that I'd recommend this book to anyone, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading it either. I am sitting on the fence! (I'd have given it 2.5 stars out of 5, but that's not an option...)"
2,Pretentious and overwritten,"The kind of book that frequently uses Italian or French phrases and never translates them for you. Also, the author apparently assumes you have an intimate knowledge of the geography of Elba before reading the book."
3,The Shaq attack now in Miami...he's changed.,"I do agree that some sections he repeats himself, and caught myself wondering if I had read that section already. I do like his conversational approach though as it seems like he's just talking right to you. Nowhere does it mention in the 'laws of book etiquette' that you have to be a prolific writer to release a book.I've read the whole book and thoroughly enjoyed it and how it gave the readers an insight on how Shaq views the NBA, how the underachieving pre-Jackson Lakers REALLY were, and most rewarding, his upbringing and how his parents raised him.Don't expect the same Shaq in this book than what he portrays now. As he's contradicted himself a bit in light of recent events regarding his trade to Miami. Nevertheless, I do recommend this book as a casual and humorous read.- Laker fan for life, thanks Shaq for your dominance"
3,Verbosity deminishes an otherwise candid and compelling book,"This book is a definite page-turner. I have to admit that once I started this book I couldn't put it down. I read the whole thing in one sitting. All that he had to say about his childhood, and his life on and off the court was all very interesting, but his book is massively repetative. This book seems like the first draft of something that needs to undergo several revisions. There are several pieces of information that he repeats over and over. In fact, at one point he even repeated the same piece of information twice on the same page. This book is a little over 250 pages in length, but he could have cut that number in half and still gotten his message across. However, Shaq is an athlete, and not an author, so it doesn't make sense to be overly critical. This is still a great book that I would highly recommend."
1,If You Believe This...,"Wowie! That Shaq is SUCH a nice fellow. It's so refreshing to read such an honest account of an athelete's life. Yeah, right!It's quite apparent that people who reviewed this book (book critics and readers) didn't research the ""facts"" as presented by Shaq. The book is actually a fun read as long as the reader understands that it is a fictional autobiography.Shaq claims that, as a kid, he sat in the nosebleed seats of the Alamo Dome to watch the Spurs. FACT: The Spurs did not start playing in the dome until after Shaq became a pro.He complains that Lenny Wilkens played him for 43 seconds in the gold medal game at the Olympics. Shaq must be getting forgetful in his old age. He played five minutes and had two points.If you like fiction, then I recommend you buy this book. If you want fact, then read the news."
2,shaq talks,"SHAQ'S BOOK WAS ENTERTAINING YET IT LACKED DEPTH. DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LIKE SHAQ BUT THIS BOOK IS NOT PUT TOGETHER VERY WELL NOT EDITED. IN ONE CHAPTER SHAQ TALKS ABOUT HIS CHILDHOOD AND CARING FOR HIS BROTHER'S AND SISTERS, BUT HE LEAVES THINGS ON A CLIFFHANGER. THIS IS VERY FUSTRATING BECASUE YOU AS THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS YET HE SKIPS OVER TO SOME OTHER SUBJECT AND LEAVES WHAT HE STARTED. I DID THINK THE BOOK WAS ENTERTAINING YET I FELT IT WAS NOT EDITED PROPERLY SO THAT IT FLOWED."
2,what a big joke!!!!!!!!!!!,this book is complete garbage....it has no moral or purpose just a bunch of bragging(ALTHOUGH IM A BIG LAKER FAN!)
4,Shaq Talks Back,"I have to admit I didn't have very high expectations for Shaq's new book, however after starting the book I couldn't put it down. I read the entire book in one day. Shaq provides a no holds bar account of his life and his quest for a NBA championship. The voice of the book is definetly that of ""The Big Aristotle."" The book was informative and entertaining. Shaq has great sense of humor and he has no problem speaking his mind.I suggest anyone interested in a behind scenes look at life in the NBA look no further than Shaq's latest book."
5,Couldn't Put it Down in Borders!,"You know how most basketball books are if you've read any. What struck me about Shaq's new book was its humor, its frankness, and its style. Despite the fact that I can't stand the Lakers and I love to see my Kings pound them at Arco, Shaq is a good guy who doesn't pull any punches. If you can defeat Shaq, you've defeated the best. That's why I love him as an opponent. He's honest about whom he respects and doesn't, and he also touches candidly on what it's like to be a role model for kids and how important it is for himself to be a good father. But the whole style of the book won me over, as it is written in that somewhat cocky-yet-truthful conversational tone that is so characteristic of Shaq. This book is an entertaining read for any NBA fan, for if you are a true NBA fan, you can't help but be a fan of Shaq (but still hope the Lakers tank!)."
2,Not So Special,"I once owned this book but gave it away. I didn't find anything special about any of the quilts in it and, given so many wonderful books on miniatures, I wouldn't recommend that anyone spend any money on this one."
5,Great Tee,"My husband is a big man. He needs a good t-shirt. We haven't found any better T's anywhere. Just in case you have the same question we did about choosing 6x or 5x-tall. The 5x-tall is about 2"" longer."
5,Perfect!,"I am a tall man but also a fat man. I need shirts that fit me in the upper body but are long enough to hide my belly. These shirts fit the bill plus they are heavyweight, well manufactured shirts. The chest pocket is a nice bonus as well."
1,Russell Athletic Men's Big & Tall Basic Short Sleeve T-Shirt,"I hardly ever leave reviews unless I think a product is really good, or as in this case other shoppers need to beware. Now...Since I already own some Russell Athletic T-shirts like the one pictured for this product, I went ahead and purchased two. I didn't recieve what was shown on the website or described in the product description. The shirts I recieved were of much lighter fabric and holes quickly developed on the bottom of the pockets. The fit is okay, but I'm still not real satisfied with the purchase. I should have been sent what was shown in the picture and not something cheaper and of less quality. Amazon needs to monitor their sellers a little better!!"
2,Workmanship,Russell Athletic Men's Big & Tall Basic Short Sleeve Solid Crew Neck T-Shirt With Chest PocketI purchased 4 shirts. When I received them the material was puckered along the seams under the arms. Looked like a high school home economic class did the sewing. The seam joints were misaligned also.I subsequently bought shirts from another supplier made in the same country and the workmanship was excellent. This may have been a problem with one assembly organization.
1,"Great shirt, rip-off price!","Sure the shirt is good, but if I wasn't a big fatty, I could get 6 or more Fruit of The Loom pocket T's for the price of one big fatty T. But it's like trying to buy a drink at a movie theater- they can charge what they want because you're stuck."
1,Crappy amazon,"Shirts are probably fine but took stupid amazon two and half months to get them in, kept giving me the run around, and I still don't have them. don't count on a refund either as long as they are ""on the way"" what a joke."
5,nice,He wears this shirt with comfort and ease.It fades a little with first laundried so should be washed with liked colors.Thanks //Thema
5,Great Shirt,"I seem to have trouble finding good t-shirts. What happens is that I find a shirt I like, then, for some unknown reason, the manufacturers change the fabric or discontinue the line. It's an ongoing search for the perfect shirt. If Russel Athletic doesn't discontinue this shirt, it will likely remain my favorite. Reasons why I like this shirt:1. The fabric is heavy duty, without being too heavy or rough like denim (I've had my share of denim-like t-shirts, and I don't like them)and without being paper thin.2. The fabric is soft3. It fits well. I bought one size up to allow for shrinking. Once it was washed and dried a few times, it was the perfect fit.I'll be buying more of these shirts in the future. I'm just glad I tried this one.Size appears to be fairly true, but they will shrink when you wash them, so keep that in mind."
2,shrinks even in cold wash and delicate dry,"I've worn Russell tees for about 30 years now. I'm 6'2"" tall, and used to weigh 260 - 270 pounds; they used to fit, not shrink, and have neck room.I'm down to 230 pounds, but as soon as I wash the shirt, it shrinks - even in cold water wash, and delicate dry. The neck size is more like for someone that wears a medium.I had to ""stretch"" / pull the shirt to be able to wear it; upon the 2nd washing I noticed that the stitching is falling apart.Only the Russell Premium has held up (although the neck size is smaller than XL).All tee shirts are becoming like this - I too think it's due to poor craftsmanship & sizes running smaller - due to being made outside of U.S., with no real quality control in place.Gary"
1,There is little or no quality control with these shirts.,"I could not recommend this product unless changes are made. I purchased several of these shirts not long ago and they were great. However, I recently purchased two and they lost at least two sizes after the first washing. The lengths were almost four inches shorter. I just wear them around the house now. The previous shirts had a label printed on the inner collar. The newer ones have a label attached to the inner collar. So, they are obviously different and probably manufactured at different locations. Not very good product quality control. I have ordered more shirts, but from a different manufacturer."
2,too small,i bought 5x's. and they fit like they are 3x's.i was very dissapointed in this tee shirt. i would not recomend them to any one
2,the brand russell has gone down hill,every piece of clothing is under going repairs from the first day. how about american made products.
4,awesome,"Not knowing what to expect from online ordering,I purchased a shirt for my boyfriend. I wasn't willing to buy as many as we needed because I couldn't experience the quality first hand. I'm pleased to share my insights, the cut was large enough and the quality is good.Thanks for your customer service."
5,perfect!,This shirt is Lightweight and comfortable! Its my new favorite shirt! Perfect as a gift or just for everyday use!
2,T-shirt shrunk after one washing,Ordered two of the XXL tall Russell t-shirts and after one wash the red one shrunk and cannot be worn again. The red one was made in Pakistan and the black one we ordered was made in China. The black one did not shrink. Would not order these again.
3,black t-shirt a little tight,"bought this shirt with a blue shirt. for some reason this shirt had a printed lable, the blue shirt had a tag. this tells me 2 different company's made these t-shirts. BTW the blue shirt fits great. had the same problem with other companies as well. seems like they give you whats left over then give you a new one"
2,Embedded word list charts don't zoom up to readable size!,"By reading the above reviews, thought this book would be great...and the content is truly valuable, but the embedded listed charts will not zoom up so you can read them. Very disappointing, because a synonym reference book with Kindle features that work would be solid gold!...I called Customer Service and talked to a very nice woman who said she would forward this glitch to publisher. Fortunately, my purchase price of $35.50 will be refunded. Can't see how an obvious error like this could be sold on Kindle web site. Who checks this before before placing on Kindle Store?"
4,A family tradition,"Every Christmas, before we opened presents, my dad would put on the Johnny Cash Christmas album. It just doesn't seem like Christmas to me until I hear his deep voice telling stories of how the holidays used to be. This newer album doesn't have all of my favorites, but it has quite a few. A must have for your Christmas album collection."
3,Re-mastered Classics of high Quality,"Fine re-masters of Leonard Berstein (on Schubert's ""Unfinished,"") and Eugene Ormandy (on most of the rest). I bought it so as to have Schubert's best works all in one place. Good enough to inspire me to purchase others in ""the greatest hits series."" Three stars"
1,not very helpful,Far too wordy;p not basic enough; ;not really for beginners. very disappointing. We still need help and realize we cannot get it from this book.
2,Not what I hoped,"Too cutesy. Wound up hiring a professional who set me up with a spreadsheet instead. I wanted some extra help with Quicken so I could get through my taxes, but this book was more about budgeting. If my business had been rental properties, it might have been more relevant to me, but it didn't address questions I had concerning my new home business."
2,For REAL dummies,"I expected much more from this book. It really explains you the most logic things which could be simply red on the menus. It do not help you with tips and tricks about how to organize your accounts (for example, cash, bank and visa, how shall they relate to each other?).Only the investment section is quite comprehensive and there are some tips for choosing one service or another.Moreover it does not cover every aspect of Quicken, but probably there is another more compete manual out there…I've used Quicken for a couple of years and if you have the same experience, I do not recommend this product."
3,I learned something about referencebooks and Kindle downloads,"I downloaded book on kindle. Very difficult to get use to. In the future, I would prefer a soft cover edition."
3,Sonia Henie -It's a Pleasure!-,I was pleased to find this old movie for my 85 yr. old mother. She was a big fan of Sonia Henie. We were alittle disappointed that it didn't show more of her skating abilities in it. It was more story than it was skating.
4,Sonja`s only Hollywood-film in color,"This is a novelty: A musical film from 1945 that contains alcoholism, poverty and adultery. Of course it`s Sonja`s show and she carries it of beautifully, though her dramatic depth as an actress might be questioned hehehe. The photography by the great Ray Rennahan is spectacular, as are the scenic design and costumes. Marie ""The Body""(as she was called) McDonald is a breathtaking witch. McDonald suffered from too many ex-husbands and eventually committed suicide by the early 60s... Sonja`s solos are the best she did on celluloid(with Iceland 1942) and her dance-scene without skates proved that she was an excellent dancer. What a pity she never was teamed with Fred Astaire; it could have been an interesting musical...."
2,Sonja in Technicolor!,This is the first Sonja Henie picture released on DVD (and her only one in Technicolor). It is not from her best period but the beautiful Technicolor and her skating and dancing scenes more than make up for it. Iris Adrian adds to the fun.
3,One of a Kind,I've been of fan of Sonja Heine since she stared making movies. Since this was her last film and the only color one that she did. I'm glad that I have it. I think that they could have had a more likeable leading man. Did not care for M.O'Shea . The rest of cast was just so so.
3,Handel's Greatest Hits,"I found this recording disappointing in many respects. The sound quality was much lower than expected, especially on track 7 ""Largo"" which on the origional, Ormandy had created such a quiet grandeur. In trach 11 ""Let the Bright Seraphim"" Wynton Marsalis overpowered the singing of Edita Gruberova, whereas the music should always be the backup of the singer, and not vice versa. I don't know what happened to the ""Hallelujah Chorus,"" but it didn't come off very well at all.CD"
5,This is a great cookbook.,"I love this cookbook, it has some wonderful recipes. I have had compliments on every recipe that I have made from this book."
4,Good perspective on the industry,"Not bad, A generalized view on the structure of aviation management. Your basic stuff, Railway Labor act,Ntsb,Warsaw pact, blah,blah,blah. Book missed out on the real issues such as fuel costs ($149 barrel of oil) overtaking labor costs and nearly bankrupting the entire system, (R.I.P. express jet,Air Italia,Frontier (hang in there) ,Northwest (now absorbed by Delta), Ahloha,ATA,Sterling,etc,etc. Book also missed out on the use of extreme cuts in operating costs and maximized load factors to counter the result of the extreme cost of fuel and a resession laden economy. generic in scope but missed all the recent fun."
4,Great stool,"I ordered 3 of these stools for our renovated kitchen breakfast bar. They are really sturdy and comfortable. The color is really nice, not a shiny silver, more like a brushed nickel. The order process was extremely easy, we had them at our house within 3 days of ordering. My husband put all 3 together in about 30 minutes. My only complaint is that 2 out of the 3 stools had uneven legs. That was very easy to fix though."
4,Very nice ice kitchen addition,"The chairs arrived very quickly and are as described. They are very sturdy and expensive looking. They were fairly easy to assemble. They look great in our new contemporary kitchen.Only complaint is that the holes at the end of the legs to accommodate the floor guards, to be screwed in, were not always consistent with the alignment. Some were perpendicular and some were slanted a little. That being said, the guards were still able to be screwed in and be generally effective."
3,Functional but not spectacular.,"I bought this chair from the Amazon Warehouse in ""like new"" condition for $43. After reading that only the outer packaging would be damaged I ordered the item. When the chair arrived (unassembled by the way) I could hear the bits and pieces rattling around in the box. After much hunting I recovered most of the hardware although it was missing 3 washers and the allen wrench. This was not a huge deal, but did require a special trip to the hardware store. If you will be spending a lot of time looking at the back of the chair, there are large welding spots where the base meets the legs. Mine had a few minor gouges in the metal, the most annoying one mid center on the top of the seat back (probably from all that hardware floating around in the box). Aside from the welding marks, I suspect if you bought this chair new you wont have the same issues. If you buy it ""like new"" however, beware of missing parts."
2,"Good art, limp story","An earlier work by Bryan Lee O'Malley (creator of Scott Pilgrim) that may appeal to those with a soft spot for morose, angst filled tales of soul searching - and while I typically do - this one falls short of delivering. The art, however, is stellar and in some ways superior to the styling of 'Scott Pilgrim.'"
4,"I alway knew you could do it, Bryan.","More than a light read, yet easier to digest than most ""truly serious"" graphic novels. The writing and art is tastey for the eyes and mind alike. The man can control a brush and ink better than most others. This is a fine read for most any day, I read it in one sitting and felt very pleased to read a book that I had long awaited. Thank You, Bryan. Keep working hard. Keep telling stories."
3,"Good Book, but no Scott Pilgrim","To avoid rambling, I'll give you the bottom line first: Don't buy it unless you REALLY want it, and don't expect it to fill up a weekend of time.My first experience with Bryan Lee O'Malley's works started with Scott Pilgrim the movie and lead to the graphic novels. I was stunned and impressed.Lost At Sea, was by all means a good buy. I think I got it for about twelve dollars at the time.However, when taking a literary standpoint, you need to be in the right mood to read it. Granted, it takes less than an hour to completely read through it, it contained some abstracts that (although beautiful) could have agitated the reader. It was quick, it was good, it was mind-opening.Then again, the ""quick"" part could be seen as bad, and it was also a simple kind of abstract.I don't want to analyse this book and its creativity, but I can see that some people may love it and some people may be disappointed."
5,dont overlook this book,"i recently purchasedLost At Seafor the purpose of giving it to my girlfriend, who is a fan of the scott pilgrim series. before wrapping it i figured i would take a look, and even though i cant relate with all of the main characters' problems (the main character being a girl) i did find that the book was rather good, i could understand the girls emotions and situation, and by the end of the book it had properly reeled me in. if this werent a stand-alone book i would be dreaming of a sequel right now. i am definitely going to buy another copy for myself when i get the chance.Do not pass up the opportunity to buy this :3"
3,A Bit Depressing,"The title tells all really. This book is the story of a lonely girl who can't grasp reality. It picks up towards the end, but was not as satisfying as you would think. A nice grab for the price, but there are a lot better books around."
4,Good but not great,"I am probably the hugest Scott Pilgrim graphic novel fan ever so when I bought Lost at Sea, I was expecting to be blown away but I was just left confused. I actually had to go to Wikipedia to find out what was happening. It's an ok read but kind a slow and weird and confusing. Recommended buy for Bryan Lee O'Malley fans."
4,Nice read.,"It has the quirky humour that made the Scott pilgrim series great - but don't expect fighting, video game references etc. It is a different book with a totally different story. That said, its a great book."
5,Nice supplement...,"I am taking a federal income tax course that uses a textbook which consists mainly of court cases.. and written in hard-to-understand ""judicial language"". We discuss the cases and go over the problem-solving questions at such a fast pace that sometimes I just blindly jot down notes and try to make sense of them afterwards.This is where the supplementary comes in. The glossary neatly lists the various topics. There are introductions to the important code sections, followed by sample questions and detailed explanations. It helped me understand the more difficult concepts (which wasn't difficult at all) such as 1245/1250 recapture, disaster gain/loss, depreciation, and other calculations. While it does not include most of the court cases from my main textbook, some of the major cases are briefly discussed throughout.This book is no substitute for class attendance, but it did make studying run smoothly during exam week."
3,Tax,"This book is helpful in regards to giving you a general overview of the material. However, I purchased this book to better understand annuities, discharge of indebtedness and section 1031 of the tax code. These were the topics that the authors did a horrible job of explaining. Unfortunately, these topics are very important. I have only read up to the start of chapter 3 in this book and I am worried that further reading will only further confuse me.I must say, this book is better than nothing, but I wish it was better."
3,"Good record, bad recording",Loved the music but realized when he made this it was a poor recording. Still happy to have a copy though.
5,Captain Fantastic is quintesential Elton,"When I think of Elton John music, Captain Fantastic is always one of the first albums that comes to mind. This is not the album to start with if you only want the hits. But if what you want is the quintesential, autobiographical work of Elton and lyricist Bernie Taupin, then this is where you will want to start. The only ""hit"" on the album is ""Someone Saved My Wife Tonight"", but this album is not about singles. This album is meant to be heard, and savoured from beginning to end without interuption. It is original and brilliant."
3,Elton and Bernie join The Partridge Family,"Elton John / Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy: There are several radio friendly tunes here, all sounding like they came from The Partridge Family, or a concert from `Up with People'. If this is a concept album, nobody realized it until decades later when they proclaimed they were making a sequel to it. Elton and Bernie took all the Wrong lessons away from their ""Yellow Brick Road"" masterpiece and became `hit' makers instead of album makers. This CD can serve as a collection of Elton John's mid `70s radio hits, but that all it's worth (and we still get this stuff over the radio anyway). This marked the death of Elton John as an artist. I'll be generous and give this one Three Stars."
3,OK,"Let's not get carried away here...there are some good songs on this record, but several turkeys as well. Someone Saved My Life Tonight, Bitter Fingers, Better Off Dead, and the title track are among his best. Tell Me When The Whistle Blows and Writing are lousy. An uneven effort that rates no more than three stars."
3,IT IS NOT GYBR!,"Slow down guys! Just because the name of this album is Captain Fantastic doesn't mean it is so great. I would give it 3 and 1/2 stars. On this album there isn't good songs like Philadelphia Freedom or Pinball Wizard which are also from 1975. Title song is boring,Tell Me When The Whistle Blows and Writing are also not very good songs. The best songs are SSMLT,Tower Of Babel,Better Off Dead and We All Fall In Love Sometimes and other songs are ok. I am a big Elton's fan and I was listening this album thousand times and I think that GYBR and Dont Shoot Me are much more better than this. But don't get me wrong,this is more than good album!"
2,lullabyes to paralize,"If it werent for the 3 add on songs it would be 1 star, nice to sleep to though"
2,"Not so Fantastic, Captain","I should first state that I am a huge EJ fan. His music has been extremely important to me over the years. He is, without a doubt, a genius ... I would go so far as to call him the Mozart of our times.But, Elton can also write bloated, self-indulgent tripe, and if you ask me, this album belongs in that bucket. I give it 2 stars just because of SSMLT, one of his all-time greats. I never cease to be blown away by that song. But the rest of this album? Booooooring!!!!"
5,top 20 all time live album,this Elton John live is a top 20 all time live album for me. What a gem. If you don't have this you are missing something.
5,Essential Early Elton,"This is the early stuff when Elton and Bernie were young, earnest, and hungry. Prior to the formation of the Elton John Band, performers include Davey and Nigel among others.The songs are very melodic with pleasant poetic lyrics whether for beautiful ballads like The Greatest Discovery or the rocking Take Me to the Pilot. This album is best known for the enduring hit, Your Song.Of the early Elton works, this and Honky Chateau are must-haves."
5,"elton john, by elton john",This was the album that opened up to the american listener. I acually sat down and listen to whole album for the first time. I was very surprized how good this album really was. The best was yet to come through his later album releases. I recommend this album as a good starter for the Elton John collection. Thank you Amazon.
4,Great Album - Underrated..,"First, I consider this Elton's 1st real album.This one, and the next few that followed (Madman, Tumbleweed, Honky Chataeu,) are, IMHO, all masterpieces.Of course, ""Your Song"" is a classic love song, and the one that everyone remembers from this album. But other classics like ""Take Me To The Pilot"", ""Sixty Years On"", ""I Need You To Turn To"", and especially, ""The King Must Die (an absolute masterpiece based on Sir James Frazier's, the Golden Bow)"" PLUS the CD bonus track, ""Bad Size Of The Moon"" make this CD a must have.......For the youngsters out there: Elton John was a great songwriter, muscian, and performer before he decided to put on a duck suit and sing about Rockin' Crocodiles. If that's all you know about him, you owe it to yourself to buy this CD!"
5,His best work ever.,"This is the first album I was ever given, I received it as a christmas gift along with my first stereo. I recently added it to my CD collection and had forgotten how amazing this collection of songs is, this version is even more amazing due to the sound quality. It is for the most part dark and melancholy but has its bright spots and all of the songs are a necessary part of the whole. This is an epic album and I believe essential for any classic rock collection. I believe this is his best work to date."
4,How to integrate Gospel spirituality with Liturgy?,"I received a copy of this book as a Christmas gift from the archbishop and at the next opportunity I thanked him in person. He encouraged me again to read it, saying, ""The chapter on preaching is particularly inspiring."" In order to fulfil my promise to him I sat down with the book. In spite of the short sentences, small paragraphs and the everyday language, it was not that easy a reading.The book successfully brings out the need for our spirituality to be nourished and sustained regularly by the celebration of the Liturgy. One needs to be present at the Eucharist with one's receptivity and in touch with one's own brokenness. Liturgy is a golden event in which imagination has to play a vital role but the experience of the believer is indeed real. This book is helpful to the faithful to internalize the Gospel spirituality celebrated in the Eucharist. It would provide assistance to the presider-homilist as well as to the men and women in the pew."
3,its nice but not what i thought it was.,"the set consists of 4 dvds exploring different topics as desribed in the product desription. if you're looking for dull endless segments showing you how to make your own bouquets, etc. then you found the dvd for you. i thought it was like a group of segments showing finished products in different categories like romantic looks, bohemian lookes, day/night looks for cakes, flowers, decor, table settings. i was wrong. it was a tutorial on how to make these things. its basicaly a collection of all her martha stewart living episodes on weddings."
4,Fun to watch and learn,Unleash your inner-bride! This DVD set teaches you a lot about weddings and some practical advice for hosting any sort of party. Great sections on flowers and decorating your party space.You won't be able to DIY your ceremony and reception after watching these but I think it's important to know the lingo your vendors will use to make sure you are clear on what you want.
5,Second Generation,"I hadn't realized just how much I had worn out this delightful, Pete Seegerish banjo manual until my daughter wanted to take up the instrument. We dug out my 1962 red-covered edition and between the stains, rips and tatters, I saw all the things that made me love it way back when. It's probably not the perfect way to learn for absolutely everyone, as Pete himself would certainly agree, but it is the perfect way to learn the banjo while being warmed by the insight and soul of this wonderful American."
2,Claw Hammer Banjo Book,There wasn't any way I could tell when I ordered this book that it was written for C tuning banjo. I was interested to learn with G tuning. The book was helpful but not what I was looking for.
3,New Banjo Player,The book was OK but I guess I exspected something a little moreeasy for this old man to understand. I probably won't use it much but there are a few things I understand
2,The tab is tiny,"The tablature in this book is so small, and is crammed beside notes and narrative. It's a good read, yes, but it's just hard to read the tab."
3,Helpful but odd.,"The good:I have flipped through the whole book and read the first parts of it, and I have already learned a lot. This book is very useful for learning basic things such as strumming, rolls, etc. It's got a nice little dose of history mixed in which allows the reader to delve into the world of the banjo rather than just music itself.The bad:My 5-string banjo came with instructions for tuning it to GBGBD, and that is how I began to learn it. That is also how most of the internet thinks it should be tuned. This banjo book talks about tuning it to GCGBD. This means that the chords in the back index do not match GBGBD tuning and are, for that tuning, useless. I have been able, however, to learn the songs in the book by looking up the chords elsewhere and by adjusting the tabs to match my banjo's tuning. If I had this purchase to do over, I'd select a different book due to this, but it has certainly been a learning experience."
2,What a rip off!,"I got the Game and played it, I was having so much fun until it came to level 10 and said it was a DEMO!. I was screaming, they never told me it was a Demo. I think they were untrustworty if i were you i wouldn't buy from these people!"
3,Boulez conducts Stravinsky,"You know this is something to debate about.A lot of things here are in question.Boulez is a great conductor,but he does not seems to be the right conductor for Stravinsky.For once his tempo in ""The Rite of Spring"",for example the percussion section is not loud enough,at times it does not sounds to be a really loud work.In ""Petroushka"" Boulez does not puts the enthusiasm and grace that the performance of this work would required."
4,photo explosion,"It was very dificult to use at first, I still haven't gotten to use all of its features, however for a quick banner or stanionary, or a quick photo edit, this software is excellent, I use Adobe photoshop at school, and this program gives me the oppurtunity to open a photoshop file on my computer"
2,VERY difficult to use,"I got this for Christmas and I can't say that I'm impressed. It's very difficult to navigate and it's my experience that it doesn't do everything it says it does. I wanted Photoshop Elements 4.0 and I can zip around that in no time flat but this one has me flustered. You can't resize photos to an exact measurement such as 4x4 inches like you can in PSE, you have to eyeball it which is REALLY difficult. You also can't manually manipulate the colors and effects like you do is PSE. I'm very disappointed in this software. I don't recommend it to ANYONE!"
5,Fun for the whole Family,This software has done everything I have ever asked of it. It is powerful and easy to use. The slide shows it produces are always a big hit. I have enjoyed using this so much I got my mother in law one for her birthday.
1,cheap hangars-you get what you pay for,"There is no soft shoulder padding on this product-the only goal I had in ordering them. If it wasnt' a hassle to return them, I would. However, they came w/other items in a large box. Its not worth the cost of shipping them back. If there was an option for ""no"" stars, I would have checked that. BTW, this is the first time I've written a review in the many years I've been ordering from Amazon. The product description is misleading-but shame on me for thinking it would be acceptable given the $."
5,Hard to find satin hangers,"I have been looking for these hangers for my winter sweaters, I even looked at the leading bed and linen stores. I ordered these satin hangers which are well made and are perfect for my sweaters."
2,Broke after a couple months,I purchased this multi pack to include with some gifts of garment bags which I made for friends. I also made one for myself and used one of the hangers. After only a couple of months of infrequent use the top disconnected from the base. My clothes fell down when I wasn't aware and luckily they were in a garment bag. I am embarrassed that I have used these in gifts because I wouldn't be surprised if others had the same problem. Not a quality product. I would not recommend.
4,"Nice hangers, could be a bit wider",Overall I'm pretty happy with the hangers. I took off one star because they are a bit too short for wider neck style tops. An extra inch or two on each side would go a long way.
4,padded hangers,"Good quality product -- my second order. These are hard to find in stores now, but they are still needed for sweaters, etc."
4,JOHN WAYNE -JOHN FORD COLLECTION FILMS,"This was packaged well an the movies are in great shape, with good sound and color. The pricing was the same as the stores however. The mailing was recieved in 6 days after ordering..in November. Will use AMAZON.COM AGAIN!!"
5,John Wayne-John Ford Film Collection,I purchased this for a John Wayne-John Ford fan and they were delighted with all the movies in the set. Purchasing was easy and delivery was fast.
4,Great gift,This item was purchased for my husband for Christmas. He is a huge John Wayne fan. He was so excited about all the movies and the special photos that came with the collection.
1,Very old films,"I was very excited to purchase this box set for my dad who's a huge John Wayne fan. Unfortunately, all the movies were black and while, they were the really old John Wayne stuff! So if you want something in color or recent John Wayne stuff, this is not for you."
1,Very vicious films! Outdated and racial by the white!!,"Technically, John Ford was one of the greatest film makers. With the racist, John Wayne, he made many vicious films(more precisely, films by the view point of the winner based on racism). Moreover, I prefer Henry Fonda to John Wayne for John Ford films because Henry Fonda was a fine actor, and John Wayne never showed good performance(Probably he could shout). If you like the westerns, see 'McCabe and Mrs Miller' directed by the late Altman. I don't want to see John Wayne on the film media any more for a better society."
5,Warhorses,Very nicely bundled selection of the Duke's movies. We enjoyed watching them as we stayed at Gouldings at Monument Valley.
1,Didn't do anything for me!,We got the CD because of the low price and we wanted something different but I found the CD to be annoying it just grated on my nerves so I grabbed it out of the CD changer and put another Christmas CD in!
1,1000 hours of slap-fights,"I'm a huge MMA fan, and not at all opposed to watching regional shows with crappy production values. I have dozens of such events on DVD. However, this was absolutely unwatchable for me. The reason being that the rules of this promotion (or perhaps the state) did not allow any strikes to the head except with an open fist (no kicks, fists, forearms, elbows etc.). Couple that with the fact that the vast majority of the fighters had very limited technical skills (I believe most of them were legitimate amateurs). I tried to hang in there and at least finish one full event, but that proved quite arduous (I scanned through all five events just to see if it was all open-fist strikes only - it was). It's pretty deflating to see somebody get a full mount, but not be able to do anything with it because they couldn't apply any ground and pound and had no submission skills. Basically what you have here is a DVD set with many, many hours of slap-fighting and bad submission grappling."
2,"Disbelief, shoddy product","The fighters get poor introductions as the fights just happen, you can't see their faces that well, and the fights mostly are on the ground (wrestling). It's not worth it. Don't waste your money and time."
4,The Ultimate BS&T Collection,"If your appreciation for Blood Sweat & Tears goes beyond just the ""hits,"" then this is the set for you. In addition to the full-length (not edited for radio) versions of such B.S.& T. classics as ""Spinning Wheel,"" ""Hi-De-Ho"" and ""Lucretia McEvil,"" this collection contains the essential tracks that defined their unique mixture of sounds. From jazz-heavy gems like ""Smiling Phases,"" and ""Something's Comin' On,"" to Rockin' cuts like ""Go Down Gamblin'"" and ""More & More,"" Blood Sweat & Tears versatility remains truly refreshing. Al Kooper's pre David Clayton Thomas contribution particulary on ""I Can't Quit Her,"" and ""I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know,"" make this a true retrospective. Unfortunately, both discs are not created equal. The second disc is a little thin featuring many cuts between David Clayton Thomas' two stints with the group. However as a total package, this is a must for serious Blood Sweat & Tears fans."
5,"A Definitive Blood, Sweat & Tears collection disc!","Only one thing that tells the entire historical B,S&T legacy story is ""What Goes Up! The Best of"". Because back in the mid sixties it was canadian singer David Clayton Thomas who was as second lead vocalist of the jazzy, blues & rock'n roll band ever to profile. The songs I like and enjoy listening to is ""You've Made Me So Very Happy"", ""And When I Die"", Spinning Wheel"", ""God Bless The Child"" and ""Hi-De-Ho"" those are my favorite tunes I remembered from the radio!"
3,Rather confused and incoherent,"The purpose of this book is to attempt a defense of the naturalist point of view (that nothing outside nature exists), and yet still argue for the value of religion. It is an ambitious task, but sadly the author was not up to it.The book has some value as a source for recent material on the subject, but I was disappointed in the authors apparent inability to summarise the views of other authors in any coherent way or to present his own views intelligibly.The only section which I thought reasonably well handled was the historical study of the conflicts between science and Christianity."
3,According to Speilman (1988) this is one of two bits in a set,"There are two bits in the moulding cutter system that comes with instructions for making 52 different profiles some of which are shown on page 52 of Spielman's ""Router Jigs and Techniques"" 1988, Sterling Publishing Co.,Inc. New YorkFurnima who made the 2 bit set has gone out of business. Alternates is this one bit and looking around to find something that will make the profiles of the second bit which looks alot like the moulding head cutters found for the Sears craftsman table saw. The possibilities should more than satisfy the avid picture frame maker. Jim"
5,Ridiculous comments!,"I can't help but commenting on the review featured below posted by: Vyto Stoskus ""Bookroom regarding the film `A very long engagement'. I respect the fact that the film is not everybody's cup of tea (I personally think it's a masterpiece) in the end, it's all a matter of tastes. But suggesting the French people stick to making comedy because (apparently) it's what they do best is the most ridiculous comment I have ever heard. Some people sadly (and it's a shame) don't much about French cinema!"
2,A Very Long Movie,"People who think elevator music is Mozart will probably like this movie because it has subtitles and is slow. A story which should have been great... but feels, instead, interminably long. Tarkovsky and Leone can get away with lethargic pacing because they are true cinematic artists. Jeunet, unfortunately, isn't, and this movie comes off as a lethargic `Amelie Goes to War'.Gorgeous cinematography... but the Italian hooker angel-of-death was a much more interesting character than the one Ms. Tatou, unfortunately, portrayed. They made a movie about the wrong person!Historical note: This film won the Palm d' Bore at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival."
2,Could have been a GREAT movie but it had many flaws,"Hopefully will be corrected and re-released. Problems as follows- 1. was not dubbed in english. It was very hard to follow with the English subtitles. Sometimes they weren't up long enough to read other times, they were white over a white of yellow back ground of the video and they couldn't be seen to read. 2. Jumped around in time and between to many characters. 3. Was a little long. I hope these problems are corrected and the movie would be a great film. If you read French it would be good like it is."
3,Why Not in English?,"Producers: Please re-release it in English! A very good movie with a nice ending. Although well done, it is distressing for the viewer to have to read the subtitles across a rather wide blackboard as the lush action moves along. Despite that flaw, you will enjoy the intricate plot and the realistic battle scenes."
5,The best foreign movie I have ever seen,"The Very Long Engagement is a brilliant French film with a masterfully constructed narrative. It is superbly acted with picturesque cinema photography. This movie constantly delivers surprises, and is an exceptionally pleasing work by Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet.Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author"
3,Couldn't enjoy because you have to read the lines...,"Beautiful Paris and the French country side in the 1920's, this would be a good movie to watch except that you can't watch it because you have to read the lines."
3,"I liked it, but not THAT much...","I'm usually a sap for good love stories, but this one didn't have what I am normally into. Perhaps it was the somewhat foreign nature of the film that did not appeal to me or perhaps the story line felt a little choppy at times but I could not connect to the story the way I wanted to. I tried, but the movie was just shy of 4 stars."
3,"Beautiful, but ...","We enjoyed the war sequences best, as another reviewer mentioned. It's visually beautiful cinematography. The flashbacks to the war were very compelling. The love story with Tautou, less so - although the gentleman who played Manech gave an incredible performance. Tautou's performance was too coy. The unraveling of the mystery was ridiculous on-film. Her cottage was gorgeous to look at, as was most of the countryside. I read the book, and the mystery also didn't read well and was hard to follow. The film's ending was quite artistic, but also quite disappointing in the way it was wrought."
3,Veryyyyy longg and slow movie,"It's not bad because of the excelent acting of Audrie Tatou, photography is excelent but the story by itself is kind of slow and boring.I really was expecting something heart-touching."
5,Beautifull in it's simplicity and the depiction of human stupidity,"I loved the book and enjoyed the movie so much, it become a classic in my DVD collection. I brought 4 copies that I loaned to everybody around me! People in the US do not realize how tragic WW1 was and what was the price the french people had to pay for their freedom. I regret that this movie was not translated in english to give him a wider audience,"
4,Young but neverending love ...,"This is a wonderful movie about a young couple in love when the WW I ""comes between"" them. Separated by the war, Maneche is supposed to be amoung the fallen, but Mathilde is sure that ""her love"" is still alive and that she will find him.There begins the great search for him... Will she find him ???A typical FRENCH movie. And leaving it in the original language makes it so much better...Highly recommended !!!"
1,this is not old Zach De LaRocha stuff,if your looking for old Zach de la rocha stuff this is not it dont even bother
3,inside out -outside in,I bought the original ep inside out which is a very heavy straight edge punk metal sounding ep. Lead singer from that ep went on to be lead singer for rage against the machine. Point I'm getting to hear is the original inside out was heavy. This album is a light jazz album and on the complete other end of the music spectrum. I like all kids of music and I really like both inside out bands for what they are. This album is the kind of thing you would hear on smooth jazz stations.
4,Great Garlic Flavor,"This product gives a nice garlic flavor to my garlic bread. Of course, it could never take the place of garlic but it is a more pure taste than garlic powder. I use it on other dishes as well."
4,Good Value,The beauty of the Closed Sicilian is that someone with only a little knowledge can play the opening with confidence. Lane presents lots of annotated games to explain how and why White should develop his pieces. The emphasis is on creating a plan which means there is no need to learn a maze of variations. It certainly works because in my own games I have played in the same style of Spassky thanks to the author's clear explanation. I already own several of Lane's books and this is one of the best.
2,Remixes Galore,I was pretty disappointed with this c.d. because I bought it hoping to find the original version of Catch Me I'm Falling. This c.d. single sports nothing more than a bunch of overdone re-mixes. You will find nothing close to the original version of the song here. I don't have speakers on my computer so I couldn't listen to it online before buying.
4,cool ideas about an item...!!,this cd has awesome rhytms and beats!also there are variations of the songs and great remixes!check this disc out!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Wrong version,My wife was expecting a different version of this song. This was the enhanced version. She wanted the original.
4,slumberjack sleeping pad,"This is my second slumberjack sleeping pad. these are great entry level, intermediate sleeping pads. They are very durable and overall dont weigh too much for their size. These pads not only give comfort from hard ground, they insulate you from the cold. These are great pads for the $$$"
4,great,"Fits perfectly,good fabric,washes well. downside ,it wrinkles in dryer,so needs to be airdried to avoid wrinkles.Upside ,my daughter doesn't care ,she loves it."
5,Don't miss this gem!,"This is one of the best books I've ever read! Tim Wesemann has a unique writing style that helps me to apply spiritual truths into my daily life. His words touch me deeply because of his refreshing honesty and need for God in his life. He also desires a deeper relationship with Jesus as his Savior and his love for Jesus is shared authentically through the writings of this book. Jesus' story is one worth telling and these words do so in a powerful way. I'd highly recommend it to Max Lucado, John Ortberg, and Walt Wangerin (""Ragman"") fans. I doubt you'd be disappointed. Buy two ... one to keep and return to again and again. Enrich someone's spiritual life and give the other away. Check out his website at ...and find out what Rene Gutteridge, Karen Kingsbury, Gayle Roper, and James Scott Bell say about it, too!"
5,Kindle Bonus,"The Kindle edition by Penguin Classics (ASIN: B002RI9YOQ) also contains the novels ""The Pursuit of Love"" and ""The Blessing"""
2,Disappoinment,"Being a big Mitford fan, I assumed that this book would by in the same class as the others. It is not andI did not even finish reading it. Pretentious and dated"
5,Surprise and Delight,"Imagine my surprise and delight to find another book by Heider, just as wonderful as his Tao of Leadership. The work provides application of Taoist principles to real world, daily experiences. Love the artwork, love the concepts.Thanks for a new view, Heider!"
4,Insightful!,"Jack Beatty combines his own analyses with writers' essays, articles and other materials to chronicle the American corporation from its inception in the 1600s through the present. His overall conclusion seems to be that corporations are a source of more evil than good, but don't let this bias throw you - this collection of sometimes brilliant writings is captivating reading. We from getAbstract highly recommend this book to all students of business history, especially those whose views of the corporate colossus tend toward the darker side."
4,A psycho-sexual excursion,"This one stayed with me for a long time after I had finished it. An all cards on the table narration of an intelligent woman who gets close, too close, to the man she suspects of killing her sister. The most fasinating part of the book was to see Nora slowly being drawn into this man's dark and perverse world. It is a very erotic and troubling journey to behold."
5,Absolutely a must-read book.,"Topping from Below holds your attention from the very first page. Once you start reading, you can't put it down. It's full of mystery, romance, suspense and creates truly erotic scenes that are so descriptive you feel that you are there. Never have I read a book so entertaining. Truly a must-read book"
4,"Psychological ""whodunnit"" blending Poe with Nabokov","This is a surprisingly poignant ""whodunnit"" that blends theslippery darkness of Poe's ""The Raven"" with an edge out ofNabokov's ""Lolita."" Ignore the blurb on the cover - this isNOT ""The Story of O"" for the 1990s. It is, however, very wellobserved and quite compelling. Reese plays with her readers'expectations, and while the book has several technical flaws,they detract only a little from the careful pace and tensionshe achieves. Not erotic at all, but haunting and sad."
4,S&M Classic,"Despite a bit of clunkiness in the plotting, and too many pages to get where it's going, Topping From Below is an S&M classic. It's strong stuff, not ordinary fare. ""M"", the sadistic master, may well have killed the heroine's too-submissive little sister. To find out the truth, the heroine will have to play his game. It's a game she is reluctant to be drawn into...at first...but she becomes caught in the master's web. There are powerful and graphic scenes here, turn-ons as well as turn-offs, as the game is played to its deadly conclusion. Unforgettable. If you think you should read one S&M novel in your lifetime, this should be the one you pick. But, be warned, it will stay with you. Not surprising it has achieved such a large, intense cult following."
3,good quick read,"Suspense was well-done. I can't say whether the actual S&M depictions were accurate but they were certainly evocative. As someone who has never participated in such acts, Reese did a very good job of depicting the emotions and the rationalizations of being in those situations. Otherwise, the writing became dull sometimes and sometimes I wasn't sure if I was reading a Sidney Sheldon novel or not. However, I did finish it so it was captivating on an entertainment level."
2,dejavu anyone?,"Did anyone get the sense that this was Panic Snap? I think Laura reese has only written two books and they both has similar plots. I would suggest reading one or the other but not both.1. Black car trying to run over the girl. (both books)2. Woman trying to find out info from the guy (both books)3. One had a lamb the other had piglets...Come on Laura, try to separate the books a bit. I felt like I was reading two drafts of the same book."
3,I got this mainly because I am familiar with the geography,"This story takes place in Davis, CA where my son lived for many years. It was fun to hear the familiar sounding streets, etc. But the plot had many holes such as the ending. I won't say what it was, but it was implausible. I enjoyed the writer going into the head of the younger sister as I was a child therapist during my career. I can see why she did what she did, but have no earthly idea why the older sister would do what she did."
2,Interesting,Interesting book but couldn't get through the whole thing.. 50 shades is much better then this. not even sure if i will go back and finish it
5,Topping From Below,I was looking for an erotic novel to read that I could introduce to my book club. Topping From Below is great because it is a combination of erotica with a very strong story line. From the moment I picked up the book I literally did not want to put it down! This is a great read and a great selection for book club conversation. I believe that adding this book to kindle or another E-Reader would increase the sales.
4,I FELT A PERVERSE ADDICTION FROM THE VERY FIRST PAGE.,"NOT SINCE DEAN KOONTZS',"" THE BAD PLACE"", HAVE I BEEN SO PHYSICALLY DRAWN TO A NOVEL. THE COVER IS MISLEADING, AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN LENT TO ME, I WOULD NOT HAVE PICKED IT UP. I'M GLAD I DID AND THOROUGHLY AGREE WITH PLAYBOY'S REVIEW. ""A GOOD WHO DUNNIT MIXED WITH RAUNCHY SEX."""
2,"thriller, yes; erotic, no","As a psychological thriller, this book would get 5 stars. It has a great plot, lots of twists and suspense, and the characters were well developed. I really felt Franny's pain. As an erotic novel, I would give it 1 star. Now, i'm no prude, I like a good spanking scene as much as the next girl, but parts of this book made me want to vomit. If bestiality (sp?) is your thing, read it, if not you may want to stay clear. So depending on what you are looking for, you may enjoy it, but it was a bit too hardcore for my tastes."
1,SICK is an understatement,"This book is just plain sick. I asked myself what kind of sick, twisted person writes this kind of story. Here's what you can expect:urinating on people to show possession and dominance, intimate acts with animals, sex with animals, electroshock, cutting, severing limbs, etc. Disgusting and sick!! This book should not even be allowed to be included in the genre. Abuse, degrading of women, murder,etc. I had nightmares after reading this. I will never pick up another book from this author."
3,Verbose,"I really enjoyed this book. The author carried on though, I got a bit tired of reading about what everyone was wearing, in most every scene, from head to toe. A bit verbose for my taste but beyond that, excellant read."
3,"Not bad, but predictable and slow in places","The story line was great. But I didn't like the ending. The suspense was well done. She spends a bit too much time detailing some things that seem to have little weight in the story, at times. But overall it was a fun read, with skips every once in awhile to get past the intense detailing."
5,Unusual and interesting mix of genres,"Laura Reese's ""Topping from Below"" is an interesting mix of mystery writing and BDSM fiction. Although some mystery novels occasionally throw in a little kink for interests sake (for example, ""Kiss the Girls"") and some BDSM novels maintain some elements of mystery, Topping from Below actually succeeds as both.Successful and attractive Nora Tibbs is shocked to discover that her shy, vulnerable sister was carrying on a sadomasochistic affair with a mysterious professor before she was killed. Determined to bring the monster that murdered her sister to justice, Nora descends into his world of domination and submission, first to seduce him and then betray him to the law.Well written, with interesting characters, numerous plot turns and sensual dialog, this book is sure to interest anyone attracted to the darker side of sex."
2,Very creepy,Little too much for me. Don't care for some of the sex scenes little to weird and creepy. But had and unexpected ending.
1,wasted,"Not one part turned me on, story was slow and dragged on for too long to get interesting, nothing exciting about the characters, the writer clearly does not know what erotic means."
1,Terrible!!,A slow and predictable plot littered with raunchy side scenes. The characters are one-deminsional and frustrating. No literary worth other than cheap shock value. I generally pass a book on to friends after reading but after finishing this one it easily found its permanent home in my trash
1,Flat and constructed,"Unfortunately, this book is totally predictable, and filled with flat characters and cliches. A book this explicit needs to contain better writing to differentiate itself from run-of-the-mill pornography."
2,Um... you have to be kidding me... right?,"First off, I can't really go into detail on just why I didn't like the book without giving things away to those who haven't read it yet. I will say that some of the scenes were captivating, and I did enjoy reading most of the novel. But by the time I got to the end I was thoroughly disgusted (and it wasn't the S&M). It was the way the book played off stereotypes and the predictable nature of the plot. Basically, it makes a good stroke book if you're into that sort of thing, but it isn't a great mystery novel."
2,Boring....,"As far as erotica goes... this book was between a ""G"" & ""PG-13"" rating. Definitely boring and does not deliver the story the preview promises. I don't recommend wasting money or time on this one."
1,Very Gross book,"I didn't even know things like this went on. It totally grossed me out.How could anyone with an ounce of self esteem allow ""M"" to do those things to her. And Nora seemed like a strong, well adjusted heroine, but her decline into S & M, was totally unrealistic to me. The book did keep you guessing however as to who committed the crime, but this book is too ""hardcore"" for my tastes."
5,Great product!,"Came on time, Exactly what i have expected from the product, and a realy good price, with short supply time. Thanks!"
4,"It works, nothing more",This thing does exactly what u want it to. The term spinning would be a bit generous though. Spins less with more frequesnt use and more weight on the rack. Does what i bought it for. i didnt buy it because it spins fast or smooth. It dries the many bottles i put on it everyday.
4,Works well for our Dr Browns bottles,"I chose this rack over the one made especially for Dr Brown's bottles given the reviews. Overall, it works really great. The bottom vertical rods hold bottles and we stack the blue vent tubes which are part of the Dr Brown bottles and nipples on the smaller top rods. Most of the other parts we just pile up on top.The two things I would like to see different are:1. More vertical rods on top since the tube and nipple stacking looks messy.2. Stronger rods on the bottom as we have a couple glass Dr Browns bottles and they bend the rods a bit and I'm always worried they may break, though they haven't so far."
4,Very practical and necessary,"If you don't have glass bottles, this product is a must-have in the house. It saves space, it is light, has enough spaces for bottles, it is GREAT!I recommend it! It is very reasonably prices, also."
4,works well,easy assembly and good for drying bottles. serves the purpose for the cost paid. The plate underneath it to catch the dripping water is a good idea.
2,Not that great,It does not rotate freely and its a pain putting it together and taking it apart. Does not store away easily. Ended up putting all the sticks & pieces into ziploc bags.
5,Simply the best!,"ALL bottles, nipples, containers, jars, teethers, small toys fit in this. Does not take much space."
3,bottle rack,if you have plenty of counter space this is a great product. it is really large but is effective.
1,Flimsy - collapsed with glass bottles,"This thing is cheap and flimsy. The picture looked better, but I was disappointed when I put it together. It held up moderately for a couple of months. Now the top part won't stay in place. Despite it falling apart on us, I just haven't found it very easy to use. all the small parts wind up in the middle where it is harder to get to them. Of course, we use glass bottles so there is more weight on the parts than if we used plastic, but the top part is where we put the bottle tops, nipples, etc. That shouldn't break it. Oh well, I am online shopping for a replacement now. This one just didn't hold up for us."
1,"Falls apart, only had it for about 1 year.","Falls apart to easily, the upper rack doesn't stay put anymore and it can't function properly unless it does stay put. If the rack can not stay put it doesn't serve a purpose, so I'm giving it one star because of this. Seems harsh, but we've had it for a year."
3,Moms with infants need a drying rack for sure,"I bought this item before my baby was born, bought this along with baby bottles and microwave sterilizer. This rack is not at all sturdy and forget about the spinning part. But I use this everyday either after cleaning my bottles with soap and water or after sterilizing. I don't have any other dryig racks to compare to. This is a useful product but needs improvement. I use BPA free plastic bottles, so this rack holds them. This product is definitely not for glass bottles. Rack can hold up to 2 8 ounce bottles with their parts, two sets of breast pump parts along with breast pump bottles."
4,A good product,"It's a very good product and the only reason why I gave 4 starts is due to the bottom rack is not revolving (kind of stuck after 3 days, don't know if I set it up wrong). Otherwise, absolutely useful and serves the purpose."
4,pleased with purchase,"I can fit Ameda purely pump parts, 5 ameda 4 oz bottles& caps\lids, and 4 of Dr Brown's 8oz wide neck bottles and parts plus a few pacifiers and it can still spin fine. I previously had a munchkin drying rack which I did like seemed a little more sturdy, but it jist didn't hold enough. Pleased with purchase!"
5,Love this!,"We use Dr. Brown's and Medela plastic bottles. This rack is perfect for all the pieces, plus breast pump parts. We have a very small kitchen with limited counter and cabinet space. This is a great size, and two shelves mean we can dry/store more. I like being able to spin it around to the piece I need, too. Attractive pricing is a huge plus, and since it works so well we are very happy with our purchase."
3,definite pluses and minuses,Plus side - 2 levels and lots of space to store a variety of items.Minuses - the little sticks that are used to hold the bottles and other items are flimsy and aren't tightly locked into the rack so my bottles are constantly falling down.
3,Jasmine,It's overall pretty good! Except my bottles are glass ones. After about 2 months those plastic sticks became bended and they can't be straightened up. And 8 oz bottles can't stand up in the container.
2,Do not buy if you have glass bottles,"It is a great space saving design, but as noted by other reviewers, does NOT work with glass bottles. It's very cheap flimsy plastic. The polls on the bottom layer started to bend over with the glass bottles, and what is worst, after 1 day of usage the top rack collapsed to the bottom because I was using glass bottles (and not all the prongs were even used). I ended up getting the Skip Hop Drying Rack, and it is working very well for me. I only wish they could make a STRONG two tier design one day."
3,Just not right for me.....,"Bought this because it looks like it takes up less counter space than a rectangular rack and because of the so called spin feature. As another reviewer said, it is bulky, stands very tall and is extremely hard to spin. You'd think you could spin it with one hand, but the bottom part you can't. You have to hold it with one hand and then spin, otherwise it will fall down. I had planned on just leaving it on the counter so the fact that it doesn't fold up very well, didn't bother me too much. Pretty much to ""fold it"" you take it completely apart and it looks exactly how it did when you pulled it out of the box. I say if you plan on leaving this on the counter and don't mind how hard it is to spin it, go for it, it holds quite a bit of bottles. However if you are looking for ease of use and portability, then find a different rack!"
2,Spindles fall off,"This drying rack has a good capacity for holding many bottles and nipples. The plates also provide a platform for drying smaller items that cannot be hooked onto the spindles. Unfortunately, the spindles are not snug fitting on the rack. The spindles constantly fall off the rack, and we are constantly having to look on the kitchen countertop for spindles so that we can dry more bottles. What good is a drying rack without its spindles?"
4,Lt,We ended up with two of these racks because I had so many bottles to dry. They worked better than anything else we tried and I have since given them as shower gifts. I recommend this rack.
3,Not nearly as nifty as it looks in the photo,"The rack must be assembled before use, and may be adjusted to fit the size of bottles that you are using. The problem is that the rack is quite flimsy. Both drying racks are attached to a rod inserted in the center, but with the current design the upper rack is not completely secure and can easily slide down towards the lower rack. The entire unit is somewhat unstable. The unit itself is rather tall, so if you have low cabinets, in can be a bit difficult to store bottles on the top part of the unit. All of this is not to say that you can't dry your bottles on nipples on the rack--if you turn anything up-side-down, it will dry. But, for the money, I would purchase something more like the Dr. Brown's drying rack (which I did)."
5,Buenisimooo,"Producto en excelente estado, lo recomiendo amplia mente, yo vivo en Venezuela y el producto me llego en muy buen estado"
4,Good drying rack,First off I will let you know that we dry Tommee Tippee bottles and Medela pump parts on this rack. It works well. Easy to assemble and much cheaper than our Boon Grass rack that we have. I really like how much fits on here and that it spends. Great product for the money.
1,Should have done my research!,I bought this recently not knowing it was so flimsy. I tried my best to balance my Life factory bottles on this and gave up because it was so unstable. I had to break out my oldMunchkin Sprout Drying Rackthat I used with baby #1! The sprout is super strong and has no problems holding six 9oz bottles on top and six 4oz bottles on the bottle. I didn't realize how awesome the Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack was until I got this one!
1,Good Grief! Feel like I'm in a cartoon...,"Good Grief! Feel like I'm in a cartoon...I put a glass bottle on, the peg falls off. The tiers collapse. The drawer is too small to hold anything. I am too busy with the baby to deal with the million parts. I just bought the OXO tot drying rack and although it will take more counter space, it doesn't need assembly and I'll be happy not to deal with all the constantly falling pegs and collapsing layers."
3,Good bottle rack; if you don't dry bottles on it.,"This rack works for the purpose for which I purchased it: to dry bottle parts, but not bottles.We use Playtex Ventaire bottles. The bottle bodies go in the dishwasher, and I wash all of the parts (nipples, nipple ring, bottom ring, caps, and silicone vent cover) by hand. I use this rack to dry just those parts. It is pretty flimsy -- the vertical posts frequently come out and the top has collapsed when I've put too much weight on it. But it works for our purpose.If you want to dry bottles, don't buy this rack -- especially if you use glass bottles. Giving it 3 stars because it works great for my purpose, but wouldn't work well for the purpose that it is advertised for (drying BOTTLES)."
2,Second level started to fall,"This system did a good job until apparently the support ring for the second level deformed and it started to fall, pretty much making the system unusable. It is a good, large drying system if you can prevent your's from doing this."
1,Horrible product!,"I got this drying rack at my baby shower and thought it would be great because it turns and I could get at the bottles with ease. I was so wrong! This is the worst drying rack ever! The top is so flimsy, things kept falling off and I had to rewash and resterilize them! I am now going out to buy another drying rack, I hope I get one that really works."
2,Too flimsy and falls down too quickly,"We have had this bottle rack for about a year now and initially we thought it was a good investment. That was until the top rack kept falling down and this is WITHOUT glass bottles. When the top rack falls you pick it up to reposition it and the small plastic things at the top fall everywhere, so you have to remove those before repositioning the rack. It has just become more annoying than useful."
2,Great Space Saver; shoddy design,I love the vertical and two-tier design because it helps to save counter space. What I don't like is the quality of the design - the pegs keep falling off. The drain is not very effective unless your counter-top is also sloped. The rack also needs to have more center weight to accommodate heavy glass bottles - it sometimes topples over when I don't evenly distribute bottles on the rack.
5,good product,Bought this as a gift for my son and his wife they told me they REALLY like it. It's sturdy helps keep the bottles etc in one place. They give this five stars!and as always delivery was fast!
4,Get's the job done!,"We keep this next to the sink so that it's near our formula and easy to make a bottle right there. Our baby is barely a month old, so we are doing so many frequent feedings that we just use it to store our bottles after they dry as well-works great. No real complaints. We use 8oz and 4oz Advent bottles and it holds them up just fine. We also store tops, pumping parts and tools from my breast pump as well as pacifiers.I can see it not being sturdy enough for glass bottles as another reviewer mentioned, but I honestly took a look at a few other drying racks in the stores and didn't see many that would. My only small complaint would be it's little tall store in our lower cupboard when we need to, but it works pretty well for us!"
5,Perfect for Dr. Brown's bottles too... :-),"After using another bottle rack for about 4 months, I bought this one hoping it would hold all of the Dr. Browns parts so they weren't spread out all over my counter, and I couldn't be happier! It easily holds 8 sets of bottles and parts and they are still easy to get to. The rack seems a little flimsy at first, but it's not flimsy, just flexible. We have travelled with it using it in hotel rooms and family's houses and it does a great job keeping things altogether and in their places. My neighbor has been using the rack Dr. Browns makes and likes this one better! It's easier to get to the parts on the bottom level. Highly recommend it, especially if you're using Dr. BrownsProsCompactDurableEasy To CleanEasy To Use"
1,Cheap & flimsy junk. Get the Munchkin one instead,"Should've listened to all the 1-star & 2-star reviews. Sticks fly out easily, racks don't turn unless you hold the center rod, water collecting tray doesn't stay put. The whole thing just feels very cheaply made. For $2 extra, get the Munchkin one instead. Much more sturdy & better quality. The sticks actually are foldable on the Munchkin model, so they'll not come out. You can actually rotate both plates easily."
1,"worst quality,, 2$ is right price if you want to purchase","By seeing pictures in Amazon website... I thought the plastic, rods and other material which they used to build this item are high quality standard,, At least it will match with the price..But its huge disappointment... As soon as you open the box you will feel cheaper plastic smell... I donot know whether we can keep sensitive things like baby bottles into this cheaply made plastic.The tray which they showed on picture to collect the water... is not attached to main stand.. It lies as a different piece.. So you need to be careful whenever you are using to pull the bottles from stand,, other wise high chances are that water in the collecting tray may spill over into the table/floorMore over.. I am not getting why they are charging around 10$ for this... If you ask me two dollars is the right price.."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this product based on the many good reviews. It does hold a lot of bottles (we have 6 wide neck Born Free plastic bottles), pumping implements and accessories, but takes up a lot of space. The most disappointing thing about it is that it is VERY flimsy. The plastic pegs come off too easily, the spinning parts are not level and the entire unit does not seem too robust. Also, the drip tray does not attach to the module and just sits underneath. This is a nice idea in concept, but it is not well-made. I have just bought a Munchkin deluxe drying rack which has a better feel to it."
5,This is awesome,"Great for all of my breast pump parts to wash and air dry, and all bottles and accessories to air dry and store. It fits great next to my sink in my kitchen to keep everything organized and clean. And it was really easy to put together."
5,One of the best...,I've seen and used a number of drying racks with my nieces/nephews and children I babysat. This is by far my favorite. It has A LOT of room so you can get a lot of bottles and accessories on it. It takes up very little space. It is tilted so that water runs off into a little tray instead of gathering and molding on the racks. Just in general a WONDERFUL product.
3,Alright,I like everything about it & its a good size the only thing I didn't like is that the little white plastic sticks that hold the bottles aren't strobg there all cheapy.. That is if yuh want to dry GLASS bottles . If you only use plastic or intend to use it for plastic only then this is for you
2,FIRST YEAR DRYING RACK,FIRST YEAR SPINNING RACK IS SMALL!! TO FIT BOTTLES ON SO I SUGGEST A DIFFERENT ONE OTHER THAN THIS ONE THIS ONE IS COMPACT SMALL STYLE!! KRISTEN!!! PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME ORDERINGTHIS READ REVIEWS U WILL BE DISAPOINTED!!! KRISTEN WARNING! SMALL!!!!!!! WARNING SMALL!!!!!
5,Great..,I haven't tried the product yet as my baby isn't born. But it seems to be a good product with good quality. There were many parts to put it together but not too tricky.Shipping was fast too.
4,"Great product, especally if you pump as well","Before this product, I was drying all my pump parts and bottles on a drying mat, flimsy and not mobile. With this rack, I can easily transfer it from the sink, to the table area, and it takes up very little room. The parts spin making it so much easier to put your parts on easier to dry, and to take them off when putting together your pump parts.The only thing i don't like is the drip tray. you have to carry it seperately, it does not attach to where it drips from, you just put it under."
2,"flimsy, impractical","pretty flimsy. the design on the product picture looks appealing, but in reality it is actually very non-functional so to speak. not easy to put in and get out sterilized feeding bootles, nipples at all. pretty impractical IMO."
5,Great drying rack!,I purchased this to help dry all the Avent bottles I wash and sterilize. I really love the size and how it's two tiered - it saves room on the counter while still able to dry a lot of bottles. I use the Avent bottles and I think I'm able to dry at least 12 x 4oz bottles plus extra room for a few pacifiers.
1,Flimsy rack,"This rack is flimsy not really meant for glass bottles. I ended up buying the Dr Brown's drying rack which consists of two tray that take up a lot of room, butit is sturdier than this one which I was not able to use at all because of the weak pegs on the rack."
2,Lightweight.,If you are using glass bottles this rack is not very useful. The weight of the bottles actually bends the spools that are designed to hold the bottles for drying. Its designed for lghter weight plastic bottles and looks like it would work well for that purpose.
5,Good size and convenient,"This drying rack is very good size, I use it every day to dry the bottles, pacifiers and parts from my pump. For those who wonder if you really need it or not - it's useful and I'm glad I got it."
2,Constantly falling apart,I received one of these as a baby shower gift. I wish someone had given it to me after my daughter was born so I would have a chance to test it out and return it. The thing can't hold a full rack of bottles. It may not have helped that I had glass baby bottles as well as plastic. I did keep the heavy bottles on the bottom rack but that didn't help. The top rack every so often collapses onto the bottom rack. It's truly annoying. The only reason I gave it two stars was because I could remove the top rack and simple use the bottom.
4,Does the job!,"I purchased this product elsewhere for a good price and it works great. The only downfall would be that it's hard to get stuff that's put in the middle spots with bottles hanging in the way. However, it holds plenty and I love how it drains directly into the sink."
5,Exactly what I am looking for,"I love the way it is desiged and the way it spins. All kinds of bottles, nipples, pacifiers, teethers fit."
4,Great drying rack and long lasting as well!,"We got this based on other reviews and word of mouth from friends and family. It's easy to use, easy to clean and store away very easily. The only draw back is that the sticks that hold your bottles up can get bent over time if you leave your bottles on me for a long period of time. We only found this to be true no the large 8 ounce bottles and not the 4 ounce bottles."
4,Generally good,"This is generally a really good product. I have had it on my kitchen counter since my son's first bottle. It stays very clean, allows his bottles and teething rings to dry well, and does not take up a whole lot of space. My only complaint is that it sometimes requires both hands to rotate the bottom level. Not always convenient when holding a wiggly baby, but it does exactly what it advertises for a good price. I can't imagine not having it."
2,Worked really well.. at first,"I've been using this bottle drying rack for about 7 months. It had been working really well. Occassionally one of the plastic pegs would fall out.. which was no biggie.. you just pop it back in. However, in the past 2 weeks, it's started colllapsing. Basically, the top falls to the bottom and you can't really pull it back up very easily. This is really irritating when you you have it filled with bottles and bottle parts. Btw, I don't use glass bottles.. so I'm not sure why my plastic bottles are now to heavy for it. I'm so frustrated with this that I'm about to buy the Skip Hop Drying Rack."
5,Love it! gets the job done.,pretty good product. Gets the job done. collects dust after awhile so keep it clean like any other rack. The price was well worth it.
4,"FUNCTiONAL w/o taking up a lot of space, but...","Not all features that this product claims are done well, but it is still amazing. When there are too many things on top, the top piece falls. Also the water catcher tray isn't very efficient. Still love this product though. I like that the water is drained off the dishes and this really can hold a lot."
4,we like it,Easy to assemble and lots more room than our previous one so able to fit all bottles and pacifiers. Looks good and love that it spins.
2,Not sturdy,"Even with plastic bottles, this was really flimsy. Please shop around before you buy this! I got one way better for the same price."
4,gets the job done,"It is pretty flimsy but it gets the job done well, so long as you don't move it around much. If you do, it'll fall apart."
4,Great Product,"Really like this spinning bottle rack. The only two downsides for me are I wish the bottom rack was a half a centimeter higher so that when it had weight on it, it would spin better! I also wish the drain tray was attached to the rack so it couldn't move away from the drain. All in all a nice bottle rack."
4,It gets the job done,"I'm satisfied with this drying rack. It gets the job done. Bottles dont dry as fast on the bottom as they do on the top, The drip tray is kind of annoying, there should be a more secure way of attaching it."
2,Very flimsy; starts to collapse over time - NOT recommended.,"This is a pretty good design for taking advantage of the but is very flimsy.The problem is the faster of the second level becomes weak and won't hold it up so you inevitably have it collapse when putting bottles on it to dry.This results in a large noise, once clean now dirty bottles hitting the floor, etc...you get the idea.Not recommended."
2,Rather flimsy,"I was surprised by how flimsy and fragile this thing is. It's pretty much useless for glass bottles (although, adequate for plastic)."
3,Good Rack - But Flimsy and Drain Rack is Useless,"This was a definitely needed item, and it does it's job well. It's not the sturdiest thing in the world, but is handy and lightweight and takes up little room on the counter.The only questionable gimmicky thing is that ""drainer drawer"". It's completely useless. Not only is the rack not tilted, so water doesn't actually go to the tray, the tray is not attached, it's just a piece that you set down; not attached.Minus one stay for the drawer and minus one for being flimsy."
5,Love this!,I love this bottle rack. It saves room and still has enough room for all the bottles & pump parts. It spins which is very nice & it is very sturdy. Highly recommend.
5,First Year Bottle rack,Awesome item. It keeps all of my baby's bottles and other items organized after I was them. It doesn't take up to much space either.
3,It's a Rack!,This product is not flimsy. It is quality for what it is. It is a rack. It does rack-like things. Nothing more. I'm satisfied with the product.Place for improvement: Could include a cover to keep dust off of it when not in use.
2,Missing part,I have got this product but the holding in the middle (the stick that support the second level) did't come and I sent an email complaining about one missing part but nobody cared about my problem...
2,just a rack not a drying rack,"This rack is good to keep all the bottles together but does not serve as a ""drying"" rack. It is not sturdy enough to spin around. (For an example, if you keep all the items as shown in the picture and spin it, items not on the vertical bars will be on the floor). However, for the price I am ok with it, just as a rack."
1,Not for glass bottles for sure!,"It seems like this product would work fine for plastic bottles, but when I was trying to use it for my glass bottles, not only would the little pegs not stay in so they were always falling all over the place, but the spinning feature wouldn't work with the heavier glass bottles. I'd recommend the ""Prince Lionheart Complete Drying Station"" instead. I haven't tried any other products, but the Price Lionheart product still has a small footprint and I can fit more bottles on it and access everything I need. Good Luck!"
1,Big Disappointment,"Where do I start?The top rack collapses if you put any kind of significant weight on it such as one 8 oz glass bottle.The plastic sticks that hold the bottles are made of cheap plastic that bend down if the bottle is warm from the dishwasher or after being boiled.The drain pan doesn't latch on to the bottom tray, this would have been common sense design. Instead if you move the unit the drain pan has to be moved as well.A cloth rag does the job better than this rack.Save your money."
1,"Use it, but not impressed.","I use this item daily to dry my bottles, but that's about it. Bottle storage.It's super flimsy and even with the plastic bottles it knocks around easily. Also, the ""spin"" part of it, well, I just don't really call that spinning. It's easier just to pick it up and turn it IMPO.This is one of the few items I will probably toss out after my son is out of bottle and just get something better next child."
3,Functions well but starting to lose shape,"We have been using this rack for 2 months to dry 8 glass bottles that we sterilize (by boiling) every day. The rack does a good job at holding all the bottles, caps and nipples for drying. However, the stems that hold the bottles up are getting quite bent and I'm concerned that one or more will snap soon."
3,Functional But Flimsy,"This rack is quite flimsy. The vertical pieces are unstable and come off too easily. I've had items go flying when spinning the rack slowly, which is one of the supposed features. However, at this good price, I wouldn't expect it to be the most solid construction anyway. I will say though that the footprint is nice on the counter top, as you can stuff quite a few things on both shelves. This is definitely a worthy purchase in comparison to other drying racks designed for bottles."
2,doesn't hold up,"Had this drying rack for 9 months and the top rack/tray no longer stays in place. It should 'snap' on the the center spindle, but the plastic has flexed to the point that the top rack now falls the minute any notable items (eg. bottles, cups) are placed on it."
1,Disappointed,"I'm so disappointed in this drying rack. My sister-in-law recommended it and swore by it, but the upper shelf on ours collapses often, even if there isn't a lot of weight on it. Plus, the racks don't turn well, especially the lower one. I wish I had not bought this."
5,Fantastic especially for doc brown bottles! Coming from twin mom,"We go through a ton of bottles a day with the twins. We use glass and plastic doc brown bottles. Because it's shape is round you have to balance the glass bottles evenly on each side. The top is perfect for all the parts to the doc brown bottles. We've been using this for almost 4 months (so yes, we are in the big glass bottles) and it's still holding up great. We originally had some flimsy rack my husband picked up one night on the way home which was horrible. Love the way the water drains off so your bottles aren't sitting in water and ick. Definitely a fan of this!"
5,Wonderful!,"This beautiful handmade book is a captivating collection of poetry, essays and stories. Renea gives us a glimpse into the life of her diabetic daughter, and the heart of the mother who must live the disease with her. Her writing is nicely enhanced by the poignant, original drawings by Jeanne Young."
1,"Unrealistic, Anti-Police Garbage","This book illustrates a flawed understanding of youth violence in the inner cities. The solution of making violence a public health issue works (ONLY on paper) and the concept of ""community policing"" is nothing new. Prothrow-Stith fails to mention the Senior Lead Officer, which is an important piece of this concept. There is a strong anti-police overtone throughout the book. I am certain this comes from the criminals the author has bonded with in the ER room. Too bad she hasn't walked the thin blue line and seen first hand the damage these criminals cause to their victims and society as a whole. Rather than demand they take responsibility for their actions, this book places blame elsewhere."
5,Dvorak Lieder,"The following is a conversation that took place between Antonin Dvorak and myself.Dvorak: Hello, how are you today?me: Good how are you?Dvorak: Great, I just heard a recording of some Lieder I composed and I'm really happy with it.me: Really I didn't know that you composed Lieder.Dvorak: Yeah you really should check it out.me: You know I just might, buh bye now!And again about a week later:me: Hey buddy how are you today?Dvorak: Good you?me: Great, hey I did check out that Lieder, great great stuff, you're really a great song composer.Dvorak: I know and everyone always talks about Schubert being so good! Schubert, Schubert, Schubert... My songs are just as good as his.me:Dvorak: Hello?Anyway I'm sorry about that but this is really a great CD, in my book it ranks right up there with the Schwarzkopf Schubert lieder from EMI, the singing is absolutly wonderful. Harmonia Mundi does such a great job of packaging their products as well. Give it a try...and keep me updated!"
4,Great songs!,It was good to get the songs I wanted! It was worth it to get the whole album instead of just buying one song.
4,"Good, different, alternative sacred Christmas music","This is an enjoyable album of praise music and lyricsvery much like my favorite 3 albums by the musicalgroup ""City on a Hill""."
5,Awesome,"The CD contains one of my favorite Christmas songs, Here With Us by Joy Williams. I enjoy the rest of CD. I recommend this CD."
3,SUMMARY,CERTAIN LY A BOOK OF TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS. ENJOYED READING THIS BOOK. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIIS BOOK. ONE YOU SHOULDN'T PUT DOWN.
3,Borrowed idea or common experience?,"I would have felt differently about this book had I not first read ""Secret Life of Bees"". The first few pages nearly made me put it down, feeling that I knew the whole story already. And in truth, I did know it, although the details were different enough that I kept reading. ""Bees"" was a a much better book in terms of writing and character development, telling the age old story of making sense of the complexities of life. Trobaugh's ""Praise Jerusalem"" left me with the same sense of almost being memorable, but ending up being more of an also-ran. Copied or simply a variation on a common theme, there are worse ways to spend a few hours."
3,Not Bad...,"Although the story had merit, and reminded me a bit of The Secret Life of Bees, it tended to get slow in parts. The ending was a little unsatisfying. I would have liked one more chapter."
5,Great for young teens and adults alike.,"I really enjoyed Swan Place. Although it tackled some difficult topics, it did so in such a tactful and thoughful way I would not think twice about letting my young teenage daughter read it."
5,This book is a treasure,"I picked up Swan Place without ever hearing of Augusta Trobough before and I have to tell you I fell in love with the writing stlyle and the main charactor Dove right from page one. Swan Place is the story of Dove, an almost 14 year old girl who has a tough road ahead of her. Doves loving Mamas death causes her to be the one left to take care of her two younger siblings, Molly and Little Ellis while her step-father is out working double shifts and clubbing at the local honky tonk. Dove was raised right by her mama and stands up to the challenges ahead of her including having a new step-mother who is only a few years older than Dove herself, children making fun of her at school for wearing second hand clothes, and a secret about her true parentage.Trombough has a wonderful flow to her writing that just draws you into this story and doesn't let go even once you are finished. This is a must read for all the southern fiction and coming of age readers out there."
4,A Pleasurable Read,"Completely fascinating, this book was full of surprises and wonderful displays of genuine family love. The strength of 14-year-old Dove is remarkable and the caring nature of so many of the characters is something I found pleasing. I reccommend it to anyone looking for some insight into Southern traditions and the true power of prayer."
5,Definitely the best of the Canadian bands,"Luckily, I live close enough to Canada to have heard of these masterful musicians. Great crisp, clean guitar rock with great poetry behind the album. I'm waiting impatiently for their next piece of work."
2,Waste of Money,I have several of her older VHS tapes and a book but this was a total waste of money. Everything was SO rushed and not done as well as her earlier work. I like Joyce's workouts but absolutely would not recommend this DVD.
5,"Just the Basics, But Still Good","Joyce Vedral's books and DVDs are some of my workout staples. I would consider myself an Intermediate-level exerciser, and I can still use Joyce's workouts if I simply increase my weight loads. Her videos are not flashy, and neither is Joyce - it's more like working out with your quirky, really cool aunt than a super-energetic professional fitness instructor. No fancy tricks or moves here, just straight up weight routines. She has a pretty amusing running commentary throughout (she'll say things like ""I'll have you looking so good they're gonna have to call security on you next time you go to the beach!"")and is pretty easy to follow. I found her weight routines a great place to start working out on my own and many years later they are still useful."
4,Looks like picture,This product was a little pricey and a little more bulkier than i exepected but it goes great with the entire set. I would say it's optional. Very detailed switch plate.
4,adorable,I love this product. Looks great in our babygirl's room. It is a little smaller than typical switch plate though
5,Smelling Good,I absolutely love Just Cavalli. It isn't strong. A quiet sent that you can wear everyday if you are so inclined.
1,FAKE FAKE FAKE,"I am so disappointed with what I received. Not only does the bottle look different from my original but it also STINKS. Wish I could return, but amazon won't let me. TERRIBLE."
5,My 2-year boy loves Thomas!,"My 2-year boy loves Thomas! He literally has every 'new' Thomas DVD. When I say 'new' I mean the new CGI Thomas DVDs. Anyways, you really cannot beat the prices on Amazon. Plus it shipped quick to my house. Now my boy has another DVD to watch in the car on the way to school/daycare or the mall. I'm definitely going to buy the new Misty Island DVD through Amazon pre-sale."
4,New CGI Animation - Love it!,"This is an adorable DVD that features my son's favorite - Cranky! This DVD is in the new CGI animation so it is colorful and bright like a regular animated cartoon, rather than how the older Thomas DVDs are - my son prefers it animated. The DVD is fun and full of traintastic adventures where the trains (Thomas especially) learn to work together and listen to others. With four episodes on this, my sons couldn't get enough of it and wanted to watch it over and over! The narrator (Driver Perkins) has a friendly voice and made the episodes flow smoothly!"
2,Not like the originals,"Maybe it's just me, but this new series just seems really generic compared to the original Thomas the Tank Engine shows. Every episode is basically ""Engine gets special job. Engine botches job three times. Authority figure recaps each mistake. Engine fixes mistakes with time to spare."" And whoever's the focus of the story seems to abandon all common sense at the outset. It's not even like the old ones where a character's specific flaw might be their downfall.There's some new engines and machines too, but they don't seem to add much. The animation's not bad (actually one of the best parts), but it doesn't have all the industrial activity and background detail you might have seen in the show 20 years ago. Instead of pulling coal, lumber, or boxcars, the engines seem to pull car loads of ice cream, merry-go-rounds, and cakes.I'd recommend a disc of the older episodes instead. There's more visible craftsmanship, more originality, and the characters really grow on you."
4,Boring...but excellent primer,"This is a pretty good book for the adult learning to play the piano. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's quite boring, but it serves the purpose. At our local small town university I was able to take a piano class for adults and the teacher allowed us to use our own choice of books. I'm not disappointed with my choice. My only regret is that they should have included a CD with it. Then again, my book is used - so the new book may include a CD."
5,great book for those who want to teach themselves to play the piano!!,"Great book, especially for those who want to teach themselves to play the piano. I'm almost done with the first book now and am really excited as I know that I have made a huge progress since I first started to play the piano. The theory sections are not extremely long. However, they provide you with the basic information about the musical terminology and major scales. As someone who doesn't have a teacher and who had never played the piano before purchasing this book, I never get frustrated with the way the songs and other material are presented. I believe it's a great book for serious beginners who are determined to learn to play the piano with or without a teacher."
5,music books,Great prices--I saved over $15 on what is cost me to buy the same 3 books at the local music store. Loved the free shipping and no sales tax. Books came very fast.
3,Not what I thought I ordered,I was very disappointed with the condition of this item. It was written in and all over about to keel over due to old age. However it does appear to be a valuable resource.
2,Piano lesson course below average,The Piano lesson course was difficult to follow and did not seem to cover the basics.
2,Meh,"I bought this book along with The Piano Handbook by Carl Humphries and much prefer the Humphries book. If you just want to play for fun, this book will keep you occupied, but if music is a serious pursuit for you go with the Humphries book. This book will have you playing Jingle Bells and When the Saints Go Marching In, while the Humphries will have you playing some easier Bach and Mozart pieces. It really comes down to personal preference and what you want out of playing, but I thought I'd offer an opposing view to this book's near-unanimous praise. For me, I'll get much more out of the Humpries."
4,Great for beginners,"When I first started taking piano lessons, this was the book my piano teacher and I worked on. The pieces are simple and boring, but yet demanding to the novice. Since it is an all in one book, you really get your money's worth. Playing the piano is not just about hitting keys, so one must learn some basics about chords and so forth. This book is a great primer.I highly recommend this book."
5,A great way to learn!,"The best things about this book are, first, it's fast paced; the lessons and pieces focus on specific skills and positions. They don't linger for too long on just playing the melody. They get you playing harmonies and chords, get you into different postions within the first few pages. It is up to you to decide when you're ready to move on. There's also curt, but thorough explanations so that you're not left in the dark about why such-and-such is done such-and-such way, or what the sharps and flat symbols mean next to the cleff symbol. Lastly, they don't make you play a whole bunch of goofy ""child"" songs that might turn off an older student from getting involved in this instructional book.I wish I had this book years ago. I must encourage anyone who is picking this book up to buy a metronome as well. These are invaluable!"
5,Great for beginners,"I'm loving this book. Its great for beginners and has easy instructions that a novice can understand.Great songs to practice too even if they are a little ""child-like"". Jingle bells is one that I just learned and since Christmas will be here soon, it's great to be able to play it well."
5,Great Book for beginners!,"I'm beginner in Piano lessons. I bought this book as a recommendation from a friend, and I'm amazed the way the lessons are presented teaching the basics with practical exercise. I'm looking forward for the second level."
4,All you need to start,I'm not giving a 5 because I think that the CD must come with the book and I don't have to buy it from some place else.The book is very well organized and complete. A great choice.
5,Perfect for the absolute beginner,"I picked this up upon a recommendation and based on the many positive reviews here. I was a total piano beginner at age 31 and have been using this for over 2 weeks now. It's almost as if it was tailor made for the way I learn. I'm progressing nicely through it without much trouble so far. I plan on completing this and moving to book 2 by this Fall perhaps. If not sooner.If you follow the process as it is presented, you will learn ways of reading the music that is beyond the normal note recognition and memorization techniques. That makes for faster learning and easier note recognition. For example, it trains you to recognize intervals between notes to move fluidly instead of trying to identify each note before playing it. It's working very well."
4,Good intro book,"This book is good for students learning how to play piano and read music. If you are already familiar with reading music, you may want to look elsewhere. It starts out very basic and slowly becomes more challenging, which is good for the beginner!!!I wish the songs in it were more well known or interesting to play as I often find that I'm not very interested in learning how to play the short pieces in this book. Other than that, it has good instruction at an intro level."
5,Best book I've tried for learning piano from scratch!,"I've tried 4 different books to date in my attempt to learn piano. This is the only one that has gone into enough specifics and depth for me to learn well and actually understand the different keys/markings on the staff and grand staff. This starts you from some hand exercises and how to sit properly before even teaching you a single note! Easy to learn exercises and they go along with what the current lesson is. I'm having a great time and can't wait to get into the more complicated stuff later in the book.*Haven't used the DVD yet, but I appreciate that it's there if I want to make use of it."
3,Book is great ... cd sucks,I purchased this book with the CD hoping that it would explain more then just the book by itself...it doesn't. In fact I get more out of the book then I do the CD. I could always look up the song on youtube to know how it sounds IF I didn't already know the song. I really doubt I will purchase any more of the CDs that go with this series...though my level two book came with the CD as well..level 3 did not. I know I wouldn't spend an extra $10 on the cd. I averaged out my stars...it would have been 5 for the book and 1 for the cd (really a 0 but not allowed to go that low).
5,Great book!,I just love Alfred's books! It's easy to teach and it's easy to learn. Either way its a great product!
5,It's just this simple!,"IF YOU DON'T HAVE Workshop of the Telescopes, then you are not a Fan of B.O.C. Possibly the finest collection of Songs ever compiled. It really show's their diverse musical styles. It's more than a Greatest Hits, probably why they didn't call it that!"
2,Get the Albums,"This collection contains too much filler and doesn't sound so good. My advice: Buy the original albums. Secret Treaties and Agents of Fortune are my personal favorites, but several others contain good material. The biggest problem with Blue Oyster Cult is that, after 1976, their material was uneven. Godzilla is a great tune, but Spectres is not a great album. And so on. Although this collection contains a lot of fine stuff, it's difficult to recommend. A better starting point for the novice would be the albums listed above. Verified fans will probably want a more inclusive, better sounding collection."
2,Root beer barrels,"Inferior quality; small size, too many to have for family use. Better for restaurant or somewhere that has high volume of business. Would not purchase this item again."
5,Perfect for our Root Beer Party!,These candies have great flavor and were very reasonably priced. They were delivered quickly. They were a hit at our root beer themed party.
4,"Old fashioned candy, just like you remember","We ordered these to include in goody bags for an old fashioned birthday party. They give the look and taste of an old fashioned candy, and are not something many kids have enjoyed before. Candies arrived quickly and in good condition."
1,could be a lot better,"I have six Rockaby Baby! cd's. This is my least favorite. I love Nine Inch Nails, but they missed the mark with this one. I was really disappointed when I first listened. Maybe it will grow on me, but it's going to take a while before I listen again."
3,The Start Of The John/Taupin Songwriting Team,"Admittedly, this is the least favorite of my early Elton John CDs, yet it shows much of the promise which Elton John and Bernie Taupin would soon fulfill in their 1970's albums produced by Gus Dudgeon. The two most memorable songs on this CD are ""Skyline Pigeon"" and ""Lady Samantha"". Absolutely this is a must for Elton John fans, though unlike the next CD, ""Elton John"", it is certainly not one of his essential recordings. Gus Dudgeon and his team have done a fine job remastering this early album."
3,Guess I have been spoiled...,"Since I am a fan of Elton John and believe his voice and talent have grown and matured over the years, I received a gift of this album.I can appreciate Elton's roots and his development as an icon.The funny part was that it was a bit jazz, a bit James Taylor and a voice that ranged so differently. It becomes hard to define. His music selections sounded somewhat amateurish.Recording sound quality is not up to today's standards.It is nice to have a beginning reference but if you are starting to collect his music, go for his most popular and newest ventures. They are rock and pop golden.Updating my review...have had the album in my car now for a few weeks, and am enjoying it more as time goes on."
3,Good debut,"Elton John's first official album is not among his most polished but the songs are good and offer a promise of the stronger albums yet to come. ""Western Ford Gateway,"" ""Sails,"" and ""Gulliver"" may not be as familiar as ""Skyline Pigeon"" (which John sang at the funeral of AIDS victim Ryan White), but all are deserving of more note than they have received. Other pleasures, such as ""Valhalla,"" can be found throughout. The one quibble I have is not with the music, but the cover. It may be the original cover but it's still ghastly!!! The artwork that was included in MCA's 1975 American release of the album might have been a better choice with which to decorate the CD."
2,Fans can never be objective...,From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...this is Elton's first album and it's rough around the edges. A good producer could have improved this project and there are a couple of decent tracks including the title song.
2,So-So,You really shouldn't buy this one unless you also buy or have access to the beginning work book because some of the exercises call for you to use work done in the previous book. OK but not great and not as easy to follow as the first.
3,With pistols...,"This exerpt, from Cassanova's autobiography, includes an account of an ""encounter""... I was hoping for a real 17th cent. point-of view about a combat with sharps, but it's with pistols... (wanh-waaanh)"
1,Lost in Verbaige: Karczewski's journey - a short trip,"Raymonds literary style is full of the turgid overblown prose that marks the pseudo-intellectual ramblings of the latter part of the 19th century. The book left me feeling less like I'd taken a journey, and had just read a badly written travel brochure. The writing is verbose to the point that were it tightened just a little, the book would be shortened by about a third. If you are thinking of taking this particular journey, stay home, find a library copy of Norman Vincent Peale, and spend the money on a take-out pizza"
1,What the heck was it?,"The mangled meanderings of the author are so verbally confused as to loose all meaning within the excess verbage. The abuse and over use of adjectives and adverbs would leave a college linguistics professor, dizzied from the experience and the only thing to be gained from this piece of 'literature' is a migraine. What little discernable information is present, is 'borrowed' from popular literature, and is simply an overworded version of something you might find on a religious pamphlet.Whoever this publisher is, Ark Enterprises, they did a terrible disservice to the author by not hiring a qualified editor or literary consultant to screen the text prior to press."
1,Just plain awful...,I can't even bring myself to write a decent critique... the book was just plain awful and that is really all there is to say about it.
3,Not QUITE the same.,"I have purchased Dermalogica from a skin care boutique, and this is NOT QUITE the same. It isn't as rich nor does it cover as well. It also has a bit of a grainy texture. Still, the SPF DOES seem to work, and it moisturises satisfactorally. It's just not the same stuff you get in the store."
3,decent sunblock!,"i bought this for its spf b/c if i try to put other stuff on my face at the beach, it burns like napalm & i'm practically screaming. so it isnt waterproof, which is a shame.it does do a little bit of mattifying, way more than the derma dr product (which does literally nothing), but i think that when your pores want to get ride of their oil, they are going to, & nothing's going to stop them. & is it healthy to stop them?...using those little rice papers seems to me to be the best solution, even tho they're a pain in the neck (to me). rice papers work, w/o messing up the make up.this stuff is really great sunblock, tho!i'm italian, but a pale-faced sort, until a few days down at the shore, sunning on the beach, so i dont need high-powered sunblock ever, but do need something small, like 8-20. this stuff works well, doesnt bug my complexion either. dermalogica makes good products for my hyper-sensitive, combination-type skin because it never ever breaks me out."
5,Great buy for some shuffle music,"The pieces selected are perhaps not the 'best' of Ravel although most famous. The recordings are well done and sound is very clear ! I enjoy all of these. For the reviewer who thought these pieces were movie sound tracks, you are absolutely correct. These people are where these Hollywood 'composers' create their music.. Williams is nothing but a rip off of Mussorgsky and Rimski-Korsakov. At least Walt Disney gave credit to the creators of the music including the Night on Bald Mountain used so much in Star Wars . I am well pleased with my purchase ! and am enjoying the music as i write."
1,Don't waste your money; they break!,"I am only 5'4"", 117 lbs, 60-years old. I am not some super work-out enthusiast. I only use a cable for 3 sets of 30 neck strengthening exercises twice daily. I have never broken a cable before in 3 years of daily use. I purchased these Harbinger Cables because I wanted more resistance than I was getting with my GO-Fit 20 lb. cable, which is still in one piece! The ""Harbinger Cable Super Heavy 30-72lb of Resistance"", placed through the included ""heavy duty woven door jam attachment"" split in half within 3 months of use. Harbinger replaced this cable under their warranty; unfortunately, 3 months later, the replacement is now in 2 pieces, and Harbinger says they don't have anything better than these for me to try. If this ""little old"" lady's exercises break Harbinger's ""best"" cables within 3 months, then how quickly will Harbinger Cables show their defects to you stronger & younger users?!"
2,Broke after a month,"I wanted to give this a good review because in theory it is a great replacement for free weights (for most exercises), and is portable enough to bring on travel. However, after less than a month of using the band it broke! The rubber band itself snapped at the handle (it is attached to the handle by a plug that is inserted in the end of the hollow band to make the band wider than an opening in the handle). I attempted to fix it, but there is no way to get the band back into the handle and make it hold."
2,Excellent sturdy cables for an amazing price EDIT: They Broke After Very Little Use,"These resistance cables are very durable and the handles are well designed but do hurt your wrists a bit after prolonged use. Well worth the money!EDIT: They broke and they weren't even used much. The piece connecting the rubber to the handle snapped off. I tied it so it's still useable, but the resistance isn't quite the same. I guess you get what you pay for!"
1,Doesn't last long,"My second cable just broke in less than 3 months. I bought both bands from Big5. The first time I didn't save my receipt and the store wouldn't honor any warranty. I didn't save my receipt but was sure I only had the band 3 or 4 months. So I bought a second cable and saved my receipt this time. Low and behold, it broke less than 3 months after purchase. I bought the super heavy band. I will call the company today and inquire about the warranty but will start looking for an alternative brand unfortunately. One of the selling features of this band was the big stirrup handle. The back of my hands don't get pinched when doing curls like other brands have done. Bummer."
1,disappointed,"The rubber that the band is made of collects dirt very easily. I have a cat and the first time I used it , it became covered in hair. To compound the problem, it is very hard to clean."
1,Worst hair product I have ever tried,To start off I am not sure if this product was made for African american hair. I am not african american and I have long silky type hair that is wavey and kind of cury but not really. I tried this product in the hopes it will turn my waves more into a curl.I only had to use very little as it goes a long way. By the next day my hair looked DISGUSTING. It looked/was so oily and looked so dirty.I don't have a problem with oily hair- ever have. Not even if i dont was my hair 3 days.
4,Good moisturizer,"I was looking for a light moisturizer for my relaxed hair that wouldn't weigh it down or be greasy. All the other reviews I read were from persons with natural hair but I thought to give it a try. So far, I like it. I use it sparingly after a wash or before I apply heat to my hair. I also use it to two strand twist my 3 year old niece's natural hair and I love the way it comes out. All in all I think this is a good product and I would recommend it. Also, a lot of other reviews complained of the smell. My personal opinion is although it is lemon scented it is soft and not overbearing. I really can't even smell it after a day or so and my husband hasn't complained-I say that b/c if it was a harsh smell he'd be the first person to let me know."
3,an just ok product for a not so okay price,this product is just okay. doesn't really moisturize really coarse hair. probably won't buy again.
4,Mede my curls soft,I bought this product unsure of its purpose. I used it for my naturally curly/wavy ethnic hair. I am getting rid of perm. Worked great when hair was damp! Left curls soft and bouncey. The smell can be strong but I really like it.
4,A little is a ll you need,"Like others with relaxed hair, I have mixed reviews about Carol's Daughter rosemary mint shampoo and black vanilla leave in conditioner. They were horrible; my hair was left matted and brittle yet oily. However, this product isn't so bad. I used it along with khoret amen hair oil as replacements for my normal leave-in condtioner (Dudley's PCA) and serum (Paul Mitchell's Sleek Works) with great results. I experienced less fall-out and my hair was smooth, silky, and wonderfully moisturized without feeling greasy. I didn't experience the stickiness and dullness that results from using the PCA and Paul Mitchell. Plus the scent is lovely without being overpowering. But I must caution you to use only a small amount, and part your hair in sections. This will result in less tugging of the hair in its delicate state."
2,Didn't love it,"I bought this product because I liked how it was made with all natural ingredients. I used it on my 1 year old daugher's hair (4c). I liked the way it smelled. I worked well as a detangler on my daughter's wet hair, but once the hair was dry there was no moisture added. Her hair looked dull and dry. I will use it until the end of the bottle, but I will not be buying it again."
5,Works great for curls,"I have naturally curly hair and buy thousands of dollars worth of product before I can decide on something I like. I LOVE hair milk. I don't have to use anything else like mousse to style. It leaves me with beautiful, bouncy curls. I have even tried Ouidad, which I do not like at all."
2,Too slow for me.,"Story didn't really grab me so I found I didn't really get into it, but the performances were still good and the movie was beautifully filmed."
2,This movie drags on,"I thought I would like this movie since I like historical fiction, the English & the Irish and Maggie Smith. But the story was extremely slow, some of the characters were not believable and the writing wanting. It's interesting that I picked this movie at the same time Downton Abbey was portraying a similar theme: how the Irish wanted the English out of their country. The issues (right down to the burning of an English manor house) were better portrayed by Mr. Fellowes."
1,Boring,"I thought I would like this movie, but I was disappointed. The setting could make for a good film, but this movie was just way too slow and I found it hard to care about any of the characters. I usually enjoy the more deliberate British historical romances (The Remains Of The Day, eg), but this movie bogs itself down far too much."
2,"Dreary, incoherent script.","I give this film two stars for the beautiful photography and music. The acting wasn't too bad either, though not stunning. But the editing and script truly left something to be desired. Flashback scenes interspersed at random threw the average viewer into a state of confusion. Characters of indeterminite relationship flew in and out in dizzying succession. The character development unfolded abruptly in harsh jerks, with very little subtlety. Most of the characters were quite one-dimensional, especially the young girl's two ""lovers"". One was a dumb, shallow cocky Englishman, and the other was a dumb, coarse, brutal Irishman. They were supposedly the two extremes that clashed over the anglo-Irish, but as symbols of the two cultures they fail dismally. All in all, a depressing, pointless and fairly inaccurate portrayal of Northern Ireland in the 20's."
2,Do not buy it.......bog dissapointment if you like hard rock,"I'm a lover of bands like Blindside, P.O.D. and Project 86. Hardcore rock fans....DO NOT buy this one. It sucks. Very badly in my opinion. When the lead singer screams he sounds horrible. It sounds no where near what a scream should sound like. Furthermore it is hard to find out what a chorus and a verse are in many songs because they sound exactly the same often times. There are only three songs on this album I can listen to wholly before skipping it. There are other better bands out there that whip Dizmas easily. I gave them a try and I honestly tried to hear what everyone thought was so great about them. I can't find it no matter how hard I try. Mediocre lyrics. Music is sometimes good but mostly boring without much differentiation."
5,"Brilliant ""Noise Makers""","After watching this ensemble play together, I knew that I had to put my money towards buyin yet one another record....I was quite pleasantly surprised by the COMPLEXITY of the sound, and their album 'On a Search In America"", still is sittin in my player- The Dizmas passion on-stage shouts (literally) into the new album with their brilliant melodies, guitar parts, and thoughtful & honest lyrics. I am confident that their willingness to serve will continue to bless them w/opportunities to make jaw-gripping music. These guys understand what it means to live. Get this one! This time you won't be upset w/yourself-"
4,Sweet!,"This is a cd for all your punkers or rockers! It has some good songs on it. I really like the guitars on here, they are pretty sweet sounding!"
5,Why YOU should buy this CD!,"Hey lets support some of the greatest guys ever! If you're reading this and you've heard the Dizmas then you know what I'm talkin about, if you're reading this and you haven't heard them what are you doing?? Stop reading this and go listen to them! I'd sure as heck rather listen to them than me. Seriously though, if you're looking for some great instrumental talent, they're are the ones. And talk about voices. You just can't beat the Dizmas so listen to they're music and buy the CD.Peace"
5,"Their talent is on loan from God, who can beat that?","The guys in Dizmas are incredible musicians, the instrumentals are awesome and the vocals are hard to beat. If you're looking for music thats the same old same old, these guys are definately not for you....But if you're looking for a one of a kind sound, awesome lyrics, and a band singing about what really matters, you've found the right one. These guys could do awesome as a secular artist if they chose to....The fact that they CHOOSE to use their talent to glorify God is all the more reason to listen to this cd :) My favorite song on this album is ""So Long My Friends""."
5,A Great Daily Life Resource for Medieval Times,"If you are looking for a medieval ""Daily Life"" reference book that provides abundant detail for topics such as hospitality toward guests, food and drink, entertainment, and domestic routines, this is the one. This book begins by providing the big picture of the medieval household with an overview of the typical size and it then touches on the role played by every member from servants to clergy to the nobility. It also has beautiful and useful illustrations that help bring all those domestic details to life. All in all, in addition to being a reference source (there is a comprehensive subject index) this book provides an enjoyable insight into the medieval society for anyone interested in the time period. Enjoy!"
3,a reference book,"A detailed account on a few wealthy households based on thier record keeping, this makes a good reference book. It can be tedious in its reporting of expenses (the average American will not understand the monetary values) and although it does make use of a glossary, many terms are obscure. If your interest in medieval history is a serious one, you will find this to be useful."
3,Good book - CD doesn't work always,"The book covers all the material that you would need for GMAT. Tests are similar to what you would expect in the real test. Yes the kaplan tests are slightly more difficult than the real gmat.But getting the CD-ROM to work can be a hassle. You must have a multimedia PC to install it. Without a multimedia pc it wont even install. I think the software on the cd should have the option of running on a non-mutlimedia pc (just give the text without the audiovisual Drama). Also it has problems with certain soundcards, I believe. I actually installed a different sound card on my PC to get the cd-rom to work."
2,Does not work with W2k or Win 98 without WAV File playback,"I purchased this book / CD with the intent primarily of using the CD. After many attempts, installing the CD has been unsuccessful. The CD will NOT work on W2k. The tech support desk sent the following msg to me ""Thank you for contacting us, although we are sorry to advise you that this software is not compatible with Win 2000, WinPro or NT."" I then tried to install it on my wife's pc (Win 98) also to no avail. I hope this helps someone save their hard earned $$. Try another book / CD combo."
3,Warning about Disk,"The disk is great if you can get it to work. I know your first thought is this guy is an idiot, but I am a business analyst with a good amount of programming experience. The problem is that they don't tell you it won't work with 2000 and above until after you call Technical Support (don't bother with them) even though the package says 95 and higher. I installed it and it worked fine for a awhile and then it just stopped. Great software while I had it though."
3,Kaplan may NOT help you,"...Though some claimed that the real score can be as much as 150 higher than those scored in Kaplan, this is no longer true. There has been a system error (bug error) in the ETS's computers and that can seriously lower your score, despite the amount of study you have done. I have studied for 4 months, full-time for it and have done over 5000 questions from sources like kaplan, ets and gmatplus. ppl say that if you score 550 in kaplan then you must score 650 and above in the real test. well, my score today was shocking , 550. I had a system error message at the end of test and the admin guy just rebooted the system when i raised this issue to him. but when i later checked the forums in businessweek.com and review.com, i discovered there are so many ppl out there filing complaints against ets. These ppl have scored high in kaplan, pr, etc. ..but shockingly low in the real test...."
1,Kaplan Gmat with CD-ROM,"All the important tests and explanations are in CD rom. But whenever I tried to do full CAT test, the program did not run. I triedto use their email customer services. But they only responsed once. Their only response asked for further information. Then I replied to them a month ago. No reply at all. So, If you are going to take GMAT exam, do try this book. You may end up just waste your money."
2,Urgh!,"Ok, so I understand that to do well on the GMAT you need to get some of the more difficult problems right. That said, the Kaplan problems are much more difficult than those on the test. It was helpful to work on the tough problems, but I think there is just too much focus on the tough stuff so that it severely hurt my self esteem. And I still did fine on the GMAT."
2,Good Questions- bad CD's,"Kaplan provides a good series of hard questions. Therefore, if you don't mind working from the book, you won't be disappointed. However, a ""glitch"" is that most Kaplan CD's do not work on Windows 2000 or NT systems!! You can call the Kaplan Technical Support line and they will tell you that many many users have this complaint, they will add your complaint to the list, and then advise that you find an older computer or sign up for a Kaplan course if you would like on-line or CD access. (They will apologize too if that makes you feel better.) Therefore, yes good questions if you can get to them!!"
2,Martha Misleads,"I was disappointed in several aspects of this DVD. First of all, if you are an avid Martha-on-TV watcher, you have probably seen most of these segments. Secondly, the cake on the case front is not shown or demonstrated on the DVD. Thirdly, the wedding gown segments are virtually repeats of one another--showing the typical silhouettes of wedding gowns and recommendations of figure types for each."
2,Feh.,"I think money would be better spent on a subscription to Martha Stewart Weddings, where I find better/more ideas and instructions in almost every issue.I was able to rent this DVD from my library for $1."
4,Perfect for Wedding Planners or Do It Yourself Brides,"I would have given this 5 stars if I was a Wedding Planner. But as a Bride to be it was a bit too informative. The DVD's are very detailed on arranging flowers, baking cakes, types of linen, dresses, the behind the scenes information. Each segment seems to be from Martha's shows. She is very descriptive and gives a ton of info. She is a bit dry by nature, so it's not very bubbly. But if you are coordinating your wedding and you want as much info as you can get, I would recommend these DVD's. I personally wished that they would have had more ""real"" wedding examples and maybe taken you from beginning to end of 4 different style and budget type events. But not a total waste of $$$."
5,Excellent approach and really insightful,"If you have to deal with Customer Data Warehouse, this book will save you some precious time and improve your learning curve. It has two main contributions in the project :- Data modeling : provides you tools and hints how to think about data modeling in a ""Customer centric data warehouse""- Project management : presents useful tools and business case approachI highly recommend it for anyone involved in a CRM / Data Warehouse project"
5,design in a readable book,I found this book very helpful. I needed the intro. on CRM and it puts what I am trying to achieve in context.I think the physical implementation guide is especially helpful. The dot model concept is an inspiration and I intend to try out the customer workshops.
5,Finally an M.D. that unmasks the Vasectomy Conspiracy!,"Men;Do yourself a favor make a small investment, by this book before its too late. Dr. Roberts pulls no punches, he tells you what very, very few Drs. with admit to. Yes, there are many complications,and the complications, if you are in the 2-15% that ends up with a problem, your LIFE will NEVER be the same.I wish I would have known now, about this book in 1989 or I never would have done it. Dr. Roberts has the balls to tell the truth, which will probable anger all the Urologists and other Drs.for letting the cat out of the bag. This procedure is a cash cow for for many a Dr. And if you go back to your Dr. with problems they LIE about what's wrong.Unfortunately, the cure for most of the problems is very expensive micro-surgery. I know because I've been there."
1,Totally Disappointed - Nothing about Chronic Pain Syndrome,"Had almost nothing about Post Vasectomy Pain Syndrome which was what I have and was hoping would be addressed in the book. Title is great, but content totoally lacked this most important subject matter. - what a shame..."
1,The most pathetic book on earth.,"This book might have been useful in 1972, but in the miracle age of ""word processors"" this book has absolutely no purpose beyond killing roaches. You might as well open up Microsoft Word, type out the alphabet and switch between fonts."
1,Very Confusing-Basicly for adults,I read this book as an 8th grade Honors English student and it was very confusing and difficult to understand. But it was a pretty good book. I would recomend this to older readers.
3,Erm....,"I had to read this book for Honor English Eight, and all I really have to say is it's ok. I didn't like the witchcraft in it and the first chapters were confusing. Once I got to the middle of the book it got more interesting and easier to understand, and one part and the end didn't make much sense...So not bad, not great. I don't think I would read it again.On a positive note, the imagery was good and the one chapter with the ladies being scared of the Lonely One was interesting."
1,Don't Waste Your Money or Your TIME!!!,"For those of you who enjoy artificial vanilla and cliff notes this is your new favorite book on CD!! For those of you who hold out for the finer things in life it is nothing but a HUGE let-down. Dandelion Wine is one of the best books Ray Bradbury has written. This third rate production does no justice to the eloquence or mystery of the book. I would highly reccomend the unabridged ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" by Ray Bradbury in lieu of this imposter."
5,Bradbury is a Graet American Writer,"Bradbury is a great American writer, and draws you into episodic illustrations of life, painting a story with deep poetic images and emotions. I put him up there with Mark Twain and Hermann Hesse and Dostoyevski. His style is to present a battery of vingettes that, like the facets of a cut gem, show us many different facets of our emotional universe. He presents a Mark Twain-like panorama of the world seen thru the eyes of two adolescent boys in Midwest America, bringing us back to the scope of innocence and curiosity and the magic of being open to the wonder of the world. I think it is particularly good for teenagers in this age to see the realistic, yet poetic and magical view of youth. This book will take you back to the magic of your boyhood summers if you are older."
3,Dandelion Wine,"I thought this book had alot of deeper meanings to it, yet hard to understand. The book was more like a lot of little stories - each with their own meaning, and lesson. You could really learn alot about life from all the little things it taught you. In general i thought this book to be deep and powerful, but hard to grasp."
2,Not as good as he has done...,"I believe Ray Bradburys book, Dandilion Wine, is a good book, but I also believe it is not equal to what he has or could have written. I read Fharenheite 451, and that was great. This is simply a good book, and a great book for most other writers, but just a average book for Ray Bradbury."
5,Summer in a book,"""Dandalion wine, the words were summer on the tongue, the wine was summer caught and stoppered""If you want to feel happy, sad, alive and relaxed read this book. The imagery is magnificent. You can feel the sun, hear the cicadas, and smell the newly cut grass. You can fall in love and discover that you're alive.An all time favorite of mine. I've read it over and over again."
4,Brilliant,"So full of lyrical prose, and delicious adjectives that you want to wrap yourself up in it, and never put it down. Not because the story is so good, it is actially a very simple, static tale, but the laguage is so rich, it almost seems like poetry.If you are an author, or are wanting to be an author, or have ever even considered the idea for more than a minute, pick up this book, and find out what it means to wield a pen with such skill and dexterity that you make it seem effortless."
5,Bradbury Shrugs Off The Shackles Of Sci-Fi & Horror To Create Another Masterpiece,"Dandelion Wine is not the typical Ray Bradbury novel and yet, in many ways, it is. Whimsical and charming with so much childhood dreams packed into its pages, you can't help but fall right into it. 12 year-old Doug Spaulding is the main character and we follow him through his fantastic world, smelling the wet grass, climbing through the trees, running hellbent through the ravine with a serial killer in tow. Dark in places, but lighter in most others, I use Dandelion Wine to cleanse myself after reading something gritty ala Clive Barker or Thomas Harris. One of my all-time favorites (many of which were written by none other than Ray Bradbury) Dandelion Wine shines.Dig it!"
5,Summer School Book Talk,"I taught summer school this year, and I use this to ""break the ice."" We listened to the chapter about buying new shoes as a summer tradition and how ""new shoes would make [him] run faster.""Dandelion Wine is more memoire, although it has some elements of fantasy in it. It's a feel-good book about being a kid, enjoying summer, and recognizing that life is passing but that what's in the here and now is as precious as the ""Dandelion Wine"" that the old people make and drink while you (as a kid) hang out under the porch listening to their stories. It's a coming of age book, while at the same time, being a snapshot of childhood.This story, because it's set in the early 1900's, is timeless. It's a chance to think about endless summer. I paired it with the Beach Boys (which for my sophomores are equally old and classic!!!) and it was a hit."
4,"Forced to read, ended up liking it","The book reads quickly and it is written very well. It must be difficult for a grown man to write from the perspective of a 12-year-old boy. Overall i thought that it was a good story and I would recommend this book to others. Also this book shows how you can grow up very fast in a short period of time. The main character in this story grew up rapidly in only one summer. Also it triggers memories from your own child hood which got me thinkin about my childhood and how much fun I had, and how much I miss it. Even though I'm only 19 years old after reading this book and thinking about my past I feel much older than I am."
4,Dandelion Wine Book Review,"To me I think ""Dandelion Wine"" is a great book to read. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat in anticipation for the events to come. The adventures with Doug and Tom keep me very attentive to what happensfollowing the different types of conflicts that they encounter throughout the novel. Although boring at some times, the exciting events which take place make up for all the ""lost time."" With exciting plots such as the unraveling of the murderer called 'the lonely one,"" and the discovering of the ""happiness machine."" I really enjoyed this book and would definitely recommend this novel to young adolescents who are either experiencing, or will expereince ""rite of passage"" either sooner or later."
1,Summer Reading,"I was assigned by my highschool to read Dandelion Wine as a summer reading book. Going into my freshman year I was only used to the books that they had us read in Grade School and Middle School. I was used to books with plot and a good story line good for doing a project on or taking a test. I have to take a test on Dandelion wine, and feel completly unprepared for it for the lack of story line in Dandelion Wine made the book especially hard to follow. As a reader I am disappointed. I thought the book was frankly a waist of my time, I would encourage my highschool to replace this book with another book for the list but I beleive that it is just not my place. Sorry to import dicipointing news."
2,I love cookies.,This book talks about cookies and more cookies and more cookies and more cookiesssssssss.
2,I struggled,"I wanted to read the advanced book on the list of choices for summer reading 2 years ago. So, I chose Dandelion wine.I was 12 then and I struggled through every page not understanding the plot or signifigance at all. To me it was a bunch of stories about different people in one town haphazardly thrown together with no discernable connection.Maybe if I were to read it again today I could appreciate it better or at least understand it. But I was tormented by such extreme and utter boredom page by tedious page 2 years ago that I still loathe it with a vigorous passion.The best experience I had with Dandelion Wine was using it to swat a particularily pesky mosquito."
5,A wonderful book,"The book Dandelion Wine was not only an interesting and readable book, it also had lessons for life in it. At first the book might be hard to get into if you are not used to Ray Bardburies style of writing. However, once you get past that, it is an excellent book that I would recomend to mature groups. It does take a degree of comprehention and anilitical skills. I personally enjoyed this book emencily and went on to read many others of Bradburies books which I equally enjoyed."
3,????A little confused????,I don't know about this book I haven't really read that far into it but as of now (chapter 5) it is so confusing to me. As a sophomore in high school I really am not sure if this book is for all ages. Personally this book has not appealed to me. I was assigned this book to read for a book report and I haven't found it too interesting yet. I suppose I should give it a little bit longer before I give it up. But as of now it has been very confusing. I think that the first few chapters are very hard to follow because Bradbury skips from one thing to the other in every different chapter.
2,"Literary genius, although a little boring","found this book to be very insightful and full of revelations. The only problem with the book is that the author tends to wander. He almost seems to be trying to fill page at times. The descriptions that he provides are very profound, but he takes them too far, often going to deep. This method is not a very popular one with younger readers, such as myself. Bradbury would sometimes take as much as a page just to explain how a cow pie smells to the main character, (an eight year old boy in the 1920's) who is far too young to have the ability to think as insightfully as Bradbury depicts him. Overall, not a very good book, and not one that I would recommend."
2,Dandelion Wine: A slight disappointment,"Dandelion Wine was too . . . real for my tastes. Most of Bradbury's works have a fairly unreal (not quite the word I'm looking for, but it'll do) taste, which is what attracts me. This is more of a real-life story."
2,DANDELION WINE,"THis book is a good book, but Bradbury spends so much time explaining the details he forgets about the plot. Each chapter really has nothing to do with the previous one."
1,The Critic on Dandelion Wine,"I was starting my summer school course and my teacher assigned the class to read""Dandelion Wine."" As I looked over the book and saw how every chapter had its own plot and didn't have anything to do with the chapter before it I though it would be a boring book. I was right the book must have been the most boring book I have ever read. First I didn't care of a boy who lived sixty years ago, for it had nothing to do with me. Second, the changing of plots in every chapter really confused me and I couldn't keep up with it. Last, when I took the test I did bak because the book bad on meaning to me. For any normal person I do not recommend reading this book."
1,A must not read,From the very start this book was confusing. The author had not been very clear on the setting. The book was skipping around to much. It never stayed or talked about one or a few main events throughout the book. It was a good book to read in the summer. It had the right words and summer type theme. But that was not enough to convice me that the book was good. If your into action pack type books then this book isn't the right book for you.
1,Not very interesting.,"When i first saw the cover of the book, i thought to myself, this book looks like it's going to be boring, but i remebered not to judge a book by its cover, so read the first 4 chapters, and it actuaully was boreing, i wanted to stop reading the book because i didnt find it interesting, and their were parts in the book that tried to get the readers attention, like when the mom and her son look for Doug in the woods, and the thought the were getting chased by the ""lonely one"", when i first read that chapter i thought hey, this might get interesting, but i was wrong, it was boreing. I would of stoped reading this book if i could, but my teacher made me. I wouldent recomend this book to the younger readers, because me as a young reader found it really boreing, but praubably the older readers will enjoy for whatever reson."
5,Vintage book for reading season,"Dandellion Wine was a wonderful book to read. Keeping the reader entertained in every chapter, Ray Bradbury emits the wonders of a irregular summer of a boy named Douglas in the vintage season of 1928. With the many subplots including the ""green machine,"" and a murderer called the ""lonely one,"" Bradbury gives the reader both excitment and drama throughout the story. I was assigned this book for summer reading, and I accepted it reluctanly, not knowing what a great opportunity I was given. This book can relate to the young reader in many ways, and it is a great book for almost all ages."
3,Dandelion Wine Review,"Dandelion Wine is about the author's memories as a child. Ray Bradbury put together this book of summer memories. It is a book full of different stories. The numerous metaphors and twists and turns make it a little confusing and tedious to read. Slow at times, Dandelion Wine is not a bad pick."
3,Dandelion Wine,Dandelion Wine is greatly exhibited through its pages. Each vignette has a moral to life. I enjoyed the characters immensly although Dandelion Wine is not one of my favorites. From within each story I saw similarities in my own life. Dandelion wine is an interesting yet choppy adventure.
4,Dandelion Wine,Ordered these books for a teenagers summer reading project. This was the only place that I could find all the ones she needed. Inexpensive and fast deliver.
5,My Favorite Novel,I first read Dandelion Wine when I was in high school. I've read it again and again over the years. It's my favorite novel by my favorite writer. The book is pure magic.
4,Dandelion Wine,"I thought this book by Ray Bradbury was very well written. I especially like how Bradbury used description in his writing. It made the book come alive and kept me interested. There were some very confusing points that kept me from giving this book a better rating, but that is the only reason. The way he wrote some of the parts makes you wonder if he was often speaking of his own childhood and relaying it to you through this novel. It seems that he had a childhood much like any other kid. I found numerous situations that I was able to relate with and really get a sense of what the character was feeling. Overall, this book is a great read. If you want to try and bring back memories of your past summers, or get away from the horrible weather of Western New York this book is great for that."
2,Not my Cup of Tea,"Dendelion Wine is a fond, semi- biographical reminiscence of Ray Bradbury's youth in small town Illinois in the sumer of 1928. I can see why it's highly regarded- it is very well written, and evokes a definite sense of nostalgia and childhood wonder. But this type of book is not really my cup of tea, and I found it vey slow going."
2,A Bit Boring,"I found this book to be interesting at times, but then it would go on for a chapter about absolutely nothing. I think that with a few minor changes I'd like it a lot more. I liked the theme of life but sometimes the theme would make you think a little too much and start to get confusing. Some things that the auther would say, I'm sure made good sence to him, but when i read it, it would make me insane. This book is for someone who likes fiction, someone who likes books that make you think. But me I like non-fiction books better, to me they are more interesting. So if you are like me and dont like fiction i highley don't reccomend this book."
2,Dandelion Wine,"Dandelion Wine is a book. It's not a bad book, it's not a good book. It's just a book. I personally think that the book lacked excitement and a plot that was less than sufficient. This book did not appeal to me in any way shape or form. Someone may find interest in this book though. If you care about feeling alive and how it affects you and summer rituals, I highly suggest this book to you. If those do not apply, I would try to avoid this book."
2,Hopeless Reading in Summer School,"Well, this is a story that I have read in summer school this year. It is definitely not one of my favorite books. Although, the writing is very good and there is a lot of description, I still don't like the plot of the story. I cannot read a sentence with out five lines of description before the sentence is over. So it is very tedious for me to understand. Also, I am an aficionado of murder mysteries, so this is certainly not the book for me. It lies on the line between boring and annoying. As a 17 yr. old I don't find a point to reading and besides that when I am forced to read a book in school, I 99% of the time dislike the book. I feel that this may be a good book for someone who prefers descriptive, obtuse writing or if they like the summer. But 2 stars are better than 1."
2,Wierd book,"I read this book for school, and i really didnt think it was that great. Im not a big reader in the first place, but this book didnt catch my eye. I thought it was to detailed and had to many similies and metaphors. It seemed like he never got to the point of the story. Im not writing this to tell you not to read it but to me it wasnt a very good book."
2,Hard going due to personal taste,"I'm a new fan of Bradbury. I love the incomparable Something Wicked This Way Comes and a whole heap of his short stories, The Illustrated Man and Golden Apples of the Sun to name my favourites so far.I came to Dandelion Wine expecting to be mesmerised, but sadly, I just found the book was too easy to put down and rather hard to pick up again. There are some great ideas and interesting imagery, but the whole lacks a narrative thread to entice more thrill-seeking readers, and in the end, after four of five chapters, I just found the whole thing a little...well, dated.In no way should this put people off Ray Bradbury. Those seeking a semi-romance about the state of childhood could do worse than to read Dandelion Wine. For me though, I much prefer his fantastical and dark works, and in the end, Dandelion Wine became too sweet and cloying for my tastes."
4,Confusing but Interesting,"I thought this book was confusing, because of the fact that every chapter is different. Also, I think this book is not that elabrate. It doesn't continue telling much detail about events that happen. On the other hand, I like how the book is about the author, Ray Bradbury, and he tells his life in the summer of 1928. I think it is interesting, in that it some parts reflect how I grew up, discovering things or realizing things"
5,Excellent Book,"This book about the young Douglas, describes the ideal summer of 1928. From a ghostly lonely one, to the idea of discoering one is alive, is incredible. I am a ninth grader from W-, Ma., and this is one of the best books I have ever read. Ray Bradbury is an excellent author, who can write about a 12-year-old very well. This book takes place in the summer of 1928. Douglas Spalding is a very interesting character, along with many of the other characters from the book. Each one has its own personality, luring a reader into this great book. I recommend this book to anyone who wants an easy-reading, fun book."
2,Overrated,"This was way too poetic for my tastes. Never thought I would yearn for the clipped writing of Hemingway, but this is so ponderous and overwritten I had to put it down. I get the drift, he is coming of age and seeing the world with new eyes but Good Lord, could he tighten it up a bit?My daughter has to read it for freshman Honors English this summer. What a bad start to high school. This is a book only an English Lit major could love. Trying to find the Cliff's Notes, but alas, there are none."
3,lori's review,"This wasn't the best book I have ever read, but it was ok. I didn't think they did a good job of introducing the characters because I couldn't get a visual picture of Doug and Tom in my head, which I felt would have made the begining of the book especially easier to read. By the time I got to the end though, the theme I realized was very important and I thought it was a great lesson! If the begining of this book was a little more exciting then I probably wuld have liked it a lot better."
3,A mediochre book on the part of Ray Bradbury.,"Over the summer I was assigned to read Dandelione Wine, by Ray Bradbury. When I was reading this book I don't think I was in the right frame of mind to fully understand the book. I am not familiar with the complexities of science fiction writing. I thought the green machine was a real hovering craft, little did I know, it was apart of Doug's imagination. I could not identify with Doug because we live in two different time periods. Our lifestyles are the complete opposite. His life was so simple and ours is so diverse and complex. He lived on a farm and that is impossible for me to imagine. I really did not enjoy this book, but I intend to re-read this book in the future and try to see what I missed."
3,Dandelion Wine-Not a Favorite,"In Dandelion Wine, by Ray Bradbury, many stories take place but all revolve around the same group of people and the same town. The main character, Douglas, goes through some tough times which Bradbury portrays well. However, there seem to be too many different storylines which makes this book a little too complicated. At times also I got extremely bored with it, hoping something new would happen soon."
3,Andrew's Review,"I had to read Dandelion Wine by Ray Bardbury for my college class and write a review, so here it is. I know some people thought this was a good book but at times it was slow. I often felt bored reading this book and only skimmed over the pages I had to read for class. I do give the author credit for making me think back to my childhood. After reading this book, I remembered the good times when I was little, and how I miss living life carefree. I did, however, like some parts of the book. I loved it when Ray used suspense in his book. Ray Bradbury brilliantly wrote about the lonely one and he kept me at the edge of my chair hoping that Lavinia gets back to her home safely. All in all the book wasn't that bad."
5,Bittersweet to the last...,"It's rather sad that our newest generation, weened on video games and bad movies, cannot relate to the bittersweet memories that Bradbury is able to so eloquently describe through the course of this novel. This work is a time capsule, a fragment of an innocent age lost when one grows up - and an age that today's youths cannot grasp or understand.The book itself is written with a dazzling sense of rythmn and pacing, flowing more like poetry than prose. The stories themselves are like memories of events you've never shared in, yet can relate to instinctively. It's a masterwork through and through, and is probably the best of Bradbury's vast library. I heartily recomend this to anybody with a soul."
4,Dandelion Wine,"Fiction. Dandelion Wine had its ups and downs. An up that got me excited was when Douglas was talking about a hidden creature in the forrest that was watching Douglas and Tom. This got me interested in the book. Then the book took a turn for the worse by describing about how Douglas, Tom and the rest of the family make their wine. The whole wine sceen was really boring for me. Then BAM! The story takes you in with informing you about the rituals preformed during their summer. I could really relate to this part of the book, because I had some of the same summer rituals. So if you like fiction books and you can relate to them easily, read this book!"
3,The Tastes of Summer!!,"Granted Bradbury wrote a story people can relate to. A Decriptive journal/ log of a childhood summer. The taste, smell, and the sights of a normal summer are contained in this book. Brabury took Summer and jarred it up like preserves. He pulls the Summer out of the jar (his memory) at any time he likes. Bradbury even gave us a taste of the Dandelion Wine on a hot steamy, sunny day. From the minted taste of deviled ham sandwiches in the woods, on the trail to the smell of Ms. Brown's iodined finger it is very detalied, yet some what confusing because a lack of orgainization, but what do you expcet from a little boys journal in the summer he writing and his mind is on so many events occuring in front of him. (smile)"
4,makes you think of your younger days,"Dandelion wine by Ray Bradbury, was different from the usual books that i read. At times it was hard to read because of the way it jumped around from topic to topic. Overall i liked the book it reminded me of the things that i look forward to when it is summer time. some parts of the book seemed to drag on but it kept me interested for the most part. otherwise i liked the overall plot of the book but the only thing that i did not like was the organization. after getting past the organizational issue i enjoyed the book, it made me think of my childhood, with all the machines that the kids tried to make, because thats what i did when i was younger. It was an indirect way of making me think about the things that i did when i was younger because i was reading the book through the eyes of a 12 year old boy."
5,The Ideal Book for Summertime,"Even if you didn't grow up in 1928, this book will take you back to your days of childhood summers. I like it because it is not just a lot of sappy summer stories, but many different experiences that spark many different emotions. It's a good book for summer time."
3,Fair,"I found the novel Dandelion Wine to act a link between adulthood and childhood. Bradbury easily allows the reader to travel back in time through his memories. Some of the memories are universal for young children, this is one of the reasons that most people who read this novel find it easy to relate. The content of the book was somewhat thrown everywhere, and this made it difficult to put together. Overall this is a faily good read. I feel that an older person would gain the most from a novel like this. As a college student I have yet to part with many of my childhood memories, I don't feel that I need a novel to bring me back to them. The final observation that came from this book is that after a point in childhood people begin to see that life is real, and that it will never be the same as it was when we were kids."
2,I bought this stroller from amazon about 6 months ago..,"It's the same exact stroller pictured here except that when i bought my stroller they called it ""cosco juvenile stroller"". The stroller started out great but about 3 months ago the front right wheel stopped touching the ground for no apparent reason.So now all the other wheels work while the front right one just hovers about 2 inches above the sidewalk, i can't use the stroller anymore unless i can figure out how to fix it.. if not i have to junk it & buy another stroller.I'm very dissapoiinted in this stroller!"
5,Greatest Band - Greatest Album Ever!,"I bought this CD right after its release. At first I felt not so great love for the album, but gradually I got stuck to it. Especially when I broke up with my girlfriend, I found JBJ the most closest ""friend"" by soul. I wish I had his exciting voice and could scream his every song in this album to my ex-girlfriend wherever she is now! Guys, if you're in love with a wonderful girl and at the same time if your soul is bound with rock'n'roll - you cannot find anything else you could live with!!! Just get this greatest ever band's greatest ever album! I would give this album 10 stars!!!"
5,Best Bon Jovi album EVER,"This is hands down the best album Bon Jovi has done in their long and illustrious career. This album stood out and proved that they were not going to fade like so many 80's bands. If you want to know why Bon Jovi is still great today...this is the album that lead to that. I was really into grunge, Pearl Jam is still my alltime favourite, but this made me a Bon Jovi fan for life."
5,Father's Day Gift,"My Dad loves 'Engelbert Live'!!! He is so glad I picked it out for him. It reminds of the good times that he had with my mom, who has passed away, in Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada."
1,Ashton Digital Worst Company,We bought a laptop from them in August 04. The thing blew up immediately afterward. I am the technical liason for my department (355 computers). I have worked with computers for 12 years and I have a masters degree in computer science. I have never seen this poor (nonexistent) level of support. Try it. Go to www.ashtondigital.com and click on support. You'll see what I mean.
2,Too big and too soft,"I have to agree with the other reviewer that said they are just too big and too soft. They leave a slimy taste in the mouth, even though the flavor is good. There is no bite to it, it is sort of a spam consitency. I love this brand, and usually love smoked sausage sticks/bites, but this just did not come to gether well."
3,Join the Chub Club,"You know how in movies and on TV, when a person is murdered and thrown into the river, they come out all bloated and water logged? The Jack Link's Lil Chub"" is essentially a Slim Jim that was murdered and thrown into the river. Wouldn't you know it after a few hours it came out bloated, soft, and a little rounder than it should be.Of course the Lil Chub isn't all bad. Just one of these things at a party provides a whole night of endless jokes and witty banter. The Lil Chub is also pretty much the definition of great white elephant gift exchange gift. And with Valentine's right around the corner, this could be the key to that special someone's heart...and maybe more!"
2,Misleading,When I ordered these tapes I thought I was getting 2 tapes at the price I paid because of the picture shown and the other manufactures 2 pack for sale at a comprable price. Such was not the case. I received only 1 tape at the price I paid and it seems I would have had to double my cost to get 2 tapes shown in the ad picture although it was not stated as such in the ad. The 2 tape pack picture shown is very misleading since the other manufacturers comprable 2 pack would have cost less then purchasing these as a 2 pack from this company.
3,"Good food, bad packaging.","Pretty much everything under this brand name suffers from over-packaging: There's a ton of wasted material outside the heat-sealing, and way too much empty space inside, even after adding the indicated amount of water. Also, the claim of ""Serves two"" is fanciful at best - I (an athletic 70kg female) could easily polish one of these off by myself after a day of even moderate activity.What's inside this package is pretty much the best you're going to get out of readily-available dehydrated food, though - good texture, decent (if overly sugary) flavor, 100% edible either cooked or dry, nothing to complain about aside from the complete lack of veggies (Not that I'm implying these should be balanced for long term consumption. Just saying it'd be nice to see some green in there.)"
4,better than you would think,My son loved it on our campout. Several other people had the same flavor and all agreed it was very good and plenty for one person.
4,Not bad!,Not bad at all I must say... rehydrates back properly and tastes pretty good. Tastes just as good as some stir frys you get in the store... I give it four stars!
1,"Advertised to receive 6, only got one","The description of this product was misleading. It indicated that I would receive a case of 6 and I only received one. With an ""original price"" of $45.00, this also assured me that this must be for a case of 6."
1,"None of us liked it, but the flies sure did!","The Chicken Teriyaki with Rice was one of the entrees sampled recently at a camping club taste test. Unfortunately, it ranked the lowest of all of the entrees. Nobody liked it.It had a sweet taste with an odd, off flavor. Both the appearance and the texture were unappealing, the flavor even less appealing. (It looks like something your dog yakked up.) The only thing drawn to it was the flies, which at least kept them away from more desirable dishes. We all thought it was awful, and none of us will be willing to carry this around with us for a future meal.Pass on this one, there are much better Mountain House meals than this glop."
2,Not As Useful (Or Fun) As I'd Hoped,"As a self-proclaimed USB gadget geek, I thought this light would be useful for traveling. Unfortunately, the neck length makes transportation difficult because it fairly long and must be stored straight or awkwardly bent. Depending on your USB port arrangement, it can be difficult to position without interfering with more critical equipment (like a mouse).It also turns out the light itself isn't even value-added because most laptop monitors provide enough light - even in a pitch black room. From yet another functional angle, I've found that the only reason I use a laptop in a dark room is because I need the room to be dark (for watching movies, or not disturbing someone's sleep). Unfortunately, this LED light is bright enough to disturb the people next to you.Overall, I find this USB LED Light awkward to carry and use. It's a waste of a USB port."
3,Informative,"Keating provides a great deal of information and sound support for his writing. I found his academic tone to be a bit offensive at times and, quite honestly, a turn off."
4,An Integral Part of any Catholic's library,"As usual, Karl Keating articulates what many Catholics can't -- the reasons behind the beliefs of Catholicism. To be a truly educated Catholic, you must understand the answers to the 52 questions posed."
4,Short & Concise Catholic Apologetics,"An all-around decent and easy to understand apologetics book that teaches basic truths of the Catholic faith. Keating has a very ""no nonsense"" style of writing -- he tells the truth like it is and does not worry about what one may think. For this book's purposes, his voice works well to defend Catholic customs and beliefs that have been under attack by various groups.While I personally like Keating, I wouldn't necessarily recommend him immediately to someone who knows absolutely nothing about Catholicism or to those who aren't open-minded towards it. There are other authors who can introduce you to the truths of Catholicism in a gentler yet, honest tone. Rather, I would recommend this to Catholics seeking to understand traditions in their faith better as well as those who take issue with Catholic beliefs and seek a very basic understanding of why we believe what we do."
5,Look Here,Hi! I am thinking about changing religons to become catholic and a lady at the catholics shop gave me this book. I have read through it and it is the best! it cleared up of ton of the questions i had like why do catholics pray to mary? ro do they realy? any way hope this help
3,"52 Basics, not enough detail","As a 23 year-old life-long Catholic, I thought many of the _misconceptions_ were surprising! I found myself asking, ""Who would ever believe such a thing about Catholic faith?"" This book clears up some MAJOR misconceptions people may have. It would do wonders for any Catholic who has stopped growing/learning in their faith since they were young, and any non-Catholic who has heard some crazy rumors about what Catholics believe. But I must say many explanations seemed more about confirming what Catholics believe or do not believe instead of why or where a given tradition originated. It is a good place to start though."
4,"Good, quick-hit Catholic Apologia","I thought this book was well done. It isn't written as an in-depth study of every issue someone might have with Catholicism, but it covers some of the biggest myths and shibboleths and gives solid, if brief, answers to the questions raised.I wouldn't recommend it to someone doing a scholarly study, but for someone new to the church, or considering taking the leap and joining RCIA, I think it's perfect to demonstrate that there are indeed answers to the attacks that are so common nowadays from (sadly) some protestants that should know better and especially the secular media.I'm taking one star because I think it could have been written in a more friendly style to the less sophisticated reader."
4,Brief but Informative,"Karl Keating has done a good job at taken the most common misconceptions that people have about the Catholic Church and placed it in an easy to find format. This book is perfect if you have not studied Catholic Doctrine. It will help you understand Catholics if your Protestant; and if Catholic it will be of aid in helping you answer the most common questions you will be asked by non-Catholics.He starts off with a small quiz in the front of the book. To show how little everyone who picks the book up really knows about Catholic Doctrine. If he was trying to prove his point, I think he chose the wrong questions. They were all too easy to answer correctly. But I got his point.I do recommend that all Christians, or anyone who wants to understand the Catholic Faith, pick up this book that has not studied doctrine."
1,Disappointing,"I was brought up Catholic but was looking for some clarification and wanted many ""why"" questions answered. I didn't learn anything I didn't already know, which I didn't feel was a whole lot to begin with.I found Keating to be defensive. His book was, for lack of a better term, ""Catholic Propaganda"". I felt like he was saying ""Catholics are the best"" without explaining himself.This book would not help a non-Catholic understand the Catholic Religion at all. I was hoping my husband who is not Catholic could read this and answer some of his questions, I didn't bother giving it to him to read. He'd just have more questions that I couldn't answer."
3,Good for Catholics only,"I received this as a gift and read it cover to cover the first day. As a practicing Catholic, I nodded in agreement quite often. However, it seemed to have a negative connotation toward other religions and an almost superior attitude. Although I believe my religion is the true faith, I have tolerance toward others, as Vatican II promoted in Nostra Aetate. For example, on page 29, the author says ""the Bible is a Catholic book written for Catholics..."" This may tend to alienate someone of another faith that may be reading this. While its origins may be so, it could have been written in a more gentle manner.Ultimately, though, this book offers insight into many Catholic Traditions and traditions, and is worthwhile reading."
1,Soundbite Heavy/SubstanceLite,"This book is very easy to read and does outline the basic misconceptions about the Catholic church. Unfortunately, it offers little in the way of substance -- of the ""why"" the misconception is wrong based on biblical and/or Church documents. In short, it's great if what you want is a list of misconceptions. But -- if you're looking for real meat -- the real reason (and source of the reason) for the true Catholic belief to respond to the misconceptions, look elsewhere."
3,For Catholics and Non-Catholics Alike,"I found this book to be very good. 52 (arbitrary number, but a good start!) points of belief which answer questions often raised in the believer. I detected no doctrinal errors. (Although I am strictly an amateur--I am no Church authority, I freely admit!)This is an excellent resource for those with questions about the Faith, especially those who have to answer questions from family/friends/coworkers, etc.It includes Bible references on many points, and also references Magisterial documents and explains some of their salient points.This is also an excellent resource for those outside the Faith who want to know what Catholics believe and why. It's like apologists say, ""it doesn't bother me if you disagree with what I believe--PLEASE, just disagree with what I ACTUALLY believe and not what you may mistakenly THINK I believe!"""
2,kinda thin,"though simple and clear, and orthodox, I found Karl's book a little superficial and random in what he picks to talk about. I found Peter Kreeft's 'fundamentals of the faith' a better apologetics intro to Catholicism; more succint, yet more complete and methodical, with better analogies and rhetoric. Karl's other book 'catholicism and fundamentalism' is better--it has some good warnings of common fundamentalist tactics and source material. It seems a lot better researched and thorough. His magazine, 'this rock' I can heartily reccommend to all budding apologists."
3,Very Basic Introduction to RCC Beliefs.,"Exellent resource for the untechnical study group or for someone brand new to Roman Catholicism. If you are looking for a deeper work on the theological foundations of Roman Catholicism you can do no better than the Official Catechism of the Church (2nd edition) or even from a shorter standpoint, Kevin Johnson's ""Why do Catholic's do that""?"
4,Fascinating,"Fascinating if you're into this kind of thing - maps, history, old/new contrasts. A nice companion to 'Barmi', but get 'Barmi' if you're only getting one of these books."
4,A Good Effort,"This book will certainly change the way you train for the better.Props to Mr. Douillard for seeing through the heavy fog and attacking old problems in new ways.The main technique used is actually an age old Yoga Pranayama (breathing exercise and control),called Ujayi, that is not adequately explored in this book.This technique, features heavily in Ashtanga Yoga, in order to deal with the same kind of aerobic loads.So it's not a new discovery but it can still revolutionize your training.And those who wish to inquire further can try David Swenson's Ashtanga books and videos and BKS Iyengar's book, Light On Pranayama."
3,Not what I was looking for,This book focused soooo heavily on nasal breathing - which is not the mind body sport connection I as looking for - I didn't finish it - If you are looking for something about benefits of nasal breathing this is your book.
5,phenomenal training program,"I run, cycle, I'm a martial artist and a yoga teacher, and when I found this book I was so excited to find an intelligent training program from someone who had really done his research. What he teaches matches what I learned about mind/body connection over the years in martial arts/yoga, and he explains why it works, and what is going on in your bodily systems. This will change your training and exercise from exhaustion/pain to bliss, but also, it can change your life. Athletes, coaches, yoga teachers, READ THIS BOOK!"
4,Lucky ELO!,"This compilation does a good job of gathering the highlights of ELO. As with all anthologies, you can argue about what songs should or shouldn't have been included,but nevertheless a well chosen and thorough collection. The most promising thing is the great sound quality of these recordings. I really hope Rhino puts together a Deep Purple anthology like this one. Two jam packed CD's from the ""classic"" Purple lineup. One greatest hits disc is NOT enough and the 4 disc set is too expensive.This is a very reasonably priced and well put together collection!"
2,"Fire On high, missing? (!!)","ELO is one band of a kind, this compilation is good, but has amajor flaw, the forgot to include ELO's master introduction ""Fire Om High"". This is CD Collection is not the best of ELO or is incomplete."
3,DO YOURSELF A FAVOR!!!!!!!!!!!,"This collection is not worth it at all, Please do Yourself a favor and Go buy all the studio albums from third day to secret messages and you won't be disappointed their are too many awesome gems on the studio releases plus you can get a real sense of time and progression, so please buy the albums, this is too much money for a greatest hits cd.out of the blue is better and that's only one album."
2,"Great music, terrible audio","By 1995, most vintage, a.k.a ""dinosaur"", rock, began receiving much needed remaster makeovers. So, in 1995, ELO didn't make the cut, until 2001 when Legacy by way of Epic by way of Sony decided to remaster and re-release ELO's classic albums and compile a single CD retrospective entitled ""The Essential ELO"", which really isn't all that essential. Without the necessary makeover/remaster, ""Strange Magic"" resonates mostly tape hiss and two-dimensional phonics; therefore, this is not the CD master any casual or any dedicated fan should be seeking.If you enjoy much of ELO's popular singles and wish to try a more aesthetic studio outing, then begin with the beautiful and wistful ""Eldorado"" (1974). Although lacking in sonic perfection yet harnessing great material, ""Strange Magic"" is more intended for those listening to CDs on a budget-priced boombox."
2,Disappointed with the Snapper,"I found that unless you were strong as an ox, it was difficult to pull back the snapper. If you very strong you got a hole or two. Overall, it really doesn't do the job. I have arthritis and was so excited to find it, but it just isn't for me."
4,The Normans,"I wanted this book for a college course I am taking to connect the Normans with their Viking roots. Often history books overlook a Viking heritage as they often assimilated into the culture they conquered. However, the Normans does not loose that connection. The author writes well and keeps your interest - as Medieval lives often have a significant amount of ""soap opera"" drama. The author does an excellent job of keeping track of genealogy, so if that is an important aspect for you as a reader, he does deliver. He also keeps good track of the primary and secondary sources along with the biases that are prevalent even with historians who try to record just the facts."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,Just rented this movie from redbox. Terrible. It's not worth the $1 I paid to rent it. I wouldn't even rent it if it were free. I wish I could give it negative stars.
1,Lies and Illusions,"2 great actors for such a very poor film, thin story line totaly boring going nowhere, can say much more than that only that I wish I could get my money back!!!!."
1,Day Light Robbery,"This is the worst piece of cinemarphotgrapy I have ever seen. There should be a law pasted stopping such trash being sold on the open market. Christin Slater would be out acted by a wooden door, in this movie, he should go back to delivering post not lines in movies, the man cannot act, apart from looking stupid and out of his depth.What was Cuba doing in thi s movie?, only he can tell, please you are far better than this sad sad movie. The only say grace was the beautiful blonde who tired to raise the standard of acting, but failed.One movie to bury and forget, but make sure it is deep hole."
1,I've seen a lot of bad movies and this is in the 10 ten list,"Terrible in almost every imaginable way - acting, plot, score, directing. Unimaginably bad....you have been warned."
1,Return this movie to the video store immediately!,"I tried my best to watch this movie to it's bitter end, but had to give up. Christian Slater and Cuba Gooding Jr. would have done adequate jobs if they were directed properly. An interesting plot with talented (at least one) actors undone by bad acting, a poor screenplay and production. If you must see this movie for educational purposes -- rent, don't buy. You have been warned."
1,B Movie too good of a rating,There was nothing redeemable about this movie. Just plain bad - don't waste your time!
1,Do yourself a big favor and pass on this,"A quarter of the way through this movie my wife asked me why we were wasting our life watching it. Unfortunately I said we should stick with it to see what happens, and all that happened was pure sillyness. I can't believe these actors would be part of something like this!"
1,MISERABLE excuse for a movie!!,"This is, hands down, the worst movie I've had the misfortune to put in my DVD player!! I completely agree with the reviewer that shames the two actors for allowing themselves to be on film, NOT ACTING! High school one act plays have more guts than this, with better acting, better dialogue and better scripts! Billed as comedy/thriller? I think not! No comic relief from any of the performers...they deliver their lines like they were reading for an audition and not a good one at that! I had to take the movie out when I heard ""I'm just a writer!"" for the umpteenth time!! If this is the best you can do, Cuba and Christian, you either need new agents or new careers. The rest of the cast?? You don't even belong on the extra list! The baddie with having a bad hair day?? Worse than bad! Wish there were a 1/2 star! Even that is too much! If you have a choice between this movie and a root canal? Opt for the root canal....at least you get anesthetic with that!"
1,Terrible!!,"I would have expected alot more from Christian Slater and Cuba Gooding, Jr. I think my jaw was on the ground the whole time watching this movie thinking can this be real..The acting was horrible and the two women in the movie are definately B rated movie actresses. I was excited to see this movie because of Christian and Cuba and was very dissapointed. Im still in shock.."
1,Just 'HORRIBLE'!!!,"I was really looking forward to seeing a half-way decent movie with Christian Slater. It is a toss-up between Christen Slater and Cuba Gooding, Jr., as to WHO was the WORSE!! The acting was horrible, the story-line was even worse. I am sitting here shaking my head, thinking these two actors have really hit rock-bottom. Poor things!Don't waste your money or your precious time on this piece of JUNK!"
1,The worst movie I have ever seen,Shame on Slater and Gooding for appearing in such a dog of a movie..Its almost unwatchable the acting is so terrible..This is the very bottom of the heap for movies I have seen..Don't waste your time on money on this travesty of a movie.
1,I was fooled by the redbox writeup,It is movies like this that make me think I will never rent another movie without reading a review. The best part of this movie was reading all the negative reviews after the fact. Some of them are hilarious. Thank you reviewers for being the bright spot in this movie experience.
1,Is this a joke?,"Gak! I stopped watching after a half-hour and thank goodness it was a rental. It's not only an obvious plot, but even the bass playing was a rip-off."
3,It's o.k...,"Not impressed with the entire movie at all. It had its moments, but then it was blah, blah, blah, blah, blah - go figure. Don't waste buying the blu-ray format, stick to the dvd."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"Do not waste your time or money, one of the worst movies I've seen in years, Gooding and Slater used to be actors, what happened?"
1,Comedy? Serious?????,The whole movie I am wondering if this is a comedy or a serious movie. Either way it was lousy. What a total waste of time and money. I would rather dig a ditch and then fill it.
1,Worst movie of the year,You would expect more from this cast of characters but this is easily the worst movie I've seen all year. Not worth spending a single dime on this horrible film. Unfortunately I can't give this review less than a single star.
1,Lies and Illusions,"This movie is sooo awful I had to finish watching it. Highly recommended for the college crowd that wants to get high, order papa johns and pass out on their couch."
1,Worst Movie Ever!!!,"Calling this a ""festering turd of a movie"" is being way too kind. I am more stupid for having watched it :( Cuba and Slater's careers are obviously over..."
2,"A waste of time. Buy the ""Complete Hank Williams"" set","Hank was country's greatest singer and ranks with Frank Sinatra in the popular music field. Even the out-of-print ""40 Greatest Hits"" (a fantastic set) did not do him justice. Go ahead and buy the ""Complete Hank Williams"" 10-c.d. set. He's WORTH it! Besides, prices are firming up, a limited number were produced, and you can pass it down to your descendents. For them, listening to old Hank will be almost as earth-shaking as listening to a speech by George Washington or Abraham Lincoln."
3,this is a subject wich represent a biig interress for MI,THIS SUBJECT IS THE MAIN EF MY PHD AND I WANT TO REWIEW I
3,weak but decent in a few parts,"Fletch finds out the hard way he has a long-lost son when the latter (plus three other escaped felons) barge in and make themselves home.The attempt is there, but the book just doesn't work for me. The beginning requires way too much suspension of disbelief, and the whole thing rather reeks of contrived effort. Also (and this is a minor gripe) this is probably the first Fletch book where he doesn't try to solve a murder. Still, it had a few chuckles and other aspects we've come to expect from the author.Didn't love it, didn't hate it."
3,"A little bit Fletch, a little bit Jack","Not the best Fletch novel by far, but not bad. The witty dialogue is there, and Fletch is at the top of his game as a reporter (in this book he works for a cable company). I can't say as I liked the son's character, Jack, nearly as much as I like Fletch--the teaser of Fletch, Resurrected at the end, which seems to focus solely on Jack, left me a little dry. The biggest problem with this book is the wishy-washy end. It just kind of sputters out. But like I said, Fletch is so much fun to follow around it almost doesn't matter."
2,A major disappointment,"I think McDonald was mailing it in by this point. There are elements in the beginning of this book which are enticing as any in a McDoanld book. But he seemed to be running downhill with no way to stop after awhile. Predictable bad guys, unbelievably snarled death traps (of course Fletch escapes them all) and a much more holier-than-thou attitude by Fletch's alter-ego (and love interest) than anyone could tolerate all make this a waste of money, even at 3 bucks on a used book sale. DON'T WASTE YOUAR TIME EXPECTING QUALITY. It ain't here."
2,"""Too Feeble""","I'm a Dahl fan, but this odd little volume (published to commemorate the author's 70th birthday) has to be one of his least interesting works. The two parables, ""The Princess and the Poacher"" and ""Princess Mammalia,"" are aimed at mature readers rather than children, but lack the wit and imagination usually found in Dahl's stories. A disappointment. Recommended for Dahl completists only."
4,"not ange's best,but cool none-the-less.","the themes here are pretty basic.i think the second composer must've added -in the electronics,because they often conflict with ange's work.good disc for halloween,or the badalamenti completist.not ""bad"" by all means though!"
4,A mixed bag from an old Nashville insider,"After a brief run of midlevel hits in the early '80s, songwriter Keith Stegall settled into a comfortable mode as a top producer, working with numerous artists, many with a rootsy bent to their work. This solo album opens with a great uptempo number, ""Roll The Dice,"" then settles into a series of slower, sappier ballads, with skillful yet strained accompaniment. When the next honkytonkish song comes up, ""Every Time It Rains,"" it seems clear that Stegall's real strength lies as a full-throated hard county singer -- he's got a great voice for the material, but he kinda loses you on the slower stuff. Still, since he wrote most of these songs himself and produced the album, it's kind of hard to blame its shortcomings on ""them"" -- Stegall's a Nashville man, and shares Music City's shortcomings, even on his own albums. Sure do like them two songs, though!"
3,Sensitive skin,"The reason why I still am giving it a three star is because it covers okay under the eyes. I might just have super sensitive skin but my whole face broke out very bad just after two uses. I have rashes on my cheeks and tiny pimples all over my forehead after using this. I'm really sad because I thought this would be great for me, I would say don't purchase this if you have sensitive skin."
4,Second Skin,"This product is my go to, just a dab will do ya! It is very consentrated and a small, pea-sized amount will go a long way. The color is a perfect match to my skin tone and evens me out without concealer. Just a wonderful foundation/concealer overall."
5,The best I've ever had !!!,this product is so far the best concealer I have ever used. I have a beauty saloon and used toooooo many kinds of concealers with different prices from different brands. Nothing in the world could be like this. I strongly recommended it specially sx08 which goes with most of the medium skin tones. hope it will never discontinuied.
2,"is either I dont get how to use it, or it is really a waste of money","Alright, I bought this for its excellent review showing above, and I thought this maybe a miracle for my acne face. But, when i get this, i realized that the color is, at the first place, way too white for me. I am an asian women with a pretty light skin base (for asians)&#65292; and the SX02 color is still too light. I put it on with brushes on my face. The fact is, it WONT EVEN BLEND IN! It is super cakey and wont conceal my scars at all, then I thought I only use on my spots, not over the face, it still wont work! At last I figure out I might just mix it up with a moisturizer, it out after the mixing up it is barely a tinted moistrizer, no coverage at all! i wish i can send this back to the company."
5,JON CAN DO IT ALL,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST DVD'S I'VE PURCHASED IN A WHILE.JON LORD IS SUPER ON THE KEYBOARDS, BUT THATS NOTHING NEW. THE BAND HAS A GREAT SOUND. THE SHOW IS FILMED IN A CLUB CALLED THE BASEMENT. THE ATMOSPHERE IS 100%BLUES. I HOPE THESE GUYS DO ANOTHER PROJECT AND TOUR THE US (SO. FL.)"
3,Better Than I Had Expected,"Helena, mother of the emperor Constantine, is best known for her unaccompanied junket to the Holy Land, when she was about 76-80 years old. While there, she acquired what were represented to be relics of Christ's life, crucifixion, and resurrection (pieces of the True Cross, nails therefrom, etc.), which she dutifully sent back to Europe and Constantinople. Like modern day pilgrims to the Holy Land, she delighted in souvenirs. The fact that the Roman Army leveled Jerusalem in the Jewish War of 69 AD, thus making relics difficult to find, seems to have had little impact upon her credulity or that of the Readers Digest, which produced this film.Technically, the video is beautifully produced, and provides a nice tour of the Holy Land and some of its major sights, although the PBS ones are preferable.Gullible readers or those amused by relics, may wish to buyRelics: The Shroud of Turin, the True Cross, the Blood of Januarius...History, Mysticism, and the Catholic Church."
5,"A book that truly lives up to its ""tragic"" title","It is hard to imagine that such an terrible injustice could have occured in a country that prides itself on ""justice for all."" Dan Carter does a meticulous job in presenting us with one of the most engaging and informative books on the Scottsboro case I have ever read. As a pre-law and African-American history student I was thoroughly impressed and I recommend it to anyone regardless of their interests."
3,Tried & failed,I tried to read this but kept feeling very bogged down so I gave up. I'll have to look for another book about Charlemagne that is less dry.
1,Doesn't fit -- 2001 Honda CR-V,"Amazon said this product would work as a rear wiper for a 2001 Honda CR-V. Amazon was wrong -- the brackets on the wiper are too close to the pivot point when compared to the older version of the Bosch 13"" wiper."
2,Not what I wanted.,"If you just want the music and songs from the original TV cartoon, then don't buy this. It is the whole thing, including narration. I have the DVD-all I wanted was the songs. Very disappointed."
4,music,"Overall good product. Although, It does skip on my favorite song. I don't believe it's my stereo because my other CD's don't do that."
2,Hit Songs Are Included Only On A Medley,"I base my rating of two stars on the fact the group's hit songs such as Up Up And Away, Wedding Bell Blues, Acquarius/Let The Sun Shine In, and Stoned Soul Picnic are only very briefly sung with a few lines of each song. I bought the DVD with the idea they would sing the entire song, but was disappointed. If this doesn't bother you, I'm sure you will rate the DVD higher than I did."
4,The 5th Dimension take you away...,"...on a psychedelic post 60s trip full of innocence, kitsch, color and an everlasting smile on their faces. Stunning appearances by Dionne Warwick, Merle Haggard, the Carpenters and, of course, by the 5th themselves. There is and has never been a vocal group in pop history with a capability of creating wonderful, dense harmonies of such a technical brilliance! And this is the pure sound- without the gimmicks of modern music production like in today's casting groups. As natural, fresh and exciting as ever!Unfortunately, the DVD was obviously produced from a video tape- and has not gone through any digital remastering process. So the picture is not as brilliant as you would expect from a DVD, but good enough to watch (Therefore only 4 stars). Nevertheless, this DVD is recommended! Sit back and enjoy a colorful musical journey into the past..."
5,Features Karen Carpenter,I'll buy anything with Karen Carpenter pretty much... it's cool to see how the old TV shows were put together. Not the BEST DVD in the world. 5 stars come from Karen being featured.
2,"Meh, it's okay.","Fun and campy way to kill a little time without hurting anyone. Correction: The DVD lists one of the Carpenters' songs as ""Someone Like You,"" and I must say one of the reasons I purchased the DVD is that it appeared to contain a Carpenters song I'd not heard before. Alas, 'twas not to be. ""Someone Like You"" is actually the Carpenters cover of ""Reason To Believe,"" which was almost released as a single by A&M."
3,Terrible print,"This is a great show, but the video quality is pretty poor for the price. If they ever re-release this on video or DVD, they better come up with a better print. This wasn't worth the money I spent."
3,Realistic but Romantic,"Silver Nights is set in Russia, something I did not expect from Jane Feather, but seems well researched. Another change from her usual plotline is that the heroine, Sophie, must enter an arranged marriage even after she has met her lover. Unfortunately, they must commit adultery to be together. Usually, I dislike such plotlines, but the husband is shown to be a very realistically evil man and adultery and escape seem inevitable. The relationship between Adam and Sophia is written very well and Adam and Sophia are both strong and interesting characters. Unless a reader cannot get over the adultery aspect, this is a good read with wonderfully realistic emotion."
3,Most of my reviews are starting to sound the same!,"Another book that I found a chore to read although I kind of liked it at the end. Nothing really stands out but at the end of the book I was glad for the happily ever after since the two lead characters went through so much. I liked Sophia & her relationship with her grandfather. Some of the rest of the story was fun (the Russian history, even if I have no idea if it was correct or not) but it seemed to go on & on. I was glad to get to the end and start another book. Probably not one that will stay with me for long."
5,Excellent!,"This is one album that you'll get your money's worth out of. All of the tracks fantastic. You know how sometimes you buy a whole album and only listen to one song ? This is NOT one of those types of albums. I can listen to the whole album without skipping any. This album is filled with flavorful, melodic tracks. It is like R&B meets reggae/dancehall. Well produced...you won't regret it. I don't. ENJOY!"
4,Home for the Holidays Soundtrack,I love the movie Home for the Holidays and fell in love with the soundtrack. This was exactly what I wanted and at a great price.
1,"Some Good Ideas, But Overall Condescending","This book seems to pretend to be open-minded, while herding the reader in the direction the authors wish to go. The book also glosses over the idea that there are serious, unsolvable dilemmas, and instead gives examples of easily solved issues.A person facing severe, unremitting problems may feel trivialized by this book."
3,Good chocolate but.....,I received the chocolate bars with Orange flavor also. However a call to Amazon remedied the mistake.
4,on the best albums ever except songs are mixed up,This is one of the best albums ever. The sound quality is top notch. There only problem is with the cd version of this album. The songs are in a different order on the cd than they are on the case. If you dont know the songs yet this can be confusing.
4,Under rated classic rock,"Forever the underdogs of Grunge, Screaming Trees finally received the recognition they deserve with Dust, an album of quality over image. Gentler and less angst than their peers, the collection of ten fine songs has ""timeless"" written all over them. Still not household names, and probably never will be, many critics praised the album as a masterpiece on release with sandpaper vocals and wide range of instruments. This is most relevant on 'Sworn and Broken' with an unexpected harpsichord coming in. 'Look At You' is moving and inspired and 'Witness' could be considered the most upbeat number on offer. Never likely to break into the mainstream or be played on the radio, Dust is low key and relies on musicianship rather than the current embrace of technology."
5,good gRuNge,The Screaming Trees 's one of the biggest grunge band in Seattle and in this world. Is one of Screaming Trees best albums and definetly one of the best albums of all time. This album is great... life without this is empty... . .
5,A real favourite,"I have to agree with the other reviews here - this really is a masterpiece. This was the first album I'd heard from the Trees, and I was hooked ever since. It manages to amaze me each time I listen to it and discover something new. I bought this CD in the summer of '96 and I _still_ play it frequently now. Probably one of the finest records of the last decade!"
5,No Weaknesses,"I am a huge music fan, and my tastes are very eclectic. I rarely, however, can say that I love every single song on an album, but this album is an exception. The Screaming Trees have truly released one for the ages. This album is not one to put on as background music. When I listen to it, I listen from start to finish, and I love every minute of it. This is possibly the most under-appreciated rock album of this decade."
1,Good Music but i just received a BAD COPY (piracy),"I bought this CD about 2 months, and AMAZON says that the item was out of stock, so, I wait a month more... So today I just received this amazing disc and when I opened the package I realize the disc is a copy!!! Oh my! I opened the case, and the CD has an ugly (very ugly) printed desing with the logo of SONY MUSIC, it has no booklet and when I turn the disc... God it's not even a reissued version, it is a COPY!!! (the finished in the disc it's not silver, more like a greenish shine)I only ask WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY DISC! It's not fair, and it's not just for the price ($10) It's about trust and the image of an international company... Just let me know what happened... Can I return it?"
5,Criminally underrated....,"I bought this CD used for $3 knowing what a great song ""Nearly Lost You"" was and figuring their later stuff might be as good. Little did I know that I had stumbled onto one of the best CDs I have heard in years! How were these guys not huge? Buy it and love it!"
5,Achingly beautiful,"This is sublime. It is a remarkably fine recording of pure, generous, fluid choral music."
3,Only moderately helpful,"I have worked from my own home office for over 5 years and I'm always looking for clever ideas for making my space my productive and pleasant. I was disappointed with this book. It is a showcase for the author's home office, which involved construction and landscaping. I am of more modest means, and I was looking for very PRACTICAL ideas. The tone of the book is more of ""look at what a wonderful job I have done"" and while the author's office is nice, it is not the kind of project I have in my near future. If you are just thinking about your first home office and you would like someone to explain the basics, this would be a good starter book. But even the technology and equipment information is out of date -- those things change so fast! As long as you don't expect too much, this has some good information."
3,A Book of Old Age But New!,A new book was writtten about Roman orations but they won't let me have a peek into what it has. How grotesque! Buy it! You can use it as a cheat-- joke! I'm not really interested in this review thing but I enjoy it! You know comments and everything...
3,Buyers beware!,"This drill does NOT come with a two-port charger as described in the review section, which was a major selling point while searching drills. It says right on the box BDDC180 dual charger included and probably where Amazon got the information for their review. But, you or I would not know this until it arrives at our door. From what I can gather from the pdf manual I found on the BDDC180, only the 14v and 18v models come with the two-port charger, hence the 180 in the model number."
3,GOOD,"My liner lost it's bottom. Didn't know where to find one so looked on amazon. It was just what I wanted, came in just a couple days, was nicely boxed and no effort on my part. Just dropped it in the ground and I was done. (I have inground garbage pick-up.) Nice can & just what I wanted."
4,underground liner,"Liner fits perfectly, arrived quickly, reasonably priced. The only con is the gauge of the material is rather light from the one it replaces and it will be a wait and see if it can stand up to the rough treatment from waste management"
4,The Big Sleazy ain't that easy ...,"Move aside Martin Hegwood, Tony Dunbar, Mike Stewart, Ace Atkins, Julie Smith, and watch out James Lee Burke here comes Richard Helms and his Pat Gallegher mysteries. Set in the French Quarter and starring a down and out horn player, Voodoo That You Do, casts a spell on the reader that's nothing, but white magic.From the sights, the tastes and the smells, Helms builds several thousand words into a picture of New Orleans that's pure pleasure to read and authentic to those who've done more than just the tourist stop. While a gem in the rough at times, Voodoo That You Do, moves through from start to finish at a well clipped pace taking the reader along for fun ride. Pat mixes in the gutter elements along the way walking a delicate tightrope between the various factions of official authority and organized crime.If you missed it there's Joker Poker which introduces Pat Gallegher and about to hit the presses is Juicy Watusi."
4,You can feel the heat,I tried these babies out after the 2nd time I had got back from Iraq and goodness! They work. I used them for the first time New Years bringing in '05. I had been drinking (it was New Year's) and I remember telling her how hot she was(not in looks though she was). It didn't dawn on me til like a week later that it was the Warm Sensations lubrication that I was feeling. Try them!Nick G
1,Junk,"This is a great concept program for creating your own techno style beats, but even with the patch it acts very buggy. It will crash or get stuck in a continuous loop. I don't think I have ever purchased a program with so many flaws. (Well maybe ""Age of Sail 2"" was worse.)Don't waste you money on this! There has to be a better program out there."
1,Would have been ok if it worked.,"A lot of good ideas, but none of them work. Too much graphics, animation and visual effects, which I believe affect how the program performs and creates delays in sound performance. Samples are fine, but if you want to record something new, you will be better off with an 1980 8-track."
4,Solid.,"A great, solid album by Elbow- I wouldn't expect anything less. People should stop comparing them to other bands... they're just Elbow and they just sound good. I guess you could say I'm a sucker for piano-influenced rock, but I love this album. Best tracks: ""Forget Myself,"" ""The Stops,"" ""Great Expectations,"" ""Puncture Repair.""I recommend this band to fans of Doves, Editors, and Turn Breaks."
3,Asleep in the back still my favourite,"This is certainly not a bad record by any stretch of the imagination (and this review is also only a first impression), but I must say that neither this nor their previous album have made the impression on me that Asleep in the Back did (I would give that record 4 or 5 stars). Ok, so this is a bit less eclectic than AITB, but that was what I liked about their first album."
3,What happened?,"This by no means is a bad record. Its just not the Elbow that I was expecting. If you follow from Asleep in the Back to Cast of Thousands, there is a progression of sound. This record just doesnt follow the Elbow sound that I like, I guess. I really like the last track. I know it's only about a minute or so, but it's got alot of feeling. Im really curious as to where they will go from here. Hopefully a little more experimental than this record."
1,signing songs,Video did not contain many signs. My child did not like it. It did not hold his attention. I would not recommend it.
4,Sizing-???,"Buyers really need to know what size wrist these watches will fit - 6,7,8,or9 ???Not interested in buying and then just have to return because the watch is too small!~"
4,Danielson Polar Standard Creel,"This item has many good features and the size is just what I was looking for, as fishing season has ended it will be awhile before we can attest to its durability."
4,"A ""brainstormer"" for age 4-6","This workbook consists of 70 exercises on thinking skills in various aspects, such as visual discrimination, problem solving, understanding relationship,inference, sequencing, storytelling and rhyming words. My 5 years old girl needs me to explain the exercise to her, and it gives her some brain storming. As what the editor written: If a child has grasp of how to think, school success and even success in life will become more assured. However not in ONE workbook, the Gifted and Talented Workbooks have some more titles on maths, reading, science and language arts."
1,I never received the product which I paid for,"I am very upset I ordered this product over a month ago, and I have not yet received it. I am doing horribly in my class because it has yet to come in. I don't think ill ever use amazon again."
3,Good home workout although duration is a little short,"It's a 45 minute exercise video. Pros - good variety of body pump techniques. Really works out the muscles. Short, sharp and intense. Cons - you need a decent sized exercise room to do this workout. You need the workout weights, the bar, a work-out bench and a medicine ball. How many homes can spare this type of space? Also it can get a little monotonous after a few weeks - doing the same workout day in and day out, unlike a live class where the routines vary and there's interaction. Also it is a 45 minute workout video whereas most pump class I've been to go on for an hour. At the end of the day it depends on what your needs are - if you prefer variety and some interaction with the instructor, then it may help to enrol at a gym instead. If you want a pump work-out at home varied with other types of activites that are more interactive then this should work out okay."
3,Was disappointed,"I was disappointed with this video for one reason. I purchased it for the adjustable barbell strength training. Amy is featured on the cover with the barbell and has it in with her training equipment during the video, but never once picked it up and used it. I feel the cover should be a reflection of the contents."
3,"Interesting topics, unashamed book promotion","Alhough the topics were interesting, the format of the show, which was recorded with a studio audience, was quite awkward. The program would have been much better in a documentary format. I came away from the DVD ashamed that a Christian writer did much more to promote his book than do similar secular programs."
2,Not realy sport beans-juice jelly beans,"Ok, these are not really that healthy. They are made with fruit juice which is better than corn syrup BUT they still have canuba wax and the electrolytes are added not natural and no complex carbs( you need brown rice syrup to be a complex carb and has the natural electrolytes- like in Sharkies). These leave a coating in my mouth(from the wax). These are really glorified jelly beans. I feel no energyboost and they mess up my blood sugar. If you want the real deal get sharkies."
5,Amazing,"My son is a runner, and he loves the Jelly Bell Sport Beans (Berry). I bought him a box for his stocking."
3,sports beans,I was expecting a the watermelon flavor to be more like the original jelly belly beans. It had a bit of a acidic taste from the extra stuff they add to make it a sport bean. I shared it with friends who didn't seem to mind the flavor though. I don't think it really gives an extra boost either.
3,Jelly Belly Sport Beans,"I love the Jelly Belly Sport Beans! The only problem I had was that the picture is misleading. I wanted the Blue packaged Jelly Beans and I got the purple Jelly Beans. I like the purple, but my last box was purple so I wanted a new flavor. I'll still use them, but was disappointed that the beans were not the blue ones."
2,Can't Turn Off Sleep Mode; On/Off Switch Misfunctions,"I purchased this HD with the intent of using it as my primary drive for document work. However, the Seagate drive automatically goes into sleep mode after 5 minutes or so, and the sleep mode feature cannot be disabled. It is very annoying to work on a document, hit the save, only to discover that the drive has gone into sleep mode in the meantime. While it probably only takes 10 to 20 seconds for the drive to awake, that 10 to 20 second wait becomes tiresome fast - those 10 to 20 seconds seem like much longer when you want to continue work or open another document.Also, after the warranty expired, the on/off switch began acting up, requiring several tries before it would turn the drive on. A month or so after that problem began, the switch on its own jumped out of the ""on"" position while I was reading my email, and now I cannot get it to stay in the ""on"" position, making the drive unusable until the switch is fixed."
2,bad experience,"Though I've heard good things from this drive and SEAGATE is a prestigous brand which is why I mark it 2 stars eventhough I couldn't never use it.This drive requires a FireWire port. Although it has another USB 2.0 port, it most likely not gonna work or going to die fast. So if your computer doesn't have a FireWire port, there's a high chance you gonna have to return it.Another thing is external drive is extremely vulnerable to bad handling so I don't know if buying it online is a good thing to do."
2,"I am just learning how to use a computor, I hope this book helps me.",Like I said above I am just learning how to use my computor at the age of 61any help I can get is great.
1,ATV Handlebar Mittens,The handle bar mittens have a small opening so they were hard to put your hands in if you are wearing gloves. I returned mine for this reason.
2,Good but overpriced,"This is a good product, but for vegetation I found it to be too expensive. I've learned that the generic powdered products say from Ace Hardware are much less and do the same thing growth wise. If you want your plants to yield better, research for the best products for bloom or flowering and save your money on the vegetative phase."
5,It a true fusion of modern and ancient Jewish music,"I first Heard Oi Va Voi at work about 8 years ago, since then I heard them time and time again.Some of the tunes in this particular album simply make me cry.If it is possible to lose yourself inside the music, this is the right album.Jewish music is a rare commodity these days so OVV is the crown jewel for me."
1,Frat Boy Dub,"I realize now that the word ""Dub"" is now as overused as ""Funky"" or ""Alternative"" and is used as label to describe things about as accurate as ""nice"". I bought this album based on the band's name including Dub in it----mistake. I think these guys would be more at home with surf music---it kinda sounds like surfer frat boys hitting the bong & trying to recreate their vacation in Jamaica. If you're looking for authentic or boundary breaking dub ala Laswell, Wobble or Robbie Shakespeare---look elsewhere."
4,Very funny--Just a few boo-boo's,"A very funny book and I hope there is another in the series. But for the record, it's a ""conga"" line, not a ""rhumba"" line, and there were four versions of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers when this book was published, not just two."
2,Not as advertised...,Be careful which version of this figure is being shipped to you. I received the 'clear' version which omitted all color of these figures which makes it very unappealing.
3,Transparent,"I ordered from this seller, for a regual version and ended up getting the Clear version. Very displeased. Figure is still nice, but not what i asked for. Do not recomend buying from this seller"
5,The best is Beautiful,Beautiful is a song that anyone will love.It is touching and reasonable. It is hip hop and out of control.
3,Not the best deal,"While the cover is cute, all the other ""Beautiful"" import singles have that picture, and the picture is also in the insert of the album STRIPPED.The song itself deserves more than 5 stars, but the accompanying remix to ""Dirrty"" sounds terrible. They've slowed the song down, and taken away its amazing beat only to replace it with a piano. Ew.The main reason I bought this cd was for the music video. I had already downloaded the music video off a fan site and thought it had great quality but could be better. The version on this enhanced cd was even worse.Needless to say, I should've just stuck to downloading the music video."
2,Could Have Been Worse....,"Hellbreeder is yet another killer clown movie. Evil has taken over a small town. A mother becomes consumed with finding the killer of her son.... a killing she witnessed herself. When a stranger arrives in town, horrific murders begin and Alice(the mother) is convinced that this is the same killer and will do whatever it takes to prove it. Some cool gore/bloody scenes and violence. I've seen alot worse. Worth renting for the true horror fans."
1,DEVILISHLY DULL,"HELLBREEDER is so poorly acted, directed, edited and filmed that I couldn't even finish watching it. There are so many padded scenes adding nothing to whatever story there is, and it's about as exciting as paint by numbers. Definitely a loser."
1,GOOD GOD WHAT A PIECE OF ...,"my god this movie is not worth your time. do not watch this! i felt nothing but boredom whatching this piece of crap, in fact i even coulnt whatch it all. GOOD GOD botom line this is crap pure and simple crap put on film. the ones responsible for this movie being realeased should be shot on sight."
2,The pilot episode that turned into the Sonny and Cher Show.,"Interesting only in seeing Sonny and Cher do their Las Vegas lounge act schtick before they got slick. Funny to note that the audience wasn't quite sure what to make of the verbal barbs the two throw back and forth. Great singing numbers though, and very cool clothes."
2,Not worth what I paid,I was not happy with this DVD. I was looking for some of Sonny & Cher's old comedy shows with some of their great songs. Very few songs and mostly just a review of the old show.
2,VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL ON THIS SITE!!!,"The Sonny and Cher Nitty Gritty Hour was edited a lot from the VHS copy I bought here at AMAZON, many yrs. ago.I remember Cher singing to her daughter, and many other stories which would have made it a hit with all the Sonny and Cher fans.This dvd just had the basics and that angered me, why would they cut some sections out as they did?This dvd I did buy, because I thought it would be like the original, but it's not at all.Real fans will still get a story of the duo from it but the real story is missed by me and others, the new company who made the dvd should be ashamed of makinng this incomplete dvd!"
2,Annoying,Maybe my expectations were too high but this collection fell so short that I couldn't wait to get it out of my house.The trivia bits are not only supercilious by cloying and sophomoronic.The selection of songs clips seemed to be the very worst of occassions where they were performed.I'll keep looking for a good selection of this incredible couple's body of work.
5,not one problem,"I had not one problem with this order, unless you can complain that it came so quickly, I had to put it away before Christmas and almost forgot that I had it."
1,Broken leg clamps,At first I loved this tripod and all its features. Worked great for a few months then the lever on the ball head started slipping and couldn't completely clamp down on the ball. The lever is plastic but the ball screw is metal. Overtime the lever gets loose. The most serious problem was that recently 3 leg clamps broke when I tightened them down. Glad I discovered this before it damaged my SLR. Seems that this is a common problem with this Manfrotto re-branded tripod. It makes me cautious about the Manfrotto's as it seems they have a similar type of leg clamps.
3,Bends to easy,"If you have a short chimney this Chimney Brush may do the job. I have a wood burning furnace in my basement and my brush has got to go all the way down to the basement. As you know, times have change and they are making things cheaper. My old brush is made much more heavy duty to with stand the pressure of pushing it down the long chimney. This one tends to bend to much. So I ended up just hooking up a rope onto it and I just pull it down the chimney instead of trying to push it. This brush works but it cannot handle hard use. For a short chimney or gentle cleaning it will work fine."
4,chimney brush,The item arrived in a reasonable amount of time in good shape. I think it will do the job for a year or two before I need to order again.
4,Easy to use,"Very easy to clean your own chimney. I saved a ton by doing it myself, Took about an hour including vacuuming out the bottom."
3,Not bad...,"Not bad to watch, if you are not aware of the signs leading to and during the end times. I've already looked into the end of the age more thoroughly thru Bible prophecy, also while listening to Christian radio and it didn't really present me with anything I didn't already know. I was hoping that this video would use more computer generated animation to act out what might occur during the rapture and tribulation period according to the scriptures. It does present the rule of the anti-Christ well using live action and computer graphics and it has plenty of scenes of wars throughout the world at various time periods in the 20th century. In conclusion, it's good to present this to an unbelieving friend, but if you are a devout Christian, it's a bit slow."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this hoping that it would be an additional source of information about the Battle of Yorktown. However, upon watching it, the producers forgot that this is a time of ""sound"" in pictures and not the ""silent picture"" period of time. After about 5 minutes of watching it I was bored to death! Don't waste your time and money buying this DVD as it doesn't even work as a paperweight!"
2,Kind of Boring,"I had expected this to have some narration, but it's just the marching and battling. That's not terrible, I guess, and as a reenactor myself, it's fun to watch, but two hours of it gets a little stale. I could watch a couple of excerpts on Youtube and get the same thing.Buy it if you'd like to watch combat and don't care that you have no idea what's going on. For me, it's good to watch for the drill (and see if I can spot people I know). But, in the end, I would have liked something a little more educational.Also, from a technical standpoint, the text that precedes each battle is difficult to read. I have an HDTV, maybe it's not meant for HD."
2,Very amateurish,"Was excited to get a video on Yorktown! However, I was very much disappointed when I watched the video and it is poorly done. There was information on the engagement and siege but the video is very disjointed - using reenactors - and not edited to show a very cohesive story. Some of the video shows engagements with units that did not happen. Also - with the use of reenactors - the whole thing is like another reenactor filmed it and did no editing. The footage drags on alot and for no reason. At least 25 minutes of footage could have been cut to make a better video. Maps of the siege would have helped alot as well as more information on the geography and commmanders would have been beneficial. This looks like a video that was done with very little editing. Very amateurish and very disappointing - much like the battle of Cooch's bridge one. Great if you are a reenactor or was one that participated in these reenactments, but otherwise, not worth much at all."
5,Dominick Dunne is fascinating,"It is easy to see why celebrities, criminals and perfect strangers have told Mr. Dunne their secrets. He is so interesting in a gossipy, name-dropping but sweet way. His Hollywood life makes an engrossing tale, much more entertaining than fiction."
2,not vintage dunne,"would have wanted more detail . . . instead, there are far too many names ""dropped"" and not nearly enough told about them . . . just glad that i got this from the library and did not buy it."
3,An outsider's view of Hollywood from the inside....almost.,"Artfully art directed with Dunne's own snapshots of parties given during the end of an elegant era in Hollywood.It seems as though Dunne lived his life ( and documented it ) so he would one day be able to prove he was a part of it.Dunne was obsessive in his attempt to be accepted by the rich and famous in 60's Hollywood,almost to his own detriment.An entertaining read ( tons of great photos ! ) that really gives you a sense of what life among the stars was like,and how truly meaningless it all was."
2,Not very insightful.,"Dominick Dunne's book should be publicized as more of a photo essay rather than a text based insightful memoir of the era it covers in Hollywood. The book was not very insightful and exposes Mr. Dunne to his short comings as a person who circled the wagons of the major stars in Hollywood without actually being invited to the club.The pace of the reading is very monotonous and Mr. Dunne discribes many instances as the best time in his life. He does this so much that it becomes less powerful and surprising.It is clear that Mr. Dunne and his wife used his wife's family money to throw lavish parties as a carrot to gain access to Hollywood stars. However, it becomes apparent early that these stars never actually embraced the Dunne's as members of their circle and once the Dunne's stopped given parties these so called friendships ended.Unfortunately, this is reflected by a book that lacks depth and insight.I would not recommend this book to Amazon's readers."
2,"Ah, the joys of getting your scrapbooks published.","If only *I* could get paid to publish MY photo albums! Admittedly, his are full of famous people while mine are full of people nobody knows, but still--the pictures are only occasionally actually revealing (Liz Montgomery and her former husband playing mind games); the rest are your standard ""Smile at the camera"" variety. The style of the book doesn't really lend itself well to any in-depth self-analysis, but please, you need one or the other (good pictures, good writing). Mr. Dunne, I love you, but you're in need of a good editor and shouldn't be allowed to run loose with every passing whim."
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"What a dissappointment after being a dieahard fan of Mr. Dunne's page turners I fell asleep with this one. Mr. Dunne please go back to fiction which is what you do best, your life is not as glamorous as you remember it to have been."
1,Boring text and quality of photographs embarrasing.,Stories not very interesting and very repetitive. Everyone is glamorous and famous. As an interloper into the Hollywood scene of the 60's Dunne fails to capture the times and is not insightful in the least.
5,who is an ardent Dominick Dunne fan,"To anyone who can remember the Los Angeles of the 50s, 60s and 70s, this book is a treasure and a real piece of social history. It is wonderful to see how beautiful and stylish the women of that era were, and how the behind-the-scenes entertaining of celebrities was accomplished. The photo of Priness Margaret with a cigarette in her mouth is priceless, as is the shot of Natalie Wood fixing her makeup in the reflection of a dinner knife. Dominick's black and white ball, which preceeded the Truman Capote extravaganza held in New York, apparently was the prototype. It's a wonderful read that I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn more about behind-the-scenes Hollywood."
3,"An entertaining, light read","If anyone wants to wallow with a package of bon-bons on a comfortable sofa with a good book, then this is the one. Full of candid photos of celebrities in their heydays, it is also a cautionary tale of what happens when you try to ""keep up with the Joneses""."
4,"Thank you, Mr. Dunne","I just finished reading Dominick Dunne's most recent book, the photo memoir The Way We Lived Then, and felt praise was in order for Mr. Dunne for the superb work he put into this book. At times funny, sad, touching, and very inspiring (especially for those who are aspiring writers, which I consider myself), The Way We Lived Then visually resembles an old family scrapbook (if members of one's family just happened to be famous). The text of the book reads like an unforgivingly honest account of someone who has been ""through the fire,"" and lived to tell about it (unlike many, some of whom Dunne writes of in this book), wiser and stronger as a result. It was very unselfish of Mr. Dunne to share his life so openly with his readers, and to write as candidly, and movingly, of his pain, as well as his subsequent ascent as a writer. Thank you, Mr. Dunne, for an excellent book. I am eager to read more of Dominick Dunne's work, and share more of his experiences."
4,Strong Recommend,"The reader gets caught in a whirlwind of names being dropped on them left and right, but once you climb out from under the pile you get a good autobiography with excellent pictures and a candid story about our hero, Mr. Dunne. Entertaining read, beautifully compiled, and a recommend. Another excellent job by Dominick Dunne."
4,All the facts and more...,"This slim little book taught me more about opals than rummaging around in the opal stores and book stores of Sydney ever did... Fred and Charlotte have managed to add lots of juicy information about opals - how they are made, history, cutting, what makes them special etc and present it in a very easy to read manner. A great book to give anyone an indepth knowledge of opals!"
5,Fantastic Book,"This is the most informative and fun to read book on opals ever published. As a collector and opal dealer, I highly recommend this book to learn about the opal history of Australia with lots of great stories!"
4,Next Best Thing to a Trip to the Mines . .,"I liked the description of the miners and their culture at Lighting Ridge. But if you want information on how to select and price an opal, especially a black opal, you need Paul Downing's Opal Identification & Value."
5,A great beginner book for understanding opal,"An easy read. Finished the book in a couple of hours. Covers all facets of the opal trade. Explains the different methods of manufacture. How to spot lab created specimens, doublets and triplets. This book gave me a true appreciation for opal and the delicacies in working with it. I will purchase further books from Mr Ward. If you want easy, informative reading on gemstones, Fred Ward should be your source."
4,Intro to Opals,"Informative book of the history of Opal mining in Australia. A useful guide for classifications, purchasing and overview for a lay person. Easy reading, but not quite enough depth to satisfy that ""thirst for knowledge""."
3,Confusing but Chilling,"Kenneth Allen McDuff was one of Texas's worst serial killers. Though convicted at one point for ""The Broomstick Murders"" and sentenced to death, this was later overturned in 1972 when the Supreme Court abolished the death penalty for a time.McDuff was eventually let out of prison due to severe overcrowded prison conditions and he committed nine more murders, for which he was eventually executed in 1998.After McDuff's second arrest in 1992, Texas completely overhauled its prison system to prevent violent offenders from winning early parole.Stewart's book, available by paperback, gives so many details as to be confusing. After a few chapters, one doesn't know the good guys from the bad guys. On the plus side, it reads like a crime novel and keeps you on the edge of your seat.Not for the faint-hearted."
4,Fun and silliness for young children,"Mary Middling is just one of the fun, silly nursery rhymes in this children's book. From rhymes about a person who stood on his head all the time, to a tribute to mice, to a man who painted his dog yellow and pink, there is a lot of fun here for any child. With colorful illustrations on each page Mary Middling and Other Silly Folk is a recommended children's nursery rhyme book."
4,EARNS RESPECT DESPITE CERTAIN GOOF-UPS,"The first half of this film has a great intelligent flow in terms of acting, dialogues, screenplay and background music. I loved V's introduction to the film and his dialogue delivery was very intriguing. Natalie Portman does a good job and she's proved her multidimensional side. This film has a few goofs but I'm not discussing them here, towards the second half it gets draggy and one feels the editing could have done more justice to the climax. The best scenes in the film are the ones where Natalie Portman gets a letter which she reads out and the writers' story of life is relived.Definitely worth a watch in the theater.Overall - 8/10ps - I liked this film more than the newspapers said I would and more than most people did."
5,The power of great filmmaking combined with,"uncompromised honesty to the death. That's what this film symbolizes to me, that unbending honesty that comes with a genuine revolution. Sur for some ""V"" would seem to go to extremes, and Evey a little too stark and minimalist with the movie, but I think and know that they genuinely captured the spirit of the ""Vendetta"" comic books from the early 1980s. I have said enough. I won't spoil it for you (the experience of the movie) -- See it.Captain Josh."
4,Good flick,"This was a decent movie. I like the postmodern feel of it and the rather hopeless feeling you are left with after a viewing (but then again, maybe that's just me). This movie got a lot of hype, but it is worth at least one viewing."
1,I HATE IT,I AM SORRY I HATE THIS MOVIE THE MAN WITH THE MASK I FIND THIS TERRIBLY STUPID SORRY BECAUSE EVERYBODY LIKE IT
1,Could have been a worthy Monty Python flick,"When a script needs to resort to solemn quotes to drive home ""the point"" (in a grotesquely phony British accent to boot), you can tell that subtlety is in short supply and the movie will soon fall apart under the weight of its own tripe. And so it proves. My favourite moment of involuntary comicity is the one marked by the memorable 'BEHIND THIS MASK THERE IS AN IDEA AND IDEAS ARE BULLET-PROOF!'. Profound words indeed, except that bullets turn out to be idea-proof instead.Here's a movie that should be watched to see the law of unintended consequences in all its glory."
1,Is this really encouraging free thought?,"In essence this is a film that attempts to decry fascism while simultaneously imposing liberal ideology on its viewers. The end result is both pretentious and maddening. Yes, the writers/directors would like you to believe that conservatives are the root of all evil. Yet, when trying to make this point the movie is so narrow in scope that it fails to tackle the foremost relevant issues. Nor does it handle the select few that it does encounter with sophistication. It's all to the extreme and very stereotypical.The political agenda is too distracting and the film itself overbearing due to the extent of didacticism."
1,"Hey, Dragoness. Chill out!","First of all, don't insult WWII veterans. That's not cool.Second, WWII veterans were fighting AGAINST what Hitler stood for, not for it.Third, very few (if any) WWII veterans saw V for Vendetta. I don't know if you noticed or not, but it's not their cup of tea.And dudes, if you want entertainment see something else. I could barely keep m y eyes open."
1,Are you people insane?,"This movie's horrible! It spends it's two-and-a-half hour running time cramming left-wing political propaganda down your throat and expecting you to like it! An entire hour goes by without ANYTHING HAPPENING!!!!!! The characters are two-dimensional and boring!Ultimately, V For Vendetta supports exactly what it condemns--chiefly, prejudice. Christians and Conservatives are villainous charicatures in this one-sided ""morality play,"" whereas liberals can do no wrong (even if they're murdering people and blowing up buildings). That's interesting, given the film makers focus on social tolerance. I guess if you disagree with their viewpoints, you don't matter.And is blowing up buildings really the best way to make a point? I don't think so. I hope you don't.Man, I want my money back.And my two-and-a-half hours.Don't see this."
2,Silly movie,"Typical leftist fantasy where all conservatives are evil and only the brave homosexuals can save us. Last time I checked, Muslims, not Christians, were blowing up the Tube and guess what? They don't dig homosexuals too much."
2,Its like against the government,"so here's the deal. Its all about this bad guy whos like the leader of England and he's bad. so this dude dressed like one of the three musketeers wants to kill him and save the country from the evil governemnt people who watch everybody all the time and don't allow freedom. i hate faschists. Fascism is bad. its like this customer i had at work the other day bacause you see I'm like a waiter. Well, this guy just ordered his second plate of buffalo wings--no fooling!--and i was like ""ReallY!"" and his friend went ""Dude, your not supose to say that!"" and I said ""sorry"" and the dude was all ""Shut Up Tad!"" man that dude likes buffalo wings. Fashcist. I hate fascists.So anyway about the movie. Its okay, i guess. Pretty exciting. good ideas. I gave it two stars cuz things can always be better you know i don't want to be a brown noser or anything"
1,Enough Already!,"Look, Bush won the election. Period. He got the electoral vote, he got the popular vote. Like it or not, he's president. Accept it.You'll attack President Bush, but not the terrorists who attacked our nation. Why is what they did okay?And why was my friend censored for criticizing the terrorist behind those attacks while others are allowed to openly criticize our commander-in-chief?Don't get me wrong. I'm not an extremist right-winger, but give me a break. This is way out of hand.Politics aside, V for Vendetta is still a terrible movie. It's talky, it's slow-paced, it's too long. The characters are as deep as a pitri dish. The protagonist overcomes his obstacles so easily they might as well not be there, so there's really no conflict.How is that entertaining?(By the way, Turkeyman. Your idea's not original. The right-wingers beat you to it.)"
4,"Totalitarian Dystopia,Huh?","Wow! It's all here...a vigilante(and failed government experiment gone rebel)waging war on a ""totalitarian"" society wreaking of the ""fascism of Christianity"", religious/cultural bias, and outright intolerance in the name of God. V's objective? Freedom by any means necessary...a donning of the mask to unmask the monstrous hypocrisies of a world under the iron curtain of a particular faith. A message shouted a million times before and a keeper for atheists and agnostics...by the way, I'm a born again Christian who's secure enough in his faith not to be offended by the portrayal of faith in this film...so if my applause is rubbing any religious heads the wrong way...grow up."
4,Such a surprise.,"I had diminished expectations about this film. After renting it, I purchased it. The message is timeless and quite appropriate for the current mess that has engulfed the US. Freedom can be supressed for a time but not forever. I so admire the strength of spirit and the fearlessness of the character in this story. Courage seems today to be delegated as 'quaint and obsolete'. We need to have heroes, not of fiction, but as inspiration to those who have more than their own self-interest at heart."
5,What an Explosive Film!,"""V for Vendetta"" is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I strongly feel that everyone should have it in their personal DVD library! This movie exposes the massive deception that is regularly carried out on a daily basis by our mis-Leaders. When a tiny group of elites own the media (like in the US), it's becomes relatively easy to manipulate an entire population. Besides the action and great plot, this is one of the many things that I enjoyed about this movie. Eventhough it's classified as fiction, one can plainly see the parrallel to what has happened to our freedom in the past 5 years. The message is clear, ""People should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people!""Dr. Matthew J. Loop- Author of ""Cracking the Cancer Code"""
4,V is too smart!,"If you like to use your brain when you watch a movie, you will LOVE LOVE LOVE it. If you just want your explosions and then get the hell out, with everything explained and spelled out then this movie is not for you. Stick with Pirates of the Carib, Transformers, and GI Joe, those movies will do the thinking for you. Your brain on ideas vs. your brain on mindless entertainment."
5,Fantastic,"Really enjoyed this. Maybe not the best ""production"" but I am a storyline guy anyways and I always love the classic hero movies."
5,Finally watched V for Vendetta,"Thought it was well done considering it didn't have a huge, huge budget. Any fan of the comic books should love the movie."
5,Great,"I liked the way they sent this product, it was protected very nicely and was at my door few days after ordering. I will be ordering again."
4,"Great movie, decent Blu Ray features","Great Movie, Great 1080p HD quality, great sound quality.not so good blu ray features, its only one blu ray disc, no blu ray live.this is only the blu ray tho, no DVD combo or digital copy"
4,"Would have been 5 stars, but...","Target has an exclusive promo of this DVD that includes the comic and a lenticular cover. Had I known, I'd probably have bought there. Other than that, this is a great movie, a great story, and looks to be a great dvd set."
1,At last a movie for people who mindlessly rebel,"***** Spoiler Alert *****See if you can follow this:1. The hero hates his government because it betrays, kidnaps, and tortures people.2. The hero betrays, kidnaps and tortures the heroine, offering the lame excuse that she asked for it.3. The heroine forgives the hero.4. The movie has a gross revenue of over 132 million according to Box Office Mojo.My major objection to this film is that in my opinion there is never any excuse to torture a woman.Apparently there are many young people around the world for whom torturing women is pleasant culturally accepted diversion.If you are not one of these people, do not support this film."
1,Where is the Anarchy?,"In V for Vendetta, a masked hero attacks the institutions and leaders of state that rules with fear, torture, incarceration, and propaganda and inspires the masses to rise up and overthrow this morally bankrupt government.But--then what?Was V fighting for a better government?Or NO government?While the movie seems to leave V's politics at ""Freedom! Forever!,"" in the graphic novel V passionately tells us that a free society is one where we don't cede our power to government, where we don't let leaders run our lives. The V movie ads say ""People shouldn't be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."" To the V of the graphic novel, government shouldn't just be afraid of the people......it should be ELIMINATED by the people."
5,GREA MOVIE,The price of the movie was cheap but it was sealed and I don't remember when I saw a movie that criticize the government so great
4,VENDETTA,A very apt movie for the current times.An upgrade on 1984 that presents the important message with pieces of warm emotion ie love and music !
5,Absolutely Brilliant !!,"If society wasn't so shallow, they would cast Mel and Tom by the roadside, where poor actors should be left, and seek out brilliant actors such as Hugo Weaving, star of V for Vendetta. If the script had been a bad one, I think Hugo still would have made it brilliant, but we all got lucky here -- they actually found someone left who can write. Script, acting, story, plot, cinematography -- brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!!! Buy this film...memorize it..show it to all of your friends and have the time of your life! The movie also doubles nicely as a stern warning for the future -- watch what your government is doing."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"I left. The main character making V's over and over crushed me. I know this is a weak review; I just had to put in my one star on this one. I only hate one other action movie this much, which was Face Off with Nicholas Cage. He kept saying ""Face Off"" to make sure you got it. V for Vendetta? Are you sure? I was thinking it was an S. V? Really? Can you repeat that again? It was painful."
3,A Christmas Present,"It came before expected, as always with Amazon, the person who received it was very happy with it. I would buy again."
5,One of my favorite movies,"In England, a tyrant rules over the ignorant masses with an iron fist. The people live their lives not knowing that some of the worst tragedies in their history, were perpetrated by the government. 1 man in a mask has arrived to enlighten them, and give them the courage to start a revolution.This movie is excellent. The acting, dialogue, story, and message are all very powerful. This is also a very dramatic and personal film. The characters are backgrounded well and their fates are all intertwined in a tragic way. I love Hugo Weaving, Natalie Portman, and John Hurt. As expected, they make this movie simply fantastic. It has a very comic book vibe to it. There isn't another film out there like this one. Definitely check it out."
5,A Movie You Won't Forget,"If you have not seen this movie, you are in for the best time. The acting is great, story line terriffic.Unlike the Matrix series (which I very much enjoyed), this movie will make you watch it over and over (or pause and rewind to be sure your ears hear correctly). The messages sent out by V are so relevant today. The one spoken by V that I can't forget is this: ""people should not be afraid of their government, the government should be afraid of their people"".Watch it soon, before it's banned."
5,YES YES YES!!!!!,"If you were to see me walk into this movie, you would probably do a double take. I'm only just old enough to go to a PG-13 movie, much less one rated R. I wanted to see it, but I wasn't allowed to until my mom had. I didn't have high expectations for it at all. I thought it would be just another so-so superhero movie. I was so frickin' wrong! I love it, I love it, I love it! It has wonderful theatrical elements; a bit of romance, a dash of mystery, a drop of horrorfying secrets, a gallon of controversy, and three healthy doses of [...]-kicking action! It keeps the veiwer on the edge of their seat, and at one scene in particular makes you just wanna' cry out in victory. See this movie. You won't regrett it. ;P"
5,The product is excellent,V for Vendetta (Two-Disc Special Edition)The product is excellent. The Movie is Super!! EXCELLENT!!
3,Nothing at all like the book,"The movie could not capture the emotion in the comic, and it rewrote many parts of the story...those stupid brothers.However, the film was quite good, if it weren't for the fact it was supposed to be based off of something as good as the book."
2,"Skip the movie, read the graphic novel instead","Fans should not fear the Wachowski brothers. The Wachowski brothers should fear the fans.Considering how well the Brothers W dealt with the interweaving of complex ideas in the first Matrix movie, I was willing to be optimistic about their ability to adapt one of the most brilliant works of fiction I'd ever read. I am however, thoroughly disappointed. They might as well have put Keanu Reeves in the role of V.The graphic novel is a thought-provoking discourse on freedom, anarchy, and the price we pay for security. It is many-layered, complex, and intelligent - little of this translates to the screen. Entire characters and plotlines are rewritten or ignored in the film version, and important themes are lost entirely.As a standalone piece of work, it might suck less. But for a fan of the graphic novel, the film adaptation is a poor reflection of a work of genius. Do yourself and your brain a favor - read the book!!!!"
1,Propoganda hack at its finest!,"Ah yes, the classic story that Hollywood butchered for political gain. Well I was just disappointed with what they did here. Why they had to change so many things from the original story is beyond me. I mean, was it going to hurt that many feelings to show the oppresive left wing government that the original story was about? Of course, so lets make it PC, show anything not far left as fanatical with untrue labels, and make it right wing bad! That way we please all the liberals who are running Hollywood! And then they can have Brokeback Mountain AND V for Vendetta for under 30 dollars! So sad that so many of the sheeple just wander around eating it up hook, line and sinker.Natalie Portman is great but I just felt so sorry for so many of them in this film because the story was bastardized for political purposes."
3,Disappointed but had its Bright moments!!,"First of all, I thought it was kind of cheesy and how it was just not much as what I expected. I will say at the end with all the masks. ""cool part!"" Although, i will buy it in HD DVD format but I think it's a movie that will grow on you if watched more than once. . . or twice. . . for that reason I just think that it felt like Zorro meets Revolutionist meets Batman Gotham City. It had its moment but I thought the Natalie Portman character was kind of stupid, and I like Natalie. . . but oh well...... Should Rent it and atleast give this movie a try. I'm buying it lol with just 3 stars but thats because i'm builting an HD DVD Collections and think this movie would look great!!! But if i hated the movie lol . . . forget HD lol rather buy Muppet Show HD DVD than this, but it wasn't BAD!!!"
3,V for Vendatta,A good movie that sticks it to the government for its behind door ways of secrets against society for it own leaders moral purposes in the name of greater humanity. Secreat human experiments done like in the real life case of black unbeknown being given syphillis and then with experimental cures. Well one guy got mad as hell and wasn't going to take it anymore. Portman and Hugo create good chemistry with a detective having he own second thoughts towards the government leadership.
2,paranoid violent movie,"I was stuck somewhere when this movie came on and ended up watching parts of it. If your idea of a hero is someone filled with hatred, bitterness, fantasies of violence and revenge, plus able to torture a poor innocent girl for her own good; then this movie is for you. The very philosophy behind this movie is sick and twisted. Of course, Hugo Weaving is a great actor even when he is forced to act from behind a Guy Fawkes mask (I think that's what it was), and Natalie Portman is good, but it's not her best role. I don't care for movies with agendas and this one clearly has an axe to grind. I want to be entertained--this was NOT entertaining. It was depressing."
5,A very good movie...,"The most important thing about the movie is that all you need to know is in it. You just have to be able to sort it out to understand it.Do we praise the character 'V' for his actions? Would we cheer for the actions of a real person who takes such measures? And would our answers be different if our government controlled the media and launched terror against our own citizens? Would we be willing to stand against our government if it did? I tend to think these questions are the ones that the movie makers want us to ponder upon. They've succeeded quite well, from my point of view. Mind you, its not a direct adaptation from the graphic novel.The extras are very good on the disks.All-in-all, well worth owning. My highest rating for a movie."
5,Eye-opening and haunting.,"This is the best movie I've ever seen.I think the filmmakers successfully combined difficult theme with entertainment, even if there aren't many action sequences.I liked many memorable quotes and witty conversation throughout the film, especially Valerie's ""an inch....we must never let them take it from us"" and V's ""if you are looking for the guilty, you need only look in the mirror"" etc.Yes, V is right, each one of us is responsible for our society because we are all part of it. I thought this movie suggests we should not blindly believe what we see or hear - we especially tend to do so when we are in fear.Besides the story, Hugo Weaving is a great actor. I got fascinated by his speech, which made V attractive.I would give Vendetta more stars if I could."
1,Not DVD quality,"Clearly, this is not up to DVD quality standards. Movie is 640x480 (not 720x480 widescreen), and only 2 channel, vs 5.1 DD audio. Even more pathetic? The price is identical to the actual DVD. Save the money, and the slow download. Buy the DVD, and archive as needed."
1,P is for pabulum,"Skip the movie, read the comic books.It is no surprise that series creator Alan Moore removed his name from the film. This celluloid rendition is a banal, paint-by-numbers reproduction as dreary and inept as the world it presents. Vanished without a trace are the original's edginess and vision.Welcome to Wachowski brothers' flatland."
5,SPECTACULAR!,"This was a chilling movie about a society that allowed thier government to go too far. The parallels to what is going on in this country right now are eerily foreshadowing. The characters were amazing, the visual effects were stunning. This is a movie I would recommend to ANYONE!"
5,Wow,"When I put this movie into my DVD player, I thought it would be another attempt to adapt graphic novels into screenplays. This one turned out to be a step above the rest. It had all the elements to make a great movie: Violence, Romance, Comedy, Action and Drama. The only thing about this movie that rubbed me the wrong way is how realistic it all seems. If we don't wake up as a world, this could very well be our future. This movie was so great and I can't wait to add it to my collection tomorrow when it's released."
5,Great picture/great sound,"'V' is awesome on Blu-ray, the True-HD audio is great. (I accidentally started watching in normal Dolby Digital 5.1 and sensed something wrong) After switching the audio I was wowed.The image is top rate as well.The story line is enjoyably complex and makes you think hard about political and moral implications of decisions of government and how the general populous might be manipulated. It's a movie I can watch over and over."
4,V for Very Good,"I really wasn't sure what I was expecting, but this was much better than I thought. Very good story and even makes a point. Natalie Pormant is very good in this film unlike other stiff performances."
5,great movie,"This is a movie that has great symbolism. Besides that it is a smart action-packed movie that displays great use of slow motion, and the whole ""matrix"" special effects that everyone that they needed to use after it came out. This movie is one of my favorites and I think everyone should watch it at least two times."
5,V For Vendetta,"The DVD arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition. There were no surprises. There was one scratch on the cover that was described by the seller, so all was completely honest. The seller is stellar!I bought this DVD for my 22 year old son. He says it's Awesome!"
3,Confusing,"What we have here is some sort of fascist England whose main issue seems a dislike of gay people. We also have a freedom fighter who plans to blow up the British parliment building in public view in the name of freedom. To me the story made little sense.The acting was reasonable. Nothing memorable.From the directors of the matrix, I thought the special effects were rather ordinary. I suppose I expected more from them."
4,Not bad,"Despite needing some editing, Alan Moore's vision of a 1984-style England manages to come through as both chilling and timely."
4,Hits the mark,"Beautifully acted, stunning set design, great story. There is nothing better than a movie that makes you think and this dark look into our not-to-distant future rings true to a large degree. This movie goes to show you that great visual effects only work if they support an equally great story/script. Bra-V-o!"
1,Horrible sound,"The movie is fantastic, however the sound quality is really terrible. It would not play in true surround sound. Picture looks great, but I prefer to have sound and picture quality... The old DVD at least plays in surround sound."
5,GREAT MOVIE AND SERVICE,I received my order within the same week and it was exactly what i expected..GREAT MOVIE my favorite
3,Boring!,"After reading some other reviews I thought I must have missed something, maybe I fell asleep!A weird movie, as someone else wrote, "" A blending of Zorro, The Phantom of the Opera and 1984"", a great description, or maybe ""Zorro meets Batman"".I love mystery, intrigue and a complex plot, but this is so over the top it is silly, a bizarre movie that over promises and under delivers.I would like to 're rate' this movie down to 2 stars at best, it really is a waste of 2 hours and the theme that terrorism is OK if it's on your side is sick!"
5,Stunning,"This movie takes you through a time of an oppressive government. Some of the propaganda mentioned sounds like what is going on these days. That is scary, but this movie inspires hope for those who fight for truth and freedom. The Wachowski brothers have put together another great story without disappointment!"
5,Awesome bluray,"Bluray review: awesome video, awesome audio. It's really impressive how orchestral music can invoke so much emotion and bring tears to the eyes.Movie review: It's an awesome movie."
2,"Reality Check, folks!!!!","Whew, where to begin? well after reading most of those prior reviews I guess we'll start with the film itself. I don't know what the people before me watched, but this film is at BEST decent, trust me. The story itself is nothing new, simply a story of pending revolution against a military/fascist state (worked better in the Comics imo) The film drags greatly, it has far too many lulls"
4,V Is For Very Good.,"I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I thought I would have. It Really is worth viewing in my humble opinion and is nowhere near as bad as some professional critics claim it to be. I thought V was a very good character and Hugo Weaving did a great job of portraying him on screen. It's taken me awhile to get around to this movie but now I've watched it it's on my ""to watch again"" list for sure. Great stuff!"
5,Excellent and very relevant right now 2011,"U.S. Government has ruined the economy (incl. bank bailouts), arrested peaceful protesters, extended the Patriot Act, and now with the NDAA, they can detain American citizens without cause and due process."
4,A chick flick for guys too!,"This is just good movie making! It has all the action guys like, the love interest for the ladies, and - what a surprise these days, an actually well written script with good plot and a turn or two. Natalie Portman is as delicious as ever (another plus for the guys) though the direction on the camera work was poor in that, as so many do for some reason, they kept cutting off her feet. And often the top of her head too. She was barefoot in many of the scenes, but that opportunity was missed by the narrow camera angle. But overall a very watchable film, we actually never used the F/F feature to skip any slow parts. Recommended for a movie night."
3,V for Violent,"I saw V for Vendetta and I liked it, but it was really violent. I'm not a fan of violence. The acting was good and the story was good, but the violence made it hard to watch. Especially the throat slashings. That's not pleasant.Otherwise, good movie."
3,If you liked this you'll love Equilibrium,"It's V for Vendetta but with more action, passion and emotion."
3,It's okay,"Some things about this movie are cool--visually, it can be pretty interesting. And Natalie Portman is wonderful to look at, as always. But the movie takes itself way too seriously."
3,Not That Much Better On Bluray,I have been updating our movie collection with blurays of DVDs that we like to watch more often. I was a bit disappointed with this title because it does not come across as that big of an improvement over the regular DVD.
4,"Great movie, decent picture, bad sound.","This is an amazing and weird movie. I would rate it 5/5. The quality is decent, not the best but still good. The audio is horrible. I had my tv all the way up and it still wasn't that loud."
4,Entertaining!,What a movie should do. Entertain; provoke thought; have a interesting plot. V for violent also. Can acheive same end result without all the violence.
5,"Vendetta, Despot, justificatiion, method","Our emotions are more true than our reason. Even a justified wrong has a price. For the despot the price is the end of a wrong. For the victim the price is personal. The books always balance. This is a wonderful story about truth, exploring the justification of means, the nature of good and evil, and even the hope for the future. The story satisfies our need to see fairness in the resolution of conflicts. Though not all of these conflicts can be made my own, and some of the resolutions did not ring true,it is a soul pleaser at its core."
5,The Best Movie On Earth!!!,This is the Best movie I have ever seen and i have seen a lot of movies. It shows you the terrorists point of view insted of the governments. There is only one flaw with the movie is the book is MUCH better. Read the book befor you go see the movie.
2,"Remember, remember, the 5th of November","Every conceivable, ridiculous cliche about conservative politicians is exaggerated to the maximum and crammed into this movie. Imagine Michael Moore writing/directing Batman meets Zorro.V for Vendetta is visually impressive. It has that dark feel of Tim Burton's films. Hugo Weaving conveys more emotion from behind a mask than most actors can manage with faces fully exposed. The fighting scenes -- what few there are -- are enjoyable.At the risk of giving too much away, the hero, V, is a modern-day Guy Fawkes, who is still remembered in England every year on November 5th. Interestingly -- and without knowing beforehand the connection between V and Guy Fawkes -- I rented and watched this movie on November 5th. If anything good came out of viewing V for Vendetta is that it made me want to learn more about Guy Fawkes. The movie was otherwise a disappointment."
5,my favorite movie ever,"this movie is my favorite to say the least,it is loaded with action.from the beginning to end you will see v as a terroristbut for some reason you are on his side.he finally narrows down to the last day,the fifth of november.all of you reading this review,buy the movie now you wont want to miss it."
2,What's this all about?,"I have seen this movie several times, still can not understand the underlying theme. This man dressed up as what? the ""Joker?"" As always, the Brits mouth their words and I find it very difficult to understand what they are saying. Sorry"
5,V for Vendetta (Two-Disc Special Edition),One of the best movies I've ever seen! It has fast become my favorite movie and the special features are aboslutely amazing!
5,An Excellent Evening of action and drama,This is a combination of Orwell's 1984 and Hitler's rise to power with opposition thrown in that should have taken place in the 1930's Germany. I cannot wait until this is released on DVD so that I may add it to my collection of classic movies.
3,V for Vendetta (Full Screen Edition),"The movie was good. But the DVD full screen edition was 4:3 scale. Not the 16:9 scale that I was looking for.It did not described 4:3 scale full screen. Otherwise, I would just get the widescreen edition."
3,Not quite so sophisticated as you might think . . .,This is your typical and fashionable Euro anti-Americanism whereby all the dark forces of European historical absolutism of the left and right is blamed on America and all things American. Anything new here? Hugo Weaving is great with the alliterative lines. Yet the simplistic plot thick with overblown acting-- otherwise known as dramatic posturing or 'chewing the scenery' style associated with British acting schools--overwhelms the 'story' if one may even call it that. Of course we forgive movies with simplistic bombast if they are also entertaining. V the movie is far more interested in its 2-dimensional statement of 'blame the yanks if life is going to hell in a handbasket' than in any semblance of entertaining its audience or provoking new thought. I give it a moderate three stars for a jolly good display of Euro acting 101.
2,"Slow moving, boringly predictable....","This is a very slow moving film with a predictable plot and unending dialogue. I was looking for something that would hold my attention and amuse me, but this was more a chore than recreational. It could have been and hour and a half instead of the two-and-a-quarter hours it was spread into. Some plot twists were interesting but not believable."
1,v for vendetta movie,Vendor-Inflateable Maddness- did not send me this product; and they fail to respond to my emails. If you wish to buy this movie~ I strongly urge you to avoid this particular Amazon VENDOR
1,"Terrible, just terrible...","I didn't expect this comic book-to-movie adaptation to be perfect. They never are. But this is so beyond my worst fears. A great frightening, satirical, political, and also fun and emotional adventure story has been completely ruined. Every single scene that is from the original story has been diluted in some way, not just in the sense of softening the political edge, but just plain making them less emotional, interesting, tense and original. And the new poison storyline makes no sense; it's boring, and poorly executed. And usually good actors like Natalie Portmans (accent is awful), and John Hurt (a clown, instead of the deranged but still dangerous leader of the comic) do worse than ever. This movie might impress someone who never read the original, but only because usually Hollywood action movies are even worse. Let's hope the director never gets another job ever again."
1,Political garbage,This movie tries to hide a political propaganda under the thriller action movie theme. Really left a bad taste in my mind.
4,Great Family Fun,"I love this movie, and so do my kids! I can't tell you how much of an interest in English politics my youngest has taken too since we began watching V, but in a household that watches parliament instead of the house of congress, it's nice to have my kids take an interest."
4,I really liked this movie.,This was a very well made movie and great actors. This is probably the best movie I've seen lately as most really aren't that good. The politics of it is really a dictator violently making people conform to their ideals in society. And some of his ideals are not good of course and just for his own benefit.
3,Great acting but it was predictable,"Natalie always amazing acting.Movie is pretty much predictable, quite dark...I loved ""ideas dont die"", Entertaining, but action could be better"
3,Better than Constantine and Count of Monte Cristo 2001!!!,"I gave it 3 stars because the movie is VERY SLOW and there are very few action scenes (I think that the ending was the only action scene in particular).At least! This movie have BETTER action scenes, special effects, story, concept and characters than Constantine and Count of Monte Cristo 2001. Those movies have a very similar storyline and action to this one, but V for Vendetta is MUCH COOLER and bloodier than those two. Infact, those two movies were kind of boring.I think that this is the best movie of the NWOHAM (New Wave of Hollywood Action Movies),P.S: If you enjoy more the story than the action then this movie was made for you.Adios."
2,Should be P for PU,"Sorry guys - this is a ""B"" movie or less. My spouse said ""what were you thinking!"" Who would have thought that they still make these type of movies."
5,"Close to home, and close to the heart",This is an excellent movie with an excellent message. We can not allow the government to think for us. The Government must not be allowed to treat us like servants when we are the ones that put them in power.
4,"would be a five star, if it had 24-bit audio and a high-def trailer","The review on blu-ray.com pretty much says it all, but to be more concise:1. The lossless audio track is nice, but only 16-bit. Some of the quieter and louder details that were audible in the theater are muddled on the bluray.2. I understand the extras being produced in 480p, but the trailer not being 1080p is just laziness.Even with these nits, it's a great purchase if priced correctly. I picked mine up for $12.99, which is quite reasonably given how good it stacks up on other fronts.Recommended."
5,Very Entertaining,"I just received V as a gift. Reading some of the reviews here - didn't have a chance to read them all - it amazes me how any viewer can take a movie based on a comic book so personally. I just wanted to chime in with a thumbs up based purely on the level of entertainment. It's an interesting and really well done film and Natalie Portman delivers a great performance. If you want to talk conspiracy theories, check out these links and tell me it is just a coincidence. Put this coverThe Mask of Zorrounder this coverIn the Zoneand what do you get? Evey is Britney and V is Z. The filmmakers want us all to shave our heads. That's the conspiracy."
2,"Great movie, poor sound quality",I downloaded this today and the sound quality is terrible. I have my computer hooked up to my tv and I had the sound all the way up and you could barely hear it
5,Inspirational,"I loved this movie. I was so inspired by the character V, that after I had rented the movie and saw it for the first time I bought this DVD."
5,V for Vendetta (Two-Disc Special Edition),"The ""V for Vendetta"" DVD set actually deserves 10 stars. The movie MUST be viewed this way, in the widescreen format(it's truly amazing)and the special features are very entertaining. I loved the hidden bonus track."
5,"Awesome Movie, Great (but scary) Message","I thought this was an incredibly entertaining movie with an extremely relevant message, especially considering the nature of American politics. Highly recommend."
5,Governments should be afraid of their people,"If you feel there are inherent dangers in the governmental process and are worried about where that could lead us all - you absolutely must see this film. It's a thinking man's film - not for the mentally faint of heart. Nor is it for someone seeking a light-hearted romp. What this film IS is a viewing must.If I were a high school or college instructor, I would make viewing this film a required part of any Law, History, or Government course.Perhaps the most important thing to remember when watching it is that no society or government lasts forever - not even your own."
5,Thought Provoking,"This is a terrific adaptation of the Comic series to a movie and a story line. One would think it was developed from a famous novel on the peer level of 1984, Fahrenheit 451, or Lord of the Flies. This movie makes one think past the wonderful story to the mirror being held to the face of the USA today. We are only one election away from creating a government similar to one depicted in this film. Witty lines and a great but horrifying story keeps one entertained from start to finish. It leaves you with hope that humans will make the correct choice in times of need and not be sheep to fear of a make believe superstition and made up holy books. Remember, Remember the 5th of November."
3,Not a bad way to spend an evening,"Overall, a good entertaining movie. I got a bit tired of the recurring larger-than-life bad guy on the big screen however."
4,Very good!,I Just wish the volume was more consistent. Otherwise it was very good and I liked Natalie Portman's character and the direction of the story.
3,Good but a little over the top,"Decent movie, but the plot and story line a little weak. Portman did a great job but overall its one of those movies that wont be so memorable you will be talking about it the next day."
3,Very Venageanful Vigilantee!!! Good Movie of Futuristic Politics & Revolution,"From the pages of the triumphfant DC Comics Vertigo graphic novel is a vision of the future starring Hugo Weaving as a swift masked freedom fighter known only as ""V"" who uses terrorist tactics against his toltaltarian government in a futuristic London, during his vendetta he meets a young woman who becomes his ally & love of his life. an extrodonary action packed thrill ride, a triumph, powerful & spectacular. ""Remember, remember the 5th of November"" ""People shoundn't be afraid of their government, governments should be afraid of their people"""
5,This and 1984,"It was interesting to see that they went back to the original 1984 movie and found the guy who played Winston Smith. They used the same guy who railed against 'Big Brother' in the original 1984. It's good to see that he's still able to bring power, fire, vigor and passion to this part as he did in 1984. Everyone should watch this movie and realized that this is exactly what is happening today. The media is controlled, stories are staged (the occupy Wall Street movement) and the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. Everyone needs to take a hard look at this movie as a modern version of 1984 and then watch/read 1984 with Animal farm."
1,Horribly disappointing,"All the right elements here - Matrix filmmaker involvement, Stephen Fry, Natalie Portman, DC comic - this should have been an excellent film.Instead we get one of the lamest screenwriting jobs I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. I kept watching telling myself, ""The dialogue will get better, the plot will become less predictable, it will get better, just give it another 20 minutes..... ok, another 20 minutes...... ok, just 10 more minutes....""Sadly, I didn't listen to myself and instead continued watching - hoping and praying the movie would get better. The acting was fine - they just didn't have anything to work with. The story is the biggest ripoff ever of the much, much better Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.As far as style, I can't dog this movie at all - it's very stylish and clearly a lot of money was spent. Just a shame they failed to include even a half-decent screenwriter in that budget!"
1,No wonder Alan Moore has withdrawn his name...,"Pitiful. Moore's comments on the film are justified. His story of facism, Orwell-ion society and supression of the masses has been turned into a liberal social agenda designed to try and attack the world today when in reality the material has nothing to do with our current society. And thats where it failed. I wanted to see an adaptation of one of Moore's master-works, not someone elses take on the subject and characters, twisting a classic of the genre into thier own creation. Don't waste your time. Read the book. You'll be smarter for it."
2,Odd mish-mash!,"A bizarre blending of Zorro, The Phantom of the Opera and 1984 - only this time John Hurt is playing Big Brother - all in the style of the TV cult series of the sixties, The Avengers. Sadly, Natalie Portman is no Mrs Peel! It's mildly diverting but anyone looking for something really deep and meaningful will be wasting his or her time. Not an original idea on show."
3,"GREAT MOVIE, AVERAGE DVD!","This movie is good, great infact! This is by far one of my fav movies from the year, and so, needless to say I was waiting for the DVD for a long time! SO, come Tuesday I buy it. Well, I'm not happy. This is just an average dvd with hardly any special features! No deleted scenes, no special effects featurettes, nothing! NOT EVEN A COMMENTARY!!!!! The double disk is so bare that is couldve been compiled onto one DVD for sure! What a rip off! Don't even bother with the SPECIAL EDITION, the regular DVD has a better cover anyways!!!!"
3,a little assassination never hurt anybody,"it is as well that I am not familiar with the book this was adapted from as there is no danger of comparing the movie to it (be grateful). see it for the sake of Weaving. purchase it, gaps, blunders and all (remember all those thought provoking questions raised in the Matrix trilogy that were never answered?; well, brace yourself), because you're never going to read Jefferson anyway."
5,Most Recommended!,"Some time ago, I watched ""V for Vendetta"" soon after it came out on DVD. At first viewing, I felt that this film is quite remarkable. This remarkable film was created by Wachowski brothers, whom also created the ""Matrix"" trilogy, which is one of my treasures. These films are gifts to humanity for they provided wonderful yet strong analogy of our reality. If you look closely to these films, you will see the underlying messages as relating to our current situations. While both ""Matrix"" and ""V for Vendetta"" presented the theme of control, ""V for Vendetta"" is the best presented as a government's control of the people. This film brought about the idea of how media is being controlled to keep the people 'asleep' or unaware of government or of dictator's doings. The common people portrayed in this film did not see how controlled they are until the up-lifting appearance of a character named ""V.""In my humble opinion, I highly recommended this movie."
5,Not as Left-Wing as They'd Like You to Believe,"V for Vendetta was an amazing movie; I would consider it my favorite movie of all-time, really. I saw it around seven times in the theater and bought it the day it came out.Although I'd consider myself a left-wing liberal, I don't see how V for Vendetta is instilling anybody with left-wing propaganda. It is an action movie at its core and the action and drama are amazing. There is a moral and there is a story, but it is more anti-establishment and pro-anarchy than anything that has to do with American politics. I should note that the entire movie was made in Germany, set in England, and mentions America's existence only twice.Don't listen to anybody who tells you that it is bashing Republicans in America; those people just missed the entire point of this amazing movie."
4,Very good movie,"I equate this movie to a modern-day fable. It tries to teach lesssons using contemporary situations. It's not anti-Western civilization...it emphasizes freedom of thought.It's worth watching. Check out how the Wachowski brothers outdo the ""bullet ripple"" effect that was in the Matrix."
1,Left-Wing trash,"Well I didn't go watch this movie on the big screen since I had heard the rumors on how big of a POS it was...and for once the rumors were 100% right. This movies is nothing but an anti-U.S., pro-terrorist, pro-anarchy, pro-gay mound of junk. I wouldn't have been surprised in the slightest if Bill Clinton was credited as an executive producer and Michael Moore as director at the end. Kudos to the aurthor of the graphic novel for dismissing this movie and publicly saying it in no way repersented his book. If you hate the U.S., love terrorism, see a consipiracy around every corner, and are a general left-wing nut...then this is your movie hands down. However if you're even 1/100th of a decent human being, save your money and buy a movie that is worth watching. If you're looking for a good movie based on a graphic novel without all the preachy politcal propaganda check out Sin City."
4,Great,I really liked this movie and it's an enjoyable watch. Makes you think about the ending without even realizing it.
3,A lot of it has to do with personal tastes,"A good collection of 1980s trivia, looking at a few of the fads, TV, music and videos. There were some things I thought might have belonged in this book but wasn't, while other things I never heard of were. Some of the comments seemed a bit out of bounds as well (the language is strictly PG-13). Oh well. If you're interested in 1980s pop culture this is certainly a good reference."
4,Good Book,"A book that takes a fun view about everything of the 80s music,live aid,mtv,even catalog ads! If you like the 80s you should read this book!"
3,"It wasn't exactly what I expected, but not bad","It was funny enough, and decently representative of the pop-culture scene that I recall living through.However there were numerous mentions of homosexual issues and quite a few political comments that I could have done without. I find it tiring when an author grinds his axe about personal issues as much as this one has done. A chapter would have been fine and totally understandale, but the consistent focus on the emerging gay culture wasn't what I was looking for."
5,Wonderful music,I cannot understand how Will Downing isn't a mainstream artist. I put him up with the greats such as Luthur Vandross and Peabo Bryson. He's one of the best.
5,Perfect For Romance.,"Mood music doesn't get much better than this. ""Moods"" is arguably Will Downing's finest LP. Featuring lush, gorgeous musical backdrops and some of his finest vocals, this is truly ""grown folks music"", refreshingly devoid of raps, heavy beats, profanity and sexually explicit language. Of special note is a great guest appearance by the legendary Jonathan Butler (whom I had the pleasure of meeting backstage on his last tour)who contributes guitar and flawless scat vocals to the Latin-tinged ""Don't Wait For Love"". There is not a single wasted note here and fans of 'smooth jazz' will be in absolute heaven. ""Moods"" is a fine collection of songs that's highlighted by his mellow remake of Bonnie Raitt's ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" and a perfect balance of love, devotion and understated sensuality. A Classic."
5,Awesome Album,I just became a Will Downing fan recently and I think he is a wonderful and talented singer. I am in the process of buying all of his CDs. His music will definitely put you in a mellow mood!!
1,"Advertised as New, but had been opened","The seller advertised the CD as new in package. CD was unsealed, and appeared to be a copy of the original. The artwork on the cover was also a different color from original. Seller responded and said that Amazon allows them to sell product as new, even if it has been opened."
2,What a disappointment,"This is not a very good novel at all.The story is not credible and unrealistic.The prose is dull and predictable.Most of thecharacters are either bland general types or stereotypes.The only ones you'll even remotely care about are Bobby,Oscar,andMargaret,because they're the only ones who seem to have any life to them.Forget it.There are other,better novels out now."
1,An Infomercial,Boring and a clearly overt Christian perspective. This topic is far more interesting when it is approached from an objective presentation. It is also dated material. BnB Beatles Depot
1,Nothing short of an infomercial,"What this whole DVD amounted to was Grant R. Jeffrey pushing his two books. Much of what he said alluded to, 'read the book for more info.' It was interesting to see the actual codes come alive-- but there was too much 'In my new book...'Also, interesting to note, he left out some of the codes that alluded to who actually wrote the bible.For those looking for an analytical and unbiased look at the codes--- look elsewhere- try finding the Discover Channel's documentary. Otherwise, this your perfect infomercial."
1,ASTOUNDINGLY BAD,I have seen better home made bootlegs than this.It seems at points the picture was filmed a mile away from the stage and the sound is to say the least grim.the best way to summarize this is to say amateurish.If you want a really good spanish DVD get Lius Miguel Vivo it is outstanding.Skip this one
1,This game isn't what you think,"This game is not what you think it is. I thought this game would be like Socom but sadly...its not. Its more of a strategy click and drag, you sit back and watch all the action type of game. So many control issues and it has a slight learning curve you need to adapt to but by then your dead. Graphics are ok."
2,Far too short and redundant,"Initially the game is impressive, but I found myself waiting for things to get hectic and they never did. This is the kind of game that needs 30 levels of increasingly complex tactical puzzles. Instead we get 11 missions that remain very similar intersected by cut-scenes whenever things get too interesting."
1,Game SUCKS,"DO NOT waste your money on this horrible game. I didn't even finish the training because it was just annoying. This is meant to be a war game but to me it seems more like psychological warfare, the people a THQ want to see how long will you last trying to play this stupid game. This is more like chess, pick and pint where you want your pawns to move. The targetting is a joke, you have to select an area where you want the troops to fire but the person you want to kill is like 15-20 feet away the targetting area is 75feet squared (like shooting darts with your eyes closed.) Is this how ""AWSOME"" the american army is?? This game is all pro-american, they make it seem like the US army is the best. If this is how they are trained to shoot then I'm not gonna pay my taxes because like this game its a waste of good money."
5,Judge for yourself,"I don't agree with these other critics. I'm a vietnam vet, and it's realistic enough for me. Who cares if you can't enter buildings, sewers, etc. - that's not the focus. Teamwork and solid tactics: moving from cover to cover, flanking, covering fire and timely use of smoke and grenades is what this game is all about. Don't look for a training sim for the army, it's a GAME. And don't look for another 1st person shooter, this is (finally!) something quite different. I've played all the best new generation war games: MOHAA, Vietcong, COD, Men of Valor, Pacific Assault. I think this definitely ranks with them, dismissed!"
4,Great protective case!,"The Rhinoskin case may not be as slim and trim as other SLVR cases, but its perfect for those who need to protect their phone from hard knocks and drops.My only complaint is that the case muffles the ringer volume significantly and makes it hard to hear in louder environments. Still an excellent product at a great price."
5,Get Your Body Moving,"a delightfully insurgent work that reminds those of us who live in basic freedom what is so good about it.Taboo really dabbles in the realm of exploring your inherent right to use your body as you see fit (in gentle consensuality with chosen others). This is not for the NFL/Lonestar beer set that just wants to get their groove on. This work is for those who consider sex to be a highly sacred, enlightening experience worthy of the most assiduous effort and unbridled, maximum joy.Intelligence and ritual do play an intrinsic role in fits of ecstasy. This book deftly bridges the gap between ""Masters and Johnson clinical"" and ""in your face indulgence"" rendering a delightful and accessible (not to mention highly mystical) middle ground available to those with the proper focus and stamina.If anything, the book provides keys to becoming more sensitive to the finer nuances of human beings' favorite pastime.Enjoy!"
3,"good, but...","This book would be really good for someone who has never been exposed to the writings of Hyatt and DuQuette before. It has a lot of good info on sex magick and the psychology of sexuality. The problem I had with it is that it really doesn't contain much information that isn't available in their other books. If you're a big fan of the two authors, look it over, but it's basically a rehash of older material."
3,mildly taboo - definitely not horrid nor shocking,"I was quite disappointed after reading it, as it was more of a collection of other works that I already own. With that said, however, if someone is just commencing their journey into the wondrous world of sex magick it does provide a good background and overview."
1,Ripped off!!,I couldn't believe that I bought this crap. I didn't learn anything from this book. It has so little content. Most of the book is an appendix listing the stocks on the Nasdaq. This is most likely an attempt to make money from the day trading craze. I bought this because of the last few glowing recommendations but they must have been paid to write it. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. There are better ones out there that provides better details on day trading.
2,"Not much substance, lots of filler !","This book is 350 pages but all of the relevant information could be squeezed into 1/3 that amount. I got 1/3 of the way into reading the book when I realized that the rest of the book is all appendices. Approximately 127 pages of the book are names and the corresponding symbols of Nasdaq listed companies. This might have been helpful before the Internet, but now it is a waste of space. It does give some basic information for the begginer who has no idea about day trading, however if you base the price on relevant information, in my opinion, the price should be under 10 dollars. If you have a little knowledge about day trading, you will not get much more info from reading this book. If you have no knowledge about daytrading, you might want to look around first, in my opinion,you can do allot better."
4,"A Bit Antique, But An Excellent Orientation","This book is very inexpensive (thanks again, Dover), and talks about all sorts of matrix methods in optics: ABCD matrices for paraxial ray tracing, Jones matrices, coherency matrices, and Stokes parameters for polarization, among other things.It's not a terribly deep book, but it is readable, lucid, and complete. It got me up to speed rapidly on an area I was fuzzy in, so for well under twenty simoleons, it's a great bargain."
5,"Excellent, was exactly what i needed.",Was recommended the book by a coworker and is exactly what I needed. The seller was great in communicating the details about delivery and with any questions I had.
2,Pretty boring and disorganized,"If you are already involved in optical computations, but have forgotten some fundamental tricks, this book is for you. As a trainer or reference it is difficult and obtuse. It is a string of mathematical methods linked together by math relationships rather than application to optic relationships. It was not of much help.However, it is very inexpensive in the paperback form. You get what you pay for I guess."
5,"Mac Studio Fix-Love the product, love the price on Amazon!","This is the only product my daughter can use on her sensitive skin. When I found it on Amazon at a great price, I did not hesitate to order it. Even with shipping charges, she saved nearly $10."
3,Above average night light.,I ordered a number of these nightlights. They are attractive but rather dim in light intensity. The product is resin and is fairly opaque. The more brilliant the night light in color in the image the brighter the light will be when in use (the lemon is bright but the iris is dim). Not as special as I expected. Very slow delivery.
1,Uh? what happened?,"This is the worst gaming strategy guide I have ever read! It has nothing to do with this game! Buy the game, but DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!"
1,Completely worthless,"I dusted off this book now that there is an XBLA version of the game for the XBox 360 and I was reminded that this book is nearly worthless. For the record, my book has the correct story. It's still awful, though.- No maps. Zero. None.- Descriptions (locations, what to do) are vague.- A lot of secret things (Bottles' puzzles, etc.) are missing.- Brentilda's tips vary in each game so the list in the book is useless. They could have at least included a checklist or something.If you need help with this game, check out GameFAQs or one of the other online resources. Purchasing this book is a complete waste of money."
1,What are you talking about!!!!!!,"Your totaly wroung, the person who said that this game was horrible 0n 7-14-98 is my friend (no realy) and he is absolutly right. Banjo is not trying to rescue his girlfriend from the giant,he is trying to rescue his sister tootie from the witch,gruntilda. I havnt read this guide yet but i have the offficial one from nintendo. there is only 9 worlds in the game so i dont know where these other 7 worlds are coming from. This is the worst thing i have evr herd of.DO NOT ORDER THIS I HAVE THE GAME AND I KNOW!!!!!!!"
1,This strategy guide is horrible!,"Although I haven't read it I can tell that this guide is totally wrong!First of all, the story in the publisher's note is the first story which Rareware decided NOT to use.2,there are 9 worlds(plus Gruntilda's lair).And if you think I'm guessing because I don't have the book, well I have the official players' guide and the game. I would have given this 0 stars if I could."
1,This is Mumbo-Jumbo again...,"And if you want to know... the main thing you need to get in the next game Banjo-Tooie, (supposedly to be released in Feb. from many web pages I've heard) will involve some very weird big eggs (about the size of Bango!!!!) with Question marks on it."
2,"I recommend you to see, ""Mary, The Mother Of Jesus"" instead","...These actors who played the roles of Jesus & Mary were both serious most of the time and they did not show enough love to another. I think the actors were just cold in their characters. I don't think the real Jesus and Mary would have been like that in real life. So the movie of, "" Mary, The Mother of Jesus"" & the movie of ""Jesus ""from 2000, showed a lot of what their loving characters might have been like. If you want to watch a movie about Mary or Jesus, then I HIGHLY recommend you to watch these two other movies I recommended you - I'd give them both 5 stars. This movie here, I'm not giving it a good score except 2 stars. The two stars is based on the actors performance, other than that; the movie would have been good. So, if you rather see them serious, then this movie is for you. :)"
3,Somewhat disappointing,"I received this movie as a birthday gift, and couldn't wait to watch it. However, it wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be.My biggest complaint was Mary herself. In the beginning, she is chatty and gossipy with her friends and flirty with Joseph. Later on, she follows her son Jesus through his ministry but spends most of her time just looking at Him. They barely have any conversations at all!I'd still recommend seeing it, though, as there WERE a few scenes that were very well done. The visitation was beautiful, and the agony in the garden was perfect. And when Jesus is carrying His Cross and Mary is following--well, it makes you want to cry.This is an okay movie overall, but Jesus of Nazareth is much better!"
4,Highly recommended,"This is one of the best Gospel films I have ever seen. Especially good for Catholics, since it portrays the Gospel accounts of her life properly (for instance, the angel Gabriel calls her ""full of grace"").Two minor quibbles: Mary seems to have labor pains (though it's somewhat understated) and the movie rushes through Jesus' ministry a bit quicker than I would have liked (though this is more a movie about Mary than Jesus, so that's understandable).I watched this movie along with the 1979 Jesus film by the Genesis project; they complement each other very well, each making up for the other's weaknesses. Amazon.com doesn't seem to carry that film, however :-(. But this one is great!"
2,disappointing remake,"What a disappointing new release by this author. The book seems to be a random assortment of ideas and past-published material that fails to hold together with a cohesive focus. As a fellow spiritual director, I had expected a presentation of contemplative spiritual direction that would plumb the depths of our ministry. The book fails to communicate the depth and grace found in 'soul work' and would inspire few who would depend on this work as a solid presentation of the topic. Lots of breadth with little of the expected depth from a man who has made this work his life."
3,"Good stuff, but watchout after the wash.",We used the bedspread for few weeks and it was in good condition.Just after a wash (in cold water)it had lots of wrinkles and have to iron it out! Over the product is good.
1,very bad,"Hi every one,these pike sheet sets are not at all Good, it seems to be good in picture but when i see those it is very bad quality and those not even work more.Iam from india i felt it wont work for indians at all.I lost my money."
5,Great New artist discovery,"Its not often that I come across someone who's music grabs me instantly but Emily has done it. I heard a sample of her music from a free cd that I received from MAc Addict magazine. I was sold instantly and went to Amazon and did the one click dance to get her latest album. Nice voice and tunes, an original.Great StuffClaude DiamondWWW.ClaudeDiamond.com"
3,Just OK,"Feels flimsy and kind of is, takes some getting used to since you need to squeeze two or three times for some larger stems. Maybe I am still getting used to it. Sometimes it is surprisingly effective. Time will tell."
2,Pinch Point Trap,"I have used this hand pruner for the past several months and the design certainly has not taken safety into consideration. I have found that without contant attention to position my hand carefully when cutting branches, etc. the palm of my hand will be pinched when depressing the handles. If you buy this wear thick gloves."
5,just great,"These pruners are the best I have ever owned. They make your pruning a snap. We also own the longer pruners, used for tree trimming and any other pruning job you might have."
3,"Like It, Mostly","This is my first ratcheting pruner and I like it alot. A minor flaw concerns the handle locking mechanism which tends to ""lock"" unexpectedly. This mechanism is riveted, so I cannot tighten it easily. I haven't tried ""peening"" the rivet to tighten yet. Also the blade is a little more flexible than other pruners (too thin?). I really like the ratcheting feature, which takes less effort to cut thicker branches than a non-ratcheting pruner."
5,More than societal sexism,"Mark E. Kann's work is important and fascinating. He goes beyond the idea that American politics (especially the presidaency) is the result of general male domination in Western society to argue thath it was specifcally built into the political stuctures of our nascient nationhood. As such, he not only contributes to the discussion around a potential woman president, but he adds nuance to issues of masculinity and presidential politics."
2,You have to know Latin grammar to use this dictionary,"You have to know Latin grammar to use this dictionary. Perfectly simple words like 'dans' and 'ejus' are not included -- you have to know what the roots are to look them up. A good introduction to grammar is included, but for those that do not want to take the time to brush up it would be MUCH more useful if all word forms were included with cross-reference to the roots."
1,Useless for Latin phrases,"I purchased this dictionary for Latin phrases, because it says ""Over 100,000 words, phrases, and translations."" I soon recognized that this dictionary is simply for ""words."" For instance, if you would like to know the meaning of ""ipso facto,"" you cannot find the phrase in this dictionary, First, you need to know that ""ipso"" comes from ""ipse"" which is the word you can find in this dictionary. There is no ""ipso"" in this dictionary. No ""facto,"" either. This dictionary is useless for Latin phrases, unless you already have basic knowledge of Latin. Then, why would you need this kind of compact dictionary? I rate this dictionary with 1 star, because ""Over 100,000 words, phrases, and translations"" is misleading."
5,"Quick, easy to use reference","Wheelock's Latin (Wheelock's Latin)This handy desktop reference is full of surprises. It is well arranged, as expected. Also expected was the Summary of Grammar since this is standard operating procedure for this type of reference. Unexpected was the quick reference section to historical, mythological, and geographical names, Latin Writers, key dates, later Latin (language) developments, and a few good maps. This is a must for the average Latin student and beyond for a quick, easy reference. Don't expect it to be a full lexicon. Remember, it's only a desk reference and fulfills that function with style and ease."
4,Reference work with this item,"For what I need, this product has a perfectly adequate vocabulary coverage and is very good in supplying meanings in both directions.It would not be suitable for a user needing advanced vocabulary or for a serious student of latin. My needs are looking up latin phrases and titles of documents for use in a different field altogether. I very rarely need anything more than this provides."
4,"Two disk tribute to the greatest Pro Hockey player of alltime, but I still like the CBC Special w/ P.Gzosky better!","A very fine career retrospective for ALMOSTeverybody's favorite Sportsman, let aloneHockey Player. Long live the 'Floater'sLeague', the WHA!"
4,"Why a ""Special Edition?""","It is annoying that they come out with ""Special Editions"" after releasing the original version. Basically, it like saying ""We know you already spent $40 on this, but now we want another $40."" Three of those greatest games are valid (81, 84 and 93) but the 83 All Star Game and 94 Goal #802 game have no business being on there. They should have game 7 from the 87 finals and game 2 of the 87 Canada Cup on there. Game 2 of the 87 Canada Cup was his best game ever. Watch it. He is all over the ice, he plays a ton of minutes and he plays at the absolute top of his game the entire way."
4,Very Cool set...,"This is a great set. It is a shame for those customers who had already purchased the 2-disc version... All-in-all there's a lot of great hockey on here. The editing could have been smoother - as soon as there's a whistle you jump to the face-off; it may take a minute to figure out what the result of the whistles was - sometimes the edits rush you along so quickly you wonder if a penalty was actually called. I guess you can get used to it. Also, the set focuses almost entirely on Wayne's carrer as a goal scorer, obviously that's probably the most exciting aspect, but in a 4-disc ""Ultimate Gretzky"" set I would have liked to see more about the well-rounded player he was. It would have been nice to have some highlights for all of his assists - Wayne the incomparable set-up man. Otherwise, thoroughly enjoyable."
4,The Great One,"I'm a huge Gretzky fan. When I happened on this item one day, I bought it in a flash.The quality is a little lacking in some of the game clips, but I suppose that is to be expected since it is a bit dated. Content overall is pretty good. There could never be anything bad to say about getting to see the Great One in action over and over again. This set is definitely a keeper."
3,It was just ok,Well I bought this DVD after I saw some clips of Wayne Gretzky on ESPN classic. Its Ok but seeing that they're going to release the one with 5 full games really made me sick since I already bought this one. Seeing that theres going to be 5 full games on the new one really puts this one to shame.
3,alright songs,"there's no denial they had catchy songs and hooks.and to be honest this set best captures them in all there glory.if you must own one D.L. disc then this is the one.and compared to korn,limp bizket and all the other overrated groups out today this group looks almost brillant."
2,where is the old Leppard,"one song from the the first two albums , thats it really? what about Rock Brigade , Let It Go , Saturday Night ? this stinks . the early stuff is the best . remember that next time you release a greatest hits."
3,Def Leppard's Greatest Hits?,"This is the cd that first got me into Def Leppard. It wasn't until I got all their other cds that I realized there were some great tracks missing. I decided to make my own greatest hits cd. I put them in order by how good one song flows into another. Heres my list1) Rock of Ages2) Photograph3) Love Bites4) Foolin5) Pour Some Sugar on Me6) Animal7) Bringin on the Heartbreak8) Too Late for Love9) Die Hard the Hunter10)Hysteria11)Rocket12)When Love and Hate Collide13)Mirror Mirror14)Armageddon It15)Paper Sun16)Rock Rock (Til you drop)This my list, of cource I would of put more if there was more room on my 80 minute cd. Tracks I wished I could of included were: Two Steps Behind, Woman, Let's Get Rocked, Stage Fright, and switch 625. Im sure theres more I just don't feel like listing every song that I like by this band."
4,What has 9 arms and 10 legs?,"Being in high school in the late 80's, I thought Def Leppard was matched only by Motley Crue and Van Hagar. Truly great pop-metal. Overall a good collection. I realize that Def Lep wanted to present the ""hits"" only, but I think it's too bad they didn't show the whole picture. Though I like them all, SIX tracks from Hysteria? That's half that album. And nothing from the first record? I would haved loved to seen ""Hello America"" or something from that. You'd think it's inclusion would benefit everybody. Just 1 from High n'Dry too. At least Pyromania is represented by 3 songs. Plenty of ballads, though I'm sure somebody wishes there were more. But on the positive side, what IS here is mostly classic Leppard that will make you def. Now where did I put my British flag muscle shirt?"
5,"Indeed, some of their greatest songs on here","It's not a surprise that they would call this cd the Def Leppard Vault. They put most of their greatest songs in there. I know all the songs and it's hilarious, because I stick it in my cd player in my SUV and sing right along everywhere I go...(when I'm not busy jamming out to Rob Zombie or Nine Inch Nails) Quite a difference from what I usually listen to, but I grew up with this music. The leaf doesn't fall far from the tree."
3,When Britain Rocks Hard,"When you talk about Def Leppard you can't think but associate the guys with legendary producer Mutt Lange.It is no surprise that most of the material included here (and the best, i'd dare say) it's his.The collection relies heavily on the singles off their 2 most successful albums: ANIMAL is the one track that got me into Def Leppard's music.Still has a great part in my Summer 1987 memoriesHYSTERIA and LOVE BITES are the power-ballads that bring emotions to this disc, along with HAVE YOU EVER NEEDED SOMEONE SO BAD?.POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME is the most explicit song..honey and skin and all that's in bwetween...And then WHEN LOVE AND HATE COLLIDES marks the new DL direction.Some tune are embarassing..ROCKET and MAKE LOVE LIKE A MAN just plain ..., but most of the rest is good.The band shows that there is more than the Queen coming from England for all the world to see..LOL"
5,Truly the greatest,"This really is a collection of Def Leppard's greatest hits, the most memorable and most popular. ""When Love and Hate Collide"" fits perfectly in the middle of the classics as a beacon of sorts of how the new stuff fits the classic mold and where the rest of their new music is going. Nice additions of Pour Some Sugar On Me and Rocket's video versions, the more popular versions of the two. Excellently compiled and produced."
5,A must have!!,Best of the best here! Get this while you can for your collection as it won't be produced since the new Best of was released in 2005!
5,Commuting Music,"Def Leppard has never made any excuses about who they are and what they play. I certainly am not going to make any excuses for them either. But their sound has matured, since their simplistic beginnings, and endures. They are like the Energizer Bunny - going, and going, and... You've got to have this CD in your repertoire if you are like me and you need the relief and escape that simple melodies, catchy lyrics and phrasing, and hard hitting, in your face guitar riffs can bring you, to take away the stresses of the day, or prepare you for those boring meetings. This is the classic D.L collection. You will find yourself wondering aloud, if ""you ever needed someone so bad"". You betcha!"
5,For any Fan of Def Leppard,"This is a must have CD for any fans of the group Def Leppard. The music is amazing, with old favorites that just make you want to sing along when ever you hear them. The new song ""When Love and hate Collide"" is absolutely amazing, and that song alone is reason enough to get this CD. If you loved this band at any point in your life, this is a must have CD for your collection."
3,Mixed bag,"Def Lep rocks, but, I must say, I really wish this had a better representation from High and Dry. That is, by far, one of the most kicking albums ever. And to not include ""High and Dry"", ""Let it Go"" and ""Lady Strange""...that hurts."
4,Good Collection,"This Def Leppard collection brings back a lot of memories of the 80's and contains some really great songs. In my opinion, the songs that really rocked out were their best, as opposed to the softer, slower songs. I don't think Def Leppard was suited to those slower songs, but really rocked hard on songs like ""Rock Of Ages"", ""Photograph"", and so on. I just really enjoy their songs where they let themselves go totally, THAT is real rock! Overall, this is a good collection, but could have been better if only the hard-rocking songs were more concentrated on."
5,def leppard vault 1980 1995,"def leppard greatest hits cd is good an bad. the cd has almost all their hits. the cd is misses some songs like too late for love , ring of fire action rock rock till you drop. they should have put 18 or 19 songs on the cd. over all the cd is good."
3,Too Self Indulgent,"Do these guys know what the word ""hit"" means? There's two songs on here from their later days that never were hits and one song that's entirely new. 'Scuse me? New music doesn't belong on a ""greatest hits"" CD. Conspicuous by their absence are such classics as ""Too Late for Love"" and ""Gods of War."" Another reviewer was correct when (s)he said to just buy ""High n Dry"" ....""Pyromania"" and ""Hysteria."" Then again, maybe that's what they want you to do."
3,what the HECK!!!!,"this can't be a def leppard greatest hits!! where's ""rock brigade""? where's ""high and dry""? where's the stuff off of ""on through the night?"" i like def leppard and all, but this is not greatest hits."
1,DEF LEPPARD VAULT REVIEW,"ITS OK, BUT ITS MISSING A TON OF GOOD SONGS. YOUR BETTER OFF BUYING EACH CD, YOU GET MORE OF THE GOOD TUNES THAT WAY."
2,"Get the albums High N' Dry, Pyromania, and Hysteria instead","The idea of a Def Leppard Greatest Hits package sounds like an easy Field Goal, but their attempt sails wide. No Good!It's not in Chronological order, the sequence of going from Pyromania's ""Photograph"" to Hysteria's ""Love Bites"" is downright illogical. Whose idea was the song order? It fails to show the Leps change in musical style. Worst of all, it fails to properly represent their first 2 albums. Where, oh where is ""Let it go""?A good song included from High N' Dry ""Bringin on the heartbreak"" was severely butchered.Def Leppard made three classic albums in a row, High n' Dry, Pyromania, and Hysteria that are essential and well worth the investment. Pick those up instead, I'd avoid this compilation, it's not a thorough overview."
5,Wore the last copy of this CD out!,This is one of the best greatest hits albums ever... in my opinion. Want some music to take you back a few years? Just listen to this one over and over.
5,DEF LEPPARD ROCKS!,"Can I give this 6 stars? This is a ""must have"" for any rock fan. Music for most of the 90s has been bland and imageless...not to mention downright depressing. The Leps are a breath of fresh air to the mumblings of Kurt Cobain and the noise of Rage Against the Machine and others. This is what rock should be- FUN, catchy, and full of attitude. ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" defines rock music...and EVERY song on here is great. My favs are Sugar, Hysteria, Armageddon It, and Miss You in a Heartbeat. By the way, the Leps have a NEW album due out soon and a SUMMER TOUR to follow! Check it out and bring some fun into your music for a change."
4,"Great introduction to D-Lep, But...","This is an awesome album to introduce you to one of the greatest bands of all time. This is the album that introduced me to them, but if you want the full experience go and buy some of the individual albums. They are all great. This album contains many of their best songs. Too many off of Hysteria. Although it would be another hysteria song it needs Women"
4,Very Best,"Def Leppard's Greatest Hits is a good CD. They did not miss one of my favorite Def Leppard songs. It is the same music from the eighties but the CD sound quality is excellent. If you like Def Leppard, this CD is for you. If you have never listened to Def Leppard, this CD is the best place to start."
5,Don't call these guys *ROCKERS*!,Joe Elliot's voice still sends chills up my spine! And God Bless Phil Collen!
2,Not enough of the old,"To me, Def Leppard lost something when the drummer lost his arm in the early 80's. I'm disappointed that this album contains very few songs from High and Dry and earlier, in fact only one. Their best song, in my opinion, Let it Go from High and Dry, is not here in favor of the pop crap that ruined my favorite high school band back in the early 80's. In my opinion, after Pyromania they lost all of their creativity and over-produced a bunch of garbage."
1,yo dog!!!,Boooooooo! Def leppard suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuckz. BOOOOOOO! HISSS! this album is a testimony to there horriblenesss! LAlALA! If you hate this you might like P. diityo!
4,"Good, but not as heavy as I wanted it.","This was the first Def Leppard Album I ever bought, and I had heard this was the ultimate hair metal record. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a pretty boy pop metal cd.Although i immensely enjoyed 'Photograph', Bringin' on the heartbreak, and Rock Of Ages, I was hoping it would have those heavily distorted guitars and lots of backing vocals like Motley Crue or Poison. Although most of the tunes me and my family enjoyed, if you are looking for a great hair metal album buy Motley Crue's Greatest Hits."
5,What a great suprise!,"To be honest, before buying this cd the only Def Leppard song i had ever heard was ""Poor Some Sugar on Me."" But after listening through the whole album I've realized what a great band and great cd this is! I highly recommend this cd to anyone who's just lookin for some good rock and roll music!"
5,More great music,On this disk there are songs that are not on the American Release disk. A definate must have for all Def Leppard Fans. Either for yourself of the Def Leppard fan in your life.
5,The Lep's Greatest Hits - That about sums it up...,"Fifteen years of pure rock - this is the best of the first 7 Def Leppard albums rolled up into one, with a new hit - When Love & Hate Collide. Some of these songs define Rock 'n Roll itself - they are truly musical masterpieces.A must have for all rock fans..."
5,"Blows Away ""Today's"" Music!","Def Leppard just flat out rocks...catchy lyrics and hooks...it's all here. Kinda makes you wonder why the good times had to end and kids starting listening to boring, depressing grunge and alternative babble. Lighten up, kick back, and have a good time. I'm eagerly awaiting the Leps NEW ALBUM due June 8th titled ""Euphoria."" It's supposed to be more along their traditional rock sound than their last album, ""Slang."" Also looking forward to their late summer tour in the U.S. NO MORE RAP, NO MORE FUNK, NO MORE WUSS ROCK JUNK!!!! ""Euphoria"" June 8th."
4,"Good, but incomplete","Although this is a very good starter CD for one of the bands that put metal in the mainstream in the 1980's, it's missing a little bit. It could have included at least one song from their debut, and at least two more from High n Dry. But the songs they did put on here are really good, and are their best. Let's Get Rocked is sort of reminiscent of an account I had involving a friend who listened to classical music. In short, this is a good collection for a great band, but it could have been better."
5,A sensitive and very memorable book,"I find it so sad that most of James Kirkwood's books are now out of print. I still have my copy of P.S. Your Cat is Dead. I lent out all of my others over the years and never got them back...now, I'm searching for copies. It makes me crazy to think that an entire generation and generations to come will miss out on this wonderful author. I first read him in my sophmore year of college and was immediately hooked and grabbed every book of his I could find. My college roomate and I fell in love with his writing; much the same way that we did with John Irving. I still feel the connection 25 years later. Each and every one of his books is worth a read. James Kirkwood's life was too short and his work should not be forgotten! HIT ME WITH A RAINBOW is another one not to be missed. Happy reading and good luck to all trying to locate his wonderful work..."
1,Awful product,"I've got pretty much the same review as other displeased customers.The description says ""Clamps inside of 4-inch diameter hose and slides on 5-inch outlet,"" but both ends are mis-sized by 1/4"" or more.You would think this would be the perfect adapter to connect your Delta dust collector with 5"" output to the standard 4"" hose of your dust collection system, but it's not that easy. The 5"" side inside diameter is a little over 5 1/4"", making it too loose to use. I wrapped the output of my DC with a thick layer of rubber weatherstripping to seal the gap. The 4"" side is closer to 3 3/4"", too small to attach a 4"" hose without crimps and leaks. Again, a couple wraps of weatherstrip around the outside of the adapter seemed to do the trick, bringing it closer to the proper 4"".While you're out buying weatherstripping, be sure to pick up a 5"" hose clamp, because the product does not include one, as shown in the product picture.Made in Taiwan."
1,Garbage,"agree 100% with the other 1 star review. it doesn't fit well at all; it might if you wrap your DC's 5"" intake with a ton of tape, etc. to make the ports external diameter larger. it is not supplied with a clamp as shown in the photo either. I will likely return it if I can't figure out a way to make it work."
4,One of the most fun games I've played in a while!,"Yeah, this game is a guilty pleasure. Tons of action, sex appeal, lots of gore. So whats wrong with that? Nothing, if you're in the mood for it, and this game delivers. Look, this game rocks like no other for the Gamecube and the only reason I can see not checking it out is if you can't handle the blood and language. Otherwise, get ready for a non stop slaughter fest using tons of weapons, tight controls set in a B-horror movie type setting. So the story is kind of weak, trust me, you won't care, you'll be to busy chopping up mutated creatures and Nazi's. Anyway, check it out and have some fun! Thats what these games are for!"
3,Get Metroid instead...,"After playing this game it would be hard to argue that Nintendo isn't sensitive to the needs of its mature gaming audience. BloodRayne has it all: scantily clad vampire-mutants, a plethora of four letter words, blood & dismemberment, and endless Nazis to mutilate in any way you please.Overall the game wasn't that challenging. I completed the entire game on a long Sunday afternoon. Anyone looking for a game to test thier mental capacity will be strongly dissapointed. However, if you're looking for a simple hack'em slash'em you'll definitely be pleased.For the reasons mentioned above I definitely wouldn't recommend this game for small children (hence the M rating).If you can find this game used for cheap I would grab a copy, otherwise don't blow your hard earned pay on this title."
3,"Nazis, Blood, and Cleavage","Hard to see what the excitement is about. The graphics are nothing special. The game is rather shallow -- kill people and suck the blood from their jugular vein. Killing Nazis is always a plus, though.The controls are rather easy to pick up. You can use a variety of different views, such as aura view (looks similar to infrared), dilated perception (slow motion), and extended vision (zoom). Not much skill involved with the combat; it is more or less hack and slash.The theme of the game is raw violence combined with sensuality. I'm sure this alone is what is drawing most of the positive remarks."
2,Sigh...,"Well lets see, only a total of three missions, an extremely short game, dismemberment is extreme but cool, graphics are ok, seen better however, controls are a bit annoying till you adjust them and customize,all in all this game is basically just a hack n slash game with relatively no plot."
2,Very Poooor Game,"This game is very poor! Sloppy controls and gameplay, even the graphics are kinda ""jaggy"" no real good story and no thought put in to it!"
2,Another One,"This game is just a quick way of making cash. It's a bad game and the developer is hoping it will sell because of its sex appeal and intense amounts of gore. Don't be fooled, this game is going to be a mediocre (at best) action game. The game is basically a rip off Max Payne, Devil May Cry 2, and Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain with a lot more gore, sex appeal, and the gameplay doesn't nearly match up to the games it is ""ripping off"" from. The gameplay is supposivly very similar to Resident Evil. Although I love Resident Evil, this game is a fast paced action game and RE's controls are better suited for survival-horror..not action.Remember..there are lots of games out there with a lot of sex/gore appeal but that doesn't make them all good. Some such as Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, BMX XXX, Resident Evil, or Mortal Kombat:Deadly Alliance (trust me, it will sincerely be a good game) will be good but others such as BloodRayne are just trash."
1,Average but not my style,"If you want to see blood, blood, and blood, this game is for you, but if you are searching a nice plot and a complete game in all aspects..."
2,A bit too glib and pat,"There may be a bit of the 70's still within me, when I longed to be a stewardess....when Braniff ruled the skies with wildly painted planes and the prettiest stewardesses. As I read Rene Foss's brief recounting about her roots in air travel, her mom had also been a flight attendent...I was hopeful to not only have the witty insight of what Rene faced, but even a little bit of reminiscing from her mother. This was not to be. This book details the trouble and turmoil that a flight attendent todat faces, but there seems to be little enjoyment for the job. Even worse, she does not seem to care for the job or any of the people she comes into contact with, other employees or the flying public. After awhile, it becomes as grating as a teething baby on a nonstop cross country flight."
1,STOP WHINING ALREADY!,"If you are thinking of buying this book -- DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! After about the third chapter I found myself thinking ""So quit already if your job is so terrible!"" There is really nothing in this book that is very interesting or revealing -- just a lot of whining and complaining about all the little parts of her job that aren't all glamour. Give me a break!"
3,Chuckles,"The first two or three chapters are as dreary as a two hour weather delay in Philly but if you can get past that there is enough sophmoric humor to keep you chuckling all the way to europe. Check out her definition of ""Crop Dusting."" When you are done reading it you might consider giving it to the flight attendant you're hitting on."
2,Don't Bother,"Unless you enjoy hearing the whining and complaining of someone burnt out on her job. Many would kill to have her job and she claims to have done something wrong to have wound up where she is. The only thing she did wrong was write this book. Sorry but this book did one thing, put me in a Bad Mood!"
1,very sarcastic,I didn't enjoy this book at all. I found it very sarcastic and not a bit funny. Maybe you have to be in the business...
4,Fear of Flying? Read this Book!,"you can't help but laugh. she is so funny and witty, sarcasm runs through her veins. And everything is true!The chapters are short, wich is good. You may learn things you didn't know. Flight Attendants lingo and daily issues.If you have fear of flying, read this book. It humanize the ""glamorous"" job of a flight attendant. And you'll laugh for hours!"
5,inspiring and so true,"We (there are four of us) are flight attendants and just finished reading this book. It is a hilarious story that, on every page, tells ""our"" story. We just loved it!!!"
3,Hectic Life of a Flight Attendant,"A flight attendant for 16 years, Rene Foss developed a musical revue based on her experience, ""Around the World in a Bad Mood,"" which has been performed in various cities since February 2000. She candidly describes the inconvenience of flying from the perspective of a flight attendant, who constantly must handle complaints, delays, food service, air rage, customer misbehavior, and confessions from other flight attendants. Chapters stand alone, describing different aspects of the culture of airline travel; one includes the lyrics to the ""Safety Demo Shuffle."" There are also insightful details about living in Manhattan in a small studio with a large number of roommates, about the flight attendant's complicated schedule, and about the profession's inevitable frustrations and exciting benefits. I've always wondered how flight attendants manage to stay sane with all the neurotic passengers. Now I know that they're really not and just fake it well."
1,Don't waste your money,This is one of the most boring books i've ever read. It wasn't even worth my time to keep reading. There were no funny stories. It was mostly stories I have already read. This book was terribly unoriginal and a real snoozer.
3,A bit long winded,Not as funny as other similar books - not many laugh out loud moments. A bit of a chore to read.
2,"Could have been good, but...","Parts of this could have been good, if it had been told in a form that actually made sense. The use of poetry, Shakespearean verse, and excessive alliteration made it just annoying. Plus there was a lot of ""poor me"" whining. Even at $3.03, (kindle edition) it was overpriced. I feel sorry for those who paid the paperback price."
1,What a bore is this book and its author,"200 pages of whining and clichés. And through it all she&#65533;s hated the job and practically everyone and everything that goes with it. And it&#65533;s obvious Ms. Foss was her own editor for this project. What a total bore. Becoming a flight attendant wasn&#65533;t her first choice life &#65533; acting was. Rene, honey, let&#65533;s be frank, you can&#65533;t write any better than you thought you could act, and as for flying the friendly skies - - well, maybe a broom would suit you better."
4,Loved it,On my way to flight attendant training I bought this book and realized why I wanted to be a flight attendnat after all. The stories are real and funny. True and ridiculous. Loved it.Now I'm a flight attendant and I still reread this book - she reminds me that all of us have gone through the things she describes.
2,Ho-hum.,"This book is little more than a long article and is, I'm afraid, nothing special. Ms. Foss became a flight attendant after that show biz career failed to work out, then wrote this book and some kind of musical based on same. The book is a long series of gripes about the job/passengers/travel. That's about it.""Plane Insanity"" is a similar book but much more entertaining, I would recommend you read that if you want to read about flight atendants."
3,Has it's moments,"This is a funny book. However, if you are thinking of becoming a Flight Attendant, I wouldn't read this book. Ms. Ross put together a funny book of her observations. Although, she seems to talk about all of the negative aspects of her job. In fact, there is only one chapter where she talks about what she likes about her job. She never admits to loving her job, yet she has ben doing it for 16 years. It did make me laugh......if you have a long layover you might want to check it out and give it a read. It does make you appreciate Flight Attendants. All in all, an average book."
5,Very light and enjoyable reading,"If your searching for inside tips on travel, inside dirt on specific airlines, your in the wrong book. However if you want to read of a typical flight attendants life, this is the book. While some of you wrote negatively about this book I personally think it was funny and enjoyable. I'm a flight attendant and absolutely love my job, but some of the tales she tells are replays of real incidences I've experienced myself. For those who feel Rene ""doesnt"" like her job, you obviously didnt read the book to the end. Rene loves her work and like most flight attendants, its a career that gets in your blood (if it wasnt there from the start) and you never want to do anything else. Being a flight attendant is no different from any other career in that it does have its days that offer some very large challenges, but to add humour to these challenges is what Rene did."
2,Standard Gothic Romance,"This story is a very standard, practically by-the-numbers, gothic romance. It is rather ironic, because the author keeps calling attention to the fact that the heroine is a fan of gothic romance novels, invoking parodies like Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey, yet she never once turns convention on its ear. Elements of Rebecca and Jane Eyre are also present, but unlike those novels there isn't much of an emotional payoff here.I found the book to be poorly paced and many themes, especially potentially engaging subplots and seemingly supernatural themes, are introduced but never developed or explored, while many rather tiresome ones (and supporting characters) are focused on fully.(Lastly, I bought this book because I was looking mermaid stories. This book had very little to do with mermaids.)"
4,Man on the Train - beautiful cinematography,"This film was beautifully shot and skillfully written. The miserable dampness of the stranger (getting locked out of a hotel and sitting in the cold) juxtaposed with the warmth and charm of the elegantly appointed french chateau and the chattiness of the elderly french gentleman set up a wonderful theme - home and meaning and relationships vs. traveller (up to no good) who rarely spoke. The fact that each yearned for a piece of each other's lives was done deftly. The ending, however, was a bit bogged down in over-the-top death images. Overall, though, a lovely movie."
4,Worth the price,"Bought this for our 2.5 year old son, it's a bit big for him now, but we figure by age 3 (summer time), it will be just fine. lots of power, and nice features just right for a little guy. Our son likes the removable engine panel in the front and has found it a perfect place to hide toys and the like. Have not had it in the grass or any other areas where the ""ultimate traction"" claim could be tested, but from what we have seen indoors one could easily believe that this will make a difference.One final note, make sure you check the dimensions on this before ordering. it's very large but we recommend it!"
5,"Awesome ""Little Jeep""","Great fun, easy for the kids to learn to operate. For maximum enjoyment you will want to purchase an extra battery due to recharge time of 14-18 hours. For those of you with independent minded kiddos beware, my little guy (3.5) talks frequently about leaving me at home and taking his ""Little Jeep"" wherever he wants to go."
2,Amazon - A new perspective,"Amazon has changed my mind - they don't always have the best pricing. This is hundreds cheaper elsewhere. I changed my shopping habits and no longer trust in Amazon to offer the best pricing. The Hurricane is a great toy - expensive regardless of the source. Grand Kids love it. Repairs are the issue and you will need them. I have two other Power Wheels products and true to form, this one broke after two months; right on schedule, and much sooner than the high price should allow. Fun fun but inevitable repairs are a HUGE hassle. Our Gnome and the Jeep move at the same pace now. The tires and torque are a plus for yard travel. Battery charge time is is a BIG negative. The extra battery is a good idea but also expensive. I'm done with Power Wheels toys, at the end of the day more trouble than fun.Fisher-Price Power Wheels Ultimate Terrain Traction Jeep Hurricane"
4,Too High Priced!!!,I believe this toy is a little toy much high priced on amazon. You can go look at toy r us and spend half the price. Make sure you research before you buy.
5,Great Jeep - Good Customer Service,"My son uses this Jeep and it holds up very well under punishment. The charger stop working and the company was eager to please and sent me a new charger, no fee. This is a toy that kids will enjoy all year round and I have not seen anything that would lead me to believe it is not safe."
1,DENTAL BILLS,"This jeep has made every kid on the block bleed. 1st - the windshield stops directly in front of a the child's teeth. Any time they run into anything, their faces fly into said windshield. We finally had to cut a noodle and slice it to pad the top of the windshield. Also, because the driver doesn't always make sure everyone is seating down before going, there's been a lot of blood. Not a safe toy, but the kids still love it."
2,Poor quality transfer hurts o/w excellent serial,"The Alpha video release of this serial, Tarzan the Tiger, is a bad transfer from VHS. You can see the flutters, especially if the camera moves. In addition, Alph has put their logo up in the corners of the title cards which is distracting and annoying, especially since anyone wanting to dupe this film has multiple better choices for source material. They ripped it off from someone else, but don't want anyone ripping it off from them, I guess."
