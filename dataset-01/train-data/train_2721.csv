1,OKIEDOKIES ...MY PRIDE AND JOY FUNGUS MUNGUS,The book I read was STONE FOX by John Reynolds Gardiner. I didn't really like this book because it did not have a lot of action. A boy named Willy entered a race to win money so his grandpa could live. His grandfather was ill because he couldn't pay his taxes.... I wouldn't recommend this book...
2,An Adventure,"The book Stone Fox was pretty good,I gave it 2 stars. I would recomend Stone Fox to ten-fourteen year-old kids. If you like exciting,competitive,but sad books,you would love this story. A boy named Willie has to race the the undefeated sled racer Stone Fox. His Grandfather's sick and if he wins he can save him."
2,Stone Fox,"The story I read was Stone Fox and the author was John Reynolds Gardener. My favorite character was Little Willie because he was the main character. The story took place in and Indian town. There was a big race. I didn't learn anything from this book and that's why I put one and a half stars on the sheet of paper. However, I would recommend to a friend or family member."
1,Stone Fox,"January 26,2003 LibraryI did not enjoy this book because it is not interesting to me. The name of the book is Stone Fox. It was written by John Reyndds Gardner. My favorite character is Search Lite because he is a bravedog to go in the race. Part the story takes place at the contest. I wouldn`t recommend this story because it has a sad ending."
1,Horrible book for a young child to read.,"This book is probably one of the most depressing children's books out there. A boy lives on a farm with his grandfather The child's grandfather in the story sinks into such a low mental state of depression that he just doesn't want to interact with the world anymore. There is an evil tax collector. The title character ""Stone Fox"" is only in two short chapters. In the first one he smashes the boy in the face and closes one of his eyes for taking a peek at the Indian's samoyeds. I guess no one cares about child abuse in Jackson Wyoming or are we suppose to ""understand"" the incident for some strange reason. In addition to his incoherent grandfather, a bullying adult taxman and getting smashed in the face, in the final page of the book the boy's only friend, his dog,dies of a burst heart in his arms. What a depressing story for young minds. Get your children Baum's Oz books and let them enjoy their childhood."
5,Special Education Students,"My 5th grade learning support class just finished reading Stone Fox. From start to finish, they were involved in this story. What was interesting to me was the reaction of my ""tough guy"" to Chapter 10. My students were able to understand the problem, empathize with little Willy, and discuss the actions of Stone Fox. My hesitant readers looked forward to class, and many took the book home to read ahead!"
5,A Beautiful story,"This book may be short, but it ends on such a great note (sad, but great!) The main character is developed beautiful and as a reader we can understand him completely and we can feel his pain, worry, and frustration. The grandfather is shown with two side, one side not being that pretty. However much the story is about Willy and his grandfather, it is more just about Willy and his dog, and it is this relationship that makes the book what it is, beautiful.I would recommend this to anyone, adult and child alike."
5,Stone Fox is a great book by John Reynolds,"Stone Fox is about a boy named Willy;he and his family lived in a small town. When winter setteled in,the grandfather got sick. Can Willy take care of the farm and make money? To find out you must read this book. It is the best book. A child 14 years-old could still relate to Willy's issues. I recommend you read this book because you will enjoy it.There are many good charactres in this story,but the main characters are Willy,and his dog Search light. Willy is a good boy who only wants to keep his remaining family alive. Shearch light, is Willy's loyal dog who is at Willy's side all the time. I like this book because of the type of person Willy is. He was small yet determined. He was a good sport,and he played fair. He was young in the story about 10.,I like these types of stories beacause thay have good endings. This book is a must read."
5,"Great story, but prepare for tears","This is a simple chapter book that you'll read with your children in fewer than a dozen night. Just prepare yourself for the very sudden ending at the end of the race. I was happy to see my 5 year old daughter moved to tears, but bed time wasn't the best time. We needed lots of cuddles abs conversations about what happened, and life and death, before she could settle.Bravo to Gardiner for such a simpe but moving book, understandable by the young."
5,Very Happy!!!,"This was my first time purchasing an item from Amazon. I was very happy with my purchase. The book arrived quickly and it was in great condition. No lines, No gas, No hassle. The perfect way to shop!!!"
5,Excellent,I received my book within 24 hours of ordering and it was in excellent condition. I would definately purchase again from Amazon.com.
5,Stone Fox Summary,"Stone Fox was a really sublime book. It didn't have the best ending though it just said. Stone Fox nodded to the boy. The town looked on in silence as little Willy, carrying Searchlight walked the last ten feet and crossed the finish line. I won't say it stunk because it was a good ending but I wish it had told you more about what happened to his grandfather and stuff. I really liked the part where Searchlight and little Willy plowed the field to get the potatoes ( I really like potatoes )I thought in the end the book it was really sad but I won't tell you the endingBecause that would spoil the story."
3,Brian's Review,"The book that I am reading is Stone fox by John Reynolds Gardner. I think it deserves three stars because it is a good book. This book is about a boy and his dog and Grandpa and the grandpa is sick. The boy needs to win the race. The problem is that he needs to win to help his grandpa. I would recommend this book to a friend because it is exciting.Emerson, NJ;(...)"
4,STONE FOX,"The book I am reviewing is Stone Fox written by John Reynolds Gardiner. I think this book deserves only four stars because some parts didn't interest me. This book is about a boy's grandfather who is sick and the boy, Little Willy, who tries to help him. A problem that occurs in this story is the boy needs $50 to enter in a race and the Banker won't let him take money out of the bank. Then the mayor will not let him enter in the big race. Little Willy's grandfather is sick, and Little Willy needs the prize money from the race. I would recommend this book to my friends and teacher.Emerson NJ; 5th grade student"
2,Searchlight Dead,This story meant to show the courage and persistence of a young boy trying to save the family farm and his Grandfather. It was extremely exciting until chapter 10. I completely lost interest in the story when Searchlight died. There was no reason to kill the dog. I would have rather seen little Willy hug Searchlight after winning the race so together they both would have felt proud. The author ended the story in despair!
1,"good racing book, bad action book",The name of this story is Stone Fox John Reynalds Gardiner. I did not like this story because I'm not into dog sled racing books. If you are into dog sled racing then this is the book for you. I'm more into action but stone fox is most racing I would recommend this book for you.
3,Reveiwed by a Bunny,"The name of this book is Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner. This is a good book. The main characters are Little Willie, Stone Fox, Searchlight, and Grandfather. Little Willie enters a race to win [$$] to save the farm. If you want to know who wins the race, you should read Stone Fox. This is a very good book."
3,3 Stars for an okay book. (Stone Fox),"Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner was okay. This book had many opinions. I say that it was sad, but still had some suspense. Willy, the main character, had a dog, and a grandfather. All three of them lived together on a farm. Every morning grandfather would wake up early and made them all breakfast, then woke Willy up, and then they would begin their work. One morning, Will woke up late. &#65533;Something is wrong. Very wrong.&#65533; Willy went to the kitchen to look for grandfather. Grandfather had become ill. It was the kind of illness that a person gets when there are money problems. Willy has to get some money, so grandfather will be well again. Willy entered a town-wide race against the undefeated winner, Stone Fox. With only Willy and his one dog, Search Light, they together try to triumph the race. Will they win OR, will grandfather die?"
2,stone fox,"I kind of liked the book, Stone Fox by John Reynolds, because I liked that little Willy wanted to save his grandpa. My favorite character was little Willy because hewas the main character. He was a caring character in the book. I think the story is good because the end was really sad. I would recommend this to anyone who likes sadstories and a little action."
2,If you do like action dont read this book,Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner was not a very good. It&#65533;s about this kid named Willy whose grandpa gets sick. His grandpa is going to lose his farm because of back taxes. Willy goes into to a race to save the farm and his grandfather. This book is o.k. It has a surprise ending.
3,review stone fox,I gave it that rating because it a good book.I like the part when the race is going on.I didn't when the dog dies.I like when stone fox stop and lets willy win.
2,Review Of Stone Fox,I rated this story a two because it is good but not that good. I would have read a differnt book before I read this one. This would be a good book for begining readers. I have read better books than this one. This is a good book for people who like dogs and sad stories.
2,Stone Fox,The book I am reviewing is called Stone Fox written by John Reynold Gardiner. I recommend this story because it's great. The story is about a little boy named Willy who is determined to keep his and his grandfather's farm and to give his sick grandfather a reason to live. Willy then enters a race so he can raise money to keep his farm. I think this book is a great book.
3,"A Must Read, ""Stone Fox.""","I gave this book Stone Fox 3 stars. There 3 reasons why. First, it was easy. It was easy.Because the size of the words. The second reason is that it was short. I mean it only had 81 pages in it. Finally, the last reason is about the grandfather. He gets sick. And he's old too. I'm sentimental about that stuff. I would recommend this for 5th and 6th graders. Also,for people who like farming and that western kind of stuff. It's easy, short, and interesting."
4,You Must Read Stone Fox,This book was called Stone Fox and it was by John Reynolds Gardiner. My favorite character was the dog named Searchlight. She was an old dog from Indiana. I also liked the character named Willy. Willy was a boy who was ten years old. He wanted to try to help his grandpa because he was sick. Willy's grandpa also had to pay lots of taxes. So Willy and his dog Searchlight were going to try to go in a dog sledding contest and win $500 dollars. Willy entered by using all his college money. Will Willy and Searchlight win? Will they get $500 dollars to pay off the taxes and not lose there home? I recommend this book to everyone. It is a great book and is a nice thing to read. So go to your local library and check it out!!

3,Stone Fox Review,"Willy, Grandpa, and a dog Searchlight live together on a potato farm. One day, Grandpa is sick. They do not have money to pay for the farm taxes. Therefore, Willy decides to join the dogsled race. The strong Indian, Stone Fox, competes against Willy. Finally they both win the race."
2,"A Favorite as a Child, Revisited as an Adult","I first read this book in grade school with the help of my mom. I remember it fondly as a heroic tale with a sad ending. I remember the illustrations vividly.I walked past this book at the book store recently and was thrilled to see it and remember how much I had enjoyed it. I read it that night.In all honestly, I was greatly disappointed. I found the story dull, and the ending extrememly saddening. I cried and cried, but mostly I was upset that the story didn't warrant such a heart tug at the end. And I found myself resentful of the grandfather.Maybe this book is great if you are 6, but not 26.The illustrations are still outstanding."
3,Stone Fox,"The book I am reviewing is Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardner. I gave this book a three star rating. In the book Little Willy's grandfather gets sick. Willy tries to run the farm on his own. In the middle Willy enters a race and if he wins he would get five hundred dollars. I would recommend this book to a friend because it is a good book and it's enjoyable.Emerson, NJ; fifth grade student"
3,review of stone fox,I gave this book a 3 because I sort of liked it and it was sort of boring.I did not like the story that much.The only problem was that grandfather was sick and Little willy needed some money for college.I am glad that little willy won the race though!
5,stone fox,"Stone Fox was all right,because Little Willy's grandfather got sick.When Little Willy knew that his grandfather was sick, he went to work on the farm harvesting the potatoes. I also liked the dog race they had in town. Willy went up against the man himself, Stone Fox the best dog sled racer. T.D."
5,Stone Fox,"I like this story because at the beginning it was funny,a little bit.I think Willy had a lot of courage to try to save Grandpas farmk with the $500 they're givingthe winner of the dog sled race, that's if Willy wins.At the middle it was sad because Grandpa got sick and they almost lost their farm, untilWill won the race. Last, it was very, very, very sad but I can't tell you why because it's a secret. You will have to read the book Stone Fox."
3,Great Adventure,"I give Stone Fox three out of five stars. Stone Fox is by John Reynolds Gardiner. My favorite characters was Willie and Searchlight. This story takes place in Wyoming. There is a big dogsled race and Willie needs [money]so that his grandfather can keep his farm. Willie is racing against Stone Fox, the best one in the race. Stone Fox hasn't lost a race yet. I think this was an o.k. book. I highly recommend this book to a friend or family member."
4,Searchlight,"The book Stone Fox by John Reyndals Gardner was good. My favorite character was Stone Fox. The story took place in Wyoming. One moral of the story was always pay your taxes. I would recommend this book to everyone. Read it from beginning to end. Willy races with just one dog, Searchlight. The other racers had more dogs."
3,Good Book Alert - Stone Fox!,"Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner is a good book. Little Willy's life is becoming a disaster. His grandpa is sick and he doesn't know why. They don't have enough money to pay the bills, either. Then Little Willy finds a way to get a lot of money by winning a dog sled race! Can Little Willy enter and win the race, and will Grandpa get better? This book also has a surprise ending. To figure out the answers to these mysteries, read Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner."
5,stone fox,I gave this book five stars because it is an excellent book.Ten year old Little Willy has a problem.His grandfather is sick and won't get out of bed because he wants to give up on life.I liked the book becauseit is a very good story that teaches you not to give up hope and no matter how small or big you are you can be capable of anything.
3,Unexpected Ending,John Reynolds Gardener's Stone Fox is an okay book. My favorite character was Stone Fox because he helped little Willie with Searchlight. The story took place on a farm in Wyoming. I didn't learn anything I didn't know before. I do recommend this book to a friend because it is an ok book because it had an unexpected ending.
4,Stone Fox,The book I read was Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner. My favorite part was when Willie won the race. My favorite character was Willie because he was the main character. This story took place in Wyoming. Something I learned from this book is to believe you can do it if you try. I recommend this book to people that like to read sad books.
3,yo yo yo check this out bro,"The Book our class read was Stone Fox By John Reynolds Gardiner. My favorite Character was Little Willy. This book takes place in wyoming. I learned that you should always pay your taxes. I would not recommend this book to a friend, but I would read this book again. if you want to know the ending, then you should read this book. Just remember stone fox."
2,Upset child,"This story is very obviously wonderfully written and very touching. However, I am horrified that the dog dies in the end. My daughter is 9 and LOVES animals and she was devastated. I just had to remind her that it was just a story. It was on her summer reading list and I am going to suggest that they change it for next year."
3,Terrible way to promote a dog sled race?,"""In this world nothing is certain but death and taxes."",said Benjamin Franklin.The old man so worried he can give upand the boy with a big heart who doesn't know yet about losing.It makes for a good story,but I don't know what we are teaching childrenif we read this story of courage to them?Is the government right in trying to extract tax from the poor past their ability to pay? Is a democracy any less a tyrant when it does that than King George and his tax on tea?Here the white farmer is set in the clothes of the Indian whose land he stole with the government's help?The ordinary people in America are too often forgotten or taken for granted in their hard work and toil."
1,Difficult reading for younger children,"My great-grandfather was a Sioux Indian, and he would be spinning in his grave at some of the terrible errors in this book. I would imagine that most American school children would know that ""woohitika"" means bravery, and not fortitude (which is, of course ""wowacintanka""). I think you will find that The Great Spirit Skan made us with bones from Stone, and not Brick, like Gardiner would have us believe, and it was Spider that sent Wolf to the Underworld, and not ""Yucky Wucky Stinky Winky Cockroach"". The author has tried hard to create a touching novel about a young boy going through the agonies and indecision of pubescence, and his realtionship with a dog and a virile man much older than himself, but it's the details that let the story down. Finally, it was buffalo that roamed the Great Plains, and not ""lanky legged, boggle eyed giraffes"". Shocking."
3,How Little Willy Saves The Farm,"I read the book Stone Fox by Mary Pope Osborne. I give this book three stars because this is a good story. The book is about a boy named Willy and his dog named Searchlight. They are trying to save the farm. Little Willy is trying to save the farm because the tax man said; ""if they don't give five hundred dollars he is going to take the farm away."" Little Willy enters a race and the prize money is five hundred dollars. The guns go off, they start the race. Is Little Willy going to win and save the farm? Read and find out. I would recommend this book to a friend because it's exciting.Emerson New Jersey 5th Grade Student"
2,I don't Recomed Stone Fox.,"I am doing a book review on Stone Fox by John Reynolds Gardiner. This book is about a young boy, Little Willy, who lives with is grandfather on a farm. One day his Grandfather gets sick and is not able to work the farm. Little Willy is determined to earn ""the money"" to pay for the back taxes on the farm. If you want to find out if Little Willy succeeds in his mission and his grandfather gets better, read this book."
4,A really good book!,"I think that Stone Fox is a wonderful book. When we were reading this book in my class, I didn't want to stop. If I don't understand a part, I can keep reading until it makes sense. I think that Willie is a very kind boy because he wants to take care of his grandfather. He wants to make money on his potato farm so that he can pay the tax collector. Now do you want to read the book?[...]"
5,stone fox,great book for 7-10 year olds. my grandson loved it. surprise ending that made it much more powerful and memorable
4,Best For Those Experienced In The Use Of Homeopathy,"This book is a good resource for those with some experience in the use of homeopathic remedies. It's definitely not the first book on homeopathy you should be reading, as it will not tell you how to take a case, choose the most appropriate remedy, select potency and repetitions, and recognize signs of a cure or partial cure as well as the signs of suppression or a noncurative aggravation. For an excellent introduction to veterinary homeopathy, check out books by Dr. Don Hamilton and Dr. Christopher Day.Dr. Macleod's book lists some of the major remedies for a large variety of canine ailments (arranged according to body system) with a brief description of the symptom picture that would call for a particular remedy. Of course the list of remedies is not exhaustive and this book is not intended to substitute for looking up the remedies in a comprehensive materia medica."
4,Well worth reading,"This book gives an interesting view of the law as seen in the writings of Paul. I like how the author rejects both Calvinist and Arminian systems and plows a furrow down the middle of them both while remaining faithful to the Bible. His point about the necessity of a general atonement for assurance is very interesting, and convincing. I also appreciate his insights on introspection; it is indeed very destructive to the doctrine of assurance. I also recommend Zane Hodges' book ""Absolutely Free! A Biblical Reply to Lordship Salvation""."
4,Great mystery book for young kids,My daughter was first introduced to the Uncle Tooth and Otto Adventures when she was three years old. She's now 5 and a half and still loves them. The Secret of Foghorn Island is wonderful for young children who love mysteries. My daughter recently let her kindergarten class borrow her copy for story time. The teacher said that all the kids really enjoyed it. This book and the rest of the series have wonderful characters and stories that will entertain the reader as well as any young listeners. All in all this is a wonderful book as are all the Uncle Tooth and Otto Adventures.
5,No gloom and doom here!,"As a recently diagnosed Type 2 diabetic, I am looking for lots of information on how to manage the disease in a healthy, positive manner. This book has really helped me. Author Leontos clearly explains the challenges in store but emphasizes positive ways to react. I particularly like her information on modifying recipes. This book is a real bargain for all the help you get!"
2,Don't waste your time,"I did not find this book informative. It basically dealt with folks who, while their sugar was high, were experimenting with what to eat and how it effected their sugar. These people were not on medication."
4,Definitely a MUST-SEE movie to understand Mexico's student issues of today!,"This is a movie based on the tragedy occured on the evening of October 2nd of 1968. You are introduced to a middle class family which is divided by the political vision and ideas between the parents and their teenage kids. The movie shows you the life of an unfortunate family which is placed in the wrong place at the wrong time.Being ten days before the Olympic Games take place in Mexico City, the Government wishes to finish a strike held by students at different schools throughtout the city. A strike that has been going on for more than 3 months. Knowing that an end to this problem is needed, the Secretary of State gives an advice to the President on how to "" finish "" with such problem, who approves the idea.You'll feel a sense of anger and sadness, but a story such as this is good to know, for we do not need another day like this. EVER! Long Live the Freedom of Speech and the Students' Respect and Rights FOREVER!"
2,An Altered Vision,"IT IS BASED ON FACTUAL EVENTS IN MEXICO CITY 1968. It is a fine movie, and well done. But please do not expect more than drama. There is more to it than the maker's limited vision of what happend, how it happend, to who it happened to, and most imnportantly why it happened and why people rebeled. Don't take this flick to heart it is only a movie. Paz lo mis compañeros."
5,En español,"Una excelente película que te envuelve en la experiencia aterradora que seguramente tuvieron muchas familias mexicanas ese 2 de octubre. No es una película acerca del suceso histórico, sino la historia de una familia común y corriente que le tocó presenciar esa masacre."
5,Excellent!,"This is one of the best treatments of journalism I've ever read. It is both a gripping historical narrative (with an excellent chapter on how the New York Times covered lynching) and a serious intellectual history of an idea central to journalism: how journalists started to think of themselves as objective. At its core, it is also a cultural history of the nineteenth century. Perhaps this review makes the book sound like it's a bit of everything, but the chapters are focused and interesting. I recommend it to anyone interested in journalism and/or intellectual history."
1,The subjective history of an idea,"David Mindich begins and ends his book with the assertion that objectivity, and the particular instance of journalistic objectivity, are myths that no one believes in outside of contemporary newsrooms. These inter-related assertions of opinion sandwich a historical analysis of how ""objectivity"" came to be the guiding ethic of American journalism. Unfortunately, apart from a glib reference to Jaques Derrida, and a terribly mistaken point on Albert Einstein, Mindich completely avoids addressing the considerable history of philosophical objectivity in the same historical time-frame. So we end up with a book about a profound philosophical issue reaching philosophical conclusions but absent any real philosophy. Irritating, yes - but also rather ironic: so inimical is ""objectivity"" to Mindich, he has to forgo any objective claim for the truth of what he says to prevent falling into self-contradiction. Ooops."
5,Great tool for Massage Therapists,This book is a great tool for Massage Therapist. The information is clear and easily understood. Helps take the guesswork out of assessment of certain conditions.I highly urge anyone that does therapeutic massage to own one.
3,Cute but really thin.,"This towel is really cute, my wife loved it. The only quarrel I have it how cheap the towel is. Very very thin. I don't expect it to last very long before it starts to get holes in it."
4,I can only further-recommend!,"about the film one can argue, but the picture in hp DVD absolutely the hammer!"
2,Interesting But There Is One Better,I didn't like this film as much as I did United 93 and I would recommend that you purchase United 93 instead.
3,Disappointed in this movie,"I was very disappointed in this movie. I purchased it just because I thought it should belong in one's movie collection. With all the deaths associated with the fallen Trade Centers and the Iraqi War aftermath, it was hard to give that much importance to these two lives. The movie cover is great. The movie does not live up to the cover."
1,horrible movie,"i don't get all the good reviews..this movie was horrible..talk about cashing in on a horrible event of our time. nicholas cage is the most overated actor ever. you can tell he's overacting in every movie he does. this movie had me fast forwarding most of the time..don't waste your time..it's basically a 2 hour movie with 2 guy trapped under rocks.. if you want to watch a movie about 9 11, watch the real thing..and see in memoriam..not this crap"
1,Disappointed,"When I pirchased this movie I though that it would be like a beginning to end movies about the destruction and the people who worked at the World Trade Center. I was very disappointed in the movie and would not recommed it to any one.Marilyn A. DillardI wish I could send it back, but I guess you do not accept returns."
1,Exploitation of a tragedy,"I refuse to see this film. I am offended that so many people feel that it is in any way respectful to anyone impacted by the events of 9/11. It is a typical Hollywood scheme to get rich off of something that should never be considered for profit, particularly since so little time has passed. One might point out that profits were donated to charities, but what is left out is that it was 10% of profits from the first five days the film was open in theaters. This means that 90% of profits (as in everything on top of the ridiculous salaries for most involved) go straight to the pockets of Paramount Studios. At least Cage donated a decent chunk to the Red Cross. I for one refuse to contribute to such a blatant exploitation of thousands that died."
1,"A long Nicholas Cage, Tear Fest, with a touch of War Propagnada",The victims so this terrible destruction deserve better.
4,a great adaptation.,i liked this movie a lot but every time i would watch it i'd cry. keep a box of kleenex on hand when watching this. you will need it. for sure
3,from titanic to trade centers,"If you like the titanic, then this is for you.The titanic was also a horrible event, with large amounts of victims, if not more.Both movies get into the personal lives of the casting members, although 911 was very deliberate, both titanic and trade center events took place due to neglagence and not just human error.If your attempting to do research on some historical facts pertaining to the events surrounding 911, then I DONOT recommend this flick.It is also unfortunate to have a male cocassion playing the role of a black marine who went on a night vigil for victims to resue.It would appear that this is just another hit-piece made to order by the global elite who wish not to be known for owning the financial institutions of this present evil world.OPERATION MOCKINGBIRD (Google it!)"
1,what?!! where are the brave firemen in this movie?!!,"WTC events that day was not JUST about 2 policemen, but all of us: firemen, people, workers, cops. Movie don't show how brave those firemen were risking their lives.. Its over 2hrs of just 2 cops stuck in the rubble.. Its just like saying United 93 had only 2 brave men to stop the terrosrists.."
5,it's an awesome movie after all,"it is very true & realistic about the event that occured on Sept. 11 2001 , it will jerk some tears , garunteed"
4,Great!!!,This is an awesome movie. I recommend it. This movie is made even better if seen in high definition. I gotta say I love the HD revolution. It's almost as good as being in a theater.
2,Disappointing,"After all the hype, I was disappointed with this movie. I fully appreciate the horrow these two families endured while waiting for news of thier loved ones but I was a little shocked that only two family stories were covered. It seems much of the movie was spent watching the two trapped officers. I didn't expect history to be re-written but a more comprehensive look at the events of the day would have been nice."
4,Very well crafted.,"Oliver Stone has made a very compelling and respectful portrayalof one of the most inspiring stories of survival in our time.I've seen a lot of movies in my life and this one is one of the fewthat have stayed with me for days after seeing it. I was engaged frombeginning to end. World Trade Center also feels like one of Stone'searlier films like Salvador or Platoon.Very raw.There are a few minor flaws. The only complaint I have is the portrayalof Staff Sargeant Karnes. It simply stands out too much in comparisonto the natural portrayal of the rest of the characters.This is still a good film and an important film. Anybody who snubsStone for not making the conspiracy film they expect from him need toget over it and see this. If he wanted to make a conspiracy film hewould have. He wanted to spread some hope. How could anyone have a problem with that? Thank you,Oliver!"
5,"Like an elephant, never, EVER forget!","I cannot even begin to imagine what went on under the fireman hats that day, but this jewel of a movie, with an all-star cast, gives me a dammed good idea."
3,"Not Oliver's best, but still not bad.","So I had seen this movie a while ago in theaters. I've always liked Oliver Stone films (i.e. Platoon, J.F.K, and Born on the Fourth of July). I thought that this film was a little under rated. Granted it's not his best, but is still one of Stone's better, recent films. The film has a lot of heart, and celebrates the American spirit on a day when it seemed like it was almost lost. A very moving, and touching film."
5,it was excellent,i bought this movie because i thought it might be good but when i watched it it was way way better then i thought it would be. i cried and cried watching this movie and for a guy that is pretty unusual.for all you people out there never go by other reviewers. you have to see it for yourself. thank you.
3,7 Years Later...,"It has been 7 years since that tragic day. I was in sixth grade when it happened. None of our teachers told us anything, so my dad told me about it, and I didn't know what to think!Nicolas Cage stars as Port Authority police officer John McLoughlin, and his friend, Will Jimeno who become trapped in the rubble of the World Trade Center. They struggle to survive and wait to be rescued. If you are a patriot, hate terrorists, and want to take a huge dump in Osama Bin Laden's mouth, you'll like WORLD TRADE CENTER!!!"
5,It was amazing!,"Yea I know, whose going to listen to a kids review right? but I probably know more about this movie than you adults who say that it's 'too raw' and 'not right' and whatever. If its too raw- don't see it. No ones forcing it to you because if you'll recall, there were very few commericals for this movie and if you wanted to see it you could but if you didn't you could go back to your normal lives in the matter of 3 minutes after seeing a commercial. I'm not saying this isn't an emotional movie because it is but all I'm saying is that everyone should give it a chance because its more about the survival, courage and compassion in that day than the evil that it is infamous for.This was an amazing movie and I believe that everyone should go see it:)"
4,A Hit or a Near Miss?,"Despite any shared feelings, 9-11 was a different experience for each individual who read, watched or in any way participated in it. In order to connect to this movie, we have to be able to find something that resonates with what it meant to us. Oliver Stone maybe was not as successful as we, would like. Or was he? I am not sure WE know what it meant to us. It is difficult to capture the sense of this or any other complexly incomprehensible event in a feature length movie, particularly in a film done only a few years after the towers fell...there has been insufficient time and distance. If we watch WTC in the hopes of coming to a comfortable understanding and resolution, we will be disappointed. If we see it as part of the process of negotiating the inconsistencies of life, it met its goal."
2,What's up with those accents?,I thought the movie was just okay ... I was distracted by the actors trying too hard to capture the New York and North Jersey accents - seemed exaggerated not natural. The story itself could be about ANY two people trapped in ANY horrific catastrophe and ANY family's ordeal (boring); reminded me of the miners' rescue. Most interesting fact: out of the 20 people that were rescued these two guys were #18 and #19 making me want to know more or remembering from the news about the other 18 and their experiences.
2,Very much lacking emotionally,"I was disappointed in this movie. It failed to capture the emotion of 9/11 in my opinion. The only portion that actually gave me a twinge of remembrance was when the stretchers were lifted out and handed down the long row of rescue workers. I do like that it recognized the often overlooked sacrifices of the PAPD and I thought the woman who played Jimeno's wife did a fabulous job. Other than that, I could have slept through most of the movie. I can't quite put my finger on what was missing for me.If you want something that really captures the emotion of that day, try United 93 instead."
2,9/11 a mere prop,"Ultimately, the movie had little to do with 9/11 as it did with human persistence in the face of dire and tragic circumstances. The disaster that trapped the heroes/victims could have just as easily been a mine collapse. Thus, there were no insights into the 9/11 disaster other than the obvious ones, merely and briefly alluded to, that first responders were sorely prepared for it. An altogether average film in the context of an extraordinary event."
1,Can I get a refund for World Trade Center?,"How could Oliver Stone and Nicholas Cage work on a story that literally changed America and NOT have a ""signifcant film"" and a sure fire Oscar Winner? Perhaps Stone was a victim of a global conspiracy. As far as Nicholas Cage, he was totally underutilized and useless as basically a lump under some rubble with his best line being, ""I don't talk much."" Obviously, of the films budget slated for actors, the lion's share went to Cage since there were no other recognizable actors of significance. The script was so abyssmal it lead to a seemingly endless movie that just plodded along. The best thing I can say about this movie was that it was over and I could place the DVD in trash were it belongs.World Trade Center (Widescreen Edition)"
1,Not giving HOLLYWOOD 1 cent...,"I refuse to see this, mainly because I lived it and saw everything with my own 2 eyes. It's a shame that hollywood will make a profit from such a tragedy."
2,The World trade Center,I didn't like this movie. I know the story of 9/11 was a good one but i didnt think that this movie honored 9/11. i thought the acting was ok but the movie just focused on 2 guys and thats pretty much the whole movie. If i were you this movie is only to rent but not buy.
1,totally unrealistic,"This is a ridiculous disaster movie about some buildings in New York city that collapse mysteriously. Two of the buildings are actually hit by airplanes before they mysteriously collapse.Another building mysteriously collapses without even being struck by an airplane. Give me a break. Oliver Stone does not even attempt to explain why these buildings collapsed.If you want to see a more realistic disaster movie about tall buildings, rent The Towering Inferno."
2,Lacks a soul.,"World Trade Center directed by Oliver Stone showed promise in the first 30 minutes but after that, this film lacked a heart and soul. The all-star cast are expectionally talented but the true-life survivors they are portraying seem so fake and unsympathetic. Oliver Stone was such a great director but his ""masterpieces"" have suffered greatly in over a decade, I can't remember a flawless film he's created in such a long time, it's so sad. If you want a film that is truly a tribute to the courageous heroes of 9/11 then I highly recommend United 93 instead. That film is perfect from beginning to end."
3,Trade Center DOWN!!!,"Although I did find myself with tears in my eyes, thought this was going to be a much more powerful movie. It did not show the events leading up, the full effect of the falling, or the drama of the people affected. The time of the two Police Officers caught was not captured to the point of complete moving actions on the actors parts. Did not understand how long they were barried. Also the street shots were nowhere near as devasting as shown on TV during the real happening."
4,World Trade Center,"I have not watched it yet, but I remember when this actually happened but I am sure the movie goes into more details then CNN or FoxNews did."
2,Not That Good,The story line is a good one if you are into the 9/11 thing. But the movie just plain stunk.
1,YAWN,"Perhaps Stone's worse movie...Oh plenty of ""drama""...the movie's only goal was to make to you know something you already did...people suffered that day!But im sure it will make tons of cash on dvd because its mindless dribble with nick cage as the head dribbler..his performance was ok,obvious he took the role with seriousness.I just cant see any reason to buy it,even watch it for that reason...It has no purpose other than to take your money,it doesnt explore,explain,or even encourage debate or thought."
3,The horrors of 9/11,"This movie traces the story of two Port Authority Policemen, played by Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena, who attempt to rescue survivors of 9/11 at the World Trade Center. After they enter the building, it collapses and they are trapped in the rubble. They talk to each other to keep up their courage, but it is evident that they are badly injured. The movie shows flashbacks of the men and their families and also shows the agony their wives are going through as they wait for word of their husbands. The script never properly develops the two main characters in the viewer's mind and this detracts from the overall emotional impact which the movie could have had. However, the movie does have merit and it serves as a tribute to those who risked and lost their lives in this tragedy."
5,A Film About Courage and Triumph,"World Trade Center, a film about the rescue of two police officers who were trapped under the rubble of the Twin Towers on America's Second Day of Infamy, is a film of courage and triumph. It is, in a way, a shout of defience against the terrorists. You have taken many lives on that day, but not these lives. And you have brought out the best in us.And the great miricle of the film is that it was made by Oliver Stone, known better as the perveyor of the dark, paranoid side of the American experience. It is as if someone had taken over the body and mind of the creator of Platoon and JFK and made a film that celebrated patriotism and traditional values, things one would think Stone was innocent of.This film deserves to be seen by every human being. And if that happens, perhaps Hollywood will realize that it doesn't have to insult their audience to make a good film."
3,"Nice Look, Cheap Construction",These are a big pain to get the pin into the hoop to latch them. They bend and it makes it very difficult. They do look nice though.
3,I like comedy better but the swearing made me laugh as much,"Crosses is a different book, it really is if you compare it to any other. I read it maybe 1 month ago but I can still remember it as if it happened to a close friend of mine. I'm really not the type like Nancy, especially not Katie. As I read the begginning, I was actually scared that I would start doing the same(cutting myself) because the book describes every single thing very carefully and that stuckin my mind cuz I never heard of that). But it didn't so cool because I wouldn't want to loose my best friend like Nancy lost Katie. Crosses made me realise how other teens cope with this everyday. And I learned a couple of things at the same time. One of them is a bad word that I think is funny: shithead!(I never heard that one before)Crosses is a very dark and depressing book. But intresting in a mentaly twisting way."
4,Eye opening,"This book made me relize that not all the people in this world are as sheltered as I am. I consider myself to be the no drugs no ""bad things"" person. But this book really opened my eyes to things that happen in some peoples day to day life. I was shocked at the content at first but then I came to terms with it. I wonder if the author's teenage years were similar to the books. The way she wrote made it seem as though it was writen from personal experiance."
1,I liked a lot of the book but thought the plot was poor.,"The book kept my attention for most of the time, but I was dissapointed in the ending. Not only did the author, in my opinion, leave it hanging, but it seemed quite surreal. All in all, I thought the book's plot and characters were a bit sketchy, although many of the feelings and thoughts expressed were somewhat believeable if not seemingly true to life. A fair book."
5,"I think that this was an excellent book, very real.","I read this book about a year ago and i still think about things in the book that happened. It was a very chilling book because it is so real. I felt like i related to Nancy in some ways because when you're reading it you get so into the story, you forget it's only a book. I thought it was a very good book and I would definitely reccommend it to others."
2,A disappointment,"I thought this book was going to be about self-injury (SI), but it was more about Nancy and Katie's drug problems and sexual experimentation. It was a good book from that aspect, but it was misinformed about SI. Granted, there are people who SI who also take drugs and get into risky sexual situations, but this book seemed almost to say that one must be really messed up to SI . I think people who SI do have a lot of problems, but they don't have to be quite so self- destructive as Nancy and Katie. Also, I think it's a shame that Crosses was marketed as a book about SI when in fact it was really about almost every kind of self- destructive behavior. And the critics seem to think that it's a pretty good book about SI. When there aren't many informed books about SI on the market, it's easy to think this way. I guess I just didn't see myself in Nancy and Katie's thoughts or behaviors- as someone who has SIed (and I didn't see my friends who SI in them either)."
5,I love this book!,"i could really relate to everything in this book. haha, i know. must be pretty messed up eh? well...i really dont read that much, but this book was really interesting. i couldnt put it down and read it in two days. and thats really good for me, being stupid and all. haha. anyway. fabulous book!"
3,Crosses by Shelley Stoehr,"I didn't really like it because the principle character got on my nerves by the way she talked and the way she acted. The book had a sad end, and I don't like those books, so personally I didn't liked. However, I have to say that the book had a good perspective on the crude life of a teenager. The way that the teenagers talked was so real. They used slang like we do and acted like we do."
2,I didn't like this book at all,"I'm a thirteen year old cutter, yeah i admit it whatever. anyway i've taken to drinking too but for a teacher to let you off the hook because your a good student? gimme a break! teachers get fired and wouldn't cover for a student even if they did like them. I' ve never taken drugs but why were they the only ones doing it? I mean there are more potheads than just two per school. What i didn't like was how stoehr went about the cutting in her story. At one point she says "" i could stop anytime i wanted to i just don't"" or something like that. But cutting is just as bad as being addicted to pot you can't give it up easily. That's whats so bad about it. I've tried to stop so many times and i don't want professional help but see i try but i never completely get rid of it. That point in the book was what threw me off, That's what i didn't like about it. The book didn't seem like she had researched about what she was writting. I just didn't like it."
2,gah,"I was glued to this book...however, I am a self-injurer and can honestly say that at most times in the book that self-injury was mentioned, it was in a nonrealistic way that aggrivated me. On one page, the main character mentions something about how it was always possible to stop the SI. I cannot say how incredibly wrong that statement was and how much it aggrivated me. If you SI, you will find false statements in the book that may irritate you beyond belief. False book."
5,"Raw, Real, Excellent for reading, even adults.","i read this book a year or 2 ago, and i was glued to the pages. i also related to the main characters quite a bit. for anyone who has problems with self mutilation, pleasepleaseplease go get help. i wouldn't say i'm a success story, but i can say that you're not alone, and the more you read, study, and watch about it the more you understand, and the more it could help you. empower yourself. don't become a victim.recommended material: bodies under seige (lots by dr. favazza). movies: all over me, foxfire. there is also another book i own about an ice skater who cuts herself, but i've forgotten the title. it's by dr. steve levenkron. he also does another book about self-mutilation."
4,Really really easy to relate to.,i've read this book about a million times in the past 3 years. but right now it's really easy to relate to. except the drugs and reckless behavior towards family and friends and school. but the main issue sticks with you. it finally feels like someone understands you. but it's not a game. the characthers sometimes say it's fun. it is not fun. and i don't particularly love the end and how Nancy's atitude magically changes. that is not reality.
1,A Travesty!,"And what a massive letdown that was! I mean, for a book that's supposed to burst stereotypes, it certainly does a great job of doing just the opposite, and reinforcing negative generalizations. It had so much potential as a book to be powerful and moving and everything a good book needs, but it was wasted on a bunch of fake gothy teens sitting around doing drugs all the time. Just...seriously, a waste. The ideas for a good plot were endless, and yet, what comes out as the end result is a story with no plot at all. No resolution, nothing near resolution, no happy, no sad, just boring teens with boring unrealistic lives that makes you have NO sympathy. There are so many effective ways to portray a story like this, where did Stoehr go so horribly wrong?"
2,To Stereotypical,"Crosses is about a girl named Nancy, who takes on the punk lifestyle, with friend katie and boyfriend Mike. She deals with drug abuse, and alcohol abuse. She was a good student in school and now she isn't, she gets rid of mental pain by using physical pain in cutting. It is basicly about how screwed up her life is. I didn't like the book, it is mostly lies, sayin that punks are all druggies, and alcoholics. I am a punk and I truthfully am not a druggie, anc/or an alcoholic. I am a punk and thebook i to stereotypical, for people who don't understand punks, and read it, they will think that we have a bad impression upon us."
5,Father Seraphim,"A magical book, with a beautiful and special destiny. You will meet a man in it's pages, more closely related with our modern lives than you could even imagine:""and when the wind of autumn stirsthe dieing leaves and we must partwe'll hold some meaning in the heartunspoken, since we both believedin Him who in His love has broughtfrom out of silence, out of naughtthe universe that He conceived""Father Seraphim Rose"
2,Record Producer review,"I have been using Digital Orchestra Plus for several years. Although a little difficult to get used to ,works pretty well for general music arranging.Record Producer is similar with expanded features.There are some features such as adding signs and symbols into the notation that wouls be helpful.The program is still useful for the average amature arranger."
1,Be wary of buying this product!!!,"Be wary of buying this product. It is very difficult to use and even the simplest things seem to be a problem. When I use the software, the registration page seems to pop up even after I registered. I also had problems getting technical support help. There is no phone support, and the website and FAQ is severly lacking in any help. Save your money!"
1,too much hype ... too little tech support,"Bought RPDlx to record midi + vocals and burn to audio CD. Using new Gateway it loads install CD, but when we try to ""burn"" an audio CD the software tells us we have no CD! If you read their manual (http://www.turtlebeach.com/products/record-producer-deluxe/downloads.aspx) you'll discover on page 44 of 46 a small disclamer stating they don't support some CD's (but nothing letting you know which ones). Despite emails and faxes to their tech support we have heard nothing and cannot fully use the product.Also, the user manual is so poorly written that it took us days just to figure out how to create an MP3 file ... I'd suggest you pass on this and try something else."
3,"A tad heavy-handed at times, but good when it isn't.","Melissa Murray, Changelings (Attic Press, 1987)A debut collection of short stories from an Irish writer better known for her theater work. Changelings is what it advertises-a book of stories about people (and, occasionally, the odd nonhuman) going through changes. The stories here range from science fiction to that morass known as ""eighties fiction,"" the plotless look at a character or characters with whom no one who actually reads books can identify; as you might guess, this makes the book inconsistent. When it is good, though, it does what it does and it does it well. You'll find yourself skimming some of the stories, but it's worth picking up for the ones you don't. **"
4,Funny,What more can be said over all a fair story line; it has some life lessons in it as well as comedy. There was a lot that was unrealistic but all in all the comedy flows well throughout and there are a few life lessons it presents in a fun way that you can learn from. All in all I'd have to rate this as a pretty good movie.
2,Was disappointed,Got this when the price went down. Both my 4 year old and I were disappointed. Not very funny. neither of us has the interest to finish watching it.
2,"Rent it, don't buy it","This movie isn't good, but it isn't that bad either. I love Jim Carrey, but he seemed tired in this movie. The plot - the leading man learns that what is really important in life is love and family - is a good, if not common, theme. My biggest problem, though, was it wasn't very funny - I watched it with 10-12 year olds who laughed very little overall. As an adult, I didn't feel anything for the characters in the family as they just weren't developed enough. Instead of going all the way and making it laugh out loud hiliarious on the penguin front, it seems they tried to try the safe middle ground of some laughs and some family ""gooeyness"". Mmmmm, gooey.This is an okay movie for younger kids, and worth a watch, but I doubt you'd want to see it more than once. So just rent it."
2,Package was damaged.,"When I received the package it was damaged, however the movie does work. But the package was all wet and the stuff penguin was ruined, the dvd case was broken. Not real happy with the product but didn't complain since the movie worked. I would be very cautious ordering again."
3,Fun but forgettable.,"I brought this movie when it was released at full price, but only got to watching it today(at which point, it's obviously come down in price by quite a bit). I'd probably have been happier with this movie if I hadn't paid full price for it - it's fun, but forgettable. Although it kept me entertained (the penguins were cute!), I didn't laugh once and found the plot very predictable. I've seen Jim Carey in the role of ""neglectful father"" before, and felt that this made his character seem too similar to ones I'd seen him play in other movies.But, ah well. It was fun, but forgettable. I'd have been harsher if it wasn't for the penguins - they were so cute and fun that I couldn't help at least smiling at this movie."
5,Humor to relax by,Movie is predictable but that is ok. It keeps you laughing and just plain fun. Light and entertaining. Don't have to think.
1,Didn't know what to think.,"I like Jim Carrey, but I don't understand Hollywood's obsession with penguins. I don't recommend to anyone tired of the MPAA's same old garbage."
3,Great for kids!,"Jim Carrey was in fine form. Not even the penguins could upstage him. But, I found it odd that the director felt the need to convey so many moral messages in this film. I guess this is what passes for ""family entertainment"" these days. I think the film would have been more fun if they just simply let the penguins ""fly,"" as the Captain finally did. Instead, Mark Waters felt the need to bring the family back together, culminating in a wild rescue scene and the ""feel good"" ending you can imagine. No surprises here, other than what Mr. Popper found in those ice boxes. Great for kids."
1,very predictable,"Jim carrey has done some good stuff, but this is not one of his best, or even one of his tolerable films. The plot is formulaic, predictable, and pandering. It's clearly an attempt by this studio to cash in on the fame of Jim Carrey with a pathetic movie."
2,Interesting Idea + Mixed-Result Special Effects + Poor Execution = A boring movie,"I watched this in the theatre. The special effects produce mixed results. The penguins look life-like in some scenes and drawing-like in some others. The idea is interesting. Penguins look cute. So, what will happen if a person makes them his pets? However, there is no funny scene for me. I got bored after watching it for 30 minutes.I feel ""The March of Penguins"" is more heart-warming. One of the reasons is the penguins look real. The other is the story is funnier at times. The hardship that the penguins have to endure to give birth is so touching."
4,Surprise,"An excellent family flick. Got kind of goofy in a few spots, but those are brief. More importantly, it brings up a few questions of ""what if"" for the different members in your household."
3,Mr Popper,Thought it was a good family movie. I am sure children would like it. Reccomend it for a good evening at home movie!
5,A must for Jim Carrey fans.,Delightful film that can be enjoyed by anyone of any age. Watch it with your children and be delighted with it yourself.
4,My little boy laughed all the way through it.,I am not a big Drew Carey fan and the plot of this movie is not exactly realistic but watching my little boy laugh at the penguin antics was worth it. This is a cute family movie that has enough funny parts to overcome the dumb plot and unoriginal side stories.
3,Not such a good movie...,"Mr. Popper's Penguins definitely wasn't one of Jim Carrey's top vehicles, but it was watchable. Although targeted toward adults, the situations seemed to be geared toward the teen crowd. I probably won't be watching this one again for a number of years...if ever. If you have younger people in your household (or you happen to be one), you may enjoy this rather odd movie. Lots of reviews out there so I don't have to repeat everything. Jim Carrey didn't do it for me this time, but I'm still a fan."
5,So awesome!,I really enjoyed this movie. I found it to be very sweet and touching. My fave part was when the bird crashed the lady's party. My fave penguin was Lovey. Jim was just awesome in this film.
4,Jim Carey is great,"I always love Jim Carey. Great family movie, lots of laughs. No profainity used or sexual scenes. I also liked that it had a happily ever after ending."
4,Enjoyable for the whole family,This movie was funny for the whole family. Jim Carrey is his usual goofy funny self. The penguins were sweet. A great family night movie.
3,Alright,"Cute, family film. Not Jim Carey's typical funny film, but watchable. Very unrealistic concept that you could turn an apartment into a whole winter wonderland."
4,Kids loved this and howled with laughter,My kids 4-8 howled with laughter. Very entertaining for the wee bairns.I would recommend this for a family movie night.
4,Mr. Poppers Penguins,I had wanted to watch this movie for a long time as I had seen the advertisements on TV. It was very funny and creative.
3,Papa Popper's Aptenodytes Patagonicus,A profoundly peculiar production possessing a predictably pleasing plot perplexingly polluted by a progressively pitiful proliferation of playful penguin potty pranks preferably not previewed previous to the plentiful procurement and palatably pleasant processing of predominantly popped popcorn.
3,Good family movie,"Love the Tavern on the Green in the movie. The outside as well as the end is a wonderland in it's self. Very cute interactions withJim and the penguins. A little over the top in places, but worth a view."
5,"Cute, Zany Entertainment!","Looking for a cute, zany, 94 minutes of pure entertainment? If so, your search can stop at ""Mr. Poppers Penguins.""Jim Carrey portrays Mr. Popper, a driven, ambitious real estate mogul until he inherits a flock of penguins from his explorer father. Quickly drawn to these adorable creatures, Mr. Popper's life changes as his bachelor condo become a frozen penguin habitat. There Mr. Popper finds what is really important in life, love and family. Don't miss it!"
5,one of the best moive in a long time,i funny movie i seen in a while..a great story line with a good endingsome ok action in the movie but it great for kids and adults to watch together
4,Okay,I also got this movie last christmas for a friend. It came in great condition but the movie it's self wasn't that great.
3,Cute Family movie,Very Cute & funny family movie. It is great for the kids and is motivational for adults with a lesson to be learned. I would recommend this movie for any family and/or couple that wants a fun-loving movie to watch.
1,Funny but very very empty,"I'd hate to say that as a Jim Carrey fan that I really don't care for his newest role... but I don't care for him in this film. I was hoping the film would at least feel like a comedy but it ended up falling flat on it's fins.Short: DO NOT WATCH! YOUR KIDS WOULD PROBABLY HATE PENGUINS AFTER THIS FILM. I'm serious folks, this ones a beaker."
5,great family movie,Great movie for movie night with the family. My young special needs friend is enjoying this movie immensely. Mucn enjoyed by all!
5,Granddaughter loved it.,I purchased this with the little plush toy for a Christmas gift and it was a hit! Cute show.I always buy a movie with new PJS for their Christmas Eve present and both grandkids reallyenjoyed the movie.
4,a delightful magic tale,"In this gentle story of a white rabbit who magically appears from a magician's hat, the rabbit learns he can do many magic tricks with this special hat, including making a picnic with his favorite foods. But he's missing a friend to share it with. After pulling out a frog, mice, and birds from his hat, who all jump, scurry, or fly away, he finally discovers another magic hat inside with another bunny who becomes his special friend. Friendship, we learn, is the best magic of all. This striking picture book is illustrated with vibrantly colored oil paintings which leap out at the reader, capturing the jumping movements of the rabbits. The use of extreme close-up is especially effective. The simple and short text is suitable for the youngest readers and is well-paced for story time use. This title could be used for a story time on friendship, one on magic, or on rabbits. Highly recommended, especially for 2 to 5 year olds."
4,Happenstance happens,"This is a really good book. I purchased this book as part of a college course in rehabilitation counseling. It gives great examples and explanation of this vocational approach to career and life development. It is easy to understand, read and apply. I truly recommend this book for those who are interested in understanding this vocational orientation to life, career development."
5,A recommended picturebook story that is certain to delight preschool through first grade boys and girls,The Tooth Fairy is out of money and there are still a great many children to serve! Can she come up with something really creative for the little tykes? Or is she going to be the first Tooth Fairy in the history of fairydom to fail! John Robbins' quite clever and original story is wonderfully enhanced with the bright and energetic artwork of Rae Owings in this enthusiastically recommended picturebook story that is certain to delight preschool through first grade boys and girls.
3,Good but not great,"An interesting, occasionally absorbing view of a poly-lingual writer's far-flung life, with special insights into his youth and adolescence in a Jewish artistic family in Mexico, but in the end superficial and narcissistic."
1,"On Borrowed Words, February 20, 2006","I read this book and I found that the author had been extremely careless in its writing. Even though it is an autobiography, the author makes reference to ""historic facts"" which are false. If this book reflects the author's cavalier attitude towards accuracy (in historic facts as well as in language accuracy) then this book casts a shadow on the author's intellectual integrity. Otherwise the book is an ""easy read"" and it is entertaining."
3,Garage rock 'n' soul,"Their sound is like something out of the mid-sixties, with Fogerty-like swamp guitars, horns that belong on old stax records, and a Fender Rhodes piano sound I haven't heard in years. I would give this a higher rating but it's a little thin in places and some songs have a lounge-jazz feel. Still, all-in-all, a good CD to have in your collection."
5,chinese law and government,"this book is very useful and informative..it's not a common publication,but as a long time student of chinese language history and culture,i use this book almost daily"
2,Medium-strength fanfic,"I was worried when I saw the author's long ""thank-you"" list, and I was right. This one has its moments, but disappointed overall. McCoy is my favorite and I was looking forward to a narrative from his POV, but he felt out-of-character the whole time so it was a waste. He talks way too much, as if he were in charge, and nobody calls him on it. It's like the author wrote a Mary Sue for McCoy, trying to insert him at every possible moment, and it doesn't work at all. His grumpiness is overdone and annoying, not charming. In general the dialogue is wordy and unrealistic for all characters, which outweighs a nice, spooky plot. Sorry not to be able to recommend this one."
2,So little of value,"I'm fairly surprised this novel was published. There's nothing wrong with the writing - in fact the writer creates some very vivid images. But, I'd rather read a poem or Shakespeare if that's what I'm looking for. I honestly felt this book could have been written without losing any plot or value in less than 20 pages.Simply put, nothing happens! I read most of the ST series, and this one was among the hardest to have to pick up and read a few pages at a time. If you enjoy deep and detailed images into the primary character's minds, you might really enjoy this story. If, however, you are like me and enjoy some action, some sci-fi and some intreque, this book falls far short. Seriously - at one point, over 150 pages had gone by and the away team had moved two decks with absolutely no change to anything in the plot!I didn't hate it, and Trek is Trek, but this was among the bottom 10 of all the ST books I've read. At least it's just one book and not a multi-part series."
3,Not As Good As It Could Have Been,"It was an OK book. Not great, but OK. The premise was not bad, but could have been done better. One thing I liked was the fact that, even though its another Kirk-Verses-Romulans book, theres some originality."
3,The Enterprise and the Romulans play a deadly game.,A typical Star Trek original novel with Kirk and company versus the Romulans.Throw in a derelict space station for a plot twist.Not as outstanding as others in the series.
4,"suspense, science, courage, discovery and romulans","This is one of the better books of the TOS series. It has a definite tension, mixed with suspense. And it also features a extraordinary landing party, in which Spock and McKoy are the senior officers, while Kirk remains on board the Enterprise, dealing with his own set of trouble. The interaction between the three of them is engaging as ever.The landing party boards a deserted gigantic Romulan space station, that is adrift in Federation space. Well, deserted... There are thousands of Romulans on board, but they appear to be in a definite state of decay. What happened to them? And is that happening to the landing party as well? How come that even Kirk and the Enterprise seems affected?A good read."
3,Not her best work,"Other reviews on this book are very thorough. It was a good story but it got a little bogged down with info. Solomon's best bet is ""blind curve"". It is excellent.."
3,Brace yourself and the toy!,"We were excited to get this toy because my son is really into all the droids and it comes with lots of them however it took 2 days to put this toy together because it kept falling apart. We had to rebuild the Sandcrawler twice because the bottom kept coming completely apart! My husband had to brace the whole bottom part with extra piece plates that we had from other sets. This is definitely not a ""put together Christmas day"" toy and if you don't have the time to put together all at once or a place to put pieces away from other children, you may want to skip this one until another time. Now that it is put together (for the time being), my son has been gently playing with it and he loves it."
2,Too Fragile for play,"It looks amazing and would be a fabulous toy IF it did not take an entire day (or more) to build and IF it could be picked up, let alone moved, without falling apart. All lego sets of this type are somewhat fragile, but this one cannot even support its own weight without generous extra bracing (I hope you have a large bucket of extra plates handy). This is an adult display model, not a toy. It will tax the patience of any adult, let alone a kid, to build. It is definately not for any kid of any age that would actually try and play with it.If you intend to buy this expensive kit for your child be aware that you will absolutely have to permanently glue at least the base plates and track assembly mounts at the very beginning of assembly or the whole thing will collapse the first time he/she pushes it over the table. Ours was also missing approximately 10 critical pieces (again, keep that big tub handy)."
4,Calculator case very handy,Holds calculator very well and clips on belt nicely and does not come off even though is not a loop. Have had case for a month very happy with it
2,Too Bad the Book Wasn't as Good as the Title.,"The story reads like a Sci-Fi Channel original movie. Take that how you will.Personally, I was looking for a light-hearted read when I picked this book up - which it certainly delivered upon. My only issue is that the author didn't trust his readers to remember earlier, major details and would often overexplain/simplify what was going on.I, for one, like the title...in and of itself. However, it has little to do with the overall story and I'm sure it's misled legions of people expecting...something...different.Overall, I found it to be an enjoyable read, but I'm not sure I'll be buying any of Mario's other books.Recommended for fans of Sci-Fi's Saturday afternoon programming who are looking for a predictable vampire story that intertwines a few different genres to create some mildly interesting twists and turns along the way."
2,I tried to like it but I can't,I'm usually a big fan of vamp books with a good twist of humor but I can't quite get into this series. Just too superficial and I'm not getting too attached to the main character. I really wanted to like it particularly since I enjoyed Jeanne Stein's vamp series and she's plugged his books on websites and such but they don't really work for me.
3,"Nymphos - Good Start, Dissapointing Ending","When I saw The Nymphos of Rocky Flats at the book store, I bought it because it sounded like a fun, different take on the typical vampire story. Most of the story was really good, up until the end, which just seemed too abrupt and weird. I won't say why, for people who want to read this book, I just have to say I'm kind of dissapointed in the ending."
2,"Nice idea, not much else","The story is OK. The plot is OK. I expected something more sexual and more fun. The vampire detective has been done before, and better. It was a quick read, which was good.I expected more sex from a book that deals with vampires and nymphos. I expected more humor.Oh well."
2,Almost satisfying,"I loved the premise of a modern day vampire private eye. The set up in chapter one was very good, but ultimately the book fails to live up to its potential. It was neither dark enough, nor sexy enough, nor funny enough to make for a truly satisfying read. Acevedo tried to deliver on so many facets of the plot that he failed to do justice to any of them. Knowing that this was the setup for a series he could have delivered a solid ""origins"" story and followed up with the other elements in the second book. I was hoping for something in the vein of the Sonja Blue series from Nancy Collins, but got more of a ""Carl Hiassen does vampires"" experience where there's lust, blood and bullets but it is all rather light-hearted. It was a quick read."
1,Dissapointing,"Overall I thought the book was poorly written. The writing was crude, the characters were static and lacking in personality, and the plot was dissapointing, predictable, and unoriginal. I never felt any attachment to the characters or engagement to the plot. I realize that this is a ""fun read"" not classic literature, but the author came no where close to writing an engaging fun read like Janet Evanovich, Jaqueline Carey, or Nora Roberts can."
1,Buy used if you must,"I'm from Boulder originally and thought it would be great to read a local author about a local area.The book is amateurish and derivative. Acevedo writes like a beginner. There is no character development and the whole plot becomes increasingly a mcguffin. (Screenwriting term for a quest or object that doesn't really matter, it's just the starting point for a romp.)I thought all of the modern vampire lore was a bore. Done better in many other places. The hypnotising eyes are used too often. Plot-wise, it's convoluted and unstimulating.The Iraq war scenes at the top were the most interesting. Somebody must have told Acevedo war stories would be a bore so spice it up. Put vampires in it, yeah! And write a sexy title, wooh!I won't buy his next book, but I'm inspired to publish a novel now. Look at the competition."
4,great fun! with a bit of gruesome!,"I was advised to read this author by a friend and I have to say I read it all in one day and loved it!! Such a giggle!Yes some things did get on my pip, the constant use of certain phrases and words; but the rest was excellent, horror/comedy/thriller/espionage!ex army turns vampire turns PI.... then the fun starts.A whole new view of vampires and their world, shades of Buffy humour! with fairies, sprites and ET!If you were to take out the supernatural element you would have a fairy good thriller to boot.Will definitely be looking up more, for lighter moments of good reading."
4,Worth it for travel,"We have a full size swing that our baby loves, but we purchased this swing to take on trips with us. Our baby is 4 months old and we've taken it on two trips and it has been great. It's not nearly as good as a full size swing, but it's perfect for occasional use for trips or visiting. It's not as powerful or as sturdy as a regular swing, but it does work well."
4,nice swing!!!!,"My five month old daughter enjoys this swing. I like it because it has no music or lights, so my child has a chance to spend some quiet time. Would recommend it for parents who have babies that become over stimulated easly or for parents who do not want their child to hear music."
2,I took mine back!!!,"I bought this swing for trips to Grandma's house. I have 2 full sz. Graco swings- home & sitter's house. I was immediately disappointed in this one. My son is 5 mos. & 15 lbs. Box states it will work for baby up to 25 lbs. Even on high speed,it would barely move 2 inches in either direction. The seat is stuck in a reclining position so baby can't sit up. The size is convenient for travel and it looks nice, but performance is lacking. I purchased the Graco HideAway swing when I returned this one. It is a bit larger than this one but not quite a full sz. Also has seat w/ more support and a mobile- for the same price. This might be a good swing for a smaller baby or newborn."
1,Waste of money,"I generally love FP products but this has been a waste of money.Baby has never liked it, seems very uncomfortable for him. Used it for the 1st time at 2 1/2-3 months and because of no solid back support it curls his head forward bringing his chin to his chest making it impossible for him to breath. He is just an average sized baby. Seems very unsafe for that reason, try breathing with your chin touching your chest."
3,Sluggish swing/poor speed selection,Though the fabric and convience of the swing is nice. It just does not swing fast enough for my son(even though it supposably has 5 sluggish speeds). I have tried to put him in it many different times (even when he's sleepy) and he cries and wants out. He perfers the other faster swing I have. If I would'nt have thrown out the box.I would have taken it back.
1,"Green tea made in Clifton, NJ","I enjoy a good cup of green tea, however this has to be one of the worst green teas I have tried. I had to throw it away twice.Maybe the North American manufacturer isn't as good?"
2,"Annoying, ""Minty"" Taste","As I continued to drink this tea, I became annoyed by a distinct ""minty"" taste it has. One of the bags tasted so minty I thought they slipped a bag of their 'Green Tea -- Mint' into the box. It really is that noticeable and is not a quality I look for in an everyday green tea.I won't be buying this again. Only a few bags are in the box now, and I'm struggling to finish them.I'm going to go back toEDEN ORGANIC SENCHA (GREEN TEA) 16 BAGS, which I've found to be the best bagged green tea for the price. Tazo Tea makes a good bagged China green tea --Tazo China Green Tips Green Tea, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)-- but it costs much more per box than the Eden brand where I shop."
2,LOOSE PACKAGING,"Very good quality green tea, and good for the health. But 2 boxes out of 4 boxes (I still have upopened 2 boxes) had loosened packaging in each tea pack, and the teas inside came out of pack. I cannot drink tea powders. Customer service never returned my left message."
5,Great Green Tea,"I love green tea, some, that is. Not all green teas have the clarity and subtle flavor of Twinings. My first action each morning is to have a large mug of green tea with dried cranberries in the bottom of the mug and often I repeat this in the evening. Obviously, I don't want to run out."
4,Twinings Greean Tea 50 Count Teabags,These tea bags are very mild - you could even call them weak. For a fuller flavor I use 2 bags per cup.They are very pleasant and very well priced (although the price has been fluctuating lately.)
5,Up to Expectations,"I agree with other reviews that say the book ended rather abruptly, but luckily you aren't left hanging for long. Simply purchase the next book of the series with this one and you can pick up where The Duchess in Love left off. I have read many regencies and this one had an original plotline (to me). There were no hard feelings between the Gina and Cam, in fact they have stayed friends over the seperated years. Eloisa James made sure that I did not like Sebastian, which helps Gina and Cam come together without mixed feelings on my part. But this makes the following books a little harder to read. Overall the story, characters, and humor was wonderful and kept me entertained long into the night."
4,"Lusty, complex story",This is more complicated than the typical romance formula. It has a variety of interesting characters and romantic interests. Well done
2,It's really not good at all,"So very many characters and the only likable one is really the heroine. She has three close friends -- of which one is too stupid to live and the other is just generally boring. The hero is a man-child and he never grows up, nor does he ever really take responsibility for his own matters. A ton of errors, too. Everytime I read ""Marquess Bonnington"" it pulled me right out of the story, which I admit wasn't really captivating to begin with. The whole thing with the illegitimate brother could have been left right out for all the good it did. In fact, a whole lot of it could have been cut out to tighten the storyline. Poorly crafted with not much to recommend it."
3,It has its moments...and when it does- they're brilliant!,"I gave this book 3 stars for one reason- to characters who are secondary character rather than the primary ones-Camdon and Gina. When reading this book I thought it rather boring and dull but I fell head over heels in love with the a secondary story line with that characters Carola and Tuppy( Lord and Lady Perwinkle). I have to admit once I got into their story I ended up skipping through the book just to get to the few parts of their story. If the entire story had just been about their relationship from start to finish it would have gotten a 5 star rating. I finished the book wanting to know those characters story and their ending. If you read this book and dont like it, atleast skim through and find Carola and Tuppinghams story. You will definitly enjoy it. Gina's other friend Lady Rawling's character was depressing and annoying. I really wish th eauthor would rewrite the story of Carola and Tuppy. It would definitly be a book I would buy!"
3,"Okay, But Parts Drag...","There were times when I almost abandoned this book, because it got so dull. I don't understand the rapturous reviews of it - the sequel, Fool for Love, is a much better book."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK!,"I read a lot of romances, and I'm kind of sick of all the misunderstandings in the plots. Why don't these people just talk to each other? Eloisa James's new book was absolutely marvelous that way -- NO misunderstandings, just laugh aloud funny lines. A great sexy romance"
3,My first Eloisa James book...,but it won't be my last. I really enjoyed this author's writing style and humor. I liked the characters but found myself more interested in the secondary characters than the main two. I look forward to trying more by this wonderful author.
2,19th Century Edition of a Swinger Party??,"This was just a little too much for me....too many characters and too much sharing with barely a care. The many characters diluted the story. It could have been much better had this been a couple of books. The ending was so convoluted as well. There were so many characters to follow....and do you really hardly care if your best friend sleeps with your fiance, even if you are with someone else? No best friend does that. Or encourage your friend to coax your husband to his bed for you?? It was just weird. Also, you really don't get to feel the development of the characters and their emotions when you are following so many at once. The writing wasn't bad, the story was. Normally I think Eloisa James' books are much better than the reviews on here, but not so with this one. I believe I remember reading at least one other in this series and really liking it, so I don't think this was necessary to set the basis for the others."
5,Incredible- A Cut Above Other Historical Romances,"Duchess In Love is an incredible romance novel that contains well developed main and supporting characters, extremely sexy dialogue, a witty plotline, and steamy romance scenes that never get boring. This is the first novel I have read by Eloisa James, but I intend on reading more by her. She has also written Potent Pleasures, Midnight Pleasures, Enchanting Pleasures, and Fool For Love (a sequel to Duchess In Love which will be in stores in August of 2003). This is truly one of the best historical romance novels I have ever read, and I put Eloisa James in the same class as famed romance novelists Johanna Lindsey and Judith McNaught.-Kate"
2,Skip this one,"This is one of the weakest romance novels I have read in years. I liked E. James first few novels and had looked forward to this one, but is was not worth the wait.The characters are dull and there are so many side plots you forget which characters you are reading about. There are three females with ""love problems"" and a fourth that shows up for briefly with no purpose at all. Skip this one."
3,Enjoyable,"The plot line sees our heroine wanting to get rid of her first husband in order to marry someone else. Her first husband has been out of the country for more than a decade but returns to grant her request.Of course, the two fall in love and put aside the differences that split them up in the beginning.It isn't the greatest, or most original, plot, but still well written. This, fortunately, saves it from being a horrible read and even manages to make it interesting."
3,Still entertaining...,"Hey, its not that bad... at least we do see the monster in details and not just quick edits...there is a story and the landscape is real and not just a blue screen.The only thing that bugged me about this movie is the ringing ofthe cell phones....argh just too many...But i do recommend this movie for anyone who like monster movies"
3,GAR GOILS AND BAT BOIZ,"Michael Pare is one of those B movie actors who keep getting roles in direct to DVD movies like this one. He joins guys like Casper van Dien, Michael Dudikoff, etc. in providing little acting credibility. Fortunately, the special effects are above average for a movie of this ilk, so GARGOYLE becomes an entertaining horror flick. Unlike many films of this nature, we even see the gargoyle in daylight, a brave move in this genre. The gargoyle is pretty impressive, though and there's significant bloodletting to please hardcore fans. Martial arts hero Tim Abell turns up as Lex the Slayer, who goes bonkers after a midnight gargoyle attack, and his performance is appropriately campy. Surprisingly good if you don't have too high expectations."
4,Gargoyle,I enjoy this movie. I like Michael Pare' and buy his movies. DVD is about a member of the church who is harboring eggs of a gargoyle and waiting for them to hatch and take over the religious community.
3,More CG Critters Running Amok,"I first thought this was a remake of that old TV movie from the 70s ""Gargoyles,"" but no such luck. (Hint Hollywood) Instead this is a cops movie searching for a murderer. SOme genuine suspense, but overall predictable. Ther critters are computer generated and look very much so. This might seem a little distracting at first, but still worth a view."

2,misleading ad,The text is just basic font - no layout - the cover looked like an advertisement - I didn't think it was the actual cover. Sorry - its presentation was just more basic than I expected.
4,Reading a Classic poem,The Song of Hiawatha is a timeless epic. I have read it several times and will do so again in the future
5,Hiawatha,An excellent read no matter how old you are. A good read aloud s it is long and can be picked up at any time.
1,Totally and Utterly ripped off,"This is a typewritten manuscript ..photocopied and bound ....rubbish ,undeniably the work of Longfellow but what have I paid for ?....nothing which I could not have downloaded myself ... I want to return this and be reimbursed every cost concerned ."
5,Very nice!,I purchased these for Christmas. I searched and searched and finally I found these beautiful cuff links. They are my husband's favorite cuff links. They are really nice.
4,Great System But Not Perfect,"Just received this set and my wife and I love it! The construction is very solid but not too bulky for us. The micro-fabric seems to be in high quality and goes along nicely with our furniture. The only two complains are: 1) The handle's height is not adjustable, which seems a bit too high to us (I am 5'6"" BTW); and 2) it would be great to have a hand-break (i.e. wheel lock button on the handle) -- We previously thought the red button on the handle is a wheel lock but it is not; it is the collapse/expand button instead. Despite these imperfection, we feel it much worth the $195 we paid for!"
2,Didn't Work for Me,"Patricia McDonald's The Girl Next Door was superb. Unfortunately this book is nowhere near that. To begin with, as others have noted, Britt was downright annoying. The conclusion is a huge stretch, & implausible facts are introduced to justify it. While Agatha Christie could sometimes pull it off, & even then not always, it doesn't work for most stories. The obvious suspect couldn't be guilty, it is too easy to see that. And really, while the author is described as a writer of romantic mysteries, this is really a romance of the Harlequin/Mills & Boon type under the veneer of a mystery."
1,Terrible narration,"The narrator has a very irritating speech impediment. The visuals are great but his voice seriously detracts from an otherwise good presentation. Why National Geographic would permit this distracting situation to exist, is beyond me. We finally had to turn off the video after about 10 minutes. Unless you are very tolerant, you might find this presentation to be a listening challenge."
4,Secret Yellowstone,"A brief overall synopsis of the interweave of Yellowstone's ecosystems. More of a quick primer than an ""everything you ever wanted to know"" documentary. And it's really true that the park is huge! Much of the park is untouched wilderness and pretty difficult to access, even dangerous if you venture off the established trails. I appreciated the glimpse of what can't be seen from the road. Not as indepth as I would have hoped, but still very interesting and plenty of good visuals. A little bit extreme on the special effects though, not really needed... but still, having visited there this summer, the video showed me some stuff that I wasn't aware of. And it's actually pretty good overall. What would be really nice, would be a longer, Planet Earth style approach towards a Yellowstone documentary. There is so much of material to work with. Yellowstone really is an amazing place, go see it in person if you can!"
2,Not so Excited!,I bought this DVD as we were getting ready for our trip to Yellow Stone and we hoped to get some useful insights into the wonders of the Yellow Stone National park from the point of view of a tourist. However we were disappointed as we did not find much details on the geological wonders that exist in the park and where/ what to see & approach.
4,Worth the view,"I have extensive backpacking experience in Yellowstone, usually for weeks at a time. For a 46 minute documentary on the less known aspects, it's definitely worth the time to watch. Most people think of the wildlife and geysers without much thought about what makes the geography, the role of fire, or the role of water.If you are expecting an IMAX experience or typical photo shots of Old Faithful, you'll be disappointed. If you are expecting to see a great overview of the parks ecosystem and geology, this a terrific."
1,Not good enough,"Bad video quality: shows a 4x3 frame with 16x9 embedded inside, so picture quality is about half as good as now-standard anamorphic video.Subject matter is poorly done: brief mention of expected Yellowstone topics like wildlife, geology/volcanism, forest fires, and rivers/waterfalls, but the video doesn't cover any of it well enough to be worth watching. Each segment is the introduction to a separate show, but the meat of the show is missing.The production is deficient: I think that the Quality Control department at National Geographic society must have been laid off.A better choice would beAbove Yellowstoneor best of allYellowstone: Battle for Life."
4,A nice tribute to Yellowstone!,"While photography and videos can never truly encapsulate the experience of being at Yellowstone, I feel this documentary did a great job on representing the true nature and power of the park."
5,I'm planning my trip now! WOW !,"The cinematography was fantastic. It has all the elements of a great film. And, no gratuitous sex scenes ... not even animals ... thank you!Well done. Two thumbs WAY up on this one."
4,Pretty helpful!!,I found this a great book to start learning piano. My college class uses this book and It is definately a great help.
1,Don't Buy It,"Perhaps this book would be interesting for children in their early teens. the simplistic storyline, cardboard characters and tacked on ending certainly does not provide much meat for more discerning readers. Would have like to give it no stars at all, but that is not possible it seems."
1,Very disappointed,"I had read other reviews on this item, so I ordered some. I was very disappointed in the construction using simple floral tape to wrap them up. The tape was very tacky and I can't imagine using these outside. They actually were a mess when they got here, similar to strings of Christmas lights getting tangled up. I think the price for them was way more than it should have been. I did like to total 'look' when turned on but I just couldn't deal with the construction."
1,Surely this price cannot be correct,"The other colors (green, blue, red) of this light set are $19.99. You can even buy the white ones at other online retailers for $19.99."
2,Disappointing Video Quality...,"if you really want buy this item because you are a big fan of Journey like me, wait for price to drop, hopefully below $15.00. I felt like an idiot paying the full price on this item. Due to the poor (below average) video quality of this DVD with just ok sound quality, even in 5.1 surround sound it is just average, this DVD is just not worth paying the full price for. Purchase the JOURNEY - Live in Houston 1981 DVD instead, this DVD comes with a live concert CD for lesser price. The sound & video quality are much better than the Japan version."
3,A Smidge Disappointing,"I am one of the biggest Journey fans I know under the age of 25. I own multiple viynls, all 14 studio albums, as well as multiple other recordings. I bought this DVD to extend my collection. I purchased it for $9 including shipping. I am very disappointed with the video and audio quality on the DVD. I would give them both a maximum grade of C-. The video is a poor analog-to-digital job as well as the audio. Nonetheless, this concert from the Budokan in Tokyo is a great archival piece for anyone who loves Journey in their prime (1981). That being said I would suggest to people who want a better quality Journey DVD to purchase ""Live in Houston."" If the price is good for this item and you are a hardcore Journeyhead, go ahead and buy this."
2,Just Cause they made it,"The game is fun but a bit buggy. Very large sand box to play in but very simple AI and limited in what you accomplish. Still, all in all, good fun."
5,Elegantly Effective,"I don't read too many books by leadership or management consultants, because they usually offer pat, superficial advice. What I loved about Elegant Leadership is that it let me come up with my own answers about how to improve performance and lead more effectively, based solely on my experiences and corporate culture.Mr. Neitlich does a great job providing frameworks to help the reader think about leadership issues, and then he asks structured, powerful questions so that we can think more deeply about how we lead. Also, unlike many other books, he provides a balanced, holistic view of leadership -- incorporating behavior, attitudes, conversations, and ways of thinking. I will refer to this book often, and give it to colleagues, managers, and direct reports. It has the ability to positively effect the way best business practices are conducted."
5,A Must Buy!!!!!!!!!!,"I fisrt purchased this CD about two years ago in Conner Pass in the Dingle Peninsula of Ireland. The music is absolutely beautiful. It has such an innocent quality that you can not help but fall in love with it. Completely instrumental, it soothes your heart just by hearing the first notes. If you buy the CD, share it and sends its beauty everywhere. I beleive that the best songs would be #1, Scarborough Fair because of its ability to tell a story through music and #5, Sheep Under the Snow for its harmony and wonderful music. Both are beautifully done and have such smooth rhthym. Some songs are traditional and others original but all will claim your loyalty. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have."
4,peaceful,"I wanted something very soothing, that works well as background music for sleep, meditation etc. I also wanted some ideas for my own beginning efforts at playing the celtic harp. This CD fulfilled both."
5,Favorite Book of All Time!,"I am an avid reader and have fallen in love with a lot of books and authors but this book is the cream of the crop Honestly it is the best book I have ever read, I completed it in 2 days, I just could not put it down. Napoli's style of writing just reaches out and pulls you right into her stories. I also read ""Zel"" which was right up there with ""Spinners"". I am now in the process of reading all of Napoli's books. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"
4,A pretty but sad story -- a must read!,"Spinners is a terrific retelling of the story of Rumpelstiltskin! (It has a great cover, too.) Spinners adds onto the original fairy tale a bit, showing you the perspective of the title character, who starts out as a talented tailor, who's poor but at the height of his life. He goes through a lot and you really have sympathize him. This book didn't end the way I hoped, and I'm trying not to spoil the book for you - but I must say, this book's ending was VERY tragic and . . . well, disappointing! I mean, the tailor never got what he deserved! However, this book provokes emotion as it was probably meant to and it does a great job, too. I highly recommend this book to others (at least above the age of 12)!"
2,TERRIBBLE ending!!!,"I thought this book was pretty neat when I started it, and liked it until I got to the end. I didn't like the end because I was on Rumpelstiltskin's side. I know that in the original story Rumpelstilskin didn't get the baby, but it doesn't seem right to make people feel how he felt, and understand why he did what he did and then just let Saskia have the baby.It makes sense, but I hated it.In my mind, the unknown spinner was a 'good guy', but Saskia was also a 'good guy'.I wouldn't recomend reading this book. The idea was great, but the ending was TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! A better retelling of a fairy tale is Beauty, by Robin McKinley.It is MUCH better than Spinners!!"
2,"well written, but not a good story","This book was very well written in the way that it is constantly in present tense. It is pretty cool reading a book in that form (you don't find that very often) but that enjoyment was overshadowed by the ending. I for one enjoy happy endings and i did not feel that this one as reolved. You really pity the Rumplstilskin character, but he is never really happy. I would not recommend reading this book if your standards require a happy ending, as mine do."
1,For lack of a better word: blah,"I have to admit, I was sorely disappointed in Napoli's work this time. The author does an amazing job of getting you attached to the protagonist, but leaves the reader with a startled ""WHAT?! That's it?"" at the end. This book left me with a dread of picking up another of her works for fear she would kill my faith in her writing once again. I must honestly say: If you want to keep reading novels by Donna Jo Napoli, read just about any other except this one."
4,"Disturbing, haunting, beautiful","This is my my first Napoli book and I'm definitely going to read more. It's a beautiful, haunting work and the spinner and Saskia are unforgettable. However, I too... was shocked by the ending. Although we see throughout the book that the spinner changes dramatically because people reject him and treat him as worthless and even though we all know the traditional end to the fairy tale, I still was expecting some sort of redemption for the spinner...I found [the book]...extremely creepy throughout and not because of how the spinner looks. The horror of what actually happens to him at the beginning is really disturbing and then the deterioration of his mind and spirit are very unsettling. Thankfully, Saskia's story counterbalances it nicely so it's not all depressing.Apart from the ending, I was very much impressed with the book and the author's ability to expand on a simple tale and flesh it out to the point we'll never look at Rumpelstiltskin the same way again."
3,i like it-except the end,"this book was so beautiful and i loved it, until the last page. the ending is so bad it makes me mad! it makes nooooo sence compared to her other books. usually her endings are wonderful, beautiful and have a reason for being what they are, but this one totally ruins the book. i think you should read it, though, and help me tell the author yo change the ending! Donna Jo Napoli, if your listening, change the ending or at least tell us confused readers why!"
2,not so hot,"I'm crazy about retold fairy tales but this one just falls a little short. For one thing, no real love story. For another, it was sorta depressing. I don't really like the tale of Rumpelstiltskin very much anyway (I always felt a little bit sorry for him (a very little bit)) but it has always held some sort of magic for me just like all the other fairy tales. This version of it just sucked the magic right out. It's not exactly dark but it's not light either. It just falls somewhere in the middle, like it was hanging in Limbo or something. I don't recommend reading it."
2,Depressing,"When I picked up Spinners, I wanted another fairy tale story. There is nothing of the fairy tale in this book. There was no romance, no happy ending, no magic, only broken lives through the whole thing. I kept thinking, well, it must get better some time, but it never did. Spinners was totally depressing."
2,Really disappointed.,"I love Donna Jo Napoli's books. I devoured Zel, Beast, Hush, and Sirena. Most of her stories are heartbreakingly beautiful, so I expected Spinners to evoke the same kind of sympathy for its characters that I felt for those in her other novels. I did feel so about Rumpelstiltskin, but towards the end of the book, he stopped being such a sympathetic character. Perhaps the authors wanted us to feel confused about Rumpelstiltskin, but I really did not want to feel so. Like her other books, the descriptions in this book are lovely. But while in her other works the endings are often tinged with sadness, Spinners ended violently and abruptly, with no resolution at all, and no catharsis. I am sad that a novel that began so well ended so strangely. This is one novel I will return to the library and not purchase for my home library."
4,"Good, leaves you wanting a different ending.","I saw this book at the bookstore, and put down the book i was previously going to buy in exchange for this one. As i started reading it I found that i couldnt put it down. I read it in like less than a week, but upon coming to the last chapter, found the ending somewhat disapointing. It leaves you wanting something else, perhaps more, or something different alltogether. It leaves you hanging, i personally would like to find out what happened to the spinner, but even if i did, the story would still lack something. I still give this book a VERY good rating, i loved it altogeter. I would recomend it, but would like to warn you that the ending leaves something to be desired....So, if you are looking for a good book, with mystery, magic, romance, and sadness, read SPINNERS, a great read, and a magical story in the full."
5,Perfect for new moms,"When my son was first born, the hospital advised us to record all of the diaper changes and feedings (the best advice since I could barely remember if I had brushed my teeth!) At first I tried to make do with a pad and pen but it was just so uninspiring. Then, I recieved this as a gift and was so grateful to have a pretty place to record all of his daily activities. I really enjoyed seeing something pretty for those few moments and the inspirational quotes are really interesting. I just wish it was easier to find! I think this is no longer in print and it's such a shame! My mom was a little surprised that I would use such a beautiful journal for recording pee and poop but honestly, what else do you have time for with a newborn?"
3,Goetia in simplified form,"I found this to be a quick, interesting read. The author's experience in Goetic workings was worth the price of the book. However, if you're interested in the traditional Goetia working get the Mathers translation. This is kind of a modernized, simple version which may affect the belief in the working (and thus the results.) Your mileage may vary.I'm still not sure why it's called ""Sexual Evocation."" Because there was only a very short section of the book that gave no working approach to this, mostly just fluff."
4,The 70th Spirit Seere is willing to do anything for the Magician.,"At your wits end? Need a change real bad? Try summoning Seere. ""He is of an indifferent good nature (and)... is willing to do anything for the exorcist."" Take his picture and speak to it. Ask him to bring you whatever it is you need since that is his function. Tell him to bring you some money or anything else tangible that you could use. Then be prepared to thank him appropriately as the authors recommend.""Really you shouldn't have. But I'm so glad you'd mention me."" -- Seere"
3,This book is good but to me it could be better,"I am disappointed with this book, because I believe it could be a lot better. But it still is okay. The only thing I liked about this book is the illustrations. I believe that if you bought The Goetia translated by Mathers, you would have a better buy. Also beginners should forego any Goetia books until they are experienced and buy ""Ceremonial Magic and The Power of Evocation"" by Dr. Joseph C. Lisiewski."
2,Calling this illustrated is a stretch,"This book isn't as salacious as the title might otherwise indicate. It's basically a reissue of Crowley's 72 spirit correspondences plus a couple additional chapters.If you know what the Goetia is, this might be worth a look to you. If you don't know the difference between a goetia, a goitre or gomorrah, this book won't be the least bit interesting.The cover image is a good choice - thank goodness New Falcon Publications didn't make this look like a Black Sabbath album cover.Artist David Wilson's work is sub-standard and really lessens the overall quality of the publication. Chapter 4, however, recounting an evocation gone wrong of Orabas is absolutely hysterical and reads like a cross between Dr. Faustus and a Peter Sellers movie."
5,A new vision of Goetic magick,"I'm delighted to see other magicians share Crowley's rational, non-traditionalist viewpoint about magick. It is refreshing to encounter a realistic and useful appraisal of Goetic magick that cuts through all the superstition that has come to surround this system of evocation. Lon has taken an obscure and frequently misunderstood body of lore and made it accessible for the modern practitioner. Modern science is, in fact, compatible with the ancient practices and so occultism has real world value. Further, David Wilson's images of the Goetic spirits gives this system a life and reality that I've never encountered in twenty years of occult study. All in all, this book is a must for anyone who aspired to practice this style of evocation."
2,Disappointing,"It's not actually written by Crowley and is not at all what I expected. It has some pictures of demons and angels and a few short invocations, but not much substance."
1,crap,"crap. the book is very badly made.binding is very bad, not good like the old version.still looking for the old version."
5,Magick With a Lot Less Fear and Confusion,"Once again Christopher Hyatt, along with the most able assistance of Lon Milo Duquette and the illustrations of David P. Wilson, has used his magic pen to make magick more accessible and less fearful, which is what needs to be done, in my opinion. In many instances they confirmed what I already believed about ceremonial magick, that it shouldn't be so complicated that few if any can perform it. If you want to try magical evocation, you definitely should have this book. Crowley wrote a book called Magick Without Tears. This is the new Magick Without Tears."
3,It fit my need.,I was looking for some Victorian Christmas music for a play. I found a piece I really liked on the CD and so I was very pleased.
5,"A Victorian Noel: European Carols for Dulcimer, Harp, Piano and Strings","I am a Christmas music lover, and have gathered a good many CD's over the years. This one that I just got is now my favorite. Some of the songs are familiar, and a few are new for me to learn. The arrangements are just PEACEFULLY SPECTACULAR. Each exquisite piece is a delight to hear; the instruments take turns running up, down, and around the melody and each other. Splendid harmonies, dynamics, and phrasing. I wish I could write music like this."
5,Just like Fram.,"I have always used Fram and know from experiance they stand behind the product. It was packaged well, arrived quickly and priced nicely. Would recommend to a friend."
3,Good bargain bag,"Only used once so far, but the bag is very roomy for a mummy bag. I'm 5'10"", 250 lb, and had no problem moving around in the bag. Not used to a nylon interior, so I'm undecided whether or not I like that. I would also prefer a compression bag rather than a stuff sack, but the stuff sack is sufficient if you're not planning on trying to stuff it in a backpack."
1,Battle Girl,"Interesting idea but the dialog is in Japanese and I don't speak Japanese, the rental was a waste of money and time.I suggest Amazon verify what language a film is recorded in before they offer it.Pass on this one unless you grew up in Japan."
3,Rapid delivery.,"I used this cat food for a long time but one of my cats developed an allergy to ""chicken meal"" (whatever that is) and that's a principle ingredient in this food."
4,ONE OF THE BEST SINGERS TODAY !,"Denise Perrier is a powerful singer in the Etta Jones-Irene Reid tradition. She has a very warm, nice voice. This CD is excellent but uneven. The band is very good with Houston Person on tenor and the underrated Calvin Keys on guitar. My favorite songs are ""Salty Papa blues"" (with a great sax solo), ""September in the rain"", ""An occasional man"" and ""Don't go to strangers"". Denise Perrier has done another CD(East meets West)which is even better."
3,I like this album,"It's very a pleasant cd, and the more I listen to it the more I like it. My favorite cuts are Easy Street, An Occasional Man (not recorded very often), and Salty Papa Blues. It's good late-night easy-listening jazz without being at all bland."
2,Hard to clean,"The textured surface sounded like a good idea but wait until you try to clean it! When frying ground beef or browning anything all the brown bits get stuck in the little ""dimples"" and it's almost impossible to get them out unless you soak the thing for days and then scrub and scrub. Stick with the flat teflon coated surface on another electric skillet."
2,mediocre,I purchased this skillet 8 month ago and I'm now looking for another skillet. This Rival has hot spots so cooking is uneven. Cleanup is hampered by the clever bumpy bottom. The little bumps fill with food particles and a plastic scrub brush is required to remove food. Also the teflon coating is flaking off.
3,Interesting But Repetitive,"This is an interesting book about the life of a salvage tug on the stormy North Atlantic. It is told from a sailor's point of view which makes for good story telling but may not be as factually acurate as possible. Mowat admits as much.This is a book that you can stop reading after completing the first half. There are only so many variations on the story of a ship in trouble, bad weather sets in, and the more-than-sea worthy tug heroically comes to the rescue. The book initially holds your attention but becomes highly repetitive by the later chapters.One thing I did very much appreciate about the book was Mowat's unvarnished explanations of how salvage companies earn their money. It's not an entirely glamorous business and Mowat does a good job of pointing out how one's pecuniary interests leads to decision making. Obviously, salvage tugs don't operate out of the goodness of their heart."
5,Great Read,"Farley does it again, his writing is superb and he has given me many happy hours reading in the past, and this book is no exception. An exciting account of salvage work off the coast of some of our most dangerous waters. How in the world Farley manages to make salvage work exciting is beyond me but his tales are gripping"
5,MINDBOGGLING!,"Shamania is an absolute mindboggling masterpiece.It captures you right away with the first sound of Arthur Mountaniol's eerie didgeridoo-like vocals and takes you through to the end,leaving you wanting more.It's a weird,grotesque and mystical music work of a rock opera proportions,but there are great songs here too with the fine guitar work,beautiful vocals,harmony and elaborate arrangements.Some parts of this music are really outlandish and even mocking with a lot of wry humor.But generally it's a mixture of hard rock and World music with Celtic and Shamanic flavor.All in all,this album is outrageously unique in terms of its unlikeness with anything in particular.A Very Must Have CD!"
5,Awsome,"Love this little amp, it can get a little hot my first one did an blew out, so they sent me another one before sending mine bakc, put the second one in a box with 2 pc fans works excellent for months now, hits hard and can make it hit low."
2,Worked great...for a while...,"I have had this unit for 2 years and it is basically at it's minimum power output. For a long time it was fine, but then I didn't notice the kick so I turned it up, same thing...2 years later it's all the way up and barely putting out anything at all."
4,"Great Recipes, But Know Your Stuff","I love this cookbook - I've made over 15 dishes from it so far, and only one had issues - the Chicken B'Stilla. It's not so much the recipe, as it is the fact that not every step is spelled out for a novice - so I didn't know how to blend cold eggs into warm stock - and ended up with a very interesting texture! There are SO MANY recipes in here that some techniques are not mentioned, things you can find in the Joy of Cooking, or elsewhere - so cross referencing might be helpful for a real novice (like me).That said, I have never seen a cookbook with more diverse ethnic cuisine, more interesting dishes, or better descriptions of new flavors for an American palette. Favorites include - Spinach and Chickpea Soup, Peanut Soup, Garlic Bread Salad with Tomatoes, Batrik, Dal, and Torta di Melanzane. And I will definitely be trying Chicken B'Stilla again - now that I know more about eggs!"
3,failed recipes,"Ok, I really liked the idea of one book for many ethnic recipes. How many recipes in a cookbook have to fail before you give up on it? I've made 2 recipes so far from this book and they were both not so great. First I made a sherry chicken dish with onions that I had to force myself to eat rather than throw it out. Then I made a pork posole. The posole called for a tablespoon of cumin or ""to taste"". You can't exactly go by taste as you are adding it to raw meat. A tablespoon seemed like an awful lot so I put maybe half that. The dish was so heavy on cumin it was terrible. I don't want to give up on the cookbook, but I am definitely discouraged...........Wendy"
4,inspiring!,"Just what I needed to get me going again--in the kitchen, I mean. Bittman is always good and these international recipes are typical of his no-fuss approach. I especially like the keys to recipes that are ""30 minutes to prepare or less', etc.--found at bottom of pages."
4,Easy recipes -- complex results,"Mark Bittman is a magician. His recipes never fail. I'm a big fan of his unpretentious, practical style. I use this cookbook all the time and have given it as gifts as well. I would recommend it for advanced beginner home cooks who like a wide variety of foods and flavors."
4,A great book for ideas,"The Best Recipes in the World has given me a perspective on cooking that I did not previously have. Other cookbooks may have done similar things to other people, but this was it for me. We enjoy cuisines from throughout the world, and this serves as a diving board to get into making the food of various areas. I initially thought that the book needed more pictures, but I have come to find that the paragraph description of each dish that Mr. Bittman provides is more valuable that a glossy photograph. I cannot give the book 5 stars, as the recipes do not always turn out great. Some of the recipes have been excellent, but others don't seem to be missing something or have too much of something else.Good:Chicken Biryani, Rajma, Miso Soup, Mexican Rice, some of the Southeast Asian dishesNot as good:Chicken with Almond Garlic Sauce, Coconut Rice"
5,Great for adventuresome chefs of all skill levels,"This cookbook is a great choice for classics and new ideas alike. It's my first resource for any and all cooking ventures, and the pre-recipe descriptions provided by the author make it easy to tell whether a given recipe will fit my time frame, budget, tastes and cooking abilities. Bittman also provides alternative preparations for many of his dishes, which makes it easy to alter to one's tastes or to spice up an old favorite. The book is well organized and easy to navigate, is packed with information and easy to use. A wonderful cookbook overall!"
1,Disapointing,"This is a lousy peice of junk!!!! you cant move the arms or legs at all!!!! if I could I would rate it 0 out of 100,000,000!!!!!!!!!!! This is a waist of money!!!!! DO NOT BUY PRICE IS OUTRAGOUS!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not for adults,"Nothing on the information for the video on Amazon.com stated that it is intended for grades 7-12. I was looking for information for adults with addictions issues. This video is ""specially designed for teenage viewers""."
1,Severe Headache,One of my Boyz got this CD. We was tryin to bumb to this Cd. All we got was a SEVERE HEADACHE. Old boy screams way too much.
1,Is she madeline?,She is different from what she used to be.She is too much naughty!!She is just nasty girl.I am very disappointed.
3,Minority Report,"Over time, my family has changed its opinion a bit about this polenta. It is an extremely fine grind, too fine for our taste. Bob's Red Mill polenta can be ready in ten minutes and doesn't strike us as pasty. The flavor of De la Estancia is excellent though. I have begun to use it instead of fine cornmeal in baked goods. For example, Martha Stewart has a wonderful, simple recipe for a blackberry cornmeal cake."
4,Yummy Polenta,"This is the first polenta that I've actually tried, which is why I didn't feel justified giving it 5 stars, since I have nothing to compare it to. I love the fact that this product is organic, and is labeled gluten free (since my boyfriend has celiac's disease--I wish more products were labeled this way). The polenta is creamy and tasty. I'd recommend cooking it much longer than the directions suggest, as the added cooking time allows the flavors to develop."
5,Polenta,This polenta is excellent. As I am northern Italian and eat a lot of polenta I will not purchase polenta made in the US because of 90% of corn products being genetically modified. I certainly recommend this product to anyone.
3,the book is ok,"this book is good to give you an overview about cougars. Yet, it is already quite old and if you want to read a complete and more recent book about cougars, i can higly recommend ""Cougar"" by Maurice Hornocker and Sharon Negri."
5,"Pass the SALT, Please!","Adam Roberts, with SALT is a great read. Roberts assumes the reader has an IQ above average room temperature; is over 17 years old; and can pay attention to details. Salt is a could-not-put-down book. In brief, a string of deep space habitats and colonists, literally hitching a ride behind a comet, set off to a distant planet, one that according to data was much like Earth. Misunderstandings develop during the long journey, planting seeds of mistrust among the ideologically differing colonial groups. Their destination is not Earth-like. It is covered with salt and contains an atmosphere of chlorine gas. It's impossible to return to Earth and the colonists have no choice but to deal with the alien atmosphere, and ultimately, with each other. I think Roberts' story could have gone on for a few more thousand words and hope that his next book will pick up the saga."
4,Great fix for staircase with spindles,"We are using this gate at the bottom of our steps to keep my 14 month old from going upstairs. But the end of the wall on one side did not end at the same place our bottom post on the railing stopped. And my husband did not want to put holes in our oak railing. So he mounted one side on the wall and we slide the gate shut between 2 of the spindles and lock it into place. So we can still open and close it easily, but she cannot. Our 4 year old can also open and close it easily to get upstairs."
4,A Some what perfect gate,"I purshased this gate after having broke the $60 gates that we had before. We use ours as the mounted gates and Love them they will act up a couple times and we have to adjust them again but it is worth it.As a mother of 22 month olf TWINS, I would highly recommend this if your child is starting to climb, our girls would climb our old gates and have fell over them a few times, we have not had that problem at all with the ""perfect fit gates"""
3,Not working great so far...,"I just bought this gate today for using at the bottom of my stairs. I bought this particular gate because it says that it works well on uneven walls. The only problem with that is that only one of your two walls can be uneven. I have baseboards running along both sides of the stairway, and the only way the gate will work is if we lift it like 3 inches above the floor to clear the baseboards. There is only a ""perfect fit"" adjuster on one side of this gate. My husband and I are going to try pressure mounting it tomorrow so we don't have step over it or remove it everytime we need to walk up or down the stairs. I'm hoping that will solve my problems. If it does then I will have to change my rating to 4 1/2 or 5 stars."
1,Not Perfect for Molding,"I purchased the Perfect Fit Gate after reading the packaging that says it will fit in doorways with molding. What it doesn't say is that the molding can only be on ONE side of the doorway.I considered installing the hardware to attach it, but I couldn't confirm that would work either and didn't want to put unnecessary holes in the wall just to try.So, we're still looking for a gate that is the perfect fit for us."
2,Not a perfect fit!,"This seemed like such a nice gate when I bought it-- I loved the fact that it didn't have a lattice or holes for my son to use as grips to climb up with, and I liked the way it looked in general-- but as soon as I got it installed I realized it was a mistake. I have the same problem others have mentioned here with the gate refusing to stay the same width after it has supposedly been locked. Every time I open and close it, the one of the sliding panels inches slightly outward, so that by the 3rd or 4th time it's been open and shut I have to readjust it again because it won't open at all, which is REALLY annoying. It might work well as a pressure-mounted gate, but as a swinging gate, it's next to worthless.Also, did anyone else notice that the screws they included were really cheap, and started to strip very easily?"
2,Misleading,"Be forewarned - the product is advertised on the outside of the box as able to fit 28"" doorways. That is only somewhat true. If you want this as a swinging gate, it only goes down to 30"". There is absolutely nothing on the outside of the product to suggest this. The item will be returned.Otherwise, it looks like a relatively solid product, if you're into 100% plastic construction"
2,better gates out there,I wanted to like this gate- I like the features but sadly it did not meet my hopes. first off- its way cheaper elsewhere. also the plastic is very cloudy- not see through at all which I expected it to be. I use it for the bottom of my stairs and I looked everywhere for a walk- through gate that did not have a bar that goes along the floor since I am very clumsy. I used it pressure mounted first and it pulled the paint off the wall from being too tight a fit or fell over being too loose a fit- it never seemed right. so we mounted it to the wall and that was a pain! I give 2 stars since when it is hardware mounted it does swing nicely and my kids cannot figure this gate out- they have been able to figure out the other gates opening mechanisms! I would only recommend this gate for specific circumstances.
3,works well for what it is,"Out of the 5 different gates I have tried, I like this one the best for pressure mount. I intended to use this only as a pressure mount, and so I haven't had all the problems other reviewers have posted. One of the other gates I bought was the plastic Safety 1st with the holes in it -- it was the only one available at BRU. By comparison, the solid plastic gate is SIGNiFICANTLY better. I feel this gate is pretty sturdy and has held up well with occasional use for 7 months."
4,Great Gate for our kitchen,"We use this gate for our Kitchen area to keep our boys out when cooking/cleaning/etc. This gate works perfect, as they do not have an easy way of climbing it. Yes, the gate does become loose after removing it and putting it back in it's place...HOWEVER, it's not THAT big of a deal, as I can adjust it with one hand and a leg if need be while holding my baby.This is our 3rd type of gate for our kitchen area and so far I like this one the best. Our company has had difficulty operating every gate that blocks our kitchen...but I think that's user error for it doesn't take much but a little patience and common sense to figure this gate out.This gate also works great if we are using it to block of a certain hallway area or living room as well.I would Highly recommend this gate for regular use...although I'm unsure of whether I would use it at the top of stairs, for we have not attempted that."
1,Didn't fit my doorway,"Unfortunately, despite the fact that it advertises that it will fit any doorway, I have high baseboards on each side of the opening and only one side of the gate adjusts to accomodate high baseboards. It was not sturdy at all, returned it."
2,Eh.,"So, we have had a similar experience that this gate is a big pain if you plan to open it. It also damaged the paint and plaster on our wall. The only saving grace is that we could use it to block off the bottom of the stairs OR the doorway between the kitchen and living area with it hardware mounted in one place b/c of the perfect fit feature. Our hinge also broke and they were going to charge to replace it, but after I complained they agreed to send it no charge, which I guess is better than buying a new gate."
1,I hate this gate!!!,"Ok, so I've had this gate for about a month and I thought it was great because it is very sturdy, and isn't very easy for a toddler to climb over. Well, I usually use it in front of my 2 year old's room door when it's his bedtime and at other times when I need to finish doing things around the house and don't want him to wander where I can't see him. Well, I put it in front of his door tonight and somehow he managed to stick his whole arm into the skinny opening (the handle part that you push down on to lock it). He was crying and it took me a while to get his arm free. I actually thought I was going to have to cut the handle part open! I am never going to use this gate again! I've never had any problems with the few other products I've purchased from them, so I didn't expect this type of thing to occur. I just want other parents out there to know that it CAN be dangerous for some children!!!!"
1,Gate is only a block,"This gate does not work as it should. I have purchased a few of them, thinking the first couple were defective, but they are all the same. I spent hours mounting this gate in front of my stairs so I could use it as a door. It will close by applying pressure to the sides like a normal gate, but it WILL NOT open. It will refuse to release the pressure unless you put it in adjust mode and manually pull it off the wall. This is not what was advertised on the box, or instructions. This gate is worth about 5 US dollars. Do not waste your money!"
1,"Terrible, terrible product.",This product has a nice design but it is made of such cheap plastic that the locking mechanism has no strength. When you push the locking mechanism down instead of locking it just strips out the plastic teeth that the door moves on.
1,Only worked for a week - wasted money!,"My experience is about the same as every other perso who rated this 1 star. We hardware mounted it to our door frame and it worked OK for about a week. We occassionally had to adjust it, but it seemed to be acceptable. But then after that first week, it stopped holding pressure and now it barely stays closed, even after adjusting it mulitple times.We will be buying a replacement for it. Money wasted!!!!"
1,Don't buy this gate,"We had this gate for a few months and it barely fits into a 30"" door frame (the door was removed long ago). The gate doesn't always open nicely and you end up fighting it all the time. I go over it most of the times but I'm also 6 ft tall. Now I added a bungy cord to it to help it slide back while opening, which it not always does. All in all a poor design. The integration of the locking and extending functions doesn't really work well."
1,Safety first?,"I do not recommend this gate if you have any safety concerns, such as using it at the top of stairs. The locking mechanism is seriously flawed, allowing the gate to pop open with the slightest touch--or even on its own. Three other flaws: 1. most of the crucial ""hardware"" is plastic and thus pliable, 2. the braces into which the gate locks are far too shallow, especially given the ""auto-unlocking"" mechanism, and 3. the ""autofit"" feature makes for a very loose fit, again, esp with the flawed locking mechanism. I suspect lawsuits will take this unit off the market. DO NOT BUY if you have safety concerns and definitely do not use on stairs."
1,what a waste of money,"I purchased this gate thinking in would be perfect for a high traffic area. I was totally wrong!!! Every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it, which makes in impossible to open and close with one hand. Forget it if you have to get through in a hurry, 'cause it needs to be readjust to open AND close it. Plus the gray bumper on mine is loose, so if I can get the top bracket to fit correctly, the bottom one is to lose and not secure. I have to get on my hands and knees to readjust it correctly so I can close it, only to go through the same readjusting hassle in a few minutes. I would have returned this gate, but I trashed the box before I installed it."
3,"Questionable ""ease of use""","I bought this gate because our former gate broke in less than 2 months.We have ours mounted with hardware, our 15 month old can tear down nearly anything that is not. So far it has been QUITE frustrating getting it to stay the proper size. You need to make sure NO ONE lets the gate get ""locked"" while its open, or your sure to have to readjust it. It also makes loud popping noises after it is locked. The handle isn't very easy to use either with it positioned in the center of the gate rather than the end. Our son has still been able to push it open on occasion, I would NOT trust this near stairs!"
1,Terrible as a walk through gate,"We just returned this gate after installing it at the top of our stairs. When used as a hard mounted gate instead of a barrier, the gate expands an extra inch to fit the doorway every time you close the handle. After a few uses the gate is 3 or more inches longer than when you set it to fit the doorway. This means that you have to resize the 2 panels every few times you close it. How annoying! It's like the company didn't test it well enough before releasing it. It's probably great as a pressure mounted barrier but it's horrible as a gate."
2,I really liked it at first...,"I really liked this gate at first. I worked well with our uneven walls and pass-throughs. It is annoying that the gate doesn't save its position and has to be readjusted every few uses. Do not use this at the top of stairs. We have it in our kitchen, and through normal use, the hinges have broken three times! We keep replacing them, but they only seem to last a shorter period of time. I have had the gate for 1 1/2 years. Beware using this gate for security not convenience- it may not hold up as well as a nice metal gate (which is what we have on our stairs and I love)."
4,works fine enough for me,"If you have already bought this gate and can't get it to work with your floor molding, just lift the gate with your foot and lock it in above it. So far my little billy goat hasn't been able to climb over this yet. I will disregard what Hollie from GA said about not using the gate on stairs because there IS special mounting hardware to use for this gate. The lady she complained about even specified that in her review. I gave this gate 4 stars because it takes the paint off the walls and I have to hold the button in and hit it against my leg or something to make it shorter."
1,One of the hinges broke!!,"I just bought this gate about 2 months ago, it was very nice fit perfect and yesterday one of the hinges broke!! I do not recommend this product to anyone for the top of the stairs, it is very dangerous!! Luckily we saw the broken hinge before our daughter leaned on it. I am very dissapointed, now I have to go and buy another gate, I will still use this one for the bottom of the stairs, since it doesnt require mounting."
1,I hate this gate,"I first attempted to use this gate as a pressure mounted gate. The doorway to my dining room where I planned to use it has base board moulding on both sides. There was no way to get this gate to fit using the pressure mount. I then attempted to use it with the hardware as a gate for the top of the stairs. As a hardware installed gate it is supposed to be safe to do this. But I was unable to get it to work. After drilling into the woodwork at the top of my stairs, and into the wall on the other side. I discovered that is was imposible to get the gate adjusted so that it would swing open with one hand. The adjustment that is supposed to make it fit into uneven doorways kept moving so that it would not clear the wall cups. I would get it to work once, but then it kept moving. I had to take it down, and I will be returning this to the store. I will also be patching and painting my wall and woodwork."
2,Very annoying to use,"I use this gate for two different doorways, each different sizes. It's so frustrating trying to adjust and secure it.It does work well when in place correctly, though."
1,terrible gate,"We bought this gate to install at the top of the stairs. We used screws, not pressure mount. Within a month, the plastic on the hinge cracked and broke and the whole gate was useless. Plus, it is hard to install and awkward to use. Every time you close it, you have to slide the door and reset the setting so it is securely closed. I guess we got what we paid for!!"
2,this brand sucks in general,"I used this product in tension position, not mounting. It only works sometimes. the handle tends to stick in locked position almost always until you use all of your muscle jerking your arm and sometimes to regain the lock position. Is it just mine? Mostly it holds weight well but when its not set properly forget it. Did I mention all the force required in order to properly set it?"
3,If not mounting and using in a hallway that it fits snugly:,I have a question- not a review. If you are not mounting and using these in a hallway where they will fit snugly- do you past users for this gate see this usage as problematic in any way or not good for it's proposed purpose.
1,Won't stay closed!!,"I HATE this gate. I don't often write online reveiws, but in this case I had to. We used the hardware to mount this gate and the stupid thing will not stay closed. It makes a big ""pop"" and then the gate spontaniously swings open. I have to go and adjust it, and five minutes later ""POP"" and it opens again. The mechanism that allows you to adjust the width is faulty and as pressure is applied (it is a pressure mounted gate afterall) the mechanism gives way, and there is no longer enough pressure to hold the gate closed and it swings open. I don't want my baby to fall down the stairs and die, so I'm unmounting the gate, patching my wall, and taking it back."
1,Horrible gates! Do not purchase,"I have bought a huge variations of baby gates and i got this one as the brand we normally bought was sold out at the store. The gate was difficult to set up, and it did not stay in its place. It kept popping out when we open it. Worst gate in the world and i would not even give it a star if i could. Waste of my time and money."
4,"Nice, once you get over the smell","This is a solid mat. I put my bowflex on it and it fits nice. And, it protects my wood floors. There is only one drawback.The room I put it in (a 12' x 10' spare bedroom), smells like a tire store. The rubber smell is overwhelming the first couple of days. I had to keep the windows open with the fan on to vent it out. Even after a few weeks, it still smells (although not nearly as bad).So, I guess if you can handle the smell initially, it'll do what you want."
3,Stinky,"This mat is heavyweight and good quality, but quite stinky. Stinky as in very strong rubber smell I dont know if this is good for health or if there is a way of avoiding making your home smell funky from the mat."
4,Jesus Christ Solid Rock,The book I received was in very good shape for as old as it was.It was also received in a timely manner. I would definitely order fromJim's Book Room again.
3,Made in China,"I bought a replacement for a Milwakee porta band saw.It looks about the same as my old one but this one is made in China.the gearing is not as smoothe as the old,makes more noise than the one made in the USA.It operates good and only time will tell how long it will last."
3,Try Before You Buy...,"I cut a lot of conduit at work and had used band saws belonging to others several times. Finally I decided to take the plunge and buy one of my own. I had never used a deep-cut model and will probably never cut anything larger than unistrut, so my selection was based on the variable-speed feature more than anything else. To cut to the chase, this saw is a bit awkward to use...Milwaukee located the motor dead in the line of sight of the blade and it's harder to get and keep the cut on a line than with the standard depth saw. It cuts very well and the variable speed control is great, but after using the standard depth model (which affords great visibility for making cuts) this one is somewhat of a letdown. Had I tried one in the field first I would not have bought one. In terms of quality, it's a Milwaukee...! I just wish the design were more user-friendly."
5,Great Saw,I just receive my 6232-6 today. It can with red plastic case. I was surprised to see the saw is Made-In-USA. It came with 5-year warranty. Amazon has the best deal. All other deals including e-bay charges shipping from $40-75 dollars. Amazon is free. I would recommend this saw to anyone who wants high-quality band saw.
5,Great saw,"This is the saw for cutting steel.So smooth and easily slices throughthick steel.Tried one at work and had to have one for home.Much faster andsmoother than my sawzall.These new Amazon prices are insane, I'm almosttempted to buy one more, but the one I bought will last foreever.This price won't last long.This saw is the best out there and at this priceI would buy it now even if I didn't need it now!!"
5,Best Amazon purchase I've ever made!,"My husband is an amateur blacksmith and needed a tool to reduce his time in cutting some of his metalwork. He had borrowed this exact item from a friend, and it cut his work time significantly (what had taken 60 minutes by hand took only 30 seconds with this tool). I went online to see if I could purchase one for him last Christmas, but wasn't sure I could afford it, as our friend had recently paid $500 for his. I was so pleasantly surprised to find the exact item (brand new) at Amazon for 1/2 the cost: $250. We have been more than pleased, and my husband was very happy last Christmas!"
2,The overexploitation of a franchise.,"~Civilization was excellent. I loved that game.~Civilization II was 10 times better, my favorite game of all time until 'Europa Universalis II' came out.~Civilization III.... it was long in development, building everyon's excitement.. only to find that the game had been stripped of substance and flexibility of Civ II to be replaced with some cheap memory intensive graphics. The Funny thing is that the stuff they stripped were really easy text-based encoding, like the number civilizations and their cities. I have to give this game a bad rating... it was obviously not a well thought out adventure, but instead an exscuse to use the ""Civ"" name and make a few bucks."
5,Easily the best game ever,"I can't believe the reviews I'm reading here. It has to be noted that a lot of the gripes that people have, such as corruption, AI-to-AI tech trading and difficulty, can be changed in the editor that ships with the game. It should also be noted that the in-box game version is 1.07f; there is a 10MB patch available, taking the version up to 1.29f, that also fixes a lot of issues. So buy this game and download the patch....So don't be put off by all the negative comments; a lot of these people clearly have no idea what they're talking about. It sounds like a lot of people have picked up the game, been frustrated because they coudn't win right away and come here to whine.This is a superb game, and the customisable aspects will keep you playing and modding for a very long time."
5,One of the best games I've ever played,"I am simply amazed at all the bad reviews this game has received on here. I have played all kinds of games, but prefer strategy. This is easily one of the best games I've ever played. The depth and the difficulty of the AI is remarkable, and quite challenging. Those who don't like to micromanage, don't have to. Those who do, enjoy!"
4,Good Game,"I've played this game off and on for a little over a year. The addictability of this game is just as good as the previous games and ther have been times I simply didn't go to bed, even though I worked the next day.I was a little disappointed that the ages stopped at the modern age. The futuristic cities, units, etc. in Call to Power is what really hooked me on that game. It also would've been nice for the Foreign Advisor screen to provide more information that just trade and treaties.Civ III does compensate, though, with great graphics, the new culture concept, specific civilization advantages as well as all kinds of other little improvements that make the game that much more realistic and enjoyable."
1,Very disappointing,"Civilization II and Alpha Centari are my favorite games bar none, other games come and go but these two remain on my hard drive. Civilization III will not be joining them. The company's focus seems to have been on making Civilization II look brand new and high tech but the result was that it made the game unplayable. The printing in text and on graphics is eye straining; I ended up trying a magnifying glass to help me read what was on the screen. This didn't help much when text was superimposed on existing text. The unit types look basically identical to each other and are difficult to differentiate (scout? worker? settler? Your guess is as good as mine) Asking what a particular unit is tends to make the system lock up though not as bad as trying to look at a city screen. I doubt that there was enough play testing done on this monster. My advice for anyone wishing to play Civilization III, get yourself a good book, you will have tons of free time."
1,"I Hate This Game, Nothing Works Here.........","I loved Alpha Centauri. I blew [money] on Civ3. This turkey crashes IMMEDIATELY upon performing the first move, every time. That's in spite of my 850 Mhz Pent 3 processor, SB Live 5.1 soundcard and GeForce 2MX video card. Not a driver issue, it's a bug-riddled, patch-addicted, no support..."
1,Don't Buy,This game was rushed to the public and needed about 3 more months of testing to work out all the bugs. You think if it is the third in the series it would have all the features of 1 and 2 but it doesn't. This game had so much potential to be the best ever but Fraxis ruined it. Just buy a copy of Civ 2 and wait for Civ 4.
3,"Decent overall, but can't shake that disappointing feeling","I am a huge fan of Civ and Civ II, and played both way too many hours. Civ II was an excellent upgrade from the first Civ.Civ III just seems to be way too tedious. Figuring out all of the commands is not as easy as in the past, though there is more variety. And have we all been forced into having civilizations with large numbers of cities or a large geographical extent? In Civ II you could have 6 - 10 cities, which, with the right trading partners and development, could take on most anyone. Without the trade caravans anymore, and with the requirement of various resources and luxuries, you are forced to either have a sprawling civilization, or perhaps be a diplomatic whiz so you can trade for what you lack.Automating the workers is great, there are some improvements, but it just doesn't have that wonderful CIV feeling of the first two."
3,Not a big improvement over Civ II,"I am somewhat disappointed in Civ III. Although there are some new features, I don't think it warranted a new release. Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but if you own Civ II, there is no real reason to buy this game.Additionally, I found a bug that causes the game to error out when trying to load a saved game. It happened a couple of times which ruined a great game of mine. (I lost about 30 hours of work). Oh well.If you are new to the Civ series, you should definetly get this game."
3,"Its ok, but Civ 2 is still better.","While the graphics and new units are great, the game play is not all that great. its certainly not better than Civ2. Probably the one thing that really bothered me more than anything else was the fact that a unit on horseback could defeat my TANK! Are you kidding me?! The game is so-so. It is definitely not 4 or 5 stars like these 12 yr olds say it is. Get Civ2, its cheaper and better."
4,Wow!,"Civilization III really blew this time!!! Amazing graphics, real leaders and very addictive. If you like Age of Empires or Empire Earth, you'll love this game. Way to go, Firaxis."
2,Could be fun if it did not crash so often,I really hate it when games do this. I played earlier version of Civilization years ago and it was more stable.
3,Civilization 2 v3,"This is quite literally Civilization 2 with modifications. They've revamped the interface on the game to make some parts slightly confusing and difficult to get used to and to stop it from looking exactly like Civ2.As in Civ2 the game grips you. I am currently hooked on it. It's that kind of game. Once you've completed however it's going to all of a sudden become uninteresting because overall there just isn't enough. Exactly what happened with Civ2.It's nice to play such a game again but I don't feel it's worth buying if you've got civ2. If you are a fan of Civ2 go and buy it, but I reckon you should hold on to your money and wait for something else if not.Think twice."
1,Worthless,"This game is a joke. There simply is no AI. The only thing that keeps you from winning is the ""AI"" deciding beforehand what will happen. enemy units appear from nowhere, city enhancements do not work. Buying this game amounts to throwing your money away."
1,A giant step backward!,This game is an order of magnitude more frustrating than Civ II.It is nearly impossible to win at the Chieftain level without replaying moves. And that is ridiculous.Civ II is the ultimate strategy game and subsequent versions just don't measure up.
1,this is to counter balance the people who gave it 5 stars,yes lots and lots of people gave this game 5 stars even though it hadn't even shipped. Most of the people who actually bought the game didn't like it so this should even out the overall score a little. Maybe not.
2,Not the best game on the block,"I'm a fan of all games, FPS, RTS, RPG, and Sims so by no means am I partial to any one gaming catigory, so when i saw Civ 3 I thought it looked original but i was sorely mistaken. After an exciting introduction my expectaitions were running high but I was soon to find out that this was but another AOE clone with a Alpha Cetauri engine. I gave it 2 stars because of the 2 redeeming qualitys:1:The music2:The Intro movie"
5,CAUTION - Can Be Highly Addicting,"Be sure before you start playing this game that you have someone around to stop you. I've frequently started playing for ""just a few minutes"" and lost whole hours four and five at a time playing this game. There's always just one more move to make. If strategy games are your thing this is a sure bet."
5,Great fun.,This game is great fun. I can and have spent many happy hours engaged in creating my own world. One of my favorite games of the moment.
4,Civilization at it's finest,"This is my favorite in the series of Civilization games. A huge improvement in graphics over the first and second game, this game also lacks the clunkyness I found to be detracting from the fourth game. The one downside of this game is that even when put into a sort of slow mode, you inevitably end up rushing through the games earlier units to try to get the best military in the world. The fix for this are the scenarios which lock in certain time periods and goals to help mix up gameplay a bit. With the addition of two expansion packs, new nations and special units become available, making this game a must have for those who wish to conquer the world!"
1,Civ 3 not as good as its forerunners,"Why did they have to do that? Why take out the strategic rules that make the game such a playable masterpiece? And the A.I. is sooo slow. Go and play Civilisation Alpha Centauri instead, its is at least 5 times better. For more civ reviews: http://www.otterit.co.nz/games/games.htm"
1,Loki,"Don't Bother...This game offers nothing new or interesting to the genre... It is Civ II in 3D, except with a few additional annoyances like ""strategic"" resources.Alpha Centauri is a far better game... Civilization:Call to Power is infinitely more fun.If you must play this game out of loyalty to the series I understand, but don't pay 49.95... Get it for half price over on eBay... I'll have my copy up on there in a few minutes..."
1,Does anyone know why this game crashes so much??????,"I've heard great things about this game so I purchased it. The installation went smoothly and started playing when the game froze 5 minutes into the game. I didn't think anything of it so I restarted the game and it froze again. After a few times, I uninstall and reinstall thinking this would help. It didn't. It kept freezing 5 minutes into the game.I've closed every applications as per Infogrames website and the game still freezes.I'm running on 1 GHZ w/ 512mb ram w/ 64mb video card and good sound card. This is more than enough resources to meet the system requirements.Does anyone know if there is a cure for this?Any help is appreciated."
3,no scenarios,the best part of civ 2 was the ww2 scenario and it is missing. You also can't start later in the civilization. The game is too long with a lot more boring parts.
3,Disappointing,"The game play is addictive like Civ 2, and the game AI is impressive but not better than Alpha Centauri. The game interface is ridiculously unintuitive and bad. It is a good game overall but definately not worthy of the current technology. But then again, anything after Call to Power is going to be a good game."
3,Not an upgrade,"This is not an upgrade of the Microprose version of Civ II. It has new features but also lacks many of the old ones. It is harder to get information and give orders. If you have played II until tired of it, the change might be refreshing, but if you don't have II or have it and still like it, forget III. It also has nothing to compare to the additions in Civ II Test of Time.If you do get it, make sure you have the recommended processor speed--500 or better. At 333, even with all the graphics turned off, I keep a book by the computer to read while waiting for the game to catch up."
5,"Beautiful visuals, great sequel","Civilization II was my all-time favorite computer game. This long-awaited sequel improves upon it in almost every way. The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay is compelling. Playing Civ has always helped me see the world in broader terms, in the context of four thousand years of history instead of the narrow limits of modern pop culture.Civ III adds a lot of intriguing new concepts (flooding enemy cities with propaganda, war weariness, charismatic leaders emerging from successful battles that you can then use to mobilize armies). I do wish that certain other recurring features in history had been included, however controversial (slavery, different alternatives for addressing crime etc.) But diplomacy is SO much improved over Civ II.I'd recommend this game to anyone interested in thought-provoking, well-executed strategy games--I'll be playing it for a long, long time."
5,NO MORE LIFE,Not really just kidding. This game is freaking awesome. I'm like totally addicted to it. And playing it took me off the online gaming circuit for a bit. Which after a few months is starting to save me money from those monthly payments.This game is running just smooth even though my machine is ancient as heck. running it on a 400 mhz amdk. with a rage fury pro and a soundblaster. this thing runs smooth as ice once i set it up properly.
2,no improvements for the money!,"ok first off, this game is WAY too expensive. the only redeeming quality to civ3 is that the graphics are much better than Civ2. maybe a few new units? (i didnt play long enough to find out). alright if you have never played a Civ game before and are thinking about buying civ3 as your first, DONT. buy Civ2 definetly. it is far easier to understand, not as confusing. I own civ2, it is one of the most incredible games for the PC. I couldnt wait to play civ3,but when i did, I was not impressed at all. its the exact same game for...extra...bucks and the layout is much more confusing. now, if you have played civ2 or own it, PLAY CIV3 BEFORE YOU BUY IT!!! i cannot stress this enough. my conclusion, for first time civ players, buy civ2. if you own civ2 already, play civ3 b4 you buy it. i hope this was helpful for ya :)"
3,Give it back to Activision,"I wish Activision still owned the Civ name. Then we would have a new game that goes past the year 2050 and explores what the civilization you have might accomplish under water and in space. All water is in this game is a void with a few food squares. I miss the animated advisors from CivII and the battle views, wonder movies, number of civs to choose from, and future tech from the CTP games. Sure the game is beautiful, but it lacks in imagination. The new features of the game are riddled with problems that really stack the deck against the player. This game needs more than patches to fix it, an Expansion Pack could make it a truly enjoyable game."
2,Ummm....what happened guys?,"And to think...I bought Call to power II to hold me over till Civ 3 came out. What happened Sid? Why does call to power seem more like Civilization, and Civ3 seems more like a cheap rip off? I even went to the website frantically looking for an update of some sort that would turn the game into something worth playing. But of course there is nothing there, just alot of fan-fare trying to get poor saps like me to buy this game. It's a shame...."
3,Definitely Need a Patch,"Comparing to Civ 2, this version is a backward. The computers always like to make war. Even peaceful civ like Babylonians like war. This definitely makes this game more toward war aspect. Moreover, the AI just keeps sending settlers to every empty square on the Earth, even if the squares are behind your cities.Another backward is the user interface. All functions are hidden somewhere. I prefer the old window pull-down menu style.Nevertheless, some new features are good: culture influence; resource concept; special units; leaders. But the overall feeling is more like Age of Empire than a Civilization.This release definitely needs a patch to improve computer AI."
2,Where is the coal????,"The visuals are much improved, but I can't understand the global snipe hunt for resources. You might have all the technology for an advanced unit or improvement, but you are out of luck unless you can manage to wander over the planet and actually FIND all the resourses needed. I have spent 100 years at a time trying to find Iron or Coal and don't get me started on that rarest of elements, Aluminum. Spaceflight? So sorry, the only aluminum on the planet is controlled by that other civilization, you know, the one that has dedicated itself to your destruction? And, unlike Call to Power 2, the oceans are just there so your ships and subs have something to move around on.I uninstalled CIV II and reinstalled CTP2."
3,Wait for the price drop!,"If you've owned Civ 2, then Civ 3 will not impress you. Wait until the price drops on this one or you can get Civ 3 and Civ 3:PTW together as one package."
3,A little bit of a disappointment,If it wasn't part of the Civilization series this game would have gotten 4 stars but it was a disappointment after the awesome earlier installments of the series.The graphics are excellent and a nice improvement as is the culture system. But the game takes too long to play and the strategic resources can make or break a game. Too often I've played a game for hours only to find out that the few available saltpeter or coal squares are all far away from my vast empire and my neighbors aren't willing or are unable to trade for it.If you have the time (12-20 hours isn't unheard of for 1 game) then this is an excellent game to play. But if your time is limited check out Civilization 2 or Alpha Centauri for a great game.
3,More Options but less Bang,"I bought this game as soon as it was released, sight unseen. I do appreciate the advances in the look of the game buy frankly I was disappointed with the changes to the Wonders of the World -- I don't find them as ""useful"" to lie, cheat and steal for as they were in Civ II or even in SMAC and SMAC:AC. Of particular disappointment is Leonardo's Workshop. If you are interested in a long drug out slug your way up and micro manage your upgraded units, then you will love it...but if you are like me and liked have Leo's Workshop do that for you, then this change will annoy you. Many such changes were made to supposedly improve gameplay, but since multiplayer wasn't provided then this seems like a [bad] explanation. Better they had modified the Wonders at the higher diff levels then just sabotage them from get street.Oh well, still fun but not as fun as it should have been."
3,"Interesting and fun, but pales in contrast to competition...","...most notably ""Rise of Nations"". Which is why I wanted to briefly jump in and offer a quick piece of advice, if you're seriously considering buying this game, consider Rise of Nations first; it's more complex, less buggy, it has ""real"" multiplayer (that works excellent), and the graphics are considerably better.Hope this was a help..."
3,Part of a Disappointing Pattern,"I was a fan of the old Master of Orion game and like many others waited months for a promised improved version to come out. Never happened. Instead a superficially similar game, Master of Antares, emerged, twice as glitzy and sophisticated as MOO but not as interesting. I feel the same way about Civ III. I was hoping for something to extend the playability of Civ II, but it's just not the same. I still play Civ II while my copy of Civ III sits on the shelf.Still, both Master of Antares and Civ III are very good games, especially if you didn't play their predecessors."
1,Bad programmer NO donut,"This is the worst game I have ever purchased! I have been gaming for over 20 years, have the first Civ game...To play Sid's game you must only do it his way! If you play the game with your own strategy as opposed to one that the programmers thought up and HARDCODED INTO THE game, then you loose. Even at the very simply level you can only do certian things.Can you envision an enemey army getting into your country and pillaging to their hearts content? One enenmy unit can caputre all the workers & send them home? One pikeman can pillage all the roads... This is beyond bad/stupid.Did the developers expect you to ring all of your territory with troops so that no one can get in???? Not the brightest rock in the pile.This game has features that are a result of trying to be different than the last several civ games!!!IF I could give this game no stars I would."
1,Civilization 3 stinks,"I purchased civilization thinking it was a good game. Whatever anybody tells you, It STINKS! It was a bomb! Civ. 2 was far better. It's not worth it in any account."
1,Don't waste time and money on this joke of a game!!!!,"Worst Civ game i've ever bought,played it 3 times and smashed it into about 5 pieces and threw it in trash.Will never buy another Sid Meier game again,Hope there happy how they ruined A good game.Civ II test of time is my game they can keep civ3."
1,This game is as raw as the materials that made it!!,"First things first! I own AOE2 and play earth-consuming amounts of time on it, and love it! AOE2 has strategy mixed in with great gameplay and respectable graphics, as well as a special sense of unique civ. individuality--The best PC strategy game ever! Civ. 3 has none of the above going for it. There are many down right quirky unit inaccuracies in this game. (A knight defeats a tank--I don't wanna hear it).Also, it needs a much more commanding, loose-cannon feel - like you're the Emperors or Kings themselves ruling all, easily! But no, you're up in the sky about a mile (bad camera views) playing a bad game... within the game. Sadly and simply put: it needs more realism, etc. I recommend this game only if used to break someone's fall.THE-END"
1,if you could get it to install,"after six months, a new monitor, removing everything from hard drive, consulting the web page, emailing support, and getting tech support finally on the phone, even tech support can't get it installed. they blame install shield and say that i need the latest update - there is no update to install shield. fortunately, a lot of people at the computer store have had trouble with it so they let me return it, beyond the normal return period."
1,It ain't worth your money and time,"Civ3 is a defective beta quality game with bugs and performance problems. I love all the other Civ games including alpha centouri. Playing Civ 3 in comparison is no FUN and not EXCITING, but a lot of boring WORK like cleaning up pollutions. You cannot get emmotionally involved with the play as you would with Civ2, 'cause Inforgrame took out the talking high council and the wonder video clips. Because of the lack of the human touch you feel you are not playing against any other civilizations.The only good things in Civ 3, the concepts of culture, the civ-specific abilities and the resources, are overwhelmed by the flaws of this half-baked product."
5,Best Game I have,"I got Civ3 from a software order, not knowing if it would be any good. But little did I know I stumbled across one of the best games in the world! The civilized world at least. I got it a month ago and I love it, my advice buy it, buy it, buy it! Then you will know how I feel!!!!!!"
1,JUST A BAD FANTASY GAME PRETENDING TO BE HISTORICAL,"Civ 3 remains an unworthy successor to the great Civ 2 for many reasons. I could go on at length about the flawed concepts and bugs within Civ 3, but I will keep this short.Civ 2 was FUN; Civ 3 is not fun and can be very irritating with cumbersome interface, in-your-face AI, tedium, and other wacky things. Besides that, the history and ""realism"" has been made a mockery of. Civ 3 doesn't even pretend to attempt to simulate history or even give the appearance of doing so. So much of it, from stupid unit values to pathetic naval warfare, is just NOT HISTORICAL. Civ 3 is in actuality, a bad fantasy game pretending to be historical. Well, superficial graphics of Joan of Arc or Gandhi won't do it for me. No sale, even with its crummy expansion, PTW."
1,Computer Game Mega Flop!,"One would think that a new version of a classic game would be a tremendous improvement. Unfortunately, Civilization III would prove you wrong. The user interface is frustratingly slow. Press the ""enter"" key, and the game takes 3-4 seconds to recognize that you did something. Others, like the 'r' key for building railroads, do not work at all. Most importantly, the game prevents civilization advancements even at the easiest level. I've got cavalry and musketeers charging computer-generated catapults, archers, and warriors bearing stone axes in game year 1956. And frequently, my cavalry loses! The game's artificial intelligence is corrupt!So, don't buy Civilization III. Stick with the classic Civ II, instead"
1,Civ III a failure,"The game has some great additions, but the play has bugs or has been changed so much you never finish. This is due mostly to changes in waste and curruption, but the book does not spell out the great changes made in trade and negotations well. This led me to many hours reading the book and then trying to find the screen they were talking about. It seems clunky and with the waste and curruption problem, unplayable!"
4,Beware of this game - Overwhelmingly addictive !,"Sid Meier is back and this time his got his ""Civilization"" name on his game.For those who've never played Sid's games, be ready for a completely engrossing experience. If you enjoy the challenge of actually having to THINK when you play...this game is definitely for you. You are totally free to adopt an agressive or passive method to achieve world dominance or become the UN's Secretary-General or be the 1st to take your civilization to Alpha Centauri. Diplomacy is but an option !If you liked Age of Empires or Sim City and the like, this game takes their basic gaming elements but enhances and builds on them (resource management, city building etc.) and the gameplay is just unsurpassed.Be ready to spend all you free waking hours playing this game. Once you've installed it...it will become an obsession, beware."
4,Great game. But Missing the details.,"Civilization III is a fantastic game, and I would recomend it to people; it is the best strategy game out there. So why is it not perfect? The details are missing. The first thing that bothered me was that Civilization III forgot about some essential civilizations like the the Spanish. Secondly, the male - female leader swaps depending on gender are gone; but... The inspiring wonder movies are also gone.Aside from the graphics, the game is pretty good, however it would have been better if it had been more similar to Civilization II."
2,Civ 2 was better,"Civ 2 was a much more fun game to play. Civ3 puts too much emphasis on resources. If you can't find iron, you're basically [in trouble]. Sure, its more realistic, but how would you like to the ruler of Papua New Guinea and try to build a space ship without iron?"
1,Glitz over gutz,"If you like, what now is, run-of-the-mill game animation techniques and much slower game progression than the original Civ II (similar to 'Call to Power') and apparently the same 'heavy handed' levels of difficulty, then you will like Civ III.If you were hoping for faster game play, more control over your 'Destiny', and more sophisticated AI and more surprises, like I was, then you will be disappointed.I liked the old Civ II GUI and city window better, more controlable.In short, all I see added is a slicker but less funtional GUI and more limitations on what you can do, or how you can progress your civilization. The slow progression of the game, even after all the fancy animation was turned off was stifling. I never got past a few hours of very boring play.Maybe there are great new features after 1 BC, but I couldn't stand the slow game play enough to continue."
2,Call To Power is better,"Wow, was I disappointed with this version of Civ. I LOVED Civs I and II, but this one is a step backwards. Activision's Call To Power is much better, even though it had plenty of flaws. Civ III is VERY biased towards the computer. You will be hard pressed to build wonders, take cities, expand, advance, and negotiate. Even with the latest patches. In this version, they introduced the cool idea of having to have resources to build units. That's great, but the other civilizations will NOT trade them to you, even when you offer cities, technology, luxuries, resources, etc!"
2,"Okay, time to dig out Alpha Centauri again","Well, I LOVE Civ II, and I LOVE Alpha Centauri, so I, like lots of other people, was excited about the release of Civ III. I mean, it could only get better, right?Wrong.Simply said, this game isn't nearly as much fun as the other two I've mentioned. It's boring, with all the micromanagement; it's frustrating; the user interface is lacking; the commands are too limited; the computer cheats (such as kicking my tail with far less capable units on Monarchy level).I haven't had the patience to play this game to its fruition yet. Even if I manage to do relatively well, I'm not having enough fun to bother continuing. This is stark contrast from those long, sleepless nights playing Civ II and Alpha Centauri.So in short, don't bother with this one, especially for (...) or more. That money is better spent elsewhere."
2,Civ I & II Addict Finds Civ III Tedious,"I was a complete and total Civ I & II addict, staying up all night and developing ulcers running my civ. I pre-ordered my copy of Civ III and could not wait to get it. After patching it twice so it would run on my 1-year old computer without crashing, I was ready to rock! Unfortunately the game is just not as much fun to play, corruption robs your cities of productivity. The more successful your civ, the more tedious the game is to play.I can't really complain about the slow gameplay because of hardware, my computer is a 1.33 GHz, the game just is boring when you are winning and frustrating when you are losing (the computer cheats).Civ II is just way more FUN!"
1,The game that is illogical,"This game defies all logic. The computer routinely undertakes illogical endeavors that make the game more frustrating than fun. As an avid fan of the prior civilization games, I find this one to be utterly senseless. It is nealry impossible to compete with the computer because it is able to complete similar operation in half the time. I would suggest that consumers look elsewhere for a good developmental game. Look back to Civilation Call to POwer or Civ 2; it'll be far more enjoyable."
3,Great game with one little erk.,I just purchased Civ III and I think it is a wonderful game. Very creative and real. The only problem I have is the limit on how long you can play (up to yr. 2050). Why can't you just keep going if you want to?
3,Disappointed,Minimum differences compared to Civ2. You will find almost no fun to play it if you already played a lot of Civ1 and Civ2. A big disappointment.
3,can be addicting,"but it sure is hard. on the easiest setting, you'll more then likely spend the majority of the time at war with 7+ other societies who have an alliance against you. and if you want to keep up scientifically, you won't have any gold until you run out of achievements to learn."
3,"Civ 3 Interesting, but poor user interface","I know that Sid Meier is supposed to be a genius at UI, but the UI gets in the way of this game. It is sort of a real time, but turn based interface. When you get halfway thru this game, the number of cities and units that you need to control are large so that the games starts to bog down in piece management. You can't tell which piece has moved in the current turn, and you can't stop the automated action to move a unit or stop the preprogrammed movement of a unit which makes any coordinated attacks very difficult. You start to think about how to get around the UI instead of thinking about the game. This is really too bad because the game has some great ideas. The game takes a looong time to play, and in my opinion, not worth the effort."
2,"Yeah, so it's okay","It's okay. When you get to be a nation for approximately 6000 years, though, it gets kind of BORING. Yes, you can be lots of different leaders, but playing this game over and over you start to wonder which one you should be. And that's when the game loses it's taste.The Instruction Booklet is overwhelmingly long, so unless you can read VERY fast I recommend you don't read it. It's also filled with insults, like, ""most people don't want to buy the strategy guide, because it's not waiting in front of them.""It even has fake quotes, but if you're dumb enough they sold it to the right person.The people you play are varied between colors, so guys don't want to be France: 1)It's always pink 2) You look like Joan of Arc on the screen.There are some other things but if I haven't dissed them enough, I'll stop.It's fine if you're the smartest person ever."
1,Shabby...Bad Buy,"Sorry for the name but it's true.Okay, first of all it's a really bad buy. ...It seems to be a great game at first, because you can be so many people. But after a while you start to realize that it's hard to pick which one to be. I've played it over and over and I've won a lot, but the thing that got me really mad was the name of the hardest level-Deity. Okay, so they're not really mentioning their views on religion, but seriously, what if someone wins on Deity? What do they call themselves? God?Also, their choice of ""quotes"" weren't good. Unless you're too dumb to look it up.And, do you seriously think that the Zulus should be in there and not Israel?Sadly, It's not really my opinion that matters. It's up to you, but I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Great promise gone bad,I was hoping that this game would surpass Civ 2 in both enjoyability and replay value. It didn't do either. It was filled with bugs and it got pretty boring after only a couple days. Save your money and buy something else.
2,Not masochistic enough to play,"I've played both Civ1 and Civ2 into the ground, but Civ3 is collecting dust on my shelf. After enduring extremely buggy sound and crashing gameplay, I gave up finally because I couldn't win!!! I couldn't even compete. Even on Warlord, I was fighting for my Civilation's life every moment. The other civiliations seemed to be able to out-grow, out-produce, and out-fight me not matter what strategy I tried. And every time my civilization was finally going fine, all the other opponents allied together and proceeded to stomp me into oblivion. Okay, that kind of Challenge is fine for the harder levels- I like getting my tail whomped every now and again- but a player should have a decent chance to win at the next to lowest level!All in all- I'll go back to Civ2 which is much more stable and much more fun- no more Civ3 for me, I'm not that masochistic."
3,"Good, but not great","First of all, take the system requirements to heart. If you are on the low end, don't bother. I would literally sit for 2 to 3 minutes between turns waiting for the computer sims to finish their turns. On the other hand, my friend who has a top of the line computer could finish an entire game in one night!Secondly, there isn't that much different. To me, it just felt like a prettier version of 2. It's still fun, but I needed something more.And I wonder why if you can go up against 14 other civilizations why they all don't appear in your Diplomacy Advisor screen? Only the first 7 (or is it 8?) will show up. The downside of this is that you can't see who they're allied with or who they're at war with! (Am I missing something??)This game is still fun, but if you're expecting anything radically different, you'll be disappointed. If you're new to the series, you'll love this game."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"Civ III is a very plain derivative of its predecessors, Civilization II and Alpha Centauri. While the game had a lot of potential, it is a weak final product that becomes boring quickly. There are a lot of design flaws and plain bugs that ruin the fun or make the game tedious as it progresses. It's a rush job by the developer and publisher. I would hold off on this game until it has been thoroughly patched, or wait for the inevitable expansion pack to be released and then you might pick it up cheaper.I hate to say it, but this game was an enormous disappointment."
3,Did that just happen?,"Yes this game can be a lot of fun and yes it is, in fact, addicting. So what's the problem? Why are my tanks being destroyed by swordsman? Well, that would be the completely ridiculous combat system for you. An attack strength of 16 defeated by a defensive strength of 2? I have never, in all my gaming days, seen a game with a combat system this lop-sided in the computer's favor. Ever.Talk about frustrating."
5,A Classic,"I am glad to see that Civilization boiled down the basics of a great game and made a superb empire building game. Having played Civilization 2, I was a little worried that I'd be stuck micromanaging my empire with trade routes and trying to figure out how taxes and food all went together.They've streamlined the interface and made the game run smoothly. It is very hard to step away from. I also like the online help.I wish they would've put more movies in (like Call to Power) and show the histographs of how your civilization is fairing in the middle of the game. I also wish other civs would respect your boundaries as much as they want you to respect theirs.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend anyone wanting an addictive empire building game to purchase Civ 3."
3,"Good artistic work, bad strategic options","Graphics are excellent, sound is very good (but sometimes is reiterative), some decent music and diplomatic options are complete. What's bad, then?Strategy: it's so simple it doesn't seem a ""Sid Meier's"", and you cannot compare it with SMAC (Alpha Centauri) for example. Bad trade system, no more ""probe teams"" (spies) and some more things that are under zero, make CIV3 an option for beginners."
2,I try and try,"This is one of those few games that I purchased, played a few times and just put away for good. It's way too slow (I have a dual Athlon 1.8 gig processor box, what do you need a Cray?). You always have the feeling that the ""AI"" is nothing but a random number generator (I don't how many times I've seen a guy with an ax kill a more experienced guy with a machine gun).Plus they keep releasing patches and I keep finding bugs. I personally am giving up on the Civ3 series (and as an aside to other comments, I didn't like Empire Earth either)."
5,Easily the best game ever,"...It has to be noted that a lot of the gripes that people have, such as corruption, AI-to-AI tech trading and difficulty, can be changed in the editor that ships with the game. It should also be noted that the in-box game version is 1.07f; there is a 10MB patch available, taking the version up to 1.29f, that also fixes a lot of issues. So buy this game and download the patch....So don't be put off by all the negative comments; a lot of these people clearly have no idea what they're talking about. ...This is a superb game, and the customisable aspects will keep you playing and modding for a very long time."
2,Terrible Game: DO NOT BUY!!!,"If you are having any doubts about whether you will like this game or not, do not buy it. It is needlessly complex, boring as hell, and gives slow a new meaning. I bought it based on CGM's game of the year award on the box. I thought it would be cool. Boy, was I mistaken. The game has no linear plot. You set up the scenarios that you want to play.I can't think of one good reason to buy this.The games best features are merely mediocre when compared with others in this genre.The game's worst features are too numerous to name. Bad graphics, repetitive gameplay, sheer lack of anything resembling entertainment.I would have gotten more enjoyment from burning the fifty dollars I paid for this game. If you want a good strategy game, pick up one of the Age of Empire's games."
1,An utter disappointment...,Cid should be ashamed of himself...Your money would be better spent buying premium gasoline for a rented automobile.
2,I'll Make this short and sweet.,"Get Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, the true heir to Civ 2 instead.It's a game which trumphs this one in all respects except the trivial ones(like graphics)."
3,It could have been a contender,"Sid is a great man. CIV/CIV2/SMAC just a few games to mention. He has revolutionized computer gaming. But sadly CIV 3 is a graphic make over. It is CIV 2.5. Even additions of the resources, unique civ specific units, and culture do not make this game stand on its own.AI is lacking and very annoying (cheating too). Useless advisors. Slow game play (lag between turns could take up to 2-3 min). Constant warfare. No real scenario support. Editor is buggy. No multiplayer support.I got this game the day it came out. I don't regret it. I like it. I play it once in a while. Upgrade immediately to at least patch 1.21 if you get it. Anything before that is rubbish."
1,"Still, a DEEPLY FLAWED Game. A poor successor to Civ 2.","A year ago Civ 3 was released, being rushed to market in time for the Holiday buying season - just as its company, Firaxis, has rushed the Expansion for Civ 3, Play the World, to market.It took over half a year, and four patches to get Civ 3 free of most bugs and major problems; however, it remains a deeply flawed game with many bad concepts. It simplifies history compared to the great Civ 2, makes user interface cumbersome, and creates various annoying quirks with Espionage, Diplomacy, among others, all that while giving us lots meaningless superficial cute graphics.Civ 3 was missing many vital aspects, such as Multiplayer. Play the World, finally, gives us MP, but even that is messed up. It needed an immediate patch, which is inexcusable, and even then slows down an already slow game even more, while causing occasional crashes.Even with PTW, Civ 3 remains a huge disappointment, and an unworthy successor to the classic. Civ 2."
2,Civilization Weak,"This game does not draw you in. It is somehow less enticing than Civ II. It is cold, distant, and impersonal, and feels like the rival Call to Power. I hate to admit it, but Call to Power is better than this version of Civ., because call to power has neat stuff, such as underwater and space colonies. I did not find any cool units in this game, nor any cool concepts. ""Culture"" is a trick. It does not enrich the game, and often makes the conquest of cities frustrating because citizens rebel and overthrow you--give me a break. What this game calls ""culture"" is an empty word. Apparently you have to build temples in all your cities and feverishly construct ""wonders of the world"" to gain culture. Slow and uninspring, this game lacks any new imagination. There has been no progress made since Civ II in terms of spicing the game up and making it more interesting."
2,*Yawn* i am bored,"Yes like my title I realized that this game is fun for the first two dayz, but after the second day i dunt seem to be able to keep myself awake. The constent need to manage 60 cities is more than a nuisance. The so called computer ""governer"" that is suposed to help with the job of managing cities, is absolutly stupid. This game is almost exactly like Civ 2 only with better graphics. This game is not worth the price, but for those that enjoy spending lots of time doing the same tasks over and over again, this might be your game. Yet i estimate this game can only keep gamers intersted for at most 1 week."
2,Great Series,"I own Civ 2 and would rather play it than the new version. The new version is very complex and not that playable. Civ2 had the perfect balance of being complex, fun, and playable."
4,Civilization 3,"I was so excited to get this game that that is all that was on my mind for weeks.I was happy to see them combine a the best of 1 and 2 in this game. But I was a little disappointed that they took out some of the technologies of the past and they took away the video clips of wonders as they are built. I thought that was one of the great things about Civ. 2. I did think the diplomacy is much better. you don't have the problem of bleeding heart liberals amongst your democracy stopping your wars.Congress can't override you when you decide to start or continue a war.Overall I will still spend hours playing this game, and then hours making up to the wife and kids after they feel I abandoned them."
2,Disappointing sequel,"I own Civilization 1,2 & 3 and have played them all extensively & obsessively. Civ 3 is a waste of time. Gameplay takes too long compared to Civ 2 (the best). I still play it (Civ 2)from time to time and have finished it at the diety level. Civ 3 remains in its box. Frankly, I bought it because I enjoyed Civ 2 so much.Not recommended. The only saving grace is the graphics."
1,Any help with why the game crashes so much??????,"I've read great things about this game and purchased it. Initial setup went perfectly and I was playing for 5 minutes when the game froze. I didn't think anything of it and restarted the game. Again after playing for 5 minutes, it froze. After a few more times, I uninstalled the game and reinstall to see if that would change. It didn't it kept freezing after 5 minutes or so. I closed every application as recommended on Infogrames website and it still crashes.Does anyone know if there is a fix for this? I'm running on 1GHZ with 512mb ram, 64meg video card and good sound card so it meets more than the recommended system requirements.It's fustrating as I can't seem to find any help.If anyone knows the answer...please help."
3,"It's tolerable, but barely.","If you are a big fan of the civilzation series then this is a ""must buy"" simply to add it your sid meier library.The music, sound, and interface are fine. My only complaint is the the battle system is way off. There are times where a enemy spearman will defeat your legionary (roman special unit) and pikeman. Understand, there will be times when you will uninstall civ3 out of sheer frustration, but for some strange reason you WILL return.I wouldn't say that the computer ai is worthless, because you will conduct all your diplomatic transacations using a special ""interace"", but i dislike the way their enemy units will jump half-way across the map to take your colony or a worker.The replay value is fairly modest.OVERALL VALUE:civ3 is far from perfect, but it has gereat potential. With a expansion coming out in November 2002 and a patch available, civ3 should undergo some wonderful changes. Go buy it. : )"
2,"A short game, short history and short civilization","I started to like civ from Call To Power.Although I'll admit it's a fine game, there are several things I don't like. First, in CTP there is a short movie when you build a wonder, which looks cool and is one of the moment that I can feel my achievement. But there is only a stupit pic after your 30 rounds of work in civ III. Second, there is no entertaining to get into the war. There is no battlefield view to see your soldiers crush their enemies, all you can see is just little green bar turns yellow and red and then they disappeared. Third, it goes only a couple of years after current time, and the game is ending, there is no cool future techs. The most advanced ground unit is tank! Fourth, I don't know how to delete those games I have saved!Well, all over all, it's an OK game, but not worth 50 bucks!"
2,"Add a few good ideas, loose a million","... Civ 3 adds a few cool ideas and better graphics. It looses all semblence of working, and crashes like an airplane without wings. It removes the civolpedia and discriptions of the technologies. It ruins the game with ""enchancements"" like capturing catapaults. The scenario system pales in comparison with civ 2. And the ...background music... . Buy civ 2..."
1,Looks fun but won't run,"This program should've been through a few more rounds of testing. I've got a new system that runs plenty of hard-core programs (Think Half-Life, SC3000, Unreal) and has plenty of guts (1ghz/256mg ram/PIII/Gforce) but Civ 3 still freazes-up, errors out, and (this is the most frustratingly stupid) it layers words overtop of each other making important information impossible to read. I'm returning my copy tomorrow."
3,1950's style classic mystery,"This noir mystery by the acclaimed novelist James Cain is intriguing, but not one of his best. A successful businessman becomes engaged in an illicit affair with a married woman. When it becomes apparent she wants him to kill her husband so she may inherit his money, he tries to break it off. The woman's mother enters the narrative, trying to get him to continue the affair. (Guess what her motivation is?) Of course, the businessman has an affair with the mother as well. The story plays out in a predictable pattern, with no big surprises. If you're a fan of classic mysteries, or a fan of James Cain, this is worth the read. If not, it might be better to choose one of Cain's earlier works, such as The Postman Always Rings Twice, where his talent really shines."
5,If you have a pet.....you should have this book!,"This really is a very, very cute book. It's pefect for our guest's bed side table ( a feel-good read before turning off the light), the coffee table, any where really. It would make a terric gift for anyone who has a pet. It's one of those books that makes you smile, even if you've had a bad day. A friend told me about it and I'm glad I bought TWO. I'm anxious to see other books from this author; I love her sense of humor. I expect to see Bark Softly in stores all over; it should be there now. Great little book. I recommend it to every one!!!!!"
5,Fetch a Big Stick,"First, I love the title, Bark Softly. I just dig it a lot.I know that doesn't sound very erudite, but it's true.Stacy Lloyd's illustrations of her friend Jupiter are extremely eye-catching and fun. I, for one, am looking forward to the comic strip that one of the syndicates would pick up in a hurry. This book is definitely worth a look"
4,Tequila Body Shots Rocked!,This movie is finally on DVD! I can't wait! It's a funny and cool movie. I really loved Nathan Anderson(Paul). He was so funny and cool I laughed my butt off! Also Joey Lawrence(Johnny)is very cool. Just watch the movie. It's a weird plot but I liked it a lot. It's all about 3 guys and 3 girls invited to a party in Mexico and Johnny can read womens minds and he is just trying to save this girl played by Dru Mouser(Tamlyn). It's a not stop party atmospher and it hits the funnybone and just plain old funny. Watch it give it a try. You will be entertained! Believe me! Silly plot but cool!
3,Hmmmmm,"I interned as a PA on the set of this movie while I was in film school, and got college credit for it. They even had me as an extra during a classroom scene. I met the cast- they were all pretty nice but Rene Moreno was the coolest.I'm not sure I can say much for the final outcome, but working with the cast & crew was an interesting life experience."
4,Fun Movie,"Another good comedic horror. The movie feels a little dated in most aspects, but I really enjoyed it. The concept was generally creative, but I found the intangibles fun. The cast was pretty interesting and engaging, and the locations were fun - shot supposedly in Mexico. The final dream-like sequences were particularly effective, but a little too long running. For me, movies can be rated on several fronts - overall, quality of acting, etc. One of my most important criteria is atmosphere - how does the movie make me feel? If a movie is shot on a beach (e.g., I Still Know What you Did...), I tend to love it, even if the story is awful. In this case, those elements include a 20ish something cast, a somewhat exotic locale (Mexico, but with effective scenes that make it seem exotic), amusing humor, not annoying cast, and some generally effective camera work. I like."
2,Amazon.com listed wrong info.,STRANGE MOVIE!I only ordered this DVD after it came up during my search of actor Tony Keyes. Tony Keyes is not in the movie at all!
5,WHAT A SEXY MOVIE!!!!!!!,"I just rented this movie not only is Joey Lawerance in it,but it has a hot cast the setting is hot and the name of the movie is hot!!!!!! I totally think you guys and girls should rent this movie!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!"
3,Great as a reference,"This book is a useful reference tool for anyone who wants to write about death well. It deals mainly with forensics -- how you can rule out certain causes of death and circumstances of the crime. Some parts of it are dry -- others are anecdotal, which occasionally gave me story ideas but often left me bored. If you want to write a story with an important forensic element, this can be a great book. Keep it by you and read the sections you need as you need them."
2,Not enough detail,"Informative on a general level. The problem I've found with these Howdunit series is that they don't go into enough detail for me. For instance with strangulation I want to know how long it takes the victim to die. What exactly happens in a physiologic way? What are the differences between women or children strangling a man or woman? And vice versa. How about repeated throttling as say in SM? How do I write about what the victim is feeling, what the murderer feels. Yes, hand marks on the neck indicate strangulation by a person and a 'Y' shape means hanging. But this is not nearly enough information to put into the death scene. I want my detective to beable to get into the minds of the murderer and the victim."
4,Good reference for writers,"This is a good introductory level research manual for aspiring writers. It doesn't go as in-depth as I'd hoped, but it is a good starting point."
5,Dan's review,The book was very interesting for the information it provided. I decided to make it a part of my library.
1,sometimes ambiguity only confuses,"Chekhov wrote some fine tales--""Peasants"" probably being the best of the bunch. But I found the parable of ""The black Monk"" one of the most unsatisfying stories I have read. I am left not knowing what the norms of the story are: are we supposed to sympathize with the protagonist or reject his perversity? Is he a hero of sensibility victimized by ordinary people, or is he merely crazy and destructive? Who knows? As the story stands, I find it impossible to say. When a story leaves you straddling a razor, I think it is not a success."
3,Good not Great,"This book does provide good trail descriptions for a reasonable number of hikes in Vermont. I've hiked about a dozen of the trails listed in here, of those 10 there were:2 in which the directions to the trailhead listed the wrong forest service road to take.3 in which I saw other trails at junctions that weren't mentioned in this book leading to nearby attractions (without giving full descriptions it would be nice to mention alternatives for longer hikes available).1 in which the directions led to a difficult hike, but it turned out talking to people at the top that a much easier hike was available to reach the same destination from the same trailhead.Having said that, this book does give the visitor an easy way to plan some hikes in Vermont. The Falcon guide looks to be similar, so it might be useful to read both before planning your hikes."
1,Not worth the paper it was printed on,"This book was not worth the paper it was printed on. This bookwas a very difficult read because of the poor editing, and many factmistakes. Havn't they ever heard of a spell checker? I would not recommend this book for anyone interested in the mormon battalion. Rather, try to get your hands on a copy of Daniel Tyler's book. END"
4,Interesting and Educational!,"I teach a supply chain course and have integrated these videos into the curriculum. They're interesting and provide good insights for my marketing majors on the importance of quality and how manufacturing and marketing must work together. Not to mention, the students seem to find the manufacturing and distribution process interesting for the variety of industries represented. My one complaint is that I wish there were more episodes on two dvds than just the three: Harley Davidson, Peterbuilt and Anheiser Bush. But the three are very good."
2,This is a poor translation of an excellent book,"The translator of this volume does not seem to grasp what Nietzsche is trying to do. He omits passages that are important for understanding of the text simply because the importance of them is not always clear at first. He also omits the references that Nietzsche makes to his own earlier works. This makes the text flow more smoothly, but doesn't allow the reader the opportunity get a handle on what Nietzsche is up to, and doesn't give the reader a sense of what other works by this author might be of interest. Again, this is a good work, but there are better translations available!"
2,"Good book, Bad translation, do not buy","Ill give it 2 stars instead of 1. because it is not nietzsche i have the prolem with.I knew i was taking a chance by buying this, I like Hollingdale, and like kaufman, but this translater, takes the fun out of freddie. It hardly even sounds like nietzsche speaking. For one example a famous line is ""we all speak vaugly about poerty because we are all bad poets."".. When i read that line i barely realized i read it as he write ""we all speak abrtractly about our poetry because we tend to be indifferent poets."" The whole book reads like that. Nietzsche Bold statements! poetic prose are replaced with boring textbook like translation. I realized we might have a problem when i read the ""ABOUT THE AUTHOR"" in the book and he had traslated the title of ""THE GAY SCIENCE"" to ""THE JOYFUL KNOWING"" uhm.... I'm re-buying the book today the kaufman version. dont buy this."
3,An interesting translation,"At times brilliant, at others incomplete. Golffing sometimes comes up with brilliant formulations, but all too often his text skips over or omits details that should be included."
3,Nice toy,"My Grandson wanted this for Christmas. He can read and he knows exactly what he wants. I couldn't find this in stores so I looked here. This toy sells for $10.99 in stores like Walmart and Target. I finally found it in Target (though it was the 6th Target we had looked in). This is a really high price, but if you are desperate I guess it's OK."
1,Looks beautiful until you try to FOLD it,"okay, so I bought this paper to produce tri-fold brochures. I will agree with the other reviewer that it prints beautifully. BUT - as soon as you try to fold it, it cracks and the top glossy layer of paper peels away like a bad sunburn. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PAPER AGAIN. I have tried it in every possible direction in my printer but it is just very poorly scored. Do yourself a favor - buy regular glossy paper for one third the cost and fold it yourself - I guarantee it will work better."
1,HP has recently changed this product from a 5 star to 1 star,"I have been using the HP glossy TRIFOLD BROCHURE PAPER for inkjets for years. It was brilliant white, nice texture, clean, sharp folds and printed beautifully on fast-normal. It also matched my glossy business cards, perfectly. I just purchased a new box (which in itself was falling apart)that is now black with a gray illustration for ""Zuccotto"" on the front. The paper has a squeeky, gritty, sticky feel, the folds crack and are not clean but broken folds. The color is closer to an off-white. I am so disgusted with this that I am going to take it into every office supply store and show them the difference. If you buy it, look for the old blue box with an image of a green tri-fold brochure for ""Lending Service"" on the front. How can a company do this!!! If you have never used the HP tri-fold you may be impressed but, believe me when I say that it is a grossly inferior product compared to what they were producing within the past year."
2,Very Bad Brochure Paper,"The quality of the print and color on this paper is pretty good. The paper separates and falls apart upon 1 or for sure 2 folds. I bought the paper for the purpose of separating each sheet panel and getting 3 separate panels from each sheet so it worked O.K. for my purpose. If I had bought the paper for a true 3 fold brochure, I would have been extremely upset and would probably have returned the item. DO NOT buy this product for printing a brochure."
2,Definitely NOT photo paper,"Despite one very negative review, I took a chance on two boxes, but immediately returned one. Two stars is generous. I tried it on my HP 5650, which model number is NOT among those listed on the box and in marketing material as NOT among those printers for which this paper is optimized. This double negative unwinds this way for me: This paper is worse than lighter, less expensive, generic printer paper. The image quality is no better; the print quality is worse; the heavy weight offsets the advantage of two-sided printing; and the double-glossy paper jambs my printer's feeder. I would be embarrassed to issue a brochure of the quality I was able to produce. I'll revert to generic glossy premium photo paper to display photos and text. The 97 sheets remaining of this foul purchase may end up as packing material."
5,He Slimed Me!,"This is a most have for any fan of the movie. Slimer is complete with an asortment of foods and a slime stand. Also, from a money making stand point, the price is cheap compared to most sellers and the value will rise for the movie can stand the test of time. Buy it now!"
4,Neil Hellman - Autumn in the Valley,"If you like Neil Hellman, you'll love this album... more of the same. I own two of his previous albums and love both.. this one is great too. Great combination of celtic, eclectic appalachian classics set to mandolins, hammered dulcimer, harp, guitar, banjo and everything in between. Highly recommended."
3,ok for the money,"I purchased this product after reading the reviews here. But, I was surprised when I received it. Because, this product doesn't deserve such a great review. It feels like the cheap one you get in walmart. Now I know why is it cheap. May be people think about Paris Hilton when they wear this perfume. Thats why it got such a great review. I wouldn't buy it again."
5,perfect !,exactly as described.. the guy loved it. it's his fav scent & couldn't find it anywhere in stores! amazing & good purchase!
1,bad,This was supposed to be at my house by November 27th and has yet to get there and its December 21st!
5,The ladies love it!!,"Has a really nice sweet smell but not too sweet. And the ladies love it!! I'm always getting compliments on it and asked ""wow what is that your wearing? It smells really good!"" Great amount for the price!!"
4,"Just short of ""WOW""","A guy at work who has many similar tastes as myself, as far as style told me that of all the high end names out there, Paris Hilton for Men was by far his favorite. So I read reviews online..and people were absolutely raving about it! So for the price...I could afford NOT to like it. I have it, its nice...but it doesn't have the ""wow"" or ""next level"" scent that some of my other faves do (Jean Paul Gaultier, Hugo Boss). It is a nice clean fragrance, but a bit ""watered down"" perhaps? You'll find this stuff probably well priced on sale, but have it as a back up to your first or second choice."
4,Great sent for little money,"Great smelling cologne that isn't too sweet, for a lot less money than other colognes."
5,Grandson liked it!,"Got this for a gift for our Grandson who's in high school, based on the reviews. He said he loves the scent, ""..And so does all the girls"", lol. So, thank you to the other reviewers for helping pick a winner gift. His Dad said it really smelled good too, with citrus hints. Might have to try it myself, based on the positive response. The Amazon ""gift notes"" feature along with prices, makes it my go to 1st place for gifting occasions where the reviewers help zero in on safe bets for something new & different!"
3,Ok Cologne for MAN,This is and ''Alright'' CHEAP cologne for a guy.This only has Staying power I would say for up to 2 hours MAX.Ok for the Price $$ on Amazon .Smell is Average. Nothing Special.
4,Paris still has it,"Second time ordering Paris Hilton's line of cologne. I usually go all out and buy the expensive really strong stuff, but took a chance on her cologne awhile ago and its great. Paris knows whats this industry is about. Its really a good smell for summer or spring time. Everyone has a different chemistry , but this one for has a faint but long lasting smell. The thing the grabs me about this cologne is the natural ingredients. Sage..etc.. Great scent for outdoors or college crowd. Not a musky or macho smell but just right."
3,SCI-FI CLASSIC,"Asamiya has always been a favorite of mine because of how he is able to combine the classic manga style with mainstream American comic book art. As such, NADESICO is a pretty easy manga to pick up, read, and absorb. And hey, comics should be fun to read, right?In NADESICO 4, the epic conclusion of this space adventure, things comes to a close with an eerie ending that effects each of the major characters in the piece. Stakes are raised for each cast member, and the fate of the world...plus their very lives...all depends on how thier combined decisions will weave together into the ultimate outcome.Sounds like heady stuff, I know, but it's actually quite fun, and an easy read at that. Of course, I have to mention the art, which is a terrifiic blend of the usual manga-mecha stuff, a few buxom babes, and the classic Asamiya heroic archetypes.Ultimately, NADESICO is a great manga to start with if you're a longtime comics fan but you've never given manga a try."
4,Decent unit - storage could be easier,"This Rival GR201 20-1/2-Inch Cool Touch Griddle heats up fast and does a good job of evenly cooking pancakes, tortillas and flatbreads. I wouldn't cook anything greasy or messy on it because I don't want the grease splashing around in my kitchen.This unit is very easy to clean - a quick wash off in the sink does the job. A Cook's Illustrated reviewer touted the BroilKing $49.99 version over this unit because of size and more even cooking. The size of the Rival is generous and I have not had any problems with uneven cooking. For the $20 price difference the Rival is fine."
2,not good,"I used this griddle for some time and i know it's weaknesses. The non stick surface wears WAY too soon, and i take care of my surface. Additionally, the unit should be slanted so the grease drains better, although even if it was slanted it's hard to clean the groove. It is very clumsy to store. I'm looking for a new brand now. The plus is that it is cheap."
4,Very quick and easy to clean,"I enjoy using this product as it is a really quick way to cook a meal for the family. I am able to fit all of my meat that I am currently cooking on the griddle and since the grease flows into a cup the meat has less fat.This product is super easy to clean up, takes only minutes of your time."
3,7 good 1 bad,"I ordered 8 pen drives, 7 did work, 1 of them was defective. nothing to do! I live far from the US, the change was very expensive. I have one ornamental pen drive."
4,Great product but needs that vista driver.,This is by far the best flash drive i have ever had. Their is only one beef i have is that i was forced to upgrade to vista and the U3 software cant work on vista cause it wasn't made for that. I e-mailed kingston and inquired if thier have an driver. but they said it is in devlopment at the time so i will have to wait for that. on the other hand every XP computer i put it on with min security i can run the embebded software fine. O yea and it as a regular flash drive works fine on vista and XP.
3,Collectible but but kinda fun,I found this at a local Wal-Mart and I was lucky to find onea site on the intrenet sells it for $34.95 whch is toywiz my favorite toy site what aaaaaaaa total ripoff!!!!!!!!! whenretail stores sell it for $9.99!!! But anyway this is a set thatis not intended for play they barely move only their arms and commander cody moves waist and arms but obi-wan moves nothing!!!and the other 2 just move arms. I wouldn't recommend playing this because their sculpted models that are meant to be displayed not to be played and also the lightsabers and figures bend very easily!!! so don't them!!! But this is a good item to put in your collection!!!!!
1,Featherweight phone,I ordered the phone thinking it was a good deal. But it looked different on the web than it did when I received it. The phone is to cheaply made and is very light in weight that it can be knocked off the hook with a bump of a finger. More like a child's play phone.
5,GREAT BUY,I bought this for my son. I like the fact it came in different colors. Now we can tell which one belongs to my son and which one belongs to my daughter. Great item to have in the car.
5,Citrus reamer,"I've always been happy juicing lemons and limes with a large spoon. But now that I've got a lot of stiffness in my hands, this is my preferred tool.Easy to use and easy to clean."
2,"Good looking, but annoying to use","This juicer does a good job of getting all the juice out of citrus fruits. However, it also gets all the pips out, which means you'll need to strain the juice, or put up with them in your recipe.I wish I had bought a simple 'old fashioned' glass one like what my grandmother had. LikeGlass Lemon Squeezer / Juicer - Easy & Simple to Use !"
3,"Good, but I prefer the wooden reamers.","This reamer works very well juicing lemons and limes but is a bit too small to juice oranges as effectively as the slightly wider Oxo brand reamers that I have also used. If you are trying to make lemonade for yourself or juice an orange or two for cooking this product does the job, but i still prefer the wooden reamers. I prefer a press or electric ""spinner"" machine to juice oranges for OJ as I have found it is just far too time consuming to juice more than a few fruits at a time using a reamer."
5,"my review of ""Scent of a Woman""","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, especially the soundtrack and Al Pacino's performance. He definitely deserved his Oscar! I would recommend this film to anyone who can enjoy a fine film."
2,Carly Simon Fan in Virginia,"I'm another Carly Simon fan who is disappointed with her most recent CD The Bedroom Tapes. This spring two of my favorite artists, Kathy Mattea and Carly Simon released new CD's. I listened to them both on the same day. Kathy Mattea's The Innocent Years is excellent. Kathy voices a wide range of emotion (from the deeply moving That's the Deal to the light hearted BFD and many in between)and connects with her listeners as she vocalizes a spiritual journey. A CD worth listening to time and again. In contrast, Carly's The Bedroom Tapes is a huge disappointment. I've listened to it twice and doubt I will be able to sit through it again. The songs seem disconnected and shallow. Carly has experienced some of life but her songs seem to come from some other place. I recommend purchasing Kathy Mattea's The Innocent Years and holding out hope that Carly will find her voice again."
2,She paddles and paddles but never finds her stride,"There are some pleasant moments on this Cd. But on a whole it's a woman whose suffering and, apparently, quite lonely. The lyrics are pretty forced and verge on being trite. The voice has lost both its vibrance and poignancy. It's like this seemingly incredible woman whose lived this priviledged life has hit this major pothole in the road and longs for everything that once was. It's a very difficult collection to listen to both musically and as someone who has really admired her and enjoyed her incredible music career. I hope the next Carly Cd has something that reflects the wisdom and beauty as well as the pitfalls of a life well lived. This collection leaves me cold. Not a song plays on as I turn this Cd off."
2,"Bedroom Tapes, A Snooze","As one of Carly Simon's biggest fans, It truly saddened me to hear this CD, A slow sluggish affair at best, Where are all those great melodies of Carly past. The CD is folky, slow, and a real hard listen. I was so looking forward to this CD. Looking back at older Carly albums, especially those produced by Richard Perry, you long for the pop pleasures, nowhere to be found on this CD. Please Carly, get in touch with a great producing team, suggestions, Pet Shop Boys, Saint Etienne, Nile Rodgers, Remember Why!, To bring Carly into a more updated, upbeat, pop sound with her storytelling, would be magic, I gave this CD a listen with my friends and everyone found it to be tough going. Carly, Carly, where are you? One of your truly biggest fans, I loved Film Noir,"
2,I Haven't Got Time For The Pain,"This is so difficult to write being a long-time Carly fan, but this CD is a major disappointment. I am not sure why, but the only way to decribe this as being distant. The connectiveness I felt on previous offerings was lacking. By the third listening I was forcing myself to listen; it became that difficult and ultimately a disappointing exercise."
1,Disappointed,I have been a Carly Simon fan for many years and looked forward to a new release. The songs on this CD all sounded the same and there were no catchy new tunes to sing along with.
1,Who's Bedroom Is This?,"Bedroom tapes? Not my bedroom! Where is the real Carly Simon? Although ""Our Affair"" comes closest, these are not the romantic lyrics and music I waited for so long. I suggest you stick to vintage Carly, or just save your money."
2,mediocre at best,"Now I like Carly Simon and have often found her witty and caustically observant. ""The Bedroom Tapes,"" however, is mostly a whine fest. I had a lot of trouble even listening to the whole thing and it didn't get much better the second time. ""Our Affair"" is okay, if derivative, but ""Scar"" and ""I Forget"" are downright annoying, manipulative, self-indulgent drivel.If you are looking for an extraordinary album about raw despair, go to Joni Mitchell's ""Blue."" Look to ""The Bedroom Tapes"" for refined, cheap self-pity."
1,This is just awful,Amazingly awful. There's not a tune or an interesting thought on the entire album. I found it painful.
2,Below par,"Both in terms of the quality of song writing and the singing, this album does not match up to Carly Simon's own remarkable standards. There is too much verbosity and disjointed rendition. I don't agree with other reviewers when they say that Carly Simon has returned to her roots. She can do much better."
5,"An Astonishingly Personal, Confessional Masterwork","A brilliant, deeply personal masterwork by Carly Simon, who, over the years, has consistently produced insightful and smart songwriting with great depth and heart. The arrogance, insensitivity, and jadedness of some music critics never ceases to amaze me. Have they actually listened more than once to these complex songs? Are they so accustomed to never looking beyond the surface of a song's shimmering melody? Simon combines poignant introspection (Scar, I Forget, I'm Really the Kind) wirh sardonic and scathing wit (Big Dumb Guy, We Your Dearest Friends, Actress) along with irony. Although deeply confessional, Simon is smart enough not to take it all TOO seriously. There are few singer/songwriters who have touched us more than Carly Simon, and this exquisite collection continues the tradtion."
3,I Had Hoped For More....,"With the announcement of this CD, the first in a while for Simon, I'd hoped the wry, witty & sultry singer of the past would be back. But like Joni Mitchell, she disappoints. Whatever demons she intended to purge with these songs, are simply just not communicated in a manner to make me care.I KNOW Simon has a 5-star or two CD left inside her, and maybe this will help her along that path. Next time tho' - stop playing all the instruments yourself and bring in some top notch musicians who can stimulate the creative juices!"
3,Somethings missing?,"I received this CD in the mail this afternoon and couldn't wait to get into the cd player and sat back and listened..... and listened again and I found very few songs on this collection really went anywhere. I have always loved her voice, I have since I first heard her sing, way back in the early 70's where she penned most of her finest songs and melodies. In all her projects shes always had several songs with really nice smooth guitar fills Her writing here seems awkward and just doesn't take me anywhere and thats something I have, like the best Joni Mitchell songs, depended on and I'm hoping some of these will grow on me. I'm alittle dissapointed with all the talk/singing and strange confessional, feels like your listening to her phone conversations lyrics. Carly Simon is right up there with the best but on this effort it wanders to much."
1,"Nice poetry, but the music????","I was so looking forward to this collection. But, despite the interesting lyric writing, I found one song musically to be very like the next, and the next. I guess I will go back to playing the old favorites with which I can sing along and look the fool to my neighboring commuters; save your dollars for one of those tapes/CDs."
4,Triumphant...the best in years,"I'm surprised at the amazon.com critic's assessment of The Bedroom Tapes. The album is leaps and bounds ahead of most of Carly's 80s and 90s output (and I actually liked that stuff, too). Carly wrote and recorded a lot of this material while recuperating from cancer, and was certainly not ""going through the motions"". The results are a delight - Carly shines on each and every track. Autobiographical material like Scar and I Forget are amongst the finest songs she has ever written. Such inspiring, brave, confessional material is to be applauded. After many albums of highly-polished, glossy pop, it is gratifying to hear her try a rootsier, sparser approach to music making. By the way, the song Actress doesn't appear to have anything to do with Carly's stage-fright at all. I wonder if amazon's reviewer was actually listening to a different album....how else to explain such baffling, haughty and unprepossessing copy."
5,A very valuable addition to any manga artist's collection,"This book is an extremely well written guide to drawing manga for both beginers and advanced artists alike. IT includes guides on drawing the faces, bodies, hands, eyes, etc. that are well written and very detailed. It includes some bonus features as well, my favorite being the how to draw covers of manga, a critique of work sent in by other artists as well as a redrawing of the originals, descriptions of various popular and commonly used manga characters, and short helpful notes by budding artists in the field. Note, too, that the artist has had some impressive experience in his field, including work with Studio Ghibli and work on such international hits as Akira. Highly reccomended."
4,Disorganized,"While I enjoy the information in the book and much of the steps brought new perspective to me on how to draw, I found myself confused a few times until I continued on and found the answer later in the book.I do encourage people to use this book if they are trying draw anime and game characters, however be warned that the organization in the book isn't the best.(in my opinion of course).All unpleasantness aside, I enjoyed the special section for game characters and groups, I Never really thought about why I was attracted to some posters and not to others.Buy this book, but be warned of its disorganisation. If it was more organised, I would give it Five stars."
5,I feel like an artist!,"After a quick review of this book, I was able to draw some very interesting anime characters. The instructions were clearly defined and well drawn. Such fun!"
5,Perfect for beginner,"This book has really helped me build skills in manga drawing. Out of the 20 or so books I've purchased for manga instruction, this is by far my favorite. Vol 2 (Expressing Emotions) is also a great find - definitely pickup both."
2,....yawn...,"When I 1st picked this book up I was rather excited...only to be dissapointed.the only reason that I gave it 2 (instead of 1) stars was because I found the page on head angles and body proportions rather helpful. And thats about the only thing you'll find of much use(and it's only 1 page!).The book has you drawing cubes to break down the body when circles and cylinders are much faster, easier, and far more effective. There is also no section on how to do hair or hands,and a very bland,unhelpful section on eyes.just""how to's"" for generic characters.NOT a must buy,so dont waste your money."
2,Need to hire an editor! The answers in the back are WRONG!,"Hope you have an excellent teacher when using this book in class. In my case, Dr. Rotar, my teacher, makes this class a breeze. Higgins and Keller-Mc Naulty, the authors of this book really should have checked the answers in the back of the book before going to print.This book is horrible. The only reason I can understand anything is because my teacher corrects errors in the text.Loved the class, hated the book, steer clear of this one if you can!"
2,not for me,"I chose this book because I read ""Gossip"" and thought it one of the best books I have read in a long time. Not so this one. TThe beginning of the book was very good, interesting and entertaining, but it went suddenly downhill after that. The last thing I want to read right now is a book about a political campaign. The story dragged on and on and then abruptly ended I found it crashingly boring. I will try one more book by this author. If I had read this one first, it would be the last."
1,UGH!!,"I truly don't know why this book got decent reviews. I am ashamed to admit I actually read the entire thing. Much like the ""Nancy"" comic strip I felt compelled to read when I was young but never really enjoyed. Save your money and your time for a book worthy of both."
2,One-dimensional characters,"The premise of the book was intriguing, but the characters weren't realistic or likable. I especially didn't like the one who decided to run for public office -- her husband had recently died and she had five children who needed her at home, not running around campaigning! And every one who knew her kept telling to go for it, which was simply ridiculous. I had to practically force myself to finish this book; it just didn't hold my attention."
2,"If you're looking for a smiley-faced ""lite"" read, here it is","This novel is definitely a piece of fluff, the kind of book that one might romp through during the course of a transcontinental airplane flight. It tries (too hard, I think) to be ""inspirational"" to women, with its everything-turns-out-great trajectory (kind of like some of those old ""B"" movies from the forties), happy coincidences, and saccharinely portrayed, totally predictable triumphant moments. There are lots of squeals of joy, hugs and kisses, and happiness-is-a-warm-puppy events in this one. There's even the obligatory ""mystical ingredient"" that seems so integral to women's novels these days. I suspect Beth Gutcheon can do better."
2,Like toilet paper -- use it and forget it,"This book was a page-turner but I really disliked it. All the characters are upper-class (after all, they meet at an exclusive spa that costs some ungodly amount) and the challenges they face are not, for the most part, of a life-or-death nature. Interesting characters are introduced to move the story along and then dropped as unneccesary, the reader can see plot developments from a mile off, there is no real tension to the various plots, and everyone lives happily ever after. Vast amounts of money make ""happily ever after"" a lot easier to attain. The moral of the book seemed to be that friends are nice to have but only if they are really rich. I read ""Domestic Pleasures"" several years ago, enjoyed it immensely and recommended it to several friends who felt similarly about it. Other Gutcheon books that I have read (""The New Girls,"" ""Saving Grace,"" and ""Five Fortunes"") have been tremendous let-downs. I think I'm giving up."
3,"Entertaining, but not Gutcheon's best","This is definitely an entertaining read, but it's far from being Gutcheon's best. The characters are well-drawn, but their various situations don't always ring true; everything seems to be wrapped up a little too neatly in the end for all concerned. The story tends to meander from one incident to the next, leaving the book with a somewhat unfocused feeling. Still a good read, but I'd recommend starting with ""Domestic Pleasures"" or ""The New Girls""."
4,One of Gutcheon's great reads!!,"Despite what some readers wrote for a review this was a great book. Yes the characters had money, which made it even more interesting, can't as adults we still live in a fairy tale world. It's fiction, if you want the facts read a non-fiction book! Great characters that were very loveable and easy to get to know. They did face real problems from rape, random violence, death of a spouse, politics, becoming a 'mother', and the love of friends. Definately recommend this book as well as other Gutcheon books."
5,People you want to know,"I was totally absorbed by this book, and actually learned something from it. These were all women who started out damaged or vulnerable who learned it was up to them to change their lives. It's been a while now, but I remember the section that affected me most was when Solange, the psychic, told the overweight daughter that she was ""building a shrine"" to the person who hurt her. That hit me where it hurts. These were all people you'd want to spend more time with, and I was sorry when the book was done. I love Gutcheon's style and can't wait for more. I've read most of her stuff, and this and Saying Grace are my favorites. These would make great screenplays!"
4,Makes me want to read all her other books,I am about halfway through this right now and am really enjoying it. I do find it a little implausable that these women make a connection on vacation and continue it at such great lenghts once back in the real world. But it does make for great storytelling. You are really taken in to these women's lives and can't wait to find out what happens next. You find yourself really pulling for them. Anyone who enjoyed DIVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD will really enjoy thi.
5,"This is a moving, upbeat, charming, very of-the-moment story","Gutcheon's book has charm to burn -- in the unwinding of the story, in the framing of the characters, and in every sentence. It has, and don't take this wrongly, some of the appeal of Danielle Steel's work -- a good yarn, sympathetic heroines, a touch of fantasy and glamor. But it is a very literate version of the Steel type of novel, with art and wisdom in every sentence."
2,Too Non-realistic.,"I immediately couldn't get into this book with its unrealistic characters. It seems like a made-for-tv movie or Danielle Steele novel. If you liked the Ya-Ya's, Pilot's Wife or Memoirs of a Geisha don't get this one."
4,VERY GOOD BOOK,"This was only the second book I read by her,I found it very good, the only thing I am not too crazy about is I think she drags certain things on a little too long. But I will read more of her books."
2,Disappointing - Very Topical,"I'm not a big romance reader, but this one seems like it would appeal to that crowd. Very fairy tale, even with author's attempts to set it in everyday society. The plot lines are pretty far-fetched and the Cinderella outcomes are just too unbelieveable. What world-famous movie star gives a darn about anyone they happen to meet at a spa? It was a tad embarassing as the trade paper look of the book fooled me and I was responsible for my book club considering it - then choosing it! This is far from being fiction worth discussing at a book club meeting - much more of a beach book."
3,Sad :(,"Stones are NOTHING like pictured, extremely cloudy/dirty & there are black ""spots"" in stones. Since the stones are fake, i expected MUCH better FAKE quality! I emailed. They did apoligize & asked me to mail it back for an exchange/refund. For the price, i can't see paying to mail it back w/no guarantee of recieving a better version! Very disappointed, but you do get what you pay for!"""
2,Not the best sound,Very forward presentations of warhorses readily available elsewhere in better fidelity. You can hear tape hiss or similar non-musical interference even in the MP3s. Suggest moving on.
3,Classical Thunder,"Classical TerrorPurchased for 1 selection. Not that keen on the rest.Overall, the music is great but not my choices."
1,Return,"I had to return the item because even though it says it fits most GE Roasters, it did not fit mine. I wish it would have had better measurements of the unit and mentioned it had squared corners instead of rounded.But I was very pleased with the return process offered."
2,Big disappointment,Don't waste your time or money. Very little information here. I like my books to have some text. If you just like to read lines then this is the book for you. I sold my copy at the local chess club. I usually like Olms books.
5,Sharing Christmas Stories,"I sent this book to my grandchildren a couple of states away. It's a Christmas ritual that I send several Christmas books for them..it's more fun for me than for them I think. I got raving reviews from all of them. The children are 6,4,and 2. They wanted mommy and daddy to read it over and over again. I was so pleased they enjoyed it so much!"
5,VERY GOOD CHILDRENS BOOK,RICK OSBORNE DID A GREAT JOB ON THIS CHILDRENS BOOK. EVERY CHILD SHOULD HAVE A COPY OF THIS AT HOME
4,C-R-E-A-T-I-V-E !,"I don't think I've ever heard anything quite like this CD. Nash, Garner & Romano definately do not follow the crowd. It is very creative and imaginative, with wonderful textures and suprising twists and turns...almost like an interesting movie score. Very much mood music. Richard Nash is fabulous on the piano. From the dreamy, intimate ""Starry Night"" to the playful ""Dalai Lama Song"", this indie is a very nice first CD."
4,C-R-E-A-T-I-V-E!!!!,"I don't think I've ever heard anything quite like this CD. Nash, Garner & Romano definitely do not follow the crowd.

From the dreamy, intimate ""Starry Night"" to the playful ""Dalai Lama Song"", this indie is a very nice first CD."
4,Melodies through my mind,"A quite amazing thing happened after listening to ""Asleep..."" a few times. I was minding my own business and the melody from ""Summer Storm"" entered my head and wouldn't go away for awhile! It was as if I were listening to the CD. What a pleasant experience! This CD spoke directly to me and I would recommend it to any of my friends."
2,from Solo Piano Publications,"I really, really wanted to like this album with the intriguing title (from ""The Wizard of Oz"") and interesting cover art. The dedication to the three musicians' music teachers also piqued my interest, but no matter how many times I listened to ""Asleep in a Field of Poppies"" or where I listened to it, I just couldn't get into it. On several tracks, the piano is badly out of tune, and on several more, the percussion seems out of place and overpowering. Many times, the thought crossed my mind that the album seemed very amateurish and unfinished. Most of the songs are at the same slow, easy tempo, but that gets boring without at least a few changes here and there. Some of the songs are very pleasant, but then the drums come in with an indication that something dramatic is going to happen, and it never does. A better piano and less percussion could make a big improvement."
5,Great debut Album!!!,Steve has done an incredible job on his debut album. I have followed him from ABV to Newsong and his solo career has blown them all away. Can't wait for his followup music!
2,Basic minimal quality,Cap was like stiff felt. It was not soft. It seems to keep a distorted shape. I liked Jaxon products better.
3,Super Reader,"Doc and his men become embroiled in a mystery surrounding a mining operation in Arizona.A man, pursued by a bunch of hoods, ends up dying of poison, pretty much on Doc's doorstep. Being pursued by a bulldog with poison-tipped metal fangs certainly did not help his odds.Monk's beautiful assistant Lea is captured, but manages to leave them some hints via some quick thinking.They end up in Red Skull Canyon, in the aptly named city of Skullduggery. This could have been a Scooby-Doo episode, if you toned it down a little.The leader of the gang of saboteurs out to profit from the mining operation is not who you think it would be."
5,K'nex are great,The K'nex are the modern day Lincoln logs and erector sets. This product gives the kids a chance to use their imaginations and use of hands to actually build something and then play with it. It is a good mix to the electronic toys that just entertain them (and doesn't take any batteries).
3,Good but not Great,First of all my binoculars were assembled wrong right out of the box. It caused the eyepieces to wobble and affected focus. I'll have to send them back to get them fixed. Construction is good (they feel solid) and rubber coating gives a good feel in th hands. Optics are good but not great. The image is only in focus in the center. Not at all what you would expect from Bak-4 prisms. The case is nice and they have a good neck strap but the little plastic connector pieces for them are junk. These binoculars are made in Japan so if you are expecting the quality that you would get from the Irvine California plant you will be disappointed. They boast a limited lifetime warranty but have so many exclusions it is hard to know what would be covered. All in all though they rate with the other Japanese binoculars in the (price) range and are probably a good value.
3,"Crisp image, maybe misalignment between two scopes","The images are very crisp, only a little blurry at the edge. However, I suspect differences between two scopes is the cause for my eye strain. Especially I suspect problem with alignment of prisms."
4,"Good, cheap binocs","I have expensive Leica and Nikon binoculars but needed something good that I could carry around with me and not worry about getting stolen, dropped. These Meades were perfect. Cheap, very good view for the money. Good to keep as an extra pair when someone shows up and you don't want a novice using your Leicas. I appreciate a good view and the center resolution on these is very good."
2,Was great when they worked properly,"I purchased these some time ago to take to Yellowstone NP and they did a good job. I used them on occasion to view stars while at home or check out red birds in the trees. They have been stored on my shelf for about a year and was packing to go to Alaska and took them outside to test. I found that focus on the right side could not be achieved. Also, the views were off on each side not lining up. I guess if I dont mind just looking through one side im ok, i take very good care of my things, i own a Meade LX10 Telescope for years and it works flawlessly, the one thing i would have thought would never be an issue would be the binoculars, never dropped, just stored on my shelf in the case....what a shame."

1,This is not the text.,"This is a 38-page pamphlet containing 1162 mostly one-line notes to Euripides' Alcestis. There are some English notes, but this pamphlet is meant for someone who can read Greek."
1,Not so good,This book is not what I was expecting. It's really not good. You can find better IQ books if you want.
3,Recommended by Mensa?,I used this book when I was a teenager to measure my IQ. I scored 128. I was tested by a psychologist in a hospital and was on the border between superior and very superior intelligence with no number given. I took the two Mensa tests. I scored 117 on the culture fair exam. Then I scored 151 on Cattell B which apparently rates as 134 on the Stanford-Binet scale. That was enough to get me into Mensa. I have recently taken the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ) and scored 580 verbal and 740 quantitative which translates as an IQ of 139 on the Stanford-Binet scale. I have a physics degree and achieved 2:1 honours but I was told I was borderline 1st class honours which according to the Eysenck book requires an IQ of 140. I can only surmise that these tests are testing different things and that intelligence can be defined in many different ways.
2,OUTDATED,Be sure to brush up on your old dead movie stars and antique cars. How could such an old test be valid for anyone (except maybe your grandparents)?
2,"Good Theory, Narrow Tests","I found the purpose, factors, and theory of intelligence testing to be interesting.However, I found the scope of the tests to be limited. For example, word knowledge is of far greater importance than word use (i.e reading and writing), and arithmetic skills are emphasized over problem solving skills (this especially annoying, as I am from a generation that has relied on calculators during schooling). Another problem is that the tests in the book are so similar, that by the end anyone can be a ""genius."" The tests did not probe much creative thinking either."
4,"Good recording, I bet they're even better live.","When I listen to this recording, it feels like I should be in a club or bar with a beer in hand and dancing my arse off to a live band.This is one of those bands that you just know is fabulous live. That is not to say that this CD isn't good, it's just that it's missing that special something that you know the band has, it has just not been captured on the disc. It's hard to do; it's rare to find a CD that does it well.That being said, this is a fun CD with some good jazzy pop songs that will make you want to jump around. With song titles such as ""Hottie"" and ""Candyland"" you know this band is in it for the sheer fun....and fun it is. The songs all have great melodies and the musicianship is outstanding.Swivel Hips is a very polished act. Great musicians, great voices and the knack for having a good time."
3,good book for the home library,"Mr. Buxbaum gives a very thorough account of Hillel and the circumstances surrounding his life. I found that the discription of his teachers and the state of Israel at the time to be very insightful in understanding some of Hillel's well known phrases.My only negative criticism is that many things in the book are repeated over and over again, giving the impression that Mr. Buxbaum had a pre-set number of pages he needed to fill. Basically, it could have been shorter.In all, I got a lot out of reading this book."
4,A neglected topic,"If you are looking for juicy details of scandals past and present, this isn't the book you want. But it is a set of thoughtful essays about the impact of an accusation, and the reasons why an accusation may be misguided - or malicious. It isn't unknown for there to be cheating in tournament bridge, even at the highest levels. But there have also been accusations made, and still repeated and believed by some, where much of the bridge world believes the accused to be innocent. In particular, some of the top US players of the 60s and 70s seemed to be ready to accuse almost anyone who beat them. What is it that led to this situation? Cathy Chua argues that differences in world-view and style meant that often, the US players simply couldn't understand how European teams (especially the Italians) were winning, and the US so often finished second. It sounds, at first blush, ridiculous - except that it is a hypothesis supported by evidence. A thought-provoking read."
3,adaquate,could not determine if item was newserver purpose adequatelyexorbitant shipping given weight of item
5,Gift for hubby,I gave this to my husband as he was boarding his plane for his trip to Bandon Dunes. He loved being able to research the area before he got there. He thought it was perfect. Recommend.
3,I found it interesting to a point.,A bit too much about the subject. It was informative and I got all I needed to know about it long before it's end.
5,Complete the Bandon experience,"When I saw this book on the shelf, I knew I wanted to read it and I was not disappointed!After three fantastic trips to the Bandon Dunes resort, this book completes the journey.I was very impressed with the courses on each trip and after reading this book I will even enjoy the next trip on a new level.The book is a very easy read, actually kind of hard to put it down. I highly recommend the book to anyone that has played the courses, that is planning a trip and to anyone that wishes that they could play the Bandon Dunes courses.I only wish that the book would have included as much information about the new Bandon Trails course as it did on Bandon Dunes and Pacific Dunes.Thanks to Mike Keizer for creating the Bandon Dunes experince.(I hope course number four is in our future.)Read the book and play the courses....you will not regret either one!"
2,A little disappointed,"Unlike the other reviewers I was a bit disappointed with the CD. It's pleasant stuff, but having heard Tams sing in the Sharpe's Rifles series on PBS I was expecting more period, or folk music. So some of my disappointment is jsut that it wasn't what I was hoping for. The first two cuts have a country/western sound, and except for the ""Spanish Bride"" (which merely borrows from ""O'er the Hills and Faraway"" and ""Spanish Lady"") none of it's trad, although it might fit under modern folk. The talent is there however, so I am going to check out his other CD."
1,Beware,This item looks better on the internet than it does in person. The earrings are small and the diamons are CLOUDY! I sent them back the moment I opened the box. I never ordered jewlery from the internet and I never will again.
5,Should have bought this book first!,"I love this book. It is full of great ideas with easy to follow instructions. I am now going to get double prints of all photos I want to use for scrapbooking. The ideas will definately kick my displays ""up a notch""!"
4,"Interesting ideas to branch out photos, as long as you're ready to print multiples and do a little minor kiosk photo editing.",I really like looking through these pages and it took me viewing it twice in person to decide to pick it up. This book is really fun with new ideas if you're willing to get multiple and b/w and sepia prints as well as horizontal or vertical flips. I think I might be using some of these techniques with patterned paper in addition to photos.
5,Cutting Edge Photo Cropping,Very creative ideas. Different than most books. I really like the fact that it shows you different ways to use your photos in creating a page.
2,smashed tea,Tea was fine. One of my favorites. Boxes arrived in horrible shape. All of the boxes of tea were smashed and broken. You would not be allowed to sell in store due to them being opened. I will not buy again
2,Sorry; just not a good tea:(,"To me it's just a bland tea. Nothing special about it. PG Tips and Brooke Bond Red Label is better by a country mile in terms of flavor, after taste and strength. Not bad tea, just not a good tea."
1,English Breakfast in name only,"This was once a very very good tea with lots of full bodied flavor and scent. Then a few years back the corporate suits looked at their bottom line and gambled that there are enough Americans who can't really distinguish good from mediocre, so why not cut back on quality and cruise on the Twinings name. Judging by the stellar reviews of their product, they made a smart business decision. They bought cheap leaves and dumbed down the taste to a brackish, uninteresting non-event.Compare this stuff with Tazo English Breakfast tea; you'll taste a hige difference. There are probably some other good E.B. teas out there, but Tazo is fairly widely available in my area. Sadly, Lipton followed the Twining trend toward mediocrity, so they're no better."
5,Twining's EBT is the best.,"Please stop sending it to me until I order more. Of Irish, Scottish and English, I like English slightly better. They are all great."
1,Hay is for horses,"If you've tasted real tea, then you know that Twinings tastes like hay. Cut open the bag and look. I think they share ingredients with Lipton;)"
3,"Good tea, STUPID USPS","Of course its good. Its Twinings English breakfast tea. Tastes more like a good Indian tea. maybe because it is blended with Kenyan and Assam tea.I am never going to do business with USPS. The delivery attempt failed so I had to get that from their office and because government agency's policies are made by morons, I couldn't get the parcel because the name on the parcel is an abbreviation of my name. So I had to show them an ID that had my abbreviated name on it. They said my electricity bill (It comes on my roomie's name) is a proof of my address but not of my identity, so it wasnt enough."
5,Tea Me,"This is my go to tea. I can't start my morning without and I insist on taking it with me on my travels (I swear to gawd if someone offers me Lipton's one more time...). Twinings isn't always available my local grocery stores so I'm grateful for the opportunity to have it directly sent to my home in bulk. Recommended, y'all."
4,Tea,"I've ordered the product a few times and it is always shipped quickly, but boy the price has sure jumped drastically."
5,My fav tea,I paid a lot more for this in the food stores. I bought 6 boxes of it. From ENGLAND and Celon
5,Great tea!,I have been drinking this tea for years. It's flavor is wonderful and amazon is a great place to buy it in bulk and save some money!
5,Best Example of Saving with Subscribe and Save,"I start every morning with a pot of tea so it's pretty easy to say that I'll drink _X_ amount of tea within _Y_ period of time.Since I don't put sugar or cream in my tea, I can really taste the difference between cheaper English Breakfast Tea brands and Twinings. With the Amazon Subscribe and Save, I can afford to have Twinings, instead of a store brand for less than I can buy the store brand locally and it's delivered to my door with free shipping. All I have to do is figure out how often I need them to send it. What a deal!"
4,"A great, basic black tea","When I gave up soda I decided I would drink only unsweetened tea without milk (to cut back on calories) and I picked this up on impulse at a local grocery store. Thus began my addiction to Twinings teas. Yes, it is more expensive than Lipton or Tetley, but it is also better.English Breakfast is moderately strong and if you steep this for too long it will become bitter; about three minutes is perfect for me, but you may prefer stronger or weaker tea. Overall, I think the taste of Twinings loose English Breakfast tea is better than the bagged tea, but bagged tea is more convenient. Twinings English Breakfast is great both hot and chilled and the price at Amazon is quite reasonable."
2,DSST preparation for the Introduction To World Religions,"There is some good information in this book, but your time would be much better spent on the actual reference materials listed on the Chauncey official website e.g. Religions of the World, Hopfe. I took the test today and it is fresh in my mind. The practice tests in this book quizes on information that will be usefull if one ends up on Jeopardy someday, but my advice would be to stick to the actual reference material. Good luck!"
4,very helpful,This book contains a variety of tests to prepare you for the Dantes exam. It is not a total help and you will need to research information outside of this book but it is a valuable resource for anyone interested in taking the exam.
4,Now I'm learning a hundred new definitions,"I recommend this book. Even if you feel that you're ready for the test, this book will have you doing much more research and backtracking. The questions are very detailed and a little tricky so it enables you to get a better understanding of the subject. I haven't taken the test yet. When I took the practice tests in this book I rescheduled it for a later date. I want a few more weeks to study."
5,Rare Fun,"Hanging out, waiting with my daughter in a Border's for some Harry Potter book or another to be released at midnight, I grabbed this CD on a whim. Never heard of the guy, but AMY Gilliom is a highly regarded Hawaiian singer. This CD knocked my zories off. Funny and sly songs like the title track and ""Beach Boys and Hula Girls"", smooth and evocative ballads such as ""Guiding Star"" about the recreated ancient Hawaiian canoe Hokule`a that has sailed throughout the Pacific, and a haunting duet with his sister, sung in Hawaiian. A remarkably accomplished and varied CD, one of my very favorites. Certainly not traditional Hawaiian, but an extraordinary talent building on that rich heritage in the best way. (By the way, ""Chow Fun"" is Chinese for a delicious flat rice noodle dish, wok-fried with beef, bean sprouts and onions. Insert your own metaphor here.)"
1,Disappointing. Not very helpful or well written.,"I was very disappointed with this book after purchasing it. It over-simplified serious issues, and tended to state the obvious. I found many parts of it demeaning to both professionals and clients. The authors also wrote a profile for Howard Stern's book, Private Parts. One wonders if he would be considered a difficult client. In my opinion, much of the content of this book is pop-psychology dressed up as real research."
5,Eureka!,"Finally, a system that works, that treats the clients with respect and optimism! And, a client myself, let me tell you, it makes all the difference in the world."
2,The World in Grandfathers Hands,"The World in Grandfathers Hands""The World in Grandfathers Hands"" starts out with a young Indian boy living in the pueblo. His dad is dead and lives with his mom and grandfather. When his father died he made his mother promise to get their only son a good education. They move to the city. It is a big change and he is having trouble making friends. One hot summer day he finally meets a girl named Claire. Claire is African-American and they fight racism together. Later his mother loses her job. When they are buying their food with the last money they have, his grandfather surprised him and bought food for the two homeless people that Jimmy feels bad for. I thought the book was alright, but it lacked excitement. There really wasn't a climax. The book had a very weak plot. I didn't really didn't like the book."
3,A strsnge new world,"The story is about a boy about 11 years old who moves away from his home in the pueblo. He moved with his mom and grandfather. His dad is dead. They moved to the city because of a promise his mother made to his father before he died. The boy was to be the hero of his people. This was a good book, I kind of liked it but it is not my kind of book because I am not into multicultural books."
2,Tastes truly aweful,"I have to say that isn't a review on the powder's effectiveness, but that's because it tastes so terrible that I chocked down my first glass of it and the rest will be thrown away. I have tried a lot of different protein powders and I got this one because of the high iron content, but compared to whey protein it is just disgusting.Again, I can't comment on its effectiveness as protein or a dietary supplement, except that its pretty ineffective to have something inedable as part of a diet."
1,Too gritty.,"I got this product because it was cheaper than ON's egg white powder and it appeared to be comparable nutritionally. Guess you get what you pay for... this powder is very difficult to get to mix up completely. It immediately forms clumps and just won't dissolve. You end up with a very gritty texture that is kinda stomach turning. The taste is a little off-putting as well, but I am able to overcome it. I've ended up having to make a smoothy out of it and add in a lot of things just to take the bad taste and texture away. Next time, I am going back to the egg white powder!"
3,Doesn't fit all treadmills,"Nothing great or bad about this rack, but it didn't fit my treadmill. Altought the descriptions says it works with ""virtually all"" machines, make sure to confirm it fits yours before purchasing"
2,Measure before you buy,Measure the depth of the controls on your treadmill prior to purhcasing this product. My console is thick and it would not fit so the rack was returned. It may be better equipped for a thin control panel.
2,Distance defeats purpose,This item holds a book but for some (including me)the 2.5ft. distance being located on the panel of the treadmill makes it hard to read. A better choice would be something that gets the book a little closer to you eyes.
3,Paid too much...,"I bought this kit because I do my own brakes and sometimes new brake pads do not include new hardware. Decent quality, expensive price, cost almost as much as the brake pads. Again the price plus + shipping is ridicules."
2,Soundtrack Falls Short,"The quality of this soundtrack does not match the diversity or depth of the movie. I wasted my money on this mediocre, whiny collection. Even ""White Rabbit"" couldn't save this album."
2,What is Up?,"For two of Laura Nyro's songs, that play such a big part of the overall soundscape of ""A Home at the End of the World"" NOT to be on the soundtrack CD is utterly ridiculous. ""Desiree"" and ""Gonna Take A Miracle"" are Bobby's (Colin Farrell) favorite songs and they are prominently featured in two long scenes in this movie.Duncan Sheik is fine but Laura Nyro has withstood the test of time: if she were alive today she would be beaming that two of her songs from the early 1970's are included in a film made this year. But for those of us who are fans, this is as it should be, for her music is timeless.As Bobby says: ""She (Laura Nyro) is a goddess."" Amen brotha, Amen.(both ""Desiree"" and ""Gonna Take a Miracle"" are on Nyro's CD, ""Gonna Take a Miracle"")"
1,why are soundtracks to movies disappoint,"i just don't get it. how do various wonderful songs don't make it to a soundtrac cd? what a disappointment! paul simon, laura nyro don't get included. what rubbish."
4,CUSTOM HOME,"The previous review couldn't be more correct, Laura Nyro's ""Desiree""and ""It's Gonna Take A Miracle"" should be on the soundtrack [a contractual problem, no doubt] Do what I did and download thesongs on itunes for 99 cents each. While you're at it, downloadYaz's early 80's electronic gem, ""Only You"" too [background musicwhen Jonathan was cruising the village] I also resequinced the songsin order that they appeared in the film. Problem solved!"
3,Not as good as it should be,"This cd is a let down. I have seen Kool and the Gang live and I expected the same show from this cd, but it wasn't there. For one thing, JT isn't there and neither is Skip, so find another live cd to watch."
1,Clamp support structure is poorly designed.,"I wanted this item for a Fit Trax, which has a large curved bar without a monitor. This looked perfect, as the only other choices are for placement on top of a monitor. The other reviewer was correct about poor design. The metal tubes on most fitness machines are round, not flat. The clamp is plastic, with a tiny little (plastic) disk on the end of the screw to hold it in place. It's not wobbly, it flops. Flat plastic slips on round metal. A good thing the designer didn't become a doctor. The little disk can't hold the weight of what's above, and it flops over. What it needs is ROUND above and under, with foam(?) grips to hold onto the metal. Anyone considering this should study the picture of the clamp closely, now that you know what to look for, and then decide if it will work for your machine. If I can't figure a way to anchor this thing, I will have to return it, as it's too pricy to eat the mistake."
4,works well,does what it is supposed to do but not as sturdy as i thought it would beover all tho i am satisfied with the product
5,IF YOU LIKE MOTOCROSS...,"If you like motocross, you'll like this series from the Speed Channel. I particularly liked the Bob Hannah installment. I've been trying to get a copy of it since before they made them available on dvd. Hannah is one of the more colorful riders of that era......to quote one of his competitors in the film, ""Bob made arrogance cool!"""
4,It was time,This is their best album since irreligious. This is a very good gothic/atmospheric metal album that you will sure like. After some listenings you feel a stable gothic feeling with a serious atmospheric and nice vibe. A must for Moonspell fans
4,OMH dog biscuits,I agree with another review in that too many biscuits are broken when they arrive at my house. BTW I had the same problem buying them directly at the store.I have fed my dogs these biscuits for about 25 years. The dogs love these biscuits but the real reason I feed them is because they are the hardest biscuits I have been able to find. The dogs take a long time to eat them and have to do a lot of chewing. This cleans their teeth. Since I started feeding these biscuits not one vet has suggested that my dog's teeth needed cleaning. I've probably had 5 or 6 dogs in that time and 5 or 6 vets too. I figure what I've saved in cleanings has more than paid for the biscuits plus the dogs like the biscuits.One thing worth noting is that my dog's diet is more than half dry food; I don't know if a dog on a wet food diet would have the same success.
4,Thumbs up!,"Sherwood makes the amps for many of the big names in the home theater and stereo market. This is my second Sherwood and I love the sound quality. Good work again Sherwood, I just wonder how they manage to keep their prices low."
5,great for the price,"Is there such a thing as too much Billie Holiday? This box consists of 10 discs and over 180 songs from Billies early career. Great stuff, clean recordings, but, no documentation except song titles. (Suggestion: go on line for Billie's discographies that list details (such as date, band etc.) Good deal if you'd like to really explore the actual music."
3,Mono recordings/weak mastering,"If you want to hear Billie Holliday as she would have sounded in the 30s and 40s then this is the set for you. As a matter of nostalgic curiosity it makes it worth the $20 price which is unbeatable especially considering the number of tracks you get. However, if you are expecting even basic stereo sound quality let alone the remastering of other recent boxed sets then you will be disappointed."
4,Chillin' w/ Teena,I've been a fan of Ms. Marie since I was a teenager and she's never let me down. This cd is just a small compilation of some of her greatest songs. Owning all of her cd's is a goal of mine. I definitely wasn't disappointed after this purchase.
5,Greatly Missed,I love Teena Marie music I was sad to hear that we lost her on the 26th of December. RIP SONG BIRD
1,Crapped out twice,"Had the device for a year, in that time it completely failed twice. I lost all my data, backups , music and photo libraries both times. The first time it was still under warranty so it was replaced. the second time I threw it out the window. In addition, the fan had been making a horrible noise. The replacement fan was $80 if I ordered it online and installed it myself. I wont buy a Maxtor again."
2,Maxtor OneTouch III problems,"I've had a Maxtor OneTouch IIIs for about a year connected to my MacPro desktop. When I shut down or restart my Mac, it frequently will not recognize the Maxtor until I turn off the Maxtor, disconnect the firewire cable, reconnect the cable and reboot the drive. I've tried the 400 and 800 firewire connectors with the same result. This problem has existed from the start beginning with OS10.4. The biggest problem is customer service. I've gone to Seagate's site and downloaded the latest drivers with no improvement. I tried their minimal trouble shooting guide to no avail. Worst of all, I've sent two e-mails using their tech support system and haven't had any response whatsoever. No more Seagate/Maxtor for me, thank you very much."
1,Do not buy Maxtor,"I am an Engineer working in Dallas, I bought 4 Maxtor One Touch III drivers one for my PC and others for may associates. Within 2 years, none of them working properly. One of them can't be recognized by PC. The others work not consistant. So we end up had to buy new ones, We tried a Hitachi 1T, it is current working fine. I am looking to buy a few more, but would not buy a Maxtor again."
2,good drive for just over a year.,"I use it to store HD video and work straight off of it with my MacBook Pro. It recently started making clicking noises and noises like it's 'ramping up'. Everywhere I read, they say that's the first sign it's going to bust. Now I'm looking for a new one before it takes all my years of video work."
2,"Works well, then fails after a time","I bought two of these drives to use for backups. I alternate daily backups from one to the other each night.I use the Firewire 800 port on each and have them daisy chained.One drive failed after a year and was replaced under warranty, the other drive failed after about 6 months and was replaced under warranty.The drives started reporting bad blocks and the Maxtor diagnostic reported an error code with a message to return the drive. Both drives had almost identical symptoms.These drives are pretty fast, quiet and appear rugged. But they are notvery reliable in the long run. If I were to do it again I'd buy a Seagate Barracuda drive."
1,Never received,"It is kind of hard for me to tell you how this hard drive performs since I ordered it from J&R Music and Computers back in August and NEVER RECEIVED IT!!! They took my money right away, but after several initial communications, I can not even contact them anymore. Not even sure if they are still in business. I ordered this product while I was deployed to Iraq. J&R says it was shipped, but have not provided any proof of this or provided me with the hard drive I paid them for 5 months ago. NEVER buy anything from J&R MUSIC AND COMPUTERS. THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF."
5,Oldies,If you like oldies I recommend you to collect the whole 1970's series that goes with 1971. They're all great songs.
1,An apt title...,The title tells all you need to know about the babble within. Same tasteless idiot who gets way too much exposure on TV. This is why we have boxes for people to think in...let some people outside the box and it is stream-of-consciousness drivel. Nothing but one attempt after another to get attention by being shocking and tasteless.
5,flawless!,"Don't have any idea what people are talking about when they say this is a ""noisy"" drive...are those shill reviews or what? Beats the hell out of my Dell's OEM Maxtor drive, which barely lasted one year before getting corrupted and starting to cascade.The Seagates now all have 5 year warranties---that's about as strong a statement of their quality and durability as you could ask for. Well worth the extra what, twenty or thirty bucks more than the Maxtors and Western Digitals out there. Got mine from newegg.com for just ninety clams shipped, they have superb products, service and prices."
2,Very Noisy,"This thing would be perfect were it not for the noise. Constant humming, can hear it in the next room. Other than that I have it partitioned into 4 volumes and it works very well, double the performance of my previous drive (10 GB quantum)"
5,Wonderful book!,"Excellent value for the buck. Great ideas for creating many things that don't require a large space, fancy or expensive equipment. With the use of your own creative powers, scrap fabrics and a little time you can have a small picture."
5,¡Escalofriante desenlace!,"Saramago logró con este libro traer la realidad y enfrentarla con su clonada forma actual donde ya no nos importa estar presente en el mundo como nos diría Heidegger y nos conformamos con tragar imágenes, puras representaciones de lo real. ""¡Somos nosotros, somos nosotros!"", es lo que se puede gritar ante la realidad de ver un ""mito"" de más de 2000 años convertirse en realidad. Excelente obra."
5,Plato's Cavern Myth meets Brave New World,"Saramago at his best! As most of what I have read from Saramago, this book is superbly written. One would never imagine that a novel written in a sort of ""stream of consciousness"" form, would be plesant and absorbing.The plot and characters are absolutely universal. The story could have taken place anywhere in the world, in the not so distant future, where man is living the desolate life he created for himself.Freedon is restricted, dreams are non-existent, and everything is colored in different shades of gray.Even though at first this may seem like a very sad book, it does have its silver lining: we still have a chance to make the world whatever we want it to be.Finally, a comment about the main character, Cipriano Algor: Suffice it to say he generates a very strong passion...."
1,Outdate Mouse?,"I purchased this mouse to replace the wireless mouse I purchased (late 2011) with my wireless keyboard (iMac). However, it does not seem to be a match, nor was it instantly compatible??"
3,Good customer service,"This vendor did a good job attending to my needs and making sure that I, their customer, was satisfied. Good service goes a long way and I am appreciative of the way they handled the problems that arose. If you have any problems or concerns, they will make sure to make you happy regardless of what it may take on their part."
2,"Great spare mouse, but can't depend on it","It just doesn't work as your one and only mouse.I've set up two high-end iMacs that came with wireless keyboards and mice, and in both cases I had to scrounge up a wired mouse to complete setup. When it cuts out, there is often no advance warning. It's vexing to re-sync without a working mouse.Seems many people use it as a ""spare"" mouse for their Powerbook etc. In that capacity it's an amazing, Apple-quality product. As for shipping it as the only mouse with a high end system -- what were they thinking!?"
2,"Hard to hate, but...","I have this mouse. I use this mouse. I don't like this mouse. It looks very cool with my PowerBook, and I don't think the battery life is all that bad. With that said, it does not track well on all surfaces - you need an even surface with a consistent color - when I use this mouse on the back of a book or magazine, it tracks all around. It actually works best on the carpet, if I'm sitting on the floor. A mousepad also works. It is not good for fine movement, either - it doesn't respond the same way a ball mouse would for fine tracking. I haven't used many other optical mice, but I think they probably perform better, generally, for fine tracking."
1,disappointed!!!,"Here is the original description from the seller ""Great condition! No scratches, very clean, very WHITE! Easy to setup, ships fast!"" But the truth is totally opposite. The surface is fully covered with scratches.. I chose this item because it's high explanation, even it was the most expensive one comparing with the other choices..n btw, there's no return policy for this storefront, so there's no doubt I was fooled by a trap, hopefully nobody else would take it twice here in this same snare!!"
1,Abysmal Performance !,"I love my G5 but the bluetooth mouse is horrible. I totally agree with the other low ratings. Performance is poor, wake up time is long and it requires new batteries every 2 or 3 weeks.What mainly drove me to write up on this low rating is the tme it takes for the mouse to wake up and start registrating mouse movements. It is very frustrating to get such abysmal performance fout of $50 a mouse acquired in 2005. I feel like I got completely scammed by it's cool look.Yes I'm buying one with a wire and will shatter this wireless one in front of the apple store."
2,Freezes often & poor battery performance,"Agree with Etta Wildberry & R Bakel - Poor battery performance-replacement every 3 weeks or so - I have started using rechargeables and change the batteries every 2-3 weeks. The wireless mouse freezes often-If you check out the web, this is not a new problem and has been existing for at least a year - Apple has not done anything about it and Apple CSR do not have an answer!(Makes one wonder if some of these glowing reviews are written by Apple employees!)"
3,Yeah sorta... will take some getting used to,"Having used the Microsoft Intellimouse with a scrollwheel for donkey's now, this mouse is something different.Gotta say that its difficult to connect to the Mac if the mouse has been switched off but not impossible.With only having one button, if the users tilt their hand to the right on the mouse, it will open the 'traditional' right click features. Takes a bit of getting used to this feature but it works.I like this mouse, it would be better if it was more responsive but with having the advantage of being able to place it anywhere on my desk, I'll stick with it! A good buy."
2,"Only one button, slow response","I just got one from J&R one week ago and have been trying it since then. I totally agree with those negative comments. The mouse looks great, but that's the only merit worth mentioning. One button, slow response would bother you all the time especially you are a guy just swithed from PC. I returned it to J&R. BTW, J&R refused to refund me with cash but store credit instead and told me this is what their return policy is. Disappointed again! I would say this is a total failure for Apple's mice designing section. So I suggest trying the newly released Apple Mighty Wireless Mouse (released on 7/25/06). It seems this new one has everything you need."
2,Maybe as a bar of soap?,"Yea, it looks cool, and matches the ibook (not so much my PowerBook) and the style of the rest of the apple line, but all in all, the only thing good about this mouse is that its wireless. The batteries run out at least once a month, and it only has one button. It integrates well with the computer and works great, but Id rather opt for a two-button, scroll wheel mouse that doesnt match my desktop. If you're willing to spend $69 on a cool looking mouse (this mouse used to be $69), check this one out (http://www.macmice.com/themousebt.html). Happy clicking!"
3,Fat Mouse,"For those who are used to Apple's wired mouse, be warned that its wireless cousin is a completely different animal. I like that there's no mouse cable to get tangled, but the wireless mouse is a bit overweight. Sure, it looks so sleek and attractive like the regular mouse, but the wireless version has two batteries shoved up its underside which makes it feel H-E-A-V-Y."
1,hate it,"Since I first got this mouse, it periodically freezes up if I have been away from my desk for an hour or more. When I come back to my computer, the mouse doesnt connect with the computer and I cant use it. The only thing that restores the connection is to restart my computer. Not cool.I called Apple support about this problem and they said that whenever I cam going to be away from my desk, I need to flip over the mouse and turn it off. This ""solution"" is a pain in the (...) for two main reasons - 1) it is inconvenient and hard to remember to do considering no other mouse I have ever used has required this of me and 2) it doesnt work anyway. When I DO remember to turn the mouse off and then I return to my computer and turn the mouse back on - it still doesnt connect. Jeesh.Save yourself the hassle and the extra $30 and stick to the old fashioned cable mouse.Oh yeah - the mouse requires batteries and you have to replace them about every 3 months."
4,My daughter loves this doll.,My daughter loves this doll. My daughter nick named is Tori. So when we saw this doll we just had to have it. She loves the outfits the doll comes with and the song Tori sings. My daughter plays with Karaoke Machine with all her dolls. My only complained is Tori's body is weird. I don't know they needed for her torso to alway to be point to the right. Other than that Tori is wonderful
2,Dissapointed,"My daugher just got this doll for easter, and first of all the doll is stuck bent to the side, and the leggs are too long for a barbie doll, my daughter had a hard time dressing her and the music box only plays one song"
3,okaydoll?,"The Tori doll is okay but her legs won't bend and she's ugly.And for heavens sakes,there is only one song in the karaoke machine! I mean, if i had my choice, i would probably buy the Barbie one. I also don't like the song!"
5,i love tori!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,tori looks sooooooooooo cool!!!! i do not like bratz they look bad.
1,Just Not Right!,"Zero stars, anyone?My 5-year old daughter loves it, because she loves to dance and sing, and loves Barbie, but if I only knew then what I know now, I would never have let her grandmother give it to her.This doll os way to sexy for little kids. Her shape and clothing are very suggestive. The skirt that she has is way too short. (I know she is just a piece of plastic, but I don't want my daughters to develop their fashion sense in a way that says that it's ok to be provocative)The karaoke machine is almost neat, but it only plays about 1/4 of one song....over and over and over. That gets old real quick.This toy also has lots and lots of teeny tiny peices that are easy to break, lose, choke on....you get the picture.The only reason anyone should buy this toy is maybe as a collectors item. It should never be removed from the package."
2,Ummmm....,She cant move really..her singing sucks but she is a pretty doll all they had to do was make some changes make her arms and legs shorter..make her move better...and make her sing a better song..and thats all..overall dont get her unless you want her for display..
2,I did not like this cookbook,"Most of the recipes I tried in this cookbook turned out below average in taste. Given that I've made good food from other recipe sources, I don't think I'm the problem - this book is."
5,best tasting lo-fat cookbook I've tried,"Cooking Jewish recipes without the calories and fat is not easy, but Norene Gilletz has done it. I haven't made one thing I haven't liked. Recipes are easy to follow, information tips are most helpful and I can enjoy eating without guilt and fear of gaining weight."
3,Not bad.,"This time W.Mertens tries to outdo himself:two pianos,three voices,whistle and percusion.Though the CD has its fine moments and is worth listening,it doesn't approach the level of his best piano and voice albums like A Man Of No Fortune...,Jeremiades,Epic That Never Was,Der Heisse Brei.If you want to taste the Mertens' music,I suggest starting with one of the above mentioned CDs,but not with Un Respiro."
2,Good piano. Strange voice.,"I,ve enjoyed this extraordinary pianist, but his voice is very disagreeable for me. What a pity!"
2,Not worth your time or money,"The book was somewhat helpful at times, but after using this book for a while I decided that I needed to break out the wallet and just buy a HELM manual ..., and I'm so glad that I did. If you have a Sedan legend this may be more accurate, but with my 1994 Legend Coupe it was really far off in many places and it's instructions are very vague. ..."
4,best book next to the bible,"my car broken. me fix car wiff book, i color picture. me drive car. me so happy. i like car."
5,I will use this seller again!,I ordered this book for my son. I received it on time and it was packaged correctly so it would not get ruined. We did have a problem with the first book we received but the seller fixed the problem right away and at no extra charge. The product was exactly what I ordered and in great condition. I will use this seller again.
3,Standard Haynes,"I have a '91 Integra. It's an alright book - pretty standard Haynes publication. Personally, I would prefer to see less pages (if any) devoted to things like rebuilding the whole engine (something I am very unlikely to attempt on my own) and far more detail on the typical do-it-yourself maintenance stuff. Not that I need someone to walk me through an oil change or anything, but for example, when one of the small coolant hoses on the back of the engine below the intake manifold was leaking, I couldn't find a single diagram in the book that showed any of the hoses back there. There are something like six or eight little hoses down there and it's very difficult to determine which one is which so that I can tell my parts dealer which one I need. The book was no help here (but neither was the Chilton publication). So, if you're familiar with Haynes books, this one is pretty standard fare."
1,amazon.com,your websites in ability to assist customers with book review/browse capabilities. I like to see what i am buing before i do go ahead and buy. can i view pages of book?
1,Just Don't.,"It worked about two times and then it broke. It's very fragile so if you DO end up buying this worthless thing, be very careful with it."
1,"Too frail, not worth it!!","I had this cord out of the brand-new packaging for 10 minutes, and it broke. One side of the cord stopped working and after giving up on it and opening it up for myself, one of the small wires had snapped. Waste of money."
3,"Works,but cheap.","I bought this wanting to trade my pokemon and it worked! It then broke on me. It still works though. It was cheap, so I should've expected it."
5,Kinberg's mamouth work,"Kinberg's Lexicon of Al-Farra's Terminology is indispensable for the study of Qur'an commentary and the works of the early Arab grammarians, such as al-Farra' and Sibawaihi. It provides both definitions in English of the special terminology of the grammarians that extends the definitions in even good dictionaries such as Hans Wehr, followed by copious examples in Arabic from Kitab al-Ma'ani of al-Farra'."
2,Trying to find words!,"After enjoying the first two CDs by Tom and Pan Ramajay, I must say that I was totally disappointed with ""Back for More"". I waited for more than a year before purchasing this CD...I should have waited longer. The CD definitely lacks punch. I'll keep my copy and still encourage other lovers of Steeldrum music to purchase 'Back for More', however, don't expect the excitment of the first two works by Pan Ramajay, It just isn't there. It's sad, for I still believe Tom to be a great writer."
5,Delightful book!!,"Flora of their Writings is a delightful book!! It is full of information on what to grow in your own Laura Ingalls Wilder and Rose Wilder Lane garden. What an original and clever idea!!"" Jodi, California"
4,ASAMIYA DOES IT AGAIN,"DARK ANGEL really caught me off guard. One minute you're in a fantasy world of babes and barbarians and suddenly you're faced with WWII tanks and armor-clad superhero types. The best part is that none of it really matters because it's all such fun.Asamiya is able to combine many disparate elements and blend them seamlessly into a pretty straightforward narrative, and that's no mean feat. His art, as usual, is stunning.DARK ANGEL 4 is an excellent read."
3,Eminem Animated,"This DVD features Eminem's animated ""Slim Shady World"" program as well as never before seen footage, interviews, and music from Eminem & friends. Eminem and Paul Rosenberg were actively involved with this production. The language and content are really explicit, the music is not totally satisfactory and the episodes are really short. If you do like ""South Park"", you might like ""The Slim Shady World Show"". Eminem-Character with red eyes looks kinda bizzare (Well,compared to Cartman he is a beauty :) I personally wasn't too fond of it!"
2,Not worth the money,"Eminem aka Marshall Mathers is great. His music is talented and he's pretty bright. However, I must say... this DVD is really not anything great. I was very unimpressed with it.. basically just a flash animation with Eminem crew voice overs. It has a very shallow and thrown together type writing for the script. There is basically no plot to this thing and the few times it made me laugh was to little to make up for the rest of the DVD. I give it 2 stars because the big E was in it, and for the 3 times I chuckled. Otherwise it was bad, just being honest. Go rent it or borrow from a friend if your really that interested. But if your going to be spending gas money to pick it up, think twice."
1,Taste and talent-free,"Attracted foolishly by the endorsements on the cover, I am ashamed to say that I bought this DVD. As an avid Southpark viewer who appreciates subtle (and not-so-subtle) social commentary, I was hoping that Slim Shady would present another viewpoint on our times. My hopes were dashed when this turned out to be exactly what I have heard critics accuse Eminem of being - taste and talent-free..."
5,Wonderful! Eminem Rocks! (Raps),"Wonderful! Way better than South Park! I watch it all the time, its really funny! Although alot of sexual content(beware) You can expect that from Em! I just love it! Let me tell you something, just buy it and I bet youll love it! ( enless you dont like Eminem)! eminem plays the voice of Eminem,Slim Shady,Marshall Mathers, Ken Kaniff, and occasional specail apperance people. The bonus is an D-12 video to fight music wich is my favorite video in the world! It also contains a special look at Eminem and trailers! Buy it now!"
5,Funniest show ever,"The Slim Shady Show is the greatest, funniest show that was created by the mind of Eminem/Slim Shady and I'm glad I bought it"
2,Good writing but storyline needs work,"I thought the writing was pretty good but that key elements of the story felt forced and in some cases did not make logical sense. In particular, the ending was full of holes. I would go into details but that would spoil the read."
1,Not for me...,"As nice as the cover looks - I don't think the handful of stitches in the back would be sturdy enough to hold it together, the way I'd use it. It might be okay if it had a sheltered life, on a desk somewhere. My journals don't, they travel, and they're with me most of the time. I returned this one."
5,lover of great horror movies,"I own all 4 movies and have watched them many times getting more out of them ever time. Most movies,example ""Jaws"",with sequels are ruined with the whole intensity of the movie gone. The Omen series on the other hand, to me anyway, gets better every time with each one having there own intense plot. The Omen 4, being well made mind you, I feel should have had more reference to Damion which would have made me and other Omen fans like the movie more."
1,Loves films HATE BOX!!,"I was shocked when I found that this review was exactly right:""Without a doubt this is the worst packaging I have ever seen on a movie in any format. It practically collapses under its own weight, the cardboard is so thin. Considering this MSRP I would expect much, much more from this. You could make a better box with old toilet paper rolls and a glue stick.""This would explain the very low $18 price that it now sells for."
2,NOT WORTH THE RIDICULOUS PRICE!,"I ordered my copy from Border's and after waiting 3 days over the maximum amount of days I paid for in the shipping, it finally arrived. Boy was I ticked. First off, I paid 80 bucks for a brand new pre-order. It arrived in a very badly used condition. It looked as if someone had sat on it. I say screw it and open the package and slip in the original 1976 version and listen to the item I mainly bought the Blu-Ray for: the isolated score track. It starts off okay then I notice a few of the tracks from the actual movie have been completely replaced by alternates leaving the originals nowhere to be found. I haven't even gotten around to checking out the other discs in the set but because I had previously owned the 2006 remake Blu-Ray I knew exactly what to expect. So far, it's a pretty set but not worth 80 bucks, and certainly not 130. Buy at your own caution."
3,The Omen BluRay Collection,"The quality of the movies in this collection is good, BUT the packaging was horrible!! It was cheap and not upto the quality that is expected of BluRay. I DID NOT USE FREE SHIPPING - But this item was shpped in an envelope - IT WAS CRUSHED UPON ARRIVAL (disks not damaged). I would certainly think twice before ordering an item like this again. PROBABLY I WOULD BUY IT FROM THE LOCAL BESTBUY!!!!"
3,Why is this box set now so cheap?,Why is this cheap now?Is there a deluxe set coming out in 2006 to tie up with the new movie?
2,"Really, was it that good?","I read the book Omen 2 on a flight to Vegas and I thought it was good book. I've been putting off buying The Omen set for awhile now and I finally got the set at a good price. The first one everyone claims is a classic and its hard to argue. Its a good film but I wouldnt put it in the top twenty horror movies of all time. The movie had its moments but I hate movies with religious overtones. Not a big fan on religion, wheter it be god or satan. The second film was alright but the rest of the series stinks. All in all, I didnt enjoy the Omen series that much."
1,LET DOWN BY ZERO EXPENSE PACKAGING.....,"A blu-ray collection of these films should be cause for excitement - yet even when taking into account Amazon's generous discount on this set - the packaging must be be one of the cheapest, flimsy and thoughtlessly conceived on the format. Every expense seems to have been spared. If your going to market Blu-ray on its high spec credentials - some effort in all departments might be an idea. Such is the paucity of the packaging here it would barely survive liberation from the shrinkwrap."
4,Were the bad packaging comments an Omen??,"After ordering this 4-disc set I read some less-favourable reviews on the packaging. I thought ""oops"" and half expected a mushed up box to land on my door mat after a journey of 6000+ miles across the Atlantic... Well it arrived safe and sound and I think the fold out packaging is a pretty good way to present these great films. Including postage costs 5 per blu-ray is pretty good value."
5,a scary classic horror dvd set!!!,"The omen came out in 1976, I think. It was after the exorcist which was one of the scariest movies made. i like this set it has all the omen movies."
1,What should i rate?,"the box set? the picture quality?i'll go for simply rating the movie(s)they were boring, boring, boringcall it whatever you want: mysterious, classic, thought-provoking...it doesnt change the fact that it was garbage. If i can't stay awake or doesnt keep my interest, its not a movie worth watchingi saw the remake, and even the remake as a bit boring (though MUCH better than the original)"
2,Poor,Poor packaging I don't even sure if I want to display this on my shelf with the rest of my collection.
2,Not worth it!,"The collection included a remake of the first Omen. I'm sorry but I didn't like it, and since they pretty much duplicated the first one, I just couldn't understand 'why did they bother'.?The last one in the collection wouldn't play in my DVD player, so I never saw it."
4,Very good set!,"Some of the discs look their age. They are old films but some of the high definition is missing that ""pop"" that you sometimes look for. However, the movies all play well with no hiccups. The set here is very smart to leave out the horrible Omen IV TV film."
3,Pretty Creepy,I saw these all Seperate interesting Concept at the time.the first one is far&away the best.the 2nd one has moments.the cool thing about films like these is the creepy element.the early ones aren't for the faint of Heart.very Interesting stuff.
3,Omen IV missing,"The movies are great, the HD is good. The only thing that disappointed me is that the 4 movie in the box is actually the 2006 remake, not the Omen IV so watch out.REgards.."
3,OK,"I was in the mood for OMEN, so i bought this... guess it's missing one of the films, the one with the girl, whatever. Watching the new OMEN movie was repulsive, it's just completely terrible with some The Shining visual shocks thrown in for cheap scares, not much else to say other than it is a worthless film and poorly acted. The original movie is still the best and the second one decent, the Final Conflict is laughable. Overall while one views all the films in succession one realizes, or at least i did at how flimsy the writing is, the screen play... it's just a joke playing off religious fears, biblical nonsense. What's worse is that they depict the anti-christ as a complete goof for the most part throughout the entire series of films. Other than a glaring death stare Damien Thorn is just an average goof."
2,I'd go with the Borodin,"Like the first two reviewers, I suggest you save your $85 for this set and go with the Borodin's 12 quartet recording (at $45!) instead. For starters, try the Borodin's 5 quartet, double CD for $10.99. It's a must to have, even if only for travel or use in the car.The Emerson's set is too harsh, too fast, focuses on technique and speed to the detriment of the music, and lacks an understanding of the complex emotional depth DSCH achieved in these pieces. The Borodin have an understanding that--and I've played them side by side with the Emerson's testosterone-laced performance--make it appear that this is entirely different music altogether. The Borodin's performaces are beautifully done. The Emerson's are hyper-charged misfires.The Emerson's recording history shows a wildly uneven output: their Brahms, Bach, Schubert, and Mozart CDs are great contributions to the oevre and quite nicely done. Their Beethoven (in particular) and Shostakovich are best avoided."
4,Bought as a joke - not one,"I bought this as a joke for my grandfather who loves hot sauce. It's no joke. He said it's hotter than the ""normal"" stuff he uses. ""Normal stuff"" to him would reduce other grown men to tears. Use with caution."
2,Not close to 11x17,"Color of poster is rich and bright, but if you were expecting an 11x17 poster than you should pass on this version. The size of the art is only 10 inches by 10.5 inches, the rest just the white paper it was printed on. No way you can find a frame for those dimensions.would have been helpful if the actual size was posted, rather than the word ""approximately""."
4,Totally awesome!,although a reflection of their early work it is still worth your time and money. i laughed for hours afterwards. it is truely worth all the hype!...
5,Let's Rock Shall We?,"Am I original or what!? BWAHAHAHAH! *twitch* Anyway.. this CD absolutly kicks booty! I love it! Who know one guy on a guitar could sound so good? (That *IS* a good thing.. i swear!). If you want a funny funny CD, get this one! It's great! Is it great? Yes it is!"
3,Could Have Been Better,"I enjoyed several of the performances on this DVD as well as the interaction between M. McDonald and his friends. The elegant P. Labelle's voice is fine form here and the guest of honor seems to appreciate her energy. T. Sims' and M. McDonald's collaboration is one of the more soulful moments of the evening; The melody and harmonies of ""All I Need,"" evoke the feel of many r & b songs from the 1970s. There was noticeable warmth between M. McDonald and C. Cross, who sings well and plays a nice guitar solo on ""Ride Like the Wind."" Kenny Loggins was a welcome presence, although I would have liked to have heard more of his singing on ""Heart to Heart,"" and ""This is It."" Low points include J. Bridge's ""She Lay Her Whip Down,"" E. McCain's ""Holy City,"" and an a cappella rendition of L. Bernstein's ""Maria."" How devastating to learn that Steely Dan, Ray Charles and Toto performed and do not appear on this DVD. Its a shame that mic and editing problems plagued a concert of this caliber."
4,A Tribute to McD,"As a big Michael McDonald fan, I'm taking one star off my review for a couple of reasons:The first is that I'm sure there were more songs in the actual show they taped for this special, so I feel the entire show should've been included. (I'm not sure, but I would think--with all that talent there--the show had more).The second is that I feel another DVD, the SOUNDSTAGE show, is a better feel of a Michael McDonald concert (it includes guests as well, but not the crowd that shows up for this DVD).Otherwise, of course, I'm going to have this. It's Michael, and he's singing a lot of his hits with the people he either wrote with and/or recorded with.So the DVD is definitely worth having to see so many stars together on stage.(By the way, that's Kim Carnes, who had the hits ""More Love"" and ""Betty Davis Eyes,"" and Amy Holland, who had the hit ""How Do I Survive?"" and is also Michael's wife, in the back-up singers)."
2,Missed the Point,"No one is a bigger fan of Michael McDonald than I am. This DVD proved1. While McDonald is a great singer, composer/arranger, and musician, he is not an entertainer. This DVD missed the point showing this great artist as if they were giving him the Lifetime Achievement Award for Back-Up Vocalist.2. McDonald was not the center of the show.....Where was HIS material?3. I enjoyed hearing many of the talented artists. However, I bought the DVD to hear Michael McDonald. By the way, Jeff Bridges should keep his day job.4. Should've had more of the Doobs, they gave him his shot.While this DVD was a disappointment, I'm glad I got it. I am still a fan and I sure I wouldn't have found it in the local stores."
2,Show Does Not Equal The Voice,"I am a HUGE Michael McDonald fan but found this DVD disapointing. The quality of the audio is average. The duet with Patti LaBelle was irritating - rather than sing, she shouts and screams amd screetches which totally ruined the song. I also thought Michael had little to no rapport with the audience. For many songs he only looks at his singing partner-not the audience. The Doobies were great. I felt let down by this performance. I expected a lot more from someone with Michael's talents. Maybe next time."
2,What were they thinking?,"I can't believe they expect people to buy this dvd! As a Michael McDonald fan way back from the Doobie Bros. time, I thought they really botched this performance. Some of the songs were very good but it seemed they ran out of good stuff and tried to use allot of fillers!!! And what the heck was Jeff Bridges doing there??? He can't sing!!! He should stick to movies!!! I rate this concert ""POOR"" !!! Sorry, but if you Love Michael McDonalds Voice, Stick to the CD's"
4,I was there!!,"I was at this concert in the sixth row when it was taped. Oh, my gosh, what a trip. We rocked for over three hours. I only wish more of the concert had made it to the DVD. Good or bad, this disk will forever be a part of my collection and collective memory. I got to speak with Michael in the afternoon before the concert and found him to be a genuine kind of guy. What a thrill!"
5,Great seller,"I accidently ordered this product. When I contacted the seller, she was very willing to work with me so I would be satisfied, either by exchanging it or she would give me a refund. I decided to keep the product and I love it. Seller was so nice to deal with."
1,What a switcheroo-it's a BAD Twinings!!!,"I am so disappointed in this new product I can't tell you. While Twinings states that this is the same product as their Indian Spiced Chai, I can tell you that it no more resembles that previous incarnation than a snake resembles a puppy. Twinings, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!! Please pull this off the shelves before anyone else gets hurt!"
1,Twinnings Chai,"Previously Twinnings had a product called ""Indian Spiced Chai Tea"" in a golden colored box. Since I could not find that I went to the Twinnings web site and found Twinnings Chai in a red box listed w/ the same ingredients as the other product. I ordered it. It is awful and does not resemble the quality of the previous product. DO NOT GET THIS TEA IF YOU LIKED THE OTHER TEA. It tastes fishy and there is no distinctive spice flavor. I was soooo disapointed. It gets a big zero!"
1,Awful,"Like other reviewers, I bought this tea because the box clearly states ""Formerly Indian Spiced Chai"". It is absolutely disgusting. While I was first upset that it tasted nothing like the Indian Spiced Chai, that was quickly replaced by anger as I realized that what I was drinking simply tasted bad. Totally gross. DO NOT buy this if you're looking for chai, or even for a tea that tastes good. I wish I could give zero stars."
1,NOT INDIAN SPICED CHAI AS ADVERTISED,"This is not what I ordered. Indian spiced chai comes in a brown-orange type box. I can get it in the stores but the closest store is 2 hrs away. When I ordered this, it pictured the box I am used to buying. Now while boxes can change, the taste changed a well. In a tiny corner at the top it says ""used to be indian spiced chai"". I am now stuck with these boxes and had to travel 2 hrs to get what I wanted. By the way, I have ordered this before with no problem. NOT HAPPY at all as I wasted my money and Amazon does not refund for this type of product. Maybe they could send me a coupon torward a different purchase.N"
1,Exactly where is the chai in this tea?,"I love having chai at home, so I purchased this tea at a local store. This is perhaps the most bland chai I've ever had. This is really a ""miss"" on the part of Twinings. Hopefully they will have the common sense to listen to customers and restore this product to the original Indian Spice Chai."
5,Great chai,"I love stronger spices in my chai and this pumpkin chai by Twinings is possibly the best I've ever had. I'd bought one box from another source, but immediately purchased this pack of 6 after tasting the tea. I don't get very much ""pumpkin"" from it; the tea appears to be more of the spices that are commonly used to season pumpkin. But it's yummy!"
3,"Not bad, but not the best chai","I'm a total chai tea freak, so when I see a chai tea that I haven't tried yet I pick it up.Twinings isn't bad at all, but there's just not enough ""chai"" in the tea. It's basically a black tea with the barest hint of chai spice."
2,"Not chai, and not very good either...","I have a love/hate relationship with Twinings teas. Unfortunately, the two I love best have been discontinued (Vanilla Black Tea and Indian Spiced Chai Tea). Since this tea claims to combine vanilla and chai, I decided to try it.It is remarkably bland and frankly, the chai spices are barely perceptible, whereas the vanilla taste is non-existent. It is not a particularly potent tea either. I also agree that there is an odd, slightly fishy taste to this tea. I will finish the box (I started putting cinnamon sticks in it to give it some flavor), but this was a real miscalculation on Twinings' part. I wrote them about it and they didn't even bother to reply. My guess is I am not the only one disappointed by this tea, and since it isn't exactly cheap, my advice would be to look elsewhere if you want chai tea."
1,Not the same Chai,The Twining's Chai became their replacement of the Twining's Indian Spiced Chai which stopped in production in June 2009.Chai became a sad replacement.It's difficult to find a Chai tea without anise seed (of which I'm allergic) but still have a good blend of spices and tea that encourages it's consumption. This is NOT that tea.
2,"A Better Name would Be, ""Cinnamon Oil Tea""",I have only recently discovered a love for Chai Tea but it could be only a certain brand. I really enjoy the Celestial Seasonings brand Chai which has more body and well-blended flavor. This had such a strong cinnamon flavor and it was more the oil-type not the cinnamon stick type. None of the other flavors stood out at all to me. I really like cinnamon but it reminded me of the cinnamon toothpicks we made when I was a kid. I haven't had much experience with other types of Chai so I can't much of a comparison.
5,Something Special,"I was looking for the India Spice Chai Tea by Twinings which I believe has been discontinued, when I found this tea. The spices are not overpowering and when made with a little sugar and cream it really brings out the full flavors. I have shared this tea with a couple of friends and they all commented on how much they really liked it."
3,Good taste but weak tea,The teabag has all the ingredients to make a good tasting tea..but the tea itself is ~very weak~. so I am not buying this anymore.just buy regular tea and add the following to itCardamomClovesBlack peppercornSaunf (fennel seeds)and it will taste much better.
2,Too much,I bought this along with many other brands of Chai Tea. This one was so bad I had one cup and gave it away. And I love Chai Tea !!
4,A compelling romantic suspense,"Annie Solomon has definitely improved in her latest novel ""Blind Curve."" The characters are well developed and likeable. I particularly enjoyed how the author emphasized some of the aspects of being blinded after having sight for all your life and how different it is to never having been able to see. The relationships both with the main characters and Martha and her father flow nicely and help the reader connect better. This is an author that I have followed since her first book. Each one gets better than the last and I am never dissappointed in having bought them."
2,A bit disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Ann Nesby. For me, this cd is average. I purchased it and played it a few times and then put it away. Ann Nesby being the great singer she is, I just expected more."
1,"Terrible, cost me a tow!","These cheaply made kits are a joke. A certified Yamaha mechanic shared with me that his belief is Sierra has started to undercut their customers by building these our of materials that they know won't hold up. After installing this whole kit, both of the gaskets that line the carburetors shredded within minutes of launching the boat. I was about a mile out and with a bad shoulder couldn't row back. Saving a few dollars on this kit cost me much more in patience and the expense of a sea-tow. Please don't make the same mistake I did and look elsewhere."
1,disappointed,"I received this quickly, but the video and audio was beyond horrible...even for a vhs! I would love to return it!"
4,I was there....,"A friend and I had long since wanted to to to CA and we finally did. Being at this very formal event surrounded by people who love and care about animals was such a wonderful experience. The ceremony was incredibly moving and I wouldn't be surprised to hear that there wasn't a single dry eye at the time. The concert was after the ceremony and you were able to get right up close to the little stage. While I was a bit disappointed that Paul only did his latest songs, he looked and sounded great, and everyone had a fabulous time. Having some of this experience on film is extremely cool. Those who say it's boring apparently weren't there. It was more than just a concert. It was about people being together and sharing a common cause. Maybe it seemed boring because the mood of the event wasn't always 100% happy. A lot of emotions were there that evening."
2,not so good,"In fact, the only good stuff on here is a couple of B52 songs. The rest is boring and low energy."
2,OK,"This is a book that should be read by people just starting out. If the suggestions in this book are followed, you may be able to retire happy, but it's too late for us."
1,price on vhs,"If it is a VHS, the price should NOT be more than $5, infact, should only be $2 + shipping & handling. NO WAY am I gonna buy it @ that price if it's not a DVD. I'm shocked that these movies (fav's of my childhood) haven't been converted to dvd! :-("
5,HORRIFIC,"This film is one of the most exceptionally disturbing horror films of all time. The lean, psychologically terrifying premise is played out with clever, revealing twists and turns that result in one of the most shocking and mind-bending finales ever. The performances in this Dutch thriller are exceptional; the tension and real anguish of the lead character's predicament -- he lost his girlfriend at a highway truck stop -- is palpable, and you will want closure along with him. As with every other reviewer below, I agree wholeheartedly that the skillful artistry of this mesmerizing, involving movie is all but gone from the same director's Hollywood-ized version of the same script, which exemplifies the dumbing down of American audiences. Rent or buy this original classic instead; if you have a taste for terror, this will be appealing to you, even in its horrifying conclusion."
2,Disappointing,"A good suspense movie is one that keeps me awake at night, or at least forces me to sleep with the light on!This film had no buildup of suspense or fright - the twist at the end was the only shock.Save your money and watch the original ""The Haunting"" with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom instead."
3,The tension Vanished too,"Without giving any spoilers, I'll say that the ending was a major disappointment. The girl's abductor is identified very early in the movie and, although his sociopathic nature as it is revealed through the course of the film is unnerving, the ending is hardly ""a genuinely chilling finale"". By the time the film wraps up, you're expecting something to happen, and when it does, you're left asking ""That was it?"" In fact, reading the blurb on the back of the box (or here on Amazon) pretty much tells you all you need to know about the film.For me, there was virtually no suspense or tension after the girl's abduction. There was very little of Hitchcock in this film. If you're looking for a foreign film with Hitchcock style and a truly unnerving ending, try Les Diabolique (the original version, not the Hollywood remake)."
3,Not a feel good movie.,"This movie is excellent illustration of how a psychotic killer can pass for an upstanding citizen. However the ending is depressing. Watch it for educational purposes, not entertainment or inspiration."
5,One of the most terrifying films I've ever seen!,A movie doesn't have to be gory to get to you. This one scared me so much that when we traveled in Europe by car I made my husband stand outside of the ladies room door while I was in there! Don't waste your time with the American remake. This is the real deal.
4,Amazing movie,"Excellent movie. After awhile it is so engrossing, I didn't even notice the subtitles. The story was very moving. Rex's search for Saskia even though it means he can not move on is very touching. I think that anyone who really loves another would come to the same inevitable conclusion that Rex did. Seems to move slowly, but stick with it because the ending is worth it. Stayed with me for days."
2,Gaahd!,"Having read Krabbe's The Golden Egg, watched this version and the American version of the films, I have to say I liked this one the best. But that's honestly picking which one I dislike the least. The story is compelling, but the way it's presented leaves much to be desired. This version stays very close to the book, but there are moments when I felt as though something was very wrong. For example, when the kidnapping is being practiced by the Lemorne, there is this bizarre, sprightly music playing. What's up with that? The acting in this version is so-so, with Rex being the character done the least amount of justice by his portrayer. Well, actually, he isn't a very rounded character in the book, so maybe he's portrayed the best. If you've read the book, you'll find this to be more satisfying than the American version. Hell, even if you haven't read the book, you'll be more satisfied with this one."
2,"blew it with the laughably contrived, hollywood style ending.","i actually liked this film up until the stupid ending. as if a man, after finding the killer of his girlfried after a 3 year search, would then wilfully allow himself to be drugged into unconsciousness and be at the mercy of that killer. this is the kind of melodramatic crap that hollywood dumps out it's rear end year after year. i turn to foreign and independent films for intelligence. what i found with this movie was a waste of time."
5,truly great sports videography,This video is from the exile skimboards sponsored team and has essentially defined skimboarding media in the last 10 years. Edited with a catchy feel that allows the viewer to enjoy the spectacle of pro level athletes. Fun music and video from the most famous skimboarding hot spots makes this a must see for all board sport enthusiasts.
3,Me Like It,"This was a case of, again, watching the movie first, and liking the music. Truth be told, I liked the music more when accompanied with the movie's visuals, but there are still some stand out tracks. My personal fave is the title track, everytime I hear that tune I get chills for some reason. This would be the perfect soundtrack to listen to while taking a long drive on a nice warm spring day down the coast. I'll have to do that when the weather warms up. I can't say that I love the CD, but I'm glad I own it. Even if there are a few tracks I'm not totally into, the ones I do like are tight, for real."
5,Works great!,I installed this wire set on my mom's 1991 Nissan Maxima SE. Works great. I also installed new spark plugs and the car seems to be driving much better now.
2,"Not ""The Rock""","Pros: relatively sharp, good shapeCons: handle is extremely light, poor balance. Knife is not suitable for anything that requires ""heavy duty"""
5,Best Traditional Gift !!!!,I had sent this gift to a friend of my mine on her birthday and she was delighted. She will cherish this for the rest of her life. The spice box was excelletnly packaged. She also uses the bag that it went in as a purse. Love this!!!
1,Waste King 1026 Drain Elbow and Gasket For Garbage Disposal Connection,Do not buy with garbage disposal this drain elbow is already included with disposal. Was extremely disapointed that this was recommended to buy with disposal.
1,Don't waste your money,The product's (Waste King 3/4 hp disposal) description failed to inform the buyer that the disposal included this fitting which led me to unnessarally purchase a duplicate fitting. Not happy with that buy. It would cost more to ship it back so there it sits collecting dust.
2,mixed review- GREAT product but my cats didn't like it,"This food is more like what animals SHOULD be eating- filled with real meats and seafood, etc. Not the garbage fillers you see is most canned foods. My kitties ran to the kitchen when they smelled the food but when I put it on their plates they took a couple of nibbles and left it. I tried this for about a week and finally went back to their original canned stuff. Too bad :(But I will say that they LOVE the dry cruncher food from Innova, they can't seem to get enough of that."
3,Good but LDS should not read this,"This is a well written book which manages to not push an ""anti-Mormon"" agenda. However as an LDS I do not think others should read it. Why? Because it could destroy your faith in the Church.I am not trying to be clever. If you enjoy all of the good things the Church has brought into your life, do you care where it came from? No other Church has so short a history that it can be examined so closely by science. Otherwise we would find that they are all created on the backs of con-artist.I am willing to bet every religion was founded by a fraud. So who cares. Does religion bring us together? Does it bond a nation, a town, a family? If so then let it be. The truth is fleeting, and life is short. If believing in Santa makes children smile then believing in God makes adults smile.When children find out Santa isn't real, you kill a certain spark you can never get back. When you expose a Church as a fraud, you kill a little spark in all of us."
1,Historical fiction,"It is amazing that someone so incompetent should be allowed to publish. This is history as a caricature. It is obvious that no one who knew anything about Egyptology had a hand in the production of this book. Larson is not to be trusted in his presentation of Egyptian language, religion or history. The pretty pictures do not redeem the book. The Mormons are probably laughing themselves silly at this parody of their history."
2,Good info but somewhat outdated,"This book contains some good information. However it lacks current research and data which refutes most of the the arguments contained in the work. At best it is a selective work picking and choosing data for a given position. Also a very great detractor is the bit at the end, bashing one faith in favor of another. Clearly there is an agenda by the author to win converts to his beliefs. If you truly are interested in Papyri, or even in ancient cultures, I would suggest doing your own research. There are alot more intruiging comparisons to be found with new information coming from recent sites and artifacts."
3,Novices Will Need More Help,"The book was very good at describing in broad terms how to make your first glass bead as well as some of the general things you need to know about flameworking beads and the equipment neccessary. ""Making Glass Beads"" did not provide the detailed pictures and instructions for each step that would have been very helpful as a neophyte. However,""The Complete Book of Glass Beadmaking"" by Kimberley Adams provides detailed step by step instructions with pictures of what you should be seeing as you form your first bead. Now that I have completed several successfully ""Making Glass Beads"" is a worthwhile book to have."
1,Excellent Book On Making Glass Beads,"This is an excellent book. I've had it for a long time and decided to buy one for my grandson. He is just getting started in bead making. The instructions are very good, with a lot of pictures to show you how to do the techniques. I would recommend this book to anyone getting started in glass bead making."
5,Making glass beads,"Dots, stripes, squiggles and so much more! As a new glass bead maker, this book is invaluable. I have already studied the techniques in this Jenkins book over and over and have put some of them into practice. This book was recommended by my teacher, Heather Trimlett world renowned bead artist. I have already purchased another Jenkins books from Amazon, 'Beads of Glass', which I highly recommend to anyone who would like to learn or perfect lampwork glass bead making.Beads of Glass"
5,Great book for beginners,"I just started doing glass flame working and decided to start with bead making too. This book is very informative and has clear step by step instructions and colored photos. It has a short section on the history of glass and glass beads, which i liked and it also shows you how to set up your torch. I just made a few beads today and encountered a couple of problems, I referred back to the book and the answer i was looking for is in the troubleshooting. I highly recommend this for beginners and people who wants to try making glass beads."
5,EXCELLENT,"Excellent book for beginning ""beaders"" like me! Step by step instructions and great photos.....you won't be dissapointed"
4,"Good, but bigger pictures would have helped","This book is good and has lots of info and useful tips. My only problem is that the images of the projects are quite small. I like to see big, clear images so I can follow them easily. But other than that, a really good book which I am glad I purchased."
1,Still Wrong,"Received the router bit on 12/21/2010. I thought the product mixup from the previous review would have been corrected by now. I still received the 2 cutter bit rather than the 4 cutter Quadra-Cut. It appears it is a mix up from the Freud factory. The packaging and the bit itself were both marked 99-003 which is the Quadra-Cut number, however the bit is the old style 2 carbide design."
1,Product Shipped not Product Advertised,"The first package amazon shipped me, wasn't the quadra cut bit, as is advertised on the website. It was a regular Freud router bit with only two cutting heads. The picture on the site clearly shows four cutting heads. So, Amazon shipped me another router bit. Again, the same bit, not the quaddra cut. As you may be aware, the Quaddra Cut Packaging, says Quaddra Cut, and has a yellow background this does not. It appears that they have either placed the wrong sku with the wrong product page, or they just can't seem to ship the right product, either way over a week and a half have gone by and I still have no router bit and will now have to rush order it from somewhere else. Thanks Amazon!"
1,Hate it!,"My Braun thermoscan has given me nothing but trouble.Yes this ear thermometer is easy to use. You just have to stick it into the canal correctly. Not hard. What I don't like is you can stick it in the same ear, the same way, 6 different times and get very different readings.Everytime I have gone to use my thermometer, the battery would be dead. You have to use the special medical circular batteries, so of course I would never have any handy. Then I got smart and started stocking up on the batteries. They are expensive. And everytime I would use it I'd have to put in a fresh new battery.This also needs the disposable ear covers in order for it to work. Yes there is a trick to getting around it but then your thermometer isn't sanitary. Finding the covers was sometimes easy and sometimes impossible.I have just never been happy with it. Yes it's easier than the oral... But I found one even better. Try the Temporal Artery Thermometer. You can use that one on a sleeping child!"
4,Worth it if you use it right,"I use this thermometer as my first attempt at getting my daughter's temperature. If she seems warm to me, I will use this thermometer since it is so easy and quick. The underarm takes forever with regular thermometers and she fusses the whole time. And every time I take her temp rectally she poops all over me! You do need to read the directions to make sure you are doing it right. The trick that helped me is to tug downward gently on the ear lobe. If this thermometer reads a temp, I will go on to the next method. Much easier than going through the hassle of rectal or underarm temp just to see that she is fine."
3,Batteries always dead!,I love this thermometer but it seems to go through batteries very quickly. I think that I am going to start taking the batteries out of it when it is not in use. It is really frustrating to grab it to take my baby's temp and have the batteries dead.
3,"Great for adults, but the probe is too big for little ones..","Babies R Us is selling a device that's really great for adults, but the probe is too large to fit the ear of little ones. Our twin boys ears are too small (at 11 months) to get the probe in far enough to take accurate and consistent temperatures. Our peditrician asks specifically for a temporal artery or underarm/rectal temperatue and refuses to recognize ear probe type units because of this problem.The Braun was MUCH more accurate then a few of the other cheapie units on the market out there, like First Years $20 and $30 models (at Target), but more accurate on adults. The Braun on our boys was somewhat consistent, but not accurate enough so we've switched to the Exergen."
1,inaccurate,"I bought this when my son was born thinking it would be easier. It is not b/c it is inaccurate. They tell you to do the temp. 3 times for accuracy. Well, all three times the temperature had a different reading so how do I know which is the correct one? You have to put it in the ear the correct way (which is hard to do). Otherwise your temp. reading is not correct! So, I don't use it and it is a waste b/c it is pricey. I currently use a digital speed read rectal thermometer and I am much happier with it."
1,Don't Buy,This is the worst thermometer!!! We bought this for our son (who is now 4) thinking it would be easy enough to use and better then the old fashion way but we were wrong. When he was 10 days old he wasn't acting himself not eating and seemed like he was hot so we took his temp. but the thermometer said he was fine. We didn't think he was so we called his pediatrician and found out he was running a 103.5 temp!!! Thank God for doctors. I think this thermometer might work IF you can find the right place to put it in the ear. We are just going to go the old fashion way with our next baby due in Dec.
1,Dont Waste the $,"I have been trying to use this by the directions for days now, and cannot get a consistent reading. Its fast, and would be wonderful if it worked, but sadly it is WRONG! I got a measurement of 98.1 and then 100.4 in a matter of 10 seconds apart. And this is on myself, not a wiggly child.The thermometer is going back! Do not waste the $$, but a digi for under the arm and take yourself out for a nice dinner."
3,Good thermometer but...,"This is a good thermometer but with any digital device you have to allow for the variance that all digital devices have, Im sure if you read the specifications it will tell you. Also, rectal temps are good but you can get the exact same result by placing the thermometer in the armpit and holding the babys arm while it is being read. This can be done with a digital thermometer also, the kind the adults us."
1,no good,This thermometer never gives you a correct reading. My child was burning up so we quick grabed it and it read something like 96.5 I tried it again in the other ear and it read 98.7. we deciced to take it rectally and it was 105.3. I don't use this any more. Now it's used to entertain the kids on the changing table with it's buttons & beeps
2,Too big for my baby's ear canal,"This product is great for an adult ear, but does not fit in the ear canal of my 19 month old daughter."
1,Very inacurate themometer,"I bought this thermometer for my new baby girl. However, when I tested it with her the degrees messured ranged wildly within a few minute period, from 97.1 to 99.8 so I could never trust it for fever indication. I'm not sure how anyone uses it without this problem. Maybe there is a wide range of manufacturing defects, as I have no idea how anyone uses the darn thing if all the units work like mine does!"
1,Not reliable...,"I bought this thinking it was going to be the best thing since sliced bread but was proved wrong. I've never had an accurate reading and I'm not saying it was off by a few tenths or even a degree. It's been off by 5-8 degrees. Also, my daughter has had 2 fevers. We've used this thermometer a total of 4 times & I've already replaced the batteries twice. I thought the new batteries would cure the inaccuracy but I was wrong. I've thrown it away and I'm sticking to the rectal temperature as it's the one the Doctor's want anyway."
2,Inaccurate,"This thermometer often proves to be unreliable. On more than one occassion my daughter has had a fever and the thermometer read one thing and then we get to the doctor's office (about 1.5 miles from my house) and their's was completely different. Granted they are taking their's rectally, which is most accurate. One instance our Braun read 102 and at the doctors it was 104! When you are talking about a fever this high there is no room for error. It's happened on more than one occassion...now we are on the search for the ""perfect"" thermometer. I have yet to find it and we are now on thermometer #3."
4,Just ordered......,"I just ordered this. I had bought one about 10 years ago when they first came out. (And what a surprise at the price difference! LOL! They were $100 back then!) Anyhow, I LOVE it. It's still working fine, but it's a bit big and bulky and at this price I may as well get a new one!The thing I want to address is that a lot of people are talking about wrong readings. Well, it has a LOT to do with the ear canal more than the thermometer. My husband and daughter have very narrow canals and the thermometer does not work on them no matter HOW it, or the ear, are positioned. On myself and my two sons, it works just fine. The thermometer has to have a clear opening to fit in right, and to feel the heat of the fever accurately."
1,Nurse says go with a Temporal Artery Thermometer,"Don't bother with these. I am a school nurse, and not just this brand, but MOST brands of ear thermometers are inconsistent, especially when the average person does incorrect positioning in the ear canal. I had to use the ear type for 8 years between Pediatric ICU and school nursing. I got pretty good at getting consistent readings, except on very small ear canals, and those with a lot of wax. We got rid of ours and went with an Exergen TemporalScanner Temporal Artery Thermometer. It takes less time, doesn't require probes, and you can get one at Costco for $30."
2,Burns Batteries,"The only reason I am giving this two stars is because it burns through batteries like crazy. I only used this about 4 times within a month and a half and had to replace the batteries. Now, it's been about a month since I replaced the batteries and I've only used it about 2 times. I went to use it the other day and the batteries are already dead, again. I am very disappointed with it!"
2,I hate this thing.,"I hate this thing, I know it is quick and painless (sometime) but you could take someones temp 10 times and get a totally different reading each time. I don't trust it at all. The only thing I like about it is that it is easy to take the temp of a sleeping child. Lucky my daughter doesn't get sick much, but I plan to get something different."
4,"Took Getting Used to, but Great!","It reads a little low, so I keep that in mind when using it. It is consistent, so I know that my son usually reads 96 degrees so when he is up around 99 or so on this one, I just do a rectal. I would much rather have the ear indicator than do the rectal thermometer frequently! It's saved lots of hassle. It does require the covers, but if I don't mind using the same ones over for the same kid. . .no biggie if you can't get to the store. Someone complained about a battery problem. My son is two and we've never had to replace the batteries. Maybe theirs was defective. I would recommend this product, but with any thermometer, you just have to get used to how it reads and adjust your actions accordingly. My son also thinks its great fun to listen for the beep :)"
2,Ask your pediatrician about ear thermometers,"We bought this and regret it. If you suspect a fever, and call your doctor with a temp from this thermometer, she will ask you to take it again with a more accurate rectal temp. Our hospital gave us a rectal thermometer along with other baby supplies."
3,"Not reliable, but still usefull.","Was hopping it would work well, but....It'll give you five different readings 5 times you try it varying by as much as 1 degree. You can also get surprisingly different results between the ears. By as much as 2-3 degrees if your baby was lying on the side. However it's still useful to do a 5 second sanity check if your baby looks red.If you do not want to stick things into your baby boys rectum, use under arm measurements. (Just mention how you measured it to your doctor & they'll know what it means)"
3,Good but not great; a decent read,"An interesting read with a determined suitor and a strong lady with little belief in her charms. Although books of this sort (brief Regencies) rarely delve deeply into issue and psychological or emotional troubles, this one at least addresses character-making beliefs and actions in some fashion. For me, the problem was that Ardith's self-doubt seemed overwhelming in the face of St. John's complete sincerity and devotion. Moreover, she is so capable that the reader has trouble accepting her opinion of herself. In addition, the rest of her family are pretty much one-note characters, though there are a few minor variations.It had some very lovely moments, but didn't always hold up well. A good percentage of the action seems forced. It drags due to Ardith's stubbornness to believe in St. John."
2,use caution,Please do not get me wrong. if you are one the leave dolls in their boxes. SHE IS A BEAUTY. But i bought her to debox. it is horrible. her legs are about an inch longer than a normal doll so regular clothes DO NOT fit her. Her waist is molded in a permenant arch so she can NEVER STAND STRAIGHT. if you would like to pics of this doll next to a regular barbie please email me at tummiluvsdollies@yahoo.com
1,Paris Hilton Barbie,This Barbie is revolting. I cannot understand why an american idol barbie sings Britney Spears songs when there are plenty of songs by the former American Idol winner that she could sing. No way would I want my 8 year old daughter to relate this doll to how a girl is supposed to be.
2,"""Oops, I bought the wrong toy!""","This doll comes with lots of tiny accessories, which is part of it's appeal for little girls ... but also contains some ""messages"" I would just as soon have left on the store shelf. Her impossibly proportioned torso is permanently contorted in severe scoliosis, leaving her stuck in her ""rock star pose"" and unsuited for any other play. Moreover, when I watch my daughter mimic her stance and sing along with the music (""I'm not so innocent!"") I cringe. Due to her ""deformity"", she's really hard to dress ... so you know who gets stuck with it."
4,"Nice Doll, Just Different","After reading the rest of the reviews in here, I have to say mine is not that negative. I'm an older collector and received this doll as a gift. While it's true it is bent in the position at the waist, it still fits into most of the Fashion Fever outfits. I like the fact that it's different and the karoke machine with cd's is kind of fun, I do wish they had more than one song on it, though. The hair on it is pretty good and I like the brown put in through the blonde. As for the face, I think it's very pretty. The white go-go boots that come with it are retro-great."
5,i love this barbie!!!!!!!!,she looks cool i love american idol i do not like the song 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Barbie? SO UGLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS THE MOST UGLIEST FACE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!! STOP MAKING THIS UGLY DOLL!!! I ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK SHE WAS SO UGLY!!!! AHHHH!!!! NEVER EVER EVER EVER BUY THIS DOLL. THE SONG IS SO INAPPROPITE FOR LITTLE GIRLS!!! BRITTNEY SPEARS IS A BAD ROLE MODEL PERIOD!!! AND HER BEING STUCK IN THAT BENT SHAPE!!!! SO FREAKY!!! HER HAIR IS PUT IN AN UGLY STYLE!!! (...) EACH BARBIE HAS THE SAME MAKE, SMILE, HAIR EVERYTHING!!!!!!!!! AHJHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! SAVE YOUR DAUGHTER AND DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT BUT THIS UGLY DOLL!!!!!!!!! I WOULD OF GAVE IT NEGITIVE ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE."
2,Not real pleased with this barbie.,"My daughter got this barbie for her birthday. I was surprised when I took it out of the box. Her legs are REALLY long. She is not even close to being the same size as other barbies. Also, her waist is molded to be curved. She looks like she is leaning over all of the time. I was thinking that her waist might be bendable, but it is not. The microphone came off of the karioke machine. I have to say that my daughter hasn't played with it much since receiving it."
2,Scoliosis Barbie,"We just bought this for our girl and I can agree that the scoliosis-like Barbie rock star pose is kind of bizarre. I don't recall ever having seen any rock star looking like that and if they were, they were in to see the chiropractor the next day. Probably not a good posture for your growing child to imitate."
1,Freakish,"This doll is disgusting and freakish looking. You'd think with all the controversy over the unrealistic way regular Barbies look, the last thing they'd want to do is come out with such an emaciated looking doll. They could take away the pop clothes and karaoke machine and remarket this as a dolls of the world concentration camp barbie."
3,Song Is Okay,"The song Barbie sings(Oops I Did It Again)has been getting a lot of flac. Personally, I don't see what the huge crisis is. I mean, we all heard the song when it came out. While these days, Britney is not exactly a role model for anyone, when the song came out it was considered approporiate. What's the big deal? It isn't even Britney's voice singing it. Some people just need to get over it!"
2,Not Really good..,Ofcorse barbie won the american idol but i thought she sucked at the singing part she is pretty but if she cant move then i cant groove..get a diffrent doll you have been warned..
1,dull,"The villain idea that in order to simulate nature and calm, you have to superimpose bird songs, water falls noises and so on is simply dreadful. The performances are ok, not impressive but not to toss,the selection is like many others around and it is acceptable. Again the noises are, to me, intolerable. As the other reviewer puts it, good for back drop ""harmonious"" noise, but not for listening to memorable music."
1,LED version is way too big!,"Fits the electrical socket connector okay, but the LED part is larger than the original bulb that it replaces. A very experienced auto mechanic could not get it to go back into the factory hole of the fixture housing on my Mitsubishi 2000 Montero Sport. Would not fit in the front side marker lamp fixture hole nor the front turn signal hole. Making the hole larger ruins the bayonet style locking mechanism of the socket harness and thus becomes prone to rain/water getting into it.A crappy, one size fits all assumption just so they can sell more high-dollar LED bulbs; whether they will fit correctly or not. Buyer beware when ordering anything from this manufacturing company/supplier."
2,Too big,"Bright enough to replace a stock bulb, but too big to in in lens. To make this fit I'd have to shave a lot of plastic from the hole for bulb socket."
1,The Children's Bible on DVD,I was excited when I purchased this DVD for my granddaughters for Christmas. It was the MOST disappointing purchase I have ever made especially since I couldn't return it. I expected it to be Bible stories with animation or actors but it was only in text form!!! Ridiculous. At least I am able to complain. I give it one star for the DVD cover!
1,Not a review - Just a suggestion,"Before springing for these speakers, I would strongly advise reading Steven Burk's review AND ALL THE COMMENTS to it. There's hard data to be found there, not just opinion."
1,don't let them push this phone on you,"i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it. the sound/reception is terrible, you have a hard time hearing the people you're talking to. already i've had problems with the phone ""freezing up."" when turning the phone on/off it will just get hung playing the start/end animation song. also sometimes when just talking on the phone you can turn it off by lightly touching the hang-up button. i orginally went into the store to purchase the samsung p207 put the representative talked me out of it."
2,Should be taken off the market,Why Cingular continues to sell this phone is beyond me? Surely Samsung had to know what a terrible phone they were putting on the market. The main problem is clarity. There is so much distortion that I really have a tough time understanding what people are saying. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!
1,Don't bother,"Volume/speaker is indequate. Phone is NOT as teeny as predecessor 307. ""Many different ringtones"" equates to exactly 11.PATHETIC."
2,Poor quality phone but looks pretty :-),"I scoured the internet and did my homework researching this phone, and found only one person complaining about reception and poor sound quality; other then the review above mine here (maybe no one has bothered to review this phone and post their comments). Well, I am number three now.I was very disappointed this phone sounded the way it did, and had such horrible reception. I own a v400 as well on the cingular network, and I know what and where I should have good reception, and the e317 is not even in the same ball park, it is horrible. I am returning it, and going to give it a second try. If something changes, I will either retract my statements here, or qualify them with more bad news with the replacement e317.Stay tuned..."
2,Bad phone in a nice package...,"It seems strange that Samsung would try so hard to make such a nice phone that includes great features (picture caller ID, dual LCD screens, intuitive menu,etc), and then forget the most important part - the phone. The reception is great (at least that's what the phone indicates), but the sound quality is horrible. I find myself saying ""What?"" every 10-15 seconds. I saw mixed reviews about the e316, so I'm not sure if the poor sound quality is a standard feature, or if I just got a bad apple. I'm definitely returning this one, but not sure what to replace it with."
5,Excellent but for one drawback...,"I have had this phone for 11 months and it was my first cell phone purchase. Now I am renewing my contract and upgrading my phone. I would not be upgrading my phone if it wasn't for the simple fact that:My Samsung E317 does NOT have speakerphone!It is one feature that this phone does not have that would be the most useful for multitasking while conversating.Everything you ever need to know about the phone is listed in above reiews and the product description. I just wanted to point out the fact that there is no speakerphone as I didn't pay attention to that fact until I realized I needed it. I have purchased a Nokia 6102 for the speakerphone and reception quality well known for Nokia phones (as I was told by a Cingular representative).Quick note: I believe that Cingular is the best service, just based on personal experience. Never dropped a call. =)"
3,samsung 317,"Had the Phone on cingular serves for five days now bought the 317 for my self and the samsung 427m for MY Daughter took mine back to day because the sound quality is so bad, had to ask the other person to repeat them selves most of the time. My Daughters 427m sounded great good sound quailty so I traded my 317 for the 427m. the only thing I miss is the front display"
3,Bad sound,"The sound quality is horrible! I purchased my brand new samsung e317 on ebay. I first assumed that the seller had jipped me. Reading these reviews, now I know differently. If I had it to do over again, I would have purchased a different phone."
2,"Not a good phone, better as a camera",This phone has several problems:No speakerphone.Volume control on the outside does not control audio volume; it controls keypad volume -- who needs that?There's no standard jack for downloading photos; you have to buy theirs.
5,Nice...,"This was my first cell phone...and I love it! It's a very cute and compact cell phone! I also love the mini display in the front. I have gotten 3 new cell phones, and all of them have been this one. I just love it!!"
5,"Efficient, useful, high tech phone","This phone is better than the other camera phones out there because it's easy to use, while being very capable. The features it provides are useful. The design is very modern and not too complicated as well. I would recommend it to anyone out there."
3,"Interesting, but...","Please keep in mind that I think three stars means ""Okay"" and that ""okay"" isn't a bad thing.I didn't know anything about Grover Cleveland. After reading this book, I found that I liked him far more than most Presidents. However, I wish that the book went into greater depth or analyzed his life a bit deeper.The author makes various comparisons between Cleveland's sexual behaviors to those of Clinton's, which is fine. But I would have liked to have had other comparisons as well.This is an interesting book and it left me wanting to know more about its subject."
4,Biography of a Great Man,"Grover Cleveland has largely been ignored by historians, which is a pity: not only was he a good president, he was an outstanding human being. In an era where cynical distrust of politicians has become the norm, reading about a man who was trustworthy is refreshing, though one may feel some regret that they don't make 'em like Grover Cleveland anymore. The book itself is not a particularly weighty book, but it does whet the appetite for more information about President Cleveland, and does it in style. A good introduction, in other words - hopefully other scholars will follow Mr. Jeffers in studying this subject."
3,"A bit thin, why are we talking about Clinton?","I liked the story in the book. It painted a very flattering picture of Grover Cleveland. However, I found myself wanting more information about the issues and events of the day to better judge Mr. Cleveland's actions. Most topics were not fully developed. I think there must be more behind the story of a relative unknown reaching the White House in such a short public life.The worst fault in the book is the author's diversions to compare Cleveland to Bill Clinton. This comparison would have been best left to a prologe or epilog, so that it did not detract from the biography. I bought the book to learn about Cleveland, not to have present day political fodder be introduced. Believe me, I'm no fan of Clinton. The author would be more effective as a biographer or as a politco if these topics were separated in the 2nd edition."
2,Weak,"The author appears to have done no original research. He quotes so extensively from earlier biographies that I wish I could read one of them instead. Alas, they all seem to be out of print... If you just want an outline of Cleveland's life and presidency, then I suppose this books is okay, but if you want any insight or analysis, look elsewhere."
3,A Miss and a Hit,"As one who has long admired the life and work of Grover Cleveland and long lamented that he has been largely ignored by modern historians, I welcomed the arrival of this piece. As it turned out, my excitement was tempered by the fact that there is very little new in this work and overall, I found the book thin. The author relies almost entirely on previous compilations and can make no claim to original scholarship. In this sense, it is a much inferior work to the definitive 1932 biography by Allan Nevins. To the extent, however, that Jeffers seeks merely to introduce a mostly unaware public to one of the truly unsung giants of American politics, the book is not without merit."
2,Lovely but Light,Very nice looking book-ends but they are TOO LIGHT! The slightest touch sends them skidding away and leaving my books in an untidy heap. I'd like to adhere a heavy slab of something to the bottom of them.
4,Like it better then the baby bath tubs,"This is a great space saver and dries fast. The slant is not to high so you don't have to worry about the baby falling off, and it is not to low so you can make sure you get enough water in the tub. Seems comfortable for baby. Been using it for 3 months now and no problems. I can't really answer why I gave it 4 stars, i know it is silly but I feel like it could be even better in some way i just can't put my finger on how."
3,Not enough incline,"This product seems to be steady and of a good quality (thus 3 stars), possibly very good for newborns, but it did not work for us. We were looking for a bathing prop when our daughter outgrew her infant tub but before she learned how to sit by herself. At 3 months old, this sling was already somewhat small for her, and, most importantly, its incline is so shallow, that it allows for only a few inches of water around without water getting into baby's ears. As a result, only baby's back is wet from beneath, and that little bit of water gets cold within minutes. In addition, baby's legs are up in the air (no fun ""splashing""). It could have work if we continually pour water on her belly, but I didn't find that practical."
4,Fold N Store,This was also ordered on suggestion from the yahoo answers site when I was looking for a baby tub. This is very good although I haven't gotten as much use out of it as the baby foam. This works well in the bath if the bath is very shallow. It does not work in the sink as it is too big for most sinks. Overall the quality is good and I suggest this and the green baby bath foam --you could prop this on top of the foam. Our baby has only used this a couple of time but it is fairly practical and since it is mesh it dries quickly.
2,Only for newborns,"This is great for the first 30-60 days with a new baby, but good for the garbage after that. It gets moldy fast, and a larger baby will flip right out. I would say it's likely there is something better, but for the price it's good."
2,Not sure of the benefit...,"When I had my last child almost 9 years ago, I had something similar to this that I loved. I purchased this one, thinking it would be similar. I was wrong. I can't pinpoint the difference since it hs been so long, but this doesn't seem to have any benefit. It doesn't fit in the infant tub very well at all, and seems incredibly ""tight"", which makes it difficult to place the baby on."
3,Great if you're short on space,Our current housing is small so we purchased this instead of a infant tub. I like it because it dries quickly and thoroughly unlike the big sponge ones. We also like it because instead of the infant laying flat he is in a reclined position that allows him to see more and he loves being able to kick his feet in the water you can't do that with the sponges. This one also folds for storage making it even smaller. The only thing I would change would be making the mesh with a little more give to cradle the infant a little more and help with the sliding issue (when your baby kicks and moves around they slide down a little) my boy is over 10lbs now and the mesh still doesn't give much and stays straight instead of cradling him.
3,Noisy live recordings of some tracks!!!,"There are some beautiful tracks on this CD, but some are live recordings which I find quite annoying because the sound of sporadic applause throughout a track interferes with the music itself. Had I known that, I would not have bought this CD for the simple reason that as a general rule I stay away from live recordings. The sample clips on Amazon postings leave out these noisy parts and if somewhere they disclose that some tracks are live recording, I must have missed it.If the noise does not bother you, then this is a CD worth having."
3,Adequate...,"This map is adequate, but unlike with other IL counties, this map does not include the townships. That would be very helpful to me for business (insurance) purposes."
4,Does what it says,We bought this because hubby is a double-lung transplant patient and measures his peak flows multiple times a day. This measures the peak flows just like the manual gizmo and it also gives you the volume (unlike the manual gadget). It comes with multiple mouthpieces and a case. Good value and works as expected.
2,seems to measure speed not volume,"This is my first experience with a peak flow meter so I can't compare it to anything else. My understanding is that it is a device to measure total lung capacity, but the simplistic design only seems to measure the max speed of air, not volume. Following the instructions exactly while feeling fine, my PEF value is well below what it should be, but if I just give a quick fast blow, it is well above. It seems to me that it could measure how powerful a sneeze you can produce, but not the volume of air your lungs can process at a given time. I called Microlife to be sure I was doing it correctly before returning it, and they confirmed my technique was correct."
4,Reasonably reiable instruement,I can't really judge the accuracy of this device since I do not have a reliable standard available to compare it to. But the readings seem reasonable and correlate well with my subjective feelings of congestion or free breathing. I have taken more than 100 readings and they make an interesting plot. The only reason for less than 5 stars is the occasionally there is flacky reading.
3,problems,"1. Somehow 7 out of 10 times this device can't record properly. For example, after my son blows in it, it shows 200 and the FEV but then when it's ready for the next blow, instead of zero, it shows Hi. From there, my son's previous reading and all the following attempts will be recorded as Hi instead of any numbers. When it shows Hi, I have to turn it off, and then turn it on again until it shows zero. 2. I didn't purchase the program to analyze the readings but didn't realize without the software I can't transfer the data to my computer either. For the price of this device, I think Microlife should allow users to download data to the computer. 3. the interval between different readings is too short. It makes reading previous records difficult and manually recording previous readings impossible."
4,Good Health,Like having this device in my home for convience so I can monitor my asthma more closely that just when visiting the doctor. Would recommend.
5,This device is great!,"I have an MD, that will diagnose everyone around with asthma. This device produced the graphs which were enough for me to show that MD that this is not the case! and additionally, it has put my mind to rest..."
2,More disappointing after a year,"The longer I have had this item the less accurate it has become; this is in comparison to two other meters provided by physicians.The software is quite primitive and there has never been an effort by the manufacturer to improve it. Printing options are almost useless. If you need an update, or just want to check, you have to email them a request to see if you need it and then have them send it to you. Never have had a successful download with their software.Recently purchased a new Mac computer and learned that there is not a Mac software version. The program also does not work with Window emulation programs for Mac or any other operating system, such a Linux.Don't recommend for purchase."
1,Crude device - IMPOSSIBLE SOFTWARE,"FIRST, note that the software available for this device is WINDOWS 98!!! Insane! People with Windows XP will experience crashes and Vista and Windows 7 users just have no access at all.The device itself is rudimentary and cheaply made. The rubberized side panels have a gummy-tacky feel which is, well, creepy. I'll update on durability and accuracy after more experience."
1,Not sensitive enough to register any reading for someone with emphysema.,I purchased this item to help determine how well a person with emphysema was breathing and although I could easily register a reading using it the patient could not budge it. When I called the manufacture they could provide no help or alternate item. Patient was tested in a breathing chamber and was at 17% anticipated capacity therefor the need for the meter.
5,"Fast, accurate, easy to use, and came with all necessary accessories","Pros:* Light* Quick reading times* Lots of functionality* Comes with extra mouthpieces, USB cable, nice carrying case, and moreCons:* Seems to forget the date and time settings if you remove the batteries even for a moment. Setting these requires a toothpick or paper clip. Not a big deal.* Beep is a little loud and long"
2,MicroLife PF100 Peak Meter and Software,The Unit is bulky and the USB connection is placed under a plastic cover that must be removed before the unit can be attached to the computer for downloading. The software does not provide a way to eliminate errant data. Consider the nSpire Health Piko-1 and PikoNet software as an alternative.
4,it works...,"A good product. The mouthpiece part is not a secure fit, so one needs either to keep it oriented correctly, or possibly ""tighten"" with a layer of tape. Othewise it works as advertised"
4,I think it's helpful...,"I got this for my husband who was recently diagnosed with COPD. The instruction manual didn't really give a clear guideline as to what his target number, especially for the FEV1, should be. I think it's because we are both new to this that I am not sure what he is aiming for. I also didn't understand how it could give him a ""green"" when it doesn't know if you are a male/female, age, etc. I also thought the mouthpiece came off much too easily. All that being said, I think it is going to be quite useful once my husband and I meet with the doctor again and get some guidelines from him on this device. I love that it stores 240 readings. I would recommend this device to someone else, as long as they were going to use it in conjuction with a trained person's direction."
3,It's ok..,"I'm not quite sure how accurate this is yet. I haven't been able to compare it to the one at my doctor's office. Just doing it myself, and knowing my 'usual' numbers, I would say it is way off. But, like I said, haven't had a chance to compare yet."
4,Works good,"Bought this for my eight year old son with asthma. We kept going through the plastic cheep ones and the numbers would all rub off so we decided to go digital. He loves it, and it makes it easier to not have to write down his numbers all the time. we also bought the software package, which is nice. The problem with the peak flow meter is that it can only be for ONE user. You can not differentiate between two people. Our daughter also needs to use a peak flow, but even though this one comes with different colored mouthpieces, their scores cannot be separated. Overall we are happy with it. We plan to buy our daughter one as well - It's just too bad they didn't make it multi-user."
1,Not easy to figure out,"Maybe I'm a dummy, however, I am 70 years old and tech smart. Couldn't figure this gadget out at all. Amazon's price is good if you do decide to try."
4,Pretty good product with fair price,Worked well for my kids who abuse the key board. No issues. My iMac is dead so the keyboard is no longer in use.
2,Why switch keys around?,"everything is good with the keyboard, keys responsive - a little to 'springy' for me.2 usb plugs you need to plug into the computer - then you get 3 usb ports on the keyboard. one directly above 11/12 number keys.* THE BIG GRIPE - moving the cap locks key to bottom right of keyboard (IN BETWEEN option and control!) and having another control key where caps lock normally is. ?!?!?!? How about keeping the keys where we're used to them. As a lefty, i NEED to access the option/control keys on the right.... i don't need an extra key in the middle to confuse me.it coulda been a contender...."
5,Very pleased w/ all Twinings decaf teas,We've been drinking Twinings decaf teas for a while now & this one is new to us. Very pleased with it -- lighter in flavor than Earl Grey -- most enjoyable in the afternoons.
4,Good Stuff!,"I really like this flavor! I usually buy it in ""leaded"" but im trying to cut all caffiene. This is delicious! I also highly recommend Irish Breakfast Tea! Thats my fave, and its the strongest Twinings makes other than Lapsang Souchong."
2,Boring!,I recently ordered some delicious earl grey from Amazon and was excited to try the lady grey. Based on the description and reviews I was expecting some fruit flavor. This tea is no better than plain tea. No fruit or other flavors were discernable and I was extremely disappointed. As a mild regular tea it would have received four stars but as a lady grey it is undrinkable. Wasted my money as this only came in a six pack.
4,Pleasant,"A very pleasant mild tea with just a hint of bergamot and citrus. Nothing too overpowering. It's so hard to find good flavors in decaf version, so I was pleased to find this."
4,Peaceful,"Good music and arrangements. Some are peaceful, and some you want to kick up your hills. Song No. 13 is very beautiful."
2,Not for a lay person,"May be people who have gone to a seminary can understand the book but it does not seem to be written for lay people who don't know anything about doctrine. I have read two of Leane Payne's books and both have benefited me a lot so I've had so much expectation about the book but have been very disappointed at this book. The book is too boring may be due to hard to understand. So, I have stopped after forcing my self to read up to one third of the book. I wouldn't recommend this book especially for those who are not ministers."
1,Got the wrong item,"I ordered this necklace but I was sent the matching bracelet instead. So I can't comment on the necklace. The color of the matching bracelet isn't as blue as the picture shows, it's more of a greenish-blue."
1,DID NOT SHIP,This item did not ship whatsoever along with the matching bracelet. I got the earrings alone. I bet it's a great product but I cannot say having not received it.
1,Wrong Item Sent,"Got a tiger eye necklace instead of turquoise, and too late to return since shipped all the way to Lagos!"
3,"Works well, lasts just under 2 years","The Intermatic 44 Watt Lighting Timer/Transformer came with an outdoor lighting kit purchased in August 2009. The device worked well. It came with 4 pins to add to the timer, 2 on and 2 off. So you could have the lights come on at dusk, shut off at 11PM, then come back on at 4AM and shut off at 7AM if you were so inclined.The timer emits a noticable buzzing sound when plugged in. I've read around that this can be common and is a part of metal plates inside vibrating, but is typical if the plates weren't secured properly inside.The timer decided to die this month after nearly completing 2 years. I have read that this can also be common but is on the lower end of the life expectancy.I can only give 3 stars because it made a lot of noise and didn't last 2 years. Other than that it performed as described."
1,Fraud,This bit of tripe is nothing more than here old travelogues with new wrap arounds. She doesn't even include the actual sites in the movie. This is just an effort to make a quick buck without actually doing anything. I am supprised Dan Brown gave her permission to use the name of the book in the title.
2,Couldn't get into it....,I read this book because I'm a big fan of the Kay Scarpetta novels and this was supposed to be along the same line. I found the characters to be boring and not well developed and the story too slow.
2,Do not expect anything great,"I usually never write reviews. Seldom will I take the time to contribute to the internet's ecosphere of knowledge. Ironically though, I heavily rely on user reviews when selecting my next fix. ""Killer Instinct"" looked very promising; 4 1/2 star average, good price, charismatic reviews; I bought it 3 days ago and just finished it 30 minutes ago. With that being said, let the review begin:After the first few chapters,it was impossible for me to read the book continuously. At first, I knocked off about 20% of the book. The beginning appeared promising. The rest is not so. Do not expect a Red Dragon-esque effect after reading this book. Also, this book is FILLED with introspective thoughts and questions by the protagonist. Personally, when that is overdone, I get bored.I took 10 minutes of my night to write this review for others like me.I give this book 2 stars because I liked the vocabulary the author uses."
4,Adorable,"Our daughter loves Bibble and loves to scare Daddy with it's ""Nighty, Nighty"" blurt as Bibbles sees glow. It later comes back to snore to indicate it's sleeping. She still plays with it 2 year later."
5,Wonderful!!,I purchased this for my niece but my daughter saw it while I was wrapping it and she started going crazy. She loved the barbie movies and often talks about Bibble so I thought it would be a great gift for my niece but after the way my daughter reacted I put it away for Christmas for her. She talked about Bibble for the rest of the night and asked a few times where Bibble had gone. I got a better deal though I purchased it in the clearance section at Walmart for just $9! But if you have a girl you are shopping for that loves the Barbie movies Bibble is goint to be great!!!
5,Need More of These Shows!,"I believe the public broadcasting system should release entire episodes of the original ZOOM series from 1972 - 1976.I also would like the television industry to consider a network channel dedicated to just 70s Childrens' programming ( The Magic Garden, New Zoo Revue, Electric Company, Romparoom, Kid Power (Wee Pals)etc. Boomerang and TVLand are a good start but are missing this scope in particular. These shows are a refreshing look-back to when you could be an aware, thinking individual and not get crammed with reality show spin-offs."
2,1972 film about witches,"A newspaper photographer and his girlfriend are traveling through the mountains on an assignment to photograph a legendary haunted peak. Stopping at a castle near the mountain to rest for the evening, they discover that not all is as it seems. The castle is the home of a coven of witches that call the peak their own and wish to keep any strangers away from their activities."
3,Not Disney,"This animated version of the Victor Hugo story is only fair, but be warned it is not the Disney Version, despite attempts on the cover art to make it appear so.UPDATE: Since I wrote this original review, Amazon.com has added the disclaimer to the title listing so that we all know it is not Disney."
1,CHICKEN AND RIB RUB,i am very unhappy with this product. when i received this product it was very hard i had to stir it up with a knife to get it to come out ofthe container. i will never order this on line again. i would also like my money back
3,Blah,"Ok. I was a huge fan of the first CD and the second album was not too bad. After that, the band seems to have lost something. I miss the Country Rock influences of Jim Fish on guitar in particular. Plus his background vocals seem better in my opinion. They just didn't seem the same with out him. I just couldn't get into this album. It was the last Henry Paul Band album I listened to!"
3,Similar to Tears of the Sun,This movie reminded me of Tears of the Sun with Bruce Willis....but in French. Very entertaining movie with good acting.
5,Mostly in English! Only subtitle when speaking native languages. Realistic,"This movie is more realistic than most. It shows the hardship special operations forces go through. Most Hollywood movies over glamorize special operations. In most Hollywood movies, they make it look like the heros parachute in, kill the bad guys, rescue the princess, and go home for a cold beer with little or no casualties. This movie is more realistic. It shows what can go wrong on a carefully planned operation, and the sheer guts and determination it takes to make an operation successful."
4,Not a bad movie.,"This was an honest attempt at making a movie that was not all flash, bang. And there were some very nice moments. The movie gave the actors a vehicle to, at times, give some very fine performances."
4,Special Forces Movie,"This was a surprisingly well made movie. Often times these types of films are hastily made and low budget. This film was well acted and most of the dialogue was in fact in english. Although I am not well-versed in French equipment and tactics, it seemed fairly authentic. Diane Kruger is always pleasant to watch."
2,Unrealistic,"Who crosses a mountain range in a raging blizard with no winter weather gear in a few days and lives to tell about it, apparently most of the main characters in this film. Aside from that nonsense this film wasn't bad to watch with your finger on the fast forward button. Want to see a more realistic special forces film watch Act of Valor."
5,Latin's Not So Tough! Level Four Short Set,This set of books came very quickly. The best part for our daughter was the set of vocabulary cards. Weare putting them in alphabetical order so individual words are easier to find.
5,Best album of 2004,"This album is the best album of the year....i know that sounds like way too brash a statement but The Shore are making music that doesn't sound like what other people are doing right now. All the Verve/Coldplay/et al comparisons are fine but make no mistake that this band is doing something different, original and fun. From song 1 to 10 there is no skip needed....most albums today have 3 or 4 songs max that you really want to listen to again and again but you can listen the entire album all the way through without fighting the urge to hit the skip button...do yourself a favor and give this band a chance, if you are a fan of rock music this is well worth your time and money."
5,"Great Sound, Great Vocals","I just saw this band play a gig, they blew me away. I know there are a lot of comparisons to other bands etc. I didn't hear it. Personally, I think they have their own sound and it's good."
4,turning your orbit around,"i'm a big fan of bands like, coldplay, the verve, oasis, the beatles and many more. so when i read in a magazine that these guys we're similar to the Verve i immeadiatly wanted to listen. unfortunatley searching for the band on the internet was pretty bleak. i couldn't find anything, so when i was in the vancouver Virgin Records and by chance saw this album i took it to one of the listening stations. As soon as i got to Waiting For The Sun i was hooked. i bought the cd and never looked back. it's nice to have something refreshing in the music industry again."
4,Domestic band with a foreign sound,"One listen and you'll realize that Ben Ashley's voice is pretty much a dead ringer for Richard Ashcroft. Their sound is actually pretty close to the Verve. Each track overflows with sincerity and passion typical of Britpop acts. I really do give them proper dues for the composition of this album. The orchestration and arrangment is excellent for a brand new band. Ben's voice carries most of these tracks with a somewhat painful and drawl style of singing. His range is also shown to be impressive on tracks like ""Hold On"" and ""Firefly"". This album is definitely for Britpop fans and for anyone who appreciates the earnest and wistful nature of each song. I only give it 4 out of 5 because while everything is very impressive the lyrics themselves come off as typical and cliche at times. That shouldn't hinder the desire to sing along though, and trust me you will."
4,Bialetti Venus 4-Cup,"So far, it works fine. My housemate accidentally ran it dry and burned a pot, but other than some funky discoloration of the steel, it is intact, including the handle, which others have had problems with. Perhaps that was a design issue they have since changed? I am also very good about not using the handle to screw and unscrew the parts.p.s.: I liked Davi Grant's hose idea, although I haven't tried it yet."
3,This is a good percolator with some limitations,"It is good one. But, we always get some coffee bean in the coffee. I have tried using coarsely ground powder, but the result is the same. The gasket appears very delicate. Bit difficult to clean."
2,Disappointed,Originally pot worked great. I was excited to find a small stainless steel espresso stovetop....they can be hard to find. Within a week it consistently brews irregularly. At first making a very concentrated espresso which i must pour out for it to somehow continue brewing and then it leaks where it twists together. It seems that the rubber gasket is not a tight fit. Thats the whole reason I needed a new pot to begin with because I couldn't get get a replacement gasket to fit my old pot. Total bummer!
5,Another Great Bialetti Stovetop Moka/Espresso Maker,"I was just about ready to buy an aluminum Bialetti when I read a review about the connection to Alzheimers and decided this was only about five dollars more and it is more attractive. I figured as long as it was a Bialetti, I couldn't go wrong. If you want espresso at home, there is really no reason to fork over major dough when just a few more minutes and little more time, you get the same thing. The Bialetti(s) are a true hidden Italian treasure. If you like strong, delicious espresso this is great. I am looking forward to trying other blends of coffee with this. I originally tried this with Starbuck's Caffe Verona which is a Bold blend. I recalled the first espresso I ever had at Starbucks and it tasted exactly the same. Some people would disagree, but there is no debate that this is at the very worst, very, very similar to the best possible espresso. If you want great espresso and a good looking moka pot this is great."
5,"fast, easy and cute.","This little espresso maker is easy to use, cleans up nicely and makes a good cup o' jo! My review is for the 4cup version and keep in mind that the cup sizes are meant to be those tiny little italian espresso cups. I actually use the whole serving for one large latte. If I fill the bottom above the steam release valve (the specified fill line) I can get enough coffee for my latte and a small cup for my husband. If purchasing again, I would get the 6 or 8 cup (if available) just so that I don't have to make multiple brews for company.All-in-all, I love it! It is easy to clean, looks sharp, and is functioning properly after a month or two of everyday use."
1,really poorly conceived,"this was a huge disappointment. I paid 30 dollars for something that was supposed to work ON THE STOVE TOP and yet the sixth or seventh time i used it the handle melted and came off in my hand, filling the kitchen with a toxic, horribly smelling smoke. And no, the fire wasn't too strong. Who do I see to get my money back????"
5,Good,"We got the 4 cup Bialetti Venus Percolator for making espresso. While it does the job, it was much smaller than I thought it would be. I like the stainless steel. Maybe in the future we will upgrade to a larger one."
4,"Great product, great coffee","After about a month, I'm very happy with this purchase. I originally bought it to have something small for my boyfriend's apartment, but was hoping to re-create the coffee when I lived in Spain. It worked so well on both counts that I bought another (the aluminum version) for my own apartment. I still have a regular American drip coffee maker for when I want several cups of coffee or have guests, but use this most of the time. I can't really detect any difference in taste between the stainless steel and the aluminum, although I have to be much more careful to wash and dry immediately the aluminum."
2,Gross,"I'm not sure what the other negative reviewers are talking about. It's sturdy, well-made, heat-resistant, I had no problems with jamming or gaskets or anything else. And 4 cups is the perfect amount for a stovetop coffee maker. That's what the two stars are for. The problem I have is with the upper compartment that the coffee pours into. The bottom of it curves downward toward the sides into a thin crevice which is IMPOSSIBLE to clean. After 2 months this thing is so gross I'll probably just throw it away. I love Bialetti and every other product I've had by them, and I've gone through multiple Mokas and I know how to use them. I just can't understand why they would shape the inside of this one differently. I'll be getting another Moka Express and I would suggest the same to anyone else."
5,What a cup of coffee!,"When our espresso maker went down, it was a leap of faith to try a stove-top Bialetti at a friends suggestion. No regrets. Making coffee with a Bialetti requires some patience when compared to an espresso machine, but you cannot argue with the results."
4,Love my coffee maker!,"Looks great, coffee tastes great, easy to use! My only little issue is that it already has the tiniest of rust spots inside the bottom chamber. I usually am very conscientious about emptying the leftover water once it cools down but there was 1-2 times that I forgot for a couple of hours. I hope it doesn't get worse and that I can get a couple years of use out of it."
3,Penthouse is on the right track,"There are problems with this feature. First off, there are only three girls: Tera Patrick, Sunny Leone, and Kyla Cole. Secondly, they don't push the boundries equally among the different scenes. Kyla's solo scenes were dissapointing in the fact that she never breaks the harder boundry, even once for a finale --she's all tease and no payoff, wich is very tame in comparison to Tera and Sunny's. But the positives far outweight the negetives. Sunny Leone is so damn hot and bothered in her solo scenes that she breaks into the harder stuff quite often amid teasing. The girl-girl scenes are a little bit of a let down in comparision, although the first one with Kyla and Sunny has some great moments. It's only a small complaint. Now we just need to combine this one with ""Dear Diary""..."
5,Simply superb erotica blaster,This is the first ever penthouse video I purchased and I am very impressed about it. Sunney is at her best. She is just too hot all through. Although the other two have done thir magic but sunney is just mind blowing.
3,PENTHOUSE HAS A HIT WITH THIS DVD 3.5/5,"Pets In Paradise(Vol.1) is solid. First off the women featured in this DVD all are beautiful and each one has a different look,not just one variety(like all blondes,etc..)and each woman does a good job showing that they are having a good time posing and enjoying themselves. Secondly if your a fan of Pet Of The Year 2003(Ms. Sunny Leone)than you will be happy to see her. I just wish Sunny's solo scenes had the heat the solo scenes that were in (Pet Of The Year 2000 Winner and 2002 Winner) and not so tame.I do however recommend Pets In Paradise over Pet Of The Year 2003 Playoff and P.O.T.Y 2003 Winner which were both disappointing."
3,A Great DVD For Sunny Leone Fans=3.5/5,"This DVD delivers in all departments. The DVD has lush settings,beautiful women and still pushes the envelope in a Penthouse classy way. Most notable are Sunny Leone(PET FOR 2003) and Kyla Cole who look breathtaking, and even though I'm not into Tera Patrick,she does look the best I've ever seen her before. In addition Pets In Paradise was filmed in Costa Rica using a high quality Panavision camera and is great DVD quality,so get this instead of Pets In Paradise 2 and you will be happy!"
4,Wonderful framework for thinking about cultural differences,A must-read for anyone interested in the subject area.The new and revised content also relate Hofstede's original groundbreaking research to the more recent work of other renowned scholars in the field (such as Ronald Inglehart of the Univ of Michigan and the World Values Survery). These links make his work even more compelling and make you start to think that we may be inching closer to a more universally agreed upon framework for thinking about cultural differences.
3,It's good. For a textbook.,"I'm a grad student working on an international MBA and this was one of our required texts. I admit to being rather intimidated by all of the buzzwords in it when I first got the book, but after sitting down and actually churning through it, it's not bad at all. It didn't exactly drastically alter my perspective with regards to international/intercultural communications, but it definitely provided some 'hmmm... neat' points to think on.If it wasn't a required book, I'd pass it by. Buy it used - that's my advice."
4,good sequel,"No sooner do I search out this book in a used book store, do they finally reprint it! This book , while not as good as the first, is quite enjoyable. I hate Marshak and Culbreath, but they only edited this book and wrote one story. The story ""Surprise"" by Nichelle Nichols is a nice change of pace from space battles. Another good anthology"
5,Quality Bit Set,I made my first raised panel door with this set and would highly recommend it. It is a pro. set and comes with easy directions and video. I will be doing my whole kitchen over so I needed a good set!
5,Go Freud!!,"What else would you expect but quality? This is my first time making a set of doors. They came out perfect. The setup is easy if you follow the instruction video or the paper they give you. I found it a must, to make a router table sled for doing the rails. I bought the phenolic sheet and a grizzly clamp off of Amazon. They got delivered fast and made it a lot easier. It prevents the back of the wood from blowing out. Make sure to check the speeds on your router. The back cutter feature makes the set even nicer."
4,Freud door set,"I have had limited use so far, made two small doors, and amazed at the quality of the cuts. No sanding needed. I am disappointed with the video, you need an Apple download to play, which would take 4 hours on my dial up connection."
5,Nothing lasts forever,But this one comes close. I hate running out of ink and once I figured out how I could use just the black it seemed I got more mileage out of the cartridges. My Brother is somewhat antiquated when compared to other MFC's but it has given me very few problems. But I digress; the brother ink cartridges do a tremendous job.
5,Ink Cartridge,Great Toners is a wonderful company. They care about their ratings and respond promptly to any communication. I highly recommend this company and will use them in the future for all my ink needs.
4,It's ink. It works fine.,"This is the ""official"" black ink for a range of Brother printers. It works fine, but doesn't last all that long. I barely use my MFC-440CN to print, though - I use it much more often as a fax machine (sending) and as a scanner, so I don't really mind."
5,Ink,"I've tried other brands that were supposed to be compatible, but they printed horribly. If you have a Brother Printer/Fax/Copier the only way to go is with Brother Ink."
5,Quality,All ink cartidges are not the same. I believe in using a high quality ink cartridge in my high quality Brother multi-function center.
4,Christmas gift,This is what my granddaughter has requested for Christmas. She is in Vet school & uses alot of ink for her papers.
1,i paid for brother ink original and they sended me difererent ink no original,1 of: Brother LC51BK Black Ink CartridgeSold by: Abacus24-7 (seller profile)when i saw this ink with that price waas really incredible for $5.98 i think this is the greate price and when they ship me my product i got a compatible ink BROTHER they never said that they say: 1 of: Brother LC51BK Black Ink CartridgeSold by: Abacus24-7IM VERY DESAPOINTED.CHECK EVERY ORDER YOU BUY GUYS . THANK YOU FOR THIS SPACE FOR YOUR COSTUMER'S.
1,A little tricked and don't like it!,"I bought this toner in a 'package' deal with my fax...problem is that I was ripped off by over $8.00 shipping that was separate from the free shipping I got for my fax. I'm not happy about this and I recommend NOT buying the toner and fax together...they'll rip you off with the shipping cost...over $8.00 to ship a toner that weighs a few ounces, Amazon should be ashamed and not let this happen!"
4,As good as Brother's at about 1/10th of the cost !,"I ordered a compatible Brother MFC 3360C LC-51 black ink cartridge. I have been completely satisfied. The cost was about 1/10th of the Brother black ink cartridge from Office Depot. When I tried to take back the Brother cartridge because it did not last for 10 pages, Office Depot said they take back no cartridges, I would have to take it up with Brother. They said I wouldn't have any luck, but I could try. I went on line and bought 3 compatible black cartridges on Amazon and they work great."
3,A great antenna,I am grateful to be able to have an antenna as mine broke off and I didn't want to buy a new phone. I bought one antenna and the plastic came off the metal part where it screws into the phone. I returned it for another one and within a week had the same result. I took some supper glue and glued it on carefully so as to not damage the antenna part. It has worked great so far. I just think that it would be nice if the factory would have glued it better.
2,too big to fit in,"Very good light, but it is a little bit big, won't fit in my 06 odyssey, so had to return it."
2,nice and bright but won't fit,"I plugged the bulb into the wire harness and the bulb is very bright. I think the white led bulb is brighter than this red led bulb. Also, be aware, your car dashboard will lite a really irritating ""light out"" indicator if you use this bulb. But the biggest problem is that this bulb will not fit my Honda Accord. It's way too big. Unless you want to butcher your Honda Accord tail light housing, don't buy it. I don't know if this led bulb will fit / or not fit other cars. I think the manufacturer should a list of cars known to fit this bulb."
1,Way too big! Won't fit!,"This bulb is way too big, amazon SHOULD describe its exact size so one could be aware that is so big that it WONT fit the housing of a taillight. I was unable to return it since I'm not in the USA so a BIG loss of money for me."
4,Great product but none of my cats would eat it :(.,"When I decided to give my cats canned food I tried this excellent canned food but none of my four cats cared for it. The food would sit there and they would sniff it and turn their noses. I gave it four stars because the ingredients are excellent. Three of my cats liked the wellness canned food, and the last one only likes dry food."
3,"Great food, very late delivery","I have a diabetic cat and this food is awesome. I also thought, how nice to have it delivered to my house for close to the same costs as I was paying in a very smelly pet store. BUT my main complaint not about amazon but that this is coming from another associated company...it did NOT arrive during the estimated time but 5 days later than that. In all total from order to delivery it took 17 days to receive my order!!! Had I know that I would have either ordered MUCH earlier or not at all! The final complaint is that this does not qualify for free shipping even thought the cost is over 25 dollars. Maybe again because it is an affliated company or due to the weight. This too made my wait and the costs to wait less appealing."
1,elmos great outdoors,loses my 16 month old daughter's interest in the first 3 minutes. Would not recommend.
2,My least favorite....,"My kids really love Elmo and his DVD's, but this one is a little scarey. Some of the animals, and even some of the stormy weather scenes are a little intense for sensitive viewers. There are definitely better Elmo DVD""s out there."
4,nice but operatic,"This is a nice collection of Bernstein miscellany. Note however that the West Side Story, On the Town, and Candide are the ""operatic"" versions, with Te Kanawa and Carreras, Von Stade and Hampson, and Jerry Hadley, respectively. Bernstein conducts WSS and Candide and Tilson Thomas OTT. The surprise is the bits from Wonderful Town, which was recorded on JAY, not DG like the others. Featuring Ron Raines and Rebecca Luker, it's probably the most authentically ""Broadway"" of this set."
4,don't be fooled by negative reviews...,"most of the negative reviews for this product result from the fact that it's basically a repackaged version of the more expensive edition that was released previously. despite being in full screen (it was shot in widescreen, but they dont' show up on dvd in 16X9 until season 5) and not having much in the way of bonus features, this is an excellent DVD set. the X-files is one of the best shows that has been on TV and the second season is a dramatic improvement over the hit-and-miss first season (but not as good as season 4, which is one of the strongest seasons)."
3,Please be clear that the special features are missing,"I bought the First Season collectors' edition, but then I saw that there was a cheaper second season set, so I read some reviews and various people said it contained the same content, and the description did not say much about it. When it arrived however, I was dissappointed.I love the X-Files, but they should be more clear that the DVDs do not contain the special features found on the Collector's Edition, as this is part of the lower price. I suppose this is just me being nerdy, but I'd rather have a complete set to cherish for a lifetime. So I'll pay more for the special features, I just baby the box."
4,does what it needs to,"i changed two bulbs with this. all i can say it that it worked both times, but the second time it came unscrewed while i was unscrewing the bulb. no big deal just took it off the bulb and screwed it on again. if you need to change bulbs that are too high and don't want to spend too much money i recommend this product"
2,Not so good,"I've only tried to use this once, and didn't have much success. After reading other reviews I see I am in mixed company."
3,Bring along a partner to use this,"This is a nice little and inexpensive product, but it's difficult to use in real life. I was trying to change tight recessed bulbs on my porch and they were pretty hard to navigate with this. If you are relatively unhandy like me, it's a good idea to have a partner whose job it is to catch the bulbs that fall during the process when the suction releases. That way you will break fewer than I obviously have."
3,Not for use with frosted bulbs,Pro: universal attachment - works with many different extension polesCon: the suction cup will not work for frosted bulbs
1,A Portrait?,"Visconti films are NOT mass media and should not be treated as such. I feel strongly if one cannot grasp this masters work with a level of sophistication required for one of Visconti's standing, let it alone............please. This is a portrait but not one I want to look at."
5,"I never liked ""grunge"".","I never liked ""grunge"" or ""alt-rock"" , but this film should be required viewing 'cause it is so DAMNED FUNNY! The whole ""grunge"" fad was funny back in the early 90's but seeing all of these pretentious twits talk about how cool they are is pure comedy. Eddie of Pearl Jam steals the show with his pretentious commentary on the nature of fame and fads. This film should be shown to young teens as a warning against jumping on to silly fads! Oh, did I mention that 90% of the music in this film is JUNK?"
2,Boring overated documentery,"If you're a fan of that genre of ""music,"" I guess this movie is for you. For me, it was nothing more than a cure for my insomnia.Blech!"
2,Birken's inexperience shows,"It is evident that this is the first book from a man with another profession. He seems to follow some obvious and tiresome formulas. Every character, upon each new meeting, has his clothing described in detail.Also, though this book is from the ""perspective"" of Erin, the female protagonist, it is clearly written by a man with a titillating fascination for how a woman behaves alone in her own hotel room, or how a sexually aggressive woman would seduce a hesitant man.I do admit, though, that the story flowed well enough, and I was curious enough to keep reading. I'm not sorry I read it, but it's clearly not any great literature. There is clearly better medical fiction out there."
2,Fairly lame piece of work,"What lurks in the mind of a doc who can only seem to write novels about medical people killing patients, mostly little kids, and breaking every moral law imaginable to hide what they did?I don't know, but in this case it certainly isn't a commanding knowledge of how to write a believable, or even interesting, mystery thriller.Looking at his other novels' subject matter just gives me the creeps. I think I'll pass.I think Dr. Birken should stick to the medical job, unless of course he puts as much effort into his cases as he does his novels. He could have at least made his characters a bit more believable. I think I'll give my copy of this one away.I gave this two stars because it took some gutts to actually publish this book so that other people could read it."
5,Marvelous and magical!,"FOOL FOR LOVE was a fabulous book! It's been a long time since I've met characters I liked as well as Henrietta, Darby, Josie, and Anabel. And Eloisa James's writing is absolutely exquisite. When you couple that with her deft touch for characterization, her tender empathy for the human condition and all of its lovable absurdities, her astonishing historical accuracy, and her musical ear for dialogue, well, you have a true gem of a book. I laughed out loud, I cried, and when I turned the last page, I sighed with absolute and utter satisfaction. Eloisa James is truly one of the brightest lights of the historical romance genre and I look forward to watching her shine for years to come!"
1,ufo tube,"This tube does NOT spin. We tried this tube with 2,3 & 4 people- varying the size , weight & placement of them trying to get this thing to work! It will turn VERY slowly with 2 people of identical size, but by no means does it spin. We spent about 6 hours on this thing. It is well made but does not do what it says. Not worth $350 or more! Also, it tips on almost every turn. The best rides were on staightaways. We used it in an ocean cove- maybe it would work better on a pond or lake? (We don't see how)Save your hard earned money!"
2,Tried on a lake all day!,"We tried this tube on a lake all day- while the kids had fun, it didn't spin- and we tried all 2,3,4 person configurations, leaning this way, sitting that way, with adults trying it too- no spin. Even though it didn't spin, my kids still said it was a ton of fun- I wonder if there's more to it's spinning than just the sitting arrangement? I give it only 2 stars, because it doesn't perform what we bought it for, even though it is still fun."
2,Weird,"This was suggested to me by a grief counselor. I found it rather difficult to comprehend, and not very helpful."
5,Excellent,Highly pleased with purchase. I have several DVDs in my collection on subject and this one went very nicely with the rest.
5,Game changer DVDs,These videos are extremely straight forward and helpful. The instruction is far superior to other videos. Will work for any level of competition. If you can master these drills you can master the game. My son has been through their program and has helped him make his high school varsity team as a freshman.
2,"WONDERFUL, BUT...","The pillows themselves, I am on our fourth one, are marvelous. Very comfortable, I love them. The pillowcases are a horse of a different color. The cheap, heavens know where made, zippers break after a couple of uses making the pillowcase useless. It is a shame that such a nice, and expensive, product is made with such cheap garbage. Shame on you ""Bucky""."
2,Too small,This pillow is too small and even my petite 6 year old agrees. The ends don't even come past your neck and the back is way too thick. Disappointing because it is an otherwise well-made looking product. Now I have to go through the hassle of a return and continue to seek a decent neck pillow.
5,Finally something that works,"After years of filing, soaking, pedicures, etc. my mom used Flexitol and raved about it.So, with doubts, I tried it and guess what?It really works.The thick skin on my heels is softed completely.My only problem is that I need to use it more diligently as the tough skin comes back if I don't.Good product, I recommend it."
5,Bravo!! Toll Barockorchester Herr von der Goltz...,"If you like J.S. Bach, you are going to love this DVD!! The Dolby 5.1 Surround on this is simply brilliant. As a baroque fan, this is as good as it gets. I only get to about four performances a year, but this DVD will fill in those holes!! The six Brandenburg Concertos are performed exactly in the forum for which they were written. The Freiburg Baroque Orchestra under the direction of Gottfried von der Goltz is an small ensemble performing these concertos 'on location' on an intimate scale. The camera shows the muscians peforming the music that they obviously enjoy. Violins, violas, the double bass, cellos, recorders, the harpiscord, and more make these very special performances of these timeless favorites. A superior recreation in sound of a ballroom with these nice renditions of the Bach's concertos. I think he would be proud!!"
3,What's the hurry???,"Yes, these are expertly played, even impassioned, renditions of Bach's historic concertos, but I don't care what ""period practice"" says about faster tempos being ""correct"". To me, the poetry and existential heartbeat of these pieces are ruined by these sweat-stained, high velocity tempos with blurs of notes racing past so fast I'm surprised I didn't hear a Doppler Effect! Where goes the melody when every concerto is running to catch a bus?"
2,Muraqaba,"This book falls short in many ways because it tries to do some difficult things. First of all it was translated which means that the clarity of expression will lose something in the process. The author tries to explain the ""science"" of Sufi meditation in terms of modern science. This is ultimately a pointless task since this is mostly a spiritual matter which has no explanation in currently known science. That is not to say that meditation does not have objective benefits because it does. It just cannot be explained in terms of what we currently know objectively. I think the ""scientific"" explanations are going to be lost on the general public. I have a Ph.D. in chemistry so I think I know poor science when I see it. The major shortcoming is that it does not actually teach one anything about meditation."
5,Holiday Music that Hits the Nail on the Head,A classically-trained musician *and* a woodworker does a great mash-up by using common-found items from the workshop to make Holiday Music. You also gotta love the pic of Woody with the toolbelt and the red plaid shirt we've come to know and love worn by America's Fave Woodworker on PBS.....Norm Abrahm
2,This is an aquired taste,"This is not what I expected; I had seen the television show Tool Time with Tim Allen and on one of the shows, actor's portrayed men from a construction site using their tools to create music. While it may seem strange that I would want to hear Christmas music played by power tools; I just didn't want to hear another round of the barking dogs barking out Jingle Bells played over and over and - again on my neighbors music system which he so kindly installs out side in the yard during the holiday season, so that we can all share some Christmas Cheer (God Bless him he really does try). I just thought to give him some competition on the share the Christmas Cheer thing, well maybe next year somebody will record some Christmas music using chain saws and I can get in line to purchase them."
2,Ken,"Within 2 days of install this door handle replacement had alrady become inoperative. Tried to take it back off to see what the problem may be and one of the plastic support tabs broke off. Perhaps it is a bad one that I received, but I am more inclined to blame it on cheap manufacturing. For what I paid for the part plus shipping I am not overly pleased and still stuck with a non-functional door handle."
5,1996 Toyota Corolla inside door handle,This product arrived early and was easy to put in...especially with the help of some U-tube videos. Works great and at a great price!!
3,"good product, terrible shipping",the product arrived in perfect condition but the shipping is ridiculously slow. i will not order from them again.
3,"Good overview, but...","This text provides a good overview to graphic communications, desktop publishing, and imaging. Now it is a bit dated, but interesting for its historical content. The author seems a bit smug with some of his writing style. The review questions could have been better. There were a number of typos, which detracted from the book."
2,Took the class,"I had taken Mr Bergslands class at TVI around 1998-99 where this book was 'the' text book. It covers lots of basic concepts and covers a wide range of topics. From hardware to software, usage and techniques. As a result much of the book is years out of date (1996). Look elsewhere."
3,not as pictured - look out! & a lot for shipping!,"this was not as pictured, which looks different than the others.when it came it was just 1 more exactly like the other chewycaramels, except more than double the price!"
5,"Nice box, but why?","The three older movies in this set are undeniably among the better ""traditional"" movies about World War II. ""The Thin Red Line"" may not belong in the same set (given its recent origin and approach to war) but it, too, is a movie with merit. My only question about this set is why would you buy them together when they are cheaper to buy if you purchase them separately? Is that slipcase worth the extra bucks? You decide."
3,One Out of Four,"Of the four movies in this collection the only one that would load, both on my DVD player and computer, Tora! Tora! Tora! was the only one. Of the four the only one I don't currently have on VCR tape is this new version of The Thin Red Line. Now I guess I will not be able to see it."
4,World War Winner,"Do you ever catch yourself awake late at night watching old WW II documentaries? Would you like to see a movie that incorporates all of the history PLUS great drama, effects and being tame enough for your children? Look no further. This is one the whole family can appreciate. Balsam's performance is unparalleled in this G-rated but life-like tale of America's most heart felt battle."
3,Transformers,"laying all over my house in pieces, typical toy in a child's life. My son enjoys this toy that pieces fall off of frequently so I guess it is considered a success."
2,Not usual Nikon,"I have had a pair of these several years now. The center hinges have gotten so loose they are hard to hold, the eye cups are so loose fitting they won't stay on. I finally lost one. The optics are OK not great.They almost kept me from buying anymore Nikon's but I have tried some others that are very good."
3,"Decent, if under-budget","The CD sounds kinda generic, like not a lot of money was spent on it, but if you can get past that, the music really is pretty good. The songs are interesting, and don't quite sound like a lot of the other stuff on the radio today. The music is similar to the ""Seattle Sound"" of grunge's hay-day, but with a slightly different flavor. IF nothing else, you get the sence that these guys probably sound pretty good live, because the only problems I had with this album, wasn't the music, but the shortcomings of the recording."
3,Rock on!,"When I first heard this CD, I was not overly impressed. However, after having listened to it a few times, it has really grown on me. I enjoy it, and think most fans of alt. rock/metal would too."
4,ITs good,"Raw, rock n' Roll. Just guitars, a bass (i think) and drums and vocals. Not a lot of ""fluff"". I didn't hear any weird sound effects, or turn-tables. Just rock in its basic form. Catchy songs indeed."
2,works well but very short life,"We purchased one of these 18 months ago and it is now dead. Transformer shorted, while switch and motor are still good.Has no circuit breaker so a short will kill it. Recommend buying another better made unit. Malibu units in generalare of low quality."
4,ML-122 Power Pack,"Works as advertised. I run 100 watts, and may need to add 20 watts when the pond is rebuilt to pond less in two weeks."
2,Timer Stops Working,"Purchased product on August 26, 2012. Now, just 5 months later the timer stopped working. As I read some of the other feedback, this appears to be a common defect."
4,Broken part,"Works great, but taking it out of the box one of the tips that the top hooks to was broken. Using it anyway."
5,Good quality excellent service,very durable .. OEM for my garden lighting .. good price and delivery.would recommend to anyone who has a need for quality low voltage garden lighting.
4,Great,Works great--Read instructions and it will work fine. Did not have Red/Black trigger units in right place-once I did it worked great
3,Setup,"This is my first Intermatic. So I would have appreciated some instructions as to where to connect my 2 wires. It has 3 possible connections (A, B, & C) in the back of the transformer. After some time, I found that the ""C"" spot in this unit was a dead spot. Also, it would have help if the power plug wire (120 volt) would have been 3 feet long not two. The humming is OK being outsides. Also, it doesn't seem to overheat with about 112 watts of load."
2,Timer kupot,Within a month the timer wouldn't turn on the light. Seems the plastic wheel is just not substantial enough to handle a number of cycles. Now I've got it on a light sensor switch and have to hear the motor running the timer. Not what I hope for.
3,Replaced after 4 years,Bought this unit to replace an identical one whose timer died after 4 years of service. Seem like it should have lasted longer
5,The most dependable power packs for low voltage landscape lighting,"Intermatic, Inc. has produced these dependable power packs for many years and they are still the #1 'Tried and True' power packs for low voltage landscape lighting. They are easily identifiable by the white timer dial on the face. They are simple to set and they operate off of time-of-day rather than dusk-to-dawn. Intermatic manufactured these power packs with the Malibu brand name on them until circa 2010. Today, Intermatic still produces the same power packs, but with the Intermatic name on them and they still have the same great 5-year warranty.Don't be fooled by the Malibu name on power packs that have a built-in photo sensor, as these are the 'NEW' power packs made for Malibu in Taiwan and they only have a 1 year warranty. You will get what you pay for."
5,low voltage lighting system,This purchase was to replace a defective low voltage lighting system transformer and controller. It works to perfection!
3,Outdoor Use only,"While not a full review I do have to add that1. It has a sticker that proclaims: ""FOR OUTDOOR USE ONLY"". I was going to mount it inside on a poured basement wall (for outside lights), maybe it self-combusts?2. It is made in MexicoThat is all."
5,Good deal,I purchased this item because I was tired of going out in the evening and morning and fliping the switch.
2,Tactical Shotgun,"This is not the author's best work. Flipping through the pages reminded me of a cut and paste approach to preparing this manuscript from other writing projects. I was hoping for a more comprehensive approach to a complex and important topic. There are important concepts presented (use a highlighter when you find them). There is a lot of filler. If you can, look before buying."
5,not a bad book,"Apart from having to deal with the author's political views that he likes to share sometimes in his book, this is a good book for setting the foundation of your journey of learning shotgun combat techniques. This is the book of the basics, a beginners start guide, if you will."
1,Firearm Tactic's,"I'd like to say the book is well written. An easy read. If you've never read a book on retention and firearm tactics this isn't the book for you. If you have read ANY other book on retention and tactics this isn't the book for you.Unfortunately, everything in the book has been covered elsewhere. I personally did not find one 'nugget' of new information for myself.Synopsis:Well writtenNothing newMove along, nothing to see here."
1,out of date and out of touch...,"Like others have said, these techniques have largely fallen by the wayside. It's ripped out of manuals (just like his Fighting Glock book actually contains advertisements he took from trijicons website as material--not to mention the 2-3 misspellings per page and the fact that one page is repeated without explanation). If you're very frightened and think that liberals are going to arm themselves and kill you, this is the book for you. Shotgun theory for defending malls while wearing ninja outfits and carrying a walkie-talkie."
4,Great book,This is the typical Gabe Suarez approach to combat techniques - plain and simple.If you keep a 12 gauge in the home or truck for defense then you need this book.
5,Easiest HD ever to install,I'll installed a number of different HDs in my years. All seem to end with a call to tech support or a good friend that has experience with this sort of technology. SeaGate made it as simple as can be with the software that loads prior to hardware installation and a printed manual specific to your task. From start to finish the entire process was no longer than 30 minutes and the drive is working flawlessly.
3,Cloning process did work,Functionally disk worked fine and was fast. I got it to clone my winXP disk which has three partitions. Though it recognized the partitions okay and copied everything correctly but the Windows did not boot up.
1,Master Boot Record Corruption With This Drive,This Drive Sucks. Had MBR corruption problems (XP wouldn't boot) twice on the same drive within a 3 month period. Seagate Disk Diagnostics said the HD was Ok. Have had no problems with Western Digital HD that have installed since. It's also very difficult to clone your existing C Drive onto this HD. The 5 year warranty doesn't mean squat if your computer won't boot.
3,It's ONLY 137 GB...,"I'm Buy this HD to use in at firewire box, but the OS only read 137 GB to use 128 GB from 160 GB. I don't Read this before buy this product."
5,title goes here,"Hard drive arrived exactly as promised, on time and in good condition. Installation was fairly easy with some online help ( the instructions did not go into details for Mac) and the hard drive is working well. Very Quiet."
2,Hard drive,Worked fine and easy to install in the beginning. After about 2 months on my security system it started making a lot of noise. Don't think I would buy this again
5,It's a Seagate,I chose this device because it has a long warranty and it fits my portable drive enclosure. It is fast and holds all I could ever want. It wasn't too much money either.
1,Good product...until it crashed,"I'm not much into Seagate, but for the price of this drive, I thought I'd take a chance. Bought this drive a month and a half ago to serve as a 2nd hard drive. Seagate's installation software made it really easy to install. Everything worked great, I didn't hear any noise from it (as reported by other reviews) and I was really happy for over a month before it crashed and froze up my computer. I could not get the drive to work again and it kept my computer from booting up, so I had to remove it. I think I'll go back to Western Digital."
3,Sound quality suffers from mastering,"Many of these tracks have very aggressive - too aggressive - noise removal. The result is more distracting than the noise would have been. Notes seem to emerge from a tissue box, without much attack.Of course Django is always great and look how many great but obscure tracks you get. Worth the money, but unbelievably uneven sound."
5,Seeing is Believing,Book was clean for a used book. Had no issues or problems receiving it. Would buy from this seller again. Thanks
5,Minglewood Rocks the Blues,"This is the best album I have purchased this year. I own all of Matts cd's and this is his finest by far. Blues,rock and country are melded into a unique east coast sound that always gets my motor runnin'. Buy ""Drivin' Wheel"" today,you won't regret it. I promise."
5,Must have in collection...,"Those who love Bach and possibly the greatest masterpiecefor the pianoforte, the Well Tempered Clavier will find this to be a gem. 4 different players each with differentstyles, contrasting each other. There was goodbalance of focus on the hands and other partsof the body. Personally I found Demidenko'sand Hewitt's performances to be superb. Hewitt'sinterpretation of the P&F; #14 in F# minor worthlistening to..."
2,"Focus on graphics, not pianists","I'm disappointed by the production. Besides annoying comments before each piece, the camera focus too much on ""interior design"" or colorful graphics, I do not get much change to see pianist's fingers. It might be better in Audio CD format."
1,Mixed performances of Bach's studies,"Nikolai Demidenko offers an utterly colorless performance, while Joanna Macgregor and Angela Hewitt are pretty good. Andrej Gavrilov is so-so."
5,very good,very good product nice fit works well on the bike or just to scare my 4 year old grand daughter
3,Meditation,"The recording quality is very good. I purchased it based on a reccomendation of a friend but I did not realize that it was a vocal album. The web page did not have a lot of detail nor does the CD when I received it. What I was looking for was background music to help me ""center"". The vocal part is distracting. I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying it but it was not what I thought it was when I bought it."
2,I am constantly replacing these,"My builder used these for can lights outside and inside my house. It seems out of 20 or so can lights, I'm replacing the bulbs 1-3 of these per month.Buy the cheapest you can, and make sure you have a very good ladder."
4,Economical collection,"This is an economical way to to add a collection of poetry to your home library. Many of these poems are standards of high school & college english classes, making this a good purchase for a student."
2,disappointing,"The poetry in this book covers a period from the middle ages to modern times and is arranged in order of date.You will find well known names such as Tennyson, Keats, Wordsworth to name a few.That said, I was surprised by how many of the verses I had never heard of or read before although this is called '100 Best Loved Poems'.Some of the poems featured here are quite obscure. There are some well known ones such as 'Charge of the light brigade' and 'Daffodils' but if you are looking for a book that will help you brush up on all of those half remembered snippets of poetry from your schooldays, then this may not be the choice for you. Having said that, this is a very low price for a collection of poems and if you do want something a little different, then at this price it may be worth adding to your bookshelf."
2,Don't Get the Kindle Version,"I purchased this for my son to use in his 8th grade English class. This looks like a great collection, but I'm giving it only 2 stars because the Kindle edition is awful. It is impossible to navigate to selected poems since they are not linked from the Table of Contents. I'm glad I didn't pay more since this is basically wasted space on a Kindle, but I might consider getting the standard version."
3,"Great price, edition just ok","It's hard to lose at this price, but this is not a great book of poetry. I purchased it for my 5th grader, whose class is starting a unit on poetry. The selections included are hit and miss as representations of their authors, and not all of them are very accessible to the average reader."
1,100 Best-Loved Poems,Wasn't exactly the book i thought it was...disappointed.....and the lenght of time to receive it was longer than quoted...over all a rating of 2 about sums up this experience.
4,Track Listings,1. Take A Bow (Edit)2. Take A Bow (Album Version)3. Take A Bow (Instrumental)1994 Sire Records. British import.
2,Not the best game,"Okay if you like hack and slash without much of a storyline. Not okay if what you want is a real role-playing game like Baldur's Gate. I like R.A. Salvatore's novels also. I was expecting a bit more of a role-playing game as opposed to a strictly linear hack n' slash game. This is much like the LoTR movie-based game that came out at about the same time as the 3rd movie, IIRC."
3,Does not translate well to the PC...,"This game is a fun distraction. True D&D fans beware, you might find some elements of this game distrubing, as it is really more of an action game and some necessarcy changes were made to accomodate this fact. There is a decent backstory (and there should be considering the source, R.A. Salvatore), but this game doesn't really have any more than the basic elements of an RPG game. As I stated in the review, it doesn't play as well on the PC, and doesn't really seem to be designed that way. If you must have it for the PC, buy a Joypad or something. In addition, the voice acting was a real let down. A definite buy for a game station, and with enough aspects of D&D that a collecter might enjoy having it in his or her collection."
2,DaveRM,"Actually, I dislike ported games in general, so this game started out with a big negative bias; unfortunately, the actual gameplay did nothing to change my initial feelings. The game suffers from the same inadequacies as most ported games: the controls are awkward, the save system is virtually useless, and the game, by PC standards, is very short. In addition, this game does not live up to the D&D license to which it aspires, and which was the main reason why I purchased it. About the only positive point is the game's general appearance; it does look quite good, which is not enough for me to recommend it to anyone,"
1,Junk,"Had a tiny leak from day one, a year later the seal gives in during WOT. Couldn't believe that Bosch produces junk, but I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Great for my cat...,"I have a 20+ year old Siamese Chocolate male, a rescue with health issues, like allergies, hip soreness, and sinus conditions. This stuff allows him to live a very nice life in his later years, and brightens his eyes, clears his sinus, and (I can tell!) makes his joints ache a whole lot less."
5,This stuff is great,"My 17 year old kitty was diagnosed with arthritis at the age of 14. He was limping badly and seemed to be in a lot of pain. He is now doing very well, and I'm sure it's because of his daily dose of Kittyvite. His coat is healthy and he still runs around and plays with his toys. I like that I can put a little right on top of his food. Very convenient. I read that the average life span of a cat has gone from 8 years to 16 years because of better nutrition. I can now see my cat living a quality life for many more years to come. Every senior cat should be taking this supplement. The price is reasonable too! I don't want to use words like ""miraculous"" but the change was amazing. Imagine seeing your senior kitty acting like a two year old cat again. I will be buying this product as long as they continue to make it."
5,Works great and my cat loves it,"Our cat, a former stray, has heart problems and cancer. The Kittyvite senior cat vitamin paste has been great! She gets it as a treat after she has taken her pills and she loves it. She has maintained her weight and her coat is shinier. Great stuff!"
5,My kitty is happy again,"My Katrina is happy and that makes me happy. She will be 19 years old around May 10, and except for stiff joints, is in good health. We had been using this product, and all of a sudden we couldn't find it locally. The glucosamine eliminates much of the stiffness and pain in her joints. Alas, we couldn't do without it. She comes to us and meows for her Kittyvite each day because she knows it makes her feel better. We were so happy to find it at Amazon that I bought three tubes. We also have another cat that may be needing it soon. Please don't stop carrying it!"
2,Depends upon the breed...,My cat is a Burmese rag doll (think high maintenance) and very sensitive. I put a little in with his food. Result: a wasted bowl of Iams. I'll stick with Bach's liquid rescue remedy.
1,waste of money,"9 out of 9 cats hated this product! (took to a couple of friends homes to try on their cats after my 4 turned it down. 9 cats, ages 4 to 16 years old, health ranging from perfect to old and somewhat feeble). Only 2 would actually put their tongues on it, and then only for 1 taste before turning away. I didn't expect all of them to like it, but had hoped that my oldest would accept it. No way!It isn't even a paste, so you can't put a dab on your finger and poke it into their mouth. It's black and drippy and messy. It may contain all the healthy stuff it says, but if you can't get it into them it's a waste of money. I also tried mixing a tiny bit with catfood, sardines, and greek yogurt-got that 'you tryin' to poison me?' look. Don't bother with this."
2,"Good book, outrageous translation","While this book does bring Jergovic to an English-speaking world, the translation couldn't drift any further from the original Bosnian/Croatian. After reading the original and this translation in parallel, it is immediately clear that while Tomasevic has created a compelling and well-articulated world, it is nothing like that of the original texts. The liberties that have been taken have totally rejected Jergovic's sentence structure, and do little or nothing to replicate any kind of ""tone,"" ""feel,"" or ""mood"" -- words that are frequently tossed about in justifying this type of translation. Unfortunately, I think it's the only English version there is.Sorry, Amazon doesn't allow the Croatian characters for the names..."
2,Ordinary Book,"Let me first admit that I wrongly assumed it to be a long story based in Ottoman-time Bosnia. The book turned out to be a collection of short stories from the Bosnia of 1990s civil war. I was hugely disappointed by my own expectations. The book might appeal to anyone interested in the 1990's civil war in Bosnia, but not for me. Some stories are so short (some run into just 2 pages) and end so abruptly that I gave up reading the book after a few stories."
4,All the greats in one movie,"All the Shaw Bros stars in one movie: the 5 Venoms, Ti Lung, Fu Sheng, etc. The story is told largely in flashback, which makes it a bit tough to follow at times, but the quality of martial arts is great."
5,Easy on and off; Much better than Motorad,This cap can be unlocked with one hand and placed back on without the key. Much easier operation than the Motorad plus the Motorad did not seal well causing the check engine light. I've had this brand for eight years till it broke and I've bought the same replacement after a brief one week with the Motorad. Wish the key was nicer like the Motorad but thats a small thing.
4,Stant 10511 Locking Fuel Cap,"This Cap is for the 2005 Chevy Silverado Extended Cab 2WD.There are two separate fuel cap designs that GM made for this truck. One has a threaded neck and one does not have a threaded neck. You have to look at the original fuel cap that came with your truck. My truck originally came with a non locking non threaded fuel cap from the factory. So I replaced it with the Stant 10511 locking fuel cap. You cannot find these anywhere! Pepboys, Kragen, Autozone etc! I found it on Amazon finally! It is a quality locking fuel cap. Do not buy Fram fuel caps as they cause your check engine light to come on!"
5,GTO Replacement Cap,"While there is a TSB for the stock filler cap on the GTO, I didn't feel like replacing it yet again with a flawed OEM. This one fit perfectly, gets the job done."
3,Locking gas cap,Very difficult to insert the key for removing the cap. Intinally i was afraid that one day I would not be able to unlock it but so far no issue just difficult to insert the key. Other than that I have no complaints.
2,It could have been better,"I wish they had identified the top or bottom of the key slot or they could have used a double sided key, since the key isn't guided into the lock very well it's always a bit of a pain to figure out which end is up.Another thing that would help, would be some kind of retainer, even if it didn't exactly match the original, at least some kind of lanyard attachment so I didn't have to worry about losing my new gas cap.At least the fit and function are close to the original cap, just slightly loose."
1,"does not seal properly, sets engine code","I tried this locking gas cap on my 07 Chevy Colorado and it set an engine right away....same code as if the gas cap would have been left off. The treading of the cap looks quite different than the stock cap and it does not appear to get a good connection of the filler neck. I've used Stant locking caps on other vehicles with no problems, but this one is not worth buying for a Chevy truck."
2,implausible and not much fun to read,"Sorry, but the theory that Eleanor spent her entire life in love with and having a passionate affair with a secret lover,within the courts she was involved in, without that being detected is very hard to accept; as is the idea that the secret lover is the father of several of her children. Also, the book takes FOREVER to get to her introduction and relationship with Henry II, which is a serious flaw in my opinion. Too much time on the crusades, too little on England. If you want a good historical look at Eleanor, check out Sharon Kay Penman's books on Henry and Eleanor. They are fun to read and hold the interest much more than this novel did."
3,Simultaneously fascinating and annoying,"I picked this book up on a lark. I enjoy historical novels and this one caught my eye. I've not read anything else by the author.Kaufman does a good job detailing the specifics of the time. She has a gift for descriptive prose that surpasses many of her peers. She tells this story of Eleanor in a captivating way. That's the 'fascinating' part.However, the book is really more a romance novel -- with a completely made up, fictional character! -- than it is historical. I found that annoying and ultimately disappointing."
2,what a disappointment this was,"I picked this book up after reading the wonderfully detailed historical fiction of Margaret George, and found it to be extremely disappointing. It lacks the detail of the period --no descriptions of the various castles or clothing to give the reader any sense of the general daily life of Eleanor. Ms. Kaufman only touches this area once, in Eleanor's meeting with her aunt the Empress Irene. I'm coming out of this book not caring about any of the characters.The style of writing seemed very sophomoric (any average joe could have written this book) and I really could have done without the troubador poems on every other page. And Ms. Kaufman includes items that don't seem to get explained as to why they are there (ie Eleanor's grandfather appears to her naked several times --why?).In general, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone looking for a complete picture of Eleanor."
2,"Great character, choppy writing","Familiar with the historical figure of Eleanor of Aquitaine, I was excited to come across this novelization of her life. Unfortunately, this is not the tale I expected. While I loved the character of Eleanor herself, somewhat flawed history and strange, jumpy writing made the story itself impossible to really enjoy. Frustrated, I found myself skipping over parts just to see what happened to Eleanor, and I finally abondoned my quest when I realized I was not enjoying it. Even in that, I was not satisfied, as Eleanor's strong personality and tenuous situation stayed with me, unreconciled. Ms. Kaufman has created a memorable character, but she (Eleanor, that is) deserves a better story to live in."
2,Pretty dreadful,"The only reason I finished this book is that I make it a policy to plow on through to the end of any title, just to give the author the benefit of the doubt. This book however was not worth the effort: for all the excitement of Eleanor's life this book was actually boring, the characters pretty one-dimensional and the dialogue unbelievable. Yawn. A much better title for Historical Fiction (in my opinion) is The Royal Physician's Visit by Enquist."
1,The Book of Eleanor,"Well written, but rubbish none the less. As the book is filled with historical inaccuracies, it is disconcerting that people unfamiliar with Eleanor will use this book as the basis for their opinions. The book is based upon a ridiculous premise: that Eleanor would be allowed to choose her own husband and marry for love. Basically the author made Eleanor a victim; forced into two marriages and never at fault for any of her actions (not even the deaths of 7,000 soldiers during the Second Crusade). For readers who would like to learn about the ""real"" Eleanor, read Alison Weir's excellent biography."
3,Decent,"I honestly expected this book to be better. I usually enjoy historical fiction, and I have always been interested in Eleanor of Aquitaine. It has its good parts, and I'll admit it is fun to see historical characters brought to life. But something falls short in this book. I can't quite pinpoint what it is, but I think it has something to do with the romance between Eleanor and Rancon. It just didn't strike me as a particularly captivating romance, perhaps because the character of Rancon annoyed me. In fact, very few of the characters were likeable. And the portrayal of Eleanor did not do her justice. However, since it had its good parts, I still give it a three."
1,Still boring after all these years..,"I looked at this book at my local B&N last week. I could not believe this author is still selling manuscripts and getting published. She is terrible! I read Shield of Three Lions years ago and it was very poorly written...the characters were predictable and dull...it was awful. I had hoped there was an improvement in her writing since then, and considered buying this book. Glad I did not, as most reviews are negative."
2,Not the best Eleanor book out there,"I didn't feel that the characters were very sympathetic; I enjoyed Sharon Kay Penman's Time and Chance better than this. I have enjoyed Kaufman's other books. This one, however, seemed a little shallow to me."
4,Fascinating Historical Fiction,"This book is about Queen Eleanor, the mother of Richard the Lionhearted, who appeared in Kaufman's other book, Banners of Gold. However, you won't recognize that Eleanor here, nor does it link with her other books at all. I kept expecting Alix of Wanthwaite to show up, but she never did. This book seems to be more factual and less fiction.It's a fascinating story, and Eleanor is a strong female lead. Read it as if you had not read the Alix books, and you will enjoy it."
5,My Review,"I love these little lights, you just hook them up to ANY 12 power sores and they work great. I even used them in my dash on my truck. found a ground and hooked it in with the dimmer switch for my lights and it dims along with all my lights in my dash. cant say enough about these things. they last forever to..."
3,Fletcher SpringMate Clip Tool,This tool is not as easy to use as the directions would indicate. Sometimes the clip is wider than the slot for the clip and when trying to insert the tool on the clip the clip is pushed to far into the frame making retrieval very difficult. Other times the clip cannot be griped adequately and the clip cannot be removed. Several times the clip has broken when the tool is twisted as per the instructions.
4,Cat crack!,My boy cat loves this stuff and will eat it straight from the tube! My girl cat will not and she is really the one that needs it. Ugh.
5,Fantastic!,"Worked great. Our little kitty wouldn't touch the malt-flavored petroleum jelly products (like Petromalt, which works great if your cat will eat it). This one is mineral oil based, so it's thinner than the other kinds and has a bit of a fishy smell to it. After being initially suspicious, our cat gobbled up the dosage.Certainly glad to not have to clean up hairball vomit every day... silly shedding cats. Great product!"
2,This game cheats!,"I got it to work no problem on my PS2, but, in addition to control issues like what others have had, I found myself losing when the AI would constantly roll just the right die amount, always know where my ships were, and even change the rules, mid-game, in chess (My pawn can't make a two-space diagonal attack but the opponent can?).I originally bought this for Go, because I wanted an electronic version. That game isn't bad, but if you play a certain way, you can slaughter the AI every time.It might be fun against other people, but if you're playing alone, be warned that the AI very-visibly cheats!"
2,Looks Cheesy,"I was expecting the graphics of this product to be a little better then Atari, since it was listed as a play station 2 game. (not the latest console) but is much better then Atari. However the graphics in this game looked a little ole school. It reminds me of those mini games that use to come on floppy disk. Waste of money if you are looking for something to enjoy for hours. I played a few games, but got bored of the tired looking graphics and threw the game in the box with other dull and boring games.Special Hint - my play station 2 is connected to a 50 inch samsung tv, with hdmi with settings of 1080 and this didn't help the graphics."
1,I am SO peed off!!!!,"My PS2 does not play this ""blue disc"". I've tried everything I've read online and it still doesn't work. $10 is too much to pay for the hassle of trying to get this effing thing to work and have it NOT WORK. I was really looking forward to having a chess game for my PS2, I don't have any other console and wasn't looking to buy a new one. Why do they still manufacture these blue discs if they don't work? I want my $ back but I've already fiddled with the disc trying to get it to work. DON'T BUY THIS."
3,great music,I like listening to music while I Solve the puzzles and this game has some outstanding tracks to listen to.
3,Good fun for One,"This was bought for my daughter who begs to play board games all them time. This game satisfies that need when we can't. Some of the games could be a little more challenging, but overall they are fun."
1,Should have read reviews first,I should have read the reviews first. This game came fast and quick but does not show up on my ps2. It shows up as error on my ps2. I just wish I read the reviews first before I bought this game.
3,blue disc games,"I'm sorry. I've never played this game. I just wanted to share my secret to getting those blue disc games to play in your ps2. If you can't get your ps2 to read those blue disc older games, here's how i get them to work. simply take some scotch tape,& tape a square around the hole in the center of the disc. Try to tape the square as close to the hole as you can get it, without covering the hole. Once you've taped your square, it should work. It's worked every time for me, & I hope it works for you to."
1,Disatisfied,"Was so disappointed when I got this game. The quality was very poor and player options very few. Only one control can be used at a time. So if more than one person wants to play, the control has to be passed back and forth."
2,NOT ANY FUN,I ORDERED THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS. SHE HATES THIS GAME WE NEVER PLAY IT. IT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY!
4,therapist's helper,"I, as a therapist who works with folks who have sexual addictions, have found this book to be a good resource to supplement the work we do together in sessions. It is well written and seems to address the issues in a gentle manner, allowing clients to work at a comfortable pace.Lorraine LaBarre, LCSWNew London, CT"
4,Sex addiction workbook,This workbook is practical and empirically supported. Its exercises are clear and cognitively based and includes a survey to measure the degree of sex addiction. I use it in my work with patients in psychotherapy.
4,Working with Sexual Addictions,"Interesting and informative book for those working with clients and or patients that have sexual addictions. However, this book could have been improved by having a section or a chapter regarding Family Counseling and or Therapy for service providers working with individuals with sexual addictions.Nestor R. Mantilla"
2,find a reader,"This review is for Audio Book only:The Book is , as with all of Bagley, a great story.The Reader is however, about as inept as anyone I have ever heard. My nine year old niece is much more fluent.This man stumbles over words, slurs the delivery and is generally difficult to listen to.Read the book yourself, by all means."
3,www.informit.com/printer circuit board designer's reference,Received book in good condition. Was able to download sofware on line but unable to open/use it. It'd have been perfect if the software disk was accompanied.
3,Wrong Color,"These towels are actually MUCH lighter than they appear online. I would never describe them as sage - maybe a mint green? They seem to be soft, good quality, and they arrived quickly."
3,Pretty and fancy,"This towls are very pretty if you only used them as a decoration, but they are not very absorbant when used."
3,Encounter in the Snow,One of my favorite images from the original trilogy is that of Han Solo on the tauntaun to rescue Luke. I really purchased this set for the Han Solo/tauntaun figures.The sculpts on the tauntaun and Chewie are really well done. What disappointed me was the lack of facial detail on the two Han Solo figures that are part of the set. The facial mold does not compare favorably to the detail present in the Han Solo that was released as a single Battle Packs Unleashed figure.
1,Bent and Torn,I received the drum head and it was torn. Would be much easier to go to a store and purchase it.
5,This record is pure.,"This album is beautiful. Songs as perfect as a bar of soap. Sin, temptation, burden, joy, well scrubbed beauty all delivered with no pretentions or preaching, a pearl."
5,Buy this now.,One listen to this CD and you'll realize how phony and boring most other folk/Americana singers really are. This is the real deal. Ms. Braun sings straight from the heart and the songs have a truly timeless quality to them. More people should hear this.
1,not heavy duty quality shower curtains,I will never purchase this shower curtain again..not heavy duty by any means..one of the holes has already ripped so just hangs...very disappointed in them..
3,Plain Jane shower curtain,"I rated this item 3 stars because there were no metal grommets in the holes to hang the curtain (even though the picture shows them). Additionally, I would not classify this as a ""heavy duty"" shower curtain. The thickness of the curtain didn't impress me. Other than that, its just a plain old shower curtain. In this case, your getting what you pay for."
3,A small dose of reality,"This is a well made and nicely illustrated cookbook, but the few recipes offered are simplistic, and to a large degree, Americanized versions of their native originals. Additionally, there is little here in the way of originality or creativity. I don't know of a single recipe that can't be found in numerous other books. If you are looking for a book with a variety of recipes from different countries that are tame enough for American tastes and simple enough for unskilled cooks, this would be a good book. The more adventurous would be advised to look elsewhere for inspiration."
5,A great buy...,"A masterpiece collection from the masters of photography. A well compiled selection from the archives of NGM...this book is truly value for money. If you have espace on your coffe-table, buy this..."
2,not that great,"I wanted to like this necklace and since there were no previous reviews, I decided to take a chance because I've had good experiences with Silverspeck's products previously. When I received this necklace, it was easily noticeable that the pearls had blemishes on them, especially when the light shines on them which amplifies the blemishes even more. I don't quite remember how well the pearls matched in size and shape because I decided to return them so quickly. You're probably better off getting the white pearl set by Silverspeck for $9.99."
4,Enjoyable straight ahead jazz,The two brothers are tight and their music reflects a joyous feel to it. Pete played on a number of Henry Mancini albums. Both Pete and Conte are professionals and it shows. My only minor complaint is that a few of the songs on the set are not up to the standard of the others. This does not prevent the listener from wanting to come back for more. Repeated listenings are a pleasure.
1,Very poor quality.,"I'm really unimpressed with the quality of this item. The company appears to be using the cheapest possible machining procedures with practically no quality control. One of the caps easily slides over the threaded shaft (not exactly what I'd call a strict tolerance). It will definitely not hold weight plates in place, making this item not only defective but potentially hazardous. Do yourself a favor and hunt down a trusted brand."
1,"Defective Item, Health Hazard","Did not buy from Amazon, but the product is the same. The pair of dumbbells handles I received had immediate chrome flaking. I took a napkin to wipe of to what seemed to be just dust, but in fact it was the unfinished chrome. Or maybe it is finished and it was just finished in a unsatisfactory manner. This chipped off chrome degrades the products useful life and provides to be an airborne health hazard. I highly suggest not to buy this product and search for another option."
1,Chinesee JUNK,"I didn't buy this product from Amazon so it's not their fault but I did buy locally. After getting home with the product I unwrapped the plastic from the box, opened the box, and found the inside to be moldey. If that was not bad enought (you could see mold and smell it) I looked at the bars and one of the nuts were rusty and crome paint was flaking off (under crome paint was deep rust). This is nothing but junk so I returned and told the local store (not that cared). Do not buy, spend a little more money and get something better rather than from CAP."
3,fluffy but well done,"It's a bit fluffy and shallow, and Fowler's attempts to psychoanalyse her subjects tend to fall flat, but she still manages to educate and entertain. I did wonder about her portrayal of Jackie Onassis and of the Duchess of Windsor, both of whom came off looking like truly dreadful people. IMHO the sections on Elinor Glyn and Marlene Dietrich are the best.(I think the Consuelo referred to in the book as Elinor Glyn's friend is Consuelo Yznaga, who was in fact Duchess of Manchester. Consuelo Vanderbilt was duchess of Marlborough. Both are profiled in Fowler's ""In A Gilded Cage."")"
4,Review for Help! I'm trapped in profecional wrestlers body,This book is a must read for all wrestling fans. Even for people who don't like wrestling. This book is really funny. It is about two determend kids who want to go to a wrestling match. They get front row seats and then his friend is not there. Then comes the min event and then they find there friend in the wrestling match. He is being beat in by one of the wrestlers. Can he save his friend?
1,Miserable And Vile (ZERO star rating),"This movie, I am thinking it is very very bad, and not good at all. Do you understand?I won't describe it, but at least one scene was simply vile, and simply wasn't needed.The original short story is fine. The long book which Silverberg wrote is fine also. But this movie is not in tune with either Asimov's or Silverbergs writing.Even if I wasn't comparing it to a previously published story, I would say this movie is miserable. And vile.The script is miserable. The acting is miserable. All of it is miserable. And some of it is vile.This is what I am thinking. And by the way, it sucks worse than any movie I have ever seen. And some of it is vile."
1,Truly insulting to Asimov fans.,"There are so many complaints for this film that it would take too much time to enumerate. On a world with 6 stars and constant light, the entire planet is of a middle-eastern/Indian skin tone, except for our handful of protagonists, who are surprisingly caucasian. The societal conventions, including such things as dress and makeup are also uninspiringly late 20th century American, down to lipstick and pony tails. Our heroes use camping lanterns to explore caverns yet whip out laser pistols to fight off sword-wielding attackers.Robe-wearing religious fanatics are our antagonists, and seeing a similarly clad David Carradine confronting them makes one expect to see a sudden kung fu showdown, and a Japanese anime-style soundtrack clashes horribly with all too 'Roger Corman' plain cinematics.An hour and a half of my time I wish I could get back."
1,Horrible,"This story was originally a short story by Isaac Asimov that was critically acclaimed. It was next expanded into a novel that received mixed reviews. It has now further deteriorated into a dreadful film.This film was far below B movie standards. Every element of it was poorly done. I've seen better acting in high school assembly halls. The screenplay was horrible with dialogue so bad it could make you retch. The music was shrill and the sound quality poor. The special effects were below 1960's standards. Even the editing was poor. The whole film was simply pathetic.Asimov's original theme of the battle between science and religion was almost completely lost in an attempt to make the story into a ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" adventure. The explanation of why darkness fell on the planet centered on the eclipse of one sun, but failed to explain what happened to the other five.This film was abysmal. I rated it a 2/10. Stay away."
1,Nightfall NOT!,"I rate this as 1 star because there appears to be no option for ZERO which is what it is really worth. I can't believe that Isaac allowed his name to be associated with such a corruption of his brilliant original short story. Its this kind of rubbish that gives SciFi a bad name! Come on you Hollywood scriptwriters, how about an Elijah Baley movie such as ""The Caves of Steel"" or ""The Naked Sun"", and stick closely to Asimovs story line this time."
1,This movie is bad.,"This movie is bad. Very bad. Extraordinarily bad.To put it in perspective, a group of devoted movie fans who once cheerfully watched a double feature of Robot Jox and Teenage Mutant Turtles II -- in short, a group of people with no discernible standards whatsoever -- this group of people voted to turn this film off after a mere 30 minutes of viewing.The sole good thing I can say about this movie is that it shares a title and a basic idea in common with a story by Isaac Asimov. Other than that, the effects, acting, storyline, production values, dialogue, art, locations, and direction are all either completely non-descript or outright lame.To be fair it should be noted that the one person who voted in favor of continuing to watch this film was also the one person who had never read the Asimov story. If you fit into this category, it may be possible for you to grit your teeth and sit through the whole thing. I can't think of a single reason to, though."
1,Terrible Film,"OK, I'm an Asimov fan and I have no delusion that a movie will be anything like his writing. But boy is this a bad film. Shot badly and acted badly with the exception of Joseph Hodge in the male lead. Terrible acting, editing, photography. Poor Isaac, had he only known! Does Corman try to make the worst films known to man? Well this one is a success story if that is his aim. Rent it for kicks."
1,Nightfall 2000,This is -THE- worst adaptation of an Isaac Asimov story by far. I thought I was ordering the 1988 version directed by Paul Meyersberg. The Meyersberg version is also low budget but clearly superior. Gibby (director of Nightfall 2000) seemed to be more inerested in providing work for stuntmen in training than telling a story. Where can I get my money back? Else this DVD ends up in the microwave.
1,"Worse Than ""Plan 9 from Outer Space""!","Rent this only if you and your friends like to play ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" and make fun of really bad movies! This is the most amateurish film I have ever seen. Apparently filmed in India, it features red paint put onto the swords with a brush to simulate blood. Giant unrealistic flames burn in a model village worthy of a scene from a Godzilla epic. Look closely at the end when a bad guy is burning to death and you can see his protective helmet! Only a crowd of folks with a good sense of humor and possibly a six-pack or a bottle of wine can make this movie bearable. It is an insult to Isaac Asimov's story.Aside to AMAZON.COM: You need to allow a rating of ZERO stars!"
2,Read the book instead,"Very few famous sci-fi books get decently treated when it comes to bringing them to the screen (Starship troopers comes to mind). Like Starship troopers, the origional story and characters are largely ignored, to make an enjoyable film that bears little or no resemblence to the book.I would advise you save your cash and buy the book instead. And while you are there get starship troopers as well, it si MUCH better better (and different) than the movie."
3,Only because it's Asimov,"I didn't find it quite as bad as many of the other reviews but it's a long way from good. I have several feet of bookshelf dedicated to Asimov so I felt obligated to purchase it. And Nightfall is considered by many the greatest short SF story ever written. All I can say is that this was a injustice to a great story.I have to comment on one reviewer claiming this was the worst movie ever made. I believe that distinction goes to Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."""
1,Disappointed due to product reliability,"When it works, it's a good TV. Mine broke three months out of warranty and the repair cost was very expensive."
5,Great Teleivision,I shopped around for a long time and decided that the Sony KLV-S32A10 was going to be my next TV but then I happened upon this one and was blown away. It was hard to pay the extra $$$ for it but I've learned that you get what you pay for and this is no exception. If excellence is what your looking for and you're willing to pay the extra $$$ for it this is the set for you. It doesn't have the DLP technology but I think the picture is better than the sets I viewed that have it. I connected it to a Direct TV DVR and the picture is outstanding. I added an antenna (rabbit ears) just to see if HD was all that I had heard it was and discovered that it was better but not that much better. This is truly the best investment I've made in home entertainment in a very long time. If you're interested in quality and features that'll be around for a long time buy one of these. You won't be disappointed.
2,"Too much action, not enough plot","I admit I'm not a huge Iron Man fan, but this book really caught my eye. I figured reading it would be a good introduction to his character, but if this book is ANY indication of what the comic is like...let's just say I'm dissappointed. The book's plotline was WAY too simple! As a matter of fact, it seemed like just a petty excuse to write some nifty battle scenes between numerous villains. The book goes something like this: MODOK is trying to reconstruct the Cosmic Cube, and he needs different components for it. As a result of this, he sends out adaptoids of old villains to retreive them. Iron Man, War Machine, Cap, and Black Panther split up and try to prevent this from happening. After each one of them has had their battle (which takes over 100 pages) they meet up back at Stark Enterprises and battle MODOK. The end. Greg Cox's writing IS clean and fluid...but his plotlines lack punch. Bottom line: if your looking for a good Marvel novel, look somewhere else!"
2,Good? Yeah Right!,"I am the biggest fan of Iron Man, but this book was very disappointing! I am a huge fan of the comics and when I read this book i felt that the writers just didn't even try to write a good book. There was too much action and not enough plot. The writers did not bother to describe the charactors. The story did not have enough of the main charator [Iron Man] and focused more on War Machine and Caption A. The story was loose and had too much going on at once. The book jumped around and didn't stay with the charactors."
1,Simply awful!,While Greg Cox's first Iron Man novel was passable and somewhat entertaining this book was a complete weaste of time. There really was no plot at all and what story he did make of this mess was so simplistic it made me sick. I skipped huge chunks of this story and still feel as though I missed nothing. To give an example of how bad it is Iron Man contempates to himself numerous tricks the enemies may be doing then dismisses them only for them to come true. THis happens EVERY CHAPTER and it was so predictable it was just awful. I can't think of a single good thing to say about this novel.
1,Bullshit,"i got item, opened and guess what? All of the disk case were cracked and shattered. I wasted my money and my time for this product"
1,Worst DVD's i have ever bought,I tried all 5 DVD's and none of it copied i know its not my cd/dvd burner for it is new and burns ever other brand of dvd and cd on the market but if your looking to make a wind chime then these are the best for that
1,Broke!,"I bought this to serve 2 gallons of ice tea at a time. The third time I used it, I was moving it to the table and the entire glass bottom of the darn thing just dropped off! Of course, that meant 2 gallons of sticky ice tea just poured out all over me and the floor. I am sure I didn't put hot tea in it which would have caused it to crack. It was totally bizarre. I read here that others have said that the glass is uneven and perhaps the pressure of the 2 gallons of liquid was simply too much for the glass...I'm not sure."
2,Wouldn't buy this product again,The instructions for putting in the spigot were in Spanish! The box it is arrived in was also in Spanish. The plastic spigot had little plastic shavings because of poor cleaning before shipping. I was disappointed. I wouldn't buy this product again.
4,What fun,Probably was not meant to have a humorous twist but it did. If you don't take the story too seriously it is a good fun read.
4,Classic & worth the read.,I listened to this as an Audio Book which I borrowed from the library. It was so enjoyable that I decided to read more of Mark Twain. It's great that Kindle has him for free.
3,OK,"This was not one of Twain's best in my opinion. I have always enjoyed his work, but this seemed to be lacking."
4,The Tragedy of Puddnhead Wilson,"I enjoyed this story overall. It is a bit of a mystery, not a who done it,but will the truth be reviled? There were a few spots that drug on a little longer than I would have liked but it gave you a better glimse into the sleepy town and its people setting. Do take note that it is an older story and slavery is a part of the story."
1,Poor edition of a great novel,"Do not purchase this edition of the novel. It is riddled with typographical errors, many of which obscure or distort Twain's meaning. I regret that I adopted this edition for a college course.The novel itself is an excellent short tale, a kind of murder mystery, in which Twain examines the paradoxes of slavery and racial hierarchy with a great deal of wit and subtlety. It takes place in a Mississippi River town in Missouri c. 1850, and shows how the institution of slavery shapes (and deforms) the life of a political community. Roxy, a slave who is 1/16th black (""and that sixteenth did not show""), is one of Twain's most interesting and delightful characters."
4,good book,What can anybody say about Mark Twain. His books and short stories are always entertaining and fun to read anytime.
4,Pudd'nhead Wilson,"Another Mark Twain classic: More beautiful language, authentic English as well as dialect, that weaves the tragedy of slavery throughout small town America for the benefit of all from the 19th to the 21st Centuries. I loved it."
5,Good read,"This is a great example of Mark Twain's contempt for slavery. It is very interesting, ant the story line is very good. I enjoyed this book very much"
4,The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson,Somehow I skated through life thus far without ever reading any Twain. Found this book perfect as a first and looking forward to the next! Great reading.
4,Perfect Pillow,This pillow makes me sleep better at night. When I first got this pillow I was a little skeptical. The smell of the pillow was a little weird but after a while I got used to it and now I kind of like it. I like that it molds to my neck to make me extremely comfortable.
