1,:(,"Love the story, not the cussing.Was a little disappointed, had to get rid of it.Can't they make movies with out using Gods name every time."
4,I think this is a great movie!,Well I'm biased because my cusin is in this movie. He dances with madonna in the bar sceen.. But I still think that it's a good movie.
3,"Great concept, poorly executed","Poor writing and direction push what should be a heart-warming family film deep into hackneyed mediocrity.Geena Davis and Lori Petty give the strongest performances, but it's not enough to call this a ""good"" film."
3,Very Good movie-horrible ending,This was on its way to being a superb movie until the ending left us with the message that lying is the best way to deal with a problem and that ignorance and selfishness should be rewarded.
2,Very well written movie..........,"However, I did not like the DVD. I was disapointed at the lack of extras in the DVD version. It's just the movie with the wide screen cut. If you don't care about all the extras you could have seen, then pick it up it is better wide screen. I know because, I saw it in the theater and I bought the VHS version."
1,DVD A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN,"DVD DIDN'T WORK AT ALL. IT WOULD SAY ""WRONG REGION"" OR ""WRONG DISC"" I wouldn't try to send it back because having to pay double postage."
2,A League of Their Own,"I hate to say this but I was disappointed. The entire movie was great, but the ending was cut off. The last 7 minutes of the movie was missing and went right into the credits."
4,Great movie. Don't bother with the Special Edition,"I have liked this movie for a long time, and when I cued up the director's commentary for the movie, I was looking forward to hearing some of the thoughts and feelings related to especially moving scenes such as ""Dottie""'s dropping the ball. However, the entire commentary led by Penny Marshall trivialized each scene by irrelevant discussions (example: the director talked about ladies' underwear during the next to last scene between Dottie and Kit) rather than decent analyses and their thinking.So, if you like the movie, please buy it, but forego the special edition. It wasn't worth it.A League of Their Own"
5,You Go Girls!,"I have always loved this movie. It is filled with love, vulnerability, life lessons and the often-times complicated relationship between siblings. It is fun and will make you smile; and it is also a bit sad so you may end up shedding a tear or two. It is a lovely movie and one to purchase and keep in your DVD library."
5,I loved A League of Their Own,"A legue of their of was a great story about family, friends and baseball. This movie showed courage and it was very funny!"
5,Great women's sports movie!,"There are not that many truly good movies with women at the center of it. This one is amazing, and it's about women playing sports as well, which is even better. This movie is a fictionalized story about the real life ""All American Women's Baseball League"" that happened in the US during WWII. This movie stars Geena Davis as the all-star catcher, Lori Petty as Genna's sister. These two are great together, this movie not only deals with the first women's baseball league, but also tells a great relationship between these two sisters. Their coach, played by Tom Hanks, is a character who starts off not doing a great job, as he doesn't think ""girls' can't play baseball""; but by the end of the movie he's changed his mind. Other stars in this movie are Madonna, and Rosie O'Donnell. If you are a girl or a women, I would strongly suggest seeing this movie, and even if you are a guy I think you'd like this as it mainly is a movie about sports - it just has women at the center of it!"
4,Watch it with your daughters.,"What a fine example for young girls. My daughters and I watch this film on a regular basis as a reminder that women can do anything they put their minds to. Gina Davis and Tom Hanks have magical chemistry (no wonder they are Oscar winners)and the supporting cast members are winners too. I also remind my children of the color barrier that once existed in America. If you haven't viewed this film there is a wonderful scene where a ball rolls away from one of the team members and a African-American woman picks it up and throws it back (very well). I ask my girls ""Why can't she play?"" And they know the answer. This film is well worth the investment. It will become a favorite of your daughters as well."
1,This isn't a winner......,"I've seen this movie. Even with Tom Hanks, Jon Lovitz and Geena Davis staring in it. I just couldn't enjoyed it. I found that both Madonna's character and Rosie O'Donnell's character were just flat awful. It took away from the movie, itself."
3,Captivating travelogue but sometimes superficial analysis,"This is an interesting travelogue by a writer who is very well versed in his subject matter. His approach is very down to earth, and he takes the reader by the hand through his journey. One does get a detailed experience from reading this book, not quite as good as being there but close. At times the book is captivating.On the down side, I found the narrative a bit convoluted. His English is quite rich and very articulate but somehow fails to excite the reader. At times, it was down right boring. I had to put the book down a few times and pick it up again before I got through with it.Also, his analyses, where he attempts to propose any, are a bit superficial. Besides providing an account of his travels, Harvey tries to propose to the reader a discussion of Buddhism as he learns it from the rimpoches he meets. Here he inevitably becomes anecdotal."
5,The cutest ghost book ever,"If you have a little one who loves ghosts or even is afraid of ghosts, this book is a must-have. It is very, very simple and easy to follow. The artwork is great and the ghosts are so cute that they aren't scary in the slightest. My three-year old requests this one regularly at bedtime. Ghosts are a favorite theme of hers, and this is probably her favorite ghost book, even though it might be the shortest one. I think you could probably get a child who is fearful of ghosts to be less scared of them with this book. How can you be afraid of ghosts who catch snowflakes with their tongues and have snowman building contests?"
2,"Snore, Snore","Sorry, this may hit the right spot for some, for me it was snoozeville. Brazil has so much good music, this is not on that list. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Keep looking, better yet, always listen to the samples first. I'm just sorry I didn't before I bought. Anyone want to trade, I will take any offers."
2,I'd like to thank the Academy...,"This album features a large English chorus singing traditional Christmas songs. Songs are sung not just in English, but also in French and German. It's certainly well sung, but it's pretty boring to my ears. Most of the songs don't have that much energy, other than the bombastic ""Hark! The Herald Angels Sing"". But fans of classical music will probably enjoy it more than me."
5,I love it,"This is excellent Christmas music. Of the choir Christmas music I have heard, I think this is great because there seems to be such a great balance between the male and female singers. Its exactly how I'd want Christmas carolers to sound. If you like how the music previews sound then you will like this cd."
1,Elevator Music from the Romantic Period...,"I had to find out for myself if there really existed some unjustly neglected piano concertos from the romantic period. If neglected ""gems"" do exist, they are certainly not these concertos. For me, these compositions were just ""adequate"". Sort of the ""elevator-music"" from the romantic period of the piano concerto. Heavy on virtuosity, without any particularly distinguishing features. I couldn't remember a single melody from these concertos, even after repeated listenings. That's how unremarkable they are."
5,Awesome!,"I was recently hanging out in record store that lets you listen before you buy. I'll usually grab a couple of LPs and CDs by artists I'd never heard of before. Travelin' Light, the whole CD, by Gabrielle Goodman blew my head off! Great feel, great energy, sophisticated, fun, and deep."
5,I LOVE this Flavor!! I have Bought It Twice!!,You have to try this flavor!! It is one of my favorites in the Lip Stuff Line. I have ordered multiple flavors and this one is one of my favorites so far!1 I hope to try them all some day!!
4,My lip stuff--- chai,"Goes on smooth and lasts for a long time. I bought several different flavors of Lip Stuff, and I'm happy with every single one of them!"
5,Awesome Products,"I have Lemonade Ice Cream, Gummy Bear, and Banana Cheesecake. My little girl love's these as much as I do, the first one we choose to try was Gummy Bear and she said it is like I am eating them. To be honest it was like you were eating them. The smell isn't faint at all and the scents are true to their names. Also the other scents were great also. I really liked the Lemonade Ice Cream a lot. It has started to get cold were I live again so this was perfect to try out for the moisturizer part of the products. I was really happy with the softness of my lips after using the products plus it worked on my kids too. These would make a great basket stuffer for Easter or stocking stuffer and just to simply by for your little girl or yourself. You will love the texture of these products and how well they soften your lips."
1,Not worth it,It doesn't taste or smell like Grand Marnier I was very disappointed. I would rather have my chapstick in cherry flavor. Atleast It has a taste.
5,a must for missionaries,"While living in the Middle East I did a survey among missionaries living in a muslim environment, asking them what book had been most helpful in their preparations before coming over. This book was mentioned many times and had a great impact in their lives! As a teacher in a mission department of a christian seminary this book is a must for all students who consider going into missions. The book gives very good insights on the problem of cultural differences and shows clearly how your own faith has been effected by your culture. It also gives a very good model of contextualization which is applicable in all times and places. The examples Hiebert gives are practical and illustrate well the points he wants to make and make the book lively and accessible. Just read it!"
3,Required reading for a class,"I haven't gotten all the way through the book yet, but it's an okay read thus far. I may be a little biased as it was a required reading for a class."
2,A Dissappointment,"Based on the other reviews, I'd expected something really special. There's nothing wrong with the recipes and techniques in this book, but I learned nothing new. I already keep frozen mushrooms, herbs, onions, and peppers on hand. And the recipes for using those ingredients were fine, but again - nothing new. This would be a fine cookbook for a person who is just learning to freeze, or whose repetoire needs expanding. For the experienced cook - NOTHING NEW."
1,This Thing Drives Me Nuts!!!!!!,"I got this as a mother's day gift because my old Mr. Coffee was leaking. The Keurig makes me want to scream. For the last week I have followed the directions to the word and it won't work. It takes a minimum 4 tries to get a cup of coffee. I'm not really happy with the coffee either, there is a strong plastic taste to the drink. I thought that would go away after awhile. The other drawback is I can't find the K cups at any of the grocery stores, Sears carries them - yuck or mail order. I'm putting it back in the box and getting a regular coffee pot. Sorry fam I know you thought it was cool."
1,Nice to look at but thats all,I received this machine for my birthday on november 12. Today is december 6 and I just returned it to the store and got a new one. After about a week and a half it stopped making full cups of coffee. I thought it was just a fluke until it started sounding like an airplane was taking off on my kitchen counter. After reading all the negative things about keurig in general I am very happy this was a gift and I did not shell out 150 on a coffee maker that craps out in 2 weeks.
2,The Keurig Special Edition model is NOT recommended!,"The Special Edition model is NOT recommended!I recently purchased the Special Edition model as a replacement to my single serve Tassimo. I changed because my favorite Starbucks single serve coffee changed from the Tassimo to the Keurig. Well, after about 2-weeks of using the Keurig, I have found that the Special Edition Keurig is poorly designed. The water container is a joke, even with the larger 60 oz container. It is so oddly shaped that it is difficult to remove and impossible to replace on the unit without spilling some of the water.In addition, it seems like every cup of coffee tastes about the same. This was not the case with my old Tassimo. I have tried a few brands provided in the assortment pack and like the Starbucks coffees. However, all the Starbucks coffees taste the same and even different brand coffees all taste about the same.Very, very disappointed!"
1,Keurig makes THROWAWAY Products! THEY DO NOT REPAIR THEIR MACHINES!,"We bought this machine and enjoyed it for about two years, then it died. We called Keurig and were told THEY DO NOT REPAIR THEIR PRODUCTS. Instead, THEY OFFER TOKEN DISCOUNTS ON REPLACMENT MACHINES THEY WANT YOU TO BUY! There is no pride in the durability, servicability, or longevity of this product. Shame on Keurig management for a corporate philosophy of ""SORRY, WE DON'T PROVIDE SERVICE. BUY ANOTHER ONE!""The notion of throwaway products like this that end up in landfills in a world that is struggling to go green is mind-boggling. CORPORATE IRRESPONSIBILITY AND SHORTSIGHTEDNESS."
4,hoped for more,"Very convinent to use. As stated previopusly does not make strong coffee, but quick, easy and no mess clean-up. Perhaps the most irritating feature is that 7.5 ozs is not a lot of coffee, I find myself doubling up the brew cycle to fill my mug, easy to do with this machine - but doubling the cost. Still glad I got it."
5,Economical,"My autodrip required making (in my opinion) at least six cups to get the right flavor...anything less was too weak. I usually have two cups in the AM...and throw the rest away. Now I make it fresh when I want it, in 10% of the time and the coffee is better!"
2,Keurig B50,I have a Keurig B100 at home and absolutely love it. Decided to buy one for second home and went with the B50....ended up returning it because it was very loud and vibrated the counter when it fills the reservoir for the cup of coffee.I purchased the B100 instead. Excellent coffee maker!
2,"Fast, hot, weak.","I was excited to try this device. We were given it as a gift. I love a strong, smoky, deeply flavorful, natural cup of coffee in the morning. One that will hold up to the half and half, and one that's not ruined with synthetic flavors. My cup is a full 12 oz, but that's about it for the day.We have been using a french press and grind our our beans.I am quite disappointed in the final product with the coffee. Ease of use, to me, just ends up tasting like old fashioned weak vending machine coffee.What surprises me most, is that I guess I am the only one who has come to this conclusion."
4,Great coffee any time without brewing a pot,Great idea for any home or business where only a one or few cups of coffee are needed. K-Cup tea is very good too. Wish maker had larger cup portion. Also when dispensing just hot water you get residual from previous coffee/tea made. Overall would buy it again.
2,Dissatisfied,"I purchased the B60 model. I enjoyed the convenience and the flavor. It lasted less than a year. I was not able to solve the problem so that investment was wasted. I looked online in an attempt to remedy the situation and found many others with the same problem. Some had been able to resolve but none of the suggested solutions worked for mr, not even the one proposed by the guy who slaps his around. Reliability of this product deserves less than zero. $100. For a few months of coffee is a rip off."
2,wouldn't recommend it,"I got a Kurig coffee maker for Christmas. I was really excited. A few weeks later I found it often didn't work. The set up is not complicated yet I would tell it to brew and nothing would happen. I had to tell it to brew seven times this morning before it finally brewed my cup of coffee and overflowed the cup. If you have time to stand over it for an hour to make sure it works properly, feel free to get one. Otherwise, I plan to try the compitition. Additionally the coffee is expensive to buy."
2,Sincere ly Warning !!! A small piece of plastic in your coffee every time you make a cup,"Take a careful look, after the foaming dispear, a small piece of white plastic in your coffee every time you make a cup, I used it for 6 months right now, I am worry abount cancer now, I alway alway ptck this plastic out before I drink my coffee. good machine though except for this problem, I think Keurig need to fix it, otherwise somebody will sue them for $."
4,Keurig Brewing System,"Gave it as a gift on 11/25/05. It's still working. It's fast, efficient and easy maintenance. Several flavors can be purchased on-line or at stores such as Target."
1,Horrible customer service and Horrible Machine,Sure the machine is nice but it doesn't last over a year even if you take care of it. I had it 10 months and they would do nothing for me. It quite working and because it was manufactured 1.5 years previous there was nothing to be done. They don't account for the time that it sat on a shelf in the store. The product is low quality. Nice but low quality be prepared to buy multiple once you are addicted!!!
2,"machine works, coffee is not very good","The Keurig machines work well. I am accustomed to a double espresso of very good coffee. Tried several different k pods. Suspect they are putting a lot of robusta coffee in the pods. The coffee has a poor taste and it causes jangly nervies.It is a neat and handy system.Putting mine in storage when my Nespresso machine gets here.If you are picky about your coffee, advise looking elsewhere."
1,Before you buy...,"Quickly note that the ""large"" cup is 7 oz. While a more flavorful cup is 4 oz. Now look at how much coffee you normally drink. While I enjoyed the variety, the solution to getting a decent sized and decent tasting mug of coffee in the morning was to run one coffee pod on the large setting and one on the small. Great idea, poor execution."
1,UGH! Second machine stopped working too!,That is right second machine stopped working. This time only after two weeks! Sure we like the convenience but we are totally frustrated that it has stopped working. Same thing happened to both machines... stopped pumping water into the coffee and started pumping into the reservoir. UGH we are frustrated! At the price of the machine and the price of the coffee we will not be trying again.
4,Keurig b50,Super Quick brewing - coffee smells wonderful!! Hot perfect cup everytime! Extrememely low maintenance.
3,"History, history, history","This book presents an accurate, well-researched and well-written history of the Kabbalah, but the history portion is nearly 2/3 of the whole book. I bought it to learn about the Tree of Life and was very disappointed."
4,"Great, except for...","Fantastic children's Bible, however, the text is so tiny it almost hurts to read it. Pay the extra 13 bucks or so and get the bigger edition. This is filled with stories very well written so even a preschooler can understand and some great pictures my kids enjoy looking at."
3,Print to small for children,"the print and pictures are to small for a childs book, I had trouble seeing the print myself, I can't imagine a child being interseted in reading the material."
2,The print is microscopic!,"i ordered five of these for my grandkids because I saw an 8"" x 10.5"" book and the contents are great- it looked wonderful! BUT, when they arrived I was very disappointed to see the ones shipped are only 5 1/4"" x 6 1/2""! The print is so small that me and my husband both have to strain to read it, and I KNOW no children are going to have any interest in reading this either. The pictures are of course tiny also, so if it is being read to them, they won't be able to see much of those either. It is hard to explain how much difference this reduced size makes! The website does not show the size of the book. Who makes childrens books in what must be about a size 6 font? I feel like I wasted my money.For heavens sake put the size on your books!"
2,Size Matters!,"My daughters started at an Episcopal school this year. This was the required Bible for 1st grade. I saw the title, the author and ordered it. I wish I would have read the reviews then I would have learned it came in two sizes and Amazon doesn't carry the larger one, atleast not that I have found. I put my daughters name in it so that she could take it to school (so now I can't return it) and on the first day is when I realized the book came in two sizes and, of course, all the other children have the larger one. sigh. So I come back to Amazon, read the reviews I should have read the first time around and I really have to agree that the print is just too small for a small child and too small for her 40-something mother to read. It is full of color pictures, quality paper, binding, etc. But not a book that should have been printed in this size in the first place."
3,Print & illustrations too small.,"In this new smaller edition of the book, the text and illustrations are entirely too small--even for an adult. Book size approximately 6x7 inches. For this reason, I had to return the 8 copies I bought.This is a shame because the contents and illustrations are marvelous. I hope the editors will see fit to publish the book again in previous size which was approximately 8 1/2 x 10 inches. I have bought many copies in the past to give to children, teenagers, and even adults."
2,Shrunken version of original is WAY TOO SMALL!,"The original, much larger version of this Bible is excellent. However, this printing is way smaller. The text is so small it's barely readable. My 8 year old who is used to the other version started crying and needs a magnifying glass to read the text.Get the original, much larger version if you can."
2,"Link to the larger version of this book, the one you SHOULD buy!","Don't buy this size, here's a link to the larger size of this book so you can actually read the text:Children's Illustrated BibleFor some reason, when searching by title, Amazon doesn't pull the larger version of this book, only this mini-version. As many other reviewers have said, it's small. I don't think this is a book that should HAVE a mini-version. Just get the larger one, OK?!? :)"
1,Really too small,"Please believe the other reviews that say this version of this book is too small. Product dimensions say 6.8"" x 6.8"" but the copy I received is 5.5"" wide by 6.7"". The type is much too small to read comfortably. The content - when viewed with a magnifying glass - seems like some of the best I've seen and I've looked at quite a few children's Bibles recently. It simplifies the language of the Bible without speaking down to its younger audience. I'll be seeking out a larger version."
5,childrens bible,What a wonderful little bible for kids. We use it in homeschool and it is a very useful tool. It tells the story in a simplified way so younger kids can understand it better. We are very greatful that we found it.
3,type too small,"If this is intended for children, they should have considered the size of the type. It's smaller than what one finds in a phone book, and I don't know how any child could read it without having his eyes becoming weary. The look inside pages on the website are deceptive, as they show the type to be somewhat larger."
1,I do not hate the book,"I was not able to read the small print, I was wanting to read the book to the grand kids and help teach them to read"
1,Way too small!,"With the price, I naturally assumed this book would be a typical size hard back book however it is just slightly larger than a pocket size. The print is ridiculously small and I have perfect eye sight. Not at all pleased with this purchase."
1,Disappointing,"Although the text is wonderful, the print is so small that a child cannot read it. Actually, it's difficult for adults as well. There is a larger book, 'The Children's Illustrated Bible' that is sooo much better. However, on Amazon, I could NOT exchange this book. Buyer beware."
4,"Good Bible, except the type is very small","This is a good Bible for older elementary aged kids. There are great stories and illustrations as well as facts about life during biblical times. The only problem is the type face is really small, my guess is that it is about 6pt. type."
2,"1 star for size of type, 5 stars for everything else","I ordered this book because of the positive reviews and the ""fits in a child's hand size"" comments. What no one else mentioned is that the typeface is commensurately small--so small that it is a strain to my 42 year old eyes. By bedtime with my 2 and 6 year olds, I'll be so tired I likely won't be able to read the type. It is about the size of the small font used in paperback Penguins from the UK---about a 6-point on my computer's Times New Roman, where a 12 point TNR is the norm for letters. If you have strong eyes, the book is lovely, and it is an easily held size. The illustrations, contrary to somewhat lackluster reviews by some readers, were lovely. I plan to return the small version and will order the full size."
4,It's great except for some major spots...,"This is really a wonderful edition of Bible stories for children. However, the author ends up taking too many liberties with the text. The worst example is Jesus teaching the Lord's Prayer. He says, ""Our Lord in heaven."" Ack! It is ""Our FATHER"" and the difference is tremendously important. Many of the parables Jesus tells are introduced by saying something like ""Jesus told a story about the kingdom of heaven to say such and such..."" Many times the author's interpretation of the parable is debateable. These detract from the reading in my view, though a child would hardly notice. Discernment is called for by the parents! But the side notes and illustrations are very helpful and there are helpful articles on life in the various stages of Bible history times. A good Bible for bedtime reading (or any time really), but you may have to ad lib in some spots a more correct translation."
4,Beautiful but too small,"I purchased this book in the large picture book size a number of years ago. Recently, I wanted to buy one for my little grandson and was excited to find it on Amazon. I looked through the pages and was assured it was the same book so I purchased it. When it arrived I was disappointed to find it was reduced in size to a bit smaller than a hard bound novel. The beautiful illustrations, depiction of ancient tools, maps, etc which were so wonderful in my book were reduced to make them and the text very small and hard to see all the detail. I love the book and would recommend purchasing it for anyone interested in the teaching children bible stories and relevant history and life style of the times, but make sure you purchase the book that is large, not this reduced sized edition."
3,A bit small,"You can't tell from the image, but this book is quite small and it makes the font very difficult to read. I would have gotten a different version if I had known. A bible was requested by my 5 year old and I think the stories are a little advanced for her age. Wish I had researched more, but as it was from Santa I didn't return it..."
1,"college print, too small for young readers","We purchased this book for our granddaughter, which is 10 years old. the print is way to small for a young reader. The book measures 5 1/2 x 6 3/4. There is no way we can recommend this book . Very disapointed"
2,Children's illustrated bible,The Bible is great but I had to return due to the size. It is not clear how very small it is. I had to return and then look elsewhere to buy the larger version
1,Size of Bible was not listed on Amazon,The size of the Bible was not advertised with the product. I thought I was purchasing a larger size like the customer showed me she wanted. I did get permission to return them to the seller.
3,Small Book,"This is very small book which took me by surpise, but it seems nice, and it should be a great item to give as a baptismal gift."
1,fonts are too small for children to read,My children love the content but I can't let them read the book for too long.Double the size of the font and print it in a larger format would be better.
1,Undisclosed Minature,"I ordered this book based on one I had seen, 8"" x 10 1/4"", but the volume that arrived was a minature, ~5"" x ~6.5"". What a surprise! This book had print so small that I needed a magnifing glass in addition to my reading glasses to see the print. I was stunned with this minature version, the dimensions of which were never disclosed in the discription -- a terible disappointment. I am at a loss to understand why the publisher published this volume in an unacceptable size. My purchase was returned."
1,"Print is tiny, very hard to read. Don't buy it.",The printing is very very tiny. Less than 8 pt. Hard to read. Certainly not for children. I was very disappointed.
1,Children's Illustrated Bible,This edition was a fraction of the size of my own copy. It is not suitable to enjoy/share with others. It never occured to me to check the size of the hardback copy. Plan to return it and always look at size when ordering on line.
3,Be careful - don't mistakenly buy the small version,"This is a beautiful bible for young children to read on their own (ages 7 - 12) and for families with young children, unfortunately the one I purchased was 1/4 the size of the one I saw at Borders. I had no idea that the one I was buying was a small version and bought four of them as gifts. Needless to say, I was very sad when they arrived. The 1/4 size version is really small print. If you are buying the full sized version, I'd rate it a 5."
2,Too small,"The content and illustrations are wonderful, so it is a shame that they printed it in such a small size. The large amount of text and the small font make reading it laborious and that completely defeats the purpose, doesn't it? A larger size would have made all of the different and made this a perfect Bible for children!"
4,BEAUTIFUL BIBLE!,"The pictures in this book are GORGEOUS! I bought the book for a friends' son who had some questions. He's nine, still needs help with some words, but all in all BEAUTIFUL and worth it!!!"
1,PRINT & PICTURES ARE WAY TOO SMALL,"I expected a lot more from a DK book. I'm glad other people where able to read the book to find errors and likes. I could not. this book is way toooooo small to read. Children are used to larger print books(ME TOO). I am very disappointed in my purchase. I now see that the size is listed, but when I went into the ""LOOK INSIDE"" part on your site I could read it fine. This book is of no help to me.Update. I went to DK site and found that there is a bigger version of this book. I contacted Amazon and they found it and have exchanged the smaller book for the larger edition. It is very nice. Filled with information about and around the Holy Land. Thank you."
2,Interior layout and print not child friendly,I ordered this book and was disappointed in the confusing layout of the pages. It was cluttered with many side bars. This makes it difficult for young readers to gather information on a page. The print is too tiny. You need a magnifier!
1,Too Small,"I saw this bible at a bookstore, but didn't buy it because it was less expensive on Amazon. I didn't realize that this bible was miniature compared to the full sized bible at the bookstore. Granted, I should have looked at the dimentions of the book before purchasing, but I think the size was misleading to the purchaser on the website. I would not purchase this book again, and will probably return this one. Very disappointed."
4,Very good,"Surrender Dorothy is a very good must hear. Alana's cover of ""The Reaper"" is an unusual choice that ends up working well into the album. It was a track I often place on repeat. ""Wide Open"" is another strong cut the emphasizes Alans'a talent for writing and utilizing her voice to come across to her listeners."
5,On par with Blame It On Me and better than Fortune Cookies,"After a funky split with Elektra, Alana has come back full force with an album full of integrity and soul. She's gotten away from some of the synthesized sounds on her last album and gone mostly acoustic for Surrender Dorothy. The new album showcases her sultry voice with great new songs that haven't been touched by industrial interests. The song Right There will make you want to call your best friend and Letter will make you smile. Her version of The Reaper (originally by Blue Oyster Cult) had me setting the repeat button on my stereo. Those of you who were a little disappointed by Fortune Cookies (including myself) will find redemption in Surrender Dorothy. Congratulations Alana on a comeback well done."
2,Limited help.,The book covers J2EE 1.3 security with hello-world level security examples beyond I find nothing but an introductory Java Security API guide. The chapters also lack details on when and where you should use these APIs. I bought this book before 'Core Security Patterns' by Christopher Steel that is much more helpful and example driven than this book.
2,Misleading title - Absolute mess,"This book is titled wrong and absolute mess. This books claims coverage on building robust J2EE security - But unfortunately it lacks and missing a lot of J2EE security features. Particularly There is no discussion on how to adopt role based security, propogating security at all tiers, JAX-RPC and EJB Endpoint security and so on. This book only offers a very basic level of securing a J2EE application beyond that YOU WILL BE BORED TO TEARS."
4,Greatly extends the versatility of your bath-tub.,"I'm sure you've all been in the same position. You really want to wash your feet, but only a fully run bath will do. Well that's where this little beauty comes in. You can sit back comfortably, supported securely above water-level, safe in the knowledge that your feet alone are being cleansed.Rumour has it that an accompanying foot stool is in development, allowing consumers to enjoy the pleasure of a long soak without the inconvenience of actually getting wet."
1,Do not buy it just to see Linda Blair,Poor action movie and Linda is more like an extra than a main player. She has maybe 15 minutes of on-screen presence and she is never close to nude.Only buy if you get into GRADE B 80's movies.
5,Must-read!,"It is not often that I have to put down a book and return to it a few days later because the events were too upsetting. How could she have done that to Stephen? (What more can I say without giving away the story?) While at times a bit slow, I thouroughly enjoyed this book. But what happens to Kallandras now?"
3,Absolutely Mediocre,"Well, West managed to keep me hooked to the end, but the book didn't leave me with much of an impact. Missing was the humor of a Weis/Hickman book, the moral teachings of a Lloyd Alexander work or the drama of a Tad Williams book. The constant shift in viewpoint wore on me and took away from the drama rather than helping to build it. The setting is somewhat interesting, but the characters are mainly bland. Some, like Jewel, are interesting, but many are one-dimensional and utterly predictable. Ms. West puts in a few surprises and plot twists, which help out, but can't salvage the book from being totally average. I wouldn't recommend you buy this, but nor would I recommend you not to buy it. Maybe the best example of your average fantasy paperback."
3,Missing pages....,Wonderful fantasy story. I read the first book and then started the second last week. I was reading last Thursday night and had planned to finish the book that night... but??? pages 513 through 548 were missing !! I have returned the book but I am afraid to order a new one. Hope no one else has this problem.
1,Imposter,"Plain and simple the guy singing is not Piporro, but a very close impressionist that almost gets it right, but a few singing slip ups out the truth."
3,Waiting for the World to end! (extra credit!) by: Autumn,"The book, ""Waiting for the World to End"" had its high points and low points. The story is a little dragged out threw some parts and can be a little boring. The characters in the story made me mad with some of the things they did. Overall the book mad me upset, but it keeps you reading to find out if the characters turn out happily ever after!"
5,Excellent Novel!,"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. I was assigned to read this book for my English class. I thought that it would be one of those ""boring"" books, in which i would lose intrest in right away. But when I picked up this book and started reading, it caught my attention immeadiately; I was hooked. I could not put the book down. The plot has so many twists and turns, that I would defintely recommend it to any one. I am not a big ""book"" person, but this is one that you definately must read."
4,"""BigBird The Blessed Knight of Earyldor""","""Waiting For the World to End"" was a very inspiring book. It had many mysterious and exciting parts. From the first word to the last word of the book I was sucked into the black hole of brilliance that this book contained. The character Tom Olsen was just a regular guy until he met the woman of his dreams. In a way I feel like I am Tom Olsen because in some spots of my life I struggled almost exactly in the way that Tom did. This surprised me because even though the book was fiction, it should really be non-fiction because of the creative and close relation of events that took place in the book. To me I feel as if I am just like or related to Tom Olsen because some of the things that took place during his life could have or I thought would have taken place in my life. The climactic point of the book was when Ben got hurt. An evasive point of the book was the fact that nobody ever knows why Tom Olsen's parents treat him in a supercilious way."
4,Even got me Interested,"When we were told that we were going to have to read this book in English class, my first thought was that I was going to have to read another book that I would never be able to get into. Once I started the first chapter I realized that I was actually interested in the book. I liked the fact that some of the major events and settings happened in my hometown. I liked this book and would recommened it to just about anyone, because if it was able to get me interested, then it should be able to get many other people interested too."
1,Not my Cup of Tea,"I must admit I was not very interested in the book. I thought the author made Tom out to be this disgusting pig, who went for a married woman. I do have my dislikes about this book, but I did have a favorite part of the book and that was the ending. Waiting for the World to End just wasn't a book that I would tell someone else to read because it was boring and didn't really make me want to turn the page. I could have actually put the book down and not worry about what happened at the end. I look at this book as a really bad soap on television."
4,This was definitely top 5 in my fav. book category,"I thought this book taught me a lot about life, love, and the everyday challenges. This book also taught me about the good and or bad choices any person on any given day make. All in all I liked this book, although I thought at times that Olsen was being selfish and stubborn with the choices he made. The ending was the most surprising because it is not really what I expected to happen, but it was still a good book and I enjoyed reading it."
4,waiting for the world to end,"In the book ""Waiting for the World to End"" you will encounter with very interesting characters. You get to dive into the life of Tom Olsen and see that he's not as happy as what many people around him think he is. You will also leaarn about his personality and his addictions. The book manages to keep you interested the whole time because you can never tell whats going to happen next."
3,"""Waiting for the World to End"" well written","In ""Waiting for the World to End"", Tom Olsen is a middle-aged high school English teacher and basketball coach. He has never married and is haunted by the abortion he and his first fiance had 20 years earlier. He gets through daily life by not caring about much and having a beer or 2 every day. He meets his star player's mother, Mary, and instantly falls head over heels for her. He can never have her. His dream could become a reality, though, after a secret her husband Virgil has been harbouring coms out 3 quarters of the way through the book. It has many fate-determining events throughout the book and it never really loses your attention. The plot and characters were very well written and developed. It isn't, however, a favorite of mine."
3,The Long and Short of It,"The book was good in my opinion, but there were some things about the book I didn't understand. For the most part I got the general idea of the book. That the world will end for people but you have to live life to the fullest. Waiting for the World to End has a few good parts but the best for instance, was when the accident at Valparaiso happened because it showed true emotion and how much Olsen cared for Ben. What I didn't understand is what hapens to Virgil since the author already made him divorce Mary. It's also good though because the end of the book is like a cliffhanger leaving the end of the book open. Since the author left questions open at the end she will probably write another book."
2,Disappointing Ending,"""Waiting for the World to End"" starts slow but soon turns captivating. I was a little disappointed in how Ms. Hunter chose to end the book. Other than the ending, it was a good book and I recommend it for reading. Ms. Hunter uses great sensory details and her descriptions are outstanding."
2,Review,"I had neutral feelings torwards this book. I didn't hate it, but I didnt like it. I thought the book was rather boring and was hard for me to get into. I did like how the story was easy to understand and follow. I do like that about books. I did not like how the book ended. In all the book wasn't bad but it was not my kind of book I would chose to read."
2,"Story might be okay, but the grammar is hopeless",The writer's much tortured syntax made me nauseous!!! It's worse than George W. Bush's. I could not finish reading the book because of the bad writing.
4,Life Lessons,"Waiting for the World to End, in essence, is what we all are doing. Nicole Hunter has an amazing book full of intrigue, mystery, and fasination. Having only lived for eighteen years and reading this book I've found I can relate to almost every aspect, especially Ben. His character has helped me grow in ways I didn't even know I could, from a book. Mary and Tom's relationship has made me question those whom I feel close to and respect in their perception of me. The life lessons that were discussed in this book can have a real barring on today's culture and society. It can especially help concentrate on the morals and values of life in the twenty-first century and even life as a whole."
4,Good Book,"This book was very good. Considering its the only book I ever read, I really enjoyed it. The ending was a little dissappointing but left more for the reader to think about. This book also has a lot of lessons to be learned in it. One thing I learned from the book is that you cant dwell on the past. You cant keep thinking what if or if only. You need to move on and think about the future because you cant change the past, but you can change what happens in the future."
4,Waiting for the sequel!!!,"In the novel, ""Waiting for the World to End"", you get sucked into a different world. A world where you feel as if you are living your everyday life with the characters of the book. The main character Tom Olsen, the all-star basketball coach, goes through many stages in his life. Tom knows many people and most think he lives the perfect life. When he's helping everyone , no one else realizes he's sturggling a lot with his own . If you can relate to many things such as love, lust, denial, sports, and joy, then this should be a novel that is on your list to buy next time your at the bookstore. Nicole Hunter is a brillant writer that always keeps you on your feet and guesssing what's going to happen next."
5,Captivating,"""Waiting for the World to End"" is a great book. I am not the type of person who enjoys reading books AT ALL, but this one caught my attention. I really liked the fact that it dealt with basketball and took place here in Indiana. Even though the book was fiction, so much of it seemed like it was real. The conflicts the characters faced were problems that people face every day and it makes you feel like you can relate to them. It also has a suprise factor at times. Some of the events seem to be predictable, but then others aren't. So, it keeps you guessing through most of the book. The end was a little disappointing to me, but I'll let you determine that for yourself."
3,Great work,"The book Waiting For the World to End was a very good book. I enjoyed reading about what Nicole Hunter imagined. I think she did a very good job. She made me want to keep on reading. She doesn't just concentrate on just one subject, there are so many conflicts that happen in the book. There was always something new going and which made me want to keep on reading, she definitely caught my attention! The only thing is that, I wish she would have told us what happened with Tom and Mary, whether they were still friends and talked or never talked again after he told her how he felt. In her book she taught me a lot about life lessons and how I can be so lonely but yet live life to the fullest. Nicloe Hunter's book was awesome and one I will cherrish forever."
4,A good story,"Easy to read, yet challenging to understand. This is a good story and an enjoyable read. Plenty of thought provoking interplays between characters. The personalities and thoughts of the characters are very well developed and continue to reveal themselves throughout the book. You will feel like you have entered their world in no time at all.Well worth your time."
1,falta mas especificaciones,buenas tardes deberian informar mas sobre el producto por ejemplo si vienen los 2 cilindros cuantas llaves trae si tienen un combro con cilindros y swichera ser mas especificos en cuanto al producto se refiere
3,Misses the point,"I bought this video one week before traveling to Darfur. I have now returned and after speaking with the victims and the recently freed slaves, I learned a few things.The problem with this video and most books on the subject that that they intentionally don't talk about the reasons for the killing. It is Arab Muslims killing and enslaving Black Muslims because once the blacks asked for some power for self-governance, the Arab muslums no longer looked at them as Muslims but sub-human. You see many of the same enemies in the War on Terror involved in Darfur (Which is really Western Sudan.) Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia financially supporting the government in Khartoum with China buying the oil and Russia supplying the planes and bombs.The reason why George Clooney and others omit these facts is because if they did, they would have to admit George W. Bush was right about Iraq. Darfur is what Iraq WILL look like if we leave too early!"
3,Back story to advocacy movement.,"I thought this was an interesting insight into how a well-known personality (such as George Clooney) can do something under the radar and show up to greatly enhance awareness for an advocacy movement. In this documentary we realize that George Clooney and his father went unannounced to Darfur to ""shine a light"" (a camera's light)on the genocide. Moreover, they were trying to make it back to the USA with images from Darfur BEFORE a planned rally in Washington DC. Besides hearing refugees interviewed, I found myself wondering: What if George Clooney had never gone? What if he didn't make it back in time before the rally? What if he and his father hadn't done a ton of media interviews?"
1,Too fictionalized,"If you're looking for a reasonably truthful account of the flamboyant criminal career of Jack ""Legs"" Diamond, my advice would be to skip this book. Sam Curzon, the author, creates characters (such as the nurse, Mary Bogan, with whom Legs supposedly had an affair) who simply never existed, and the dialogue contained in these pages is questionable at best. Certain names, dates and places are factual, but in my view this book contains an unacceptable amount of misinformation, far too much for any serious student of the Gangster Era."
3,Not bad,I bought these for the cost and for the reason of sending video letters to my boys. I found they hold up well and they aren't to bad unlike others that charge a arm and a leg to get only three. I like these cause of the cost and the amount you get. Thats why I wou8ld buy more when I need to.
5,TDK,"I ordered these for our farm party so my cousin could video it for me. Since she was the one using the DVDs I can't really comment on the quality, other than I heard her say they seemed to be working well. So, since the videos turned out okay, I'm assuming they're fine DVDs."
3,A reall funny man,"I bought 3 of Curt Brummett's books: WELCOME TO QUERECHO FLATS, SNAKE IN THE BATHTUB and ROPING CAN BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH. In truth, I was looking for two cassette tapes Mr. Brummett made years ago that were soooo funny they brought tears to the eyes and sore belly muscles to any one who listened to them. We were truck drivers back then and literally had to park the 18 wheeler on the side of the road until we stopped laughing and cleared our eyesight. We took those tapes on vacation with our grandkids to help entertain them on the long rides and again had to stop the rocking car until we all stopped laughing and kicking so we could continue. The tapes finally wore out and I can't find them anywhere so I bought his books. They are funny, but they haven't had the same impact as the tapes. The stories he tells are wonderfully funny, I guess you'd call them, cowboy humor."
3,Good For Novices,"I am a music major. My instruments are jazz guitar,piano, and voice. I've been studying music for years and I am currently at the university. I purchased this a few years ago when I was at the beginning stages of jazz improvisation. This DVD is helpful, but I wish it was longer and provided more insights about music theory and jazz guitar. Every one has a personal opinion, but personally, there are other DVD's and books that are better. A really good book is Jody Fishers Jazz Guitar. It is detailed and provides a practice CD.If you are a beginner or an experience player who just wants to learn basic theory without having to attend a class or read a book, this DVD will do the job just fine."
4,"sublime, as usual","I would have to guess that ""East of the Night"" is Micus's ode to dawn, both in the literal and contemplative senses of the word. First, there's the title: What comes, after all, 'east of the night'?--well, sunrise, of course (think about it for a moment...). Then there's the music itself. The two twenty minute plus works that make up the album are primarily guitar pieces, but they are played on 10- and 14-string guitars, respectively, and after an initial eruption (just like sunrise) drift dreamily along with lots of notes played in the lowest register (a reflection of hypnogogic imagery?). The second piece is a solo work, but in the first the guitar is accompanied by a flute that provides just the perfect airy, and sometimes dancing, meditative complement. I'm not sure this is one of Micus's best efforts overall, but if you like any of his others you will surely like this one too. Score this one a '4 plus.'"
2,Cannot recommend,"The headphones are comfortable enough. Not quite as nice as the photo suggests. The actual headphones differ, slightly smaller/cheaper looking.The headphones cut out some low frequency hum, but in doing so add hiss.My main hope was that I could protect my ears and listen to a portable mp3/radio while doing chores such as mowing the lawn or vacuuming.They help a little, but the volume is boosted when the ANC is activated so it's difficult to know if the improvement is due to ANC or higher volume."
4,A disturbing book about a miscarriage of justice,"I like to read crime books in which, at the end, justice has been done, but such is not the case in Jim Schutze's *By Two and Two*. It tells the story of two Alabama sisters charged with conspiring to murder the husband of one of them. Although apparently neither woman was involved in the crime, one was found guilty and the other was not, because of personal, social and racial issues tangential to the case. In pursuing the investigation, well-meaning police were evidently manipulated and deceived by a career criminal who sought, and won, preferential treatment by helping them make a case against the women. The author himself was clearly disturbed by the outcome"
2,No Clue to what happened or how,"Schutze has no clue as to what happened or how. He has been swayed. There is a new book coming in mid 2004, it tells who, what, when, how and why. You just might be suprised!"
1,"Worthless, do not order","This is not a replica of the original. It is just the text, extracted from a scan by OCR. It has been re-set in a small, modern font to fit on as few pages as possible. It does not include the ""Fifty Fine Copperplate Diagrams"" that were in the original.The OCR has many errors that were uncorrected, for example: ""SUFFICIENT KNORFLEfOB <<DAN Bg ApQUIRE$ TO ENABLE THE"". These errors often make it very difficult to puzzle out what the authors intended and the lack of diagrams makes it impossible.In the product, the publishers acknowledge that there are typos and no diagrams but the missing diagrams are not mentioned in the product description on Amazon.A bad product -- do not buy."
4,Sara's Surprise,It was a good book. Deborah Smith always has good character development and a happy ending. A treat these days.
3,Not my usual cup of stuff,"I love Deborah Smith, but decidedly prefer her more general stories. As straight-up froth romance goes this is unique and romantic. But it has the typical keep-secrets-from-your-lover conflict device that turns me off."
4,better than expected,Tasted better than I expected. Pretty low calorie too. I eat these at work when I'm too busy to walk down to the microwave. Heats well - just pour water on the pad in the box. Comes with soup which I've never eaten but the cookies are good.
4,Nice CD,"Pleasant compilation;I think I've heard some better Jobim performances elswhere, but it's still very enojable..."
4,i haven't tried a lot but i liked this one,it doesn't dry quick...but i guess since its water based it doesn't feel that much of...slippery but i like it! n ill buy more. however i wanna try that KY one before i buy this product again
2,This,"Very sticky. Don't buy. I'm picky so this might work for others, but trust me there are better lubricants available."
4,toy,This product has a nice scent to it. It also last for a very long time. Was very please with it's performance. Would recommend this product to others.
5,great,not much to say on this but its lube theres no smell which was good other wise it did its job and would def order again
4,Fun time is fun!,"I got this a while ago and have been using it. Love it, it doesn't take much at all and it washes away easily from unwanted places. If I need more lubricant there is a very good possibility I'll be getting another bottle of this stuff."
5,Small but hilarious,What a quick shipper. Had a basket of items for a bachelor party and the icing was this little bottle.
4,work as intended,"ID glide personal lubricant works as intended, but gets sticky after short period of use, then becomes a distraction. we actually use this product when we cant find the KY brand lube."
5,Wooo Hoooo!,It works just great! Thanks to this magic potion my girlfriend is willing to go places no man has gone before! Super slippery goop that we're both enjoying a ton.
5,Sharpe's Trafalgar,"Cornwell's work never stops amazing me. One would think - a battle is a battle. However, this author pulls you on the ship, down into the hold, on the deck, up the tall sails, and into the arms of a lover. He fills the reader with knowledge of the times we would otherwise never possess."
3,Not his best,"I dont enjoy reading books out of historical sequence, and I think BC struggles to find Sharpes Sea legs on this one - still a great read but not as enjoyable as the land based Sharpe's with his riflemen. I think BC tried too hard to simply get the Battle of Trafalgar as one of the stories in his series. But if you are a BC fan you will still enjoy."
2,Sharpe's Trafalgar,"Although I am a fan of Mr Cornwall and have read almost all his books and own the entire Sharpe Series,I did not enjoy this book. Cornwall is one of my favorite authors but I was disapointed. Instead of the normal two three or more battles in a Sharpe book, there was one. The battle although good was not spectacular, I have read better in books by CS Forester, Dewey Lambdin, and Alexander Kent. Too much of the book was devoted to Sharpe's romance with a high born lady. The book in general was just not up to Cornwall's usual excellant standards. In conclusion I say boo."
1,Cornwell is losing his touch,"Sad to say Cornwell is losing his touch. He's still trying to get as much money out of the ""Sharpe"" character as possible. To do this, he puts Sharpe in just about every battle of the Napoleanic Wars. If you've read the previous Sharpe books, or watched the films, you'll be disappointed with this book. There are even some rumors that Sharpe will see action at New Orleans in 1815 (Sharpe's 'Gator) which is a MAJOR stretch. What next Mr. Cornwell; Sharpe Goes to the Alamo ? If you MUST read this one, check it out at your local library, but I don't recommend buying it."
4,another winner,...along with all the Sharpe's stories (as well as the majority of Cornwell's other books) this character is mesmerizing and coupled with wonderful story lines is a joy to read.
4,The next Patrick O'Brian?,"Like some of the reviewers, I felt that it started much too slowly for a Sharp's adventure and I also felt that it had far too much on his love(?) interest. The last 1/3 or so was equal to his other books but I get the feeling that Cornwell has generated a book to prove to his agent or to his publishers that he can write ""sea stories"" to take up the Patrick O'Brian flag. We will all need to wait to see if Sharp fights his next battle on land, sea, or in the bed room!"
4,Classic Yello,"This a solid recording but most of the songs can be found on 'The New Mix In One Go, Yello 1980-1985' which I consider a better purchase and certainly a better introduction to Yello. However, the track 'Desert Inn' is excellent and is not included in 'The New Mix..'For the interest of one of the other reviewers - the bonus track 'Oh Yeah - Indian Summer Version' has been put on CD before. Yello issued a limited edition CD singles box set of 3000 copies back in 1988. The five singles were:Let Me Cry (4.15)/ Haunted House (4.28)Oh Yeah (Dance Mix)(6.25)/ La Habanera (5.10)/ Oh Yeah (Indian Summer Version)(5.30)Goldrush I (6.31) / Goldrush II (6.12) / She's Got A Gun (Live at the Palladium N.Y.)(4.20)Tied Up In Red (8.28)/ Wall Street Bongo (3.05) / Tied Up (6.05)The Race (13.22)/ Another Race (Magician's Version for Tempest + Cottet)(3.42)"
5,"""Stella! STELLA!"" ~ Oh Yeah...","It is about time they issued remastered versions!This was the album that introduced me to this dynamic duo and still one of my favorites. It was the first to feature the much used Oh Yeah, but has a ton of other great material on it as well. If you are looking to get aquainted with them or or a fan from way back that still has the vinyle albums, there now is a good time to 'upgrade' your collection.BTW, the Indian Summer remix of Oh Yeah was a vinyl only release until now, to the best of my knowledge."
3,Wrong Bonus Tracks,"The Yello reissue series has been out for a while. The sound is a great improvement from the previous CD editions, but there are surprisingly few reviews written on them applauding this fact. One possible reason is that too much was left out in terms of bonus material, and as a result it leaves you wanting more.Here on their 4th album Stella, the track labelled ""Vicious Games 12"""" is in fact not even the UK 12"" version, but a rather toned down mix based on the album version. Ever wondered when they would put vinyl-only stuff like the Vicious Remix on CD?"
4,An interesting perspective,"Dungan presents a desription of the history of the canon of the New Testament from the perspective of the political process. He does define the term canon in a way that will cause thought, but it worth the careful read. He does not totally accept the view that Constantine directed the canon process, but does acknowledge some role."
3,"A facinating read, but in the end...","Dungan's personal objectives are clear and the result is perhaps less than obvious. He has well documented the capstone of Christian apostasy - the victory of politics over revelation; philosophical expediency over apostolic authority... the victory of Constantine, the 'supreme governor of the world' (Eusebius)over the bickering bishops of decaying Christendom. Alas... the beat goes on."
3,"To much theory, for me.","I'm a (relatively) beginner in VBA and I like learning by examples. Guy Hart-Davis promises dirty hands early in the book, but reading close to 200 pages before staring with codes is not my game. For me this book has too much theory. But for students or others that already has been working with VBA it's probably a great book. I will probably pick this book up later."
4,Fairly well made,"I bought this to replace a leaking hose end on a Major brand 3/4"" hose. According to the product description it should work for a 3/4"" hose. In reality, it works on a 3/4"" hose but not great. There is still a little bit of water that leaks by. I'm talking drops, not streams or spray leaking by. The product is fairly well made and easy to install. Make sure you have a nice clean squared off cut on your hose before attempting. I am pretty happy with it, but can't give it 5 stars due to the leaking. I cut reseated it and cut the hose 3 times to try and fix it and have decided the problem is in the clamping. With only two screws there is just no way to get an even clamp on it to completely eliminate leakage."
4,A quality hose coupling,It seems every year I have to repair a hose. I have been looking for a quality hose coupling that will last. Here is one that cannot go wrong.
5,Does the Job: A Metal Garden Hose Coupler,"This cost-effective metal male coupler does a fine job for repairing a hose, or making multiple shorter hoses from a longer one you no longer need. The screws do a fine job of holding the coupler on the hose tightly. They have none of the problems with minimum cost plastic couplers that may strip when tightened enough to stop a leak or come off the hose when pulled across your lawn."
5,Good quality,Very nice quality and a good price. Easy to install. I would buy it again (and probably will at some point).
4,Very useful directory book,"This is definitely a very useful book. It meets the expectations based on the book description.But I returned it: it's only for the American market as the most companies listed are in the USA. So if you don't live in the USA, it won't meet your expectations.One of the downsides of this book is the price/quality ratio: You'll get the feeling that you've bought a small part of the yellow pages, but with some extra information. There are no images (or at all in this book) of the fabrics you want to deal with, so after you've found your potential fabric or any other company, you still have to go on investigation on the internet about the company.Hope this review was useful to you."
5,A new format for a great story,"As I am getting older I find it, sometimes, difficult to return to joys of old.What I'm driving at is, there are many of us , veterans of WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and even some of the more recent conflicts, who for one reason or another, find it troublesome to read the printed word. So what I would like to ask you to do is to see if you and others like you could stimulate publishers to put this book on an audio disc and help us old guys out who would like to reacquaint ourselves with this great book again.Thanks for the venue.Paul F. Condon, MD"
5,Absolutely The BEST military book I have yet to read,"I cannot add much to the other reviews but as a young LT entering into today's US Army, I was completed amazed at the lessons taught in this book. The author has managed to show the reader two of the leadership styles that exist in today's military, and how each of them worked/didn't work for the characters. A ""MUST READ"" for any leader of troops!"
5,WELL DONE!,This is by far the best book I have read. I remember watching the movie years ago and would love to see it again. Sam Damon personifies all the traits that should be commonplace in todays military but is pushed aside by political agenda. I have my own copy that I encourage my Sailors to read.
2,A Lame View of History,"If you want to read about what war in the 20th Century was really like, do not read this book. This book is war-lite, an attempt by a novelist of limited means to create an unrealistic hero who is never wrong in his decisions. Readers of this novel will be edified in no way: the main character is a cardboard cut-out of what Army officers should be, and his antagonist is portrayed as an effete snob. If you want propaganda reading material, read this novel. That's why the Army/USMC likes it so much: it stresses the core values of the modern military. This novel fails in every attempt to create real characters in real situations: the main character, Sam Damon, is a man who does no wrong (and we all know how false a premise that is). If you want to read about what WW2 was really about, pick up something by Wolf Heckman."
1,It's boring. The dialog is insipid.,"If you are in a position in the military where you are forced to read this book and you wonder why you find it boring when so many others love it, you may rest assured that it truly is boring. I slugged it out to page 137 in the 938 page hardcover version and I give up. I cannot stand to hear another word from that corny character named Raebyrne. Here are the problems with this book. The dialog is insipid. The character development is shallow, much like the science fiction genre. There is not much action. It is a pokey, slow moving book that offers little else except perhaps a depiction of military life and action that is accurate enough to please those who have been there. I have not been in the military, but I have enjoyed many books on military history that are far more stimulating than this novel. If you love this book, fine. If you don't love this book, you are not alone."
2,"Please, No...","Courtney Massengale is a douchebag, Sam Damon is the hero. Got it all. In one sentence. Not about a thousand pages or so. Bleah. Damon also takes too much crap from Massengale, can't police his zipper and doesn't kick his cheatin' wife Tommy to the curb. Mind-numbingly dull and long for a saintly martyr of a hero who could be improved. If you're picking this off a professional development reading list, pick Starship Troopers instead (it's shorter, actually entertaining and more informative)."
5,Hands down best book I have ever read.,"I will never understand how I grew up reading all the great soldiering/adventure books I could get my hands on, and managed to never discover this gem. This book is one of those few ""must read"" books every young man should be required to read. Sam Damon's life, albeit fictional, is one that exemplifies what it truly means to serve. The takeaways from this book are unrivaled. Sam's advice to ""always choose to be a good human being, versus always choosing to remain a good soldier"" represents the precise sentiment I feel so many other great books have fallen short at. I plan on reading this book every 5 years or so throughout my life to keep me grounded and remind myself what life is all about. I sincerely hope every other person who reads this book embraces the one-of-a-kind messages found within these pages."
3,Could have been better,"It is a good story and the writing starts off good and clear but when it gets to the battle scenes, the abstract, jumbled up what is going on starts, and the author assumes (I guess) that the reader understands french and North Carolina hilly billy isms, I know about 3 french words and thats it, the phrases that Raebyrne the North Carolinian comes with were for the most part beyond my figuring out what he was trying to say, I like to know and understand what is going on in a story, perhaps most readers just skim thru it and see the ""big picture"", every marine has to read this book?, how do they know that they did? are they given a test?, an edited version omitting the gibberish would suit me far better."
3,Almost a classic,"Do not be deceived by the praises heaped on this novel by military officials: it is not nearly that good. It is a passable foray into the minds of two military men, but it is also about 300 pages too long. No reader who is unfamiliar with U.S. military history ""insider knowledge"" will understand why the two main characters are so diametrically opposed in their approach to life in the military/warfare. The book is more of an inside joke than a story, but only Army brass would get it. If you've never been in the military, this book will mean very little to you and disappoint you. If you've been in the military, you'll understand what's going on and wonder why nobody in charge learned anything from reading it. I've been in the military and think it's a boring book with occasionally interesting sections. Myrer is dead, so save yourself the cash and read ""Red Badge of Courage."" You'll enjoy it more."
5,great,amazing product perfect delivery time. Everything was good about this product i would highly recommend buying this bok as soon as you can
5,Must Read,"This is a must read for all officers in the US Military; it covers the horrors of combat, the trials of married life, the issues with command and inept commanders, and everything that a leader will face in their career. My personal motivaitonal phrase is now Sam Damon (read the book and you'll find out why)."
4,Firehouse fun!,"As an educator, I absolutely adore the inclusiveness portrayed in this book. So many books today which include characters with a disability, spend so much time trying to teach about a specific disability, or trying to impart a message of acceptance, that they forget the storyline. This certainly can't be said about Russ' books. If it weren't for the pictures, we wouldn't even know that Russ has Down syndrome and that's exactly how I like it- disability naturally."
1,A dissppointment,Our neighbor across the street has a little girl with downs syndrome and my daugther who is 4 has started to notice that she is different from her. I wanted to get her a book that showed someone with downs syndrome doing real things so that I could use it as an example. Unfortuntately the pictures are so far away that you don't really get to see Russ. It would have been better if there were some closer photographs.
5,Works of Tarkay beautifully illustrated,"This book has 160 pages of biography and beautiful pictures of Tarkay's works. The first 44 pages are mostly pictures of Tarkay living and painting. The rest of the book from p. 45 to p. 160 is filled with his beautiful works of art, many full page size.This is a book that every lover of Tarkay should have in their collection. It is not definitive of all of his works but certainly has a lot of them, many of which the Tarkay collector will recognize."
1,NOT about mindfulness mediation,"I bought this book during a search for books about mindfulness meditation and living a mindful life and that is not what this book is about. It describes 10 steps to emotional prosperity. I am always looking for new perspectives, so even though it wasn't on the topic I thought I started to read it anyway. The language is so difficult - highly abstract and intellectualized - that I stopped after the second chapter.Maybe it's for you, but it sure wasn't for me."
5,"Pihkal, truely a love story with one's work.","I thought this book very infomative and educational.It gives great insight to DR.Shulgin & his wifes life work.A must read for any aspiring chemist.This book cuts away all the propaganda surrounding many of these recreational compounds and chemicals. The facts and nothing else.Educate yourself, knowledge is always your friend."
4,Pihcal: a chemical love story,"A very interesting book, with something for everyone, from chemists to the curious. Rarely have I seen a book published on the subject with such scientific objectivity, yet it is still filled with anecdotes that are very interesting and fun to read. I enjoyed every page"
5,Could the author have Asperger's?,Having only read the excerpt - the flavor of the writing and some of the author's interests - seem similar to that / those of people with Asperger's syndrome. Could these pharmaceuticals be helpful in ameliorating the emotional flatness associated with disorders on the autistic spectrum?
3,Started so brilliant... went downhill dramatically...,"The first half of this book is excellent. It tells us about the chemists life and how he discovered exciting new drugs. It also tells us about his experiences taking them.The second half is terrible. It is written by his wife and it is a love story. She has to be the most pathetic person I have ever come across. I don't know how anyone can be so needy and insecure. The amount of times I cringed at her ""inner thoughts"" (written in italics in the book). Agh. It really ruined the book.Overall, I recommend this book because the first half is so good. Maybe I'm too cynical and you might enjoy the second half, but I doubt it..."
4,Greeat,"Haven't finished. First part is a autobiography, second part is a synthesis and Shulgin's reactions to the chemicals he experimented with. Larger than you'd expect, but thats cause its basically 2 books in one."
2,Decent observations but long winded!,"This book is long! Even though half of it is chemical breakdowns of almost every type of drug. Not bad but very long winded towards the end, found myself flipping just to interesting parts. Was hoping for some insight into DMT but found nothing. I guess this is good for your basement chemist but not to good for any insights into the expansion of the mind."
1,Useless with current edition of PSP,This book is useless.Sony's 3000 series PSP cannot be hacked to do what author writes about.This book was good in its day...now it's just something to put in the fireplace as obsolete / worthless.
3,PSP Hacking Book,"This is an alright book depending on how much you are into your psp. I would recommend it to an extreme psp player, but not an everyday average psp player."
3,Not for programmers,"Despite the obvious reference to programming in the title (alas, the term ""hacking"" has been used for much less worthwhile pursuits lately), the book contains very little with respect to writing applications for PSP. Instead, it's largely devoted to electronic and aesthetic ""hacks"" - like making a PSP holder for your car.The book barely touches on development, only mentioning the toolkit and a few installation steps, which makes its title a lot less meaningful."
4,Lots of interesteing info.,"Even if you think you know it all, you're bound to learn something here. Some of the info is pretty basic, but there's a lot of stuff I didn't know you could do. There's also interesting mod projects and whatnot. The only drawback is just the nature of print media in a constantly evolving area like this (example, the firmware roll back stuff has changed a lot in the past few months.) Still a recommended book for PSP fans."
4,Much more than a gimick...,"It looks like a gimick: Turre invites some of his trombone-blowing friends to blow insteda into shells. The compositions range from cuban to indian(!) to bop, so you may think he's just showing off the strange sound of the shells. But no -- there's real essence behind this craziness. Turre has a real vision, a concept of sound, and it just ends up organic and real. What happens is you forget that this is a ""weird"" ensemble (e.g., 3 shells, bass, percussion and a solo trombone) and you just hear strong, commited music."
5,Steve's Shells,I love this CD. Kids of all ages get pleasure listening to the variety of shells Turre uses to make music. It's a rare treat.
5,small corner shelves,"This item worked great. Won't hold much weight, but is a perfect little shelf for unused corners to hold those small items. Works great in the bathroom, too and in kids rooms."
2,corner shelf 5 pc,I had some trouble with the shelves..the blades that come out the sides really marked up my walls and they even fell several times..they would be much better if they were sturdier..they really can't hold much..the idea of them is great I just wish they worked better.
3,Plastic corner shelves,"These shelves are OK if your walls are square. Unfortunately, most walls are not perfectly square, especially at the corners where the joint compound tends to build up. Because of this I used some 3/4 inch wood (the stuff used to cover the edges of tiles on the floor) for extra support. This worked great."
4,Kirby DS game,My nine year old son loves Kirby and this game is fun and a lttle challenging. He is enjoying the game. Thanks!
4,Another Fun Kirby Game...With Rats!,"I don't know if I can say much about this game. The story was weird. Kirby is about to eat cake, and it gets stolen. So, Kirby goes through several worlds to get it back. Eventually, it leads to a bigger plot involving the Squeak Squad and the treasure chests. Anyway, the formula of the Kirby games is the same here. My only problem is that it's too short, and because of that, it doesn't get the perfect score it deserves. But this game is definitely still worth buying."
5,A pretty simple game to understand and play!,"Love this game. It's pretty simple and easy in some levels. In the main story, you are searching & collecting chests in each level. The stylus isn't really used in this game. You can use your finger to select the items you want and the buttons for controlling Kirby.This game isn't too easy nor too hard. Some levels are challenging as to where are the chests located or how to get to them and some bosses are kinda hard to beat. With the right power, the bosses are easy to beat.I've beat the game 100% and that was exciting! I've also beat Kirby Canvas Curse but by 99.7 because of the cart run. I can't get a medal for that one but I did beat that one too on the main story as well. Both are excellent Kirby games for the DS."
5,Kirby Squeekity Squad,It was the most fun game of my ten year old life. The only thing I didn't like was the BOSS challenges. The bonus items gave the game a nice twist. Kirby could be any color depending on the bonus colors you have. I beat the game in a month and I did not care that I was neglecting my other DS games.
1,a waste of huge money,"This game to me is the worst kirby game out there. i am a kirby fan but this is not worth no 34.99 or 29.99. Because you can beat it in one day instead rent it. this game is the worst of them all, why dont they make a remake of kirby superstar instead of this crap. canvas curse is better than this. The controls are good but i expected something like kirby and the crystal shards which you can also beat in one day also but at least theres 3d graphics to come back to.Pretty much if you're going to get it rent it dont buy it.This should be done with almost all kirby games because most are short except for air ride."
3,Dissapointment,"This game is kinda fun, but it is very different. First, it's not like canvas curse that you use the DS at it's full capacity. It's a traditional game, which uses the face buttons. The game is good all kirby games are good, but this one is kinda repetitive and it is not as half as fun as the other ones. It has new cool powers like magic, cupid etc. If I would have known that this game was like this I wouldn't have buyed it at the price listed above..."
3,It was a present,Purchased this item as an XMAS gift. Receiver truly appreciated and enjoyed the gift.
4,Very Good =D,"Although my friend finished this game for me, it was still a ton of fun! I even had fun watching her defeat the Squeak Squad! Well, it was a good game because it was challenging, but not impossible, and you can still play after you finish. The only bad part was that nothing much changed. Every level is basically the same: run around and hunt for treasure. Maybe have something a little different?? But overall, I had a good time playing this game."
3,same thing as always,"when i saw this on tv i thought it looked cool and decided to get itso when i got at first i liked it but after i beat in like 45 minutes i was bored with it. i mean sure theres a mix thing but the only powers you can mix is ice with bomb and sword with thunder,ice,or fire and no you dont interact with the enviorment exept destroy grass and dig so nitendo really needs to create something different. But i guess if you never owned a kirby game and want one then fine get it."
4,An often cited reference,"Rothenberg's book is a highly respected source for those interested in the nuts and bolts of battle in the Napoleonic period. No maps or plates, not a general history. Often mentioned in bibliographies of more recent Napleonic works."
2,Crackly after use....,"I've had this for several months now and the line seems to be getting very crackly, which I'd not experienced with use of other phone coils."
3,timely shipped,"As expected. Matches the promised time of shipment. Simple package, no bubble wrap,just a box with items in plastics"
2,Aburrido...,"Pienso que no es lo mismo leer el libro a que te lo cuenten.... Las narraciones son claras, pero pasar 5 horas sentado escuchando una historia, no es agradable.Mejor comprense el libro!"
3,not like water for chocolate!,"If I wasn't desperately looking for something to take my mind off my worries right now I would have not persisted in reading this. It is overly simple and too obvious. As for it being a love story ... I don't feel it at all. Cortes forces himself on her, hurts her but she wants more...wth? I don't understand the woman at all and it is hard to care about her too much because she is such an underdeveloped character. Is she that desperate for phsyical attention? I am halfway throught but there is no context or explanation for why she would find her sexual subjugation desirable. It is pretty annoying and offensive to me as a woman. Maybe Esquivel should have worked longer on this one."
1,Extremely disappointing,"Like many reviewers here, I admired and enjoyed ""Like Water for Chocolate"" and was intrigued by the concept of this book; therefore I was unpleasantly surprised to find myself slogging through one of the worst novels I have ever read. By the end, I was actually angry and felt ripped off by the publisher, who should never have put this thing in print!Vague, self-contradictory, confusing, and generally inarticulate, ""Malinche"" reads like an early draft that needs to go through many, many revisions to be publishable. I'm afraid the translater can't be blamed for all that's wrong with this mess."
4,Fictionalizing history,"A fictional account of the woman who was Hernan Cortes's translator and lover, mother to the first mestizo, and reviled for helping Spain conquer Mexico."
2,disappointing,I can't believe this book was written by the same author as Like Water For Chocolate. That book was brilliant. This one starts off promising but soon falls flat on its face.
1,Disappointing ...,This book is best described as insipid and a waste of time. Very disappointing for a 'historical account'. Worst book I've read in over a year.
4,Bewitched Season 4,"I really liked Season 1-3 better than the fourth Season and rest of the seasons because Daren (Dick York) did not have as many roles in Season 4, and in some shows he was never seen. It seemed lonely without Daren in the shows and because of his back problems that is why he was so absent in both Season's 4-5, and later replaced with (Dick Sargent) in season 6, who unfortunately does not have a good connection with (Elizabeth Montgomery) as Dick York had. Bewitched ratings went down hill fast when Dick York left the show! Bewitched Season 4 still has some really good shows but in the middle/end you will notice that Daren was missing from the show for no explanation or was out of town, and the roles that he had were smaller."
5,Amazing Betwitching and Entertaining,"Ifn you wanna have a good Good Dose of Bewitched, whip up some Hong Gai Rong Goulash, and sit back for 33 great episodes.As much as I love the first and second seasons, I think Season Four is just about the Peak of the Wonder that is the Series we know as Bewitched. The Queen of Witches gave us a Long living Character that stood the test of time.Through many stories, many episodes, some stronger than others, and I think this varies based on your opinion, she and a great cast delivered with wonderful skill, and perfect charisma.The series has strong production values and hardly ever do you see the wires that allowed the tricks to be done in the flying tricks, but given such a fast production schedule, I guess some mistakes would happen.My one and only complaint is that the space for any extras is taken up by stupid advertisements for other DVDs. This is a great DVD for family viewing; great show, great entertainment."
5,Bewitching!,"I have purchased all 4 of the Bewitched seasons that are out, I am anxiously waiting for the rest of the series to come out as well, these shows are timeless, I have a 4 year old who enjoys them as much as I do, and I know that the content is wholesome enough for him to watch! I loved Bewitched as a kid and I still love it as an adult!"
1,Problem With These Discs,"Is anyone else having issues with these discs? When you first place the discs in the player, it skips over the main menus. Then the ""menu"" button will only start and stop the episode selected, but it will not return you to the main menu. There is no Spanish or Portuguese dubbed audio on the discs (despite what the menus and packaging claim) and the episodes automatically play with Spanish subtitles even when the subtitles are turned ""off."" The only way to avoid this is to choose ""other"" subtitles with the remote. This appears to be an authoring issue, as I am using a two year-old Sony Dream System DVD player and have not had these issues with previous seasons. I'm exchanging my discs immediately, but I have a feeling they might all be bad. Anyone else hear about these issues?"
1,Boring history lesson,"I read this book because I lived in North County San Diego for 15 years. As previously mentioned it took the writer 15 years to write this book, well I feel like it took 15 years to read it. Although the history is interesting to somebody who knows and cares about the area the characters and story line are elementary and boring at best. The development of characters and dialogue are forced and unrealistic.I've read text books the held my interest better."
4,Defines black slapstick,"Saw this in the theater. The whole packed house was laughing on the floor. It's not such a dark comedy you can't empathize with the characters, but it's pretty close. Has a little bit of a Reservoir Dogs feel."
4,Buy 2LDK AND Aragami,"This is actually a review of Dug Fresh's review. Violence in films is good. Good, if the said violence serves the story and isn't gratuitous. If you've ever fired a gun, been in a car accident, or hit someone or have been hit, then you should know that real life violence is so far and away from scripted movie violence they CANNOT be compared. Yes, the world is violent but two characters engaging each other in combat within the context of a good story is not. A good fight scene is like a dance number in a musical or a monologue on SNL. Some people like it and others well... it's just not there thing.Not a Fanboy just fair."
3,fair...,aragami won the movie duel between it and this one. 2ldk starts off promising but somewhere in the middle it becomes predictable and blah.
5,A Fun Guilty PLeasure,"I happened upon 2LDK completely by accident, and was instantly intrigued. This is an odd psychological film, starting innocently enough. But by the end, the two roommate-actresses are literally insane, trying to kill each other. This is a rather over-the-top film, both in terms of the attempted death methods as well as the very short time frame - the entire film takes place in one evening. By the end, the confrontation is somewhat reminiscent of the opening battle of Kill Bill I. This film is clearly NOT for minors, and is quite enjoyable for its odd zaniness."
4,350z Exhaust,"Exhaust is nice, just have some rattling I need to fix underneath the car. The extra power was noticeable and the sound was just a little louder than stock."
5,Pre-teens & teens can make a difference!,"This is a great gift for a pre-teen or teen! It has a great message that young people can make a difference in the world today. It stays engaging through the whole book as it contains many short stories of young, heroic real-life characters. It also hits close to home as the book proceeds through history to near present day. It shows that young people weren't just courageous in history, but can still have a positive influence on their world today."
2,For Big Eared Folks,"Pros: Good Sound--better than cheapos from any discount store; good bass; sound is loud and clear (so you may have to adjust volume accordingly)Cons: very short cable, very uncomfortable as no mesh earbud coverings are provided. Entire headphone is platic, while ear part is softer plastic.Summary and Personal Thoughts:I disliked these headphones as soon as I wore them. My ear canals hurt as a result. They are DEFNITITELY made for people with large ears. So if you have average sized ears, don't get these or else they'll dangle right off; defeating purpose of ""sport-style"" Overall, I needed a pair since my sennhieser died (after 6+ yrs of usage!)and they do the job.Grade of product: C-"
5,Good comfortable ear clips for activities,"I tried so many different ear clips for sport activities: Sony, Philips, Magnavox and so, but this one is the best for me.It matches my ears perfectly and I don't actually feel them. Clips don't fall off.The only complain is the cord could be a little longer.I bought them in Tjmaxx, but after I tried them I decided to by few more just in case... I found the only online."
4,I love Ray Stevens,I love Ray Stevens! He has such a gift of comedy. He has put out better collections of music though. There were only 2-3 songs on this cd that I liked.
3,Ray Stevens come-back CD,"When Ray came out with his first success back in 1961 (JeremiahPeabody's....etc.) who could have predicted that 41 years laterhe would still score hits on the charts. The title of his come-back CD ""Osama-Yo' Mama"" (2002)reminds us of that terrible day.Besides the intro song, there's another patriotic ode called""United We Stand"". The rest of this CD is typical Ray Stevens'type of doing things since 1961: a lot of fun and all kinds ofmusical styles. The best song without any doubt is ""Bon TempsRoulette"" a mixture of honky-tonk, rhythm & blues, rock & rollwith a cajun stomp touch! ""Gone for Good"" is hilarious with acountry pickin' rural background. Also nice are The Hustler,Deerslayer and Freudian Slip. Six nice songs out of ten ain'tbad, although compared to previous Ray Stevens CD's, this come-back ""only"" deserves 3 stars."
3,Good literature history,"This book must have raised some eyebrows when it was first published. It takes place entirely in the narrator's head- he rarely mentions any personal contact with other people, and there's almost no conversation at all. The narrator is a struggling writer who spends the whole book analyzing himself and other artists. If you're into painting and literature of 19th century England and France, you should like this book a lot, because he spends much of it talking about his thoughts of painting and writing. He'll go on for a long time about novels that have made an impression on him."
3,Close up view of A Decadent Lifestyle : Gilded Age in Paris and London,"This book was a shocker in its day. Now, not so much. But there are interesting scenes anddecorative detail that make this book intriguing for anyone enamored of the decadent turn of the 19th to 20th century.Reads more like memoir than a novel and that's part of the charm."
2,Watery colored soap with funky smell,"I bought two sets of these paints so that we would have all six colors. They are basically watery colored soap like the reviewer above me said. They have a strange long-lasting smell that stays on your hands for a few hours. The paint is not bright and solid like I had imagined finger paints to be. But they do wash off the tub, tiles, and fixtures very easily and do not stick to our grout like the packaging said it might. Thankfully I paid only $0.99 per pack at a local discount store so it was worth the money and will definitely last for a few weeks, used sparingly. All in all worth a buck, but I would have been upset if I had paid more."
3,just OK,"I was a little disappointed in this although my 4 year old thought it was cool. The picture shows red, green and yellow, but in the 2 packages I got, I got blue, purple and orange. Ok that's not that important...I just expected primary colors so we could mix and make others. you mix any combination of purple orange and blue and you get brown. anyway, these are just colored soap mostly. I was hoping for more vivid pigment or something more paint like...not just colored soap. But like I said, my kid thought it was fine! If you're 4, 5 stars. if you're 34, 3 stars."
1,Did not function as expected.,"I have an 8 station KVM switch and this does not work. When I move the mouse around it does a right click even when my hand is not on the button. I bought this item because some of the reviews said it worked well with KVM's. I plugged it into the computer via usb and then plugged in the two ps/2 ends from my KVM. I thought maybe it might just be the computer, so I tried it on another computer and it is just as bad as the first computer."
5,older to newer connection,Wanted to use an older model wireless keyboard/mouse with a newer computer. This worked perfectly!
2,Be careful,"This claimed to fit a '73 Superbeetle, but it was too tall and the flap on the car would not close. Be careful before you buy. They did take it back."
5,Bali Pop,"This is a terrific album by the best pop group to come along in years. The musicianship is stellar, the production is creative and intelligent and fun, and the melodies are the best I've heard from any modern band. Their many influences are incorporated smoothly and literately; they compliment the Wondermints' sound but never dominate it, and the songs are all fresh and different but still form a single cohesive album. The title song evokes the Beach Boys' ""Smiley Smile"" album.Almost a kvetch: like much of what's around currently, these great songs tend towards a little glibness (e.g. a song about puppetoons); lyrics are clever without any great depth of feeling. This doesn't affect the pleasure of the listening experience, but they really take it to the next level lyrically and emotionally with great success on their next album, ""Mind If We Make Love To You"", a dynamic stride forward for the best band going."
2,"Not bad, not great.","Bali is a clever pop offering but it's also over-reaching and too derivative for my tastes. Perhaps its only intention is to be an encomium of 60's pop. There are moments of brilliance. (Cellophane and Spoke of a Whirled Wheel being representative of that.) Does this cd draw me in and cause me to listen to it again and again as say Sgt Peppers or Pet Sounds does? Of course not. Is it entertaining? I suppose. There were moments when a chord change or selection of sounds caught me off guard but after a half dozen listenings I ended up skipping over a majority of the songs and the cd now sits in my kitchen underneath, I believe, a pile of papers."
2,Bali No,"Los Angeles' Wondermints worship at the altar of Brian Wilson. In fact, they were his back-up band for his recent tour performing Pet Sounds in its entirety. Bali is more Beach Boys Love You than Pet Sounds, an acquired taste of strained whimsy that will either thrill you or work your last nerve, depending wholly on your mood. When in said mood, I admire the kicky ""Arnoldo Said"" and ""My Id/Entity"", the Association-like back-up vocals of ""Sting o' Luv"", the very-Who ""Riot Grrls R Go"", and the aptly titled ""In and Around Greg Lake"". As for the rest, after seven or eight plays, I can't remember any of it."
1,Gangster Wars,Please can someone tell me how to get the full NBC mini series of 'Gangster Chronicles'? Mail me at cifeacho@hotmail.com
1,The Gangster Chronicles,"I remember the original NBC tv series, as it started my love affair with gangster films. This movie has taken all of the ""guts"" from the mini series, leaving it complete flop in all regards. Joe Penny and the rest of the cast deserve better than this butchered mess. I WANT the original at just about any cost. Can someone help me find it. E-mail me at theasburygroup@yahoo.com Thanks."
5,A lucky find...,"My son's (4 1/2) current enthrallment is pumpkins--he loves the book Pumpkin Day, Pumpkin Night. So when we found this book at the library the other day he was happy to sit and read it. For some reason we didn't check it out and had to go back the next day to get it (and I've since purchased it here). The subtle absurdities and lovely turns of phrase make this a wonderful book--subversive on the order of Good Dog Carl--and the illustrations are lovely. We love reading this together so much that he's memorized the words and loves to talk about walking in the field amoung the young hills that grow up to be mountains. Highly recommended."
3,I just did not like it,"Man sells most of what he has to buy a field, grow punkins on it, sell pumpkins to everyone in the world, uses the income to fully pay off field purchase and re-buy some of the stuff he sold. Ends with him watching field out window. Not a book that I love nor is it one that I hate. It just is what it is."
4,Catherine is a blessing!!,"While the world is full of people trying to tell us ""how"" to worship or ""how"" to seek God, Catherine's approach is one that merely shows an inherent goodness in the world and that God is merciful and kind. She doesnt profess to be a biblical scholar or preacher and that approach is refreshing.I read her column in my local newspaper every week and it is a welcome respite from the violence and diatribe of base human behavior that fills most of the newspapers pages.The world is full of clowns who think that they have been shown the way to God and that they have somehow cornered the market on holiness and understanding the will of God. The world we live in is full of people who think their way is the only way to salvation. Who are they to judge others?Catherine is none of that and her writings dont profess that either. Buy her book, enjoy her writing and her upbeat optimism!"
5,"Very Powerful,Spiritual,Hair raising,educational,must read.","At the very tender age of 15,I had read both books about the story of Nicky Cruz.""The Cross and the Switchblade""as well as the Run Baby Run.Since then I have read both more than Ten times.This heart rinching story capture every little boy or teenager imagination of the Big cities like New York,gangs,etc.This book really confirms that the Cross is mightier than the switchblade."
4,Good Read,For the Kindle edition:Having grown up with this story in a Christian home I wasn't sure I wanted or needed to read the book. I'm glad I did - the book is simple in its presentation and the language is not gripping in itself but the story is. The courage and persistence required to reach out and help people so different than yourself is portrayed well in this book. Knowing the obstacles keeps so many of us from moving ahead - this is tale of pressing forward and making a difference in the world. Definitely a good book but written on a level for young teens.
5,One of the best books I've ever read.,"Just saw that there is an old movie, with Pat Boone, made from this book.Don't know how the movie will be yet. However, I like to give good reviews for books that deserve them and many years after having read this one - which I had virtually forgotten til today - I still see it as one of the most profound witnesses to what a life in Messiah should reflect. Amazing story. It will bless you and humble you."
5,Wonderful,"A riveting story that takes you into what true despair and breathtaking glory are all about. Too read this story you feel as if you are there. I recommend this book to everyone, believer or not. If you do not believe in miracles you will after reading this book."
2,NOT A CLASSIC??,I recently had to read a classic book for my english class and I chose the cross and the switchblade...I saw the classic sticker and figured it had to be good...WHAT...THIS BOOK WAS TERRIBLE...if your extremely interested in the life of a heroin addict this is the book for you...THIS BOOK HAS NO SENSE OF CLOSURE AND IS A TOTAL WASTE OF YOUR TIME...
5,The Cross and the Switchblade,The story of David Wilkerson who founded Teen Challenge. This is a really good book for anyone liking good non-fiction.
2,Not as satisfied as before,"The book is not a good copy...it may be because it is old, but the pages are tearing out as I read them"
1,"Poor, Poor, Poor","Book was soiled , written in and smelled bad. Very poor condition. Took longer to arrive, as well. Not at all as advertised."
5,worth reading again and again,"This is the inspiring and amazing-but-true story of a man who obeyed God to sell his television and substitue prayer for his former viewing time.This is not an erudite theological treatise, but an account of the miracles that can follow simple love-inspired action. I have read it straight through for the fourth time and it does not get tiresome. Each time I read it, I am struck to think how many people God has asked to do something equally as bold, and how few have obeyed.Life-changing."
5,An Inspiritional Book.....,I read this book for an outside reading report for my high school. I thought it was an amazing book. It is awesome to know that some people still actually care about others. I thought it was a fantastic book and I recommend it to anyone who is or isn't a Christian. It is a great book for someone who doesn't understand the power of God.
5,The Cross and The Switchblade,"I was very pleased with my book. it was delivered fast, and the packaging was done right. I look forward to doing business with you again.Thank You"
5,very good quality and prize,have changed the old one. the vacuum itself last years and still powerful indeed and very handy in use. the filter was expensive in store. this is exactly what I need. cost little and shipped to me really quickly. will reorder if need more.
3,Nominee: Most Refreshing Musicians - Incognito,I have been a fan of the musical genius Bluey and this band of musicians for many years; and they continue to amaze me with their dynamic sound. The refreshing brand of music that Incognito continues to create is a real delight and totally overshadows the roster of manufactured faddish so-called performers currently getting radio airplay. A must have for your Incognito CD collection!
2,Waiting-room revelations,"2 1/2The widely regarded lite-jazz fusion group excelled at smooth radio-friendly material but conversely produced a majority of slick, impersonal fare which can only serve its greater purpose cozied with irrelevant magazines and stale snacks. Enough material provides slight compositional insight to counteract vocal-driven bores."
4,essential writing,"The stories in this book are sea tales in Conrad's tradition of pessimistic, psychological fiction. Typhoon is particularly good, but the other stories are interesting as well. If it seems like Conrad is just writing adventure stories, well, that's just not true. He's writing about the most important themes, and setting them against a backdrop of exciting seafaring and travel.If a reader finished Heart of Darkness, and enjoyed it, then that reader might want to pick this book up next, and give it a whirl."
5,god is in control,We all know the word to the popular so He's Got the Whole world in his hands. Now the words have been written in a beautiful picture book for kids to enjoy. In today's times it nice to be remined that God does have the whole world in his hands. Looking at illustrations in the book will remind you of that very fact!
4,A Great Buy,"This book is great! Love the pictures as well as the message a beautiful book, great positive message; shown through the eyes of a young African American boy with his dad along side. Beautiful!"
2,Dvd isnt what I thought it would be!,"I thought that this dvd was a video dvd, with Barrys image on it, but it turns out that it is only a dvd just like the cd A Christmas Gift Of Love. The scenes were supposed to move on the dvd but I couldnt get them to move. This is not a good dvd,"
5,Good Quality!,"This is the same filter that the manufacturer uses, so it fits, it works as designed and is priced good. I will definitely by one again next time it's filter change time!"
3,Hms Ulysses - for male teenagers,Loved this book when I was a teenager but found it rather silly now that I am well grown up! Rollicking good adventure story in outdated gung ho style.
2,A dissenting view,"I know I'm the odd person out here, because virtually all the reviews are favorable & some consider this work a ""classic"", but, frankly, I didn't like this book. And, mind you, I like war novels & have read many of them. This book is unrelievedly gloomy & depressing & gets more so as the book goes on. There is way too much description & not enough conversation. Contrary to what several reviewers said, I found the character development weak to nonexistent. There were some interesting characters & I would have liked to know more about them, but the characters took second place to endless descriptions of the weather & damage reports. I plowed through it because I thought it was my duty to do so, but really, I found this book disappointing."
5,A great WW2 story,"Probably one of the best ever WWII naval novels. The writing made you feel you were part of the crew, living with characters like Valerie and the Kapok Kid. Not only the crew but you felt you were part of the ship and all that happened to her. A book you couldn't put down nor one you wanted to put down."
5,THE BEST BOOK EVER!!!!,"This is my favorite book!!!! I loved it!!! Everyone should read it, even people that aren't very interested in horses! This book is very good to read, once you start reading it, you can't stop. It is a wonderful book with a great theme. I would DEFINITELY reccomend this book to anyone!"
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL,This was a most remarkable book!I absolutely loved it.I will never get rid of this book.It's completely great.It was wonderfully written!I cried in the sad parts.How could anyone hurt such a wonderful animal!I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I loved this book!!! I couldn't seem to put it down. I was either worried about Agba finding Sham or weather Sham's three sons would win their Newmarket races. This book was extraordinarily written. I loved the part when Sham is standing with the Royal people.
5,The One True King!!!!!!!!,"I have always been a very ""addicted"" to horse novels. I read all the horse books in my elementry school and my middle school setting the record for the most books checked out in a single year. So, I have become a ""expert"" on horse novels, and as horse novels go KING OF THE WIND has taken number one. It has just about everything one could want. A daring stallion and his young master who has to save him from uncertian fates. You'll laugh and cry and yes you'll yell. But you'll be missing out on one of the best horse books of all time if you don't read this one."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"I LOVE this book!!!!!It was one of the best books I've ever read(this one,Black Gold,and some others).This book was SOOOOOOOOOO wonderful!I can see why it's a Newberry Award Winner.If you love horses,you are sure to love this book.I will definitely read this book again and again and again."
5,it`s a wonderful book,a colt is born in a stable with a star on his head which stands for ''speed'' but the spot on his chest stands for ``misfortune`` but as his life goes on he is mistreated by some owners and others are very good to him ... agba is a boy that loves him and wants to be with him forever but can not the golden stallion is named ( shame ) as the sun ... this is a very good but and i hope you read it
4,Have loved this since I was a child,This is a great book for children who love horses. I ordered it on kindle just so I could read it again. If I was giving it as a gift I would the actual book since alot of the pictures are in color and it really is something to keep. I still have my original book I received when I was a child.
5,Classic horse story,This was one of my favorite books as a child. I was delighted to share it this Christmas with a young friend who was utterly entralled by it. The illustrations are great. A great book for tweenie girls who love horses -- and most of them do.
4,Good Book,"First I must say I'm not a ""young reader"" which is who this book is intended for. I'm also not really a horse person, but I wanted to read this book because of it winning the Newbery Medal. Another plus, which I didn't know until after reading the book, is that it is based on a true story. I found the book to be enjoyable and frustrating/sad at the same time. Sad because of how Agba and Sham continually were abused or just plain treated awful. All of this was bearable because I had a feeling/hope that everything would turn out in the end--and for the most part it did!"
5,Great,"I'm 15 and play sports most of my waking hours. But when I get a chance to sit down and read a good book, I want one I can get lost in. King of the Wind is easy to get into. I thouroghly enjoyed it and read it all the time. It is definetly woth getting."
3,This is not like the original large book....,"I was expecting the same beautiful book that I had when I was a young girl--about 8 x 10 in size with the beautiful drawings, and several color prints. This is a POCKET SIZED BOOK, with the pictures so shrunken that they aren't done justice, and no color prints. The picture on the cover isn't even a bay, as was ""Sham"", the Godolphin Arabian. It is a wonderful story that I wanted to share with my grand daughter, and I am just hoping that the entire story is included within, and that parts weren't left out of this ""condensed"" version."
3,"For horse-lovers, young and old","This is the story of the founding father of racehorses, Sham, ""King of the Wind,"" and his friend, the stable boy, Agba. The story begins in Morocco where the sultan sends Sham and Agba off to France as a gift for the king. But the French laugh at the little horse and Sham is sent off to a series of owners, here and there, loved and hated, until he finally ends up in England. It is only in England when the true nature of Sham's racing abilities are realized through his offspring, three horses who win for their owner prize after prize.In fourth grade, my teacher read this book aloud. In fact, that's all my teacher read aloud in fourth grade...Marguerite Henry's horse stories. I wasn't into horses and these stories bored me silly. Now I'm a grownup and I can see the beauty of the writing and the adventure of the tale."
4,I love horses!Especially the ones by Marguerite Henry!,"King of the Wind is an exciting story!I love Marguerite's ideas.She must love horses verryy much.My mom grew up on a farm, and she had a horse named,King.He was her baby.She loved him very much.When i was born my mom introduced me to a horse,and I fell in love with it.When I moved I thought that all of my friends were left behind,along with the books about the animals I love.My friend,Kourtney,knew that I loved horses and she told me to read Misty of Chincoteague(probobly spelled it wrong)and I loved it! Then I started looking for more of her books.I found King of the Wind.I just read it ,and did a book report about it.It was a Real Joy!Marguite really knows what horses really are about.She is a effectionate person Who loves to Write about horses,and I support her.She needs to keep her dream alive,just like her stories!I love Horses!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Beautiful and Heartrending,"Marguerite Henry's fictionalized biography of the Goldolphin Arabian, one of the three founding thoroughbred sires, follows the horse Sham and his mute groom Agba from the stables of the Sultan of Morocco through hardship in France and England to celebrated triumph at stud. The trials Sham and Agba go through are almost unbearable to read, but vividly rendered. Agba, who never speaks a word, is one of the most absorbing characters in children's fiction. Lovely illustrations. Most children will find this book fascinating, and it's a must for horse lovers."
2,?????,I thought this was going to be a live performance from KENNY G.instead this was just a recording with a fire place burning not what i was expecting.
3,Scenery nothing much,"LOVE Kenny G music, so this DVD is not a complete waste, but have seen many more with more creative scenery."
5,Great mix,"I love this CD. Got it at Starbucks way back in the day, and it has been a family favorite on car trips for years. Some songs are in English and some are not, but that doesn't stop us from trying to sing along to them anyway haha. Great background music too"
3,What a train-wreck cast of characters!,"On a positive note, the book was a fast read and somewhat of a page turner....a ""quick-read"", sadly without much depth. Every female character was a huge disappointment in that those portrayed were either huge town gossips, bigots, or corrupt. 'Sure didn't make me feel very proud to be a member of the female gender. If anything, this book was a cheap thrill. It taught me absolutely nothing; yet I admit that to it least some degree it held my interest."
3,"Great book, not so great ending!!","This is the first book I have read by Ms. Sloane and I really enjoyed it. That is, until the last couple of chapters. As other readers have commented, it does leave one hanging. Up until that point, I would have given it 5 stars.Still, the murder mystery was interesting and well done. I guessed who did it and changed my mind several times. Always the sign of a well written mystery. You really come to care about the main characters, maybe that is why the ending was so frustrating.I do recommend this book, with reservations. I plan to read Ms. Sloan's, Guilt by Association as soon as possible. Look for my review!!"
3,A real disappointment,"I was very disappointed. The book had great potential but fell short at the end. There were,far, too many things left unresolved.you felt no closure. I am stil aiting for the sequel."
2,An Isolated Incident...Not the best book I've read.,"I just got done reading this book. It was a great suspense/mystery book at first. However, the characters were not well developed and the plots were never finished. The ending leaves the reader wondering ""Why?"" and ""How?"". I was very disappointed because when you spend your time reading a 470 page book, you expect it to actually be worthwhile at the end and actually come to a closure. Well, this one wasn't and didn't. I have never read any other of Susan Sloan's books, and I doubt I ever will. I am very disappointed to say the least."
2,WORST READ EVER !!!!!!,"THe only good thing about this book is a little romance by the 2 main characters . The rest of the book is a bore ! Author goes into to much deatil about each persons jobs and at times there lives BORING . Then the ending as to who did the killing is not really clear , A currupt police station sends the wrong man to jail and he ends up getting killed . All in all the whole story is terrible . This is my first book by this author and will be for sure my last . Don't waste you hard earned money on the book ."
4,An Isolated Read,"I really liked this book. I am an avid reader of mysteries and who-done-its. This book was one I couldn't wait to get to at the end of a long day. It was just downright interesting. Although I had the bad guy correctly pegged in about the middle of the book, it was still a good read. It probably helped that I live in the Great Pacific Northwest, making it all the more interesting. The characters were interesting and human. In one's own mind, the scenery was magnificent. I'm going to read Ms. Sloan's other book very soon."
2,If only this book WERE more isolated,"The author had good intentions, but needed a much lighter touch for this book. The premise of an isolated island community rocked by a shocking murder is very intriguing. Unfortunately, the author didn't bring any new ideas to the mix. The killer is obvious from the first few chapters, and the rest of the book is comprised largely of heavy-handed caricatures and anvil-dropping. I don't like books that talk down or preach to the reader, and this did plenty of both."
4,small town murder,"A very interesting story of a murder that happens in a small town and the consequences. The characters seemed very real, as did the community. I had a hunch of who the killer was and had to speed all the way to the last page to see if I was right! Wasn't a nail biter, but good all the same."
5,". . . and when they came for me, there was no one left to speak up . . .","Not only a great thriller/mystery, but a chilling look at how insular a small community can become, looking at ""us"" and ""them."" People can sneer and say that these sorts of things don't really happen, but I grew up in a town just like this and it is true - if someone with darker skin, or the ""wrong"" religion showed up, they were an outsider and not accepted and treated with suspicion. Ms. Sloan showed how difficult it was for the few sympathetic townsfolk to stand up for the ""outsiders,"" as well as to stand up against the popular view about whodunit.The book is so cleverly written that it is almost impossible to tell who the culprit is until it is revealed in the last paragraph - then the true depravity of the situation hits home and the book becomes horror, in essence. I loved it. I felt it was well-written, held together nicely and kept all the disparate elements going quite well. Give it a try!"
2,Major loose end,"Two days after I finished this I thought -- hey, wait a minute, she never explained just how the anti-semite group just happened to have a knife with Tara's blood on it to conveniently plant in the teacher's car. They supposedly didn't know who did it so how do they explain having the murder weapon? Did anyone else pick up on that and if so, did she explain it anywhere?"
4,"A great book , but ended non-conclusively .","The book is great for simple reading , and I found it to be quite intresting through out . It is not ""deep"" and is good for light reading . The characters are quite intresting although not much emotion is shown . It does give some insight to human behaviour and society's wrongful conduct . However the ending made me wonder if the author wanted to keep the option of a sequal . It could have ended more conclusively . I would recommend anyone intrested in murder mystries to read it ."
1,Not worth the price,"I agree with others who felt this book was a disappointment. The characters were shallow, the plot fragmented, the motivations stereotypical."
1,Poorly written Ending,"I just finished Susan Sloan's An Isolated Incident I kept reading trying to find a coherant plot and character. The ending is unsettling, poorly written and unfocused. I will never read another Susan Sloan book. Ms Sloan uses unfair writing techniques to set up an improbable ending, and then she doesn't end it. She leaves too much up in the air. Jerry Frankel is the only sympathetic character in the book. Very unsatisfying read."
1,What an incredible letdown!!!,"At first I was unable to put this book down. The intriguing beginning piqued my interest, and the compelling theme grabbed my attention and forced me to continue to find out what happened. Sloan's style of writing is very skillful and her artistry is outstanding ... therefore, my question is, how come she began a book with such potential and promise and then proceeded to force on her readers such a disappointing ending? It's a shame, because the book had so much potential. Too bad she wasted it on such triviality and shallowness. Her writing style made it very clear that she could have done much better. I only recommend this book if the reader stops after the first half; it's better to make up your own ending than accept the author's."
3,"Book was okay, ending was a big disappointment","I thought overall the book was good, and unlike everyone else I didn't have the killer pegged at all! I was actually quite surprised. I thought the book had a lot of loose ends and subplots that just fizzled out. The relationship between Ginger and Ruben was just left hanging, as was the relationship between Stacey and Danny. I thought the teenagers' vocabulary was unrealistic. Dialogue was NOT typical of high school kids; too formal and robotic. Never quite understood the whole Malcolm Purdy deal-- really unnecessary to this story, I think. I hear Ms. Sloan's first book is terrific though... think I'll read that one."
4,"Captivating book, end falls a bit short","A great read. I'm not big on novels, but found I could not put this book down and was looking forward to my read each day on the way home from work.Only complaints - a few ends not tied up properly, end just ended, Ruben and Ginger's relationship quite weak.A good read, well recommended !"
5,"Terrific story, wonderfully written!!!","I have been a lover of mysteries for a long time and this one is definitely at the top of the list when it comes to favourites! Only a highly skilled author with a keen sense of detail could create a story such as this one. A terrible crime with several suspects and it all weaves together briliantly at the end for not just one, but several stunning surprises. A must read for any suspense lover."
4,A tightly written procedural.,"Susan Sloan has done a great job exploring the impact of a murder on a small, fairly isolated community. She tells her story from several different angles, and explores racism in the process. I was only slightly disappointed in the ending- the read along the way more than made up for a fairly pat solution. I will read her first book."
2,Depressing Ending,"Sloan is not a lawyer and needs to get her facts straight, starting with real life. This book keeps you guessing until the end which wasn't pleasant."
2,Not a Mystery,"While the author has a fine ability to describe the setting and an interesting array of characters, I knew the murderer very early in this book--and I rarely can do that. Also a main character acts out-of-character two-thirds of the way through which distorts the plot. But my biggest disappointment was with the ending. This is not a mystery to solve but a drama of prejudice and racism, and I found the ending left a bitter taste. I live in the Pacific Northwest and to characterize it with such unrelenting--and unresolved--bigotry is unfair and untrue. Such a shame that an author feels readers want that kind of book."
2,Small town bigotry and a murder paralyze police,"Thought I reviewed this a month ago but do not see it. Sloan disappointed me with this effort. I agree with those who criticized An Isolated Incident and wonder about those gave it a rave. There were too many ill-defined characters, too much hatred and angst which was never resolved and a police force which made Barney Fife look like a genius. Don't waste time on this turkey."
4,Interesting Investigation,"Perry approaches an interesting investigation for even todays standards, not to mention how it must of been in the Victorian era. I applaud Perry for addressing the subject and the depraved way people can use other people, and what people will/have to do for money. Perry obviously feels very deeply about the abuse of children. Unfortunaltely this is something that could happen in the Victorian times as well as now.It isn't always hard to figure out ""whodunit"" in Perry's mysteries, however she still weaves an intriguing tale.I was confused on whether this was Perry's 5th or 6th novel in the Pitt series, but I read it as the 5th.I appreciate Perry's descriptions of the surroundings of her subjects, I am able to visulize it, feel either the warmth of the fire, or the coldness of the weather."
2,Poor quality reproduction of a favorite,"Anne Perry has been one of my favorite authors for many, many years. I was delighted to see that the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series is available on Kindle. However, as I am re-reading the old favorites, I am very disappointed by the poor reproduction quality of the entire series. Many words are misspelled through obvious optical character recognition errors. The price of each book warrants at least a proofread of the content. My rating is based on this issue; a review of the writing and storyline would be much, much higher."
4,Bluegate Fields,Her books are a great read for anyone who likes mystery combined with history. You always learn something you didn't know from her books.
3,"For You, For Me, For Evermore","Good Morgana King album undercut by production values. Her vocals are embedded in orchestral mush much of the time. Best tracks, given this, are: Ev'rything I Love, I'll String Along With You, and You're Not So Easy To Forget."
2,"Not what I thought it would be,,,",It shows the Joes in action displays but not the clothing in display so you can see what went with the outfits. I needed a book that showed clothing and accessories seperately and with more detailed descriptions.
4,My husband enjoyed it...,"I bought this book as a gift for my husband, who recently began collecting GI Joes. He was very pleased with the book and you can frequently find him browsing it, especially after he receives his catalogs/magazines."
5,Stellar,This book is full of inspiration and leaves you just wanted to get started on a new project. Clear concise and well ilustrated to take you all through the process of creating projects or orignial masterpiecesTHE SHIPPING WAS SO QUICK TAKING ABOUT 4 DAYS TO AUSTRALIA- VERY IMPRESSED
1,Misleading,"I can't begin to express how disappointed I was with this book. I bought it specifically for the Mariner's compass patterns and for directions on how to do it without foundation pieceing. Theere was a lot of information on how to make patterns, but all of the examples and projects were not true Mariner's compass, they were odd variations. And most of the directions were for foundation piecing, in which I was not at all interested. The flying geese borders and info on circular borders was fine, but the stuff on Mariner's compass, for which I purchased this book, was not at all helpful, or inspiring, especially for someone such as I, who wants to hand piece and hand sew the antique patterns. I wish the author (or whomever) had been more explicit in stating that these were modern variations on tradtional themes."
5,It made me homesick for a little town that never existed.,"Leacock wrote in the introduction that Mariposa represented seventy or eighty different towns throughout Canada. The residents were composite characters of people he knew. Leacock did a great job of making the town seem alive. I wished I were there for the picnics, the cruises on the lake and the poker games. The plots of vignettes were good. The writing was too cute sometimes. His classical references were over my public school education at times. The characters were drawn fairly well. What the author did very well was the throw away descriptions of the characters. He would almost insult the characters he was describing in such endearing terms that I immediately felt drawn to the character.Leacock was amazing talent. The book wasn't deep, but it was a fun, enjoyable ride down memory lane."
5,"Great for thick, dry hair.","I have used this shampoo and conditioner for years. (Back in the day, the shampoo was called Pliance and only the conditioner was Quench.) I could never find it after I moved to the West Coast. I had my mom ship it across the country. My hair is thick, coarse, dry and curly and this stuff works like magic. I am so glad I can order through Amazon. I like it better than Bumble and Bumble, Frederick F, Moroccan Oil, and Ouidad, none of which I probably spelled correctly. The only thing that works like it, for my hair, is Neutrogena's conditioner. Still, I panic when I run low on my Quench. Great stuff."
5,Heavenly Music,"I have listened to Abour Zena for years on vinyl and never got a copy on cd until now. It was delivered on time and in prime condition. The music, of course, is legendary."
2,A FAILED EXPERIMENT,"As big a fan as I am of Keith Jarrett, frankly this record is one of my least favorite. Admittedly, it was an experiment of the type you would expect from ECM; but it doesn't work for me. There are sections when Jarrett just plays his keyboard unfettered and these are interesting and enjoyable. The saxophonist, Jan Garbarek, however seems to be an acquired taste-his horn sounds like a loon across a frozen lake. Be that as it may, I didn't enjoy his solos as I normally would any other sax man. The normally dependable Charlie Haden is almost inaudible here. I especially could do without the string orchestra that pops up constantly.Nevertheless, I suppose one has to take this record for what it is: an experiment in a style Jarrett did not go back to. My own brother swears by this record. I swear at it."
5,5 stars,"Of all the albums Jarrett had recorded with symphony orchestras (""LUMINESCENCE"", ""IN THE LIGHT"")-this one is perhaps the most eloquent and prominent work. A great input by both Jan Garbarek on saxes and Charlie Haden on bass."
2,wantabe!,"THE TITLE SAYS IT ALL. LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING I SHOT IN MY BACKYARD,DON'T WASTE YOU'RE TIME OR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Dog won't touch it,"My dog is a lab and like most labs, will eat anything and I do mean anything and everything, except for this stuff. No matter how little was sprinkled on my dog's food or what I mixed it in, he would not touch it. Thankfully Amazon issued a refunded."
5,"Wonderfully rich, heartwarming romance!","I really love the way this author tells a story. She has a deceptively simple style...The plot rolls along easily and it pulls you in, but there is such substance to the relationships that are being formed. I really enjoyed this book, and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a romance novel with likeable characters and a lot of heart! Recommend highly!"
4,George MacDonald: an undiscovered light,"C.S. Lewis considered George MacDonald his mentor and inspiration, and one can well see why. MacDonald has the amazing subtle insight into human nature and the relevance of Christ to modern man that made Lewis famous. MacDonald's prose style is often awkward, but it contains such incredible magic and truth that it should not be passed by.It's mostly impossible to find MacDonald's works in their original form, and frankly they are very difficult to read that way. This book contains a selection that I didn't always agree with, but I suppose some cuts need to be made.If you like C.S. Lewis at all, read MacDonald. He's worth it."
3,"The only one of her books I've read, so I don't know if it's her best!","I read 'One Night of Scandal' partly as a change of pace from my usual reading, and partly because I was running out of books to read!I found I could skip over quite a bit of it without feeling I'd missed anything. The changes in tone from light banter to heavy, brooding drama, to the usual 'steamy' scenes, were pretty much the standard for books like this. Since I'm not a big romance fan anyway, I didn't mind the emphasis on the relationship between Lottie and Allegra, though I felt the last chapter was a bit too predictably melodramatic. Still, the story was at its best when it was just the two of them.Hayden was a bit too wussy to take seriously, and I didn't really mind his occasional absences. All the buildup with his background and his first wife's 'troubles' didn't quite deliver what it promised.Recommended for those who like historical romance novels, but not for those who are really picky about plot development!"
3,Not Very Enjoyable,"I have been reading as many of Medeiros books as I can find. Some have been really good, and with humor to the story, others have been kind of odd.This one was kind of on the dull side. Too much time was spent going over and over the first wife and how upset she was. Then more about the fact that she died. The daughter was just plain weird.Not impressed with this book."
5,Outstanding,"One Night of Scandalby: Teresa MedeirosReviewer: Pamela Ackerson (author Home of the Braves trilogy)Teresa Medeiros is one of my favorite authors. As many books as I read, there may be a handful of authors that I actually remember. She is one of them. One Night of Scandal is about an adventuress debutante, Carlotta Fairleigh, and it did not disappoint me--passionate scenes that sizzle, with main characters that feel like real people, Ms. Medeiros makes you feel as if you are a fly on the wall, watching the story unfold before your eyes. Definitely one of those books you want to put in the shopping basket."
3,Okay ........but not the best,"I wasn't very happy with this book after reading a Kiss to Remember. The characters weren't together enough to fall in Love. Most of the time was with Lottie and Allegra. I also seemed more of a love story between Hayden and Justine. This situation also confused me....did he love her like a wife or child (as Ned indicted). If he loved her like a child, then I can see him not sleeping with her for 6 years, but otherwise don't get that. I am usually turned off by romance novels when the one involved is still in love with someone else. All in all, I hated that everytime Hayden was thinking it was usually about Justine. If he was still so tormented by her and loving her, how could he fall for Lottie. I guess I like to read the books where the hero just can't remember life before the heroine - Fiction I guess :-)"
2,Disappointing!,"Teresa Medieros is one of my favorite authors--I usually pick up her books just on the basis of her name, knowing I'll find a well-written story laced with humor and romance. But this book was completely disappointing! Compared to her other novels, this one was sorely lacking, in terms of underdeveloped characters and ridiculous plot twists. It just didn't pull me in; the novel is definitely not up to par. Sorry, Teresa, this one just doesn't cut it. Here's to hoping your next novel maintains your usual excellent standard!"
4,Good!!,"I am a big fan of Teresa Medeiros' books and when I heard of a sequel to ""A Kiss to Remember"", I had to go out and buy it when it hit the stores. Although I read it in a few hours, I thought it would have had a different plot and ending, but I still love it like I do all of her other books. The main thing that annoyed me about the book was that Hayden was still kinda stuck on his dead wife while Lottie was trying so hard to make him love her. She even made his daughter like her. I loved that Lottie's personality hadn't changed from ""A Kiss to Remember"" because if it had, the book would have turned out dull. All in all, I think that fans will be pleased with her latest book as I was and if they haven't, they should read all of her others."
3,Just OK,"I'm a big Teresa Medeiros fan, but this is not one of her best books. The two protagonists barely talk for 3/4s of the book, but they manage to fall in love...? I read to the end, but I wasn't enjoying this read as much I did Yours Until Dawn or the Devil Wears Plaid."
4,A lovely story,This story was lovely. I liked both the heroine and the hero--I liked how the author wove a very special storyline in this book--it was different then most historical romance stories I have read.This is not my favorite Teresa Medieros book but it is well worth the readers time to read. The main characters have stayed in my thoughts longer then most characters in a book upon completion usually do.
2,Not for the discriminating romance reader,"I just don't understand all of these positive reviews. This book is way below average - definately NOT a keeper. I've enjoyed many of Ms. Medeiro's books but this one is so poorly written that I could barely finish it. Hayden St. Clair is supposed to be a lonely, brooding, dark character but the book is so flip that it destroys any intensity he might generate. As a result, the chemistry between Hayden and Carlotta doesn't work and the plot just doesn't make sense. At one point - when Carlotta feels she's betrayed Hayden - she flees to London for four months! Why? Then she supposedly redeems herself by publishing a sordid novel about their life story - one that puts her in a bad light. However, we're never told exactly what she has written about herself. What a disappointment!"
4,"A sequel to ""A Kiss to Remember""","I'm not aware at first that ""One Night of Scandal"" is a sequel to ""A Kiss to Remember"", the story about Lottie's sister Laura & Sterling Harlow. After finishing ""ONoS"", I cannot help myself from revisiting Laura & Sterling's story and reread ""AKtR"", Wow, Teresa Medeiros is just superb. I give 4 stars for ""ONoS"" because though it is quite good, it is not as poignant as ""AKtR"", which I give 5 stars. If you like ""ONoS"" make sure that you also read ""AKtR""."
1,Extremely Juvenile,"While reading this book I continuously kept thinking I must have picked it up in the tween section of the library. Pretty much everything about this book is foolishly unrealistic and completely childish. I actually had a bigger problem with Lottie than I did w/ Hayden. No 20 year old woman living in that time period would have behaved in the way she did. She was idiotic. So was her friend, Harriet, who chased her to Cornwall and became a servant in her home instead of asking to see her and ask to stay there. Even the way they collected cats was weird. This book is just plain dumb. Everything is cliche, drawn out, boring and while I did enjoy the 2 love scenes in the book, they are near the end and it's just not nearly enough to save this mess of a story. I whole heartedly recommend skipping ""One Night of Scandal""."
1,boring and dragged out,"I usually read a historical romance novel in 2 days. Long, boring and drawn out!!!!! This is the first of Medeiros books for me and the last!!!!"
2,Starts with a bang ends with a whimper.,"The beginning the book was superb. Hayden was smitten to say the least...Lottie was also intrigued and curious about this dashing, murderering marquess. The characters were instantly likeable that I was sure that the rest of the book would be equally so. That is until he marries her and takes her home and things turn really bad. His kid made me nuts, his emotional scars was so convoluted it was ridiculous. I was so sick of this guy and his problems by the end of the story I was hoping she would high-tail it out of there. Grrr...this could have been a great book ...man was I disappointed."
4,Lovely,"I'm not going to write a synopsis, since that can be found elsewhere. I have to say that Teresa Medeiros never disappoints, and this latest novel of hers proves to be just as worthy as her others. I'll admit that I have my favorites among Medeiros' work- Thief of Hearts, Once an Angel, and Nobody's Darling being, I think, the best. This novel encompasses Medeiros' notorious beautiful writing, yet it isn't one of my favorites. I'd place it on a par one down from some of her best, along with Lady of Conquest and A Whisper of Roses. However, if you liked either of these two above mentioned books, perhaps One Night of Scandal will tickle your fancy. However, anyone who loves Medeiros' work and appreciates truely beautiful historical romance will cherish this novel along with her rest. It will be a nice addition to any collection of historical romance."
3,Not her best,"I loved A kiss to remember, and waited for One night of Scandal, but was a little dissapointed. Yes it had it's funny moments, thouching moments, but overall, I'd say that it's biggest flaw was that Lottie and Hayden weren't together enough of the time to actually fall in love with each other. Most of the time Hayden was off brooding, and Lottie was with Allegra, Hayden's daughter from his first wife.Other then that it was a good book. If your a fan of Teresa Mederos, you'll be pleased that she sticks with her usual style of writting. You might be a little dissapointed over the lack of actual togetherness of the couple have, but no book is perfect. If you nver read anything by by her before I suggest you start with A kiss to remember or even Beauty and the beast."
5,Historical Fiction,Once again an outstanding book by Bodie and Brock. I love their books and their ability to make you feel you are there.
5,"Rogers and Hammerstein: The King and I , Julie Andrews, Ben Kingsley",One of the best productions of this musical score. Happy to have in my collection again.I recommend it highly!
3,The King & I by Keith Mitchell : Not Julie Andrews on this CD,The King and Iby Keith Mitchell - Supreme Legend Series. Julie Andrews and Ben Kingsley are definitely NOT the performers on this CD!! I don't know who is trying to sing the parts.
4,Shall I Tell You What I Think of You ...,"An all star cast in sumptuous Philips sound ... but ... At the center of the story is Anna and it's good to hear Julie Andrews giving it a game try but, after all her well-publicized vocal trauma, it's about twenty years of vocal wear too late. It's not that it's awful, it's just sad to hear this once crystal clear voice in this rough (1992) condition. On the other hand, in the original Broadway cast, Gertrude Lawrence also had vocal issues so I guess we are ready to accept a less than perfect voice in this role. I am.The rest of the cast all acquit themselves well enough and conductor John Mauceri with the Hollywood Bowl Symphony play this familiar score beautifully."
4,Great music...but,"How could you not apprecite the music? And, it is the music that matters! Still, I wanted more...more about the story and the history of the times, the conflict, and the context that would extend my understanding of the lyrics. That issue is not a criticism of the wonderful music but a request from the people who design the print material that accompanied the CD."
5,Excellent performance of THE KING AND I!,"The role of Anna in this album is Julie Andrews. It's very successful recording of THE KING AND I. I like this version, especially GETTING TO KNOW YOU. The arrangement of this CD is the movie version, but it's not a problem. Wonderful cast, wonderful orchestra, and the numbers are very good. If you were a fan of THE KING AND I, a must buy!"
2,Lea is great...the others are NOT,Lea Salonga is the only reason anyone should buy this cd! The rest of the cast is practically horrendous!!!! Especially the lkittle Kingsley boy as Louis! Never in my life have I been more disappointed by a cd!~
1,"Thanks, but no thanks!","Give me a break! Did we need another ""King & I"" recording? NO! The 1977 revival cast recording is superb, as is the 1956 soundtrack from the film, at least the gold cd version released with the 40th anniverseray laser disk edition. Alfred Newman's arrangements are indeed spectacular and are obviously preserved for eternity on the soundtrack, so why do we need this rediculous imitation? If one is going to go to the trouble to make a new, complete studio recording of a classic score, do it from the composer's original score, not the movie version! It is indeed a shame that Julie Andrews never played the role of Anna. It was a perfect role for her. Ironically while the acclaimed revival was playing a few years back with Donna Murphy, Julie was plodding through the travesty that destroyed her voice; the stage version of ""Victor Victoria."" Go figure!"
2,Instead................,"I feel that if you like Miss Andrews, then you will love this cd. But i Fell she did not have a strong voice like Deborah Kerr on her CD."
3,Kiddy's Toy,"I loved it as a child. Now that I am an adult, I believe that I wasted my money. I will give it to my little nephew."
5,Great TV Series! Can't go wrong with the Facts of Life!,"Loved this tv series, what is not to like.Girls learn a lot from each other and from Mrs. Garrett5 stars!"
2,Great but..,"I've been buying the facts of life seasons one by one. I now have the first 5 seasons ,So when I went to get season 6 it was nowhere in site . The same goes for seasons 7,8 and 9. I can't find them anywhere. I like the series but I'm very disappointed that I can't find the rest of them. I am on notification if they do come."
5,Great Sitcom!!!,I watched this sitcom when I was younger and now that we have it in DVD I can enjoy it again. It's wonderful to remember those great times.
4,"Facts of Life, season 3","The Facts of Life is a show not shy on taking on issues that teenage girls have to deal with. It mixes serious subjects with humor wonderfully. Season Three is 24 episodes of fun, good writing and good acting"
3,classic tv,"If you want kids to see something descent, and not having to worry about vulgarities, and things they shouldnt see. Older shows like facts of life, will give you good clean entertainment.And for people who are a tad older it gives you a blast from the past, a retro feeling"
4,A Good Thing Getting Better,"While the third season of ""The Facts of Life"" is not my favorite season, it is still part of my favorite series. By season three we have everything that makes ""The Facts of Life"" work: Natalie, Tootie, Blair, and Jo, with their distinct, terrific personalities.It has been said that each Monkee was one quarter the perfect man, and the same can be said for the ""Facts of Life"" women: Blair is beautiful, inside and out, Jo is confident, certainly no push-over, Tootie is out-going and upbeat, and Natalie is gentle and creative. When added together these girls are a showcase of how friendship should work in the real world.As stated, this is my favorite series. Even the opening theme, with the words ""When the world never seems to be living up to your dreams"", makes me glad that as human beings we can dream bigger than our circumstances."
4,The Facts Of Life Rocks!,"THE FACTS OF LIFE was a spinoff series of DIFF'RENT STROKES about the Drummond's former housekeeper Mrs. Edna Garrett(Charlotte Rae)who takes a job as the housemother of a dormitory at a an all-girls only private school called Eastland School which included spoiled rich girl Blair Warner(Lisa Whelchel), tough, but streetwise Jo Polniaczek(Nancy McKeon), overweight impressionable Natalie Green(Mindy Cohn), and the youngest and gossipy Dorothy ""Tootie"" Ramsay(Kim Fields).This 1981-82 Season of THE FACTS OF LIFE is awesome is when this show had its best ratings throughout its whole 9-year run on NBC and takes me all the way back to memory lane to when NBC's motto was ""Our Pride Is Showing"" and when this show was on Wednesday nights at 9PM.This 1981-1982 Season also takes me back to memory lane to when Ronald Reagan was our president and when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 as well."
5,the facts of life - the complete third season,"the facts of life tv series follows 4 teenage girls blair,natalie,jo,and tootie in the eastland school for girls and believe me theres always something going on."
4,You take the good you take the bad,Can't really say too much about this season. I only watched one or two episodes. I bought 3 seasons and tried to watch it all in one weekend and just got tired by this season. I will finish eventually. Still a great show.
3,Operatic voices take away the verve and excitement,"Bernstein started a bad trend with his crossover West Side Story, in which Kiri Te Kanawa and Jose Carreras were painfully miscast. But that version has sold very wel over the years, so now we have MTT condcuting a big symphony orchestra and singers like von Stade and Hampson who try their best but feel all wrong. This is a great score, but here the whole sense of naive sailors on shore leave in the big city, plus the special jazziness of Bernstein in the Forties, doesn't come across. These are very sophisticated people trying to ham up WW II period charm--no thanks."
3,It was....different,"Okay, strait to the point. What was the first thing I noticed when I listened to this CD? The vocalists were too content on acting rather than singing. They really didn't do the singing and the way they acted seemed almost awkward at times. I thought the interpretations were much better on the CD Bernstein's New York which only had selections but were very good. I do still think Kurt Ollmann did wonderful. He's one of my favorite Bernstein interpretationists in his singing than most others even those he usually doesn't get the largest parts. He was also in DG's recording of Candide (as the boat sailor to South America) and Quiet Place (a member of the jazz trio in the Trouble in Tahiti section). I don't know about the other recording but you may wanna try one of those instead. Or maybe not. I don't know. I never did like the London Symphony anyways..."
1,Sound is tinny - not recommended,"The headset itself looked and felt ok for the price - be aware it's stereo not mono - but the sound when using for Skype was tinny and not acceptable for calls. Returned for refund and bought the logitech clearchat pro from Frys (as needed one quickly) which although feels a little flimsy, is excellent sound quality."
3,"not a mono-headset, poor plastic quality, however good sound quality","I ordered this thinking it was a ""mono"" headset but received it with two ear pieces. (make sure you get the Cyber Acoustics with ""mono"" written in the name). Also, the plastic is more of a greenish dull metallic color than the bright silver color pictured. Plastic is of poor quality, however sound quality is GREAT. Ideal for the price, though photo isn't accurate."
1,"warning, religious views presented as facts.","Upon reading this book you will dicover that there are no arguments that can disprove evolution. This book raises doubts about evolution that refuse discussion, not open it up for debate. People who do not believe in evolution believe that god created the earth within the last 10,000 years, despite a fossil record that goes back hundreds of millions of years.You can pretend there is no evolution if you want to look like a childish fool. You can pretend there is an invisible man in the sky who you telepathically communicate with but I call that insanity."
5,"Simply, required reading for EVERBODY.","This book should be required reading for everbody--starting at the High School Level and adding it to the ""reading list."" This book helped me save about $20,000 over three years on my taxes. By helping you to understand the tax ""system"" you'll better appreciate why we pay taxes, how to pay them correctly, how to pay ONLY what you owe, and how to change your spending and savings habits to focus on the tax ramifications. It is written in PLAIN english. Simply superb. Simply the best book on the subject."
4,They don't call them the Classics for Nothing,"The reason books become classics is they convey wisdom pertanent to all ages. This history is one such classic example of Rhetoric, RealPolitik, Politics of Personality, as well as the higher themes of Honor, Loyalty, Duty, Courage. etc.I'd give the book five stars but this translation is only adequate. I loved having the greek on the page opposite the english translation, as well as the convenient, carry-anywhere size of the text.A must read if you wish to be considered truely educated."
4,Avoiding Capital Gains tax,"A worthwhile read if you are involved in selling real estate.Using the book I was able to discuss intelligently the sale of my commercial building with my lawyer,accountant,and buyer."
4,It's not just sex...,"At first I thought this book was going to be full of sexual and erotic material. I was definitely mistaken. The poem that I enjoyed the most was ""Casting Satan"". It was so short yet said so much. ""Before you command Satan to get thee behind you... make sure that God has your back. Otherwise keep that demon where you can see him."" Jessica Holter has alot on her mind in this book, and I for one am glad that she was blessed with the opportunity to let us hear what she had to say."
2,Intimate Betrayal DVD movie,"My greatest beef with this movie is, that the sound track is different from most other movies, which makes it necessary to go through a special setup each time of the DVD player, which then has to be reversed when going back to regular movies again. A time waster at best."
4,Fits my F250.,"I used this as a replacement for the factory one on my 1996 F250 7.3L powerstroke diesel. After seeing a video about how factory caps often lose their ability to hold pressure over time, I decided since I was replacing my water pump anyway, I was going to replace the radiator cap along with it. Fits perfectly, and is CHEAP!"
4,Worth it for the protection it provides,I saw a video on you tube from a well know diesel truck mechanic. He said one of the major issues with a 6.4 powerstroke diesel was the poor design of the Radiator cap. It can lead to MAJOR problem. It was his recommendation to buy this cap. I figured for the price it was a little bit of insurance. Comparing this cap to the stock cap it does have a beefier spring that would keep the seal better. I feel better knowing I took this little bit of insurance out on my expensive truck and it's expensive engine.
2,Not what I expected,The story was not what I expected it to be. Not really appropriate for a young child. I would not buy it again.
1,good bye mog:-(,this book is a tear inducing story it is the saddest book i have ever read and i will never beable to read it again
5,A great little girl's book,My grandaughter loved this book; we babysat for 4 days and I must have read it 4 times a day for each day.
3,Video Review,"I purchased this video in hopes it would be as good as Tammilee's Abs of Steel. The first workout is good, but the second is better if you are looking to feel the ""burn"". I did not attempt the 3rd workout with the step. It seemed a little more aerobic than I like and I do not own or plan to buy a step. I was hoping for more target toning than this video provided, but felt it provided a good workout for the buns. The trick she shows you in the second workout will have you ""bouncing"" in your car, at work or anytime you need to feel that little extra in your buns."
3,Dixie Carter's Yoga Workout Inspires...,"Well, watching this ""not so young"" actress (55 at the time, may she RIP) perform intense Yoga Moves with such ease, was at the least another great inspiration for me to embrace Yoga into my life for good!Why only 3 stars? She's cute and all, but a lil' too giggly for me. I personally like to work out with a more instructional type method...with the instructor explaining and reiterating the importance of the breathing techniques, and careful placement of the feet, knees, hips etc. during the practice of each Yoga Posture.It was nice to see her variety of cute workout attire from 1 1/2 Decades ago :-)"
2,Good video but not for people with knee problems,I enjoy this video but it is not one of my favorites. Some of the movements are awkward for your knees. The last segment #3 is not intended for people with knee problems and she states this. I have had complete reconstruction of my knee and I am not able to do the last segment. I tried it once and lasted about two minutes; it is very jarring to the knee. I love most of Tamilee's videos but this is not one of her best.
2,average video,"I really enjoyed this video on the whole. It will certainly get your buns in shape within a couple of weeks. The only negative part of the video was that some of the views of Tamilee were inappropriate. It seems as though the video was trying to focus on her body as opposed to the routine. On a number of occasions, we are shown Tamilee's bare buttocks in her thong fitness outfit. This is totally unprofessional! It is obvious that she wanted to expose her rear end during the video to sell more copies! Is it really necessary to walk around without any clothes on to sell your video?"
5,A workout that is easy to stick to,"Dixie makes the workout enjoyable enough that you forget you are truly workingout! I have tried other programs and stoped very soon after. Here I look forward to each workout, even if it means before bed on those really busy days. As with everyone else, I feel her voice and humor are a bonus to the workout."
5,I was there!,"I was there when the DVD for this was recorded. Seeing Jason live is blissful.....you just fall into the emotion that is being sent from Jason's passion for spreading God's message through his songs and music. Check out Between the Earth and Sky........you will see and hear what I mean when you listen to the commentary on making ""beautiful people"". There are no pretentions. He's just a person with a message to deliver."
2,Changes the story,"The main plot of this story is that a killer is trying to kill millions of kids by putting on his scary masks. But, it kind of ruins the Halloween series. What I mean is after you make a series, you never want to go off the subject. A Nightmare on Elm Street didn't, Friday the 13th didn't, and Hellraiser didn't."
1,Dire Horror film lacking one vital ingredient--Michael Myers,"This is a very lacklustere attempt at continuing the `Halloween` franchise. The film does contain some very stylish death scenes, but is very sick in the sense that children are the intended victims. Altogether unpleasant."
1,Michael Myers is back...in the loony bin.,"This Halloween movie was lame. It is the only movie that doesn't have Michael Myers in it, and the only movie in the Halloween series that doesn't have Donald Pleasance in it besides Halloween:H20 because he died after filming of the sixth movie. It also brought an approach on sex and drugs. I would not reccomend this movie to anyone and probably wouldn't stay awake through it again."
1,Not Good,Halloween 3 does not have Michael Myers All it is is a mad scientist plans on murdering evry trick or treater in the world.No reason for making it. Brief Clip of the original Halloween shown
2,where the hell are you Michael?,"This movie is readly bad. It has some decent special effects, but thats it.The acting was bad,the plot was also bad and all I can say is,""Michael Myers,come back!!!!"""
3,A Bizarre Sidestep that Adds Nothing to the Mythology,"A bizarre sidestep that breaks the momentum of the Michael Myers-fueled franchise, H3: SEASON OF THE WITCH adds nothing to the mythology. Carpenter favorite Tom Atkins returns as a doctor investigating a series of suspicious deaths connected to Conal Cochran, a toy manufacturer whose ubiquitous line of ghoulish Halloween masks may not be as innocent as it seems. Though the movie suffers from inconsistent pacing and an ill-advised attempt at social consciousness - vaguely stabbing at making a statement about crass commercialism... or holiday excess... or the Irish... Latex products? - it nonetheless achieves a creepy, desperate quality that gets under your skin in the end."
3,good but not great,i saw it no myers a bit slow but it is quite good why did they call it halloween 3 not just season of the witch
2,I poop in the name of this movie!!!,"What the @#$% dude, Halloween is supposed to be SCARY and it's supposed to include MICHAEL MYERS, the guy who the HALLOWEEN MOVIES ARE ABOUT!!!!!!! Don't even watch this show it is not even scary!!!!Scariness - 5.5/10Sound - 6/10Acting - 8.5/10Gore - 8.8/10Don't waste your time or money!"
1,Very Poor,"OK so everyone knows that Michael Myers isn't in Halloween 3 and that is strange, hence the name HALLOWEEN since all of the other films have Michael in them. But just because Michael isn't in Halloween 3 doesn't make it bad. What makes it bad? Practically everything. It was a very childish and stupid plot with okay actors, but not that great. There is nothing at all good about this movie! If you are a big Michael Myers fan than be prepared to be dissapointed."
1,Halloween 3: Season of the Witch,"Halloween 3 is one of the suckest Halloween films of all. No Michael Myers, not even the Witch itself. So why Season of the Witch? I don't know. Halloween and the others kick ass. Halloween H20 is one of Michael Myers latest and I'm hoping he returns toward to the 8th chapter in the Halloween series."
3,A refreshing break from Michael Myers,"This is the red headed step child of the series. Halloween 3 has nothing to do with the Michael Myers storyline, THANK GOD!! How many times are they going to kill Michael and bring him back in another ridiculous sequel?Halloween 3 was suppose to kick off a series of halloween movies with different storylines. Why they ever resorted back to Michael Myers I'll never know.I find this the most interesting film in the series. Very odd and offbeat. You'll find that most diehard Halloween fans ignore this chapter.It had wonderful poster campaigns, if you do an internet search for the variety of posters, you'll be amazed."
3,"Okay Movie, Horrible Cover","I'm not going to bother reviewing this movie, because everyone's seen it. My gripe is, why do they keep changing great box covers on horror movies? The original cover to this movie was truly one of the creepiest I've ever seen, and now it just looks stupid. The same thing was done to Halloween 2 and Children of the Corn. The thing that gets me is, the original covers were just like the original movie posters, so why go and change them? Maybe it's for the same reason that they can't make a good horror movie anymore, they're just incompetent."
3,I hated the ending,"The movie was okay at best. It definitely wasn't bad, but I don't think it could be classified as good either. First of all, don't be deceived by the title. The movie could just as easily be called Season of the Witch, without the Halloween in front. It has absolutely no involvement with Michael Myers, Laury Strode, Sam Loomis, or any of the Halloween gang. Second of all, don't think of it as a horror movie, although in the end, I guesss that's what it really is. Many parts of the movie seemed like they should be in an action movie, not a horror movie. And last of all, the ending is incredibly dismal. In some cases, I like macabre endings. But this is just too horrible for my taste. But despite all of the flaws I just listed, the movie was still okay. I suggest you watch it. You won't love it, but you'll probably enjoy yourself."

2,"A trick, no treats!","No Michael Myers, No point!This film is totally oblivious to the original series as this should not really be titled as a halloween sequel. It may have worked better if it had just been called SEASON OF THE WITCH minus the halloween 3 title. I'm collecting all the halloween films, but I will leave this one out. Very unimpressive. Fans will be dissapointed."
4,Halloween III Collectors edition,"sept 2012a big event for Halloween fansshout factory release a 2 Disc collectors edition of Halloween III, it's a long time coming aswellthe first release was from Universal back in 2003, terrible release it's barebones, just a trailer and productions notes for the extrasand the audio and visual quality is terribleso scrap the Universal 2003 versionI Don't mind the film, cause it doesn't have Michael myers in it it's still a good thriller/Horror to watchfor any Halloween fan buy the Halloween III collectors edition DVD or blu-ray from shout factory, definitely worth the moneythe picture and audio are excellent 10/10 much better than the 2003 universal releasehas making of Documentary with cast and crew and 2 audio commentaries and more this shout factory release is the best version you'll ever getif you already have the 2003 universal release try and sell it for what it's worth which isn't muchand get the shout factory release."
4,4 stars best Halloween yet,"I say best Halloween yet having only watched the first two prior as if the 4th movie isn't out yet. I don't hate a series for changing it up, however to be fair I think companies maybe ought to change the title or something. My reason why, if you are watching Friday the 13th you want Jason and Halloween Michael Meyers. However like with the movie Jason Goes to Hell that movie was actually good and fun. This movie broke the mold and it worked, I wouldn't have minded Michael Meyers being in it tho. Maybe as the one running the factory, however I understand you can't win every fight plus it's nice not to have a single man(who isn't human by any means) stalking people all day and night. Give them this one they probably needed sometime to get the writers block out."
5,A fine dark symbolistic horror film,This is one of my favourite films of the 1980s. It is a fine dark horror film with a symbolistic fairy story built into it which depicts TV destroying childhood and children's minds. The symbolism has adults as robots conspiring with the commercialism behind TV. The film makes great use of halloween imagery and is very atmospheric.
1,(0 stars) Where's Michael Myers?,"This movie is one of the stupidest and most boring movies of all time. Don't watch it because it has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the series. Michael Myers isn't even in it! The plot centers around some pumpkin but I don't really remember because I fell asleep during it.This shows that the people making the Halloween movies are really confused. I mean seriously, what the heck was the point of this movie? Why is it part of the series?This is trash that's meant to be kept in the trashcan and not in a DVD case."
1,CRAP,"the halloween films r pretty good but they didnt hav good plots but they were excellent.But when i saw this movie at a local movie store i bought it.I made the biggest mistake of my life!there is stuff that dont make sense lik snakes comin out of kids mouths and ppl who bleed green blood.And most of all where the f*** is MICHAEL MYERS?the director wanted 2 get away from the psychotic madman and made this.Well my opinon is i lik psychos such as freddy krueger, jason voorhees, leatherface, and the leprechaun slashin ppl up not a dumb movie about weirdcommercials where wen u wear a mask a snake coms outt a yer mouth and destroy a GREAT collection of slasha films.So my opinion next tym stay wit tha psycho DONT pursue anotha stupid plot!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,I didnt like any of the Halloweens anyway,"WTF??????Note to movie makers out there: Never ever make a movie, then make a sequel that has absolutely no connection to the first, or in this case, second as well.This movie would never have even been seen by the amount of people as it has if it was titled with a different name instead of an insulting attempt at cashing in on Halloween name. Throughout the entire film I was waiting for Michael Myers to somehow enter the scene. I thought he might have been one of their henchmen things, but nope, the credits rolled and I wondered how far you can Frisbee away a DVD.Don't waste your time with this one. I don't know how somebody can make a story line over 2 movies, then do something completely different with the 3rd, then go back to the story line of the 1st two films for the next 100 sequels."
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,"I seen this movie because a Halloween all nighter wason a feseveral years ago and I have to say this is theworst movie I've ever seen. The plot is dreaful... Somerich dude is trying to kill kids by selling masks thatmelt thier faces as they watch some lame TV program.How dumb is that?Then we have Tom Atkins the big hero. What???? You meanthis is the guy we are supposed to root for? Somepersonality less old man that honestly isn't much of ahero is all. In fact, he shouldn't have been in a movieanyway. If John Carpenter was just trying to take thisseries in a different direction he went all wrong aboutit. Sure the Michael Myers series really wasn't all thatgreat, but it wasn't bad enough to have the series turnedlike this. What a horrible movie!"
1,A horrifyingly bad horror movie,"This movie really blew chunks. The acting is boring, there isn't a storyline until the end, and everything else is bad. Take my advice and don't see this movie, see Halloween Ressurection."
1,HORRIBLE!,"This is unbelievably horrible! This movie dosen't even have anything to do with Michael Myers. Why would anyone keep the name ""Halloween"" and make it about some man making mask??? If you like boring, and disappointing movies this is the movie to see."
1,Dont Let the Good Reviews Fool You!!!,"This Is By Far the worst Horror Movie ive ever watched.I really cant say anyting else about it.It could have been good,but the Director didnt succesfully put the story to film.Its worth watching once,Just so you say youve seen the worst horror movie ever made."
1,Halloween III,"This movie absolutely sucks, it has nothing to do with Halloween or Halloween II. They wasted their time on this one. What the hell are they thinking not involving Michael Meyers or at least his mask. Duh!"
3,Ummm....well......,"Why did they call this Halloween 3? It could have been called Silver Shamrock Murders or something. I mean, don't get me wrong, I like the story line of the movie, but to associate it with the Halloween franchise was ignorant. You'd never see Rob Zombie doing something stupid like this."
4,This is REALLY Halloween,"OK, forget about the title, this film is not related to the others in the series. However, this may be the creepiest. We have witchcraft, androids and an end-of-the-world story here. The cinematography is great, with lots of darkness, yet little grain in the image to speak of. The music score is terrific, minimal and similar to what much of today's ambient music sounds like. The acting is decent, Dan O'Herlihy is a great villain, Tom Atkins is a convincing guy-who-gets-caught-up-in-something-big and Stacy Nelkin plays a great '80's chick. So why do so many trash this flick- Because Michael Meyers wasn't in it. This film also bombed at the box office. Carpenter and Hill were trying to bring about a series of films related to Halloween, one a year. Had this movie not done so poorly at theatres, we may have had many more gems come after. Oh well, enjoy this one, it's pretty good."
3,"AN OKAY MOVIE, BUT IN NEED OF SOME WORK","... It doesn't have Michael Myers, but I really didn't care, although it would have been better if they didn't include the Halloween title. It is not really scary, but some moments make you go like, ""Whoa!"" or a sarcastic way of ""okay."" This movie had a really good plot development and gave the true meaning of Halloween, according to Celtic legends, also mentioned in Halloween 2 and 6. It had an awesome ending, but the movie had a really annoying theme song:Have a happy halloween, halloween, halloween, have a happy halloween, silver shamrock! It is the tune to London Bridge is Falling Down. The music scores are okay, but has a very dark mood, which I'm not saying is bad, but makes the movie way more depressing. This movie is a good way to waste 2 hours, and good for a backround movie at a halloween party, but can get really boring at sometimes."
3,i cant get the song out of my head from the movie. the,it was pretty good movie it has one disturbing scene that i had to turn my head where little buddy watchs the tv with his mask on. the song in it silver shamerock halloween is pretty freaky
3,"8 more days til Halloween, Halloween, Halloween...","Okay, admittedly this one has nothing to do with the previous two HALLOWEEN films, but it's not THAT bad. I would certainly put it ahead of any of the resoundingly awful sequels that came after it (yes, even H2O). I believe that people are exaggerating when they say this is the worst horror movie EVER. Go watch NAIL GUN MASSACRE or MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE and then come back and tell me what the worst horror movie is! Sheesh.SEASON OF THE WITCH does suffer from some silliness, but no more so than other B-movies, and at least it has a mostly coherent plot. I would be lying if I said this film scared me, but I do enjoy watching it as a campy treat. Try watching it and ignoring the HALLOWEEN appelation, and I think you will like it better.5/10 for trying. Gotta love that Silver Shamrock ditty!"
3,Sil-verr shamrock!,"Watch this film as you'd watch a 70s exploitation horror film. It's goofy and gory - and anyone who's seen Carpenter's ""In the Mouth of Madness"" will be shocked at the similarities in the storylines. NO Halloween movie matched up to the original - most were derivative remakes of silent killer stalking innocents. I'm pleased that someone tried to make a sort-of original film in the series (even though it turned out kinda goofy) Also, the end of Halloween 3 is probably the best of ANY horror film (hehehe...) and the commercial for the masks is just too great to be believed. Rent it when you have absolutely nothing to do and be prepared for mindless gore!"
4,Most original of the series,"Pay no heed to those with one track minds, who can not get over the fact that Mike Myers is not in this movie. This is the direction the Halloween series should have followed. While I love Halloween, the concept is tired. Man in mask chases girl. Girl injures man in mask. Man in mask plays dead. Repeat. Actually, repeat for 6 more movies. I am glad that this movie took the chance with a new concept. I really hate how companies drag out marketable characters through successively worse sequals. The story is far more creative, and has more at stake than a couple people in the same town. I feel this movie captures the spirit of the holiday more so than the Mike episodes. Highly underrated."
2,Disapointing.,"I actually give the makers of this movie credit for trying to do something different then the standard slasher sequal. The whole anthology concept for this series might have had potential. Unfortunately this film is kind of a miss. Witchcraft, robots, science fiction, magic masks that turns peoples' heads into bugs, a really bazaar plot for mass murder. It is watchable, so there is a certain entertainment value there, even if it isn't that good."
5,Loaded with special features,"A pretty underrated movie that would have much more acclaim if not for the ""Halloween III"" banner above the title. This disc is great for collectors as the special features are top shelf. Two audio commentaries and a half hour retrospective documentary. A solid transfer and good sound. Recommended for those who watch the extras."
1,wut the heck,i have not seen this movie yet but i dont want to. i think it is a disgrace to all halloween movies. it doesnt even have michael myers in it.
1,Worthless,This has nothing to do with the Halloween franchise in any way. i only own this because for some stupid reason its part of the Halloween collection. either way this is not worth watching and is completley useless. this movie is proof that anyone can make a terrible sequal when they try something different and far fetched. save your money and get the rest of the Halloween movies instead of this.
1,Trash!,"This never should have been made.I mean,what kind of movie kills off children? That is just morally sick.I wouldn't waste a single cent on this piece of garbage."
1,No.,"Just....don't. I tried watching it, I really did...this neither follows nor references the Halloween franchise, and lacks *any* discernible theme or plot. Seriously - what did I just watch 40 minutes of?"
1,Don't bother!,"I love the Halloween movies, so, one would think that this would be part of the others. It had nothing to do with Michael Myers at all. Completely seperate movie and they should not have been allowed to call it Halloween III."
1,it makes no sense,"Halloween III has nothing to do with Michael Myers and the orginal Halloween. The box office sales were even below Halloween II,the movie was so poorly made. That Halloween IV,was called,the return of Michael Myers to boost ticket sales. Halloween II-H20 are nothing more than a joke as Halloween 4,5,6 show an ageing Donald Plesance."
1,what were they thinking?!,"oh... my... God! this movie totally screwed the whole HALLOWEEN series! what the heck was Carpenter thinking?! why would he want to screw his rep as a once admired director for this! did michael want to take a year off or something? spend halloween with the wife and kids?, i mean, come on! a word to the wise: DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU HAVE A REDICULOUS AMMOUNT OF BOOZE IN YOUR SYSTEM!"
2,Time to make corrections,"Ok, lets get this right out in the open for some of the other reviewers that do not know what they are talking about. John Carpenter, had NOTHING to do with this movie. The only one he ever had anything to do with was the orginal. Which by the way is by far the best of the bunch. I don't really even count the others at all. Well, maybe the second one, it wasn't too bad.As for this movie, I'll be honest I've never even watched it. I guess I'll rent it someday and see what it's all about. At least it doesn't have Michael Myers in it, which is good, cause in my opinion he died after the second movie. I do think they should of changed the name of this though. I mean, every Halloween movie has had a different director, naming this one part III doesn't even make any sense at all."
1,False sequel...misleading title,"If you think Halloween 3 is a sequel to Halloween 2, then I am afraid that you are in for a disappointment!! This movie has absolutely nothing in this world to do with Halloween or Michael Myers. It is a morbid disgusting movie about brainwashing children with a computer chip hidden inside Halloween masks. Why they titled this movie Halloween 3 is beyond my comprehension. What it does is interfere with the sequence numbers of the Halloween series. Don't waste your money on this movie..it is not worth it!"
1,HALLOWEEN 3! IT'S BORING,"John Carpenter made the Stupidest movie ever made! No Myers, No DR. Loomis & No Laurie Strode! This SUX!!!! Big Time!"
1,"Wow. But wow, is this movie bad.","I really hate this movie. It's so bad I can barely describe it in words. I despise any film that uses children as nothing more than sucker-punching props to inspire sympathy when they're completely undeveloped, like the rest of the characters in this trash.If you really wanna see what's in this movie, go to [...] to see my video review of it. Get ready to laugh."
1,Worst movie ever made!,"This movie has nothing to do with Michael Meyers, so why is it titled Halloween III?!!!"
3,It could've been better!,"All in all, I liked this movie in spite of itself. The premise was intriguing and the principal actors were more than up to the task of adding a certain psyche to their respective characters. However, there were some marked moments where credulity was stretched to its absolute limit particularly when there was little motivation by the ""bad guy"" for doing such a terrible thing other than ""this was the way we did it in the old country"". The script should have been developed with an aim for a little more plausibility. Other than that I had a lot of fun watching it."
1,The night he never came back...,"this movie was dull, silly, and completly pointless. the worst thing about it, was that there was no Michael Myers for crying out loud! instead, they made up other goofy things like 'evil masks', and stuff like that. it had nothing to do with Halloween's 1 and 2. the thing through out the whole movie, was comletly rubbish! i advice everyone in capital letters, to AVOID THIS MOVIE! if i could vote this movie below a one, i would. remember, avoid it at all costs!"
1,Season of the Witch,"Okay, I'll admit that because of the series, I thought Michael Myers was going to be in it.Then I read that what they had planned to do was do different halloween horror movies, using the Halloween name, and no Michael Myers. Okay. Fine. I don't really care of MM anyway.So, knowing all THAT, I saw the movie.And honestly? I thought it sucked. You're waiting and waiting.. and okay yes, bugs are gross.. There's just so much that's unexplained.And.. yeah the ending is bizarre and creepy a little bit.. but not as much as I would have liked.I actually can say that I liked Nightmare on Elm Street 2 better. And that's one of the worst sequels in the world.I say avoid this movie unless you are INCREDIBLY curious.. And remember, you won't see the William Shatner masked maniac in this one."
1,"Wasted ""Witch""","Stupid piece of trash that is the black sheep of the ""Halloween"" franchise, because, it has nothing to do with the Michael Myers saga.After the death of a toyseller, a doctor and the toyseller's daughter investigate his mysterious death. There snooping leads to the Silver Shamrock mask making company and to it's owner - a warlock bent on destroying the planet by way of his magical melting masks, that children wear on Halloween, turning them into slimy snakes, bugs and venomous insects.""Universal Pictures"" bought the rights to this turd, along with ""Halloween II"", hoping to take the franchise into a different ""Twilight Zone"" style direction, with a new ""Halloween"" film supposedly coming out every season. Instead the studio put the series right into the toilet. John Carpenter wrote the music and serves as executive producer (with Debra Hill) and Nick Castle (""The Shape"" from the original) directs this piece of celluloid waste. Stick with the original."
1,"Don't buy this unless you want the complete set, it STINKS!",The movie really stinks. Only buy it if you're a collector and need it to complete your Halloween dvd set. Most horror movie fans consider this the worst horror sequel ever made. It isn't even about MICHAEL MYERS!
1,HALLOWEEN?????,"This isn't a Halloween film and the plot was absolutely horrible, this film should get one star instead of two."
1,This movie really puts a damper on the series.,This movie wasn't as good as the first two Halloween movies. It has nothing to do with the whole Myers plot and this is its main problem. It just seems like there was very little thought and effort put into this movie.
1,This was stupidest movie ever...,"I hate this movie! This wasn't scary, this had awful music and this was very boring. And the darkness all the time gave me a headache. Halloween and Halloween H20 are much better than this! I bought this video because it cost only $3 but now I think that it was too much...Don't even bother!"
2,It Ain't Awful But....,"This should be without the Halloween tag. This movie is separate from any in the series and shouldn't be counted. Still, it ain't awful but it's ok. For a 80's movie it's okay but still, not quite good nor enjoyable. The acting is defensible but the plot is kinda weak."
3,"No Michael, but still classy",Halloween III is not a solid horror film. Definitely not a sequel in respects of a follow-up to the Myers storyline. But still the classical John Carpenter feel is here and many moments of typical horror fare are administered to livin' things up a bit. Not to mention a wonderful score!
2,alright movie,"this was cool but it didnt have michael in it. though he wasn't in it it was better than halloween 6, a hell of alot better"
4,A true horror classic!,"One of the most disturbing horror films I can remember! Michael Meyers got old, and this one was a surprise...no Michael Meyers! This was truly a scary Halloween movie, and I bring it out every Halloweeen, and still have to cover my eyes in a couple parts of the movie. That incessant jingle in the mask commercial by Silver Shamrock, the company that wants to kill thousands of little trick or treaters, is haunting, and all I can say is--this is one diabolical film with one shock after another. The soundtrack is enough to make you shudder, too. A classic."
3,MICHAEL MYERS IS IN HALLOWEEN III,Just wanted to say in case it wasn't in the other revies that MICHAEL MYERS IS in fact in HALLOWEEN IIIwatch for it..
3,"So what, no Michael, take it for what it is......................","Yeah the story is ridiculous, stonehenge power, lazers, exploding masks, killing all the children, etc. But it is moody fastpaced, great soundtrack, and an ending that is satisfactory. First off Stacey Neilken should never act, she sucks. Atkins is O.K., much better in The Fog. Some people believe this is the first film to show a child killed, wrong. Alex Kitner in Jaws on the raft was more horrific. My only question, where can I purschase one of these masks? I would love to see my ex-wife's head explode into beetles and snakes. Make that two masks, her mother could use one too. Happy Halloween."
3,Halloween 3 ?,"Unfortunately, John Carpenter made a big mistake when he named this movie Halloween 3. Audiences did not take too kindly to this film due to the lack of Michael Myers and the fact that Halloween 3: Season of the Witch did not relate at all to the previous Halloween movies. I think this film would have been more successful if the title had just been ""Season of the Witch"".But let's look at what was good about this movie. It is a good murder mystery in a way which includes some super natural events, the movie is tense at certain points, and the ending is surprising.However, I only give this movie 3 stars because I have seen better horror movies than ""Season of the Witch"" and I think John Carpenter should not have ended here with the Halloween series."
4,"This is a very good, original flick","So big deal, the movie does not feature Michael Meyers. This is still a very creepy horror film that does not get enough credit. At the time it was released, the special effects were pretty cool and the score adds plenty to the atmosphere. I definitely recommend this for someone who is in to horror."
2,Time was kind to this movie (2 and half stars on the collectors edition),Let me preface what I'm about to say that taste is subjective and this is only one persons point of view. With that said when this movie first came out I remember not liking it very much. I liked the idea of trying to create a different story with this movie. I'm not sure if the execution of this plot really clicked for me. I saw myself trying to re-work the movie which isn't really the point. I would rate this movie 2 stars which is a half star better than I would have gave it when I saw it in the theater 30+ years ago.The video collectors edition has some nice bonus stuff and behind the scenes footage making it more worthwhile than just the plain movie. Again I actually like this movie better now than I did back then and it's probably due to this well put together bonus edition.
4,"It's not Michael Meyers , but this movie is still good","if it weren't for the title this movie ratings would be much higher. when you see the name Halloween, you're expecting michael meyers and dr. loomis, so right away your misled and have negative thoughts. But if you really watch the movie, despite the name, its actually pretty good. it kind of reminds me of 'they live' or scanners. Its pretty suspenseful too. I like it, and i would recommend it..."
2,"An attempt to do something different, but just plain bad","It's been a while since I've seen this film, so my memory is rather foggy. The plot has something to do with masks that have become the latest craze among children. What the children (and their parents) don't know is that these masks were crafted by a madman bent on destroying children. On Halloween night, these children have been instructed to watch some commercial or program or something; they haven't been informed that when they watch it, the masks will horribly mutilate their faces or some crap.I really appreciate the effort from John Carpenter to turn the series in a different direction, but this movie really is just plain bad. It's extremely campy (not in a good way), the actors are a bunch of bland no-names, and the plot is just silly. Only see this if you really have to view the entire Halloween series."
3,one of the better sequels.,"Halloween III goes for something different.There is no Michael Myers here.Halloween III is about a corporation that is plotting to kill all of the worlds children with their Halloween masks.When a man is murdered on his way to the factory by a robot,his daughter and a doctor go to the little town to check out what's going on at the Shamrock company.Not a bad movie,just doesn't have anything to do with the previous films in the series,which is a good thing because they've made way to many sequels."
5,Good movie,"I know this Halloween movie has nothing to do with any of the others, there is no Michael Myers character. However, I have always enjoyed this one a lot and wanted to get the dvd. I think it is worth watching, it's not scary but still think that it is a good movie."
1,bad,i thought this would be ok but i mean not a good title people say bad title but some said it was ok but not only is it bad but bad acting bad special efects and kids were pupkins on there head stupid stupid stupid and the death scenes kids shake there heads and die and a guy trieng to take over the world bad plot
1,?????What??????,This movie has nothing to do with the michael myers serial killings!And magical masks that make your head explode?What the hell?This movie sucks bad.
1,"Why, why, why?",This movie absolutely bit the big green weenie. If I have to listen to that jingle one more time....
1,Utter Crap,"This marked the beginning of the end for the franchise. Very original idea, just plain fails. copies F13 part 1 by not having trademark killer in film. series becomes nothing more than a F13 ripoff as Myers tries to become like Jason. He has nothing on him as the next few Halloweens prove"
1,They could have made it good!,I dont even feel like watching it again and seeing if I liked it the second time around. It was very hard for me not to turn it off the first time. I dont look forward to buying the DVD. In fact make it Zero Stars.
1,Halloween III - Don't Waste Your Time,"I am a fan of the ""Haloween"" series of films but have never seen part III (due to eveyone I know saying its terrible). After all these years I wanted to give it an objective chance and was excited to actually watch this film. Please note going into this film I knew Michael Myers has nothing to do with it and was just fine with that. Well - This film is terrible by any standard. I would classify this film more as Sci-Fi and what a far-fetched (even by Sci-Fi standards) plot this was. Sloppy story-line that doesn't flow, horrible acting and the movie moves slow without much suspense. The only question you will ask is ""how much longer is this movie"" after the first 1/2 hour.I love the idea behind doing something different with the movie besides Michael Myers but this one misses badly which is probably why it went back to the Michael Myers theme. Too bad.Believe the negitive reviews you have heard and don't waste your time!"
3,Collectables,"The sad thing for the series is Halloween 3. I DID NOT LIKE the fact Michael was not in the movie, still its not a bod film on its own, I DID LIKE the lead female though very sexy. The spooky atmosphere makes these films. My favourite movies are pts 1-5. Pt 1 - 3 brings me back to my youth and the DVD transfers are fine, if you are after something intelligent, this is not for you, for the films are a fun and entertaining session of good-looking horny teens getting slashed. Not great but what the hell its all popcorn stuff anyway. If anyone is interested in Halloween collectables, email taylor5821@hotmail.com"
2,weird and interesting!,"I remember seeing a glimpse of this film a long time ago and didn't think much of it. A month ago, I watched the whole thing for the first time and thought it was interesting. I know Michael Myers wasn't in it and that's ok. But still, John Carpenter produced it and if anybody's a fan of John Carpenter as I am, it should be part of their Carpenter collection or Halloween collection. One of my favorite things about this movie is the music. I thought John Carpenter did a great job. I bought the soundtrack and my favorite tracks are #1-(the main title) and #9-(the rock). I just didn't get the ending of the movie and as far as the dvd, I was disappointed there were no special features, not even a trailer, but at least the picture and sound are great."
3,I just wasnt into it,"Ok, Im going to be fair about this movie and give it 3 stars for attempting to add something new and fresh to the series,but it just didnt entertain me at all. A Halloween Mask company decides to kill a bunch of kids on Halloween by implanting a chip in the worlds most famous Halloween masks that will explode during the airing of a certain commercial on Halloween night unleashing hordes of bugs and snakes into the childs brain. This movie wasnt suspensful at all it relied more on shockingly gory scenes to make its money. I think this movie would have been better if it didnt have the Halloween name attached to it. Fans of the first 2 movies was disgusted by this movie because it didnt have Micheal Myers in in it. Rated R for graphic violence"
3,Its not all bad,"If this movie wouldn't have been called Halloween 3, it might have been good. I like the story, although its does seem far fetched. It has a little more gore then the first two Halloween films as well. Carpentar is a great director but one small problem with his films. The films in the eightys made by him had all the same music. I noticed it in the movie Escape from New York. Decent film with a great setting. I always like how Halloween is filmed in a town that looks like something outside my door. Check it out and dont think of Myers when you watch this movie. You'll probably enjoy it more."
3,GIVE CARPENTER CREDIT FOR TRYING. :-O,"This installment of Halloween is a strange, but interesting entry in the series. Carpenter didn't want to make ""The Shape"" an on going thing in sequel after sequel, so he decided to try a new story. I give him credit for trying as it is a very cool idea! Imagine a new Halloween movie coming out every couple of years with a completely new a different story.To be truthful, I like the Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm St. films, but they have become silly or almost a self parody over the years. Halloween started out as a great inventive horror movie. Only after Halloween III did they begin to follow the trend of churning out redundant sequels. The DVD transfer is very good for this movie and if your a fan of the series it should not be avoided because Michael doesn't come home ;-b"
2,"Michael , come back , but not right now !","""Halloween III:Season of the Witch"" does not Have Michael Myers in it, but it is still a good movie to watch during the holiday. It deals with a madman toymaker making millions of booby traped masks to harm millions of innocent children on halloween night. But he has to ship them out before Dr.Dan Chilless (Tom Atkins) foils the party! The movie contains: Gory Violence,Language,Adult Situations,and Brief Nudity."
1,Unintentionally Hilarious,"I first saw this in the mid-80's, and even as a pre-teen just laughed myself silly at this ludicrous departure from the ""Halloween"" tradition. Michael Myers, whose relentless earnestness made the first two films horror classics, is conspicuously absent, instead replaced by a ridiculous premise about children being converted into monsters by wearing ""Silver Shamrock"" Halloween masks. The final twenty minutes or so of the film inundate the viewer with a thoroughly annoying, synthesized jingle for the Silver Shamrock company that is memorable because it is some of the most pathetically cheesy music ever to be captured on celluloid. The only things that are scary about this movie are that John Carpenter put his name on it and a movie company actually mass marketed it. Otherwise, everything about the film, from the acting to the special effects, is downright laughable. File this one under ""unintentional comedy."""
1,What witch?,"Why did they call it ""Season of the Witch?"" There's suppose to be a witch in this movie? I really don't like this movie. It has nothing to do with the rest of the series. A factory produces masks with a computer chip installed on them that turns children's heads into snakes and insects. What the heck is the purpose of that! This movie should be on Mystery Science Theatre 3000."
2,"Needs two things, Michael Myers and an ending!!!!!!!!","This movie is extremely violent and gory. I pity myself for seeing it. It has no ending at all. Michael Myers is not mentioned or shown even in the Halloween 1 clip in the movie. This movie was OK but it needed to tone it down a little on the violence and gore. When that poor kid had snakes come out of his head, I felt like I had just seen the worst movie ever. They shoulda juss stuck wit Myers. Here's my advice to the creators, MAKE A SEQUEL! Finish this movie off once and for all, and try to add Michael."
2,Could be much better,Although the Masked michel is not in this moive if it was just titled soemthing els and not even in the series i would still have to say this movie was pritty bad. ITs plot could have used much more developing and well it just wasnt that sacry. The only good part was when the masked turned into snakes and stuff but overall it lacked as a movie even without michel myers i would say to get this movie only if you want to complete you collection but i wouldnt recomend actualy whacting it lol
3,WILDLY UNDERRATED!,"This film is so underrated because there is no Michael Myers! Well, that doesn't mean this is a BAD film! It had a very good plotline! The acting wasn't to great but other than that, this is a good non-sequel! I give it a 6 out of 10!"
2,completed my series,I purchased this movie to complete my HALLOWEEN series. it was the only one I didn't have. As an individual movie its ok but as a 3rd movie in a series its not a good movie.
3,NO MICHAEL MYERS!!!,"I never understood why this movie had nothing to do with the evil serial killer Michael Myers. Instead, it's about an evil old man who owns the Silver Shamrock Mask Company and markets Halloween masks that possess the trick-or-treaters. The only scene with Michael Myers in this movie is during a trailer of the original Halloween on a television in a bar."
2,This franchise needs a good kick in the [bottom],"- Tough, not really a Halloween movie, this movie stunk. Im not giving the movie a bad rank because it doesnt follow the Michael Myers' plot. I really dont care about that. This movie is a ""pod"" movie. But, the storyline was incredible bad, and the acting follows that pattern. Some neat scenes forces me not to give this movie a 1 star..."
5,No Myers? No Problem! Still an above average Halloween film!,"This film may have had a more widely accepted following, had it not been a ""Halloween"" film--but still a wonderful horror film! This film centers on the evil plot of Conal Cochran to distribute his ""custom"" Halloween masks to millions of children. Dr. Challis, along with the help of Ellie Grimbrage, seek to uncover Cochran's evil plan and stop ""the big giveaway at nine."" Worthy of a sequel, Halloween III delivers all the gore and suspense that one could expect from a Carpenter/Hill horror production. Although Myers doesn't make an appearence, Halloween III still stands as ONE of the best horrors of the eighties! Watch this film as an independant film and not a Halloween sequel and perhaps the rivalry amongst Halloween fans towards this film may end.Halloween III delivers!!!"
4,The best of the Halloween movies.,"No Michael Myers. No Jamie Lee Curtis. Totally differnt concept than the other Halloween films. Myself being a huge fan of most horror films, just never have thought much of Halloween. Michael Myers is a lame excuse for a killer. I'm glad this film has nothing to do with that. the movie itself is not that great, but it is better than many horror films, and is rather entertaining. This is a Halloween film for those that thought they didn't like the Halloween movies."
4,I'm gonna say it,"I'm tired of everyone crying over this film because it doesn't have michael myers. MICHAEL myers was Dead! get over it! the series to me ended with 2..John Originally wanted to make a Halloween movie every year, they made him put Myers in 2, he didn't want to! Halloween III I think is a brilliant film! and is too underserving of the bashing it gets.save your bashing for Halloween 5 and 6 if you want to bash Halloween films."
3,Not bad,"All bad reviews aside, this ""sequel"" is not bad. Yeah, it has nothing to do with Michael, but so what? Personally, I feel the music is again chilling (look who composed it) and I admire the limited acting that Atkins has done in films. He has a great prescence that I feel is too underlooked. The mask scenes are pretty gross, but the music, some of the atmosphere (resembles THE FOG), and Atkins make this film one to have for any Carpenter, or Carpenter alumni, fan."
1,Is this really part of the Halloween Series?,"First of all, I am a huge Halloween fan, I have the entire collection (including this one).This was the worst movie in the history of horror movie! It's very unrealistic. People can't turn into bugs and snakes! At least in Halloween 1, 2,4,5,6 and H20 Michael Myers was a ""real"" person.The thought that there is a serial killer is real, but this one, just sucked!It doesn't deserve the 1 star I gave it!"
2,"O.K movie,but where's michael!","Hey carpenter,hey Akkad where's michael?H3 was a good movie,had a good story but just wasn't scary,but not a bad movie.(grade D)"
2,2.5 stars.,"A non-sequel, really. This movie ignores its roots, which are suggested in the title, and travels along a bizarre path. There's no Michael Meyers in this movie. It does have is share of creepiness, but suffers from the absence of John Carpenter's directing and creative force.Rental only."
3,HALLOWEEN 3 IS NO SEQUEL,"NOT A TRUE SEQUEL TO HALLOWEEN 1 AND 2,BUT 3 BORROWS ELEMENTS FROM INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS AND 3 IS ENJOYABLE TO WATCH BUT TO OWN IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE BLOODY EFFECTS ARE COOL TO WATCH AND WHEN PUMPKIN MASKS EXPLODE,SNAKES SQUIRM AROUND THE MASK,AND EVEN A WEIRD KIDS CHANNEL IS TELLING KIDS TO KILL.I LIKED THIS ONE MORE THAN HALLOWEEN PART 2,4,5,7.SO MY ONLY HALLOWEEN SERIES THAT ARE COOL TO ME ARE PARTS 1,3,6,AND 8.THIS ONE IS A FILM TO WATCH,EVEN WITHOUT MICHAEL MYERS IN THE FILM SLASHING TEENS OR ADULTS."
3,Not related to the Halloween movies,"If you don't watch it expecting it to be related to the other Halloween movies, it's ok. It has nothing to do with any of the other Halloween movies."
3,"Bizarre, original yet very interesting.","I have seen this movie and I have to tell you: it is really weird.Silver Shamrock factory is one malicious factory in terms of getting masses of childrem killed with their masks. The effects in this movie are average for that time. yet the daughter of the man killed in the hospital is a fox!!The guy who played Cochran was a man who is intent on killing kids with masks and a commercial that would trigger a laser to fry hte child's head causing him/her to die, decompose and have snakes and many other thigns to come out, really discusting and cool. If you have seen the part of the family in a metal room with no windows, that scenario I told you about is the most weirdest I have ever seen.I have also made a comment on ""Happy Birthday to Me"", a Canadian flick from 1981. I said that in terms of weirdness, it is a 26. For this movie, Halloween 3 from a rating of one to ten is a 23!! Unpredictabe and original and has nothing to do with Micheal Myers storyline."
5,Really Super!!!! Really Scarey!,This is not part of the Halloween Series. I don't know why they call it Halloween 3.It's supernatural and super creep-a-rific!Good Flick for the kiddies to watch before they go trick-or-treatin'...! ESPECIALLY if they're gonna wear Silver Shamrock Masks this year!!!!!The Silver Shamrock jingle is hypnotic and will stick with you for YEARS!!!!YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM!
4,Surprisingly Disturbing,"When this first opened in theatres, I remember being disappointed that the Michael Myers-amok-in-Haddonfield formula had been abandoned. Even so, there is one scene in this movie that so disturbed me I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I think it was one of the first times in American horror movies that a child died horribly on camera. And when shown on broadcast television, or even cable channels like American Movie Classics, the scene is usually trimmed because it's so violent. The plot is surprisingly twisted and comments on television and the way children are manipulated by corporations. If you are able to ignore the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis is not going to show up, you can give yourself over to the tension and thrills. Very definitely a good movie to watch at Hallowe'en time."
3,This is a great film! 3.5 stars really!,"I just wanted to write a review for this film because it gets a bad rap simply because this is the only film in the Halloween franchise that doesn't have Michael Myers as the main character. If this film would have simply been entitled ""Season Of The Witch"" people would probably rate this higher. This movie is a great example of 80's low budget horror movies. The story line is pretty cool too. And for the hardcore Michael Myers fans out there, the last 3 Halloween movies (which all contain this character) are quite simply, horrible! Just plain bad! Ripoffs! Whatever you want to call them, they aren't as good as the original. The argument I'm trying to make is that even if this film had the Myers character, it still would not have been as good as the original. So if you have time to kill, check out this film. It really is pretty good. And John Carpenter's score for the film is also pretty awesome.Rene."
4,Much better than the Previous and Subsequent Ones,"I think of myself as a rather rational and intellectual person who is not prone to excursions into absurdity, however, I find ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" to be a true guilty pleasure. Having not liked any of the Michael Myers-themed films in the series, I did like the direction of this really gross-out one about a businessman with malevolent plans on his mind for the little ""trick-or-treaters"" during the holiday. It does have its unnerving scenes that coincide with the truly horrific subject matter, so it cannot be recommended for the small fry. But, it is a horror flick and it does horrify!"
3,Halloween3 is good despite its difference,Part 3 has some of the most scariest music in the series. Despite the story change this is very enjoyable to watch. The ending cleary tells you their will be a sequel. There hasn't been one yet. I am still waiting. Worth the look. Rent it. Watch with a open mind.
2,whacked out plot!,"There's not many positive things to be said about this movie, except that, in my opinion, it does have the most revolting death scene ever in a horror movie. (the scene where they show the woman's face after the chip shoots a laser into her skull--GREAT make-up work!)"
1,Add To Cart.... NO!,"This movie made me want to scrape turd-shaped photons off of the back of my retinas. Anyone who praised this dogpile is either struck by the popularity of the title or saw it when they were 5 years old and are still trying to hold onto a simpler time in their life. The plot was paper-thin and the acting made me want to wear one of those Silver Shamrock masks in the hope my life would end at any second while watching this shameful reminder that ANYONE can make a movie.I love the Halloween Series (most of it, anyway) but this is crap. Pass on this one, kids!Edit: This movie has nothing to do with John Carpenter or Michael Meyers! Isn't this helpful info?? This movie isn't good. Cult classic maybe, but it is no Evil Dead. Period."
1,THIS IS WHY AMAZON SHOULD HAVE A 0 STAR RATING,"Horrible movie about a stupid company called Silver Shamrock that likes to kill kids using a dumb chip in maskes derived from stone. The acting is horrid and John Carpenter even laughed during an interview and said originally Halloween was going to have different little sub-plots,so basically this movie was going to be recalled since Michael Myers became the main focus of the series. The is one scene where a guy has sex with a women and at the end she is really a robot,which makes absolutely no sense at all. The movie is just a disaster from start to finish,other scenes come to mind like the stupid scenes where a horde of bugs come out of this boys mask and snake later appears out of nowhere. SKIP THIS DVD AT ALL COSTS,I WOULD RATHER WATCH PAINT DRY THEN TO SIT THROUGH THIS [crummy] MOVIE EVER AGAIN"
1,This movie sucked ass! (No Michael Myers!),"This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. No, Michael Myers! I mean, without Michael Myers in a Halloween movie, it's like saying no Jason in a Friday the 13th movie! ThIS MOVIE SUCKED ASS!"
1,Why?... Why?,"How they could call this movie ""Haloween"" I don't know. I understand that was Carpenters Idea, but it was stupid. Micheal Myers is the coolest horror movie killer I can think of, and calling this a sequal to #1, and 2 is an insult to the movies. It wasn't even that scary, and the plot was horrible, even worst than Nightmare on Elm Street, and that is saying something. The only thing I can think of that is good is the director, but he made a terrible mistake with this movie. So I give it a 1 star. For that one factor. People may say this movie is okay and stuff. But a horror movie that has nothing to do with it's prequels, that's not scary almost at all, has a horrible plot, and is just plain stupid, is not worth calling what it is. Dont watch this movie. Maybe, maybe rent it just to see why it is such a bad movie, and then you can tell all your friends that you just saw a horrible movie. Well, that's all I have to say."
1,beyond horrible,"This is THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! Seriously! The original Halloween is great, but this movie... ugh! I'm someone who usually enjoys cheesy low budget pictures as long as they are amusing. This movie seems like it would be amusing: the story involves killer robots and a mad scientist who wants to kill everyone on halloween. But it is far from amusing. It is extremely bad. Not bad in a goofy way, but bad in a nasty, unpleasant way. It is needlessly and excessivly gory, it has nothing to do with the rest of the series, and the guy who plays the hero looks like a gorilla. There are no words that would describe how horrible it is. To find out, you have to watch it for yourself - but please, don't! You will regret it for the rest of your life."
1,Only for the Die Hard Halloween series fans,"I honestly dont know what the deal was with this movie at all. It had nothing at ALL to do with any of the other halloween movies, and even if they hadnt of been tied it together with the halloween film series it still would have sucked because in my opinion it has no story line, is not scary at all, and has a terrible ending. Anyway dont waste your time unless your a DIE hard halloween series fan."
1,"Simple, stupid, and a horrible movie!","I cant believe they would disgrace such a good horror series with this piece! This film is a disgrace to film making and acting, well hell, really the whole movie industry. I cant not recommend this enough. I thought the film modern vampires was bad, but that makes modern vampires look like a movie gem! The writer of this hasnt made another movie since, and for good reason! He makes the rest of the horror writers & the HALLOWEEN movie series look horrible. I would recommend ANY of the other HALLOWEEN movies, but not this. And if you liked it, you couldnt know anything about movies, especially horror movies"
5,Babes In Arms.,Possibly the best of the Garland/Rooney partnership movies (Babes on Broadway.Strike Up the Band) Collectors and fans will not be disappointed.
4,What an interesting read!,I have always been interested in the advanced Native American tribes. This book did not disappoint me. There were many new facts that I had not learned before. The main reason I gave this book just four stars is that the author became quite repetitive. ISomeone who has never read anything about these tribes will be fascinated.
5,"If you're fascinated with pre-columbian SA History, this is a must read!!!!",This book is a delightful read. Lots of pre-conceived beliefs corrected and put into context.Very enlightening book. Heavily researched.
5,Truly revelatory,"Charles Mann offers a throughly researched volume of new revelations regarding Native American societies prior to the repeated cataclysms wrought by European diseases. Cities rivaling any in Europe. Anthropogenic landscapes. Domestication of plants and the advent of agriculture. Monuments as old as thoses of Egypt. Monumental sculptures. Astronomical calendars. Mathematics, complete with zero and positional notation.A great synthesis of current archeological and botanical discoveries and hypotheses."
4,Fills in historic info,"So much about the earliest populations of the Americas. Fascinating and very informative. Differing opinions are offered, but in any case I now have an appreciation of a portion of history that was never exxplained."
3,interesting but needs editorial cutting,"Very interesting book, but the editor did not do enough cutting, in my opinion. It is oddly organized, but not disorganized, which can cause a loss of focus as one plows through the massive detail. There is an uneven density of detail across the span of the book. The Appendixes are deftly done and quite fascinating."
4,I LOVED 1493 and liked 1491 for other reasons..very different material in both.,He is a prolific and experiencial writer the best kind.He reasearches for up to fifteen years before he puts it on paper. A writers writer.Excellent!
2,product summary,"I purchased two books. One matched the description as to quality and the other was not even close to the quality that was stated when I placed the order. One book is in great shape and the other was not in good shape at all. So, I am not pleased with it at all."
2,"Informative, but...","Expected it to focus on pre-1492. Much of the book can't help but include post 1492 with inferences to what it was like before. Considered it a daunting task to write such a book, and still can see it as not really achieved to the level it suggests it might."
4,Very well researched and well written. Amazing author,Charles C Mann is an excellent historian and author. The book is a wealth of knowledge. It's not a novel or page-turner but you will definitely have a pretty authentic idea of life during these times!
4,Not Your School Lessons,"This book draws on many resources that are not easily available. It paints pictures of mature cultures that thrived and died before Columbus ""discovered"" this land. We need to learn the observational skills that helped them understand the enviorment and use it well. Failure to do so spells the end of cultures."
4,This guy has a Brobdingnagian vocabulary!,"I enjoyed this in much the same way as Guns, Germs, and Steel. Unlike Jared Diamond, who is a scientist in his own right, Charles Mann is a journalist. The difference I thinks this makes is that he tended, more than Diamond, to explore division and debate within the scientific community on quite a few of the issues he brings up (such as the viability of concentrated populations in the pre-Columbian Amazon, or the estimated population of the Western Hemisphere at the time of Columbus's arrival). Like Diamond, though, it's a book that distills a wide variety of scientific disciplines and conveys them in an accessible way to the layperson. One caveat - his vocabulary is Brobdingnagian! (to borrow an adjective he used to describe the appetite of passenger pigeons). I think it's a must-read for all U.S. History teachers. There is just too much omitted from textbooks, even college-level textbooks, on the societies and cultures of the Western Hemisphere pre-1492."
5,Enlightying,"If you like Jared Diamond, you must read this one. Jared really didn't do much research on the Americas, Charles did quite a good job. Outstanding. I just wish that the basic would filter into our official education systems"
4,Very thorough survey of the Americas in 1491,"I was expecting this book to be more of a narrative on what life was like in 1491. Instead, it's an examination of scholars and lay persons slowly uncovering the previously unknown or misunderstand realities of 1491. Not what I was looking for, but good nonetheless.Could help but feel bad for the natives for what they've been put through."
1,One boring book,"I'v read some boring books before but this one takes the cake. I couldn'g even finish it. It jumped around from one time period and civilization to another. I love history, but I couldn't even remember any significant event that stood out in the book."
4,History and Travel,"The commentary by previous reviewers about supplanting the myths about the Americas with new information and reliable evidence is one of the most lasting impressions from the material contained in this book.The positive side of reading this book was that it begot a great appreciation for the Americas, which, at least in my schooling, seemed to be left-out of the discussion of early history. The title was so appropriate because I had always started history of the ""new world"" from 1492.One star was not given only because to me the book felt a bit fragmented at times, but that is to me and I do not have a great deal of knowledge about early civilizations and related disciplines.However, reading this book piqued my curiosity so much that I went to see the ruins in Caral (Supe), Peru and am yearning to learn more. So, by any measure, the purchase and time spent reading was well worth it."
3,"Poorly organized, but interesting material","This book was very interesting. I learned a lot about the early Americas, and I am glad that I read it. I thought the author explored a wide range of present thought on pre-Columbus Americas, and fairly presented differing points of view.However, I would not call it ""highly readable"" or ""a good read"" as other reviewers have. Frankly, having read some of these reviews before reading the book, I found the book a surprise. It was a difficult read. I read hundreds of books per year, but this one was a struggle. The author continuously jumped between subjects and time periods, and I found it difficult to follow his point in many places. It was a real struggle to finish this book. I kept putting it down and reading other books, before forcing myself to go back to this one, since I really did find the subject matter interesting.So, although the book did contain interesting information, it would have been much better with decent editing."
4,Good Read,This is an excellent book. Well researched. A little heavy sledding in some places. Author does a fair job of showing where he is speculating and where he is reporting.
3,1491,"Very detailed, but compelling. The research must have been exhaustive. Changes the way I look at my early education about the ""new"" world."
2,A Disappointment,"Although I did enjoy part one, it was not about pre-Columbus, but post Columbus America. I could not finish parts 2 or 3, as I found them entirely disorganized and confusing. The text seemed to skip back and forth between peoples and times. The content seemed based on speculation rather than fact. I did not have a feeling that the author was really knowledgable or credible. I would not recommend this book."
4,1941,I found the book very interesting. it was a lot different than what we had beentaught in school. it had a lot of new incites.
4,1491,Excellent documentary of pre-Columbian civilization in the Americas. Well written and thoroughly researched.
4,Worlds that went before us.,"Given our technologies, we may be falsely complacent about our level of knowledge about the native populations of our own continent. I think there is a certain amount of parochialism that dictates our feeling that a big enough, advanced civilization cannot just vanish. Therefore, we wistfully assure ourselves that our own time will not just vanish. This book takes a different view and discusses a number of societies that had established organized, technological worlds. Technology doesn't just mean computers. In the past other tools and knowledge were used to extend the reach of man, sometimes past our current ability. This is a fascinating book."
3,A disappointment,"This title and blurbs sounded intriguing and I had high hopes for some real insights. It delivers a few things, but way too much time is spent on academic debates, most of which should be in footnotes (but then we'd have a far shorter book). I'd subtitle the book as ""the little known adventures of obscure academics"". Not what I expected."
3,Interesting - but painfully verbose,"I bought and read this book on pre-Columbian America prior to purchasing the author's current book on `the Columbian exchange.' He shows how North and South Americas had thriving Indian cultures, societies, and empires. He describes artifacts which were buried for centuries before being uncovered by modern archeologists. While enjoying the historical overview, I was driven up the wall by the author's needless and pointless digressions. Lengthy descriptions of bad roads on which he rode to this or that dig is just one of many examples. Not all digressions are that bad, but all are all quite annoying because they take you away from the storyline. Fortunately, I got this as an e-book, so was able to skip over digression with a flick of a finger, while tracking the story line, which was quite revealing."
2,Heavy handed thesis ignores the majority of North American environmental history,"With his characterization of the entire American ecosystem as a garden carefully engineered and managed by Indians, Mann leaves out the environmental history of most of the North American continent. The dense forests of thousand year old redwoods and sitka spruce which greeted European immigrants in the Pacific Northwest were not products of American Indian slash and burn, or other agricultural management techniques. It seems that by ignoring the greater portion of North American environmental history during his narrative, it was easier for Mann to make his somewhat remedial, politically motivated point."
4,An interesting read,"An interesting book that describes new insights into life in the Americas before Columbus arrived. The book is well written and full of interesting theories and findings from academic literature. Though, at times it is a bit dense with information, so not exactly light reading. Still overall well worth reading."
4,An insightful book that recounts the accomplishments of the people who lived here before Columbus.,"The author carefully documents his examination of what was once called ""pre-history"" in the Western Hemisphere. Every facet of life here is described in good detail. I recommend this book to any pre-Columbian history buff."
4,"A ponderous, insightful read","I was facinated by this book early on and couldn't often put it down for three days before I polished of the last appendix. Mann has done an impossible/ yet convincing job of bringing the pre-columbian world alive -showing it through a lens that magnifies and brightens. All sorts of opposing views are treated with respect - letting the reader sort out the wheat and shaff given the evidences presented. I lapped it up!Occassionally the book bogged down into so much detail that it was distracting - I wanted to shout ""Get on with it!"" I think the points could have been made in half the space. Yet, Mann has walked a delicate balance between a pedestrian world of interested people and the myopic and stuborn world of the university/smithsonian know it alls. Bravo to C. Mann. He's a genius and he's fun to read."
4,"Interesting, easy read. Well, there were a few words I had never seen before but the Kindle dictionary solved that problem.",I kept thinking as I read that there was so much information I was not aware of regarding the Americas' native population. As soon as I got a little tired of the subject more interesting facts were introduced. This is a great read and worth the effort.
2,Droll and Boring,"If you'd like to learn the entire hierarchy of old native american and Latin american cultures than this is the book for you. Dispersed facts about each culture that could be interesting if tied together and actually filled the book make it worth perusing. However, the book is entirely too long and filled with drivel consistent with reading a list of kings for every country in Europe for the last 3,000 years. Information about each king would be written out and spoken as fact, though when the source behind the information is given you begin forming some serious doubts about the authenticity of it all."
2,book was destroyed.,"content is great! the company that sent it to me, however, did not mention that the book would come in two parts!! I was horribly dissapointed. I am however, a Social Studies Teacher and I use this book ALL the time in my discussion of Pre-conquest Americas."
1,"Misleading title, misleading subtitle","Caveat emptor. The first 1/3 of this book is about what happened to native populations in the Western Hemisphere AFTER the appearance of Europeans. It is not about the Americas before Columbus. Once again, focus on white conquerors and settlers, use the putative subjects as their foils. Mann writes very well, and the book is not dull; but it's not what it purports to be."
2,1491 Not Exactly what you may think !!!,"The book cover and audio book cover can be a little misleading. Some phrases the author uses are not in the average readers linguistic base. I thought this book would be a historical examination of America before Columbus came here. I failed to realize at the time that Columbus went to Cuba and the Dominican Republic. He didn't go to America. For us who are not well read in this era the references to ""The America's"" can be a little misleading.The book is a true scholars work. Lots of information. It is primarily about the Aztec and Incan Indians and their cultures. It does mention North American Indians but only a fraction of the book. Most of this book deals with the Indians in South America. If this is your area of interest then this book is for you! Otherwise it may not be exactly what you are looking for."
5,Great read,"This is one of the best books on the pre-Columbian Americas I've ever read. Unlike others it doesn't take sides and attempt to paint a rosy picture of noble savages living in perfect harmony with nature, murderous stone age barbarians in dire need of the benefits of civilzation, soap and Cristianity, or try to balance between these views. Rather it presents a detailed, factual and realistic picture of the people, social structures and land that were here before the Europeans and what became of them. I recommend it to anybody interested in the history of the Americas."
4,A change in perspective,"It's really hard to under estimate how different my perspective is on the Americas after reading ""1491"". Being an enthusiast of the Native American culture in the Desert Southwest, I was shocked to read the evidence for extensive advanced civilization throughout North and South America. Had I not read various articles in Scientific American and books such as ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"", I think I would have doubted most of what is in Mr. Mann's book.The book flows fairly well and is not too technical. I would guess it appeals mostly to people who like details and stories that dive far below the surface. The author does this well and introduces us to people on the way. The second half of the book engaged me much more, with the stories of specific characters in the whole story. The book kept me engaged and it was hard to put down."
5,1491,"Academic content but written well so it is understandable. The material covered is fascinating if you have a proclivity for archeology or anthropology and the earliest civilizations in the Americas. There have been many newly discovered facts, new to many of us because it is not like the textbooks in school lead us to believe. It contradicts much of the older conclusions drawn about the earliest peoples in the Americas. Bibliography is excellent."
5,1491,A well researched and well written history of the American Continent. It breaks through many of the myths and misconceptions that have framed the way Americans look at the environment. An important work that will be a remarkable tool as we continue into the 21st Century.
3,Stimulating but poorly documented and not edited.,"The publisher of the badly written, un-edited, and poorly documented ""1491"" by Charles Mann is Vintage Books. When did Vintage deteriorate to this degree? Mann jumps around all over the place without making connections, and is sometimes self-contradictory. He includes a 60-page Bibliography but does not link any statements in the text to specific references - the Bibliography is apparently just a catalogue of his personal reference library.After I finish this book I'll pick up ""1493"", but only if it's available at a deep discount - and will read it with a skeptical eye. I think the two books present some interesting material that is unfortunately undermined by shoddy workmanship.Suzanne Schettler"
3,powder dry,"This book has an excellent theme, but sometimes it is so dry I can't stand it. Not only does the book jump all over history back and forth (which makes it very confusing) but the narrator has a monotone voice."
1,Nothing is as neat in real life,This is great author but the aftertaste is that you never know where history stops and imagination begins. All fits a bit too neatly into the authors thesis. Nothing is as neat in real life.
4,"Good, but Columbian Exchange got there first","Thirty years ago, Alfred Crosby published The Columbian Exchange about the populations of both hemispheres, communication of diseases, and long term implications of the initial contact in this rich, readable, scholarly work. 1491 is a knock-off of the previous work, just as DaVinci Code lifted Holy Blood, Holy Grail. Everything old is new again--just give credit where credit is due."
3,Going back to stainless steel,"This pan is beautiful but not very functional. It's VERY heavy and difficult to lift without using two hands. The handle gets very hot, so make sure to use a pot holder. I would say that it's better suited for simmering/bubbly dishes that don't start with browning ingredients or searing. Tiny scratches in the enamel appeared the first time I used it (plastic utensils) and that's a huge disappointment! I bought the Rick Bayless grill/griddle also and that has worked wonderfully."
5,Very Scary!,"Probably one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, and with Angie Dickenson at her sexiest (check her out in the opening shower scene). I guessed who the killer was early-on, but I never knew when the scares were coming. Don't watch it alone!"
1,Where's my Mary Beth Hughes?,"I bought this thinking it was the 1941 b-movie by the same name starring Mary Beth Hughes and Lloyd Nolan (it was labeled as such). I was disappointed, to say the least. This movie's just kind of boring and I didn't get my Mary Beth Hughes eye candy fix. I know this isn't helpful,but some sellers on Amazon Marketplace seem to be getting these two movies mixed up, so be sure to ask the seller which version of Dressed to Kill they're selling before you buy!"
3,Name That Tune,"Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce star in their final film as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. This time, the duo is on the tracks of a gang stealing music boxes that mysteriously hold key information that will lead to much money. The music boxes are made in prison by a bank robber, who encodes the clues, but they are sold at an auction before his partners can buy them. There's nothing they won't do to get their hands on the boxes, including murder. There's not much new in this film that hasn't been seen in the other films of the series, although the music box angle is an interesting way of transferring information. Rathbone doesn't play this one with much energy ... maybe he was getting tired of the role, while Bruce is his usual, bumbling self. Although hardly the best in the series, fans of the duo will want to check it out."
2,A waste of paper...,"I have two books called sequels toLost Horizon (Hardback). The first one I have read wasMessenger: A Sequel to Lost Horizon: A Story of Shangri-La, a well crafted story which seemed to lack the spirit and warmth of the original but was still a delight to read. This sequel has the warmth and feel of the original but fails in a strong and interesting plot. It feels sloppy, misdirected, and aimless. It has no point and, therefore, fails to hold up to the greatness and lovingly crafted perfection of the first novel. I found myself getting bored and reading this book felt like I was stomping over a muddy field. And found more mud on the other side as my prize."
1,ShangriLa,"This is a truly horrible, boring, badly written book following 1/2 a century behind the original, which is one of my favorite novels. It is not worh reading. Read it 15 years ago, and gave it another try.It compares to the 2nd Lost Horizon movie, which was equally underwhelming.Bill Harris"
3,"Fun, but know what you're getting","I received this game as a Christmas gift as there isn't much golfing in Upstate NY in the winter. The product does a good job of enforcing good fundamentals, but takes a bit to get used to. The sensor is embedded in the control unit and is sensitive to ANY movement above or near it, which can result in added strokes. I would have hoped the graphics to be better as they were about Nintendo (Original, 1983) quality. The unit does not come with an AC adapter but has the receptacle for an aftermarket one, which I purchased at a local electrical store for an extra $15."
2,anti-edited,"Nice to have all the texts together in one place, but errors have been injected throughout. A footnote to Ihering, ""Geist des roemischen Rechts,"" becomes ""romsichen Recht""; a quote from Ronald Dworkin, with the note from Robert Cover ""emphasis in original,"" has the emphasis left out (it was the word ""meaning""). In other words, the editors have taken texts almost entirely available on Westlaw and had them retyped with many errors. Wait for the second edition, or at least don't touch the hardcover."
3,Meh,"I loved loved loved the reviews, and had high hopes. The nozzle is nicely made, solid, and looks like it is of very high quality. If you fiddle with the shaping screw you can perhaps achieve a good spray. I haven't found it yet :)"
1,Contains lead,"It should be made clear that this product contains lead. From the packaging:""NOTE: The brass in this product contains lead. WARNING: This product contains one or more chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling.""The packaging also states that this product is Made in China, not Made in USA as the product page describes."
4,A must for hard house fans,"Well I got this CD for Christmas and I am extremely pleased with it. I think CD 1 which is more hard house than trance is the better - mainly for Florian F's Surreal Brazil which is a masterpiece - But still I like the harder feel of this disc. Number 2 is definitely lighter and trancier but gets a bit harder towards the end although it is spoiled at the start by using too many tracks with vocals(I think a definite no-no in trance), but even so there are some gems like Moogwai's Viola. So overall if you like stompier hard house tunes, buy it and listen to CD 1. CD 2 has too many cheesy vocals for me, so if you want good trance, wait for the soon-to-be-released Binary Finary album instead."
5,Jules Rocks another Phat One,"This Album is LARGE and INCHARGE Another wonderful mix by one of the worlds finest DJ,S"
1,Huge disappointment,"I must admit that the reviews regarding this CD are highly unreliable. CD 1 is just terrible, mundane and boring tunes. CD 2 is a little bitter but almost each song is played for a mazximum of 2:30 minutes! SO you don't even get a chance to really hear the tune. I would definitely not recommend this CD for fellow DJs- not enough length per song."
5,Simply the Best!!,"I believe that this is Kenny Barron's best album. The back and forth between Barron and Tonihino Horta on the acoustic guitar plus the rest of the rythm section [Assumpcao bass, V.Lewis drums, M.Cinelu perc.]in a Brazillian style is so simple and melodic and quite relaxing."
4,Great intro...but don't read it by itself if you want to really understand this subject,"This book was a great introduction to the basics of mortgage-backed securities, exactly as the title professes. It is loaded with graphs and tables to help readers understand the quantitative sections.If you really want to understand this subject though, read Fabozzi and Modigliani's ""Mortgage and Mortgage-Backed Securities Markets"" as well as (or even in lieu of) this book. It dates back to the 80s, but together with this book you will have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, and you can easily understand recent developments."
1,Lies perpetuated by the logging industry,"This little booklet, sponsored by the logging industry, tries to be a response to The Lorax in every fashion: literary, visually, morally and all. And it fails. The prose presented by the protagonist, Truax, consists of lies and falsehoods that reveals an extreme lack of understanding of basic forest ecology. The message is clear and completely wrong on every count.So no, editorial description of this book, it is not ""...dedicated to perserving [sic] our forests and saving the trees."" (Might want to turn spell check on!). It is dedicated to convincing young kids that the environmentalists are in error about their claims and that the logging industry is actually a benevolent entity, saving the forests from themselves. 'Cause gosh, really, what did those forests do without humans managing them for millions of years?"
5,Love this Nylabone Toy,My Bulldog loves this toy. I can't find them at the Pet Stores any more. Nylabone chew toys have always been my first choice when I buy dog toys.
1,Not Durable at All,I got this toy (size large) to keep my 25lb corgi/sheltie foster dog busy in his crate post-neuter. 10 minutes in he was ripping chunks of rubber off like it was nothing. He is NOT an aggressive chewer by any means and actually uses a puppy kong because he's such a mild chewer. I figured something like this would be okay but not even close. I'm glad I found it on sale because if it'd cost me the full price I'd be really sad.If it didn't withstand the chewing of a very mild chewer who is less than 25lbs it shoudln't be given to any moderate or heavy chewers... MUCH to my dismay.
3,gone too quick,My dog (american bulldog) has chewed on these since he was a puppy. This one was down to a nub within 2 weeks. They typically last longer but this one did not. Very disappointing since I have to spend $20 each time and I can't find them locally.
3,Durable but.....,"This is a VERY durable product, I am the owner of two labs.... Unfortunately they are not very interested in it and only use it every once in awhile...they seem to like to chew on a surface that has more texture...If you are looking for something with durability this is great and you can always put a bit of peanut butter on it to get the dog interested we do that at times with our labs!"
4,Tent play,"Easy to set up. Big enough for several kids to play in. Does take up a lot of room. Just be careful with the rods when setting it up. We did get a tear. Overall, the kids have fun playing with it. It's a good play tent for several kids and older kids as well."
1,Amazon fails to enlighten,I wish I had known that this was written entirely in German before I ordered it.
2,THIS IS NOT IN 3-D - JUST THE NAME OF THE MOVIE IS 3-D,"I bought this because the Amazon info at the top indicates this is a 3D movie - they even indicate what glasses you'll need to view it. I was SO excited! BUT - THIS DVD IS NOT IN 3D!!! The 3D is the original title, which WAS originally released in 3D. However, only a UK version was released in 3D - this one IS NOT!!! If you're looking for a 3D movie, this isn't it."
2,Not As Good........,"This is my least favorite of all the Amityville Horror movies. I find this one boring at times and the acting not so great. Not as many scares and thrills that the first 2 have. The house is still cool! but overall, this part 3 fails to deliver the suspense, etc. that the first 2 deliver. Just disappointing though not terrible."
3,misleading,"you need to fix your Product Alert and your Product Details Format Amityville horror 3d is not in 3d is just the name, the listing is wrong! i still like to move but was sad to find out it was misleading and did not come in 3d."
1,"3-D, no I don't think so","Of the three movies, 3-D on DVD, that I bought recently, this has to be labeled the ""not really 3-D"" movie. It could not shine a light to the National Geographic "" Sea Monsters 3-D"". Pass this one up."
1,Ridiculously Bad Movie,"I can't believe they're selling this movie. (A friend let me borrow his copy.) Bad acting (sorry Meg Ryan, but you did get better!), bad directing, bad special effects, no plot, no sympathetic characters. I laughed at the dorky demon when he jumped out of the well and lunged at the screen. But don't get me wrong, don't even waste your time watching this movie to laugh at how bad it really is, because it's not even campy. Really, it's so bad I wrote my first review just to warn you. They should throw all the copies of this movie in the well with that clown for a demon."
2,3D effects leave a lot to be desired,Movie was fair. Not as good as the others. The 3D effects are few and weak.
3,3.5 stars. Not as bad as the second one,"Even though AMITYVILLE 3-D may not be great, it is a worthy sequel. It does have kind of a structured plot and the acting, directing and story are not bad. It should get a DVD transfer, though. The VHS copies are very grainy and the sound isn't that good. Overall, it's not a bad sequel and it's one of the best in the series."
1,"The ""Death"" of the Amityville movie","After the Horrid and sicking Second movie, Dino De Laurentiis bought the rights to the story and set about to work his magic on it. Mr. De Laurentiis had done ""STUNING"" things with his train wreck films ""King Kong"", ""Orca"", and later ""STUNNERS"" like ""Dune"" and ""King Kong Lives"" so who better to do a sequel than him.With nothing like a story or plot to get in the way, the scares come like free money..... almost never!!!after this the series set dormant for almost 6 years!!! Yes, it's that bad!!!!!"
3,best out the series,i first watched this on pay tv back about 16 years ago.liked it then liked it now.i mean its not the best movie in the world.still it is better then some from the 80s.good effects and a good cast make it a good movie.far better then the rest of the series that goes on and on and they will stink.
1,so bad its almost comical,"This movie is absolutely dreadful - save your money and DO NOT buy it. It seriously has to be one of the worst , most cheesiest scary movies I have ever seen ( although I did not watch all of it because I had to turn it off after the first 30 minutes )"
2,OH NO,"I WISH THEY WOULD INCLUDE IN THEIR DESCRIPTION , IT IS NOT MADE FOR SHUTTER GLASSES 3D. I KEEP WASTING MY MONEY BECAUSE THEY WON'T DESCRIBE THE 3D'S ACCURATE."
1,Amityville 3(3D),"My beef isn't with it not being ""3D"" but with how boring and awful it is,the only spooks you get is scattered, You got this guy who is a ""Skeptic"" well needless to say so much for him being a skeptic and gets what he deserves for being so dumb,naive and stubborn or ""skeptic"". (In the movie of course), Lori Loughlin(Full House), An ever Annoying as Always Meg Ryan(Why couldn't she die in the movie?) and apparently a hot well/fountain in the basement. You want scares Try part 1 with Uber-Liberal Pansy and Stressiand Bum James Brolin and Part 2 With Burt Young(Convoy,Pig Pen) all the other movies after really are a disservice."
2,Nowhere near as good as the UK version.,"There was a version released in the UK and it includes an excellent 3-D DVD extra disc, you need the right TV to play it but it looks fanatastic. Go for that one instead."
1,Hated it!,The 3D I was looking for was crappy! I would not recommend this movie to anyone. 4 more words required!
5,Great read,"The memoir keeps you interested and anxious to hear about the next chapter in the characters life. I kept hoping for a ""happy ending""."
5,A Sad and Bravely Told Story,"I will not summarize this book as others have done it so beautifully before me. Suffice it to say, this book broke my heart and I was unable to even write a review for several days after finishing it as I was mulling it over in my mind. Julia Scheeres told her story without anger or bitterness which, to me, is astonishing and it appears that she still has a relationship with her family after all that they did to her and her adopted brothers. I believe, as another reviewer does, that Escuela Caribe reform school should be investigated then closed so that other children are not subjected to abuse at the hands of these people. I am happy to see that Julia emerged from this horrifying childhood with her mental faculties intact and has done so much with her life. The book is a tribute to her love for her adopted brother, David, which is what ultimately kept her alive and sane. I highly recommend this book and will recommend it to my reading group."
5,Secrets that Must be Revealed,"Julia Scheeres has tremendous courage. She tells the story of a dysfunctional Christian family where image is everything, and love is basically absent. The parents use religion and morality as a ""mental wall"" to keep themselves from healing and learning lessons. This is a telling indictment on religion in America today. Faith should enlighten and guide individuals, especially parents, to learn new and often difficult lessons. Instead, faith was used by Scheeres' parents to stubbornly deny the truth of what was going on in their family: sexual abuse, child abuse and racism."
3,I liked the honesty of this story,"I understand that this is a Memoir but at points it was pretty sexually graphic. I could not allow my kids to read this book. I found it to be a really sad story. It is amazing to me what people are forced to live through and if you want to read a true to life story, it is well written."
4,"Oh, so sad","This was one of those books that you just can't put down. I found Julia Scheeres memoir of her life disturbing and depressing but also truly engrossing. I felt awful for Julia and her brother David and the way that their parents treated them. I hated her parents and their hypocritical existence. I was frightened by Julia's account of life at their reform school in the Dominican Republic and I just kept hoping that something would change for them. This book really stayed with me for a long time after reading it.After reading what I've written I realized that I make it sound like an awful book and I certainly don't mean to, it was a very good memoir, very well written and like I said before engrossing but also touching and very sad."
4,Beautiful tribute to sibling love,"I found Jesus Land to be at times heartwrenching, at times inspiring, but at times, a tad dull. Scheeres blow-by-blow ""this happened, then this happened"" narrative style lacked the emotional draw necessary to match the scenes she was describing.I've lived in Lafayette for 10+ years, and we certainly have our share of fundamentalist Christians and other bigots. There is evidence of intolerance not only toward African-Americans, but to Jews, gays and others, too. But, like any community, we are not all like that. I hope that this book (and it's recency of events!) might open the eyes of those who believe discrimination is dead and encourage us all to start new dialogue about racism, intolerance and sexual abuse (just to name a few). Together, we can make our community grow stronger."
2,Not very well written,"I read the entire book in three hours. This book seemed to have too much fluff added to it to make it worth reading. She seemed to say the same thing over and over. I pretty much skipped 3 of the end chapters. I'm guessing the last 5 or 6 chapters have deal with her time at Escuala Caribe. Unfortunately, the are all pretty much the same thing. Mental abuse, physical punishments, etc. Ok we got the point after the first two chapters at the school. They were abusive and you wanted out.This book definitely made you hate her parents. In the acknowledgement she talks about her sisters, but she never mentions what happened to her parents or her other brothers. All in all it had interesting parts, but was definitely not one of those books that you just can't put down."
2,Cold and emotionless writing,"I am halfway through this book and I'm not sure if I plan on finishing it. Two stars to the author for writing the book and releasing the painful memories, but I just can't get past her cold and emotionless writing style.Edited to say: Ok, I finished it and my initial comments stand true. The author seemed too detached from the actual events."
5,Beautiful but dark memior,"This is a beautifly written memoir of youth and adolescence in a strict fundamentalist household in the midwest and a reform school in the Dominican Republic. It exposes the dark underbelly of christian fundamentalists, and also the dark underbelly of being a teenager in the modern world. I enjoyed the book very much, but be warned, it's very dark."
5,totally awesome christian album! i love deeper and sanctify,A great mix...nice balance between good music and good message...very simple and powerful in style.
5,King of Fools,King of Fools is a classic album - it is the best done by Delerious and although they have released 2 albums since it they still play the majority of the songs from this album. Although this album contains a lot of christian lyrics it is still very accessable to anyone who is not into christianinty as the music is just plain brilliant. All the Way is a class song and I reccomend anyone to buy the album.
3,Very good message...redundant music,"In depth lyrics, nifty and original title...same music throughout. In some instances, I can't tell which song is which, because most of them sound THE SAME. If you liked this, try dcTalk for some better music, more originality within albums, and better....everything. -Sorry to wreck the 5 star train"
3,"Great message, BUT...","Don't get me wrong - I LOVE Christian rock. In fact, my very first introduction to the genre was a 2 disk set from Delirious. Since then, however, I've also been introduced to Audio Adrenaline, Third Day and DC Talk - among others. While this particular CD is masterfully mixed and the guys are all masters of their instruments, it just lacks the driving force behind the message I've come to appreciate from others. (I often tease my wife - who tends towards the more mellow in music - that she needs to start a support group called, ""Headbangers for Christ."")This is a decent album, (dating myself there), and the rhythmic backdrop of ""August 30th"" - while initially annoying to me - became strangely soothing and reassuring by the end. There is plenty of good to be said about this disc, but if you tend towards Third Day and AA, this one probably isn't for you."
5,Kicking for God Totally cool,Deleriuos is so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It makes me want to jump up and down like a mad man. I love it. I think that it is totally cool how God is using them to tell hundreds about Jesus. *****
4,A COLLECTION OF FINE POP SONGS,"This is the best Stranglers release. The songs are infectious and direct. This is what a pop album should be. Standout cuts like always the sun, was it you? , ghost train and nice in nice are all great tunes."
3,Always the sun,"I've purchased it only due to that song. And yes I love it. I didn't listen the rest of the LP with attention yet, but doesn't sound bad."
1,Shine,"I bought ""Shine"" and found that the sound was inaudibly small with maximum volume control. So I complained and got a new copy which turned out to be the same.For this dvd of a story of a mentally unstable genius pianist the sound is the most crucial but it failed.I advise you that you should have checked the quality of sound before you put on this item for sale."
2,SHINE,"Did not watch all of it...Very poor sound-mix qualityStory-line was abusive, which I do not care forI give all of my DVDs to the local library once I am done with them"
4,"Disturbing, but is that a good or bad thing?","I enjoyed this movie for the most part. After all, it was well-acted, had beautiful music, had an uplifting, inspring ending, what's not to like, right? Well, fact is, it's been a while since I saw it, and frankly I can't remember the music, or even much of the story; so, what's left, you ask? Vivid recollections of the disturbing behavior of the characters, and a feeling of unease, and wanting to avoid watching it again. Too bad, but maybe I'll just get some of artist's music instead."
1,Shine - Terrible packaging,"This DVD has TERRIBLE packaging. Once you have opened the DVD case by breaking the plastic seal, it will never close properly again. I didn't do anything wrong - you're supposed to break the plastic seals - but it's just terrible!Scroll down to the 'Snapper' type case:http://www.andreas-lenz.de/dvd/casetypes/index.php"
5,One of the best movies I've ever seen!,So uplifting! Wonderful to see someone defy the odds. And wonderful to see the good side of human nature as well as the bad.
5,Great Movie,"Very dark and different kind of TRUE story, great cast as well, it keeps your interest all the way through.The ending is very uplifting, had a great time watching it, can't wait to see it again!"
5,Great tale of genius,Emotional story of a imperious father' devastting effect on a sensitive musical genius.
5,Amazing!,"While this movie does lose a little of its visual sweep on the small screen, the story, acting, and emotions all come through. Rush deservedly won to Oscar for his on target perfromance of pianist David Helftgott. If you have not seen this move wait no longer, and if you ever get the chance to see it on the big screnn DO!"
1,Not my kind of movie.,"Too slow, not much going on. I couldn't even finish it. There was no character study, no plot that I could see, nothing. I kept waiting for something to happen or for something to mean something or to see if there was any direction in it. Maybe it was just me, but I don't get it."
2,terrible buy,"the dvd did not play on a dvd player. It had a restriction on the ability to play. it really SUCKED,"
5,Most Interesting & Informative,If you have any intrest in knowing what life is like in Israel this book will satify your intrest. I found it very well written easy to read and the author gave intelligent insight and positions of all groups written about. Upon finishing this book I had a useful and fulfilling knowledge of Israelis and Israel. Of course this is only a glimpse but the book shows one there is such rich history and fascinating people in this diverse land. It gave some insight to both views mentioned in the editorial review. However I took from the book Israel is making attempts at assisting ALL Israelis no matter their ethnic origins. You will not regret adding this book to your Library.
3,NOT THE USUAL -,THIS AUTHOR DID A GOOD JOB WITH WHAT SHE WAS COVERING. PEOPLE LIVING UNDER DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE A DIFFERENT ATTITUDE THAN THOSE WHO ARE NOT. IT WAS INTERESTING.
1,Tales of Alhambra.,"Multiple pages missing ie, blank.Had taken this book on vacation to Spain and was disappointed as I could not completely read few stories The pages were blank.Fist bad experience of a purchase from Amazon."
3,Rather Dated!,"I purchased this audio book in anticipation of my trip to Spain in October. It is a rather dated performance. I just have ""read"" The Constant Princess. That presentation was lively and beautifully done. This is a chore to listen to. Sorry."
4,kindle book,We are going on a tour to alhambra on our Transatlantic Cruise in April and my wife wanted to read about Alhambra before we left. She has not finished the book but said if is very interesting
4,Equal to 'Panzer General' or 'Advance Wars',"No resource gathering in this game !You start with an army and capture train station, factories, airports, which you can then use against the enemy!A pc/dos classic."
5,"The Good Soldier Schweik, an Overlooked Classic","Many years ago, after reading ""The Good Soldier Schweik,"" I named my dog ""Schweik,"" in honor of the hero of the book. Schweik, a mixed Lab, lived to age 14. To read a new edition of the book brought many memories, both in the book and living with my dog, who actually acted a little bit like the good soldier (Did not follow commands very well). A classic book for sure, which still needs more exposure in the United States."
4,Best price for this poster/quick shipping,"I ordered this for my husbands weight room, and it is exactlly what I wanted, it is the best price on the internet, but if i were to order again, I would get the cover and stuff to hang it since I got it almost a month ago, and haven't put it up because it comes in a tube so I will need to get something to put it up. (but that was my choice to leave that off the order)It also takes awhile to ship, maybe because I am a prime member, I'm used to prompt shipping, but even still, it seemed to take a bit long to get.Overall great poster, and anyone who snowboards will love it!"
2,not dinah,"I bought this CD because I love Dinah Washington. Most of the CD is wonderful. But two of the cuts don't have Dinah singing at all. They are fine tunes, I suppose, but they are not what I thought I was purchasing. I wanted Dinah Washington, not some other musicians jamming. I feel I was mislead, and ripped off."
5,Durable,"We'd bought a different tent that the kids tore through in a matter of minutes and we returned. Did a little more research the second time around and decided on this one. They've played just as hard with this one now for several weeks and it is holding up great. Easy to assemble and the hardware is much more stable than the first one we had. Got the tunnel that matches - also durable and the kids love running into the tent, thru the tunnel and back again - over and over and over."
2,Support rod broke,"Support rod broke through in no more than 4 months of light use by our 3 year old, and by light use I mean mostly sleeping in it. The rods are jointed together and one of them bent and broke making the tent lopsided. Not too happy with the quality."
4,Great fun for little ones,"We bought this tent for our son (age 20 months) for Christmas. He loves it. It is so much fun for him to hide from Mommy and Daddy in his tent. It is quite durable - he climbs in and out and regularly crashes into it on his ride around cars. It's held up to all of this with no problem. We have this setup in his play area - when not in use - it's a great place to store toys, books and other small items that might look messy if let in plain view. I would recommend this product - for the price, you can't beat the value."
4,Just the right size for inside,"My five year old and I too have enjoyed this item. It seems of equal price and quality. The size of it is attractive. It does not take up the whole room when set up. It's large enough for play but, not too big to walk by. The storage is great. It has a small bag with a slot to add a name tag for storing."
1,BLUE POWDER-LIKE DUST PARTICLES,"My kids absolutely love this toy, however, I have noticed a lot of fine bright blue powder-like particles when I am sweeping our wood floors. Being a nurse, I am very concerned that if I'm finding this 'dust' two and three rooms over from where the tent is set up, that my kids are actually inhaling it into their lungs in addition to tracking it all over the house via their socks. Thusfar no one has mentioned any strange blue streaks in their Kleenexes when they sneeze etc but since 2 of my kids have had problems with bronchospasms and wheezing in the past I am taking this tent down until I hear from the manufacturer as to what is going on. Has anyone else noticed this problem?"
1,Aweful,"I do not recommend this tent. It smells like the costumes from halloween in the 80's, it's HUGE and not well made."
2,Not very durable,Works fine for kids who are more reserved. It was fun for them to hide in and play. But it does not withstand being moved often and kids who ruff house. The poles will push through the corner holders by being moves frequently. I reinforced them to prolong use. But when my daughter fell on the tent one of the poles snapped and it was game over. It lasted 2 months.
4,Great tent!,"This tent is really a good one. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the top is see-through (a sheer mesh) and in order to make it dark inside I have to cover it with a dark quilt... one of the reasons I bought it was so that I didn't have to use a quilt to make a tent for my daughter! Wish it came with a cover of some sort.I also put four 2'x2' foam square mats inside to soften the inside bottom and they fit perfectly!My kids love to play in it. It doesn't take up too much room. Right now it's in my dining room but it's going in the playroom we are making for the girls. (The two little girls in the pictures, with their cousin, are mine.) Right now they are the right size for it but when they get older I might buy them the bigger version.And I don't see any blue dust anywhere in my house so maybe the nurse who complained about it should write to the company and get a new one."
5,Really great tent...doubles as ball pitt !!!!!,"I recently purchased a Hot Wheels tent that looked just like this but it had no bottom and the balls just rolled out underneath all 4 sides. I purchased this and it works wonderful for my 3 1/2 yr old and 2 year old as a ball pitt. I just keep the velcro side closed and they crawl in and out of the round hole. Then they can use as tent as well. Wonderful, easy to put up. No tools, no man needed !!! HA-HA !! Everyone with young kids should have one of these with balls in it."
4,One yearold loves it!,"We purchased this tent for our son's first birthday. It is small enough to set up in the house without taking up too much space. The colors are great and it has lasted through our son hanging on the walls. We have not let him touch the zippers, they seem a little flimsy."
1,Latest stupid kitchen idea,"Stains by looking at it. Seriously, as granite is porous, it absorbs stains and they seem to have made this white granite especially susceptible to acquiring stains. Pour out a cup of old coffee into the sink even with the water running and it stains. There is no way to avoid staining it. Its a constant pain, chore and regret."
1,Do not buy this sink,"I bought this sink from a major home improvement store 2 years ago, and I wish there had been warnings online before I did. One reviewer said it stains when you simply look at it, and that is no exaggeration. It must be a highly reactive material; even a bread crumb will stain it. I scour it multiple times a day, and I find I'm reluctant to even wash my hands in it after I've scrubbed it because even that will leave a stain which must be scoured out again. I plan to replace it with stainless steel, even though I love the look of white."
1,Awful sink,"I too inherited this sink when we bought a house. It's amazing how something as simple as a sink can be so totally irritating. I can keep the stains out but only using multiple products several times a day. If I rinse out a soup can and turn it upside down in the sink to drain I get rust stains that must be removed with a rust product (I use Whink). . . bleach won't do it. But, I need bleach to get out the other stains like coffee and juice. I need cleaser like Comet or Ajax to get rid of the black scrape marks the pots and pans leave. I would never ever recommend this sink to anyone. I hate it and am researching new sinks to replace this one."
5,Beautiful Black sink!!!,"We have the sink in Galaxy Black and we love it!!! No stains for us and the little scuff marks that happen come right out! I suppose you need a darker colored counter-top to work well with the dark sink, and we do, but I think the contrast with a lighter colored counter-top may work well also."
5,Immensely Helpful Resource,"I remember reading Jim's great book when I started off in fundraising. I thought: precise writing and an excellent explanation of the basic truths of raising money. It was, and is, an immensely helpful resource. It has helped me to raise a lot money for great causes over the years. But more importantly, it has helped tens of thousands of people to raise billions to improve lives and our world.Harvey McKinnonLeading consultant, author, and teacher"
5,The psychology of fund raising made simple.,Most fund raising literature seems to suggest systems and ways to avoid asking for a financial commitment from donor prospects. Lord reminds us of the simple basics necessary to develop our own philosophy of philanthropy and the psychology of fund raising needed to garner financial resources for your organization.
1,Motorola SLVR L6i Unlocked International,"The phone description says it is a quad band phone, but the one I received was tri-band (900/1800/1900). This international version does not work everywhere I need it to work. I have AT&T service (3G) and it works in NYC, where I work, but it did not work in upstate NY. The network in upstate NY switches from 3G to EDGE. If it had 850 band, it would have worked. The phone itself is a decent phone, but if doesn't work, it doesn't matter. Amazon's description is not accurate, so if you need a quad band phone beware of this phone. You might be better off getting a US version instead."
1,Chinese phone,"The keyboard, and the default language is chinese. After spending a long time, I was able to find out how to change the language to English. But still it would store ""names"" in the address book in Chinese language only. They should have warned the customers about this issue. Will try to return the phone !"
3,It's fine,"I had no trouble when installing my SIM card and generally it works fine, but I've had problems at times with it refusing to turn on. After removing and reinserting the battery it worked ok. I'm not thrilled with the tiny number buttons and the backlight doesn't stay on long enough during certain procedures. I would not buy this type of phone again."
3,a few things before buying this phone ...,"the first thing you need to know is that this phone is completely made it to be used in china. The phone offer some options that are made it just to be used with a ""china phone service"" (to name it in some way)Once you find where you can change the language to english, you will seethat the phone works great, it does what it need to do, camera, bluetooth, radio, 10Mb of capacity, and is a good looking phone.In my country (Costa Rica), the phone worked perfectly ... i could make calls, send messages and do everything your SIM card allow you to doit doesnt come with earphones ... just the phone and the charger ... and a lots of chinese manuals and one manual in englishDont expect a cheap camera ... expect a super bad camera ...so you got it, this is the phone you are looking if you want a cheap one .. i just hope you could find where to change to language faster than me"
3,It's ok,"This isn't the best phone in the world but it will do. It has a lot of problems with reception; I have a contract with ATT and broke my phone, this phone was a replacement for the old one. The problem, however, is that this phone does not get reception where my old phone used to. Plus the reception fades in and out."
2,CHinese phone!!!,The phone I received turned out to be a China Mobile one with all connections to Chnese provider and Chinese-type keyboard layout! I feel I should have been warned it is the model for CHinese market!
5,New Love in Tokyo Very entertaining,"Make no mistake this is a movie about s/m. But it's very entertaining, and believable. There are a couple of pretty graphic scenes and some piercings that may turn a few people off. Also there are a few areas where the movie gets a bit slow (her acting job) but on the whole I enjoyed the movie and I think you will to."
2,Bad Publication of a Good Story,"This copy of the story is very poorly published (my version is from Hard Press). One example - there is a TOC (table of contents) with about 67 chapters listed (a recollection, as I have already returned my book). The chapter titles in the TOC do not correspond with the titles at the beginning of the chapters, but to a description of each chapter. All of the chapters listed in the TOC are not in the book, there are only about 44 in the book, only the first part of The Story of Mankind. I sent mine back and will look for a different edition."
1,Partisan update,"Van Loon's book has been a staple of family reading hour for decades, and more recently it has received renewed circulation among homeschooling families. Originally written in 1921, this story of civilization has been continuously updated, not always profitably. What's below is an excerpt from the current edition:""The civil rights movement escaped another defeat when the Reagan administration's attempt to grant tax exemptions to schools that discriminate against blacks failed. The economic future of young blacks remained bleak, as they continued to suffer the highest unemployment rate in the United States, while the government reduced many of the welfare programs that had helped the poor subsist.""Readers seeking a less partisan history are advised to find an older edition or to obtain E.H. Gombrich's excellentA Little History of the World, recently released by Yale University Press in an English edition."
2,A bit much?,"While I appreciate the daunting task of putting all that history into one volume, you'll find this book to be like the old adage more ""His story"" than history. The writer's personal value system shines through the book as he interprets his view of history. One interesting rant about his major premonition about the Roman Empire and how it was defeated by a child in Bethlehem. Other than a giving us a few vague moral lessons, Van Loon gave us no insight of what Jesus Christ did that was so revolutionary to topple the largest superpower ever. Could you give us a bit of depth? I don't get it."
1,Offensive But Possibly Usefull.,"If you are a Jew, Islamist Christian or just somebody that appreciates accurate history and science, than this book will be offensive to you. I encourage you to read it for yourself to see what I mean, but you will not want your children to read it.Depending on the maturity of your children, this book could be used as a tool to teach your children correctly. Here's how: get a pencil and draw a line through every sentence you disagree with. Tell you child why you have done this and let them read it. After each chapter go through the marked parts and tell them what you believe to be the truth."
5,Should be required reading for young adults.,"I first read this book in High School. It sparked an interest in history in me that has burned bright ever since. It, by itself, almost caused me to become a history major in college. Van Loon's style and presentation was the key. Instead of a dry recitation of dates and people, Van Loon puts you on the scene, you can smell the campfires, the thoughts the common folk might have had as they participated in the events, great and not so great, of our roots. As a sublime introduction to history for the young adult, a perfect follow-up for the adult reader is the ""Outline of History"" by H.G. Wells. I would put both books as required reading at some point in a humans life.BK"
4,Historical Document,"When I was a kid my father read this book to me (almost 40 years ago). Some of the stories told in this book have been updated with recent research, that is why this book has to be read as a historical document, not as a history book."
2,Little disappointing,"Maybe because it was written for his children, and although it provides good summarized historic events, I found the author to be too opinionated on such matters that should be historically evidenced..."
2,There are no illustrations,I was very disappointed when I realized that this version does not contain the illustrations or maps. I had planned on my fifth grader using this for history.
2,The Story Of Mankind,"The first 100 pages of this book are entertaining. He writes in a way that keeps you interested up to a point. I am an avid reader and this book took me many months to finish. I didn't even want to finish it but always feel compelled to do so. History repeats itself and after so many chapters of war I just didn't care anymore. After reading this book I felt that desiring peace in a time of war is hardly possible. Looking back over our history made this clear-humans, power, and violence go hand in hand."
3,These run very small,"These shorts run ridiculously small. I triple checked the size on the tags and on the interior because I was so sure I was sent the wrong pair. Since these are so much smaller than I expected, I would definitely recommend trying these on in a store to determine size. Plus, I didn't know until too late that the seller gouges the price for shipping, in both directions, which is going to make returning them a really expensive hassle. So, be sure to review all the necessary details of the shipping policy and rates before purchasing."
3,Good but....,"The author is a down to earth person. There are many good points in this book, especially about release. Everything she writes about release is true. It was worth buying the book for those pages. I learned things I did not know before. I did think there was some unnecessary fluff in the book and I did not leave this book feeling elated or healed. In the last few months, I also read ""Releasing a Toxic Person"" and found that book to be more soothing of a book, especially at times in my life when I am hurt. Overall this book is worth reading, it's good and the author is insightful."
5,THE Textbook for Breakups Look no further.,"This is THE information that will help you recover from a breakup in record time. It has helped me and all of my friends when love hasn't worked out. We pass it back and forth all the time, and I've had to buy a new one a few times when someone refused to give it back LOL!"
4,Very helpful,"I've listened to this once and done the release exercise / meditation twice, and I already feel infinitely better than i did even yesterday. It's not an instant process by any means, I think I will need to re-do it several times at least before I am fully free of my attachment. However, the comfort this program gave me at a time when I really needed it alone makes it well worth the money for me, regardless of whether or not the releasing part works. So far so good, though."
3,"narrow scope, choppy acting, but worth 1 watch","This 1964 movie was worth one box of low-fat Cheese-nips. I figured I had it figured out, just by Jack Hawkins getting second-billing. Ok, they outsmarted me on that.I have three problems with this supposedly ""intelligent"" who-done-it.1) The viewer is presumed to CARE about these characters of whom we only get thin, almost cliche, snippets of their reportedly shocking lives, and way too many loose ends remain at the end.2) Too many scenes are shrill, and then we are supposed to just move on.3) Although I never did like the 40s-50s movies with guys whose ""character"" is established simply by ""don't mess with me, I'm wearing a hat,"" many movies of the 60s replaced that with ""I am more successful than you, because I wear a buttoned-up suit all movie long."" The biggest shock of the movie was that Stephen Boyd wasn't in a suit in the hospital bed.Anyway, catch this one on TMC or borrow it from a friend."
2,Extremely Weak Psychological Thriller,"I'm surprised to see that other people actually enjoyed this film, since I would rank it as perhaps the worst psychological thriller I have ever seen. A turgid script, weak lead performances, and lackluster direction make for a tedious experience. The DVD transfer is acceptable, though the contrast is rather excessive (perhaps a recently struck print was the source). With so many fine films unreleased on DVD, it is rather a mystery why this entirely lackluster effort has been released."
5,Permatex valve grinding compound,"Recieved the Permatex valve grinding paste. Noticed it was extremely gritty, not at all what I was expecting. But it worked like a champ, ground those valves perfectly - no more leaking valves. Just keep this paste out of the valve guides!"
5,Top of His Craft,"Ramsey Lewis' Time Flies simply shows that Ramsey is still at the top of his game. The fresh version of The In Crowd is scintillating and the rendition of Hosanna is R& B gospel at its best. The eclectic mixture of classical( Poco Allegretto from Brahms third symphony ), jazz, a dash of rock and a little blues all work for one of the best collections that I have heard in years. There isn't a second rate piece on the CD; and, nothing in this collection would ever be considered a ""filler"". This CD jams."
3,Wonderful arrangements and musicianship,"The sound on this CD is beautiful, and the performances are excellent, with something for everybody. The additional musicians enhance the sound without overpowering the music. However, every recording has its bad moments, and I would have given this recording five stars save for the annoyingly pretentious acapella solo vocal kickoff to ""Wade in the Water"". This few seconds is justification enough to knock off a star or two. The classical numbers are tastefully done, and the new version of ""In Crowd"" moves along nicely. Worth buying, but program your player to skip ""Wade in the Water."""
5,the best ramsey lewis album!,"i have 4 ramsey lewis' album and this is by far the best one i've heard... in this album ramsey uses the cello in some of the most emotionally involving tracks particularly Second Thoughts and Air From Suite #3... i first got wind of this album from a friend who loaded it in my ipod...after listening to the whole album a couple of times, i immediately bought the CD... i enjoy the music much more now because it's in WAV format instead of MP3, and i'm playing it on my hi-fi audio system!"
1,Review,"First of all, the title is Time Flies no Files.Secondly, I had ordered several new and used from you and had sent them to alot of our friends. Unfortunately, One of those cd/s was blank!I was so embarrassed. What can be done about this?"
2,what can I say? (1.5-2 stars),"don't know what to pronounce this. Seem to me that the 2nd single ""Play"" (off from David Banner's CERTIFIED) has been overrated to me IMO. I try to like that song, but it's been a lil' off the guard or way too quick, I mean the beats are ok, the lyrics are aight and stuff, but it needs alot of pulling, alot of action, maybe a lil remix too add. No hard feelings but not my type'a song, not on my list yet."
2,It works but...,It fit extremely loose. It does not sit straight off the back of my truck it fits a little off to the right which I think is very strange. My other bike rack was straight but I use that on my camper trailer. All I can say is that it works for the price. You get what you pay for.
5,Great Book,"Meticulous examination of the Christian religion and it's bible. It takes apart the bible piece by piece and leaves it in shreds. Anybody who isn' afraid to exercise the mind should read this book. And by the way to the guy who had that quote from Ben FRanklin condemning Paine's work, Ben Franklin died in 1790 but Paine wrote The Age of Reason years later so that quote you have is an absolute lie."
3,Worth reading,"Here is Paine's famous book-by-book attack on The Bible's authenticity and (to a lesser extent) case for Deism. It is informative and readable, well presented and (mostly) well reasoned.There are perhaps a half dozen or so times where his vitriol overtakes his reason, and the heat of his hatred for Christianity becomes rather tiresome, but other than that, I think his criticism holds much water.As to the science, I think that outside of a few times where he strays past the limits of the history and archaeology of his day this book holds up surprisingly well today.I would like to have seen more positive arguments for Deism as opposed to negative arguments against Judaism and Christianity (and Islam to a much lesser extent) but I think, probably, he was writing to an already Deist audience."
5,Free-Thought,"This is the exact reason why I must say that I'm proud to be an american, this literary classic totally de-bunks what is ""expressed"" in what we call the 'holy' bible. Thomas Paine had the courage to write this essay at A time when he most likely would've been imprisoned or executed for heresy. Thomas Paine, the man responsible for entitling this great country of ours the ""United States Of America"", he is A great american hero."
3,300 year old review,It is amazing that 300 years have gone by and I would give the bible a review very similar to Paine but would use different selection of words and all of them negating the authenticity.
5,Good Products,All aspects of this transaction met or exceeded my expectations and the product is or performs as it is represented
3,eye opener,"While this treatise is rather difficult to read, it is a eyeopener about the time of the mid to late 1700's. I can understand why Thomas Payne was a radical."
4,Wonderful book,"It discusses his beliefs in which he thinks the New and Old Testament are not true because it is from here say, which is the word of man and not the Word of God. He wonders how people can believe something written in a text and not something that was personally told to them. His biggest argument was how we can believe in something we have never seen. This is a good book to read because it explains many beliefs and misunderstandings that you may have about the bible and of various religions."
1,"Too much hype, not enough meat...","I was challenged to read this by a friend and thought it would bring up some intersting questions to debate. I was hugely disappointed with the quality of Paine's arguments. It was written before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls and without the benefit of modern scholarship, so the arguments are antiquated. It is more of a rant than a scholarly essay on reason. It's probably something people should read simply because Paine is so well-respected, but I recommend something by William Lane Craig instead."
5,"Great Voice, Great Songs, Great CD !","Patti LuPone signs Irving Berlin's songs as they were meant to be sung. From ""Heat Wave"" to ""Count your blessings instead of Sheep"" she is in great voice and it is a wonderful album from beginning to end.She is greatly supported by John Mauceri and the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. John Mauceri and Patti LuPone revive these songs in great arrangements.Add this to your collection. You won't regret it."
3,"uh, not all that.","I'd been told how great this movie was, and once I saw it, I didn't much like it. There are a few hair-raising moments and a few laughs, but the American actors are SO bad and the plot is SO lame. I love fight scenes, but a movie's got to have more to get the thumbs up in my book! Jet looks cute as always, but this isn't his best film by a LONG LONG shot."
3,Try to rent if possible,"For real Jet Li fans this movie is ok, but was not really his style, of course Jet has to do some awesome fighting and was well worth watching. The movie overall was a little too long and really was one that you'll be happy that you saw him fight. Like I said rent if possible."
2,A Failure on all levels,"I had a lot of hope for this film. As a huge fan of the first two films in this series, I was excited to see the return of Jet Li to the role that made him famous. Also, I had hopes that Sammo Hung behind the camera could only improve things...I was wrong. The story is uninspired, a mix between that Star Trek episode where Kirk loses his memory and ends up living with Native Americans and...well, bad westerns. The fight scenes, which are supposed to be the hallmark of any HK actioner, were weak and shot poorly, missing whatever art may have been there. If you are interested in the genre, avoid this picture and rent/buy the first two. You want Cowboys and Indians with martial arts...well, watch old ""Kung Fu"" episodes, if you must."
2,Disappointing chapter in a great series - thanks Sammo,"The biggest flaw in this flick is it's director, Sammo ""I'll do anything to make you laugh"" Hung.Leave it to Sammo to do a great job of disrespecting a great Chinese folkhero by making him look incompetent and stupid. While the fight scenes were descent, I could not get over the fact that all credibility of the character had been destroyed. Sammo just didn't do this whole saga justice.On a side note, the DVD version that I saw (and reviewing), the ChinaStar version, had about a 2-3 second delay in subtitles. Also the aspect ratio manually changes. Not a very professional job.I would rent this first. If you decide to purchase it, make sure it's the Carnival version, as pictured at the top of the page."
2,"Good try, but no cigar!","When Jet Li stars as legendary Wong Fei-Hong, you know you're going to see lightning quick attacks and ferocious high flying exploits. The only problem is that in all the Wong Fei-Hong movies combined, Fei-Hong has almost never been hit during the fight scenes. Every adversary prior to this movie seemed relatively skilled. But in this one none of these guys stood a chance! None of them had any skill at all! If you just wanted to watch fight scenes, you'll be sorely disappointed to watch Jet beat up a bunch of Americans. I suppose they were trying to focus more on the story line (which was dreadfully mediocre!). The previous Once Upon a Time in China movies are much better. If you can't get enough of Wong Fei-Hong movies, try Iron Monkey! It's a much more exciting movie."
3,Mostly ok,"It was mostly what I expected. My subtitles didn't work right and kept displaying several seconds after they were talking. It may have colored the way I saw the movie, though."
1,50 Fast and Bad Techniques,"This book doesn't give much explanations and for a reason: it looks like the author is not profficient in what he tries to teach. Some of his advices are dead wrong, for example converting color to b&w: his method gives far inferior results to proper techniques (there are more than one). The method he suggests is definitely the fastest - probably for this very reason almost every book or Web Tutorial (there are dozens of them) will tell you why you should avoid this method. I returned the book and won't recomend it to anyone, beginner or intermidiate. Check other books, like Scott Kelby's ""Photoshop 6 Photo-Retouching Secrets"" or Martin Evening's ""Adobe Photoshop 6.0 for Photographers"" (this one is for more advanced readers) and see for yourself."
2,You Can Do Better......,"What a difference a year makes in digital photography! Or 5 years come to that. Having bought the book, 50 Fast Digital Photo Techniques, it was immediately clear that the techniques and tips were aimed at beginning photoshop workers. Nothing wrong with that. However, by today's standards, there are many more attractive books on the market that do the same thing so much better and with much better quality illustrations and colour photgraphs. I found the tips a bit 'old hat' and the illustrations very old hat, the sort of tips and techniques you could easily pick up in an hour's search on the net, AND with better colour examples.Still, to keep things in perspective, the book IS 5 years old and it shows.Buy it if you want a cheap second-hand book for your shelf. Otherwise, you can do much, much better with the scores of other visually attractive beginner/intermediate books on today's market."
1,50 Fast Digital Photo Techniques,"I have a Gateway Computer with Windows XP, 512 ram and 80 GB hard drive. This book is not up-to-date to handle Windows XP because the instructions from each chapter do not allow you to follow the directions. An example: in chapter 1, ""remove a color cast"", I brought up the wedding picture and could not follow the instructions to correct the color cast. This continued with many of the instructions in the ongoing chapters. I believe that the cd rom needs an update for Windows XP."
1,Useless information,"This book concentrates on nothing at all that I could find. Information on lighting, color and composition, angle, equipment are just rushed through, and leaves you holding the bag, so to speak. All the information that you NEED to know is left out, where information that anyone who has used a camera for more than a month already should know, is covered throughout the entire book, chapter after chapter. Useless book, unless you are an ABSOLUTE BEGINNER and have never seen a digital camera operated before, buy something else. Oh, and the included software is only good when you uninstall it.I don't like getting ripped off, and after purchasing this book, I'll never buy anything who was associated with this obviously slapped together POS. And I don't think you can call ""take the photos again if you don't like them"" a technique. Which is mentioned in the book about 50 times... YIKES."
2,Dissapointed in cover and description,"Looking at the book's cover and at the now defunct editor's description, there was no indication this book was primarily aimed at - and indeed was written for - Photoshop Elements users. The copy said it was also for Photoshop users but it only covers through version 6 and the introduction says using applications other than Elements for the actions described may not work.I've not used Elements so I have no idea whether the book will be helpful there. It's certainly not helpful for me.I'm a professional using Photoshop CS and thought some of the tips might be worthwhile. I also use PaintShopPro 8. I thought some of this book might be worthwhile for me but I'm nothing but dissapointed."
5,Fantastic,"My family and I are actually from Brasil. I found this CD at a Best Buy on sale for $5, and out of curiosity, I bought it. I LOVED it. My relatives loved it. The poster who said that the songs on this CD aren't authentic to Brasil obviously is not Brasilian. This CD got passed around my family so much, that I don't even know who has it anymore. I want another copy, which I plan to NOT share. So now I need to buy it again. It really is that good. I first bought it about 10 years ago, and it's still a hit with me and my family. One of the best."
3,Better Bossa Nova collections out there,"I haven't had much luck with trying to get good Brazilian music lately. This is just ok, not the type of Bossa Nova that you would usually think about with Brazil."
3,"jazzy, upbeat bossa nova","This collection is different from what I knew as bossa nova. It's jazzier and more upbeat. It's not exactly what I thought I would get, but I like it."
5,Bossa Nova Brasil,I play this CD frequently. Love the choices of artists and songs. Shows off the legacy of some of the artists as well. Would recommend it to the many fans of Bossa Nova and Brazilian music in general.
3,Not a page-turner...,"A golden age murder mystery where there is a finite number of suspects in a confined setting -- this time a university area locked down at night with only a few people having keys.I got through the book in time, but found it a tough go occasionally. A few too many side diversions, some of which including characters I wasn't sure even belonged in the story. The solution is a bit crazy, but I was so glad to be done with it, that I took it in stride.Not a page-turner, but ok if nothing else is available and you are into books set in English schools."
1,"Waste of money, cheating!","this is not a dvd to watch! it is only audio music of brad paisley, with 2 stupid background slides. they are not even real photos, just digitally created. a big cheat if you expect to see somehting of brad paisley..."
4,AWESOME ADIDAS,"THESE ARE FANTASTIC! White and silver, great ADIDAS quality! Bought these for my 6YR old niece, she was a little put-off by the ""HOT WHEELS"" logo on the velcro flap and the silver HOT WHEELS BUCKLE at the base of the shoe laces - which I hadn't noticed and was the ONLY REASON for 4 stars instead of 5 ... BUT! These are great shoes and I highly recommend them. (just notice the HOT WHEELS details and don't get them for the ""GIRLY-GIRLS"" in your life.)"
2,BOLLYWOOD,"This movie was only worth watching because of Hrithik Roshan--great talent. He has the ability to turn a horrible script into a semi-masterpiece, if given the right costar...which unfortunately was not the case here. His costar over-acted throughout the entire movie--she singlehandedly was able to kill whatever life Hrithik was able to give to the script. I saw her in 2 movies and that was two too many...the other was Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage, also with Hrithik Roshan...Unless you are a huge fan of his and feel the need to watch all his movies, don't bother with these two."
4,"Love the cut, but it's not what is pictured.","I love the cup. It doesn't leak or spill & it's easy to clean and use. My only complaint is that it's not what is pictured. However, it still has cinderella on it & my daughter loves it...so no harm done. But if you're buying this cup for something specific (say color or picture)....you might want to look elsewhere."
1,Don't Buy it,I had a ton of problems getting all the programs loaded with XP. I e-mailed and called Roxio 13 times. Their service and support ranks dead last.
3,decent book.,"Being a long time sufferer of psoriasis I can say that this book didn't tell me anything I didn't know already. But then again I have battled and won for the last 16 years of my life. And if many of the suferers out there are as jaded as I am, then we all know whats best and thats that.There are many people out there that, I think, would benifit from the information provided in this book. Namely children or teenagers living in a family where they are the only sufferers. It can be hard if no one around you knows whats going on with the condition. This book provides enough information to help educate the families and sufferers as to whats going on and good treatment alternatives. There are some interesting sections devoted to stress and diet and UVB that would be a great starting point for many afflicted recently or those looking for a good starting point for there children."
3,I did not particularly enjoy this book.,"I found the writing somewhat stilted and self-conscious and the story less charming than others in this genre. The narrative focused more on the author and his wife than on the locals and village life. I much prefer ""From Here You Can't See Paris,"" ""On Rue Tatin"" by Susan Herrman Loomis and Virgile's Vineyard"" by Patrick Moon."
4,Shared Vision,"After reading several other Zig Ziglar books, I picked up this one and was thrilled to find that it was an easy to read guide full of practical advice on creating success in your own life. One of the best pieces of advice was to help others reach their own goals. That is an incredibly powerful way to help change the world and empower yourself in the process."
4,"Good, but the Christian stuff scares me","I really enjoyed reading this book. It is a great motivater and any time I need a kick in the butt or am feeling down I pick up the book and get going. However, I was very put off by his constant references to Jesus Christ. It got a little preacher which put a bad taste in my mouth when I was trying to read the rest of the book. Too bad, otherwise I loved it."
1,Do I need to be a Christian to be successful?,"Zig Ziglar strongly insinuates that we need to accept Jesus as our savior to be truly happy and successful. I think he should change the title of this book to ""Christianity for Dummies."" I have no interest in his religious preachings but I got one from this book in a very annoying undertone."
1,Success for Dummies,"This book is an incredible pile of transparent, self-righteous, right wing extremist propaganda. It is a shame that a publisher that normally produces books that are so universally useful should come out with something like this. It advocates Christianity (use the bible as your business guide) and sexual abstinence as requirements for success. It uses pathetic examples and gives no real practical advice. You got to read this to believe what trash it is. A book that truly challenges the 1st Amendment! Pity I had to give it a star."
5,"This book is not only helpful, but entertaining.","I did not purchase this book necessarily because I was searching for success, but because I knew it would be an interesting read. I truly enjoyed reading Success For Dummies because it was entertaining and helpful at the same time. Some self-help books are packed with too much information, too many strategies or just not arranged in a readable fashion. I knew I could rely on the For Dummies publishers to present the information in a way that would keep me reading. Zig Ziglar brings the reader in and through anecdotal evidence from his own life, convinces the reader he too, can succeed. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is on the road to success and needs a little encouragement and entertainment along the way."
5,Zig's new book is THE complete reference guide to SUCCESS!,"No other book is needed. This is the ONLY guide you'll need to be happy, successful, and content in life.Zig, you ARE the best.Thanks you for a great masterpiece."
5,Duane does it again,"Probably the emotional high point of the series, this book culminates in a great fiasco that spans the entire universe in its scope. It is mostly science fiction, but it takes a stronger look at the Christian mythos that the series has in the background of all the characters. Nita and Kit are played down a great deal, with Dairine stealing most of the ""screen time."" For some this may be a let down, but how often can you do the same thing over and over again. I argue that this should be the last book in the series, since the next two books in the wizardry series never succeed in topping the dramatic events of this one."
4,cool book,I thought this was an interesting book. But it focused on darine more than Nita and kit so in my oppinion it could have been better. I love the series though
3,almost there...,"i really like all of the other books in the series but until now i hadn't read this one. nita always seems to think that dairine is a brat, so by the time you get to dairine's point of view you can't feel any sympathy for her. but about the book in general... dairine is a brilliant girl who always wants to learn more. she gets a hold on her sister nita's wizard maunal and takes the oath, though her manual is a new computer. the book is the story of her ordeal, the ordeal of one of the most(prbably the most) powerful wizards of all times. read i. its good"
3,"good, but dribbles off","this book starts out ok but goes down to a terrible end. A Wizard Abroad is much better, along with Deep Wizardry and So you want to be a Wizard. A weak spot in a strong Series, I tells how Nita's annoying sister,a wizard wannabe, goes through her ordeal..."
3,"I liked it, but not the best","In my opinion, this wasn't up to Duane's usual standards. I did enjoy this book, but not so much as the other three in the series. A reason that I might not have liked this book as much as the others is that I like hearing about Kit and Nita.In this book, Dairine Calahan, Nita's little sister, takes the Oath and, with her computer manual, finds herself on a different planet in a galaxy millions of light years from her own. While on this planet she meets some kinky little robots and the Lone Power. Meanwhile, Kit and Nita are desperately trying to find her and her trail is getting cold..."
1,Older reader disappointed,"I am an older reader who enjoyed the Harry Potter books and I thought this series might be fun to read. I was very disappointed.On page 102 the author states, in third person narrative, that 1) the earth spins at 17,000 mph, 2) the earth travels in its orbital path at 175,000 mph and 3) that the sun travels at 115,000 mph. These are all grossly incorrect. 1) should be 1040 mph. 2) should be 67,000 mph, and 3) is 490,000 mph.Some may consider this unimportant. But why should readers be exposed to 'facts' that seem to be just made up. Scientific facts are not trivia. On page 145 the author uses light-years as a unit of time. This is the mark of a true ignoramus.Everything else about this book is at this level. The plot, the descriptions, the action sequences would barely get a C- in freshman English. How did this get in print?"
3,"Good book, it but could be better","I adore the Wizardry series, and while I enjoyed this book, it didn't fascinate me or grab like the others in the series have. Dairine seems to have enough talents already, without needing to add another item to the list of things she can do better than her older sister. Nita and Kit are more likable characters by far than Dairine, and I'm afraid that I don't understand why she needed a novel focusing on her. Why not a novel with a focus on Kit? Dairine's expertise in everything gave me a deeper appreciation of the other characters, who try hard, have flaws, have interesting relationships, and have limitations in their abilities, as opposed to a better understanding of Dairine as a person and a character. This book is good... but not the best in this wonderful series."
1,Frightful,"This book. What can I say? If the theology/morality wasn't so pointless, affectated and plain ridiculous (more on that in a second), it would still be a crime against humanity on the part of the publishers.The writing style is banal, flat and unimaginative, the characterisation is poorly thought out and unbelievable (Dairine suddenly transforms into a different person halfway through the book, and the parrot/goddess...don't get me started. Nita and Kit are as they always were, in their ways and in their relations with each other, and the Lone Power, unbelievably, goes through a completely ludicrous character change.) Also, it has a falsely sentimental overtone, the jokes are childish and- well, it just ... all round.About the theology. It's just rehashed Judeo-Christian philosophy with a little boring physics and calculus thrown in. Pu-lease.In short, just read something else."
4,Another great read,"Once I finished ""Deep Wizardry"", I was desperate to know what would happen with Dairine, Nita's little sister and Diane Duane didn't disappoint!"
4,High Wizardry,"This book is really great! How Dairine got the computer talking was weird and how she went to Mars! She got on a big computer chip, and got a weird friend with fourteen legs. I think this book is cool and a bit weird."
1,Sycophantic History of Bad Science,"It's hard to imagine how anyone could view this book as an objective history of the Intelligent Design movement. Thomas Woodward has taken men who have had no effect on the practice of science and uncritically lionized them as martyrs to a revolution that isn't happening.Aside from that, the writing style is overbearingly florid and grandiloquent. It's clear Woodward is enamoured of the men of whom he is writing, and has written this book with the intent of being the first to write a history of a movement he is convinced will have great influence in the future. Unfortunately for Woodward and his friends, one hundred years from now the ID movement will be little more than a footnote in history, along with phrenology, cold fusion, crystal power, and other ideas which have no basis in evidence or logic."
1,othello classic books on cassette,The reading is very monotonous as the reader says the names of each part before the part is read. It drives my students as well as myself crazy. We get through the reading faster by just reading the parts ourselves. I was very disappointed with the purchase.
1,Arkangel usually outstanding...but,"The Arkangel audio CD's of Shakespeare's plays have an outstanding reputation. Most are really first rate and are quite enjoyable to listen to. Hamlet, MacBeth and Julius Caesar are very well done, complete plays well interpreted. Which is all the more baffling as to why Othello and Merchant of Venice are so notably bad. The overall productions and main players seem to have been chosen to project caricature rather than serious adaptation. That may be a fair point in a class room, but these two plays deserve a serious presentation."
1,This sucks,"Look, here it is. I know everyone says how great and everything Othello is and that this Shakespeare guy is like a genius. But what it comes down to is it is just like this white guy from Ireland who never went to Italy and stuff and like all his plays all take place there and stuff. I mean, did Shakespeare actually know someone named Romeo? But that's not the point. This whole play sucks. I didn't get involved at all and I couldn't relate to none of the characters. Plus when my teacher said that Othello is actually black, I, as a white person, took offense to it. So to all you out there in cyber space, just avoid this no matter what. And if you were like assigned it for class say that you won't tolerate racial prejudice. Or read the Cliff Notes, like I did."
1,The worst Iago ever,"Knowing Cyril Cusack from his affecting performance of Egeon in the BBC version of 'The Comedy of Errors', I'm suprised by his laughable portrayal of Iago here: the silly whining and hammy delivery of the lines throughout is a trial to listen to. If only he was given the role of the Clown instead..."
2,Iagogo,"As dull as unbuttered toast; the only thing worth mentioning (briefly) is Ewan McGregor's Iago. Young, cheerful, well-spoken and winning, McGregor is the most charming Iago I have encountered in any medium. For awhile, that is very nearly enough. One understands why people like and trust this man; one also understands why no one takes him seriously as lieutenant material. But as the play progresses and Iago's cruelty deepens, McGregor's unvarying amiability seems incongruous. A strange countertextual interpretation emerges, reminiscent of Auden's trickster theory but with a novel twist of its own. In brief, Iago tries to play a harmless joke on Othello, only to see his prank spiral out of control. The poor man is forced to improvise desperately as he struggles to resolve the mess he unwittingly created. Iago as the Boy who Cried Adulteress, a feckless but innocent victim of events: that is indeed a novel take on the play, and it would be fascinating if it weren't ludicrous."
3,None,Although this is an interesting book to browse it has not worked well as a reference source for college studies. Searches for what I consider to be common ecological terms and concepts usually end up with no results found. Perhaps the book is not intended as a reference manual.
4,Some people forget that Shakespeare wrote historical plays,"Shakespeare's play King Henry includes comedy, history, and passion. You may find yourself to side with the rebels and cheer on Lord Percy. The only downside to reading Henry IV part one, is that you might have to do your homework to understand what is going on in this era. After reading this play, go see it in the theater if you can!"
4,Big Boom!,"This mix album just rocks. I used to have (or still own) the vinyl record with some unmixed songs. I never however used to own the CD. Since the songs are rocking I was wondering if the mix is any good. And - 10 years after it was created - the mix sounds amazingly young and retro at the same time.CD1 is probably the more house/big beat influenced one. The transitions are not always perfect, however the songs that Jon Carter chose are. Hits like ""Dooms Night "" (Timo Maas Remix) or ""Maracana Madness"" are perfectly blended together with less famous bout not less raving tunes as ""Watch me now"" from Grooveyard.CD2 is a bit less big beat and more techno influenced (without loosing the house party feeling). Timo Maas, Luke Slater, Tony Rohr etc. Great stuff and definitely fitting for the time when the CD was mixed. Nowadays, as I mentioned before, there is a retro feeling, but in a good way."
3,Warming Up to Religious Hardcore!!,"Blinded Colony's first album comes in as hard as any metal band should; fast, loud, angry. But upon deeper inspection you realize that there's greater meaning to the songs and words. It's a warm up for anyone out there looking for good religious metal but haven't found it."
4,great toy for gross motor,"My kids love this! Good toy for playing in the house or out, great price and the best part is that it folds up nicely to be stored out of the way. I give it only four stars because the piping that gives it its form can be a bit of a stinger on the knees."
5,My cat loves it!!!!!,"I actually bought this tunnel for my cat, and she loves it! The idea occurred to me because I bought a desk which came in a tall thin box and my cat turned it into a playhouse, sliding into it and bringing her toys in. I got the tunnel about 3 wks ago and it has become her haven: she loves to slide in it, and to have me throw her toys in so she can slide in after them and play with them. Also, whenever she's upset about anything, it has become the place where she automatically goes. Another great part is that it collapses into a 17"" circle and weighs virtually nothing, so whenever I have company I just put it away and it doesn't clutter. If you have an active cat, especially if you're away from the house a lot, this is great!"
2,Deceptive Pictures,"The picture on the Amazon.com page is actually of two (2) of the products together. I was extremely dissapointed when I found out it was actually half of what I was expecting to receive, and for what I paid a high price. The toy may be durable, but it is DECEIVING to have a picture of 2 tunnels attached and sell only one...it's not fair!"
4,"love playing hide and seek, this is it.",This is a great toy when you are having more kids around the house for a party or playgroup. It keeps kids busy for a long time. It is also very light weight so the kids can also carry it along with them from room to room. It's well padded on the wires. Seems like we'll end up with it forever.
5,Neon See-Me connecting Tunnel,I think this is a really cool toy. I do have an uncoventional use for it. Dog agility training in the house. My dachshund Duke loves it and he hasn't torn it up yet and that is saying something.
5,Dog agility,"After reading other reviews,I, too, purchased this to use to practice agility with our dog. I wasn't sure it would be large enough. She is an English Setter. It works perfectly for this size of dog. She is approx. 35 lbs, med. size dog.Cindy"
3,a disappointment,I must admit I found this a disappointment. I bought it for a rainy day activity for my 15 month old son and he likes it ok. But it is really a narrow tunnel. He fits in it fine now but forget about me chasing after him. My 9 yr old nephew didn't even want to play with it because it was way too small for him. Not sure this has lasting play appeal for years to come.
3,A bit of fun,"First of all, this game is nothing like the PES-brand you might be used to play. It has simple graphics, sound and gameplay. Unlike, for that matter, the PSP version.Out of this, it's a pretty catchy game, although very, very easy.By now, I would recommend look for a more recent version of the game."
3,Why Three? The sound is just OK by todays standards.,"Most imports go through post 96' mastering to bring out the best fidelity, but this one was made in. . . . 1983!! Thats 22 years ago, so you can imagine where cd transfers were at during that time; o, and I did order a copy of this cd and returned it based on this issue, not the music. jb"
1,baaad,"This book the worst aquarium books I own. It is not a very good encyclopedia, and I find the whole ""ease of keeping"" thing rather hard to understand. The information is sometimes incorrect. The only thing that stopped me from giving it one star was its beautiful pictures of fish (although the variatus platy is upside down!). Overall, this is not a very useful book for the aquarium fish hobbyist."
5,My kids love it!,"This parachute is a lot of fun! Kids come up with all kinds of uses for it, but our favorite game is to put the baby underneath the parachute in the middle and just pull it up and down. He gets a kick out of it and the older kids love to see his reaction.This one is bigger than I thought it would be, which is a good thing, but unfortunately we actually don't have enough people to play with it when my husband is not home. If each person holds onto 2 handles it can fit about 5-6 people around. But if you have only 3 people to play with, while it still works, it's more fun with more people. But I guess that's the way all games/toys should be!Definitely recommend this for outdoor (or indoor with a lot of room) activities with lots of kids!"
5,The most popular item in our playroom,My girls are 5 and 3 and have played with this parachute everyday since the day they got it. It is wonderful for promoting imaginative play. I would highly reommend this item.
5,great fun for all,"For the past several years I have vollunteered at my kids' school for their anual field day, and I am always assigned the parachute activity. From grades K-5 most kids chose this as their favorite. There are so many games and activities for this simple parachute, I even enjoy them with the kids. So of course I had to buy one for home. I have three kids ages 8, 7, and 3; we all have fun together."
4,Lots of fun,"I bought this for my nieces and nephews and we use it at birthday parties. The kids love it, and it is surprisingly durable."
1,They canceled my order!,"I ordered this as a Christmas gift on 12/13. On 12/19 I received an email that they canceled my order, the end. No explanation, nothing. (Other than my card would not be charged) I had to pay expedited shipping somewhere else to get a gift delivered by Christmas. Extremely unprofessional business practice to wait so long on the notification of cancellation."
2,ZOOM IN OR OUT,"Alvin Lee Zoom album is a non pretentious work, but a truly well done one. Simple, direct, great... From start to end is music at its best, to be joyful, to dance, no matter if the lyrics are sad or happy, it fullfills the quest of making musical sounds!"
2,"I loved the other books, but . . . .","The first three books of the Wizard series are three of my all-time favorite books. They are extraordinarily well-crafted and wonderfully intriguing. It's easy to sympathize with the characters.Imagine my surprise when I read #4. Ugh. The characters have lost their individuality. The plot is thick, convoluted, and unexplained.If you don't own the first three books, BUY THEM RIGHT NOW! But don't waste your time on this one."
1,this book sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(many more !s),""" A Wizard Abroad [wizardry series NO.4]"" this was not even a good book to go with the wizardry series. The only good parts of the book are as follow: 1. It takes place in ireland. 2. It has custom spells. 3. Most of the people are wizards. 4. Theres one kiss in it 5. The main character is a girl. And there are many things i hated about it i'll give you five examples. 1. There are few spells in it. 2. The spells where weak and pitiful. 3. Everyone is a wizard. 4. There are few battles. 5. The kiss at the end took up two pages. So, as you can see the book sucked in almost all aspects"
5,By far the best,"Ok, i loved it. it's my favorite in the young wizards series, of which i've read everyone but the first.(dont ask.) it takes place in irlend, which rocks, and has cool history in it. it's got lots of Darine, ho is cool, but not quite enough Kit, who is the best. Nita is the main charecter, for those who have read the others.PS i know I'D be jelous if i were kit!"
2,Wizard Abroad,"So predictable... I'd rather read a boring school textbook than this. =/ Sorry, Ms. Duane."
2,No Offence but why do we need the Blow-in,"It's Ironic that Ronan asked this question. In truth this should have been his story, and He, not Nita, should have been the one to tell it.As it is we get the view from the outside, with a narrator who isn't quite perseptive enough to give us the whole story. And if Nita's place in this story is somewhat periperal then the other young wizards from the previous books are even more so.Kit is the proverbial 3rd wheel, and Dairine is used as nothing more then a convnient power source.I loved the first two books inis series, was disappointed by the third and am sad to say that the story line hasn't recovered in the Fourth. Like its imediat predesor this book feels like the darkness has delibertly been toned down, and frequently omitted, preferring to report the fighting with passages about what Nita remembered rather than dropping us into the thick of it.As a result I just couldn't find anything to get involved with in this story,"
4,"Not the best in the series, but okay.","I love this series. And this is a wonderful book, but I like Deep Wizardry much better. Poor Nita is shipped off to Ireland, and gets into some pretty dangerous wizardry. That's okay with me. But she also meets this boy.... And then falls in love with him... And I think it was pretty mean to desert Kit after all that time. I do really like it though. But I hope with all my heart that the boy Nita met doesn't have any part in the next book."
2,Good but not great,"I found the fourth book of this series a sad departure from what made the previous books great. It moves the overall story line further, but its a step i wish i could have skipped"
3,so-so,"I was disappointed at this book, because the previous ones had been great. At first I thought that the plot could really turn into something big, but then it just fizzled out. The battles just didn't have the same impact as they did in the other books. In the other books, you really felt the importance of all of the battles, because you felt like the whole universe depended on the outcome of one battle. With this, it was sort of like, okay, so what that there's a battle. I finished the book, but mostlly because I felt that if I didn't read it, I would be majorly confused in the next books. It was sort of like she just stopped writing the book, and had someone else write it for her because she didn't want to write it. I would not recommend buying this book alone, because its biggest value is having information that you would need in the next books."
5,grrrreat,love it if you want a good book about wizardry this is it my mom likes it to its good for grown ups too i was in a like state where nothing could break me from it and i play like i am nita some times what she does with the lone power is incredible
5,go abroad in your american home!,"i received this book for christmas having never heard of it i was a bit ""if'ie"" to start reading. turns out that i was totally wrong! this is one of the best books i have ever read. When Nita gets shiped of against her will to her aunt in ireland, which she has nothing to do with (she thinks) all on acount of her wizarding partner Kit. soon she finds herself in a deep mission that takes all of the wizards from ireland and more! on the way she finds herself in love with Ronan a fellow wizard who thinks of her as a ""blow in"" and is very disturbed when he finds his part in the mission the up most very important. shall they beat the lone power once more for a bit of peace? or will they get blown down in an eternal death of darkness never to come out of it again? the truth is shocking, yet so are the lies."
4,"good, but not the best","While not as emotionally satisfying as the first two in the series, and while definitely lacking the presence of Kit to balance out Nina, it is still a well written, enjoyable part of the series. As with all Duane's books, it manages to be accessible without being condescending, and it is a YA book that can be happily reread by those of us who no longer fit the age bracket."
3,The Long Long Trailer,Funny. A easy read. I got some good practical information about trailer/RV life. Sounds fun to do.
3,Not bad but too electronic...,"I have all three albums of the series, which doesn't mean they are my favorite. My impressionis that Paul's way of arranging and playing in the series including this album is not like that of his previous albums. I think he used too much electronic sound and failed to give listeners unique tension and attraction his music only has. (Interestingly, he didn't lose his own taste in his album ""The best of France"" with the same electronic expression.) He just did rendition in this album that any musicians can imitate easily.I expected a real different style of playing classical music from him but knew I was wrong."
4,Pretty good video,A good video with info on the whole starlight issue. A bit over the head for most on the science end but still very helpfull.
2,"SADLY, IT WAS BORING.","I had previously read and purchased the book ""Starlight and Time"" which was excellent. When I saw the DVD for sale I couldn't wait to get IT thinking a visual might even bring the subject matter even closer to the understanding. Alas, it is mostly two very smart, but also very UN-charismatic personalities droning on and on about the topic that had been so utterly clear and facinating in print! BUY the book, but don't even bother with this DVD rendition."
3,Effortless reading,"A quick read. I did not find it as riveting as Schaub's first novel, 'Finding Anna'. Perhaps there just wasn't enough material to more fully develop the various characters. Still, if you enjoyed reading her first in the Music of the Heart series, do read 'The Longing Season'. I like to read other novels that a particular author are written in order to get a sense of the writer's style and interests."
5,Wonderful story of all time favorite hymn,"Like a reviewer before me, this, too, is my favorite hymn. And Schaub does an outstanding job of telling the story of John Newton, the man who penned the lyrics that were born of his own realization of just how amazing is God's grace."
4,Disney CD,"The CD arrive damaged (Music would skip) We contacted the seller, and they immediately refunded our money. We would certainly buy from this seller again even though there was a problem with the disk"
5,The Polar Express is a classic!,The soundtrack from this film is a winner. From Kate Smith to Bing Crosby plus Steven Tyler and Josh Groban? This music will put you in the mood for Christmas!
3,"Great score, but mediocre release","Far too much of this score (6 songs) can be found elsewhere and far more of Silvestri's majestic score should have been on this CD. The original songs are a mixed bag, with Tyler's ""Rockin' On Top of the World"" being a blast, Groban's ""Believe"" being hauntingly appealing, but somewhat shakily performed and the kids' ""When Christmas Comes to Town"" being very cliched and overly sweet.A pity that this score was just what I expected, but those compiling it should have taken a lesson from the highly successful CD from ""Home Alone"" and presented a REAL soundtrack, not this hodge-podge."
5,"A good blend of family friendly holiday music, movie songs, classic Chistmas songs, popular, adult contemporary, rock, standards","The Polar Express soundtrack is one of our family favorites, the music spans from the music in the movie that the characters sing, to the Josh Groban song everyone is looking for, to the Standards Christmas Singers (Andrews Sisters, Bing Crosby) and to finish it all of Aerosmith's Rockin' on Top of the World.This cd runs the gamut, and it's great for the whole family."
3,"If you love the movie, you'll enjoy this CD","We enjoy most of this CD, but it could have been a lot better......but it's nice to have if you like the movie."
4,Holiday Classic,I bought this an Gosh Groban's Noel for the holiday. I absolutely love this CD. It will become a holiday classic. I do not care for the Steve Tyler track bust that's what forward button is for.
4,Fabulous!!!,I really enjoyed this cd. Music is crucial in my life and I have always loved this story. It is a nice compilation of new orchestral compositions as well as what some of us might consider traditional Christmas music. I enjoyed it a lot and look forward to adding this cd to my music collection.
3,Polar Express CD,Took forever to get the CD. The origianl CD was lost but then replaced.The CD is fine.
3,Missing Track(s),There's an instrumental in the Movie that gets my blood flowing that's missing from this soundtrack; The same instrumental is also in the Beginning of the ELF Movie but is absent from that soundtrack as well; Obviously it's a classic x-mas song but I cannot find it's title; Anyone have any idea?email me @ mcavallu@suffolk.lib.ny.us if you know!
5,Magic,"Perfect ""sing-a-long"" CD especially if you've seen the movie or read the book. The Polar Express has been and continues to be my great-grandson's favorite book and DVD. He loves to hear the CD as we're driving regardless of what time of year it is. At 5 he has memorized the whole soundtrack. His only comment is that the songs are not in the order they were played in the DVD and recognized that right away."
1,WHERE IS THE ENTIRE SCORE????!!!!!!,I am a reasonably big fan of Alan Silvestri's scores and it is a shame that they dont have the score to the polar express available. The score to Who Framed Roger Rabbit is also a great score and it is no longer available either. By purchasing the polar express soundtrack I feel cheated because It only has three tracks form composer Alan silvestri. What a shame!!!!
2,muzak to my ears,"Other than being somewhat surprised that Tom Hanks can sing as well as he can, there is very little in this soundtrack that I find interesting. The old material is, well...old. The newer material is lacking in anything particularly compelling."
5,I will definately be buying this!,"This album has some awesome songs from the movie on it!I want to get it cause it has ""When Christmas Comes To Town"" where the girl and boy sing together.That is just such a magical track!So,I will definately be picking this up before Christmas!"
5,Quality,Superb quality that I love very much. The CD has all the same songs from the Polar Express movie plus more.
4,Very Good for the FE Examination,"An easy to read test preparation guide, which helps you to refresh fundamental concepts quickly.Out of the 13 chapters of this book, there are 116 problems and solutions( arranged under 10 chapter headings). Further there are two practice tests with 120 problems and detailed answers.The Ethics section is presented with NSPE cases and analyzed in a masterly manner, therby helping the reader to grasp the nuances well.This book's value would have been greatly enhanced, if the solutions had been worked out in a manner that encouraged the use of NCEES FE Reference Handbook."
1,You Better All Ready Know This Stuff !!!,"If your'e going to take the EIT test, you better all ready know everything in this book. Because this book is not going to teach it to you. This book is purely a reminder of things that you better know if you want to pass. You also better understand how everything in this book relates to everything else in this book.Many of the equations are wrong. The topics it covers jump around. Transitions from one step to the next are ""purposely"" missing.Final Thought: If you all ready know everything in this book, why buy it?"
2,FE-EIT PM - General Engineering (REA) - The,I was not as impressed as other books I used to prepare for this test. This book had a few grammer and miss spelled words so it wasnt up to the standards I had for it.
5,Nantucket,"I have a B60 and only brew the small cup size, because the large size makes the coffee seem watered down. This is problem with all the KCUPS I've tried. I did purchase a large selection of the Green Mountain coffee and I really like Lake and Lodge and Dark Magic. I prefer the stronger blends over the milder flavored choices."
2,Warm Brown Water,"That's what my mother said, and she doesn't even like strong coffee! We got her a Keurig machine for Christmas, and so far have had fun trying the various K-Cups. Mom is leaning towards Wake-Up Call as an everyday coffee, and my wife and I (who drink Jeremiah's Pick Fogbuster or Longbottom Black Gold as our morning cup) think that's good, too. So, to keep this short, Nantucket Blend doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't have much flavor. If you like your coffee very mild/weak, you might love it. If you like stronger, bolder, darker blends, forget about it."
5,A New Household Favorite,"I bought this because my boyfriend likes Green Mountain coffee, but had not tried this blend before. He loved it so much, he requested I buy it every time we get new K cups! It is perfect for breakfast wake up, and even smells good to me, a non-drinker of coffee!"
2,Wishy Washy,"I wouldn't consider myself a coffee connoisseur, but I do know what I like and this is not it. I found this coffee weak and watery. I ran it in the smallest cup size that my machine makes and it was still weak.I will admit that the flavor wasn't bad, but there just wasn't enough of it. It tasted like I got a half packed cup. This was one that came as a sample with my Keurig system. I normally prefer French Roast, Sumatran Reserve, Dark Magic - you know something with a kick. But even the Breakfast Blend that I purchased had more flavor. Suffice to say this should be very low on your list if you want something that has a reasonable volume of flavor."
1,Not Sticky,"I was using this on a very heavy traffic tiled area... it came up after one day. The adhesive is not sticky at all. This is fine if nobody is going to touch it, but if anybody is going to be stepping on it or rolling over it (especially on a tiled area), I recommend something stronger."
4,Good basic text for point set topology,"I taught a one semester course on basic point set topology out of this book. The emphasis in the first half is on metric spaces, which provide the most natural class of examples for the basic principles of point set topology that any student taking a course in topology must know about. There is little extraneous material, and I found that the students thought the book was very good. This was a group of students at a regional campus of a large state university, and I would recommend the book for a beginning course at a comparable campus. Those teaching at research institutions will want more."
5,Best of the Cuban Music.,The music of The Cuarteto Mayari is the best of the golden era of the cuban music. The way the guitar was play when this music was recorded is not the way that the guitar is play today. On those days the cords on the guitar were made of steel and not of plastic material as they are today. It was a unique way to play the guitar. This is history today and it is treasure to have this records for the future.
3,BABY IS NOT TOO INTO THIS,"My baby doesn't pay much attention to this toy ... every now and then he'll play with the crinkley paws and ears, and rarely with the tags. I thought he'd like this because he usually plays with manufacturer tags on things, but not so much with the tags on this."
2,Chronicles of Narnia - The Silver Chair,"Disappointing version of the C.S. Lewis book. One of the more exciting novels in the series, but this miniseries is just dull and boring. The acting is amateur and I discovered recently that Camilla Power who plays Jill in this miniseries, was known in the Czech culture for a dubb voice in the Czech movie, ""Alice"" by Jan Svankmajer. Oh, such talent! Not all what I was expecting. Skip this part, if you can."
1,waste of money,"i bought this movie because i enjoyed the lion, witch and the wardrobe, but this movie is like a home video, it stunk, even my six year old grandson did not like it, i feel i wasted my money"
1,"Boring, Horribly slow, Makes Aslan look MEAN","I hate to give a bad review for anything related to Narnia, but this depiction of The Silver Chair, was soooooo bad. It was so slow and boring that me and my two boys, ages 8 and 6, could literally not sit through it. The ""special effects"" are so bad its just funny. But the worst part for me was the voice and manner of Aslan -- he looks and sounds like an angry, mean, horrible beast (the voice is that of an angry, ignorant, stubborn old man). I didn't mind that my kids weren't interested in watching the whole thing since I didn't want them to have that image of Aslan in their heads!"
1,Sad I bought it,"After watching the Disney versions of Chronicles and Prince Caspian, I didn't realize the Silver Chair was not a Disney film. I was so shocked to see such a bad production of a story. The acting was so bad, the entire thing was so poorly done. If you have seen the Disney films, you must know just what I mean. I'm sorry I bought this one, guess I will donate it to my local Library. Hopefully Disney will make this one too, and I would certainly buy that one."
2,The BBC Series Of The Chronicles Of Narnai,I found this series to be quite disapointing. The BBC version seemed very plastic. The actors were too theatrical and their acting too over the top. Characters like Reepicheep were played by dwarfs and the whole thing seemed too stiff. I wish someone would take hold of this wonderful series of books by C S Lewis and make a decent go of it like Harry Potter.
1,B-rated film,"I wanted to get all the sequences of "" The Chronicles of Narnia"". However, this film is so B-rated that it's hard to continue watching, when I've already seen the others. I mean better graphics, script, everything."
5,Unfinished movies,"I am really 16, I just don't have a login name so this would be easier to say. I love the narnia videos, this is probably my favorite of them all. I have tried to look all over to see if there were any future plans to comlpete the videos and I foudn one thing. Jim Henson had started to make a remake of the lion, the witch, and the wardrboe, but sadly after his death it was shut down."
1,"very, very weak","It's amazing how weak this album is. The drum programming is tedious and sounds banal as do the riffs and the production. THis is a truly terrible album probably the worst most uninspiring thing I've ever had the mispleasure of hearing. I was so put off by this album I never gave them a second chance so I don't know if their other albums are any good, I do know that Rosetta Stone's Adrenaline and the Sisters of Mercy's - First and Last and Always are infinitely better examples of this programmed drum gothic rock type schtick."
1,wait till you hear the real thing,There is no comparison between this and other Nosferatu albums and Bernard J Taylor's masterpiece. Save your money.
2,sharp edges,Love the design but the raised relief on the band itself is very sharp and catches on clothing and can easily scratch skin.
2,Unhappy!,This ring looks great online but once I received it I was disappointed. Maybe it's because I only got one but I was not happy with it and I must say I will be returning this item. It looks so much better online than what it did when I got it. In my opinion even if I would of bought more than one its not worth the $ that they are asking for. This seller does have a very nice presentation when u receive your package and you will recieve your purchase within the promised time frame.
2,Minnetonka women's myke fisherman sandals,"Nice materials. Not much support in the footbed, sandal runs loose. I normally take at least a medium width but these sandals are really too loose and I've adjusted them to make them as tight as possible."
4,Murder on the Scotland Express,"The 11th film in Universal's series of Sherlock Holmes films starring Basil Rathbone as the Great Detective and Nigel Bruce as his faithful companion, Dr. Watson.With only one more film to go following this 1946 release, it's not surprising that there's little fresh about this entry, but it hardly matters. The draw is still Rathbone and Bruce, as well as Dennis Hoey's Inspector LeStrade, all of whom deliver typically energetic performances.The setting is novel, though, with Holmes and Watson aboard a train bound from London to Edinburgh, acting as bodyguards for the ""Star of Rhodesia,"" a precious jewel whose owner is murdered.Of course, a train is the perfect setting for a mystery, but as ""Murder on the Orient Express"" would prove twenty-eight years later, the claustrophobic atmosphere severely limits the action. But with a brisk running time of only 60 minutes, ""Terror by Night"" never threatens to bore.Brian W. Fairbanks"
1,Elementary my dear Watson... this disc is awful,"If you love the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies like I do, then DO NOT BUY THIS DISC! The film print quality is very poor and the sound is very muddy. The DVD box falsely states a running time of 60 minutes -- but the running time of film they put on the dvd only runs 53 minutes! Do the math. The 7 minutes they cut out are key scenes!!...and the Index of scene selections doesn't even work. Holmes and Watson deserve better..."
3,Action On A Speeding Train,"I've seen very few of the Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes films, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I did enjoy this short film. Holmes and Watson have been hired to guard a famous jewel called the Star of Rhodesia, a diamond that has caused no end of problems for its many previous owners. Most of the film takes place aboard a speeding train bound for Scotland, a scenario ripe with possibilities, due to the confined space and lack of possible escape. Various characters are aboard, opening up many chances for robbery, and as it turns out, murder as well. Rathbone and Bruce are of course classics in this genre, and after so many turns as these characters, there performances seem effortless. The supporting cast is fine as well, and there is enough action to more than keep the viewer's attentions. It's obvious not much money was spent on the film, and the absence of music at key events is felt, but this mystery remains entertaining nonetheless."
4,"Not the best in the series, but good","A film that is in no way a masterpiece, but is in every way a blast to watch. From the great acting of Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, to the great location (a speeding trane), this film is a must for any fan of Sherlock Holmes."
4,Enjoyable mystery,"Holmes and Watson are on the job, along with a friend of Watson's, on a train from London to Scotland. They are to protect a huge diamond, which has already had one attempt at theft made upon it in London. It doesn't take long for murder and theft to strike the train journey. Holmes and Watson, along with Scotland Yard Inspector LeStrade, find a baffling mystery. The murder MUST be one of the passengers in the very car in which the murder occurred, but which one?Unfortunately, the ending is a bit simple for a Holmes mystery, and very little of the famous Holmes talent for putting small obscure clues together is evident in this story. Still, the mystery is enjoyable and surprising. Just the atmosphere of an early 20th century train trip makes this movie worth a watch, as virtually the entire movie is set on the train.Recommended."
5,Rathbone IS Sherlock!,"I just got this and a bunch of the other Basil Rathbone Sherlocks and watching them all over again makes me realize that Rathbone was not only the greatest Sherlock Holmes but was also the voice I would always hear in my head while reading the adventures as a teen-ager. I started with ""Terror By Night"" because of the title and while it is not as action packed as some of the other movies like ""Secret Weapon,"" it is still a really interesting mystery. Even when you know who the bad guy is, you still don't know exactly where the possibly-stolen Star of Rhodesia is as it switches hands so many times!I have read that this was tosssed off pretty quickly as a movie, but Rathbone can't help himself except be amazing in it."
5,9 year old and 10 month old can play together!,My 9 year old daughter and my 10 month old son had a ball with this. They laughed giggled and played for hours. It was nice to see them both enjoy the same activity together.
3,Okay but?,The tunnel itself is fine. There is no padding inside where the rings are. I do like the end panels that have see-through mesh. I think the price is to high for the quality of product.
3,Beware,"My 11 month old son likes this tunnel, however the coils every few inches are not padded and it gives him bruises! I know it's the tunnel because I'm small enough to crawl thru it and I could feel the hardness- I also had bruises later. Wish I hadn't thrown away the box or I'd go get my wasted [...] back. Otherwise it would be a fun toy."
3,Smaller than it looks,"I bought this for my kids remembering how fun it was when I was little. However, the picture makes it look so much bigger than it really is. My son can barely fit without feeling claustrophobic. I think they played with it once."
5,new wave of american/swedish melodic deathmetal. lol,"seriously. just like the guy below me said, and i can't believe there's only one review for these guys, this cd blew me away and by far and away blew away my expectations for this cd, didn't really know much of them, bought this cd on a whim. lucky me. right now this band is standing in the shadows of much bigger bands, such as arch enemy, soilwork, inflames, etc. i love melodic death metal and some of these big name bands should be watching for this band over there shoulders cuz if these guys keep putting awesome cd's out like this they'll the opening act for these guys.. not a bad song on the cd. If you liked this cd I suggest u check out Solar Dawn ""Equinoctium"" as well as Within Y ""Extened Mental Dimesions"" two other very very good melodic death metal bands that aren't to well know yet. enjoy."
5,Masterpiece,I heard this band a year ago on an underground cd and i was like this is a good band but i could never find out who they were but finally i did and im glad i did they kick @$$ they are a great death metal band i like their song Tales Of Bitterness very good song very melodic i hope to see some more cds from Enforsaken
5,Oh Hell Yes!!!...an American Melodic Death Metal Band,"Keep this short and sweet. These guys are awesome. Just heard the 1st 3 songs tonight from a friend and I was very much impressed. Definitely Melodic/Progressive Death Metal. If your a fan of Dark Tranquility, In Flames, Children of Bodom or any other Scandanavian Melodic Death Metal band, these guys fit right in. So spread the word: ENFORSAKEN"
5,Good software for Basic users,"If you are tired of iMovie and don't have the bottomless bit of money for Final Cut Pro, this is a good alternative. With a simple user interface, but an expansive feature list, it's a solid program, that is only enchanced by the incredible power of a mac. I would recommend this for any user regardless of their money or equipment situation."
4,Biography of a special man,"I Stand by the Door is a biography of Sam Shoemaker, written by his widow Helen. This is the book's main strength and its main weakness. Although I find that the main emphasis of clergy should be missionary outreach while Shoemaker saw the main emphasis as evangelis, both of these areas are important and I Stand by the Door makes a good case for the priority of evangelism.The main problem that I had with this book was that it bordered on hero worship. Sam Shoemaker did not seem to have any faults. Everything he did was purposeful and well executed. All of his efforts were successful. This may well be because it was written by his widow, but it did bother me while I was reading the book. But overall it was well worth reading and learning about an amazing man."
4,Great wetsuit but no goggles,"I'm not sure why they advertise the goggles... it must be outdated and they don't realize it. The wetsuit is great, but don't count on getting any goggles with it."
2,Disappointing remastering of historic recordings,"This 2001 Allegro/Classico D'Oro CD offers disappointing remasterings of Elgar's 1927 recording of his Second Symphony and his 1928 recording of his Cello Concerto (this with cello soloist Beatrice Harrison). My guess is that Allegro used secondary sources and applied excessive filtering, robbing the original 78 rpm sound of its immediacy and bite.For a better remastering of the 1927 recording of the symphony, try transfer engineer Mark Obert-Thorn's recent release on Naxos Historical (available from Amazon.com.uk). For the 1928 recording of the Cello Concerto, EMI's own remasterings are better than Allegro's."
1,ugh,"Yet again another boring book written with all the flair and emotional insight of the list of ingredients on the back of a shampoo bottle. I was not titilated or enlightened by this characters constant sexual confusion. I WAS IRRITATED AND DISGUSTED!!! When did V. C. Andrews turn into an after school special!?! I guess when she became a franchise! This is the only book of ""hers"" in the past 15 years that I have not purchased (HINT, HINT). Way back at End of the Rainbow I thought it couldn't get any worse. Sadly it has. I will not be purchasing any more of these books in the future."
5,great book,Andy Russell is a young boy who's life is full of troubles. His gerbils have escaped. He's having trouble paying attention in class. His best friend needs a place to stay while her parents are recovering from a car accident and he's sure his parents will say no! They just found out his mother is going to have a baby!What did you like or not like about the book?This is the first book in the Andy Russell series. Kids will enjoy this and look for the others that follow it.Would you recommend this book? Why or Why not?I would recommend this book. I feel that kids can relate to the characters in the book well.
3,Lots of trouble for Andy,"Good book for children just starting with chapter books. Everytime Andy turns around it seems that he is getting into trouble, whether its his fault or not. Kids will enjoy the pranks in the classroom and may get into the deeper character of Tanisha, who lives with Andy's family while her parents recover in a rehabilitation center from an accident.The only reason I didn't give it more stars was how the classroom was described and how the substitute teacher was written. She is new to teaching and walks in not knowing how to handle the class and gives them tasks that are outrageous for their age, yet it seems they complete all the tasks given to them and only complain."
2,Only a two Star Movie,"Now don't get me wrong, the fight sceens were great. But thats all the movie was. There was know sturcture to the story the movie was trying to tell. You would have had to major in Roman history to tell where it was going. I know this was not suppose to be a girly movie, but it could of had some drama to it. Plus their was no substance to it. It was just laid out on the table for the taking. But if you like to see worthless people getting murderd in a ring of tigers, this movie is for you."
2,Giant flaws,"Having seen this movie i must say that is was a waste of my time. The reason that i say this is that the history in this movie is messed up. I have had quite a few roman history classes this film has nothing to do with that. For those of you that want a good movie based upon acient rome this is not the movie. But if you have no idea what acient rome is about, their laws, or history, then you might like this movie."
1,"The worse movie since ""The English Patient.""",I just got to tell you that I was just bored to tears watching this long and stupid movie. This one doesn't earn the rights for an Academy Award :-(
2,"Hollywood,start reading history and fire the sound editor.","After much Hollywood hoopla in the media I decided to see this movie and I was disappointed at the typical way Hollywood drops the ball. Now if I spent a few million bucks on making a movie I would check some facts like,the Romans did not speak Italian, Latin was the spoken language and did anyone catch the sound byte at the start of the film, the big battle the inhabitants of Germainia war chant was taken right from the movie Zulu with Michael Caine.Now what was wrong with the'German'actors chanting for themselves,what not enough SAG cards to go around.Now the rest of the movie was well worth watching but I would not buy it on DVD or VHS it is barely is rentable,a real shame too because there is some excellent acting, notable was Oliver Reed.Better luck next time Hollywood."
4,Very entertaining..just don't expect Braveheart,"This was a really entertaining film, though it begins a tad slowly. All of the acting was fantastic and despite the heavy violence, it wasn't exactly gorey. Don't expect chills or tears at the end, it's not that ""epic""....just really good fun."
3,"Love Amazon, hate U.S. Mail and UPS","Product game quick and at a great price. But the DVD box was banged up and a piece of plastic was chipped off of the inside case. Since I've never had issues with Amazon, (3rd party sellers excluded) I'll blame it on the mail system. Would have complained about it to Amazon, except the dvd's were fine. Thanks Amazon!!!"
3,Good movie but no comparison to BRAVEHEART,"Good movie. Good fight scene but short and also changes angle so much that you really can't enjoy the fight scene. Second, the female characters in Braveheart is a class above the lame duck(s) in Gladiator. Why would an empeoror even want to bed his average looking sister when there's so many knockouts in Rome?"
2,Too much compression in one DVD,"I know it's a great movie and everyone loves it. However, I was VERY disappointed with the quality of the DVD.2 and a half hour movie is too small for one DVD. They compressed the movie too much into one DVD and the screen was very jerky when i played the movie.I hope they will release a new edition with double-side DVD."
5,Just what I was hoping for,"The Blue-ray is exactly what I was hoping for. I have always wanted to purchase the movie in this format, but prices were a bit steep at the local electronics store, like BEST BUY. I found this blue-ray at a reasonable price and ordering was also another pleasing experience.Thanks.Jerry"
1,The Phoenix Almost Rises,"I wrote a much longer and more detailed of this film once, but They wouldn't print it so I'll just give you the basic conclusion: Joaquin Phoenix's EYES have more life than this entire dreadful film.Absolutely the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzz!,"What a snooze-fest. Terribly over-rated. There's so much talk, talk, so many long, long shots of facial expressions that you want to scream: okay, let's have some action! Even the action sequences are akwardly handled. Russell crowe is terrif but Ridley Scott could have borrowed some of the fun from the Steve Reeves muscle epics. This flick takes forever to get started. 'Scuse me while I watch ""Hercules"" starring the incomparable--and vastly more watchable Steve Reeves."
2,Boring and So Predictable,I don't know what all the hype is about. This movie was barely worth the rental fee that I paid. I would wait until it's on TV personally. I don't really think that Juaquin Phoenix should be acting and I don't think that Russell Crowe is all that fancy either. I would have enjoyed the movie more if they had both been eaten by lions.
3,"Great commentaries by Scott, editor, cinematographer","Ridley Scott dominates the commentary track, which also features the editor and the cinematographer, offering insights into not only how scenes were shot but how the script developed and how the second act was expanded from the original draft. He also mentions Hans Zimmer's score quite often, which he was pleased with, and how it augmented intimate scenes and played a role to the extent of becoming ""another character in the film"". Zimmer has his own documentary on the second disc, too. Like Wolfgang Peterson, Scott is a fascinating listen when it comes to balancing talk of his approach to directing while sharing production anecdotes from the field. Listen for the inside joke about the two horses on Maximus' breastplate device!"
2,Don't bother,"I saw this movie when it came out and it was good at the beginning and the tiger arena was cool; but then it dragged ALOT. Also the director wasn't being reasonable, 'cause what are the odds that a roman emperor would fight a gladiator in an arena. Plus wouldn't the emperor's courtiers realise that he was a phycopath. And he is because HE KILLED HIS FATHER. ..."
5,What you expect,It's exactly what you expect to see in a movie.Great shots-beautiful landscapes-action-drama-the fall and rise of a hero-great battles.
5,"set aside ""reality"" and you can enjoy it","I happen to be an ancient historian and I find that I can best enjoy movies and films set in the ancient world if I don't expect them to be realistic. There are many problems with this film in terms of the reality of the Roman world during the second century CE -- listing them would use up the entire word limit for reviews on Amazon.com. However, the film itself moves rapidly, the scenery and costuming is eleborate, and the characters are interesting and well-acted. Its good to see both veteran actors and younger ones interacting so well. My only real complaint is that some of the filming made me a bit dizzy but then combat is a fast-paced and terrifying experience and the quick, spiraling movements did a good job of making me feel overwhelmed at times. We're using it in the Roman History class this semester and it should generate a lot of good discussion."
5,Another Skeptic with a 5 Star Review,"I didn't want to like Gladiator in the worst way. I hate Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe but almost immediately after the first battle sequence, I knew that Gladiator was something special. The action sequences are top-notch and rival Braveheart. The best fighting sequence is the first in the Roman Coliseum where Crowe and his horde of slaves turn the tables on their opponents. The only other time I've ever been so pumped up after a movie was Die Hard. The adrenaline rush is great in Gladiator and eventhough I hate to admit it, Russell Crowe does an outstanding job as Maximus. The film is long (over 2 hrs) but it flies by (the sure sign of a great movie) and it leaves you wanting more. This is one of the only commercial films that I can truly say deserved the Oscar for best picture. This is a definate must own for your DVD library. Highly Recommended."
5,One fantastic movie,"This is definetly one everyone will be talking about in years to come! The story takes place in Ancient Rome, around 180 A.D., when chariots were still racing, and the Empire was still common. Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) is dying and he has to pick who will be the new Emporer after he dies. So when he comes to the decision to make General Maximus (Russell Crowe) the new Emporer, his awful son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) gets jealous because he thinks he's more worthy than Maximus, so Commodus seeks revenge, in the most evil, horrible way you can imagine. And that's just the beginning! Even though this is by far my favorite movie, I must admit that there is A LOT of bloodshed, so if you have children and you don't want them exposed to this kind of violence, I recommend that you make them steer clear of this one. Yet, this would be a good history lesson, because that's how it was back then!"
5,An Excellent Movie--You must own this!,"This movie is about a general in the Roman army who, because he is the favorite with the Ceasar, is targeted by the Ceasars son after the Ceasars death. He returns to his home to find it destroyed and his family dead. He is captured by a slaver who specializes in Gladiator fighting and Crowe (Maximus) becomes a Gladiator who eventually comes face to face with his enemy....This is a great movie that I think you will enjoy and I absolutely love the costumes."
5,"""Are You Not Entertained?""","Gladiator has to be one of the best movies in a long time. The acting was fantastic. I particularly enjoyed New Zealander Russell Crowe in the role of Maximus, Connie Nielson as Lucilla, and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. The story was fast paced, gripping and moving, and the portrayal of the Roman Empire and its people was magnificent. The gladiatorial scenes were stunningly realistic, although extremely gory and shocking.This movie fully deserved the Oscars it won. Anyone 13 and over will most definately be entertained."
5,Stunning and Riveting!,This movie was one of the best I have ever seen. The detail is tremendous and the story line fantastic. It is a story of tradgedy and couragouesness(spelling). All ages will love this movie except for young children. This movie comes highly recommended. Enjoy watching it!
4,Too much extra content,"The movie's fantastic, but the DVD has far too much extra content... 4 hours of extra material for a 2 hour movie? I really wouldn't care if they had a movie-only version of it, but to charge so much (SRP) for Gladiator on DVD and then justifying it with all this added garbage (I'm sorry, but much of the extra material is just that) is frustrating."
3,Braveheart goes to Rome,"I received this movie as a present having never seen it in the theatre. I'm both disappointed and glad that I didn't spend the money. Essentially it's the same kind of plot as Braveheart, but set in the Roman Empire. While it is visually and musically stunning, the movie is extremely brutal. It's major flaw was the weakness of the plot and the lack of character development of some of the players, despite some great acting. It's worth renting, particularly if you have a really large screen tv, but I don't think that your collection will be lacking if you leave this off of your buy list. If it does well in the Oscar hunt, it will only serve to prove the weakness of this year's collection of movies."
5,Gladiator Stands Alone,"Of any movie I have seen, this movie makes you root for the good guy and hope the bad guy bites it more than any other movie. The dipiction of the Roman Empire at that time is exquisite and nowhere else will you see a combination of action and diologue that fit the bill."
5,So much for the glory of Rome,"A well balanced blend of drama and action, Gladiator follows the rise and fall of two great men. Maximus (Russel Crowe) delivers a mind imprinting performance as he goes from General of the Northern armies to becoming a slave. Forced into becoming a gladiator, he slowly climbs back to the top. With many road bumps along the way, we see a man fight for love, honor, and respect. Amazing sequences, artistically sound in it's delivery, and some kick butt gladiator fighting that'll have you screaming ""thumbs down"" to the new Ceasar."
5,Wonderful film,I love Sword and Sandal films and this is probably my favorite. It was entirely perfect. There isnt a single moment in the film that I would change. It has the perfect amount of action and suspense and its very dramatic and moving. Ridley Scott is a genius.
1,Classic movie - defective release,"The version about to be released on 2009-09-01 is defective. Picture quality is from the 2000 DVD master. I would advise waiting until an updated release is made available, don't let them make you pay twice!!"
1,AVOID this BD Release of Gladiator!,"The picture is extremely shoddy in this Blu-Ray release! Avoid like the plague, so the studio gets the idea! What the heck is the studio doing releasing this atrocious transfer on BD when the movie itself is such a great one? Unbelievable! A movie like this should have a flawless transfer! Argh!"
2,A missed opportunity,"Gladiator was one of the most anticipated titles on Blu-ray, but this release comes from an old master (used for the DVD in 2000) and suffers from too much DNR (digital noise reduction, which smudges detail) and edge enhancement (outlines around edges). In fact, there are details present on the DVD that are missing from the Blu-ray. On the other hand, Braveheart (released on Blu-ray on the same day) has a fantastic picture and makes Gladiator look even worse. The best thing to do is to pick up Braveheart (if you like the movie, of course) and wait for the eventual re-release of Gladiator."
5,BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR..........FOR SURE!,"Gladiator is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in a very long time. It is the kind of movie you don't expect it to be soossoso good, but when you finally are watching it you experience every emotion there is for you to experience in a movie(tension, sadness, happiness and fear). Although it does contain some bloody and intense scenes of war, it gives a message of life that is too special to miss it. How love can conquer all and remain in ones mind forever. Gladiator is a movie that, especially in my experience, the viewer feels like it's living the story. Russell Crowe does a fanstastic job in this movie and well deserves the Best Actor Oscar. I hope Gladiator wins the Best Movie!!! HIGHLY recommended"
5,This movie is GROOVY!,This movie ROCKS! Very realistic! Would be good without graphic violence (not that I don't like mind it)! You gotta see this movie!
4,Dedicated to a higher cause,"This film is a magnificent performance by one of the most intense actors on the screen today. Russell Crowe easily solidifies his name as one of the top actors of the day. The film is grand and Ridley Scott has definitely created a masterpiece in the same vein as Braveheart, El Cid, or Ben-Hur. Joaquin Phoenix is incredible as Commodus, and shows a strong range of acting ability. Russell Crowe's character who is seeking only peace, must walk through a fire of life in order to gain it. Crowe portrays a Roman Soldier and gladiator with a sense of honor that one would find in a Marine. Crowe never loses faith in his purpose to do what he must do, and he honors his word, his family, and the former emperor Marcus Aurelius (Oliver Reed)in the film. Dijon Honshu (Amistad) plays a good friend and confidant to Maximus. It is truly a marvelous movie, and a masterpiece of a film. It is a great story from an incredible and epic time."
5,Unbelievable!,"This movie is just unbelievable. I remember watching it the weekend it came out on the bigscreen and i was astounished at what i have seen. Gladiator stars Russel Crowe who plays the role of Maximus. Gladiator is an epic that never dissapoints. With the score by good ole Hans, and Ridley Scott directs. Great Film. Highly enjoyable!"
5,Great Movie,It is nice to have this movie on my Kindle...easily portable. I would highly recommend it for your Kindle. I like having it wherever I go.
3,Great movie; poor transfer,"I bought this specifically because it is one of my favorites, and I wanted the Blu-ray version for a higher quality video image. Unfortunately, the quality of the image was very disappointing, as it is no better than the DVD version."
2,Hardly the Best,"Okay, no. This is not the ""greatest movie ever made"", nor is it anywhere up there with a ""movie of the year!"" This was an average movie plagued with clichés and themes already covered by better films.I loved the first battle scene. It was beautiful, despite the death and destruction taking place. However, once that scene is over, the movie takes a steady nose-dive through the rest of the film. From the death of his wife, the gladiator imprisonment and ""Spartacus-esque"" training sequences, the villains idiotic decision that taking on the most successful gladiator in Rome could be a good idea (not to mention he's got the jones for his sister), right down to the ""I've seen that so many times before!"" ending, there wasn't really an original idea in the whole picture. Top that off with what literally looks like dirt and dust the director forgot to wash off the film reel, and you get a ho-hum movie that's probably only worth watching for the fight scenes."
4,"Blu-ray Is Worth Renting, Not Owning","Just watched this last night on a 50"" Panasonic plasma. The reviews are correct, it's a 3-star blu-ray of a 5-star movie. It looks the worst in the action sequences, and the best in the close-ups when the actors face the camera and try to cry as intensely as possible to win their oscars.To me, it never looked worse than a dvd. It always looked better. And the flawed transfer never stopped me from enjoying the story. I haven't seen the movie for several years. And I enjoyed renting it.I don't know if they will ever re-release a better blu-ray of this movie. And I really don't care that much. But I can respect the people who care enough complain and boycott just for the principal of the thing.If you want to watch Gladiator on blu-ray, you can rent it 20 times for the cost of owning it.Braveheart, on the other hand, is absolutely one of the best blu-rays I've ever seen, and worth collecting if you're a collector or cinematic awesomeness."
5,An amazing film,"Brilliant film. Well written (apart from some of the historical error's, but it is hollywood), well acted and brilliant effects. The story really gets you involved and makes you associate with the characters. Dispite a few minor error's in the history the rest is very accute (eg the brutalness and the slave trade) and makes you want to know more about Roman History and makes history enjoyable. You will enjoy every moment of this and go through every emotion.It is an amazing film a must buy."
1,Upscaled DVD is better!,"I don't have to say it, since everyone knows, but just wanted to add my thoughts to this release. Paramount needs to give those of us who purchased this a free trade-in for the re-release that's supposedly coming out that fixes this quality control problem. On cable and satellite, the broadcast version is actually the way it's supposed to look, it's true 1080p as opposed to this upscaled DVD-looking mess. I'm sorry for all of us, and very disappointed. :( Get with the program, Paramount!"
1,Extremly Poor Quality Transfer,"This Review is for the Blu-Ray Quality Transfer: I would imagine the guy responsable for the quality control on this project no longer has a job . Trust me out of my 400 Blu-Ray Titles I have bought this is running at 2nd from the bottom,I love this movie but I could not bear to watch it on my 20K HT ,was like watching TV with bad reception. Exstremly disapointing"
5,One Of The Best Movies Ever Made!,"A riveting,thought-provoking masterwork with intense,harrowing,awesome battle scenes both on the field and the coliseum;Oscar-worthy performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix;and brillant direction by Ridley Scott.If you don't have this sure-to-be-Best Picture,GET IT NOW!"
3,"Despite Spectacle, Gladiator is NOT for Everyone.","I very much enjoyed the visual mastery of this film. Scott's direction, as always, is top-notch. Cinematography, art direction, costumes . . . everything visual about this film is dead-on. Unfortunately the movie too often slips into passages of such extremely grotesque violence that my enjoyment of the film was diminished. Also distracting is a storyline which lacks depth and originality.This is not a bad film by any means. It is certainly an accurate depiction of what life may have been like for a Roman Gladiator. I'm just not sure it's something I needed to see in such gory detail.The true gem in this film, along with superior visuals, is the amazing performance of Joaquin Phoenix."
2,"""Epic masterpiece?"" What the hell?!","Boring plot is more akin to watching WWF wrestling than a ""masterpiece."" Boring characters, crappy special effects, ugly atmosphere, and pretentious acting don't make a great movie. Why is this movie receiving so much praise? I have no idea."
3,Techincal problem in this DVD?,"I noticed my Dolby Digital (or DTS) processor indicated that the subwoofer channel signal is there when I'm playing this movie, but the subwoofer is not projecting any of the low frequency rumbles at all. I tried this with DTS as well as Digital Dolby and both behaved the same way. All of my other DVDs behaved fine and subwoofer rumbled fine.Anyone out there experiencing this problem with this particular DVD? Check it out, put your ear next to the sub while while they are fighting at the first few scenes. The sub is totally silent."
1,Awful trash,"Dont buy this garbage. The plot is wire thin, the acting is sub par at it's best moments, the directing is shoddy and the action scenes give the film gore, not merit. very very stupid. the fact that this was even nominated for academy awards makes me extremely angry, and the fact that this thing won awards, and Almost Famous, the true movie of 2001, which had acting and a plot, isn't even nominated INFURIATES me."
1,Regional settings,This product did not mention that it does not work in some regions.I did not think that there may be PAL / NTSC blu-ray versions and this one appears to be NTSC..I will be searching for a regional fix to this..
5,A ROUSING GOOD EPIC ADVENTUR,When I first heard about this movie I became intrigued. Would the director do justice to the period? Wow!! He sure did. Would the actors do the job required to make the period come to life for us viewers? Mr. Crowe et.al. have surpassed my wildest dreams. As a student of ancient history I found very little to fault this movie on. The Carthage battle had female gladiators in it and that wouldn't have occured in Ancient Rome. Women never fought men. The second DVD is as good as the movie. The different subjects are very helpful to the novice. Since purchasing this DVD I have searched for earlier films with Russell Crowe. His earlier films are delightful and quirky. They won't let you down. All of the actors in this movie did outstanding work. This movie is definitely one you will watch over and over again.
1,Ridley Scott selfishly deleted his girlfriend's scenes,"You see less of Gianina Facio in this DVD than in theatre. Railly Scott selfishly deleted his girlfriend's scenes. The horribly murdered wife and son were an ever-lasting wound in the Roman general's mind. Now Facio's scenes were cut, you can hardly see the drives in Maximus' revenge."
1,One of the worst movies ever made,I am astounded by the rave reviews I read of this film. I am flabbergasted that it has been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar. My only explanation is that people who like this movie have never seen one before - yes I mean have never seen any other moving picture or television. Cliche after cliche - horrible acting - every scene stolen from another film or 19th century painting - every storyline stolen from every salacious thing you ever read about Roman History. A travesty. I can not say enough bad things about this movie.
3,RATHER WATCH THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL !,THE FIGHTING IS COOL DON'T GET ME WRONG BUT IT WAS JUST DO DAM BORING FOR ME.
3,This is no Braveheart.,"This was an entertaining movie but during the gladiator battles it was like watching the Blair Witch Project...very dizzing. The camera would swing back and forth making it impossible to see what was going on. The story was good and cast of characters were put together well. But I cant help but think the makers of this film were trying to give the viewer the same feel and intensity as Braveheart, which to me will go down as the best epic movie ever. This film is good, but it is no Braveheart."
5,Rip-roaring Hollywood spectacle,"Stunning production values, a stirring score by Hans Zimmer, and exemplary performances by Russell Crowe and the always terrific Joaquin Phoenix make this film - one of 2000's biggest blockbusters - a must-have for any serious DVD collector. Hollywood doesn't get much better than this. The opening battle scene alone is worth the price of admission.The bonus disc includes a sequence of scenes left on the cutting room floor with Ridley Scott's commentary and a montage of deleted scenes set to Hans Zimmer's score specially edited for this DVD."
4,Got A Problem Mate!!!,"Yes the tough man of Hollywood is shown in all his glory, playing the part of a fallen Roman general ""Maximus"" who seeks revenge on the man who killed his wife and child.Sold into slavery and brought by none other than the man of all bar room fights, Oliver Reed, Maximus becomes a Gladiator and soon plots his advesarys downfall.A real blood and guts movie not for family viewing.As a two disc set, this package has absolutly everything you need to know about the making of this film and the history of the Gladiator. It is such a shame that a big deal was make over the constant bloopers that showed up in the final cut, bcause you can now see them. Thats why I have given it four stars instead of five."
2,More blood than bravado,"All the awards this film garnered didn't quite make sense to me after viewing ""Gladiator"" on DVD on a recent overseas flight. The evil is banal, the hero is too stoic, and the special effects overwhelm the plot. Although Scott spent lots of money on exotic locations and spectacular stunts, a deft screenwriter would have been a welcome addition."
1,Blu-Ray quality TERRIBLE. Movie: A legend,"This movie is so over-sharpened it's painful to watch. I've had to tone-down sharpness on my 60"" 1080p Plasma all the way down in order to make this movie somewhat presentable. Whoever at the studio decided to run these sorts of filters for the Blu-Ray transfer should be looking for another job."
5,Best movie to see.,"Most people have underrated this movie and they are entitled to their opinion. But they must now or never pull the blindfold from their eyes and see the truth and majesty in this movie. ""It seemed to be moving at 2 miles per hour."" Tsk tsk tsk. If you dont listen to the teacher you dont learn anything. I would recomend this movie to anyone who has an imagination and really likes to watch movies with spectacular special effects. It is full of romance, war, and revenge. ""What we do in life, echoes in eternity."" I wish there were only more stars i could award this movie."
2,Not so good,"I know I'm not gonna find anyone to agree with me when I say I didn't like this movie. It was just too . . . formulaic.The villain was the same type of villain we've seen in all the movies--dirty, rotten, stupid , yada yada. Then there's the female role who's all nice and we all have to like her. Then there's the kid who's just annoying.The only good thing is Russell Crowe, the special effects, and stunning overall look of this movie. I hated the cheesy moments--the dream sequences didn't work. I don't know why anyone would cry at this movie. You have to be a real softie to.Great-looking, but nothing new in the story."
2,Extended or waste of cash?,"This Extended Edition is getting 2 stars for the following reasons; cool box, new stuff. However, it fails on the one fact that it is NOT in DTS!!!! The Signature DVD was DTS which came out about 3/4 years ago, why on earth would they re-release Gladiator (for the 4th time) without including the DTS soundtrack. My advice would be to but the signature series if your gonna buy Gladiator, unless you dont want the amazing sound to go with your cool movie.PS. I cant stand when movies are re-released over and over again (Donnie Darko, Army of Darkness, Mallrats,Gladiator.....)Will ther ever be a 'final edition'?"
5,Blu-ray edition of gladiator,Don't let all the bad reviews make up your mind for you. Watch it and make your own decision. I was hesitant to get this on blu-ray because of the negative reviews for it. I don't see what every one is talking about. This looks very good on blu-ray the picture quality is awesome .(after you get past the title sequence)
5,Hail to Ridley Scott! A Must Have DVD.,"Director Ridley Scott triumphs again in this modern EPIC. I need not put more into this review than to simply say this is a great film. From the openning battle in Germania to the final dual between Maximus(Crowe) and Commodus(Phoenix) in the Coliseum, this movie is an audio and visual feast on a grand scale.Like James Cameron, Steven Spielberg, and Wolfgang Peterson, Ridley Scott ranks as one of my favorite directors because these gentlemen all make high quality films. They are all visionaries who are masters of using modern visual effects to tell stories which have timeless themes. Gladiator is a perfect example.Other Ridley Scott films I recommend: ALIEN, Blade Runner, Black Rain."
2,"""Best Picture""??? Please....","This is a perfect example of how Hollywood politics often influence the Academy Awards. Because despite the enormous marketing muscle behind it, this film is essentially a B movie with grade A special effects. The acting is okay and the story is alright. But come on. This has to be the longest film ever made that contains no character development whatsoever. In a nutshell, after spending gobs of money producing it, the studio executives commanded that this movie win the big award. And ""the people"" obeyed."
5,Excellence,"A superb and convincing acting job by Russel Crowe, well detailed and executed action sequences along with a strong plot and story created an emotional movie succeding that of Titanic and Armageddon combined helped produce the correct recipe for the best movie of the year. A great movie to see whether it is your 4th time or first. (Important note: If you have not seen gladiator yet, GO SEE IT A.S.A.P.)"
5,Always a classic,Loved it when it came out and it only gets better every time I see it. Only regret was not paying more for HD.
3,Manly movie,My husband loved it. Fast moving. Violence as expected but in all the necessary places. Even has some historical references.
4,History isn't What it Used to Be,"As history, this movie is a total loss; as a story it tends to be simplistic and sappy. Basically, this is an action movie, with lots of spectacle and the plot is mostly an excuse to move to the next battle. As spectacle and action, it's fabulous."
3,Best picture??? Excuse me,"When I first saw this movie, I thought it was pretty good. Then I saw Braveheart and realized that Gladiator didn't have one original bone in its body. The one-liners are extremely corny, the storyline is nothing new, and there is noooo way that it deserved best picture. Despite the extent to which it was overrated, it is still a very cool movie. Cool - no more - no less."
5,Beautiful & gory glimpse of the Roman Empire,"INFO:Played on N. American, Region A/1 PS3. Bough new sealed.THE GOOD:+Elegant looking steelbook. Maximus is gloss on the cover and background is matte finish.+Disc lets you choose your language when you first insert into player.+Extended cut included! (Deleted scenes)+2 disc set.IN THE MIX:+/-German print.+/-Internal case artwork.THE BAD:-Bottom left ""16"" sticker painted on case.-Top blu-ray tag painted on case.VERDICT:Amazing movie to watch in HD! A blu-ray must have."
4,GENERAL + SLAVE + GLADIATOR = HERO?,"A great Hollywood Production, it has action, entertainment and drama and comes with 2 discs, the first is the film, the second is behind the scenes , trailers, directors cut`s and a lot of extra goodies. The movie itself is worth buying and even if American films doesn`t entertain me annymore, this is one American film i can think of watching again. The story is quite good and the battle choreography is very nice.Had more American films been like the Gladiator, I would watch them all. Good entertainment for the money, really, who doesn`t love swordfights?Great movie, but not excellent, thats why I gave it 4 Stars."
1,Barely Palatable,"I believe this is one of the top 10 over-hyped films in recent years--enough hype to garnish a Best Picture from the self-lauding Acedamy. In all of the two hours of so-called ""honor"" ""courage"" and ""loyalty,"" all I seem to get is bad acting, a contrived story, and fast-moving scenes. It reminds me of eating a large vat of buttered popcorn, a big box of jujubees washed down with a 64 oz. soda--fills you up, but no nutrition."
1,Widescreen???,"I haven't seen this movie yet because I wanted buy it and watch it. Am I the only person out there that doen't like the WIDESCREEN format? You can get the standard format on VHS and on some DVD's. If you check all the new releases, they only come in Widescreen. Why is that?"
2,ummm........,personally i think it's boring. but i gave it 2 stars anywayzzz. cuz some parts of it was actually pretty awesome. but i was just kinda half asleep when i was watchin' it.
2,Sloooooooooooooooooow,"Am I the only one who found this movie to be VERY slow and much too long? People talk about ""Gladiator"" like it's some slam bang action picture. The trailer sure made it look like one, yet everything in the trailer came from the last third of the film. Every scene in the first half of the movie is so protracted I had to stop myself from yelling, ""GET HIM IN THE COLISEUM ALREADY!"" The film is well structured and a good story but there's not enough meat on this bone for a film well over two hours. And so it feels s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d with pretty visuals, pretension and unnecessary talk-talk-talk. If we could get a 90 minute cut of this on the DVD set, I'd buy and treasure it. Until then, I'll keep watching ""Braveheart."""
1,Gladiator BD,Has anyone noticed the audio is only DTSnot DTS HD MA as one was led to believe.This blu ray audio is worse than both theoriginal 5.1 and the subsequent 6.1 from thelater release.
2,Potential unrealized,"Knowing that the movie would be (basically) historically inaccurate, I went expecting to like it anyway. However, despite some excellent performances, the movie is too long and doesn't really realize it's potential. My biggest complaint was the very obvious transitions between live action and computer animation - something that shouldn't occur with the techniques available today. Russell Crowe's performance is the saving grace of the movie, but I can't recommend it to anyone interested in historical fact or riveting drama."
3,Hypus Maximus,"A blockbuster or epic? Perhaps because of its action and violence this picture appeals to the young theatre demographic. There is a lesson somewhere within the story...amidst sword stabs and flying severed heads...that power invested in one is never judiciously applied...or, maybe the lesson was ""run like heck"" if a tiger chases you.This DVD features a whole platter of additional features enhancing this reasonably entertaining film. Just okay."
3,NOTHING like Spartacus,"I like Ridley Scott and was expecting this to be a well made movie with an interesting story, but was sadly disappointed. The acting was poor and the story and characters were uninteresting. It's nowhere near as good as the epic movie Spartacus. Spartacus had great actors, relevant political themes and had several powerful philosophical ideals running through the story. I loved the scene where Spartacus and the man he was going to fight to death in the arena were sitting together while 2 other gladiators fought outside their holding pen. No dialogue and none was necessary, but you could really sense the fear and tension the 2 characters were feeling.This Gladiator movie was okay, but not worth buying. It's not something I'll likely watch a second time. It just isn't very interesting and the acting doesn't seem that sincere either."
5,Historical drama not to be missed,"Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) names popular general Maximus (Russel Crowe)as his heir , thus inciting the jealousy of the Emperor's worthless son , Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).Commodus murders the Emperor , and tries to have Maximus killed , before having Maximus' family murdered. Maximus is then enslaved , and eventually becomes Rome's most popular and undefeated gladiator.Russel Crowe gives a sterling performance as Maximus , and Joaquin Phoenix skilfully plays the evil Commodus.Connie Nielsen plays the Commidus' beautiful sister Lucillus.Panoramic historical imagery and rivetting action scenes , together with an involved plot and intrigue make this a historical drama not to be missed."
2,Entertaining Fiction,"Why use the names of real people if you are not going to follow real hisorical data? This movie is mostly fiction, it would have not hurt the story to stop pretending that it was non-fiction. Movies like this just confuse the ""popular"" uneducated public. I did appreciate some of the references though, for example when some ideals from ""Meditations"" were talked about before the emperor was murdered."
1,Terrible Picture,"As other reviewers explain technically, the picture quality on this release is horrendous for bluray. Do not buy."
2,Has some promise but just boring!,After I read the reviews I was expecting action and tons of it or a little gore. Now im not going to lie there are some great parts but very few. In my opinion this movie was just basically boring but if you like long droning conversations and drama where it shouldn't be then this is a must see!
3,"Crowe is good,but too violent for me","Way too gruesome for me. Other people might like it better,(guys probably) Crowe I felt sorry for after seeing to what happened to his wife and son. And I'm glad someone finally killed Commodious what a lech and general nasty slime"
3,Good until a typical ending,"I am a big fan of anything dreamworks does, and I thought that this was a good movie for the most part. this was the best movie that I have seen Crowe in, next to maybe Mystery, Alaska. I thought thta Joaquin Phoenix was an exceptional villian. The only thing that makes me give it 3 stars is two things, this movie was somewhat predictable, and the ending. This has been a ending that has been used in most of the big films in the past little while. Braveheart, Sabing Private Ryan, as well as the Crow have used the same, or similiar endings. I personally feel that it is a little old. Other than that it was a good movie."
2,L A M E ! ! !,"I can't decide if this is more of a rip-off of SPARTACUS or BRAVEHEART.With all the hoopla made over this film I was VERY DISAPPOINTED. The acting is one dimensional, the story is not original (but drawn out and plain boring) and when you watch this film see if you really care about Crowes character. The answer will be NO.I gave it 2 stars because it was mildly entertaining. However NOT oscarworthy!!!Do yourself a favor. For the real story see SPARTACUS instead. Or if you want some real acting look for Paul Newman."
3,Am I Actually Watching Braveheart?,"I actually liked Gladiator quite a bit, but I had one major problem with it, and that was that every time Russel Crowe looked up, I expected him to be Mel Gibson. I also found myself quoting Braveheart in almost every scene. I think the writers were at least as fond as Braveheart as I am, and they weren't able to break out of that mold. So my main problem was that it wasn't original enough."
2,just a good rental,"Hyped up too much and is extremely boring, but i have to admit the fighting are pretty cool but not enough to buy it...... maybe rent"
5,Le meilleur film de l'année,"J'ai été voir ce film sans aucune attente et je n'ai pas été deu. Une pure merveille, autant du realisateur que des acteurs. Russell Crowe démontre qu'il n'est pas le premier venue et que ce role lui va a merveille. Je l'ai vue 2 fois et s'il etais encore au cinéma j'y retournerais. Un délice pour tous."
1,Terrible Blu-Ray format -don't buy it!,"For the Gladiator Blu-Ray Sapphire Series - got this unknowingly at the store, thinking it would be a vast improvement over my regular DVD and what a HUGE disappointment it was! I'm getting rid of it immediately - smudging was unbelieveably bad and quality overall was terrible. I can't believe anyone would release this as is and think it was a good idea. Thankfully I got on sale, wish I had checked though beforehand. Anyone who loves this movie definitely should stick with their regular DVD format until a better blu-ray comes along. Totally disgusted with this version!"
5,"Best Movie in a Decade, but why isn't it on Bluray?!?!?","OK, heres the deal, when a negative review has this statement in it, ""Commodus was badly depicted, Roman annals usually depict him as"" you know it isn't a ""Movie"" review, but rather some wanna be historian that wanted to watch a documentary.Taking this film for what it is, A MOVIE!!!!!, it is near perfection.Characters have to be created in a movie to inspire reactions by the viewer. It isn't a documentary, nor has it EVER intended to be.Now, on a personal note, we need to get this thing released on Blu Ray ASAP."
2,Disappointing film from Ridley Scott,"I was very disappointed in this film from Scott. I have liked most of his films. I didn't think the action scenes were that impressive. The first battle, you couldn't see what was going on in it. Russell Crowe's character was never really challenged throughout the film. I did think Crowe did a good job in the film. It was to expected after standout performances in LA Confidential and The Insider. The story just did not draw me in. Everything looked too easy for Crowe's character (I know I am repeating myself here). It is just disheartening when a good director and a good actor get together and they make a mediocre film. A similar film is Braveheart. Braveheart is a much better film than this. That film thrust you into the battle scenes and made you care about William Wallace. That film had heart, while this film seemed cold and distant. I am sure Scott and Crowe will bounce back with their next projects."
1,disappointed,Ordered this item before Christmas with enough time to ship. Got a notice it would ship after Christmas. Never got the item.
2,Crude,"I am amazed by the number of people who seem to think that Gladiator is a great movie. I was extremely disappointed. Is everyone blind to the plot? It is so simple-minded and crude. I have seen better cartoons. Certainly, a couple of action-sequences are interesting -- but is that all you expect from a movie? And the ending is corny. And now some people are actually hopeful that this movie will get an Oscar for Best Picture. How sickening! But then these are the same people who gave Titanic two dozen Oscars. I say don't waste your time or money: get a movie by the Japanese directory Akira Kurosawa if you are interested in similar themes."
3,Not a Best Picture Oscar in my book!,"The year 2000 has to be considered one of the worst movie years in recent memory. As far as I'm concerned, none of the films nominated for Best Picture should have won, let alone nominated. Which brings me to Gladiator, the best picture winner of that year. This is probably the worst movie to win Best Picture since 1947 with Gentleman's Agreement. Don't get me wrong. The film is exciting with its chariots scenes and fights. Russell Crowe given the lack of competition probably deserved his Best Actor. Joaquin Phoenix is certainly effective in his supporting role. It's just that this film has been done before. If you like exciting, action packed film, this is for you. If you want to see a real Best Picture winner, try the original Ben Hur."
2,One of the worst movies I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie was completely boring all the way through until the big fight scene(which is the only reason this gets two stars).
4,Looks Fine,"Theres no grain visible in the blu-ray version, but who cares, grain makes HD look like low quality SD. I want a sharp wow factor, not technically accurate film reproduction (in terms of grain, color and blacks = more important). Watched this on: Pioneer BDP-51FD Blu-ray player > Pioneer Elite SC-07 Receiver > Pioneer Kuro PDP-6020FD. This looks great unless you want grain, you cant notice any enhanced edges or smudging. Wish I hadnt read all the reviews since it made me look for it during the movie. Extended version of the movie is not worth watching, far too long and adds nothing interesting, mostly dialog with the emperor. One scene of more arrows compared to theatrical."
1,Will never be released,"Paramount is now releasing only on HD DVD, therefore this release will never be available. Get the HD DVD Version if you wan't Gladiator in High Definition."
3,Brave Heart Style......,"This Movie is really well filmed the costume's and the Scenery looks authentic to the time of the Roman Empire. The Fighting is Really well Done. The Battle tactics They us at the Start of the Movie against the Germanic Tribe looks like an actual startegy they would use at that time and the acting was convincing. All of this is really impressive, But When you will see this movie you will think imediatly of Brave Heart, without breaking the story to others, similar events in the main characters life happen. Which you will find decieving. They should of added different twists, and fixed the plot to be Different. Then Everyone would of Enjoyed it Much More! The Movie was also too long, they should of made it a little shorter but it's just a tiny detail no big deal. Because of these reasons I give it a 3 Star but it's still a movie you will want to watch. Entertaining!"
5,HOLLYWOOD EPIC AT IT'S FINEST!,"I had to watch this movie again before making any comments. This time in my home theater and I must say,size does make a difference. This is a ""Hollywood"" movie for sure! I usually don't care for some of these kinds of films as they seem to get a little tedious, but this film is very engrossing and filled with great action. Crowe proves himself to be one of the finest actors today. I'm a big fan of Richard Harris after his Oscar worthy performance in Wrestling Ernest Hemingway and he adds credibility to this picture. The DVD transfer is great and the extras on the single disc edition are good."
1,You call this an Epic??,"This movie was probably the worst I've seen in years. Take a beautiful story, try bringing it to life using CGI, bring on some very un-talented actors, and this is what you get. Granted, I admire the effort, but it's not good enough. The sound track is the exact same soundtrack used in 'The Rock', with the addition of the talented singer from london (who actually did do good in this sound track). Poor work with the CGI - you can see when the image is real and when it isn't. This movie is certainly not the 'epic' it promised to be."
1,A poor movie in the guise of an epic,"Gladiator is a poorly directed movie with a weak script. The opening battle scene is horribly stylized and crude, consisting of scenes repeated at different angles and obvious use of computerized graphics. The gladiatorial combat scenes consists of quick cut-aways and unneeded close-ups which hide detail. A non-action scene in the movie involves a sequence of long, weary, and meaningless dialogue. The characters, especially Commodus, are poorly written for while the plot lacks structure. Russell Crowe does give a strong performance, which somewhat saves the movie. Ultimately, if we compare Gladiator to a good movie in the genre, such as Braveheart, its shortcomings become apparent."
5,one of my favorites,WONDERFUL on blu ray!! anyone who likes this movie needs it on blu ray. shipping from the seller was prompt and speedy! great transaction
5,Those who don't rate 5 stars...I dare you to name a better!.,"I can't believe that there are those so arrogant to give this less than 5 stars...I dare you to name a better film in the past year...undoubtley, those who would try, would lose all respect and credibiltiy. This movie is soo good, not only see it but it has to be in your collection!"
1,This Blu ray will NOT work on Australian (region B) players,"Hello everyone,Just to bring it to the attention of all region B player owners.The version of this movie that Amazon is selling will not play on region B Blu-ray players.I did do my research on www.bluray.com. There is information there that says it is region free but this information is wrong (at least for this version of the movie anyway).I like this movie by the way, it was my first purchase on DVD.I hope this saves some people from making the same mistake I did.Amazon are not to blame, they resolved my issue in less then 1 day. I love shopping for Blu-rays here and this will not discourage me from any future purchases. Just make sure you do your research before you buy.All the best."
5,UNBELIEVABLE!!,"I cannot say in words how much I like this movie. Russel Crowe does the BEST acting of his carrier, along with Jaquin Phoenix who does an extremely good job of a bone-chilling villain. I wish I could give this movie a hundred stars!! The action is great, and their is little gratuitus violence."
5,Really very amazing,"This film was extremely captivating, great acting, great score by Hans Zimmer, the movie was really amazing, i just brougt the DVD yesterday, i haven't seen all the special features yet, but the trailers and TV spots are great. also it was great to see how the movie was made, this movie it's really captivating, i recommend you to watch it with the DTS ES audio track, it's reallt much better than the Dolby Digital., this is definetly one of the best films of the year 2000."
5,Reason I got DVD,"I got my DVD player just to get this film. A smart move I must say. I write this 4 days after the Oscar nominations. Great film, the box office hit Russell needed. Just did not like the story between the brother & sister characters. Could have done without that. Excellant extras!!"
3,OKAY,"This movie was a little to bloody for my taste. The performances by Russel Crowe, Connie Nelson and Joaquin Phoenix (spelling?) were really good though. It's a good action \ drama movie. I especially liked the music and plan on getting the soundtrack. I recommend this movie to people who like action movies that take place in Ancient Greece \ Roman times."
5,Excellent movie,"This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Russell Crowe gave an excellent performance and the fight scene were nothing short of spectacular. This is a definite must see for anybody, no matter what kind of film you like, it is just that good."
5,Deep,"Excellent, polite customer service and very speedy processing. This product received is exactly as pictured. I am pleased. Will order again from these nice people."
1,Terrible Picture Quality on Blu Ray,"The movie itself is great, but the picture quality of this Blu Ray sucks. I hope they will issue a version with a decent transfer, this movie deserves one."
1,Over-processed picture = I'm not buying...,"Cancelled my pre-order after seeing screenshots of how badly 'damaged' this release has been by over-zealous use of digital processing. The studios need to wake up. The battle scenes are INTENTIONALLY grainy, for goodness sake, so removing the grain just destroys the movie. Thanks, but no thanks."
5,Correction to previous reviews,Yesterday 10/13 I ordered the blu-ray version of Gladiator. It arrived today. For all those wanting to get this BD the version of the disk is the corrected copy with the yellow ISBN tag on the back. It is not the old version with the video issues.
1,More Big H'Wood Shenanigans,"As mentioned by others, this BD transfer relies on digital noise reduction methods and edge enhancement to clean up the image. What this means to the average viewer is an artificially enhanced picture sub-par to the standard and potential of 1080p. You may get away with it on a 720p set.Otherwise great movie.May a rotten tomato find its way upon the producer's mug!"
3,"I'm not going to change your mind, but...","By this point, it is ridiculous to write another review for ""Gladiator"" (Right now it has around 1300 reviews), but if you're reading this and considering buying it, please do yourself a favor and rent it instead.It's a good popcorn flick that makes a great rental, especially to watch with friends. Everybody has already mentioned the dazzling visuals, so I need not go on further. Great action, great fight scenes.But the acting ranges from melodramatic to slightly less melodramatic, and the script is pure cheesiness at its worst. The movie has no depth at all, which is why most sane people question why it won an Oscar for Best Picture. The lesson in this movie is ""If you have a problem, kill somebody."" They say this (almost literally) several times within the movie, which just makes it seem like it was conceived/written by a six year old.If you are just looking for some action scenes, then here ya go. Everything else is sold separately."
2,A bit of a bore,"Equal parts Hollywood spectacle, extraordinary computer special effects, simple Goodie v. Baddie plot and maudlin sentiment. Russell Crowe (and this is a fellow Aussie writing here) proves conclusively that Best Actor Oscars really are given away with the Cornflakes. Save your money or buy ""Lord of the Rings"", or even ""Harry Potter"" - much more fun and much, much less pretentious."
3,"Not as good as I expected, but entertaining","I suppose my expectations of this movie were a bit too high. I expected a revival of the Roman Epic such as embodied by Quo Vadis and Spartacus. Unfortunately Gladiator does not quite reach that level. The plot is not strong enough and personnaly I found the use of computergravics to generate a crowd, or even a sky a bit annoying at times. This said, the movie fulfills it's most important task: It is entertaining. There is a lot of action, which looks good, (although again, the scene with the tigers features to much CGI at times) the acting is okay, with a splendid last performance by Oliver Reed and the costumes are a feast for the eyes. All in all, not bad, but a bit pretentious."
5,What a movie,"Finally yestarday i saw the film,... but the fact is I enjoyed a great production as some many people has said, i purchased this film from Amazon and it has an amazing sound quality and picture. Russell Crowe interpretation of General 'Maximus' is magnificent, he puts so much reality on it that you think you suffer the same for the lost of his family. Other thing I like from the movie, is the end, this is not the typical ""Hollywood's end', where the hero kill all the bad guys and go home happy with his family, this is a real end..., and even if it seems contradictory"
1,They choose never to hear you.,"No, I will not buy this so called Blu-ray version of Gladiator. Too many agree it's just awful. Unfortunately, I doubt if there will ever be a better version. For some reason our words make no impression. Even though we help keep them in business, they choose never to respond to our concerns. Sorry, that just the way it is. Sure hope they prove me wrong. This title deserves better."
5,Russel crow's best film,"This is my favorite movie of all time and I can't rate this movie high enough because it's just that good,written,and produced. but you should go full screen special edition if your going to buy it. plus Ridley Scott got his A Game back with this movie."
4,Thumbs up or down this is a great DVD!,"Cool musical score by Hans Zimmer, Lots of special features, Spectacular cinematagraphy, Nicely choreographed fight & battle arena scenes, And a great performance by Russel Crowe & Connie Nielsen. Joahquin Phoenix seemed too scary for playing the part of the emperor but the movie came together nicely. Still I would recommend movies about ancient Rome from the 1950's. My favorite one from that era was Cleopatra. This review refers to the DVD edition.. Get it!"
2,No DTS = No purchase!,"For months I've anticipated this new, extended version of Gladiator. During the wait, I upgraded my entertainment system to one that supports DTS 5.1. I've been thrilled to finally hear the superb DTS tracks on films such as ""Master and Commander"" and ""Lord of the Rings"".But now upon hearing that this ""new"" version is without the DTS track, I regret to say that I will NOT be purchasing it... ever. Instead, I went straight to Amazon and ordered a used copy of the signature version with DTS (which I did not have yet).Am I going to miss the 17 minutes of added footage? Sure. But I'm certain I'll catch them when viewing the DVD that someone ELSE has purchased. They can have their 17 extra minutes (with substandard sound) and I'll have the rest of the movie in DTS."
2,An Embarassment,"This has to be the worst movie ever to win an Academy Award for best picture. The opening battle scene is impressive, but the movie takes a nose dive from there. The plot is incoherent. The action sequences are edited in such a way as to completely obscure the action. The acting is not terrible, but the script is simply ludicrous from beginning to end.This movie wasted two and a half hours of my life that I will never get back."
2,Hollywood's Roman Empire,"The only thing that really makes this movie worthy of wasting our time is Russel Crowe's acting as ""Maximus"", a Roman general. I have to say, however, that this movie was a brave attempt to make an epic like those of Hollywood's golden age. Unfortunately it didn't work out and one of the main reasons for this is probably the arrogance of the filmmakers that literally distorted and changed the entire Roman history so it could fit in there movie, as if the history of the great Roman Empire was not interestig enough for hollywood. The worst of all is that Hollywood underestimated the audience's intelligence by filling the movie with frenetic scenes of battles and putting aside the real roman story(wich is much more intersting)as if the public could only be impressed by scenes in wich someone's head is cut off and not by the amazing history and legacy of the Roman Empire."
2,Expected more,"I expected way more from this movie. I had heard all the buzz, and when I finally saw it, I was pretty excited. But much to my dismay, this film fell flat. Impressive as an action movie, but lame as an epic film in the same vein as Braveheart. Russell Crowe acted only a little, but did not deserve the Academy Award. The movie was too slow at times, like after the battle in the beginning. The whole time afterwards I couldn't wait for Maximus to become a gladiator because I heard so much about those Colesseum fights. Too much talking, and I really was not interested in the story at all. I do have to admit, the fight sequences were very well done, and the technique Ridley Scott used to give the film that look of quickness ( I don't know how to descibe it) works extremely well. Gladiator is nothing but an action movie. I really did not care for the characters, and it certainly did not deserve best picture. I would have voted for Crouching Tiger."
5,Hopefully 5 star,"Gave this 5 star if it is truly a marked advance over older blu ray release of this fantastic movie.Picture of prior blu ray release was compromised by horrendous picture quality for blu ray. Hopefully this is corrected to warrant re-purchase. Also, the extended edition is 177 minutes. If this blu ray release is not 177 minutes then best to continue to buy DVD copy for added footage. Hopefully we don't need to wait another few years for both improved picture quality as well as 177 min. duration."
1,The wrong cvountry,What I mean by that is I can't play the D.V.D. It was the Europeon verssion. I have returned it. Please send me the correct one.I live in the U.S.
5,Awsome Movie,"For what I payed, I could have bought 6 compared to full price somewere else. Great deal, for a Great movie!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A DVD well worth the purchase,"I received a DVD player for Christmas and the 2 Disc Gladiator DVD as well. This disc is what I envisioned when I finally determined it was time for a DVD player. Sure DVDs have better picture and sound and you can see the film more as it was intended and try to replicate the theater experience. As a movie buff, the reason I wanted a DVD player was for background information on the movies I loved. I think it is obvious that this is a great movie, with Oscar nominations galore, but what makes the DVD so special is all the extras. Along with commentary on the movie, film trailers, and film ads there are numerous little clips cut from the movie during editing, an hour long documentary on gladiators, pictures of the storyboard for the movie and so much more. You could truly enjoy & explore all the other features on these discs for a long time to come. You wouldn't have enough time for it all in just a rental."
2,Quite Sub-Par,"I cannot seem to get over the fact that Russel Crowe won an Oscar for this! He swung a sword around for 2 hours, come on! If you want to see the Best Actor of 2000, i'll refer you to Javier Bardem (Before Night Falls). Crowe's character reached no emotional level whatsoever. We saw his wife & kid through 40 seconds of silent flashbacks, tell me why we should sympathize with his grieving?? Well photographed, well choreographed, but the rest--Craptacular."
2,From a Woman's Perspective,"You wouldn't think so from the title and the expected action and fight scenes, but this is a beautiful epic. The love story behind it is lovely but bittersweet. Ridley Scott makes the characters come to life and he makes ancient Rome come to life. Now, I am a teenage girl. I went to see Gladiator with my friend for two reasons: 1) extra credit in Latin IV, 2) Russell Crowe. By the end of the movie, I had forgotten the extra credit, but I hadn't forgotten Russell Crowe. He is marvelous. I was wary of the fighting, I didn't want to see all the gore. Okay, there is some gore, but nothing I couldn't handle. The first battle scene is amazing. When the Barbarians are heard rallying in the woods, it sent chills down my spine, it still does when I watch it on DVD. So, for the boys: you'll love it for the fight scenes. For the ladies: Russell Crowe, he needs no further explanation."
1,Where's the quality control???,"As others have mentioned already, the studios pretty much butchered the Bluray release of this masterpiece. It's sad really, because they did an excellent job with the BD release of Braveheart which was released at the same time as BD version of Gladiator."
3,Good but Overratted,"Gladiator promises the return of the great action spectacle of the 1960's but instead delivers a so-so 90's version of Spartacus. Crowe is good and the acting is decent but the story is just too long and the action scenes are done in a choppy slow motion style that takes away from any excitment we should be feeling. Plus the ending is a total downer. I just love these period epics like Braveheart, Titanic and Saving Private Ryan where the filmmakers decide to kill off the hero for the sake of nobility. This film's ending is no exception only that it has none of the impact those other films had. This film is disappointing. I was rather looking forward to it's release too."
4,"Better than ""The Patriot"" anyhow...","Unlike ""the Patriot"", this movie at least kept me interested during it's epic length. While this movie is not good enough to add to my personal collection, I think it certainly earned 4 stars for pure entertainment value. This movie had one of the strongest cast of actors I have seen in quite some time. I also liked that it did not have a sugar-coated hollywood ending. The only annoying thing was that some of the action scenes seemed really ""choppy"", and were nearly impossible to see what was happening. This is a ""fun"" movie to watch, it has a little something for everyone."
5,Gladiator the Great,The movie Gladiator swept me off of my feet from the beginning to the end. The action sequences were spectacular and magnificently arranged. Russel Crowe deserves an award or two for the unsuprisingly distinguished portrayal of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix did a magnificent job on his part of an evil ruler of Rome. This movie is a MUST SEE!
3,Remastered?? Not so sure . . .,"I purchased this in January and the copy I received seems to check out as the remastered edition (no coupon or rebate for the new copy on the cover, no ""2-disc set"" over the paramount logo, and I have the lettering on the disc itself that one of the reviewers said indicated it was the new version). However, even with the remastering, the film is quite grainy and is not quite the quality I would have expected for so recent a film. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I was definitely not blown away."
5,An Incredible Epic!,"Until I saw this film, I was beginning to seriously doubt the ability of Hollywood to produce engaging, powerful, epic films. My faith is renewed.In part, the film is a tremendous success because it conveys the notion of what it means to be a good person. Russell Crowe as general Maximus shows the viewer that a man (or woman) must act from integrity, and not from self interest. In the film, Maximus has the opportunity to return to his beloved family, so long as he will endorse the depraved emperor Commodus. Maximus does not act from self-interest, but rather from integrity by rejecting the murdeous emperor. As a result, he loses everything, but not his dignity.The film notes how words like 'honour' and 'trust' had lost meaning in the Roman Empire, and similarly poses the question of whether those words have today lost meaning for the viewer.This film is a must see! It is a classic already."
2,Should be better than it is,"I don't think I've written a review on Amazon yet for as much as I've shopped here, but I felt compelled to review this Blu-Ray release. Gladiator is one of my favorite movies and I was quite excited about this release. To much dismay, most of the movie visually feels like I am watching an upscaled DVD. There are some moments that shine, but the difference between the great quality of the extended scenes and the processing that plagues the theatrical scenes are very noticeable that it has really made me question why the whole movie couldn't be transferred with the superb visuals displayed in the extended scenes.Overall, the movie is still great with a nice bundle of extras included, but I am still very disappointed with the video quality of the theatrical footage which is what I was mostly looking forward to with this purchase."
2,Disappointing,"This is another case of a well prepared advertisement campaign. Weeks before the film entered the cinemas the world was praising the film as something nobody else had ever seen before. Now, there lay exactly the problem. The 1964 version of ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" (with Sophia Loren) tells more or less the same story but without all the sound effects available now. Take those Dolby Suround/THX effects and you will have a very dull story. That's why I insist watching The Fall of the Roman Empire might lack some technical quality but it beats The Gladiator in most parts. If you like battle scenes and man-to-man fights you get the right movie. Anything beyond that is an insult."
3,Husbands Movie,"My husband really likes this movie. I like the story line quite well, but I find it a bit too gory."
2,You MUST be kidding!,"Okay, I FINALLY got tired of all my friends telling me I had to see this movie, so we rented it over Thanksgiving holiday. What is the big deal??? Yeah, Russell Crowe looks great with muscles. Here's a tip for ya...he looked good without 'em, too, AND he seemingly could act better (Recall ""LA Confidential"" if you will, and the incredible performance he turned in for ""The Insider""). He was sleepwalking through this film. The effects were passable...I did like the overview of the Coliseum on the first day of the Games. But beyond that...yawn.The best thing about this film was Joaquin Phoenix, who proves once again, after the dreadful ""8MM"", that he can shine in anything!"
3,Good but not perfect,"A good movie but not as good as most make it out to be. Not even close to being an ""epic"" movie. And whats with the blury and fast cut fight scenes...most tv shows have better swordplay."
5,This Movie Will Be A Classic!,"Russell Crowe was definitely at his best in ""Gladiator"" playing the fierce warrior Maximus. I thought this movie had some of the most mezmerizing fight scenes and special effects ever mastered on the screen. It is a story that has been told for ages obviously but, not quit told like this. I especially loved the whole arena atmosphere it took place in. Joaquin Pheonix also does an outstanding job at being a tyrant in this movie. I have to give this movie 2 thumbs up!."
4,Historical flaws are it,"There are indeed some historical flaws in this movie, so don't purchase ""Gladiator"" as a history lesson. As a story, however, it is excellent, with stellar performances by the entire cast. There is no explicit sex (and the only innuendo is shown as desired by one party and rejected by the other, and not accomplished) and only one or two instances of swearing. There are, however, definitely some adult themes of vengeance, incest (desired by the evil emperor, so it's given proper moral context), and gore. Lots of gore. This movie is as gory as you have heard. If that doesn't bother you, however, and great themes of courage, nobility, and justice float your boat, you should purchase this movie."
5,Gladiator,"The remastered Blu-ray version (Yellow UPC Code) is stunning, and the movie itself is very good.As I indicated in the previous sentence the remastered version is identified by a YELLOW UPC Code on the back of the case, and ""2-Disc Set"" above the Paramount Logo on the bottom right of the back of the case.I still have the original Blu-ray version of Gladiator and have decided to keep it just in case it might become a collector's item despite the poor transfer. At least I can compare it to those interested the difference between the two versions in case they want to purchase the Blu-ray.NOTE: Another indication of the remastered version is a normal WHITE UPC Code on the back of the case, with the ""2-Disc Set"" REMOVED above the Paramount Logo."
3,Best picture? Not likely!,"This is my second review of Gladiator. Why? Because I am that disappointed that it got the award for best picture. This movie was typical summer fodder for American film-goers. A story that was akin to Braveheart with a predictable plot. Yawn. Oh, the action sequences were great - though they were too few. The subplots were under-developed. This movie was just okay.If you want to see the real best picture of 2000 look no further than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Also much better is Traffic.American movies are so self-absorbed with big budget over the top CGI than bombard you and leave any resemblence of story to waste. Titanic, Pearl Harbor, Gladiator....when will the litany of pomp and circumstance end?"
1,"Artificial, Contrived, Etc.","This movie was better when it was called ""Ben Hur."" And I hated ""Ben Hur."" The effects here were so overdone, the computer-generated scenery so artificial, I felt ill. Computer imagery ought to be used only when necessary, and with a budget like this clunkers,' real scenery would have been easy. The acting was fair, I'll admit, but the script so trite and forced one wonders why the actors even bother. Oh, yeah....money. This movie is all hype. bleckt"
1,"Boring, boring, boring","The only thing this movie inspired in me was sleep. It was like watching a movie while being high on novacaine, a truly mind numbing experience. The whole experience was a terrific letdown after seeing the previews on television. I went to the theater thinking I was going to see an epic, and came home deadened and thanking God that there are other good movies to see. If all movies were this horrible, I'd never set foot in a theater again."
2,Eyes Glazed Open....,"...I seldom dislike things and if I do I seldom feel compelled to speak on my dislike here in Friends and Favorites. I did not like this because after the big build up after the Oscars, it led me to believe that this was gonna be more. The graphics and the recreation of the Area and those firght scenes were alright, but the story line I found kinda boring....not too different from those B Gladiator Movies from the 50s and 60s starring Victor Mature or Chuck Connors. I am one of the few people on earth who is unimpressed with Russell Crowe, he of the same pompousness that created Richard Burton--you never saw Burton in a comedy and you never will see Crowe in one because each takes/took himself waaaaay too seriously. Case in point, this product. My wife paid for the tickets so I was forced to keep my eyes..."
4,Great Movie too pricey,"I love this movie and it is one of my all time favorites and as much as I would love to get this new extended edition, it cost too much. I only gave it 4 stars because of the price, but I assume in due time it will come down and I will eventually buy it. I mean it is only a DVD just like every other one that are all cheaper for one movie. If you love this movie then plan on buying it because it is definitly worth it, and I am not much of a Russel Crowe fan. But I suggest to wait for the price to go down otherwise you are a sucker."
2,Best movie? Nah!!!,"I realise I am voicing a minority opinion here but I just did not enjoy Gladiator. For me, it was an ok movie and nothing more. It certainly does not compare favourably to classic Roman epics like Spartacus and Quo Vadis. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre at best. I certainly did not feel any sympathy for Maximus in his time of sorrow. Derek Jacobi's senator was a waste of screen time. Commodus came off as a whiny cowardly brat.The best movie of 2000 was Titus. The acting was first class , the directing superb and the movie had a dialogue from a true master, William Shakespeare. Too bad the academy did not agree with me."
2,100 % Brutality,"Well, the movie itself is brilliant. Cameras, scenes, shots, actors, everybody did a great job. However, it seems to me that the movie's a little bit too brutal. In almost every shot you see somebody getting killed or somebody dead. After an hour or so, I was really bored by this movie."
2,Halfway there.,"I've been a big fan of Crowe since Romper Stomper and thought he was great in LA Confidential, but in Gladiator there's really not much for him to do but grunt. The opening battle scene was a mess and early on set the pattern for all that followed in the arena. Scott seems to have gone for the typical high gloss form of Hollywood filmmaking, employing quick cuts with something flying into the camera every second (the latter seems to be the action norm ever since the Twister trailer). The ending is the very definition of anti-climatic. Bottom line, Gladiator never figured out if it wanted to be Braveheart or 13th Warrior, and as a result ended up stuck somewhere between an epic film and a fun movie. Too bad it couldn't make up its mind. Still, I'm looking forward to the DVD's commentary tracks; if nothing else, at least it looked pretty."
2,Don't waste 2 1/2 hours of your life,"I didn't find this movie that much of an attention grabber. The storyline was very slow and very long. You have to really be interested in ancient Rome to enjoy this movie. Or just be into Russel Crowe. I also found the storyline hard to follow. One of the only good things that caught my eye, or my ear I should say, was the soundtrack. The composer did an excellent job with the soundtrack.The other thing that caught my eye was some of the special effects.The acting by Joaquin Phoenix was just atrocious. I can't believe they made this guy such a cry baby. His mellowdramatic scenes were some of the worst that I had ever seenI would only recommend this to someone that really likes Russel Crowe. Women, I have to tell you, you don't see that much of him. In fact, they must have run around everywhere wearing armor, because that's pretty much what he wore the whole movie."
2,I guess my expectations were too high. Disappointed.,"One of my favorite movies of all time is Braveheart and I had heard such glowing reviews of Gladiator and often comparisons to Braveheart that I couldn't wait to see it. I found it mostly boring. The storyline never caught me....I never felt for the character Russel Crowe played (though he was GREAT in the Insider). Joaquin Phoenix did make a pretty good ""bad guy"" but overall I was disappointed."
3,All in all a I mediocre film.,"Russell Crowe does an adequate job in this long ""epic"". He doesn't have the charisma and draw of other great actors, but he does well enough to keep you watching.I didn't find this to be the incredible action movie that many portrayed it to be. The battle scenes were good, although not at the level of greats like Braveheart or the Patriot.I found much of the movie to be slow moving, although the subplot with Ceasar and his sister was intriguing.Young Ceasars character played by Joaqin Phoenix was excellent. He had me hating him within minutes!Over all this is a good film, but don't expect it to knock your socks off."
2,What's the big deal?!,"WOW. We've seen a lot of war movies. This one just has a ""GLADIATOR"" theme added into it. I just have one word fir this movie: BORING. I almost fell asleep. Most people won't agree, but I think this movie is entirely overrated. On the DVD, the picture is so dark the whole time, you can only see half of what's going on. DUMB. Sure, it has what it takes to look like a masterpiece, but there's something more entertaining missing, that I just can't explain."
1,Very disappointing,"This is the best movie of 2000? Nothing but gore, and more gore. The acting was horrible-Russell Crowe has two expressions, angry and stoic. This is a Ben-Hur wannabe but it fell far far short of that great movie. Sad that this pitiful excuse for a Best Picture will go down as an Oscar Winner."
3,It could have been great,"Of the film itself, the end is awful. If you want to watch epic battles and duels and plot and everything, watch this film, then turn it off 10 minutes before the end. Dream what should happen, then take the disc out.Put simply, a great film but the ending is so feeble, it completely fooks it up."
1,"millions spent on fx, hundreds spent on story development","One reviewer described _Gladiator_ as 'one of the best movies ever,' and adds that 'if you liked _Braveheart_, you'll love this movie!' That ought to tell you everything you need to know. I will never cease to be amazed at the amount of praise that was heaped on this movie. The story dragged on and on; historical verity was pure Hollywood, so far as I could tell; and nothing seemed so important as pretty scenery and luminous cinematographic effects. Finally, the dialogue was nothing short of embarrassing--towards the end, my friend and I gave up all efforts to conceal our laughter. Neither Crowe's bedrock solidity nor Joaquin Phoenix' Fiennes-like homoerotic flamboyance could save this film (check out the latter's 'busy little bee' tirade). If you *must* see this film, get extremely high first--your critical faculties will require dulling in order to get through it."
1,'Gladiator' pretends to be a great movie.,"'Gladiator' pretends to be a great movie, but it didn't fool me. There not a single original idea in the entire film; an outcast's family is killed by the evil emperor, the outcast trains himself to get revenge, the outcast kills the emperor in the end. Hasn't this story been told many many times before and with much better acting and storytelling? I guess millions of other people were fooled because this movie won a bunch of awards and made millions."
3,Great acting; horrible soundtrack,"Phoenix makes an especially good bad guy as emperor Commodus. He practically froths at the mouth from his box as gladiators butcher one another. As for Crowe: if you have any doubts about his acting ability, please see Romper Stomper (1993). His character in that movie, the charismatic but terrifyingly cold leader of a gang of skinheads, is the polar opposite of the one he plays here in Gladiator.The soundtrack, insipid vocals, is so bad it nearly ruined the movie for me. What starts out embarrassingly out of place, by climax just grates. Scott managed to get competent innovative sound out of Vangelis for Blade Runner, so what's up here?"
3,poor handling by amazon,"i bought more than $140 of dvd's movies from amazon and i buy them for my collections. all movies arrived well except two. one was ""avant"" that dvd was not burned right, and the second one was gladiator that the dvd's inside the package were intact but the pacckage was busted in one corner like some one droped it or hit it, basically looked dammaged. For acollector that is disapointing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. i hope amazon rectifies this."
2,Disappointing,"This movie could have been great. Russell Crowe is, despite the not so well written screenplay and mediocre plot, very convincing in his role, in fact he is the only one who makes a pretty good job in this movie - Phoenix was not bad. But that just because Russell Crowe in an excellent actor. The movie fails because it was bad told, and not well directed. You couldn't identify nor share the characters feelings because of the large distance there seemed to be between them and the audience, and that's where the director fails, in the telling of the story."
3,Good film. But not great!,"Wow! I'm glad this movie got Oscars! It was deserved! The best of the year!.....Ooops wait! I was actually thinking of ""Traffic"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (Which showed how politically unfair the Academy Awards were when they both lost best picture to this work of unoriginal, mediocre quality) The fighting scenes are entertaining, but between the action you'll want to fast forward over the unintelligent dialouge and card-board acting. Poor Russell Crowe, who was looked over at the Oscars for his great performance in The Insider and won for a very overrated performance in this (If you watched the Oscars that night you'll know that he knew that as well). Poor Academy voters, who have yet to make up for continuing to let mediocre, non-challenging movies that has the artistic merit of a advertising billboard, win the top awards. It was entertaining! But also very lacking."
5,The Gladiator Experience,"When I first saw this movie, I was truly amazed. This was one of the best movies of 2000 from the battle for Germany lead by Maximus to the final battle between Maximus against Commodus the Emperor of Rome. Australian Russell Crowe has done an outstanding performance as Maximus and I soon learned that he did his own stunts in that movie. That is unbelievable but true. It truly deserved Oscars for being the #1 movie in America. One star for powerful story, One star for great action, One star for brilliant acting by Russell Crowe, one star for spectacular visuals of Rome, and one star for all the hard work that Ridley Scott did to make this movie a success.5 stars is my rating and there is no good reason why you cannot rate this movie one star. (Unless you are a Roman historian!)"
3,RUMORS,I kept going over and over the reviews on amazon about this bluray being shotty. So I held off buying it until i figured they had worked out the bugs. The bugs being the not so good transfer of the film into the bluray format. I bought it when i heard it was all set and received it and checked the indicators that it was the newer edition distributed by WB. The picture quality on about 60% was high quality while many of the scenes had a heavy grain accompanied by specs of blinking small lights. It was enough to be very much noticeable. Im not going to send it back because i doubt they will com out with another for sometim and im content with the way it is right now.
5,"ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOVIES...EXCELLENTE QUALITY OF IMAGE, GREAT PRICE.","THE DVD HAS AN EXCELLENTE PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY, MORE THAN EXPECTED TO BE HONEST. THE PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE. RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE. THX."
1,Don't give them money for trash!,"Please people don't buy this movie. I'm not a picky movie guy but I did notice the difference between the regular scenes and the extended cut scenes. How could anyone at the movie studio say 'looks good to me.'?!?!?!I was invited to watch it with a local newspaper reviewer who said he knew of the issue before hand and, with out telling me that there are issues, asked me after the movie how I felt. I told him I think his TV is messed up or the disk is bad. He then told me what was wrong and it all snapped together.He saved me and many in St. Louis who read his review some money."
1,Zero stars - DO NOT BUY Amazon selling you broken/inferior product,"I will not rehash all the explanations on the problems with the Gladiator Blu-ray - please read the other reviews for a technical explanation. Suffice it to say there is a ""new"" version that has been cleaned up and looks gorgeous and there is an ""old"" version that is junk. The old version was so bad that the studio recognized it and decided it needed to be corrected.But guess what, Amazon insists on clearing out their old stock and selling you the junk version. I ordered this last week and figured there is no way they would be doing this. But guess what, I WAS WRONG.Here's a giveaway - on the cover of the case there is a mail in rebate that expired in JUNE 2010!!!Absolutely pathetic showing by Amazon."
1,Avoid this one. It's not what you think,"The picture quality for this one is very poor. It's a total mess. Universal just did an upscale of the DVD transfer creating artifacts, noise and blur over the picture. I really don't know what they're thinking with this one. This movie should have a re-release with a proper picture quality.Besides that, the movie deserves a better sound mix like the first DVD release.Shame on you Universal :("
5,Great!,"The extras in this DVD are fabulous. The ""commentary"" by Ridley Scott is actually a second copy of the entire movie with him talking about each scene as it takes place. Most of the deleted scenes are great; in a lot of movies, the deleted scenes are deservedly deleted, but for Gladiator, Scott cut them purely for time concerns, and they actually add to the movie as a whole. I loved it on screen, and as a DVD it's even better."
3,What was all the fuss about?,"This movie was overrated. While it's an okay adventure film, the story's plot holes are large and glaring and rather frustrating. The acting was workmanlike, but really undeserving of any extra praise, and Crowe certainly did not give an Oscar-caliber performance.Additionally, the film was disappointingly historically inaccurate. Commodus reigned as emperor for about thirteen years, was a physically imposing individual of daunting martial prowess, and his death was the result of intrigue and poison rather than as portrayed in the film.I wish I'd rented this, rather than having bought a copy for my extensive dvd collection. Oh, well."
1,"Blu-Ray review: Sapphire Series, really??","This edition of Gladiator on Blu-Ray is a joke. I'm a huge fan of the film, and was really looking forward to this movie getting a picture quality overhaul. Instead, we are treated to an old transfer of the film, with a bunch of image processing slapped on. They tinkered with the picture so much that some of the scenes are actually missing details seen on the original DVD!!!!! Some of the flaming arrows are missing from the battle scene, every close-up shot of a character has a halo around the actor (due to a process they applied call Edge Enhancement). These studios need to wake up, we don't want the film altered! We just want the cleanest conversion of a movie possible, even if that includes film grain!This is just really disappointing as one of the first Blu-Rays to be dubbed ""Sapphire Series"". They need to fix this, or Sapphire will just become a joke."
1,Watch actual Film Elements being removed on the Blu-ray,"Checkout this comparison, when the mouse is off of the picture you see a picture of the HD broadcast version, when you move the mouse over you see the blu-ray version. Along with the arrows in the battle disappearing, due to over processing.h[...]"
5,Awesome,"Great movie. This one is included in our 10 top movie list of all time....well, until current year, 2013. Great via blu ray."
5,Great movie,"Even after seeing this movie at least five times, it still keeps my attention like I was watching for the first time.I don't think I can tell you anything different than 1000 other reviewers have told you. Watch the movie, enjoy and don't take everything to heart."
4,THE film of the year 2000,"I have to confess when i saw the presentation in the TV about this movie i just tought it was another summer disaster..opss..sorry.. i mean summer movie. Well as soon the video edition came out in my video club i only rent it because of the oscars it had won and i was courious. The first 5 minutes was enough to change my mind. Almoust perefct in every way : the director (THE great Mr Scott)did a great job (the action scenes are great and also the flash backs); good plot; Russel is the perfect heroe : a man tormented by the death of his Joaquin family trying to avange them, in the oposite corner is Phoenix the ""vilan"" who is fourious by the chose of his father to give the power of the empire to a a general; one of the best soundtrack i had ever heard; and excelent psecial efects: I really recomend it."
2,Agree with Ebert,"I agree with Roger Ebert, this [was terrible]! I thought Crowe would be great, like he's a great actor! He [wasn't]! Pheonix had no depth like he did in Signs! He showed no enthusiasm, he was dull and his character was in love with his sister, how dumb is that? The sister wasn't any help! The hero was a gladiator, no problem there, only a dull gladiator, problem! The only one I liked was the slave that helped out Maximus(Crowe), he was pretty good! And of course, I like Russel Crowe but he was bad in this movie, get another one of his, any other of his is better then this,..."
3,overrated,"I feel this movie is overrated. Sure the graphic and sound are good. However this movie has no story line. They spent too much money on the clothes and the set to make it look ""realistic"" that they over-do it. Perhaps that's why they didn't have any money left for a real plot. The actor isn't suck, but any other actor could have played the role the same. There's nothing great here about this guy's acting. See it for what it is: good fighting scenes."
3,Gladiator: Beauty without a script,"Gladiator is a movie with two faces; on one are epic battle sequences that are as awe-inspiring as they are graphic, on the other, a hideous script with bad lines. This movie drags in the center very badly. I saw the movie and the battle scenes are the only things that kept me awake, otherwise this movie is abysmal. The battle scenes alone make this movie worth watching; but other than that, there isn't anything new here."
4,tast E flipa's review,"The DVD The quality of the DVD is fantastic, great audio and picture quality. A ton of added features, so much in fact I haven't even seen everything yet. (flipa review = 5 stars)The Movie A good plot and awesome musical score will keep you thoroughy entertained. The acting overall is terrific, Russell Crowe plays his role to perfection, and you will love to hate Jauquin Phoenix as the evil Claudius. My only complaint is that it's a bit long for my taste. (flipa review = 4 stars)"
5,Excellent,"This film made the Roman Army real. History at it's finest! Wonderful costumes, great color. Will watch this again, worth the rental!"
5,the best movie ever made,I have watched this movie everyweek clips from it everyday and i know the script by heart.you need to own this and the gladiator music cds.alanwww.thebarbecuemaster.com
2,Cheesy at Best,The only things that saved this movie from mediocrity were the acting qualities of Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix as well as some of the excellent editing achieved in some of its scenes -- particularly the initial battle scenese with the Goths and in some of the gladiator scenes when in Rome. Otherwise a historically inaccurate depiction with set designs resembling Ceasars in Las Vegas than Rome in the distant past.
3,"Hey, it's a GLADIATOR movie","Wish I'd seen it in the theater. Was farily bored watching it, even in DD. Cameron Crowe is good, but in the end it doesn't veer much from other Gladiator movies made long ago. Save your money and wait for Cast Away to come to DVD."
1,Gladiator [Blu-ray],"If you love this movie, you must import German Blu-ray's Gladiator 10th Anniversary Edition! Excellent picture and sound quality and 2 disc set. Region code free for both discs! and more special features!!! I imported Robin Hood Limited Steelbook from UK and it was not good... Second disc was DVD and region 2 and PAL... I couldn't watch it... But German remastered 2 Blu-ray set Gladiator's great! You can watch everything!!! You must check amazon.de now!!!!!"
1,Horrible Ending,"The movie Gladiator was a very good movie; right up to the last 20 minutes. Director Ridley Scott did a very good job at making a Rome, let's not take anything away from him. But I must say that I didn't like the ending. I like history, and I do not like how Hollywood is re-wrirting history. First ""The Patriot"", and now this. When people come out of the theater, they really think that Commodus was killed by a slave, general then slave sorry. Hollywood is filling people's, espically kid's, minds with flase information that they think is true. I mean, come on, where were the historacal adviors in these movies?"
2,"Good Movie, but Best Picture of the Year?","This was a good action flick, and all the fights and battles are great. Russel Crowe does a great job and deserves praise. But the movie doesn't flow logically. The reasons Crowe was made a slave aren't clear... he's crying at the death of his family, and a foot appears... next he's a slave. This coming from the man who has fought his way out of so many battles, including death in Germany when the current ruler was overthrown. There are several moments where I wasn't sure why things were happening. That's okay for an action flick, but I expect more from the Academy. Are we ready to throw plot development out the window when the action is good? Man, I hope not! By the way, the recreation of Rome was awesome, another plus for the movie. So why did I give it only two stars? Well, to be honest, in protest over the Academy's nomination... not that the field was all that great this year..."
4,darn good flic,"good movie. rather long, but the story kept you interested, so no complaints about that. great props and scenery and the story line was interesting. the action sequeces were full of energy however the only downfall as far as i'm concerned was the lack of grewsomeness (if thats a word). i'm not a blood loving type. not any more than the next person, however unlike movies like braveheart where the action was bloody like it would be in real life, the fights weren't quite as bloody as would be in real life. example, during one of the fights in the stadium, someone gets cut completely in half, but not alot of blood or guts. other than that...i'd definately recommend buying this movie."
3,This was entertaining but no masterpiece,"This was a good movie to watch on DVD but some of these reviews are ridiculous. There is a reason why this movie didn't win any awards. It's just not that great. It was an interesting story with some good action scenes but overall it is just another action movie. Crowe did a great job in his part but this was certainly no Braveheart. If you havent seen it you should, but its not going to change your life or anything."
4,Much Improved Blu Ray transfer,I originally purchased Gladiator some years ago. The video transfer was widely panned as a sub-standard effort in video transfer to Blu Ray. I thought it barely better than standard DVD quality. I bought it again and this time the transfer was excellent....much improvement. If you want this film in your library it is worth the repurchase.
2,Best Picture? Why?,"They lost me when they gave this one the ""Best Picture."" I disliked it so much, when my video store wouldn't buy it from me, I left it on the counter and offered it to the first person who was willing to pick it up. There's much better out there, and although the cinematography is fantastic, I wouldn't want to wade my way through this movie again, unless I was fast asleep."
5,A must-have DVD,Gladiator is one of my best DVDs as it's fully loaded with extra features and of course a great movie.You feel that is real and you are into this story from the beginning. It quite a long movie but I enjoyed all of it.I even enjoyed the scenes that finally were cut as I had to hear director's comments. There is also an hour documentary on the history of gladiators and believe it is very interesting. You will enjoy finally the how was shooted part where you will see all the fantastic graphics and tricks as well as laugh with Russel's Crow comments. I recommend this DVD to everyone that starts to build a quality DVD movie collection.
5,Gladiator- a thriller to go down in history,"Gladiator opens with a captivating and impressively filmed first scene. The acting never fails throughout the film, from the first scene to the last. Joaquin Phoenix supported Crowe superbly, and kept the movie rolling steadily without lagging in any place. The DVD also has a well done documentery on the topic of actual gladiators. Also included on the specials is the making of ""Gladiator"". The acting is captivating, and excellent, the special effects also excellent. Russell Crowe deserves every bit of praise he has recieved.-Ollwerther '01"
5,My favorite movie of all time,"The moment i saw gladiators trailer on tv i knew i wanted to see it. I was first in line to get into the theater. When i finally saw it i wasnt disappointed. This movie has everything action, drama, suspence, and an A++ story line. This movie should go down in history as one of the best ever. Those makes the Titanic sink below the Atlantic. If you are unsure about this movie think no further. SO IT. ENJOY IT. LOVE IT. Like I did."
5,Russell Crowe is THE hottest guy i have EVER seen,"This is the best movie i have ever seen and if you didn't see it yet, you need to! trust me....once you see how hot Russell Crowe looks, you won't even stop watching it!"
1,RIP OFF ALERT!,"Unbelievable!Gladiator was the film that I was looking forward to the most when I got into ""High Def"". Ironically after waiting for Gladiator to be released in High Definition, now that I have see seen this ""blu-ray"", I AM STILL WAITING FOR GLADIATOR TO BE RELEASED IN HIGH DEFINITION! I don't know if this transfer was meant as a joke or not, but after watching the blu-ray and DVD side by side, the difference is so minimal that it is really making me rethink any catalog repurchase on Blu."
1,Do not buy the Blu-Ray!!,The Blu-Ray release has filtering and over processing in the image. It looks terrible! Do not buy.
2,Old Version Still Being Shipped,"I ordered Gladiator this week hoping for the new version per other discussions & reviews. Unfortunately, Amazon is still sending out the old version at least in my case. I called Paramount Home Entertainment (888-889-9456) and they verified my copy I rec'd on Aug. 10 was the old version. They also indicated the old version had been pulled & discontinued. Verification was done by asking two questions: 1) What was the color of the UPC label, yellow not white is the new version, and 2) What is the ID number on the back side of Disc 1 near the center. I had to use a magnifying glass to read it beginning with the letters ""NA"" and ending with ""R1"" for the old version or ""R2"" for the new. They instructed me to send disc 1 only to them with my name, address & phone for a replacement set."
1,Gladiator in Wax City,"Unfortunately this blu-ray is way under par.They have used an old master, which they have DNR:d (filtered) and then tried to sharpen artificially.The result is astonishingly bad.No resemblance to the blu-ray of Braveheart, which looks extremely good!!Unfortunately so, since this is one of my favorite films.Even if its' hard to resist - don't buy it. You'll thank me later.Sapphire series - what a joke!"
1,consumers will revolt,"We don't want an old master. We already own that version on DVD. The only reason we buy it again is to see a glorious new HD remaster, which has not been provided. Fail."
3,Gladiator ( Extended Edition ),"They did a great job with the entire film. But, they did a poor job with the audio. What happened to the DTS ES 6.1 audiothat the first release had. It makes this a downer. Come onare they planning to hit us with another version?"
5,the best of a disappointing year in films.,"i thoroughly enjoyed this film when i saw it in the theatres and when i saw it later on DVD. i also enjoyed the extras, and was wondering why some of those scenes were left out, like the meeting between the senators and priscilla's character. it really showed the importance of what was going on. i thought the lion-mauling-a-boy-scene was pretty stupid though and glad that it was left out. it should have been left out of the deleted scene selection. but in any case, even now in december, without having seen crouching tiger, hidden dragon yet, gladiator is still the best movie of the year and i hope it is well honored at the oscars."
4,One for the home collection,"This is a good movie that does a great job with the special effects and creation of fighting in the roman colliseum. There are points when the movie drags, but if you bought a dvd player for the picture and sound (why elso would you?) You must have this on DVD."
5,Gladiator,This is an action packed portrayal of the old Greek and Roman times. Russel Crow is as always fantastic. Enjoyed this movie very much and recomend it highly.
4,Cool,Pretty good movie I am a sucker for special features so getting this over the regular version was a no brainier to me.
4,Gladiator stretches the bounds of believability...,The worst of all is the notion that a man who can go single handed against 10 or so other gladiators and slice them all down (or to pieces) one after the other in a small arena on the outskirts of the empire - would so calmly allow himself to be re shackled at the end of each performance by a minimum security force belonging to a merchant/slave trader. High Plains Drifter was a much more realistic scenario.
3,It wasn't that great,"I've seen Gladiator but don't own it. Looking at all these great reviews for it, though, I'm admit I'm tempted to buy it. The movie has many good parts in it, like in the beginning when there's a big battle. All the battle and action scenes in the movie are good too, but the opening one is my favorite. This is all I really liked, though, the action. The other stuff -- the acting, dialog, and ending -- wasn't any good. For those who've read 'Hamlet' you'll know the ending was unoriginal. I vaguely remember reading 'Hamlet' in high school, but I know it ended with poison, like 'Gladiator' does. So the ending's no good. The acting and dialog is pretentious. So many looks and words are exaggerated or embellished for effect. R. Crow's performance is good, and he's a good actor, but I think he's almost too good, to the point where he's unbelievable. For me, and I'm sure for everyone, I need to believe a movie to really appreciate it."
2,Big Budget Bomb,"I thought ""Gladiator"" was remarkably uncompelling. The much ado about its CGI effects only made everyone think virtually every scene was computer generated. The effects themselves look totally unreal and strangely prototypical, as if they hadn't quite figured it all out yet. And the DVD is reverently packaged like everyone involved was confident they'd made a masterpiece. They didn't. And the last shot of Russell Crowe walking toward his wife and son reminded me uncomfortably of that idiotic walk into the clouds at the end of another preposterous Roman epic,'The Robe.' Kubrick's 'Spartacus' is nearly 40 years old, but it's infinitely more advanced than 'Gladiator.'"
2,Good idea - bad implementation,"I went to see Gladiator knowing that it wouldn't be historically accurate but expecting at least a good movie. Unfortunately, the movie dragged. If it had been shorter/tightened up it would have been better. The biggest surprise and disappointment was the bad visual effects. The transitions between computer-generated images and live action were obvious and sloppy. It would have been easier to forgive the freedom with historical fact if the overall effect was better. All-in-all, I was very disappointed with the quality of the movie. Russel Crowe did a good job, as did several other actors, but they couldn't save Gladiator from mediocrity."
4,Remastered Edition B1R2. Hurray!,Definite way to verify remastered edition is B1R2 on the disc. Thanks a lot to previous reviewers to point it out.
5,Ridley Scott's Vision Is Realized In This Epic!!,I am fascinated by the history of the Roman Empire. That being said I think that Ridley Scott is a genius and that this is by far his best film. In scope alone it leaves an impression. Everything else about this film is perfect from the sets and costumes to the academy award winning performance that Russell Crowe gave as Maximus. This film asks questions that we as a society face every day the questions of right and wrong and what happens after you die. Overall this film is one of my favorites and definitley worth watching. This DVD is loaded with making of documentaries and has a commentary on the extended cut of the film definitley worth a buy!!
4,"Powerful, simple revenge story","Hero is betrayed, but gets his vengeance in the end. Its a simple plot, brilliantly executed. I liked the way Russell Crowe played the character - subtle strength and determination. But I suppose everyone knows that by now.The emperor, on the other hand, was also acted well. One could sense the cunning behind the eyes, and his ephemeral whims spoke of a psychotic demon. A man to be feared and despised for his weak-willed nature.Would this movie have gone any better without the last victim?"
5,powerfully moving,one of the greatest summer blockbusters of all time Gladiator is action packed and kinetic. the opening scene is one of the best openings of a war movie ever. choreography is stellar. the fights in the colloseum are splendidly made. Russell Crowe excelently plays the general maximus a simple minded yet important man to the emperor of Rome.Forced to fight in the arena after the emperors son commodus kills maximus' wife and kid Gladiator doesn't run out of action. Joaquin Phoenix superbly plays his role. An evil self mannered man who just wants power in Rome. action packed with some of the best fight scenes around Gladiator packs a huge punch.
3,good movie but not enough time to watch,I rented this movie but it was rather late and I did fall asleep on it. I'd see it again but I think for an older movie like this Amazon should allow you to have permission to view it for at least 3 days not one.
1,DOESNT WORK,Tried to watch it on both my xbox360 and dvd player to find that its some cheap copy that wont even work. Very disappointed.
5,A DVD for the ages!!,"Gladiator is one of the best big movies of all-time. Not only was the acting phenomenal, but the storyline, usually missing from blockbuster films, was superb. First, the film opens with a fascinating battle scene that gets your heart pumping and eyes open. Next, the action slows down but the plot grips. Finally, the film takes the viewer on a roller coaster of plot twists and turns with great action to go along. At the expense of spoiling the movie for anyone my overall review of this film is that it is one of the best buys on DVD available on the market today. Not only is the movie great but the oodles of special features will keep you entertained for months. All in all, one of the best DVD's of all time."
1,Don't waste tour money,"I fully concur with the other reviews here of the Blu-ray release of this film. Outstanding move, atrocious picture quality.But there's hope...Paramount has just announced the release of a newly re-mastered version and an exchange program for those duped into buying this version. Call this number to arrange for your replacement disk: (888) 889-9456.For those who have yet to buy, the new re-mastered version should be available in stores soon. It will be identifiable by a yellow UPC label (the original was white)."
5,Great respect for not losing the sight of the main idea....,"This was one of the best movies i have seen for one simple fact. From beginging to end the director never lost the guiding principle behind the Russel Crowes characters motives. As it was in the begining as it was in the end the motivation for all his actions and decisions remained the same, they did not get lost within layers and layers of useless conotations and sub-plots...like most movies today which try and be ""deep"" and filled with meaning; however, far to often they choke on their own bad writing and unbelievability. This movie showed more depth and meaning by staying with one guideing principle and i loved it!"
4,Amazing Crowe and action,"Russell Crowe has a definite presence on the big screen and he makes Gladiator his own as Maximus, a general in ancient Rome. Beginning with an impressively staged battle in Germany, Crowe embodies this warrior with his whole being. The favorite of Richard Harris' Caesar to take over Rome, Crowe refuses, and ends up as a slave whose only existence is to fight in the arenas, where most of the warriors die very young deaths. Maximus sees this as his chance to redeem himself.Besides Crowe's terrific performance, Harris and the late Oliver Reed, as Profumo, Maximus' master, deliver wonderful performances.The special effects are amazing as well, from the battle and action sequences, to the renderings of the Colosseum and ancient Rome. Gladiator is a top-notch action film, and one that signals Russell Crowe as a major star on the rise."
1,Mess,"Agree with other reviews - the disc is a mess and no better than DVD - in fact with DNR and EE on blue ray - the processing shows up even more!A disasterWhat were they thinking?Paramount, please do this right and remaster the movie for true 1080P - no processing is fine; film grain is fine - just give us all of the detailDo not buy!"
4,great ACTION!!! film,"This is an action file. Russell Crowe is excellent as Maximus, but the film has an overly weedy villain who lets the film down. I have no doubt that most people will enjoy this and for good reason: Fantastic battle set-pieces, Exciting, it doesn't really seem three hours long, stunning backdrops and realistic locations, Great performance by Crowe, probably deserving the Best Actor he received, So enjoy but don't expect much more than a fantastic three hours fun with little to think about."
5,Good Movie,"After winning an Oscar(c) for Best Picture, this movie is just perfect for that title. Even though Gladiator is not for the 'squelish' (battle scenes show much violence), this movie is certainly the best movie I have ever seen and anybody who watches will agree 100%."
1,blu-ray compatibility,"After purchasing the Avatar blu-ray/standard dvd set, I will never buy another blu-ray until the studios get their act together vis-a-vis formats. The Avatar blu-ray can't play on any of my blu-ray players because the format is not compatible! So now we have different formats of the blu-ray format! How convoluted will this format become! It was an expensive lesson to learn. If not for the included standard version, I would not have been able to view this film at all. Thank you very little, F___ you very much - to all who were responsible for this marketing disaster!"
2,nothing but eye candy,"Here's the way I see it: all movies get at least one star, because that's the lowest rating. Gladiator gets two stars: one for existing, and the other for being nice to look at. The cinematography is excellent, the CGI effects are amazing, and the action is good. The problem is, Gladiator is nothing but a loosely strung together series of money shots. The plot and dialogue fail to hold interest for more than a few minutes at a time. You can sleep through all but ten scenes or so, and you won't be missing anything."
5,Best Movie,"Best movie period. Love, drama, Rome, Maximus, fighting. You will love the scene in the Coloseum when the emperor asks who the gladiator is. Great opening battle. Nice ending. Acting is good."
