1,confessions of a sell-out,"When I initially picked up this book, I had no idea that I would be reading a bunch of justifications for the treatment that African-Americans receive in this country. He even went as far as to justify the bombings of African-American churches by saying that white churches were burned over seven times that amount in a year. Bottom line, this guy is a sell-out who obviously had it easy growing up, and fails to realize that racism still plagues society. He knows nothing about the black community, is probably married to a white lady, and lives in the suburbs. Mr. McWhorter, I am very disappointed in this book and I know your ancestors are too. As a matter of fact, tommorrow I am going to the store to get my money back!!"
3,His pass is revoked,"McWhorter lost me when he found it reasonable that a D.C. representative could innocently use the word niggardly to mean miserly, yet found it unbeleivable that a Stanford Math professor told a young black female blacks were not good in math. Typical sell-out. Anything to sell a book ,eh johnnie? By agree to the stereotypes of white America, and defending some of their ideals as our problems not theirs, you hope to garner support for your book sales. The jewish had a name for your ilk, it was called judenrat...sell out in other words. Only the names have changed"
2,"Good message, but too difficult to read","While I agree with the author's message, the style in which he delivers is too complex and convoluted. You will need a dictionary at hand to read this book. Sentence structure was far too comlplex and ambiguous. I think it could have been written in half the length, resulting in a much more enjoyable read."
2,Did not last,Only lasted a dozen uses before it stopped hanging on well. I would not bother with this product. In this case quality does matter 100%.
2,Poor description - capsules are fragile,It was impossible to tell from the description how much calcium citrate was in each capsule. It turns out there is 150mg each so I have to take 8 of them to get the recommended dose. Other brands have over 300mg each so it takes half as many. This makes accurate price comparison impossible. I also didn't like the fact that the capsules came apart when I travelled with them.
3,Bollywood Hero funny but.....,"Bollywood Hero tells the story of how Chris Kattan tries to go to India to work on a Bollywood film in order to achieve respect after he gets fed up with not being taken seriously and/or considered for big movie roles like actors such as Keanu Reeves does by Hollywood. The series is funny but the DVD is way overpriced...and....sorry, Chris Kattan is funny in this series however, Keanu is a A-line star and needed to be in this series more than 5 minutes in order to keep me from fast forwarding though most it; Be warned, Keanu portrays himself in only the 1st episode for about 5 minutes."
5,Exceptionally Inspirational!,"This is a great short series that finally made it to DVD. It is quite self-aware of the flwas and difficulties of making a career in film (and in Bollywood films of course), and the theme is reflected very well throughout the story. Its combination of dance and expected storytelling works very well. Kattan surprisingly works well in this role (I say ""surprisingly"" because I am not a Kattan fan, but there is a lot of good work here). It definitely is worth watching."
2,"Good, but better books exist","This book is a nice place for women travelers to start, but the book Travel Tips for the Sophisticated Woman by Lara Vestanen has far more depth and really useful tips."
5,Perfect addition to child's room,"I purchased these wall hangings to match the Butterfly Kisses decor for my daughter's room. Since we were not able to paint our apartment, I figured these would look nice and they do."
5,A Must Read,"Having read this book I want more!Not only does it take you to places you may not want to go, but once you get there, you can't stop reading it. An excellent book, which keeps the pace flowing and completely engaging."
5,A REAL PAGE-TURNER!!!,"It's rare that a book keeps me up until 3:00AM but this one certainly did. Great insight into today's Cuba and the dramatic changes that could be unfolding just an hour's boat ride from the Florida Keys...amazing! It's superbly written and the characters are well-developed...some feel like old friends after only a few pages. A great read, timely and wonderful food-for-thought. I highly recommend it!!!"
4,Works like a charm,"Haven's used it that much yet, but when I do, it works great.And the battery has lasted for four years already (though lightly used, mind you)."
5,Katy's Review,This remote is very easy to use and requires no assembly or directions. Great product!
4,Wireless Remote Control RC1,"Supplier was prompt, courteous and helpful. The remote would be more useful if you did not have to point at front of camera only. The smallness of the product makes it more difficult to hold and use without dropping."
1,Doesn't work right,I have been using the remote with the cable which works extremly good besides that the cable is somewhat short.I'm very disappointed with this remote as it only works if the remote is very close to the camera and if it's pointed in a specific way.After just using it for a couple of times it doesn't work at all anymore. I'm not sure if it's the batteries but I would think so as I just bought it......I would not recommend this remote to anyone.
2,Do not buy,"Im 30 but I put underage so my name can be anonymous.This was a gift, but it does not work, it was delivered damaged and they did not give me another one."
2,Canon wireless remote,"This more of a comment about the retailer than the product itself. I have been unable to test the remote, because I suspect it arrived with a drained battery. The new battery will cost almost as much as the remote itself, so it sits in a drawer. I will never shop from that retailer again."
1,Batteries dead...,"Can't say if this works or not, as it was delivered with dead batteries... :-( Or at least I presume it's the batteries, and that the *whole thing* isn't dead. I'll come back and report once I've gone out and bought new batteries. Snif. Expected better from Amazon."
5,Remote,"Theres not much to say. It has a switch to select a 2 second delay or instant, and it has a clip to fasten to your camera strap."
4,Good deal,"Works just as advertised with my XTi. However some people commented about using it behind the camera, unfortunately I could never get it to work that way."
5,Great Remote,This Remote is quick and easy to use. I like the fact the it has two settings for more control.
3,Camera Timer,"I dont really know what to put here. the timer fits, and it works, I guess all I can say is it does it's job."
3,Remote,"Canon Wireless Remote Control RC1 for Digital RebelIf you are going to use this to take your own picture, make sure that you hold it discreetly, other wise it is very obviuos that you are using a remote."
5,Amazing and inexpensive remote,Don't fuss with any other remotes or wired shutter releases. This thing is awesome. It even threads through your camera strap. It's easy to use and works seamlessly with my Canon Rebel XT. A must for anyone shooting with a tripod. I highly recommend getting it.
3,You need this,"Does everything it supposes to do. All plastic and light, feels cheap. Aim toward the front of the camera and you will be ok."
5,Must have for any Rebel DSLR user,"For less than $25, you can't go wrong with this little guy. It's extremely convenient for those low shutter shots as well as perfect when you have a big group photo you need to get into.Just line up the shot, go join the group and click the button for an instant shot or a 3-second delayed shot."
4,Compatable cameras,"Grabbing one of these for myself, since I found my camera on the list, at the canon site. Here's the list, if it is of help to anyone. Or you can visit the canon site, find your camera and check the accessories list:Digital Rebel XTDigital Rebel XTiELPH 370ZEOS Digital RebelEOS Digital Rebel XT (Black)EOS Digital Rebel XT EF-S 17-85mm Lens Kit (Black)EOS Digital Rebel XT EF-S 18-55 KitEOS Digital Rebel XT EF-S 18-55mm Kit (Silver)EOS Digital Rebel XTi EF-S 18-55 KitEOS Digital Rebel XTi EF-S 18-55mm Kit (Silver)EOS ELAN 7/7EEOS Elan 7N EF 28-105mm KitEOS ELAN 7NEEOS Elan 7NE EF 28-105mm KitEOS Elan II/IIEEOS Elan IIEEOS IX LiteEOS Rebel GEOS Rebel K2EOS Rebel T2EOS Rebel T2 Date BodyEOS Rebel T2 EF 28-90mm III KitEOS Rebel TiEOS Rebel XSiEOS Rebel XSi EF-S 18-55IS KitEOS Rebel XSi EF-S 18-55mm IS Kit (Silver)EOS Rebel XSi Kit (Silver)Limited Edition Digital RebelLimited Edition Digital Rebel kit 18-55mm KitSure Shot Classic 120Sure Shot Z135Sure Shot Z90W"
3,Limited use,This product would be great if the range of the remote wasn't so short and narrow. Its not very good from any angle other than the front and at close range. It might be best to get stronger or wired remote.
4,RC1,"The device came quickly, and works as advertised. Limited to about 15 feet. Works on 5D2 and 500D. Drawback: receiving sensor is on front only! Plus: Cheap!"
5,Wireless remote for 7D,"This remote works great for quick shot and if you are close to cam, the remote will work with video recording. The small size is a plus but I am also afraid of losing it."
4,Excellent,It works great but I am hardly in front of the camera. I always have to reach over the camera.
5,"Not the cheapest solution, but probably the best","Ok, so I'll admit - the only reason I originally bought this was because I figured a Canon accessory was better than a no-name accessory that was $5 cheaper. I knew that might be a mistake, but I risked it.Turns out I was right - this risk paid off, and I'm very happy with it.The big feature that this has going for it is that it is designed from scratch to fit easily onto your camera strap, so you can always have it with the camera (and it stays there really securely).This means I don't have to worry about carrying MORE stuff with me. Anything that means I have more options when taking photos without any additional fuss is worth a few dollars.For the rest, well it does exactly what it is supposed to. It's not going to improve your photos, but it will let you do things that are hard - if not impossible - to do without a remote.Highly recommended for all levels of skill & ability. You will use this."
5,It's so little....,"I received my remote yesterday and started playing with it immediately. I could not believe how small the remote was and it came with batteries! The feature I like most is the 2-second timer. Since my Rebel XT only has a 10-second timer, this will come in handy. It also has a bulb mode setting which I will most likely use at some point. This is a great Canon product and for the price...it is worth it."
4,PRACTICAL,Practical remote although you have to catch the right angle to switch on your digital photo camera.
2,works when it wants to,ive had this product for well over a year and it pisses me off most of the time. if you arent within 4 feet of the camera you just end up clicking the button wildly 20 times until it finally goes off when your not ready. lol.. but i still use it rather than setting the timer on the camera. keeps you from walking back and forth if you are taking multiple pictures.
5,Perfect Fit,I ordered this item about a month ago and I think its great. Its tiny so you can just slip it into your camera bag or pocket. It allows for on the spot shooting or gives you a short time shot so you can get your subject in place. Its just what I needed.
4,Does what it is supposed to do!,"No surprises, it does exactly what it is supposed to do. A bit expensive (I guess one pays for the Canon Brand). I used to have the Opteka equivalent and found it less reliable.I really like the following points: solid build, nice design, the fact that it can be attached to the strap; the delay and immediate mode.I use it mostly for outdoor landscape photography and indoor studio portrait and no complaints. The only drawback is the fact that one needs to face the camera (OK from angle, but reduces the distance and definitely unusable from behind the camera, it is IR activated, not radio)."
2,OK while it works...died after 4 months,"After half an hour on tech support, a dead and worthless CR-1 sits before me as I type. You get what you pay for; and buyers ought beware that Canon offers NO support whatsoever for accessories. Best they could do was a lame suggestion that I mail the corpse to a factory in New Jersey where some guys would dork around with it.The only reason I haven't given it a bottom rating of one star is in recognition of the fact that it did work as advertised until it died. It is useful for releasing the shutter without touching the camera and it does afford a measure of freedom in getting yourself in the frame. Its range is limited, however, so you're boxed in to composing with short lenses.Bummer."
5,RCI Canon Wireless remote,RC1 Wireless remote functions as described... Connects to the camera strap so device is immediately available when needed. Paid $14 + shipping so very fare price... No buyers remorse! -Dave
4,Great accessory for your Canon SLR,Works only when pointed directly at the front of the camera. Otherwise...a great product. A must if you do not have a IS lens and want to shoot at higher focal lengths.
3,remote control shutter release canon digital rebel,"Glad I bought this product. It is worthwhile to not have to push the shutter release button on the camera and race to get into my spot in the family picture (and smile, acting calm, like I've been there all along.)I also like this alternative because it is wireless and eliminates my shaky hands from ruining the picture.However, this remote would be a lot better if I could activate it from behind or to the side of the product, instead of needing to be directly in front of the camera. In addition, I wish I could activate the shutter release while holding it in my pocket so every picture doesn't make me look like I'm switching channels on my t.v. A little more subtle would be nice."
5,Amazing,"before i bought this product i was skeptical but in the end it works as it should, loves how it straps to the belt and is small to carry.Only problem i have is that i own the Rebel XT and Cannon put the sensor in front of the camera which sucks because you have to have it pointing to the front. but not the remotes fault just cannon."
4,works well for the price,I have been using this remote for well over a year. it is a low priced but good IR remote for compatible canon cameras
5,Cool little gadget,This is really neat thing. It works really well with my Canon Rebel Xti. I have it on my camera strap and it disconnect really well when I needed it.
5,Great little tool,"When I first saw this item I thought that it couldn't possibly be worth what I paid for it, but it was! It attaches easily to your camera strap, and because it is so light it does not add to the weight of your camera. I take a lot of pictures and in the past I have rarely been in any of those photos. With this great little tool I can be a part of any photo I want!"
5,Good product,"I bought this so that we could shoot a family photo in front of the Christmas tree ... works great. I don't know what the max distance would be for this, but for most purposes, this seems to work well. You can also use it with your camera on a tripod to make sure that the shot is still (since you're not pushing a button on the camera itself). I'm sure most photographers know this, but I'm just a guy with virtually no photography skills so I'm easily impressed. For my needs, this was perfect!"
3,Great product when it works,I purchase the remote to replace an identical product that stopped working within a year. It is a wonderful product when working properly. I am hoping the first remote was a flawed unit and this one will last longer. So far so good.
3,Overpriced,It does everything it's suppose to. Just overpriced for what it is. 5 stars for function. 1 stars for price.
1,do not rely on this for important photos,"very small and clips to the strap. I liked that. It is limited as to how much control you have over the shutter and it is not dependable. I bought this to photograph fireworks this July and I'm afraid I will have to pick up another, cable style shutter release."
1,Remote Shutter Control,This remote was of very poor quality. It rarely worked. I sent it back.Canon Wireless Remote Control RC1 for Digital Rebel
1,Four monts and now its not working,"I bougth this product months ago and it works fine, but now dont work I change the batteries but nothing its dead"
1,Doesn't work,"I have to ditto the more negative comments here. Got mine and it didn't work. I figured the battery was dead. Waited too long to get a replacement battery. when I figured out the whole unit didn't work, it was past deadline to replace it."
2,Works great in a small range of situations,"This remote works well in front of the camera, if you're working with a subject. However, If you want to use it BEHIND the camera, forget it. The product description ""forgot"" to mention that fact. This product is not a replacement for a cable remote, but can be used as a companion in certain circumstances."
3,"Nice to have a remote, but....","I love having a remote for my Canon now, however it would be nice if the remote was RF (radio freguecy) instead of IR (infra-red). I don't like that I need to be right in front of the camera and aim."
4,Great tool but easily lost,"I chose this over a wired remote so I could have the flexibility to take self portraits. It works great for that and as a remote switch for my hobby (night photography). However, my one major criticism is that it lacks a lanyard loop. It is small, plastic and easy to drop and lose...especially at night! I recently dropped mine while shooting on a pier and it fell through the cracks in the boards and into the water."
5,nice investment for Canon EOS DSLR owner,I have used it a lot. For group pictures as well as night shots. Its truly value for money and serious photographers should consider buying this for un-touched night or low light snaps. As usual the price on amazon was steal.
5,Great little remote,Great little remote that works as advertised. I really like the 2 second delay feature that lets you get out o fthe way of the camera. Con is that you do have to be in the line of sight of the camera infra-red sensor.
5,great product!,This is a wonderful product. worked right out of the box (as it's supposed to) with my XSI... super cheap too!
4,"Easy Set Up, easy to Use","Purchased this as gift for my techno-impaired Dad.It came with just a single page of instructions, but that is all that was needed. I imagined having to sync this with the camera, or something goofy like that, but all you do is put the camera on the right setting and click away.Unfortunately we wont be seeing anymore stumbles as Dad rushes to get in the picture."
5,Great alternative to the 10 second timer!,"Great product! Very easy to set up and a lot of fun to be able to take continuous photos without having to reset the 10 second timer. Great alternative to the conventional use of the 10 second timer. Sometimes it doesn't trigger the shutter at any angle, but once you figure what ""works"", you'll be able to use it with no problem. Lots of fun!"
4,Canon Wireless Remote Control,"It works great, except the battery was dead when the remote control was shipped because the battery was not sealed."
4,simple and works,"This item is a good add-on to my canon DSLR. It is compact, simple and works well. The only problem is this remote control seems not very sensitive. You have to point it straight to your camera accurately, or it won't work."
3,Wireless Remote for Digital Rebel,"This remote allows you to set up the camera and take a picture without having to press the shutter release each time. I'll use it for self-portraits, pictures where I have people standing on a predetermined mark, and occasions where I can wait for the subject to enter the frame (bird watching, etc.) The remote uses the sensor on the front of the camera so use requires either line of site or can be used from the side to a certain degree but not from behind the camera. Also on my camera the remote setting is self-timer/remote so when I use the remote it actually starts the self-timer making it difficult to take spontaneous photos."
2,Doesn't work a lot of times,"My new Wireless Remote for Canon Digital doesnt work with my Rebel XT. If its slightly cold, I need to hold this thing in my hands before it gets warm and operates. If its been lying for some time, I need to press the button a lot of times before it starts responding again. And the range is too small. Barely 3-4 feet. I dont think this product is worth the money spent."
3,Great in front not for behind,I purchased this as a gift for Christmas but I tried it out to make sure it worked correctly before wrapping it. I am not overly impressed although it works well in front of the camera not that great as a remote trigger to prevent shake on a tripod when you are behind the camera.
1,Nice little remote- if it worked,"It's simple to use. I have a Canon Rebel T1i. You simply set your camera drive mode to ""Self Timer/Remote Control"", set the RC1 switch to on, and push the button to take your picture. Form factor is fine, comes with a little holder that allows you to keep the remote attached to your camera strap, bag, etc. (Which is good- it's small so could easily be lost/misplaced.)The problem: Mine doesn't work. Never did. Unfortunately, I didn't figure that out until after Amazon's return grace period. (I just didn't need it for a few weeks.) So I had to go to Canon for support. They had me test it to prove to them that it didn't work. Now I'm sending it off (I'm paying for shipping) to Canon to see if they can ""service"" it. Had I done something to it, I'd be fine with this. But since it never worked in the first place, I'm quite disappointed with the quality of the product, if not the quality control process at Canon."
1,non functioning,"Item did not work. Thought it might be the batteries, so bought new ones. No dice, just broken"
3,Canon wireless Remote Control RC1,"Good product, detection of the signal is weak from side or a distance of 20 X feet. Works great if you're in the picture, sitting in front of the camera works the best. Found it hard to be out of the picture and still have the ability to use the remote.Great shipping!"
4,I recommend it.,"I haven't had a lot of oppurtunity to really play with it yet, but I do like it a lot better than the corded one that I have for my film Canon Rebel. With the cord being about 3 feet long, it's not very ideal for some things. But, with this wireless remote, that's no problem. Also, you can set it with a delay so that you can take shots of yourself and not look like an idiot holding on the the remote :)"
3,It works,"It works really well, but it does have to be pointed DIRECTLY at the camera to be able to use it. I wish it was easier to do that with all photos, but sometimes it's hard to."
2,I can't believe I purchased this!,"I've had this remote for two years and it's already stopped working. But hey, what can I expect from an electronic controller that's under $20.00.It did work but is not very versatile. Too many times I found myself in a picture with my hand exposed and the remote visible. Also, the range is terrible, about 12' with new batteries.I'm upgrading to a more expensive version, something I should have done from the beginning. Again, we get what we pay for, if you want cheap, you get cheap."
4,good buy,i have the rebel xsi. purchased this remote to do family shots. it works great. i had an different after market remote that i lost and i'm glad i did. range is respectable on this model. do keep in mind that if using for tripod shots with slow shutter speed you need to be able to place the remote in front of the camera for it to work.
1,Didn't Work,"I received my Canon remote, but could not get it to work. Changed the batteries, checked the switches, etc. The cost of this item was so low that it was hardly worth the time and effort to return it, so it sits on my desk as a reminder to buy gadgets like this locally at a place I might actually go into semi-frequently."
2,Canon Wireless Remote Control,"Everything works fine. Except for one CRITICAL shortcoming. I'm a mountaineer and often take group shots outdoors. Sometimes the camera needs to be MORE than 16 feet from the group, because of rough terrain or desired angles. At that distance the remote would not work consistently, so I would have to walk closer to the camera to activate it. However, the remote / camera firmware replaces the 9-second countdown that the onboard camera timer has with only 2 seconds. Meaning that I have only 2 sconds to re-join the group. Forget it. I might as well just run from camera to group in 9 seconds.I think this product was designed by engineers who never use or field test their own products."
1,wierd gadget,"Got this one with wierd looking cover?Made me feel uncomfortable from the very 1st moment.I took about a dozen pictures with this gadget.Worked pretty good.Few weeks later, tried to take pictures,didn't work, tried few times, took one picture &no more.Something is definately wrong with this product.The funny looking cover is world-class design,nobody seems feel uncomfortable, not mention anybodyquestion the rational.I guess i kept it with the slide switch on position,batteries may have drained out in few week of non-use.I have no idea. Don't even know where to replace batteries.If batteries are indeed the problem, thenthe wierd looking cover should protect it fromuser's innocent mistake of leaving switch on.I think i have to buy this product againsince i have to have remote control, this product is cheap,small.Buying it again is easier than replacing batteriessince i don't know where to get them & what price."
1,Good for one day,"I was very pleased when I first received my remote. It worked as expected the first day. I went to use it a few days later and it did not work. I replaced the batteries and still did not work. I returned it right away and ordered a less expensive one which I like much better and is still working after 2 weeks, yipeeee!"
3,Doesn't work if you're behind the camera,"The wireless remote works as described. My only issue is you can only use it from the front because of the camera's sensor placement. As a landscape photographer, I spend the majority of my time behind the camera composing my image. Therefore, I have to move my hand awkwardly to the front. However, if you're looking to be in photographs and you're no more than 10 feet, it's a good buy."
3,Canon Wireless RC1 Remote for Digital SLR's,"Not what I was expecting.This little remote may be wireless, but at a cost.You have to be almost right in front of the camera for this to fire the shutter.Really disappointed that you cannot get too far away from the camera and you cannot stand behind it for this remote to work."
4,Should have bought is sooner,"Wish I bought this sooner. This is wonderful for taking photographs of yourself on trips. I had my camera for a long while, and have only rarly taken pictures of myself on my trips. I end up coming back with pictures of my wife, the scenery...but rarely myself. This remote changed it. The reason I dont give it 5 stars is that you need to be relatively close to the camera. Wish it worked from a greater distance. Also, it would have been nicer if it was radio-controlled rather than infra-red. In order for it to work, I have to stand on one side, in direct line of sight of the sensor. Not a big deal, but you have to take this into account when positioning yourself in a group."
4,Works for me,"I am glad I have this remote, but I wish it did a little more, like have a trigger type setup where I could open the shutter, and then push again to close. Other than that it is a great peice. I do a lot of night shooting at fire scenes, and using this with my tripod really helps cut down on the movement with the low light situations."
4,Canon RC1,"A cordless remote switch is useful to have if you want to be in some of your shots, in or outdoors. If you are setting up a portrait studio, and using yourself as a trial model, it is invaluable as setting the camera timer becomes a chore."
4,Works,"I like the fact that it is small weighs little and is attached to the camera strap. Kind of like a earbud though you better keep it in mind or it might get misplaced as it is small. It worked and has no wires to get in the way, nothing to plug in just set the camera and use it. Thats all I need, something that snaps the shutter. It does. I'll give it 5 stars if it works for a year. Longevity is something that takes time to observe.God bless each of you."
4,works great,"There isn't to much to say about it. the remote works just as the description states. It is great for self portrait use as well as low light use where you dont want the camera to shake by you pushing the shutter release on the camera itself. It is extremely easy to use and does exactly what it is supposed to do. the only thing that i personally think would make it better is if you could use it while your directly behind the camera, but that is not the remotes fault. I have a rebel xt and the infrared reciever is located on the front of the camera so i can only use the shutter release from the side or front. I would definetely recommend this product to any person who has an SLR and wants to explore endless possibilities that SLR's can provide that point and shoot camera's cant. I can do so many things now that i couldnt do before because of this remote"
2,"If you have nothing else to read, then maybe.","Whiting seems to have copied most of the information for his book, from unit histories. At the same time he failed to cross-check his sources leaving a book that is full of inaccurate accounts of the battle. His final statement linking the war in Vietnam and the battle for Strasbourg was the most ridiculous thing I had ever read. If you know nothing about the battle, then it could be a good starting point. Just don't believe everything you read in it."
2,"""If you know nothing of the battle, then buy this book.""","I found the book to be difficult to follow given the dearth of maps and the style of writing. I have read many battle histories but I found this book difficult to enjoy. I particularly disliked the author's social commentary throughout the book and found unsubstantiated his criticism of Eisenhower. I agree with an earlier review of this book, if you know nothing of the battle, then read this book. In hindsight, I should have looked elsewhere."
4,Hatten and Rittershoffen was an extremely vicious battle.,"In the battle of Hatten and Rittershoffen over 5000 German and American soldiers were killed wounded or missing. Over 100 destroyed tanks of both sides littered the battlefield within and surrounding the utterly pulverized villages on theNorthern Alsatian Plain along the upper Rhine River during the 12 day tank-infantry battle. This battle between the U.S 14th Armored,79th Infantryand 42nd Infantry Divisions and the German 21st Panzer, 25th Panzer Grenadier, 7th Parachute, and 47th Volks Grenadier Divisions should be the subject of exhaustive research because its received little attention from historians thus far. Dan Kneeland Grafton, Ma."
5,Operation Northwind,A detailed account of the Northwind battle. Not well known but significant. It gave details down to the battalion level and helped me track the movements of my uncle who was in one of the units involved. Thank you
2,dougv,"The cinematography is good.The film is slow moving, not well acted, and the story line is not well done. I shut it off after about 45 minutes.The girl cast as the daughter seems a little fake.I don't recommend watching it."
3,Loved the smell a long time ago...,but this just does not have the complete original smell it had back in the day. My grandma used to have this and I always put it one when I was younger. This may or may not be original or it might just be old.
2,BAH!,"Eh. Pretty disappointing. I'm a fan of swiping airline safety cards when I can from different airlines as I too enjoy the artwork on such cards. This book is well presented, but I found the content to be far too abstract. I understand that they had to avoid copyright issues and such, but it seems that the airplane safety theme has gone to waste, as half of the spreads don't appear to have anything to do with it. Maybe it will grow on me, as work like this tends to, but I found it disappointing overall."
1,AVOID at all costs!,"Like everyone else here, my wine fridge stopped working and the company was of absolutely no assistance. I think mine only worked for about 9 months before it stopped chilling. The LED light inside started making this loud, repetitive clicking noise and flashing on and off, which made things even worse. I called the company, expecting they would at least have a year warranty. Nope - 90 days. To me, that's the sign of a company who knows their product is a piece of crap that won't last.They offered to sell me a new for one I think $150, but I wasn't about to fork out more money for another unit that would probably just break again in another year. I kept this one around for awhile thinking I would try to see about fixing it, but I don't think it's even worth the trouble. This one is going in the garbage. Would give this product 0 stars if I could."
1,poor!,"I received one of these as a wedding gift last year. I recently bought some wine and went to put them in the fridge only to find that the inside of the fridge was at room temp even though it was set for 54 degrees. I found the manual and called the number. The rep said that the there was nothing they could do to fix it since it was past the 90 day warranty and that it must have malfunctioned due to a power surge. She asked me where I bought it and I said it was a gift. She then said ""well maybe the person who purchased it bought it from a place where it was sitting for a while""!!! It sounds that everyone else has had the exact same experience. Horrible customer service!"
1,Great...if it worked,"I have to concur with the other reviews of this product. Mine just died after only a year and 1/2 of use. I called to see about repair options and the company told me there's nothing they can do. Sorry, that's just unacceptable in this day and age."
1,Junk,Lasted barely one year. Company does not support it's product and provides no tech manuals or references of any kind. Company and product suck.
1,Piece of Garbage Stopped Working,"Had this hunk of junk for 5 months. After that, the light started blinking and making this annoying sound. Apparently that means the compressor is kaput. Other reviewers say PEK will not service this. What a waste of money. PEK is garbage."
1,Vino Vault - Major Lemon!,"I too have one of these beauties and it died at 1 year of age. I sent an email to their support address and received no reply. Now i started looking around and realized that i am not alone! Unfortunately, this is yet another one for the dump... How is it that companies can get away with this behavior? They should be embarrassed."
2,stoped working,"Was ok when it worked. The little argon cartridge only lasts for 3-4 bottles, and will discharge by itself if not used for a week or so. This is annoying and increases the operating costs since I ended up using up a cartridge every couple bottles. Worse, the refrigerator started humming loudly and then stopped working completely about 2 years after I bought it. There's no service available from PEK, so it's just junk now. I would avoid this one."
3,A little bit of a let down,"The item came with a huge sticker accross the whole front door. Upon removing it there was glue and residue that would not come off. Used some glue remover and it took some paint off as well. One of the fans on the back of it was also damaged and I had to replace it. I spent half a day to repaint and fix the fan just to make it functional. I called the company who said they would ship a new one under warranty. However, they did not follow through even after I sent in my reciete of purchase. I will look at other companies for future purchases."
4,A Great Collection,"If you have been listening to bright eyes since the stone ages, and are obsessed with Connor Oberst's superior songwriting, you probably want to hear everything the band has to offer. One thing about most of Bright Eyes' albums is they all have a theme or a general sound. Instead of that, the Noise Floor is comprised of songs that were not bad, but were written at the wrong time to fit into the CD that was being written at the time. Then some songs are from way back in the past, one of them even dating back to 1998. Individually the songs are great, and some of my favorites. If you love any of Bright Eye's songs you will enjoy those of this album."
5,Amazing Collection!,Great mix of rare tracks + some original tracks. I always love to hear the first version of songs and lyrics.
4,Amazon.com purchase,For the price it is a good value. My only problem is with the shipping. It arrived about a week and a half later then promised and the box it was shipped in was coming apart everywhere. The item was not damaged! The shipping box was not a good box for shipping. Too flimsy!
5,laundry cart,Very happy with this purchase. it is exactly what i was looking for. This laundry cart is exactly what you would see in a laundramat. Putting it together wasn't too bad. i figure if i can do it anybody can
4,Good home laundry cart,"I was looking for a cart under $100 on Amazon and was happy to find this one. If you are looking for a cart as big as the commercial ones at the local laundry mat - this one won't do. And expect to pay over $100 for commercial grade. But for home use, the cart is just fine for my usage. I would have given this a 5 star, accept that the basket is a little low and I am 5'1""; I really didn't want to have to bend much as the washer and dryers are on pedastals which is nice for my height. The wheels seem fine for the size and load weight and I like the chrome finish - unlike the commercial rubber finishes. Our mud/laundry room isn't finished yet, but I know this will fit in perfectly when we get around to the folding counters and such. June 28, 2012: Cart is still holding up well, with no issues with wheels, etc. Jan. 2013 cart still performing well."
1,Wheels Problem,"I am not very happy with this idem, I paid a total of $109.58 on march 1, 2009 and after 9 months 2 wheels got broken. The wheels are not very solid and impossible to fix them.Amazon return policy is 30 days. After the 30 days they pass you to whitney designs. And whitney designs is ignoring me.I will let you know if someone will help me with this problem."
5,chrome laundry cart,"service was excellent, prompt and delivery was fast!I love this cart. Wow, no more having clothes dropping to the floor from washer to dryer.If you have front loaders on pedastals I highly recommend this."
5,Wonderful gift idea!!!,"I have bought this book now as a birthday gift for my father, my husband and two of our friends (all of whom are athletes who are definitely NOT sissies!). It is such a beautiful testimony to the fact that age is just a number. I hope someday I might qualify to be in one of Etta Clark's future edition of this book."
1,Volume 1 Beginner DVD,"I just received the combo pack with DVD. Haven't tried the slant board yet. However, the DVD portion is definitely a rip off. This is the 3rd Volume 1 I have received and disc just does not want to play. I have tried playing on two computers and it still fails to perform. Volume 2, however, which I received in my first order which included both volumes - works fine. I was hoping this 3rd time around would be different."
5,Kilar's score is a horror classic.,"You can be forgiven for asking ""Who the heck is Wojciech Kilar?"" The Polish composer has only a handful of film scores to his credit. But don't let that deter you from obtaining this excellent recording. Along with Herrmann's PSYCHO and Waxman's BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, this is one of the finest horror scores ever written. Bold, atmospheric music combines with eerie voices and sound effects to create a truly terrifying and powerful experience. Like Bram Stoker's classic creation, this score is timeless."
3,It's okay.,"I'll admit I only bought it to get ""Love Song for a Vampire."" I do like the Hunter's Theme, but it, along with the rest of the score tends towards repetitiveness. The song at the end is worth the CD, though."
2,Are you people going deaf?,"This CD is horrible, with the exception of Love Song for a Vampire. That song is absolutley amazing and would be the sole reason for buying the cd. There is a definite lack of beauty and talent in this score."
4,Dracula sunk it's teeth into terror,"What can I say about the album that kept me up all night, terrorfied to look around. Aside from the Polish composer Wojciech Kilar's unspellable name, the CD is, how should I word it? Pure terror. In fact, the first track makes me feel like one of those gothic nuts who pierce everything. This is only one of a few horror movie soundtracks that, when listened to alone, evokes the same discomfort and intimidation as the images in the movie. Two truely scary tracks are THE RING OF FIRE, which uses a repetitive DING DING, like THE MURDER from PYSCHO, along with the cackling of Dracula's wives as they eat a horse. What did bring the rating down was the unpleasent repetition many of the songs utilized. This especially in track one, where Dracula's defeat of the Turks is symbolized by a serious of crashing orchestrations that seem to go on forever. In all though, the chords hit just right, making for a very uncomfortable listening experience."
5,Kilar's Music is Amazing,"The motion picture soundtrack for Bram Stoker's Dracula is one of my favorites. This film is my favorite film of all time. The power of the music just takes my breath away. Annie Lennox' song ""Love Song for a Vampire"" is my favorite song of all time. It is lovely and heart-wrenching. This is a must have for vampire lovers."
4,Fast shipping,"Fast shipping, item delivered as promised, but with small crack in the case. I would use this seller again."
5,A wonderful triumph over the travesty which was the film,"I heard this long before seeing Coppolla's film, which would explain my unrealistic expectations of the movie to come close to the beauty, foreboding and sheer terror that this C.D. can evoke on a dark night with the lights off. There is little to match it - Bram Stoker's Dracula IS the only horror soundtrack you'll ever need, despite the cloying inclusion of Annie Lennox' Love Song For A Vampire. Don't see the film - listen to this and make up your own version of Dracula in your head. It's the only way you won't be disappointed."
5,She's All Grown Up....For Real,"The Queen reigns supreme!!!! Her style on this CD is just over the top. Never would I have thought, listening to her in the early days of rap, that one day she would actually pump out a CD I would listen to over and over again. Not only do I listen to it constantly, but I have given it away as a gift to many of my friends. California Dreaming was the perfect song for me while stuck at work in a snow storm. Her range is perfect. All hail the Queen. She has ARRIVED!!!!"
5,The Queen Hits A High Note,"The Queen may be a rapper, but she has the voice of an angel. Happened to catch the Queen on the Grammy's and was blown away by the song she sang. Went out the next day and bought the CD, which is great. Want to listen to a great voice, singing some great songs, then buy this disc. I promise you won't be disappointed."
5,well done,"the Queen suprises a lot of folks with this cd composed of all singing. With a jazzy, R&B feel to it. It takes you on a trip and doesnt bring you back until the last song is over with. Its very soothing, comforting and her voice is strong when needed and subtle yet passionate on other tracks. But throughout the Dana Owens album there is one thing for sure that not only can she rap. But she can also sing as well, it doesnt feel like a gimmick or something forced. Its a natural progression and i love it. I do hope that she does another rap album in the future, but for now. I'm very happy with this effort."
3,Give me a break...5 Stars (3 stars at best),"Considering that Regina Bell and Chaka Khan both have Jazz albums out this year that are both spectacular, I don't understand how people could realistically give Latifah 5 stars for this mediocre album. The production on this album is good and she does a fair job of interpreting these songs, but her vocals are ordinary at best. I am not hating, but after listeing to a Rachelle Ferrell,Dianne Reeves or Natalie Cole album, you will see that Latifah does not have what it takes to compete with jazz royalty and definitely does not deserve 5 stars. Please be fair with your reviews. If this is a five star album, then what do you give Miles, Billie, Sarah, etc... This is 3 stars at the most."
2,Way too smoothly produced.,"Queen Latifah, Dana Owens...a singer of this caliber, with personality to spare. She deserves better than this blandly produced and arranged album. There is no grit, no ragged glory to the music. The artist front and center is wonderful. But the surroundings leave much to be desired. I have high hopes that her follow-up, ""Travelin' Light"" will fare better."
2,Disappointed!,Really not what I expected. Hello Stranger is the only song on the whole CD that I really like.
5,Amazing,"Anther amazing CD from an amazing artist, you don't have to like rap to enjoy Queen Latifah."
2,A bit disapointed,"I had heard one or two cuts from the CD on a local radio station and I was both impressed and stunned that it was the Queen's lovely voice doing justice to the classics.I was then let down when I, after hearing the whole CD, realized that the only 2 songs played on the radio were the only two worth owning.She truly butchered ""Mercy,mercy,mercy"" by adlibbing her own words to this icon of blues music. Hearing her sing ""California Dreamin"" was just painful. Had she left the lyrics and the arrangments alone on each song, she would have hit a home run. (except for ""Calif Dreamin""). Frank Sinatra used to adlib the lyrics in songs with great success. The Queen isn't Frank."
5,Fabulously Soothing!!!!,This is a new style of delivery for Queen L and IT WORKS!!!! I absolutely love this collection of vocals - it is pleasing and sets the mood for romantic interludes! You go girl!
4,I liked it.,"I'm not a big fan of rap but a friend of mine thought I should listen to this album. I was curious since it was Queen Latifah and it wasn't a rap album. I enjoyed the album, my husband didn't but I rather liked this. Sure some of the songs don't have a strong emotional feeling but I still liked a majority of the songs."
3,Disappointing,"I love Queen Latifa's voice and styling. Lush Life a track on the Dan Owens album, and is a favorite that I already had on the soundtrack to Living Out Loud. I was hoping for the whole Dana Owens Album to be more of the same, but it just didn't have the same energy and heart-wrenching soul that Lush Life had me expecting. Unfortuately, the album is basically elevator music."
2,Fair,"First of all, I'm a big fan of ""the queen""...every since her first album. I was looking forward to this CD because I knew it would exhibit a different side, but I was very disappointed. Maybe it was the song selection...not sure, but there was nothing exciting or absolutely wonderful about this CD. It was just barely ok to me. She has a nice voice, but I felt she could do even better."
4,Just short of amazing...,"I intially did not listen to too much of Queen Latifah when she rapped, just knew a few songs. For most of us our first glimpse of her voice was in Chicago. This album is great and the music is fabulous. Couple of songs didn't really do it for me, especially California Dreamin', should have left that one alone, not really the fault of her singing, just the way it was remade did not work. My favorite would have to be Lush Life. It's so beautiful, strangely similar style and tone to Natalie Cole's version (maybe those two should get together). Sometimes you forget it's Queen Latifah singing because it's just something you're not used to. Every now and then she slips a little of her attitude in there and you remember it's her and are again amazed. Hope she continues along this jazz path!"
4,Wow,"I picked this up since I have always liked Latifah - the very first CD I ever owned was one of her old albums that she did back in the late 80s with the Flavor Unit - and all I can say is that this album is a great showcase for her voice.Most other reviews mention her rendition of Al Greens' Simply Beautiful but I think the best track on this CD is Hard Times - a very emotional song sang with great passion. Pick this up, you definitely will enjoy this collection of easy listening tracks."
5,All hail the Queen (a.k.a. Dana)!,"After hearing a little taste of this great music on the Today show last week, all I can say is...You go, girl! Virtually everyone who posted their reviews so far has echoed my words, and this gal can SING!!!"
5,Incredible,"I bought this cd because of curiosity reasons. I was completely impressed with her singing. She needs to ditch the rap music and concentrate on this style of usic. I didn't want this cd to end. I wanted more, but it ended. I look forward to more of this type of music from her. I never leave home without it."
4,"you go Queen Latifah! MERCY, MERCY, MERCY!","Queen Latifah has proven herself as not only a credible rapper, but also a credible singer. Of course, this was first proven in the multiple oscar winning movie CHICAGO as her role as Moma Matron and her unforgettable song, ""WHEN YOU'RE GOOD TO MAMA"". Here, Latifah covers a full set of pop/jazz classics and does it very well. She has the smoothness of the classic jazz singers and the arrangements supporting her a very well done as well. She should've done better on the Albums Chart, but because of lackadaisical promotion, she has fared moderately. But she has one of the better standards albums of the year. Top song picks ""Baby Get Lost"", ""Simply Beautiful"" f/Al Green, ""California Dreamin'"", and ""Mercy, Mercy, Mercy"". 4 stars."
5,excellent!,"I am a huge fan of the balladeer/songstress era/jenre I've listened to most everyone and I can tell you Dana's CD fits right in with the best of them. I have always been a big fan of hers because of her multi talents, and her making this CD lends to that notion. I get thrilled when people in the business step outside of the box from time to time to explore other venues that transend their own expectations. I love it!"
3,"She can pull it off, but it's just missing something","I have been a huge fan of Queen Latifah since ""All Hail the Queen"". I also love all kinds of music, so my review is not tainted by any kind of prejudice against this genre of music - quite the contrary. My main complaint is that while Dana can sing adequately and can hold her own against many people, she is just missing the kind of vocal ability, depth, and style that allows singers to excel in this genre. This CD sounds like someone experimenting in a genre that is not their own. I think it's successful as an experiment, but doesn't have the kind of spark to make it stand on it's own among the greats of the genre.Also, some of the song choices then seem very cheesy, especially ""California Dreamin'"".I look forward to the Queen's next rap album - I think ""Black Reign"" was extremely solid, if not revolutionary, and one of the 90's best albums."
2,Should have been a winner,"After her stellar songs for the ""Living Out Loud"" soundtrack, we were all asking ""why doesn't Queen Latifah do more of this music"" because her versions of Lush Life and Be Anything were so definitive. So what a bummer this new album is. The promise has not been delivered. Her vocals are forced and undistinguished - this album is not worthy of the talent she unleashed for Living Out Loud and Chicago. Let's get those musical directors back in the driver's seat if QL is going to attempt this music again...."
5,Excellent Service,I already had this CD but a friend of mine enjoyed it and wanted to purchase it also. We tried several stores and could not find it. I went online and found it at Amazon.com and it was delivered fast and did not cost anymore than if I had purchased it at the store. I would definitly recomend Amazon.com to anyone. This is not my first nor will it be my last purchase here.
4,Soothes the Room,"95% of the reason that I bought this cd was because I watched ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" and I loved the original version of ""Something Beautiful."" I constantly rewound that part just to listen to that particular song, and when I heard Queen Latifah's version, I liked it just as much. When I heard Al Green crooing in the background, I was online to buy it immediately. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the rest of the cd is really good too. I like Queen Latifah as a rapper, but I really like her as a singer. She sings the oldies like she was right in those decades. An old soul for a young woman with a grown woman's voice. I can dig that!"
5,All Hail The Queen,"The Queen lives up to her name. With a true respect for the music Queen Latifah serves up a smoldering, delicious gumbo of tunes and makes each one her own. Simply Beautiful shines as the backbone of this collection and Al Green passes the torch with his soulful background vocals. Giving a fresh sound to California Dreamin' and making Baby Get Lost a brand new song Miss Owens has created an album that will become a classic in my musical library. Each selection has merit and because of the outstanding arrangements a pesonality comes out of every song. With so many wonderful songs out there deserving the Latifah touch I will greatly anticipate The Dana Owens Album II, III, IV and so on. All hail The Queen."
3,The Dana Owens Show,"Signed with Interscope Records, Queen Latifah better known as Dana Owens (didn't think you knew that huh?) comes out with a Chicago-esque album which I admire. I've always been a fan of the blues and she does the best that she can to prove she isn't just all about hip-hop. Though minimal marketing and promotion of the album by her label, you have to admit, curiousity kills the cat. Since the Queen is doing bigger and better things in her acting career, it was curiosity to know what she was doing with her musical career. Very good album to own and to maximize your ears into past blues musicians."
1,Nice voice gone bad.,"I have really tried to like this album. Really I did. However, the more I push myself to like it the more I find wrong with it. Don't get me wrong Ms. Owens has a great voice, I think she would do well with to cover musical theater not jazz. Also, the Hello Stranger song is great but boring. Ms. Owens offers nothing new on any of the jazz standards on the cd. The songs sound forced and there is no emotion at all to them. There is no range with her voice either, every song sounds the same.She actually butchered a few of the songs: (Lush Life and Baby Get Lost). I won't be too hard on her about Lush Life, it's a difficult song and most people butcher it (poor Billy Strayhorn). I think she should have taken the route of Ol Blue Eyes and left it alone."
2,I'm Trying to love this cd but it's hard....,"Let me say that I think Queen Latifah has an awesome voice, and with the right songs, I'd say she could easily cross over into the smooth jazz/easy listening area. But this cd ""ain't"" it. Although I was blown away by the rendition of Al Green's ""Simply Beautiful"" which the Queen and Al Green himself crooned out together, I couldn't quite digest the other selections. I believe Queen, aka, Dana Owens just needs to choose different selections and give it another try. I really believe she has the potential to create an fabulous cross over cd!"
2,ok&I Applaud Her Risk here,"say whatever you want about Queen Latifah but She is One of the Few acts from the 80's that truly can control Her Destiny.She made a Name for Herself as a Rapper. she had some Moments though Hit&Alot of Miss on the Album front. alot of People know Her more for Her Film Work which to me She does far better overall. now She is back as a Stylist with to much Polish. the Musicianship,arrangements&Production are cool,but Vocally She doesn't quite have it. if she had that It then Jill Scott would have to worry just from being a Stylist herself.I give Latifah dap for the Risk because this was a Gamble."
2,Please Let the Real Singers Do It!!,"In my honest opinion, Queen Latifah should definitely leave singing to professionals: aka... someone who has years of study in jazz vocals or musical theatre. No direct attack on her personally, but I see no reason why her celebrity status should outweigh the vast talent that other unknown singers have over her when it comes to publishing a CD. I thought that she had a lot of soul in her singing, but she just doesn't compare to hardcore jazz/broadway style vocalists."
5,Even kids appreciate good music,"As a 13 y.o. boy I should be listening to rap or hardcore, but because my parents exposed me to many types of music I was allowed to experience a great CD by a Queen. Mama Cass may have dreamed of California, but Queen is creating dreams of California for the youth of today. Pop, jazz or the blues this Lady could help my generation climb out of the rap rut and learn to love the great music of yesterday being reinvented by the artists of today."
5,Queen Reigns Supreme,I am living inside this CD daily. I cannot stop playing it over and over and over and...
4,The Queen Reigns Supreme!,"At first, when I bought this album, it took some time to get used to it. But after I had the chance to actually sit down and relax and take a listen, it grew on me tremendously! I always knew the Queen could 'blow' but I had no idea she was on this type of level! My two favorite songs on this CD are 'Hard Times' and 'Hello Stranger'. I could listen to this CD five times a day!"
5,It's a crime...,"To have such a wonderful voice and hide it from the world for all these years and do rap instead. Rap is fine but to me, those who can't sing, rap but this woman can sing her butt off. Excellent CD, best one I've bought in a long time."
5,Deluxe Dana,"I expected this album to be good, but I was blown away by it. As my wife said, ""Wow, she can sing!"" The Queen has a wonderful voice, and a lyrical sense that you'd never guess from her usual style. I like her somewhat slower, dreamy version of ""California Dreamin'"" much better than the original. Being a Coltrane fan I never thought I'd like a vocal version of ""Lush Life,"" but I've changed my mind. Hers is dynamite, and somewhat reminiscent of Billie Holiday.Add to her voice and style some nice orchestrations and small group arrangements, and a good mix of pop and standards, and you have a candidate for Album of the Year. Let's hope the Queen does more of these.Now if I could only get the CD back from my wife...."
4,Easy Listening,I purchased this CD because I heard Hello Stranger on a Jazz station. I loved it when I heard it and had to know who sang it. It was Queen Latifah. I went to Amazon.com to hear the rest of the songs on that album. I recognized a few such as California Dreamin and Moodys Mood. They are my favorite. I keep it in my car and when I am stuck in traffic and want to hear something that will relax me I put it on. I recommend to anyone who is looking for some romantic music also.
4,one of noble price winner Kawabata's best,"A both lovely and disturbing novel, giving us conflicting aspects of the human condition. A very satisfying read, providing insights into the beauty (and sadness?) of Japanese culture."
2,MEh- it rattles,like the title says. it rattles and is annoying. it distorts the sound to much to be of much use. i recomend getting one of the rubber mutes. this is a beautiful mute but utterly worthless.
1,This is a HORRIBLE cd case!,"I am used to the good quality Case Logic CD cases, so when I got one of these, logically, I was very disapointed. For starters the Cd case dosen't even stay open. Its like there is an elastic trying to close it while I am trying to find the right Cd amongst the flimsy little sleves that fall out of the case all the time. To top it all off they are individual, which means it is twice as hard to find the right cd. Can you imagine trying to find one cd in a messy stack of 72? The corners of the inside sleves are made of plastic that feels like it is sharp on the corners. The ""Spiral"" they are on doesnt do its job which is supposed to make it easy to flip through the sleves. When I try to flip one, it always pulls a few more with it. then pops back to where it was. This is a very frustrating Cd case. I would not recomend it. Go with Case Logic. In my opinion they are the best. Thank you for taking your time to read this. I hope it will help you choose the right Cd case."
4,I like it,"This cd case is worth the money. I was surprised to get it and find an outer pocket and an inner net pocket as well. Its also nice looking, if that sort of thing appeals to you. The cds stay in place, thats what counts."
1,CD Carrying case,I bought this product from Wal-Mart and I loved how it looked but once I used it for maybe 3 days I hated it. The little sleeves keep falling out and it is just a big mess. I don't reccommend it.
3,A good goth/doom sampler.,"For those of you wondering who is who in the world of goth/doom (or whatever it goes by today!) music. This sampler gives you a quick primer. Some of these songs are very good and others...not so good. I like the variety here, from the eerily haunting punishment of ""Cradle of Filth"" to the sirens wailing of ""Dismal Euphony"" this CD has it. The strangest track has to be by ""Him"". A retro 1980's glam-rock sound singing about his lovers ""sweet 666"". All in all, this is a great CD to pop in when you are feeling kind of evil. Light the candles and incense experience Beauty in Darkness."
3,Decent compilation...,"There are no thoroughly impressive songs on here, but nothing that deserves to be in the wastebasket either. The best song is Cradle's ""Cruelty Brought Thee Orchids,"" which I had already heard on their Cruelty & The Beast album. The tracks by Godgory and Crematory are pretty good, the Liv Kristine track is totally out of place, and the tracks by My Dying Bride and Dismal Euphony, bands I'd heard many good things about, were thoroughly disappointing. Heck, someone compared Dismal Euphony to Tristania once - don't EVER blaspheme against the lords of gothic metal like that! The song by HIM is laughable; this band makes pop music and, like Liv Kristine, don't belong on a metal collection. The rest are just okay. Nothing to write home about."
2,Sporatic security coverage,"This book was more like a bunch of short articles. Nothing was sufficiently fleshed out, and it certainly wasn't cohesive enough to allow you to secure a machine. If you happened to want to do exactly one of the things they cover, then you're all right. Else, you have this feeling that you've secured your machine when in fact you have many gaping holes still left in your system.If you want to really learn how to secure your machine, I instead recommend Hacking Linux Exposed 2nd edition or Real World Linux Security."
2,Not up to par,"I've been reading ""Linux Security Cookbook"". I fully understand the goal of this book is to provide lots of little bits of wisdom, not a full fledged security book. I think that's pretty cool. However I'm finding that a lot of the recipies, if you will, are either not well explained, the equivalent of reading a real cookbook witohut knowing what it means ot 'fold the blueberries into the batter'. They could easily have spent more time explaining things so we didn't need to go read/re-reading the man pages just to understand the book."
5,A very informative book about ET from a Christian viewpoint,Hitchcock provides a very informative look at the phenomenon of ET visits to Earth and gives a clear view of who ET really is. Extensive attention is paid to Biblical references and a logical approach is used to state that ET is a threat and is demonic in nature. Numerous references were used to make a scientific subject very clear to an asthetic Bible student like myself. Very easy to comprehend and a fascinating read. Worth reading and should be a must for everyone!
5,I couldn't put it down,I read this book in 24 hours. This is a fascinating book about the possible nature and purpose of UFOs and aliens. A good mix of science and biblical accounts and explainations makes this an important addition to your library. It will hold your attention throughout. I highly recommend it.
5,customer review,"This CD has a great meassage to the world we live in. The music and songs has a message to everyone and it sonds great. Every person in the U.S. should have a copy of this CD. I have met the Executive Producer Gwen and she is a wonderful person who enjoy writing music to help people to understand God word. The Artist that is singing in the CD sonds wonderful; I really enjoy this CD. God blessing to this CD. Thank You, Ms. Gwen for making this CD. Love to you and Your Family. Jeanette"
5,Touching (very tender),The song is very moving. It moved me emotionally to tears. You could just close your eyes and experience the deep call to God to help us. I highly recommend this CD for all of America. Very moving and real.
5,Inspiring!,This is an absolutely beautiful song - I find it stuck in my head a lot! The lyrics are a great testament to our Lord!
3,THIS ALBUM IS AMAZINGLY 3 Stars,"this album is not five stars. the album has good variety, and three damn good songs, but the rest of the album is thrown into the categorie of uncreative country rock. Blake Sennett's guitar work is, as always, superb, and the overall album is good, but five stars, dont be ridiculous."
5,Top 5 of the year!,"Just go buy it. This is definitely one of my top 5 albums of '04. If you like Death Cab for Cutie, The Thrills, Beck (Sea Change) or Travis you will love this album!"
3,Not as good as the PS2 version,"This is not a bad game, but I expected it to be more like the PS2 version.Since the DS does not have as powerful a processor, I should have guessed it would be scaled down.Still good, fun to play. But different play style. For a low price, still worth the time to play."
5,"great book, poor printing quality","I have always loved this book, and recently ordered a new hardbound copy for my three children. When I received it, I was surprised at the markedly poor paper quality and the poor saturation of both the pictures and the script on the facing pages. Yes, the illustrations are watercolor, that is not what I mean. The ink and just the overall print quality are cheap-seeming. Near the copyright it states ""printed in (third world nation)"". To those of us who remember when t-shirts were union-made domestically and didn't fall apart after five washings, this seems like part of an overall trend.But the book is still wonderful, worth buying. I am considering ordering copies from the UK amazon site for my relatives, Europeans seem a bit smarter about keeping up printing and other manufacturing standards.Similar problem with ""The Tomten"", even in the hardbound edition."
2,Poor quality,"We have checked this book out from a local library and fell in love with sweet illustrations. I ordered it from Amazon and am EXTREMELY disappointed with the quality of this book: the illustrations are much duller than in our library copy and they look very grainy and blotchy, on some pages it looks as if the pictures were done on a cheap printer that leaked blue ink - with specks and streaks all over :(If I hadn't promised my kids to get our own copy and they weren't expecting it, I'd send it back right away.Amazon delivery was super fast though: I ordered it yesterday and found it on my doorstep today, that's why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one.I guess I'm off to ebay, to find an earlier (and better quality) printing.(This one states ""Manufactured in China"", while our library copy was ""Printed in Canada"")"
4,Charming and simple,"For years my mother used to read The Tomten, by Astrid Lindgren to her elementary school classes, and they loved it. When she retired, she gave the book to my family. My children fell in love with the book as well, and attributed all things unexplainable in our house to the Tomten. My husband, especially loved the book and declared it as one of his all time favorites. When I found that there were more Tomten books, my children ordered this one to give to their father this Christmas. He was delighted! While the verbage is simple and repetitive, the children listen and laugh while we read it. The real beauty and fantasy is in the artwork, which makes the book memorable. You will find that you embellish the story in your mind, long after the reading is finished. The plot is sweet and charming, and sure to become a family favorite to read every winter!"
5,Wonderful children's bedtime story,"The soft, lyrical text combines with the beautiful artwork to make a terrific book to read to children as they drift off to sleep. My three children all ask for this book over and over again!"
3,Sweet stories,We bought a couple of Tomten stories and they are sweet but they are very stort and I thought a bit pricey for the actual book you getI love the author and her scandinavian influence but the price is a bit high for such short stories
5,Excellent Book!!,This is a darling story to read to your children. I love the illustrations and it is a perfect book to read to my grandson. Thanks so much!! Fast and free shipping.Cgnomy from New York
5,A Great Deal,"The Canon SLR Custom Acessary Pack is a fabulous deal for what comes inside it. For only 19.99, you get a lens cover, which protected my lens when my camera was hit, cleaning supplies for the lens, and two batteries. IT's a great deal and I recomend it to anyone with the appropriate camera!"
3,Sound Quality Warning,"I am a Battle fan. That being said, I think it fair to warn those listeners who are accustomed to high quality recording, that the sound on this cd is disappointing. High notes are somewhat shrill, and the overall recording sounds muffled. And for those of us who dont particularly relish live recording, the not too infrequent coughs, dings and asstd sounds from the audience are distracting."
4,This Tom Morris is not the public philosopher.,"I have direct personal knowledge that this Tom Morris is not the same person as the philosopher who wrote TRUE SUCCESS and IF ARISTOTLE RAN GENERAL MOTORS, as well as the recent PHILOSOPHY FOR DUMMIES. I don't want philosophical audiences around the country to be confused! Note: I had to pick a star rating just to get this notice posted. I have not had the chance to read the other Tom's books, but awarded him 4 stars as a homonymous courtesy (I wonder if the Old Tom Morris would award me a good golf score just for old name's sake?)"
2,Not a good product,The Item was worth the price but I wouldn't recommend it. It didn't fit my medium size dog. However he decided he would rather eat it than wear it.
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,"This costume did not fit my dog, and the company won't let me return it because I opened it. How else would I know if it fits? The packaging bag has snaps, like any other product that would be tried on. Unless you are 100% sure this will fit, DON'T BUY IT. NO refund......this is a total gamble. I was duped!"
2,"Cute, but runs small","This costume is cute, but it runs small. My dog is only 24 pounds and it really doesn't come up over his head at all. It's easy enough to get on him, but slips around a lot. He probably won't wear it for Halloween after all, but for the price it was cute enough to at least get a couple of funny pictures."
3,Dog Halloween Costume,Received in a timely manner. Cute. The top hood did not stay up so the dog just wore it around it's neck like a collar. Might have been a bit small for a 28 lb. dog.
3,It a cute costume.,I bought this for my dog to wear for halloween. Its a cute costume it even has a place where you can slide the leash into it so it would look bad going under the costume. My dog didnt mind it she just had to figure out she could move in it. The min thing I hate was that thr hrad wouldnt stay up
1,Item not received,"This order was canceled with no explanation. I did receive my money back, but a reason for the cancellation would have been nice."
2,I'm having trouble keeping the costume securely in place. The velcro belts are not enough to keep the costume on my dog.,"The costume is very cute but is quite difficult to keep straight on my dog's body. The velcro belts on the costume are not enough to keep it securely in place. I purchased a dinosaur costume last year and it worked well because the costume was designed with legs as well, not just belts."
2,small dog for a medium size,I have a miniature jack russell and ordered the medium size. It was wayyyyyyy too small and there was no way it would fit this dog of 12 lbs. The item was fun but because of the sizing we were not able to fit it... It will be re gifted to a tiny teeny dog owner sometime in the future I guess??
3,Costume runs small,I measured and this barely fits my little girl. It will work but it's actually a little too small.I'd send it back but it was on sale and the postage would cost more than the refund. It IS cute though. It will work but the tail part is way way too short. I'll have to make some adaptations...
3,It's Alright,"I have a b/w 6 month old Corgi that I wanted to dress up for Halloween. I thought this would look adorable on him so I ordered. After all, it was only $14. The sizing on these is kind of strange. I found there were a few things I didn't think about when ordering this product.1) The headpiece section forces the dogs ears to lay back and don't allow them to pop through. To fix this I cut the ears off and then pushed my dogs ears through the holes I made. This also helps hold the head portion in the correct position.2) If you're dogs tail is longer there is no place for it to go/hide. So you end up having a skunk with two tails. Given the picture, I thought the tail was hidden away in the skunk tail section.It was an OK buy. I got some really funny pictures, but I probably won't buy a costume again. They just don't really put much thought into designing these. Best of luck buying."
2,Sub-Standard,"Costume is cute, however it only has a few pieces of elastic sown in to stay on, the end result is that it doesn't. It slides off after 5 minutes of your pet walking around."
1,Not too happy!,"I ordered this for my miniature schnauzer for Halloween. The head part doesn't stay on and it constantly moves-not a good choice, but it was cute when he was completely still."
5,Outstanding,"In the interest of full disclosure, I only discovered this artist while watching an A&E adaption of William Boyd's book, Armadillo. I spent the entire movie wondering where did the wonderful music come from and later discovered Habib Koite on a list of music from the music.I immediately bought the disk and think it is outstanding. It flows extremely well, is interesting without being instrusive and I will probably be listening to it for years to come.I highly recommend it to anyone who likes unusual music, or just wants to get into modern African music. 5 big stars."
4,stevebrigham really thinks this is good and that's good unuf,"for those looking for relaxing, hip roots music, give this a shot.."
1,Old debate,"Free (cheap) grace, or the carnal Christian, is simply a horrible unbiblical doctrine. A demonic lie straight from the pit of hell. It fails under biblical exegesis (as John MacArthur's ""The Gospel According to Jesus demonstrated) and is only supported by those who 1. Have children who say they are believers and live ungodly, or 2. they themselves have no intention of taking up their cross and thereby clearly showing they do not have authentic faith. These people have emotional presuppositions invested towards easy believism and sadly will stand before the Lord of Glory only to hear, ""Not everyone who says to me 'Lord, Lord' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he ho does the will of my Father in heaven"" ""I will declare to them, 'Depart from Me, I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness. Everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock""(Matt 7:21-24)."
1,Absolutely free of logic and scholarship,"Zane Hodges attacks the Word of God and those who hold to the true message of salvation with heated rhetoric and laughable ""logic."" It is sad that so many are accepting his watered-down gospel and the easy-believism that is completely insufficient for salvation. In every case in which the Bible indicates the necessity of obedience as the fruit of true salvation, Mr. Hodges inevitably begs the question at stake. He always confuses the results of salvation with the requirements for salvation and uses a completely malformed argument to ""prove"" his point. This book promotes a dangerous heresy and will surely lead its believers astray."
1,Not meant for the scholarly,"This is absolutely NOT the book you want if you're looking for a thorough and scholarly discussion of the biblical arguments, for and against, Lordship Salvation. Worse, however, is that the logic is flawed in several instances leaving the reader wondering if this is truly the best ""reply"" available."
5,Outstanding defense of the gospel of grace. A must read.,"I really like this book. Zane Hodges covers most of the so-called NT problem texts dealing with assurance, eternal security, perseverance, saving faith, and repentance. It is a very thought provoking and helpful response to Lordship Salvation"
3,Kadrey,"It's good, but i read the Sandman Slim stuff first and my be a bit biased that way. Still a good read."
5,superb,"the weather station is beautiful, arrived timely and in perfect condition; it was a gift and sits among many other favorites on the desk.great looking and works too....."
2,Don't order Fruit of the Loom,The shirt is suppose to be heavyweight. It isn't. It's not a soft material either. I ordered a medium and after one wash in cold water/gentle spin the shirt has shrunk. The only thing right about the shirt is the color.
3,Buyer Beware,A 6X Shirt has a funny way of turning into an XL after 2 washings. I wasn't that impressed with the quality.
2,The Deal Rack Fruit Loom 5.4 oz Heavy Cotton T-shirt,"The shipping was fast but that's about it. There was NO packaging-a white T dropped in a shipper with no tags, bag or other identifier to show that it is new. I could have bought it at the thrift shop this way. The cotton is thinner than all the t-shirts I own even though it's called ""heavy cotton"". The shirt itself is tagged not the new style with a stamped tag. There's not enough time to return before Christmas. I will not buy from The Deal Rack again."
2,Cut too small.,"The material is nice, but the shirt is cut too small. Order a larger size than you think you should."
3,"Nice shirt, but the sizing is off","I am really happy with the quality and look of the material, but the Small size is too small for me. If you generally fit snugly into Small shirts, consider getting a Medium."
2,t-shirt !!!,"Hi,I buy lots of t-shirts from Think Geek - the thickness of the fabric you get there is gr8. I found the material thin.regards."
5,Totally awesome!,"The first time I heard Better Days, I knew it was Johnny and the Goo Goo Dolls, this song is moving and beautiful. The refreshing thing about the Goo Goo Dolls' music is, you can actually understand the words to the songs. Job well done guys, I can't wait for this album. Once again, you did not dissapoint! Johnny's voice is fabulous."
2,2.5-Blander than Iceberg Lettuce,"I love the Goos, however I can only recommend this single only to diehard Goo fans. I don't expect Johnny and the boys to put out an album like Hold Me Up, Superstar Carwash, or even A Boy Named Goo, but it seems like they've lost their rocker souls and have settled for being banal adult contemporary (ac) musicians. Better Days lacks the passion, grit, and ingenuity of past songs like Name, Flattop, We are The Normal, Iris, and Two Days in February. Better Days sounds like the usual sappy drivel produced by ac musicians like Kelly Clarkson, Ryan Cabrera, and Howie Day.The Goos might be pushing 40 but they can rock harder and produce better music than this. Look at The Rolling Stones. Although overrated in my opinion they still know how to rock out."
1,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,For a group that exudes such passion in their music (LIVE FROM BUFFALO anybody?) this song is like a funeral dirge. I can only hope that they haven't released the full album because they are trying to rekindle the passion that has made them the fan-favorite that they are.Take your time guys - let's get your BEST work.T.
2,Goo Goo sell out,"I've been a fan of the GGDs since the late eighties and was hoping that they would get back to their roots and start making great garage rock again but it seems they are just too old and now care more about sales instead of where they came from.It's sad to see this happen to a good band, maybe they should talk to Trent Reznor and see how a 40 yr old guy can still rock!"
2,costume Trollz TM Onyx,"Costume was torn when it arrived and had to be repaired. I sew, so I did it myself."
2,Trite and slight - with glimmerings,"I cannot help but agree with all the remarks already made regarding this very slight tale. Julius, Lord Claredon and Victoria Mallory are too much the caricatures, the cardboard cutouts, to be anything much more than irritating. He is more interesting than her by a whisker. Her petulance is just too much. A nice juicy murder with her as victim? There is a good deal of charm in the author's writing, and her stories are often entertaining. Alas not here."
1,predictable,"Yet another regency with a rake who is obsessed by a wife who is a shrew and vastly immature. There is no earthly reason why Lord Claredon, Julius, would find Victoria mallory attractive. Her personality fails on all accounts. Debbie Raleigh takes great pains to paint a vivid picture of all the attractive physical qualities of Julius. And also lets the reader in on why perhaps Victoria is such a managing female. But no rake of Julius's stamp would take Victoria barring him from the marriage bed. Pages of the story are devoted to Julius lusting after his wife, going crazy at the sway of her walk. How stupid. Again, her personality, her over the top poor treatment of him lends the reader to ask what in the world would he find attractive about her to begin with? She is not an incredible beauty, he notes. Just a silly ploy by the writer to keep her heroine a virgin."
3,"Handles its job, but less expensive alternatives out there","A plunger is a plunger, but it is nice to have the dirty, rubber head covered when not in use, especially with a crawling baby in the house.This plunger works well and is nice to look at, but I found 1/2 price alternatives for our other bathrooms at the local Lowes that provide the same functionality and non-use coverage."
5,excellent product,"The toilet plunger looks great in my parents redesigned bathroom...it actually adds to the polished finish of it. Oxo products can't be beat.The villeroy and boch toilet color is mauve, and this putty seems to transform to the color of the mauve when placed alongside it.We got the matching toilet scrubber which also sits alongside the toilet. (also highly recommended)As far as function goes: the toilet plunger functions as any other plunger. And the scrubber is exceptionally good.Both the toilet plunger and the scrubber last a long time (I have had the white ones in my own bathroom for 5 years now, still look brand new.)"
4,Good times.,"This is a very nice mix, I have used it at several parties and it has been a great hit. The only thing that would have been nice is if the songs were actual tracks as opposed to one giant track. This would make mixing so much easier. Overall great album."
5,The Best Book from China,"This is the best book I've ever read. Yu Hua is a master literary craftsman. His books have been bestsellers in China for more than a decade and have been translated into many languages. Now, finally his Chronicle of a Blood Merchant appears in English for the first time along with his first novel, To Live. The story chronicles the vicissitudes of an ordinary Chinese man living a life of quiet - and not so quiet - desperation. He struggles to overcome his chronic poverty by selling his blood to the local hospital, enabling him to overcome one finacial crisis after another. The story sweeps the reader away and drops him right smack into the middle of the Chinese countryside. We not only see the intricacies of Chinese society but the genesis of China's modern AIDS crisis. A masterful tour de force - 5 stars!"
1,Astonishingly overrated.,"I'm dumbfounded by the blurbs and positive reviews. Some people can blame the translation, but that doesn't change the issue that the characters are poorly developed, unsympathetic, uninteresting and that the novel itself is constructed like an amateur outline. Minor characters appear and reappear inorganically solely to cause a problem that the leads then solve in ham-handed ways. Not remotely suspenseful or insightful. This is a remarkably simplistic view of an incredibly tumultuous and fascinating period in both Chinese and world history."
2,Smaller than expected,"My 3 yr. old and 5 yr. old LOVE Bob the Builder so I pre-ordered this one! I was a little disappointed. Including the insides of the front and back cover this book only has 5 pages (10 sides)(the book is only about 6inches x 4inches).Each page has one pop-up figure which I have to say the kids loved but each page only had one sentence followed with ""can we fix it, yes we can"", etc. I was just a little disappointed. It took us about 2 minutes to read and do the ""pop-ups"". They haven't picked it up again since. I'd save the money for a bigger and better book!"
3,Beloved Bob is disappointing,"My granddaughter LOVES Bob the Builder, so I thought this would be the perfect book. She and I were both disappointed. Only five pages and no real story text - just isolated pictures with mundane text. Come on Bob. You can do it! How about making improvements with your book(s)."
3,A board book with sturdy pop-ups.,"BOB'S BUSY DAY has only five two-page spreads, so be prepared to talk about the pictures in addition to reading. It has pop-ups AND lift-the-flaps for little hands. The text is kind of [boring]. But the cute pictures are really colorful, and kids will love to turn the pop-up pages and lift the flaps again and again -- esp. fans of the show who are familiar with the characters. I recommend this book for one-on-one reading aloud, and then for the kids to sit alone with the book, lifting the flaps."
2,Not broad enough,"This book isn't bad for a reference if you have others, but don't study only from this reference. Topics such as spiral curves, grade staking, and several others are NOT covered NEARLY to the extent necessary to prepare you for the surveying portion of the exam (although I passed because I also used a binder somebody loaned me containing their notes from a review class)...Start here, maybe, but don't stop here."
1,Not worth the time...The book price tells it all...,"I'm completely disappointed with the book. Everything is so superficial and at times not very well explained. The example problems also do not contain a detailed step-by-step solution, which at times can be very frustrating. The book lacks dedication and hard work from the author and appeals more like a ""get rich quick"" scheme type of work."
1,THIS BOOK WILL NOT PREPARE YOU FOR THIS EXAM,"I used this book as well as it's companion ""practice exam"" as a study guide for the California Special Surveying Exam and was SOARLY disappointed by how useless it was. The level of difficulty of the actual exam far surpasses ANY information this book provides or prepares you for. If you have NEVER taken a surveying class in your life, this book is good for introducing you to the subject but should be followed up with a practical surveying reference. It has no index and proves completely useless as a reference to use during the exam. Don't be misled by it's being marketed as a review for the exam because it is NOT."
1,Don't waste your money,Totally inadequate for the California Surveying examination. The 3 chapters in Civil Engineering Reference Manual by Lindeburg covers more surveying than this entire book. A real surveying book or review course is required. This book is a rip-off.
2,Too simple for CA Civil PE Surveying Special Exam,"I used this resource, with the other 2 companion books, as my only resource the first time I took the California Civil PE Surveying Special Exam. I took the PPI 1 day review class for surveying. I failed the exam miserably.These materials are fine if you use them in addition to other resources.I recommend using Mansour at [..].I didn't take his review class, but just using the review materials - which I borrowed from a colleague - enabled me to pass."
5,Love it!,"I used this book to study for the April 2009 PE exam, and I passed the first time. This is much more helpful than the bigger PE study guides that only have short sections on Surveying. This book is still small and has an easy learning curve. I highly recommend this book to study for the PE."
3,too simple,"If you don't know ANYTHING in Latvian, book is for you. If you know something already a bit, don't waste your money.For example, in page 109 (phrases page) are 30 words!!! 15 Latvian and 15 English (9 sentences).You can take this book if you are going to visit Latvia for 1st time, and would like to learn ""Hello, how are you?"" in Latvian.If you speak English, then you want to know words in Latvian. So, for example, with letter ""d"" there are like 115 words in English only..This book should be called ""Your first 10 sentences in Latvian"", ""...book for tourists"". Not dictionary..."
5,Very good!,"So why I am reviewing this is because... I really wanted to learn Latvian, and so my mom got this for me, and I was really excited when I got it! I think it's great, I take it to different places with me (School, events which take forever to end and end up being no fun at all, etc.) and it's so awesome because it is small and quite portable compared to the other books around. The pronunciations are described very well and are quite easy to understand, the dictionary is good, and the phrasebook part is also quite helpful. It doesn't include the non-basic things such as ""There is a platypus in my bathtub"" and other things that are uncommon phrases (Obviously), but it does have many good things you'll need to know as for whether you're just learning it (Like I am) Or learning for another specific reason (jobs, a trip, etc.) So... I think it's really helpful!"
4,A book written from the heart,"This book follow what I have done, the sungazing aventure, the love for the sun awakened by this ancient technique brought to our times by Hira Ratan Manek.This guy in ""The Eart was flat"" talks about his experience in the sungazing, his victories, his struggles and his feelings each day, week and month of this beautiful practice. Inspiring book, if you are practicing sungazing this book will be of much help, a perfect companion for your practice. Many practical suggesion from a wise soul."
4,Legacy is it right for you?,"It's been 2 days since I installed and tuned two 12 inch Legacy subs; they are in a sealed box with plenty of air room, hooked up to a matching Legacy Blue Diamond two channel amp. These are not street pounding trunk rattling sub, as the gain on my amp is adjusted properly and these two 12's hit lighter than one Cerwin Vega 12' (I had previously). For the price though they do add enough bass to piss off your girl friend in the car, and make you deaf. If your looking for something with more of a drop sound which doesn't miss a single beat these are not for you, however if your looking to add some good quality bass that complements your stereo and doesn't over power everything then these are just right for the price. I am happy with the price (about 38.00 each) and the sound is about average for a cheap set of Rockfords."
4,Very Good,"A good record, definitely worth checking out. Sharp vocals, excellent musicians, and great composition. Power/prog for the next millenium."
2,The Computer Disconnection,"Some quick facts:This is not a ""neglected, underrated gem"".This is not Alfred Bester at his best.This is not a novel. In the technical sense of the word it is, but actually this one craves to be a comic storyline, KA-BOOM! and SPLORSH! waving to the poor reader from every page, every paragraph.The last review on Amazon for the Computer Connection being more than 2 1/2 years ago clearly indicates this book is heading into oblivion. Let it rest there forever and if you really want to read something by Alfred Bester, try ""The Stars My Destination"", written in the 1950's but feeling much fresher and less dated."
5,Very heavy but works great,"Got a defective unit but they replaced it with the new one quickly. The new one works great. I shipped to Europe (it was pricey) it works great with new rice cooker and iron great.Step down functions work great.Recommend!I have decided to update my review since I received a few comments about the product I boughtFirsly, I bought it for my Parents who live in the country with 220v appliances. he maximum Watt appliance it wax tested with is 1600W. There was another appliance they used it, iron 1200W.My guess it should work fine with any other household appliance.Any issues we came across were-shipping costs, it was very heavy, and costed me around hundred usdI don't remember the exact weight smth around 20 poundsIf yiu have the nymber, plse, let me know- the fuses in the house burnt , they had to replace them a couple times"
5,croc shops best cd yet!,"wow- i always liked these guys but this cd really sounds like their best one yet - production values are at an all time high with electronica-industrial songs like: ""seless""& ""ore""... i cant wait for more from these reptiles!!!!"
1,Won't run. Crashes to desktop,"I have a fairly new computer, with display drivers that have run all other games I've loaded. Dead Man's Hand appeared to load properly, but then when I try to start the game, it crashes to the desktop. I've spent a lot of time with the ReadMe file, and with various online resources, including the manufacturer's troubleshooting web page, but still can't make the game work. If you are a computer whiz, you might risk buying this game, but if you are an average fellow who likes PC games but hasn't spent his life as a computer geek, you are advised to avoid this game."
5,The Best!,This is one of the best sci fi animes out there and the colour transfer and quality of the DVD picture is smoking! The storyline seems better than the first season but I didn't really like how the two disc stick on top of each other! Other than that everything else is fine.
5,Life for today.,"It is with great pleasure and a sense of awe that I recommend this book. I read it and remembered listening to some of the sermons, while other sermons or songs were new to me. I thank God for Bishop Monroe R. Saunders, Sr. who was my pastor prior to his death. He was a very present help in a time of trouble. This book is an excellent read for encouragement, enlightenment and greater understanding of the Bible. I think the words will stimulate your spirit to rediscover the Bible. Great expectations to answered prayer are awaiting you if make time to read the pages. Your spirit will be awakened with new life after reading this book."
2,Well written but boring,The book was well written but I found the story to be boring. Not so bad that I did not finish it but not so good that I stayed up late reading.
1,"sister, sister",The first story drained me. The author wrote it well. This book didn't get my full attention.
2,I don't like novellas,"I haven't read this book so I really couldn't just give it a one. So I gave it a two instead just to be a little fair. But I don't like novellas cause they are too short, and they really don't have a story line to them. I have at least 5 or 6 of these types of books, and I stopped reading them. Not only that, but Donna Hill has disappointed me in her books these days. I read all of her books, and after I read her book ""Soul to Soul"". I was SOOOOOOOO upset, cause she's a very good author, but that one was horrible. Her latest one is not very good either. Janice Sims, and Carmen Green started slacking off too in their writings."
3,Covers changes between .NET and VB 6,"Craid Utley has created a unique book that is squarely targeted at existing Visual Basic 6 programmers. This book focuses on bridging the gap between VB6 and VB .NET, and covers the major changes with examples.Unfortunately, most of those examples are not of the explanative how-to variety.This book won?t teach you how to program in VB .NET, or even how to be a better VB programmer. It is a guide covering what?s new in VB .NET.On the plus side, it does give one of the best (in layman?s terms) definition of .NET I have seen yet."
2,Similar or identical to Blake and Hollister,"These are a good value for money, but not more. The construction is adequate, the design pedestrian, and the collars curel up rapidly after washing.I am nearly certain that these are an offshoot of Blake and Hollister. Some models are good, some are horrible. This is just fair.I would also beware of the exceptionally high rankings of other reviews. Note that they review nothing but these makes of shirts and are all positive, an indication that they are not all genuine reviews but have been placed here to influence buyers."
3,Runs huge,The mediums run somewhere between extra large and large... After a few very hot washes it's kind of a large medium.
4,Product is very nice and excellent,"Soon after I got a 7 such kind. Soon after they arrived, I picked this one and used it. The very next day I washed this one to see if it shrinks or not. LUCKY, I was happy to see that it did not shrink. Only concern I have is the buttons, They are small and might become loose after some time .. Lets see how it goes , But worth of a 5-6$ price target.Pro'sa) Damn Cheap Cheap ..b) Nice and good qualityc) Did not Shrink for me atleast..Consa) Late shipment from Amazon - Can live with that becos of free shippingb) The buttons on this one are small and might not hold after some washes -- Already it started to hold loose after 3rd wash"
4,Good Shirt at a Great Price,"This shirt is as good as any that I have purchased at Macy's or Perisians. It is well cut, and the fabric has a quality feel."
2,Great product - hard to setup,I run WHS (Windows Home Server) and it requires several ports to be forwarded. This product works great when you have it set up. But it serverely lacks intuitive setup guide.
2,Incompatible w/ Vonage?,"Bought this 3Com router for SOHO-use with Verizon's FiOS Internet service. Among the devices on the LAN is a VOIP phone adapter that provides our Vonage phone service. Every morning at approximately the same time, the Vonage servers would send a packet stream that the 3Com router would misidentify as a SYN flood. The router's log showed the packet stream as a possible attack. Thereafter, the router would stop routing packets until it was restarted. Once restarted, it would function normally for approximately 24 hrs until the next packet stream arrived. This behavior was observed using the default settings on the router's firewall. I suspect a flaw in the router's firewall rules is responsible for the problem. Another (home brewed) router functions flawlessly in the same network environment."
4,Convenient for tripod work,"Shooting macro and long exposures with your Canon APS camera is much easier with this remote. But while it is more pleasant to use than the 2 second timer, it is an extra part to carry, so sometimes I forget or don't bother using it. Also, an infrared remote is more versatile since it lets you take shots of yourself as well.This switch is essential if you wish to shoot bulb."
5,Works great,"Works great with my Canon EOS Rebel 1000D. It's a pretty simple product, but it's a nice way to take a picture without jiggling the camera. I would have preferred an infrared remote, but the 1000D doesn't support that."
5,perfect for canon rebel xs,"I bought this for my Canon Rebel XS so I could do remotely shooting. This plugs right into the same area of the camera where you could plug the cord that uploads the pictures. I bought an extension to this as this cord alone is pretty short. So unless you plan on standing directly next to the camera to take the picture, I suggest buying a long cord to add to it as an extension."
4,"Light, solid and works just fine!","This thing is mainly useful for bulb exposures (you have to manually lock the shutter and unlock it when you have completed the exposure time, it doesnt count the time since it doesnt have any procesors or logical electronics inside). Another thing it may work great is to be taking pictures with the camera mounted on a tripod when you dont want to move it even by the shutter button being pushed.It works just great for those two things. The remote has a shape to make easy to roll the cable around it in the bottom has a little hole to ""connect"" the cable so that it can be stored without the cable going everywhere, its kinda clever. I would recommend this product if this is what you want it for and if you dont want to spend much."
5,Great Accessory,"A great accessory. I had the cordless remote and could never get it to work. The remote switch is just the ticket. Everyone says the cord is too short, it's not, it's just right and you don't have to get in front of the camera to make it work either. I wished I'd bought this a long time ago."
5,"Small, convenient remote for a Canon SLR's",This remote does exactly what I would expect. No issues whatsoever. If you need a simple wired remote then this would be a good choice. I have however purcahsed another 3rd party wired remote which allows me to do Time Lapse photography and other creative photography as well as just as a simple remote so I use the other one much more frequently. It is a bit bulkier though due to the features but also much cheaper than the original Canon.
3,Not for the 50D,"I bought this little gadget months ago and haven't had the chance to use it until now. Well, I guess I didn't USE it, as it does not fit my 50D. This bit of information would have been useful in the begining. Lesson learned."
3,Typical Canon - over priced accessory.,"This is not as bad as some accessories but still, $23.00 for plastic is bad.It does the job and works fine. Cord is too short for my liking - YMMV."
4,Pretty Good All Around Remote Switch,"What can I say that hasn't been said? It's a good remote switch for your Canon DSLR. The length of the cord is good. I rated it 4 stars because I seem to always need another 6 inches of cord. I primarily use this to take shots while the camera is mounted to a telescope. The button is fairly solid, for a completely plastic housing, and it slides forward to lock in place when you need a bulb shot. Buy one and take pictures of things that require you to not rock the mount."
5,Canon Remote Switch,"Cannot get any easier than this. Love it. Works especially well for those extra slow shutters, and now I get to be in some of the pics too!!!"
4,Great addition to my gear,"I have been using it for almost a month now and it's been a great help to me when taking night photos. I only wish it can do more.It's compatible with Canon EOS Rebel XTi,XSi,XS, and the latest Rebel T1i, also compatible with EOS Rebel G, EOS Elan II, EOS Elan IIe, and EOS IX. Great price. Thanks to Amazon and Adorama. If you'll ask if I will recommend this, Yes I will recommend this.You can see some of the photos I've taken at http://www.dailytechlog.com"
5,MUSTTTTTTTTTT HAVE!,"I mean it...you just have to have it! Before this, when using a tripod, I used to use the self-timer. And I hated the fact that on my digital rebel xt, I couldn't speed up the duration of the self-timer (10 sec) and hence would loose important time-dependent shots. This has made life SO much easier! Get it NOW! You won't regret it!"
4,Does not work with video.,"I was buying this as a button to help me to start/stop video recording. It doesn't work for that, it helps on the focusing (60d over here) when pressed halfway, but all the way down it takes a picture and it doesn't record. As no one posted something about video recording I suppose that I would give it a shot, but no It doesn't work for that if anyone was planning using it for that purpose."
5,Great Remote!,"Besides that the cable is somewhat short, this remote works extremely well. I also bought the Canon Wireless Remote Control RC1 which doesn't work well at all and only when it's held close to the camera and in a specific angle.....I do recommend this over the wireless one..."
3,Wrong name for shutter release cable,"This cord is not a remote control device as you might assume from its name. Rather, this is the same device that professionals would call a shutter release cable. It is meant to release the shutter button for long exposure shots to avoid shaking the camera when you touch it. You can also ""lock"" the shutter open for REALLY long shots (anything longer than 2 minutes). When you reach the desired exposure time, simply slide the button out of lock mode and the shutter will close.Unless you have four foot long arms and a fish-eye lens, you won't be able to use this cord to do self portraits. You will have to make do with the self timer. Unfortunately, according to my local rep, Canon does not make a more useful cordless remote that works with my Rebel 2000."
3,I should have paid closer attention to what I was buying,"I hate to rate this too low, because I'm sure that the product is great for it's intended use. However, I was looking for a remote control so that we could shoot a family photo in front of the Christmas tree. I assumed that this would be the item, but when I received it I realized that I would need a ten-foot long arm to accomplish my task as the cable is very short ... only about a foot long or so. My bad. I then purchased the Wireless remote RC1 for Digital Rebel, (also from Amazon), and love it. This one, however, is basically used for keeping the camera steady on a tripod so that you are not actually pressing a button on the camera. Great for that purpose ... just a heads up to anyone looking for a way to take pictures with you in it ... this is not your item (unless you want a picture of you nostrils close up). I'm keeping mine in case I ever need to do just that ... you never know."
2,Canon Remote Switch RS60-E3 For Rebel Series Digital SLRs,"The product works as advertised, but anytime I purchase something for X dollars and after receiving it, realize that it probably cost the Chinese manufacturer less than 10% of the retail cost to produce it, I'm disappointed. It shouldn't cost more that $3.98."
3,money for nothing chicks for free...so goes the song,"Well the first part of the title for this product is true $25 for this is a rip off.It is the size of a bic lighter and about a well made, for this it gets three stars max. I have not used it yet but even if it works $25 for this? I was forworned by other reviewers but I was to gun shy to make my own, their are many post on the www on how to do it your self and save some coin you can put towards one of their $1,500 len.So this is another one of those situations where canon rips you off.so it goes, you need a cable release if you use a tripod.PS chicks are never free.... ever"
4,Works great,"Just wish it had a longer cord. No complaints though, I read the description and got what I paid for."
2,worked well for a while,"I really enjoyed this remote at first and it did a great job. However after using the notch in the side to retain the cable, the cable fell appart. The notch tore the sheath of the wires and they are now exposed. I did not have it that long, about a year, before that happenned. It was not heavily used and spent most of its life in my camera bag.Not sure what I would recommend instead but given the price I needed it to last longer."
3,Wish the Cord was Longer.,So the whole purpose of this is so you dont shake the camera.. But yet the cord is like maybe 1' 1/2 Long? The slightest tug and you shake the camera.. would be great if the cord was just a couple more feet longer.
5,Does what it's supposed to do,Works as advertised at a great price. Essential for tripod photography
4,Great Accessory,"I bought this and a tripod for my Canon Digital Rebel. Both are must haves to experiment with depth of field and the ""wait for it"" shot. Very simple to use and hook up to camera. However, don't be confused. This is not the family portrait accessory. I would have given it 5 stars if the cord had been a little bit longer."
4,CANON REMOTE---EXCELLENT,I am very happy with the performance of this remote and would recommend it easily to other--the locking feature is nice.
3,Only works with SOME Canon EOS models,The Amazon product description says this switch works with Canon EOS cameras... but it only works with some EOS cameras. My Canon 5D Mark II takes an entirely different remote switch. You need to go to the Canon website and find out which remote switch your camera uses before ordering this switch.
3,Beware!! READ the smaller print for product compatibility when searching for assessories with specific compatibility.,I received this after what I thought was a lot of searching via Amazon for a product for a Canon 7d. Learned I was not reading the finer print well enough. Do not understand why this kept coming up if I was specific for products compatible with a Canon 7d. I am sure it works fine for a camera it is compatible with.
1,This wired remote does not fit a Canon 7D!!!!,"Although Amazon has this listed as fitting a Canon 7D, it does not. It has a plug end like a headset, where as the plug that fits the 7D needs to be the pin type. I usually read the reviews on a product but didn't in this case other wise, I wouldn't have purchased this remote and would have looked else where. Since I waited to try the remote, I missed the return window and so am stuck with it."
4,"Nice, but a little overpriced",This is a great switch I use on my Canon SLR. I use it primarily for night shots and anything else that requires a slow shutter speed. My only complaint is that I feel its a tad too expensive. An item like this should cost [less].
5,Stops Camera Shake,Very handy item when using a tripod. Helps keep me from shaking the camera as I press the shutter button.
5,Must Have!,"Works perfectly, Use it all the time. Every person should have one. Its a great tool to have in your bag. Probably used it over 1000 times already. A+"
5,Needed Accessory,"I use mine all the time for macro and longer exposure. Plug and go. Press half way down and it focuses, all the way down and it takes the shot. I have had mine for over 10 years and the housing finally came loose and wouldn't stay together. Wrapped a rubber band around the housing and it's still going strong."
5,Perfect to stop camera shake,"I bought this product for taking pictures of the stars, and moon. It helps elimate camera shake from using a 1000mm lens for the moon, and to make long exposures for the stars.Easy to use, can be locked for long exposures. The only downfall would be how short the cord is. Like someone else mentioned, a quick trip to an electrician can fix that.I uploaded a pick of the moon that I took for an example. Hopefully it will show up. The image quality will be reduced a lot from amazon shrinking it, but you will still get the basic idea."
4,Simple. Cheap. Easy to use.,"Performs exactly as advertised. Cable is a little short, but easy to extend with connectors from Radio Shack. Worth the meager investment."
3,What you would expect,"Was looking for a remote switch for my Canon T3. This is what you would expect, works fine. Price was good. Only complaint is that I wish the cord was just a little longer. However, reading the specifications prior to buying I knew it was going to be shorter."
4,Works,"Does what it's supposed to. I wish it was wireless, but that option is not available for my model camera, unfortunately."
3,Cord too short...,Great accessory of a great camera...but the cord is a bit short! I used the tripod to take a shot of me and my grandchild eating breakfast.
2,Canon Remote Switch RS60,"The mechanism is essentially a lockable electrical switch with a cord and mini-phonejack. I found it too easy to accidently slide the button in lock position causing several unintended exposures. Unless you make your own, it is the way you can remotely trigger the shutter mechanism."
5,A must have accessory for your DSLR,"Never thought a small and well priced unit will make me do more things with my DSLR. I borrowed one from my friend and tried it on my 400D Xti without a hint on how to use it. And I can say I enjoyed using it because it gave me more flexibility on my still and night shots. I can create natural over exposures even on very dim conditions. It just made digital photography more flexible and useful. So I knew I had to buy one for myself. Its already on its way.So if you want to have more flexibility on your still and night shots, you definitely need this simple and yet very useful gadget.This is one of those small and simple pieces of gadgets that just makes life easier ..."
4,"NOT FOR Canon EOS 7D, 5D Mark II, Mark III","This item works with the Entry level DSLR cameras like Canon Rebel T2i, XT, XTi, XSi, XS, T1i, EOS 550D/1000D/450D/400D/350D/300D but not all EOS cameras.The product is not for all EOS family of cameras - as mentioned in the description. This is misleading at first for a beginner.This will NOT work with Canon EOS 10D, 20D, 30D, 40D, 50D, 5D, 5D Mark II, 5D Mark III, 7D, 1D, 1Ds Mark II, III, IV cameras. These cameras have the same Shutter release slot Canon RS-80N3. Make sure to find the one right for your EOS camera.I hope this will help and save some of the return hassle for this item."
5,Its Been Over a Year,and absolutely no complaints :)I take plenty of scenic shots and time elpased photos so this has been an indispensable accessory.
5,GREAT SHOOTS!!!!,"I am soo glad that i bought this item, i can take long exposures images like Lightnings, Fireworks, Streets, Stars, etc.Really recomend it."
4,Sensitive,"I've found that the switch/trigger is quite sensitive and it likes to get in the ""lock"" position quite easily. Other than that, this is a quality Canon product!Pros: It's a remote shutter release.Cons: Short cord, gets tangled & twisted up easily."
4,Like the other reviews say...,"Great little gadget for keeping the camera super steady and tripping it remotely. Like the other reviews say, the cord is a little short, but other than that it works great!"
1,Not USB over Powerline,"This is not a USB over Powerline adapter. This is simply a device that provides a ""Powered"" usb port, that is used with a small number of electronics, usually those accessories on a pc, that require a powered usb port."
2,What a pain,It does a great job but installing the software and getting it to work are VERY difficult.There are much better solutions than this.Netgear and IOGear come to mind.
2,Did not do the trick,Thought I could use the product to run a printer on a network without the ethernet. No success but don't feel bad...I tried three others including an Apple Express - all chocked somewhere in the configuration or network niceness.
1,Can I Get My Money Back?,"This book is full of sloppy writing. On the first page there is the phrase ""an old woman's dark moustache ran the length of her upper lip."" Well, where else would the moustache be? I just picked this example because it was on the first page. There are lots of other instances of this on the other pages. Please, if the publisher is reading this or if the author is reading this, can I please get my money back?"
2,Not exactly what I expected.,"The Cleaning Kit is decent/nice but came with no instructions for the novice, and the UV filter and the 2 lithium batteries did not fit my Canon Rebel 2000."
3,Comes Incomplete,"The product in itself is quite complete for any beginner. Nevertheless I found that the idem should come with a manual or an instruction so that we could get started as soon as we get it. If you do not know how to use it, go to a bookstore and read a book before using the material."
5,A rollicking read!,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It was a real page-turner, and I especially enjoyed the uniqueness of her characters and their development. The author keeps us guessing about who the real bad guys are until the very end! As an additional bonus, Ms. Aviva provides us with several important cultural and historical tidbits about northern Spain and the Camino. It was literally a guidebook for the Camino, with mentions of food, wine, hotels, and interesting historical stops along the Camino. Not only am I interested in reading her book Following the Milky Way, but I am feeling more and more compelled to actually do the Camino pilgrimage. Well done!"
4,"A fun addition to the author's ""Following the Milky Way.""","This was a quick and fun read, with excellent historical info. I would have enjoyed a stronger character development in our heroine, Noa Webster. I learned quite a lot about the Camino and the food in Northern Spain by reading this book. Elyn has a smoothly flowing writing style which I enjoy. Be sure to read her ""Following the Milky Way."""
2,"The notes are there, but just barely","Although produced in Russia, Rachmaninoff's motherland, this recording of the symphonic dances leaves much to be desired. The orchestra sounds muffled overall, and the brass section sounds like it's from a 50's t.v. show. Buy another copy- it'd be worth the extra money."
3,Good deal,I got what I wanted. It was half the price of other places I had looked and I received it when I was told. I'm happy.
3,Not a Place to start on Olney,"The title aptly reflects my response to this CD. Having tasted Olney on the fullsome, 'Wheel' I wasn't prepared for the uneveness of the writing or performances herein. There are some upbeat gems, but too few, and all towards the latter third of the disc from,'That's All I need To Know' through to,'Dogwoods' The storytelling aspect on this album is somewhat dislocated from the musical settings, and prioritised. Apart from my irritation at his rattling off so many names and States from track to track, disorientating in itself, these appellations are employed as if their mere annunciation earns some special pleading for our attention. Crucially, Olney doesn't sound too convinced. There's decidedly more of a countrified feel to this than,'Wheel' but it comes over as a poor man's, John Prine minus the humour, or a John Stewart which is a sad report when Olney, clearly has better material in him."
3,A good workout but repetitive,"I love Petra Kolber. She is an excellent instructor and she gives really easy directions. HOWEVER I found this tape a bit repetitive after a few workouts and I really didn't like the music (hence the three stars). The tape does give a good workout. Petra seems to assume that the person soing the tape knows step lingo but after a few viewings you'll know what ""V"" step and ""over the top"" mean.This tape is a good value and worth the buy but I would recommend getting it along with another tape for variety."
1,Another Stinker,This is the second of the Versa Training series that I bought and it is not a good tape. Petra's mouth does not move in time with the words and that's just awful!
2,Too difficult to follow for average people,"I have had this video for years and every time I attempt to master it I once again put it up in frustration. I have several different step and non-step aerobic tapes and this by far is the most frustrating and difficult to follow. Granted I'm not a ""dancer,"" but I am athletic and the time and effort to learn the sequences in this tape are ridiculous. The arm and leg movements are not intuitive and by the time you think you have it, she's doing something else. Didn't intend to ""flame"" here, but I just saw too many positive reviews for this step-aerobic video."
4,FUN Workout,"This is such a fun workout. I recently bought a new tape to replace a worn out one. My only regret is that it does not have a DVD version (I'd give it 5 stars if it did). I'm a roller-coaster of fitness. When I'm out of shape this is just the ticket to get going again and stay motivated. When I am in really good shape this is my go to for fun when I need an easier day or I don't feel like working out. Instructor is great & encourages you to ""make it your own"". The workout is about 1/2 hour long. Go ahead - ENJOY working out."
4,"Fun, Short Workout","I really enjoy this workout on days when I am pressed for time or feeling very tired. The entire workout is about 30 minutes long--5 min warm-up, 20 minute step workout, and 5 minute cool down and stretch. I am not at all coordinated, so if I can catch onto the steps anyone can! Petra Kolber starts with basic step moves and then adds some spice and some intensity. I also like the fact that she encourages you to do what feels comfortable to you. The music is so-so but not at all intrusive or annoying. The only thing that I really don't like about the video is that many of the arm movements feel unnatural with the leg movements. They just seem like they don't go together well and are awkward to do. Otherwise, I really enjoy this video."
3,Use with Zip Ties (Cable Ties) and You Won't Lose your Rails,"These work great as long as anchored in place with zip-ties (cable ties) or wire. Used alone and as intended by the manufacturer, the plastic snap-in ends are not strong enough to keep the rails in place, even for a single season. I don't know if the birds inadvertently carry the rails off, or if the snap-in part is just too weak, but they end up either missing or on the ground.I purchased UV-rated zip ties (so they don't disintegrate in sunlight). I use two zip-ties per railing. Insert one end up through a porch hole, around the rail and back down through an adjacent hole. Zip and snug them up, snip off the loose end and you are good-to-go - you don't lose your railing. I have done the same thing with wire but it takes a little bit longer to attach and isn't as clean-looking as the zip ties."
3,Works with Modifications,"I purchased this for my Leviton 420 structured wiring box. It's a Leviton product made to fit in a Leviton Structured Media enclosure. It would seem that this module would bolt into the enclosure with no problems. Well it does not bolt in! Maybe there was a design change that made the products not work together?Anyhow, I had to cut out some extra steel from the enclosure to make it fit. Once installed, the power module works fine, and the surge suppressor outlets are nice.I'm knocking off two stars off the rating for my trouble."
4,Works Great in Leviton Enclosure,Works great in Leviton Enclosure. Nice to have four outlets. Try to get it on-sale since it can be expensive. Not much more to say beyond it works well.
4,Good product for providing power to your SMC,"Last weekend my friend and I installed this power module and a 420 SMC enclosure in my wall. While at first glance this module seems overpriced, even at Amazon's current $50, the included receptacles alone (hospital grade surge protectors) sell for around $30 each; throw in some sheet metal and now how much would you pay? There's also a similar power module available with plain (non surge-protected) outlets at a lower cost.Seriously, there's not much to say about this. It fits into a cutout at the bottom of the SMC. Don't forget to allow for the extra height that this module requires. I like the fact that the power module doesn't take space inside the SMC enclosure (but we did have to chisel out some space in the wall cross brace underneath it to make it fit)."
3,Don't let the Sale Price Fool You,"Sure, it sounds like a GREAT value with a sale price of less than $6.00 for this 4-pack, but don't be fool. TRU isn't really charging this low. What you may not notice until it's too late, is that the shipping is calculated so that this item has to be shipped by itself and not included with anything else bought, making you pay MORE for the shipping of the item than the cost of the item itself! Think if you buy multiple of this item that you will save on shipping? NO, you WON'T! I suspect TRU does this on several other items as well. The snuck the extra shipping charges on me, and even shipped the item WITH the other items I purchased."
1,Worst Bubble Wrap Ever!,"I have purchased quite a bit of bubble wrap on Amazon, and I must say this is the worst I have ever tried! Not only did it ship in a flimsy plastic bag, which had several holes in, but the bubble wrap itself is very flimsy. The perforations are extremely hard to find, the the overall quality is just really cheep. I would not by this again!"
3,Almost good,"First things first... the product met my expectations. No issue with thatSecond.... the product arrived in a reasonable time... no issue with that.So the only reason for not giving this supplier a 5 Star rating was that the bundle I received was short of the advertised 175 feet, by about 20 feet.Because I did not unroll the entire package and measure it first, I only noticed the missing material when I was about 3/4 done.It was at that time that I realized that I was likely to be short on material. Fortunately, by adjusting my usage, I was able to complete the project with less than I originally planned.I hope this was an isolated error and that the company tries to avoid this by insuring any errors are on the safe-side and thus transparent to the customer."
2,Fair quality,After buying this product I purchased a box of bubble wrap at Sam's Club. The cost as about the same but the quality of the bubble wrap I bought at Sams was much better!
3,It served its purpose,"I imagined this product to be wider and thicker. The product is quite flimsy. In all, it served its purpose. I dont know if I would buy this product again."
5,Am pleased with the product received...,"This is bubble wrap, so not a lot to say, other than it was received on-time and as described. The perferations are well-made...tough enough to hold without tearing when I don't want it to, yet easily enough separated when I DO want to."
5,good as advertised,"There is nothing fancy about the bubble wrap, it's not feature rich, it does not provide added value, it just plainly works as a bubble wrap should do. That's all I want."
5,MY ITEMS ALL WRAPPED UP,"I HAD BEEN BUYING MY SHIPPING SUPPLIES FROM THE DOLLAR STORE AND WALMART, MANY TIMES STORES WERE OUT OF WHAT I NEEDED.I FOUND THIS BUBBLE WRAP AT AMAZON.COM AT A GOOD PRICE. NOW ALL MY ITEMS ARE WRAPPED UP, ALMOST USED 1/2 ALREADY.CHECK AMAZON.COM BEFORE GOING TO THE STORE FOR ANYTHING....THANKS GLENDA-------GOT HERE BEFORE SHIPPING TIME WAS UP------"
4,Decent to Good,"Athough it is not as good as their previous albums, it is like 3 steps above the songs from B2K. This album is more on the hardcore rap side than the R&B side. This cd has a decent set of tracks and vocals are good. Well, it is better this cd be explicit than ""boy band"" corny. This is suggested to from of hip-hop/R&B rap & long time fans. I also like that they don't overuse their sexiness like some other r&b groups."
3,GRADE = C minus,"As I make this review, I see that there is only 1 (one) left in stock. (SMH) I am a true to the game New Edition fan & I like BBD also but this cd is not one of their better one's. I listened to the playlist and it's just not hott. Now, I thought this album by Bell Biv Devoe was good, but not as good as their previous works. Most of the songs continue the wild themes displayed on Poison, but this album can't really compete against the music competition that is out there today. In my opinion, for longtime fans, BBD still gives you what you want, so get it! For the newbies not into BBD's early 90's sound, you should pass on this cd and get something else. YMMV...NEOSOUL06"
3,"Good effort despite the explicit, steamy themes","I thought this album by Bell Biv Devoe was good, but not as good as Poison or Hootie Mack. Most of the songs continue the wild themes displayed on Poison, but there are some very funky, danceable, bass heavy songs to match with the steamy lyrics. It's closer to what Prince was doing on his first few Warner Bros. albums with the sexy themes. Pesos is the best of this album's kinds of songs. But they also slow it down with a few ballads written and produced by members of R&B group Jagged Edge. This album didn't do well against the heavy music competition. And one problem--everybody had toned down in their music content while the trio was still laying it thick on their over the top MENTAL(!) sounds. For longtime fans, BBD still gives you what you want, so get it! For the newbies not into BBD's sound, you should pass on this effort and get something else."
4,True Fan!!!!,"I'm listening to it right now. Hey, what can I say, I really like this CD. But if I wasn't a true fan of New Edition/BBD then I probably would have never bought it. If you buy music for the funky beats....""Sic wit it""....the smooth saltery sounds....""In my crib""....or a R&B ballet...""I Ain't Going Nowhere"", then this is the CD for you. ... Great way to come back fellas! But unfortunately if you don't have a Neptune beat attached you get no air play. (no offense neptunes your beats are tight). Yeah but if they were new artist every radio station would be blastin their songs. So what if Ricky Bell doesn't have a strong voice or Michael Bivins & Ronnie DeVoe aren't the best rappers, but who said B2K could sing and P-Diddy could rap. Yeah but don't sleep this CD has other joints on it like ""Breezy""...""Home Alone"".....just buy it and decide for yourself!!!!"
3,BBD - Hootie Whack?,"When you talk about pioneers of todays current Hip Hop format, you've got to include Bell Biv Devoe in that discussion. One could argue that BBD helped start the whole ""sing a verse, rap a versue"" genre that is extremely popular. If you rocked ""Poison"" and ""Do Me"" back in the day, then you know what I mean. So why does their 4th effort just seem outdated? Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of banging dance tracks, but what ever happend to the singing part of the equation? Ricky Bel is the lead singer here, but he often sounds disjointed. BBD used to always have the hot slow jams (""When Will I See You Smile"", ""Something In Your Eyes"" & ""I Do""), but this effort only gives us one groove track (""I Ain't Going No Where""). What gives? Instead of sounding hot, BBD sounds like a group that has reached a midlife crisis, they have no identity. Who ever told Ronnie Devoe and Michael Bivins that they could rap anyway? This makes me long for the days of old....bring back New Edition!"
2,No need to go so raunch to regain cred,"I know that this is their background and not the kid group we think that they all came from, but trying to regain the charts with this did not achieve or attempt to put them in the bad boy league."
5,Well Above Expectations,"With only seconds long effortless insertion, these nearly invisible plugs allowed perfect play while they created a smooth, sealed, closed hole feel to the instrument."
4,Great fit for my Flute!,"My flute is a Gemeinhardt open hole, and these plugs fit perfectly. Great buy! I looked to buy plugs at my local music store and they were hard plastic ""table like"" plugs. Not only were they not compfy on my fingers they were also twice the price! Glad I checked Amazon!"
4,Eh not great but pretty good.,"Eh actually this is my first real exposure to kitty, and I borrowed the cd at that. The Remix was great, the original was not as good but still interesting the live tracks were ok. But used, or download, or just borrow. It's actually more of a 3.5 stars but i'll give it 4 cuz the safe remix i really like. even if u dont want to but the album, download that track. Althought this album wasn't spectacular, it's worth looking at there other work for me now."
3,"Safe is great, the rest lacks something","The industrial remix is awsome, I loved it...the radio edit, well it's the same as the album, almost, but not as good and so it loses points...Safe was my favorite track of Oricle so I had to get this...now heres the problem...as I said in my title...the rest of the CD, the live songs, lack something and that somthing is Talena, Kittie's first bass player. Jennifer is NO Talena and that is sad because Talena could sing and she could play bass and this new girl can do neither...KITTIE, heres a word of advise...BEG TALENA AND FALON TO COME BACK! YOU NEED THEM..."
1,"Morgan, what were you thinking?","Whatever or whoever KMFDM Inc. is, they took a great song and ruined it with overmodulated sound effects and an ill-fitting backbeat.Morgan Lander has always taken a lot of flak for her inderscernible roaring. True fans know that Kittie's frontwoman has genuine vocal talent. She doesn't need to scream to convey power & pain. Songs like SAFE are proof positive of this. One of Morgan's best vocals ever is lost in this confusing and clubby version.Everything else on the CD is great. There are some impressive live tracks and the video footage is definately cool. Also included is the original version of SAFE, which now sounds even better after listening to this dreadful remix."
3,glad i wasnt there,"safe...kmfkdmf(or whatever the hell that bands name is)remix is awesome, even though all these people say it sucks. its better than the original cuz its got an actual beat and its kinda industralized with morgans voice which still sounds the same-then theres the original safe a little bit shorter, and boring as always, when i listen to this i miss the remix-as for the live tracks...thats what brought this cd down, the screaming made me laugh like it did on spit...and as for the singing, oh my god, that was worse...she sounded like she was trying to give birth to a dolphin out her nose-live footage...pretty ok but the live tracks werent that great so why should this be?-so basically, only for severe kittie fans that dont mind crappy music, with a really really great remix(despite what evveryone says), the remix is the only reason why i bought this in the first place any way...DONT LISTEN TO THEM ALL THE REMIX OF SAFE ROX A LOT"
1,Don't buy Oracle or Safe,"Both Oracle and Safe are horrendous. ""Spit"", their debut album with Talena Atfield and Fallon Bowman best captured the raw energy of the band. The Paperdool EP is also good. Anything after that is junk without melody, just noises and screams. I don't recomend this CD, it really stinks. Sorry guys, you lost your fan base and your way once Talena and Fallon left the band. Kittie as a viable group is dead."
3,"I love Kittie, but....","This is probaly their worst work so far.- The ""Safe"" remix is very cool and i enjoy it. It's like industrial metal. They mixed it very well. I like it- The ""Safe"" radio edit isn't any different from the album version, just this has a shorter ending. Still a very good track- The live tracks. Well, let me start off by saying that Morgan's singing is what brought this CD down. Morgan's singing is HORRIBLE. It's very whiny and just plain awful. Her singing is really pretty on ""Paperdoll EP""(and on all of the other CD's her singing sounds beautiful, but again she's in the studio)..i don't know what happend :(. I mean, i can sing better than Morgan on this CD. Other than the horrible singing, they sound quite good.Overall, this is pretty good but could have been WAY better if the singing was better. (...)"
2,Not That Good...,"I dont even like Kittie that much, just some of their stuff, but Safe is a good song. The only reason I bought it was because KMFDM remixed it. Save your money and buy a KMFDM cd instead. You'll like it better. Just d/l the one good song off of this album."
4,"""A good album to add to your Kittie collection""","I think the best part of this album is that it has live performances, although is not a first for a Kittie album, is better than ""paperdoll"" just due to the fact that ""oracle"" has better songs than ""Spit"". This is a must for any Kittie fan and our collection just wouldn't be complete without it. The only downside to this album is the ""Safe Remix"" isn't really something that fits Kittie's style. but overall it's a good album and any Kittie fan would enjoy it."
2,Oversimplification of TRIZ,"I selected this book because the TOC indicated that two pages were deveoted to each of the 40 priciples. This is because 2-3 diagrams take up one page and the second page is blank. The diagrams were not very effective at conveying the underlying priciple and most diagrams were a mediocre example of the application of the principle.There is little information in this text on how to identify and develop the inherent contradiction that one is trying to solve. However, the contradiction matrix at the end is relatively easy to read when determining which priciples to apply to a problem.I had hoped to buy a single book on TRIZ to get a better understanding of the theory and its application. This book was not sufficient for that purpose."
3,Have fun from TRIZ,"The famous Altshuller's inventive principles (1969) with funny illustrations. Semyon Savransky, The TRIZ Experts"
5,Amazing worship at an upbeat pace,This album is phenomenal! I've used it over and over to help me find peace in the midst of stormy waters. I've listed the lyrics to You Alone on my blog (http://supernaturalcraving.blogspot.com) and have had dozens of hits looking for this incredible song!
5,cable,recibimos el producto rapido y en buenas condiciones sin ningun tipo de problemas el envio tambien a pesar de lo lejos fue bastante rapido
1,Not the item pictured,"This display is very mis-leading. Looking at the picture, it's an audio/video cable. That's what I wanted. AFTER I paid for it, I saw the wording saying it was a video cable (only). I was pissed. The picture depicts an audio/video cable!!!"
5,Thought Provoking,"This is the book to read if you really want to THINK about your life and how involved you are with love, marriage, respect and relationships in both general and specific terms. This book makes you realize how important it is to be able to love yourself so that you may love others and fully understand how your behavior and feelings can influence all of the loved ones in your life. This is a very touching, well thought out book that everyone should read. It is easy to follow with very complex messages."
4,A Pleasant and Upbeat Read,"Surrounded by people concerned primarily with money and self-aggrandizement, Mr. Oak reminds us to slow down, take a step back, and think about those we love. His vignettes provide insight into the meaning of love in its varied expressions. They serve as a good basis for examining our feelings for one another."
3,This music style is not for Yo-Yo-Ma,"Yo-Yo-Ma is absolutely great in highly emotional music as in his ""Soul Of Tango"" CD. But he's a just plain OK musician for intellectual classic music. He's probably taking classic music too seriously."
4,"Very good, but not his best!","Yo-Yo Ma does it again with his style and grace! However it's not his best! My favorite remains Classic Yo-Yo. It has tango samplings, Bach cello suite, Gershwins's famous first prelude has a new sound with a swinging cellow and piano accompaniment, and then there is my all time favorite by Alison Kraus singing ""Simple Gifts"". She has a beautiful voice which has led me to purchase more of her work. Well I have just given you a review for Classic Yo-Yo! This one just was boring to me and I like eclectic, I guess!"
4,I don't get it,"My mother-in-law got me this CD about 2 Christmases ago. I'm sorry; I gave it another try today, and it still sounds like a lot of musical gibberish to me. I don't pretend to be a music critic, but my appreciation of music does range rather widely, from Classical to Country. However, this one just escapes me. I'll rate it a 4. I would rate it lower, but I'm open to the possibility that I'm just too dense to understand it. If this is the case, then I'm inviting anyone who follows my comment with theirs to set me straight."
1,A Waste of Money,"If you have not had a pre-calculus class and are looking to learn pre-calc, do not look here. The book is riddled with mistakes that were very confusing. Not to mention, the explanations are often vague and uncheritably written. Al in all, a terrible book. Check out Pre-calculus demystified instead."
2,WARNING,"I give this book a poor rating because I found many mistakes in the problems at the end of chapters. Personally, I still got alot of use out of the book because I basically knew the material and just needed to brush up. However, if you truly need a study aid to help you learn the material, I don't recommend this book. The errors will just serve to confuse you.."
5,Digital is Right!,"I think that most kids these days spend most of their time on the net and not reading, but combineing the fun of the net and the knologe of reading into one is genus! It is the collideing of two things to make a better proudct!"
5,Digital Detectives #1: The Case of the Killer Bugs,This book is really awesome! The web scenes are so fun. I can't wait to get Digital Detectives #2.
5,"An ""Out of Book"" Experience","Both my 8 year old son and my 11 year old daughter found ""The Case of the Killer Bugs"" to be ""neat and fun"". This new concept of reading and solving the mystery on-line kept my children enthralled for hours. I look forward to purchasing the next book, ""When Nightmares Come True"". These books will be great stocking stuffers for all my nieces and nephews because the cost is so low. I hope the Digital Detective Mysteries become a series so I can collect all of them for my children. Montavon keep them coming!"
3,Web site has forgotten about this book,It is a shame; I went to the link given in the book and couldn't find the book or the claimed log in. Other than that the book has a pretty good plotabout kids solving a computer crime of pirating and a virus.It was so right on about how petty people can be in the high tech world.Sort of Animal Farm with the pigs being over age delinquents.Computers really weren't originally made for games or making music either.These kids are in the era before the first Internet bust...
5,"Easy install, better performance",The extra memory boost is well worth the modest cost. I often have two or three applications open at once and doubling my iMac's memory has speeded things up noticeably if not dramatically. Anyone with a phillips screwdriver can do the replacement. Plenty of short videos on YouTube if you need a little guidance.
5,Pleasantly Surprised!,"From what I have skimmed through so far, I love this book. As a Sufi practitioner of the Craft, on the more Light, Herbal, Healing side, I wanted a book that could speak of the Dark side, but not be like a evil or dark-worshiping manual. This book seems great so far. Coughlin is well versed in Magickal Arts and does a great job giving rightful respect to the Dark elements of each and every one of us, for all of us, indeed have, both Light and Dark in us. There is a lot about protection from malicious attack and also rightful mentioning of Ethics and how the Threefold Law will haunt those that disobey the laws of Nature - that is by causing harm on others or the natural world. I do like this book so far and am eager to finish it!"
4,A good overview,"I found this book well balanced between the light and dark side of paganism. I found it quite insightful in many areas, some of which I had already an interest in."
2,Where's the Dark Magick,"I might have been expecting too much, but I was disappointed with this book. I did not learn anything on Dark Magick per se. The first half of the book is about a variety of subjects like, Goths, Vampires, Lost Souls, the Collective Unconscious, Dark Deities, Satanism and some other stuff. The second half is about Magick, but it sounds more like High Magick to me. Where's the Dark Magick?"
5,Thorough and inspiring,Brabazon thoroughly researched Dr. Schweitzer through reading his personal and professional writings as well as talking to a remarkable number of people who knew him. The result is a book that goes far in providing an understanding of a remarkable personality and a marvelous soul.
2,Durable but not Sturdy,"This toy is durable in a sense that it will last outdoors, etc. However, there is no safety feature to keep toddlers from falling off as they try to maneuver the handles.. Also, both of my children had there fingers caught in the mechanisms on two separate occasions. good luck ."
4,Broke after 3 days at beach,"The digger met all expectations, until it broke. It gave our son the hands on feel of what the big earth movers do. He loved it, but it only lasted three days! He is 45 pounds and 4 years old. The scoop bent away from the arm and broke. He wasn't in clay, just sand. The scoop needs reinforcement--our neighbors child has the same problem."
2,Sorry bucket,"The bucket is made of folded sheetmetal with 2 tack welds to keep the folds in place. Well, the tack welds broke easily, so the sheetmetal started to unfold until you get a piece of sharp metal flapping at the end of the arm mechanism. Good luck trying to find a manufacturer phone number (you get Breyer horses instead), customer service number, replacement part number, ...anything??"
3,Broke in One Day!,"We gave this to our son for his 3rd birthday and the scoop broke the next day. Too bad, because he LOVED it. Great concept, poor construction."
3,Nice,"Overall, this product is very nice. I did not really appreciate that fact that there werent any pockets on it however."
3,Sin espacio para accesorios,"Debo admitir que el estuche para la cámara es muy bonito y se puede llevar cómodamente. Sin embargo, se olvidaron de que una cámara digital usa pilas y además las fotos se guardan en una memoria. No tiene ningún bolsillo para llevar ninguna de estas cosas, así que si salgo con mi cámara, igualmente debo buscar en donde cargar los accesorios. La verdad necesitaba algo más práctico."
1,not practical,"This case looks nice but that's about it. It is not practical. You can find much better cases that can hold your camera, disks, batteries and even a cell phone for less money. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
4,The best case for your Canon S20!,... I was very happy with the quality and fit for my [price]. This case even features a Power Shot logo on the close flap (very smart looking). It also lets the wrist strap extend and has a strong belt loop for carrying. The best case for your expensive camera! Fast access and safe protection.
2,"Flashy, but not functional","Case is O.K. Looks nice, soft leather--very little padding/protection offered. If you go for looks, pick it up. My rating is on practicality--I want my investment protected, not dressed up."
2,I wouldn't really call it deluxe.,"I waited for several weeks to get his which may account for some of my emotional letdown. Though the camera fits in nicely, the case wouldn't do much to protect the camera and you pull it out to use it, so in use its not much help at all. I am still looking for something I can really use. I do agree that Cannon could have included it with the camera considering how much you have to fork out for it."
4,Protects your Canon A20,This camera case is made of genuine leather and fits my Canon A20 perfectly. It is a worthwhile investment...for protecting your camera...
4,Pretty nice case,"When you put a battery and two CF cases in the included slots, the case is the perfect size for the S10/S20. I think a zippered closure would be better to keep there from being any gaps when the case is closed, but otherwise I am happy. Now I need to find a way to carry the manuals, cables, software, and charger along on trips!"
2,Messed up Hood Ornament,"I know that it is a manufacturer defect, but the seller should have paid closer attention before shipping a defective product. It was a gift, and I was embarrassed in front of my entire family and friends when the shoddy replica was removed from the box. Will look elsewhere in the future when buying diecast cars."
4,Very good.,"This is a very good art book. David Ho is an awesome artist. His works are dark, captivating and simbolic. The book is relativly long with lots of art in it and printed on the best quality paper i've seen in an art book to date.Fans of 2d and 3d digital art, photomanipulation, and dark-themed art will want to pick this one up.If you like this you may also want to get Black Rust by Chad Michael Ward"
1,Looks Nice BUT....,"looks nice but didn't fit, amazon said it would fit my 2003 honda accord EX-L, when i unscrewed the factory ones and tried to screw these on i couldn't the hole on this one is too big so the piston just falls right now and it doesn't tighten because the thread ain't catching anything because its too big, wish they would know better than to say its fits if it in fact wouldn't, waste of money"
2,A testament to the fact that the movie is sometimes better.,"Wow! What an awful book. It's fun though in an idiotic way. Also, it's a great education in screenwriting; seriously, you should check out the movie ""Three Days of the Condor."""
3,6 of 3,"Of Course, James Grady's book is the basis for the excellent film, which I watch every time it is shown on TV, mainly to see and hear the performances of Cliff Robertson and Max von Sydow which are sadly missing in the book.If anything, the screenplay by Lorenzo Semple Jr. and David Rayfiel make the story more believable. After being kidnapped at gunpoint, Kathy Hale, unlike Wendy Ross, was none to eager to hop in the sack with her uninvited guest.The book is a good fast read and the book's Mcguffin was as valid as the film's.Would have rated the book higher but for the incredulously over-eager bedroom escapades."
4,Six Days of the Condor,"I like the movie ""Three Days of the Condor"", and always wondered what happened to those other 3 days. Now I know. A little slow but still worth the read."
3,He had an inspiration in the middle of a sneeze?,"That's one of Grady's lines in the book. This is one case where the movie dwarfs the book. Malcom, the main character in the novel, is crude and hardly thinks or speaks like a well-read man. Grady's prose is minimal and often almost comical, as are the coincidences. A man grabs a woman at gunpoint, then gives her the gun and takes a thirty minute shower and she's cooking dinner when he gets out? Please. Grady also writes in omniscient point-of-view, so we jump into heads like ping pong balls. The three stars are for the premise, which is enticing and fun, and for its time, fresh. But if you want action that flows from circumstance and a main character who is ill-equipped to compete in the world of the CIA and must rely on some gambits and brains, forget the book and read the screenplay."
4,Great Book,I first read this book in High School and got caught up in it. I have read it a second time and still think its great. I didn't care for the movie all that much. The book is written very graphically and it kept me interested the whole way. I read it as an assignment for a book report the first time and loved it. The second time was just for fun. There are only a few books that I have read cover to cover that I thought were worth it. This was one of them.
2,The movie was much better,"I've seen the movie with Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway several times, so I thought I'd read the book. Given that the novel was written in the 1970s by a 20-something first-time novelist, it was okay.For the author it must have been quite exciting. His first book made into a major movie with top stars.I'm sure James Grady has learned enough since then not to rely so heavily on coincidence as a plot device.Also it is very annoying to jump from POV to POV on the same page.The one thing in the book that was better than the movie was the explanation for the initial ""hit."" I found the book's explanation far more plausible than the movie's.The book was worth reading, but only barely."
3,These Days Have Dated,"The ingenious premise still works in this swift thriller, and there are some interesting real-world details. Unfortunately, there are some clumsy notes, pretty wild coincidences and lots of nondescript characters filling out the action."
4,"Great gift to share with parents, babysitters friends",As an EMT I give this to anyone I know having a baby. It is a great shower gift or baby gift. It gets right down to what you need to know. It is easy to understand. Everyone should know the basics in this video so they may save their own child or another if they are in that situation. A great DVD to make sure anyone caring for the baby watches.
2,Only 17 minutes DVD,"Although it's listed in the product detail, you might not notice that this DVD is only 17 minutes long, including introduction. The actual content is only about 10 minutes long. You might as well find similar tutorial online, for free!"
5,Easy and Concise Explanation,"Being a new mother, this video has helped to put me at ease and know what steps I need to take in the event of an emergency with my baby. It is not only full of information, but it is extremely easy to follow and understand. I would recommend this video to new parents as well as people who are in the presence of young children. This video is a must! I'm putting it on the gift list for all of my expecting friends!"
4,Photoshop CS Trickery & FX (Graphics Series) by Stephen Burns,"A well designed book, not for the beginner but straight forward enough to clearly understand the process. The design of the book stimulates and enhances the creative juices with enough information to help you to move on to newer and bigger things. I would certainly recommend this book."
2,Very advanced,"I know photoshop fairly well (intermediate) and I find this book very advanced. The instructions are also difficult to follow, and what I got onscreen didn't follow what they got. You have to already have some understanding of masks and channels to begin with to grasp the concepts, and even then I found it hard. I would only buy this book if you want to learn advanced techniques that the average person will never use or remember."
3,moderate,"To listen to the new LOE release, is to listen to a constant evolution. Styles are changing and keep changing in intensity, while still staying in the dinstinctive styles that fans have come to know LOE by. The change of labels to Metropolis is a positive move towards greater social recognition of this act, but while public awareness of the act gets greater, the actual pieces contained within, suffer. This release isnt overtly listenable as some past releases, but it aint crap either. I thouroughly enjoyed ""In love with the night""."
2,For Beatlemaniacs only!,"If you buy this CD you must really love the Beatles. Its exciting if your a die hard fan otherwise its an hour of noise. The interviews are interesting, yet they drag on forever. This CD is essential if you like being bored to death."
5,To surpass oneself is among life's greatest rewards,"Wayne Gretzky's retirement from hockey seems a fitting occasion to remark on the phenomenal collection of virtuosos Ken Carbone has gathered together in his new book. The gift of a Virtuoso like Gretzky, and of this book, is the realization that absolute focus and dedication to a passion can lead one beyond oneself. That message resounds like a gong through the handsomely designed pages and expressive photographs of The Virtuoso. The thrill of sharing a Virtuoso's talent is the transcendence it offers, the visceral feeling that one is witnessing, in the Eastern sense, life lived fully in the moment. Inspiration, indeed."
4,A Great Find,"This book is beautiful but dated. Pages are gritty and printing seems a little over-saturated as compared to other Howard Schatz books. That said, it is still a great book with fascinating subjects."
5,Great reference book,"Rules for Bus. Writers is an excellent quick reference to keep handy at your desk. Plenty of material for beginners as well as advanced writers. I liked the quick tips and good resources. I'd rate it ""concise and helpful plus very easy to use"" - it's a short and to the point guide. You don't have to wade through long passages of chitchat and padding to get the help you need. Highly recommend it!"
1,Does not work as advertised,"I have a Canon Powershot S200 and this cable was supposed to work with it. However, connecting it to my Mac Book Pro and the camera was not recognized. Not sure if it's the cable or not but I believe it worked before with the original cable (which I have lost)."
3,Anti-Wahhabi,"Encyclopedia of Islamic Doctrine; by Shaykh Muhammad Hisham Kabbani; As-Summan Foundation of America; 8 different paperbacks; 1998.Vol. 1: Beliefs [Islamic](Aqida): Topics: the Ashari school, Salafis movement, how Salafis malign Asharis, Hanbali school, khawarij, Ibn Taymiyya, anthropomorphism, the aberrations of the Wahhabis and Salafis.Vol. 2: Remembrance of Allah and praising the Prophet (Dhikr Allah, Madih, Naat, Qasidat al-Burda)Vol. 3: The Prophet: Commemorations, Visitation and His knowledge of the Unseen (Mawlid, ziyara, Ilm al-Ghayb)Vol. 4: Intercession (Shafaa, tawassul, istighatha)Vol. 5: Self-purification: State of Excellence (Tazkiyat al-Nafs/Tasawwuf, ihsan)Vol. 6: Forgotten aspects of Islamic worship: Part One.Vol. 7: Forgotten aspects of Islamic worship: Part Two.Vol. 8: Indices."
1,"Bad Compilation, low volume","I agree with the others, bad composition.The volume level on this is much lower than my othermp3's. I have to raise it when one of these songs comes on the shuffle."
4,Always John!,16 of his many hits. Good recording and enjoying listing to this selection of John Denver's songs. A good buy.
3,Lot's of old favorites,"I purchased this allbum primarily for Annie's Song, which is very good for Viennese Waltz. Although it was the only one of it's kind on the album, there were enough ""keepers"" to make it worth the price."
5,You really can't beat John Denver,I used to listen to John Denver every night growing up. His lyrics are so simple yet profound. This album definitely hits the best ones!
1,There are better compilations out there!,"I am a 40 something ""kid reviewer"" who IS old enough to remember John Denver's music. Like I said before this ""16 Biggest"" hits only has 1 picture of John and has the studio version of ""Thank God I'm A Country Boy"" where they mislead people by listing: LIVE VERSION!. In the inside cover it pictures other ""16 Biggest"" artists...this is an insult to the great John Denver. Hey Elna why don't you check out ""The Essential John Denver""(The 2007 RCA/Legacy version not Madacy)...you will find out that IS the PERFECT 2CD SET not this single disc ""16 Biggest Hits""! THIS ""BIG KID"" DOES KNOW WHAT A GOOD JOHN DENVER COLLECTION CONSISTS OF...THANK YOU!"
1,NOT a perfect collection,"Elna's got it all wrong...If you want the best John Denver collection buy the new ""Essential John Denver"" from RCA/Legacy that just came out this past February. This ""16 Biggest Hits"" DOES NOT do justice whatsoever where the ""Essential"" collection has many pictures and good liner notes about John plus it has a hell of lot more songs than this stupid hits package.5 STARS for John Denver & 0 STARS for this travesty!!!"
2,You've got to like the live scene or else save your money!,I didn't like the live presentation. It was not what I was looking fo
4,Campy tale of horror and humor,"Writer Barry Ratcliffe's imaginative, campy script mixes horror with humor. Low budget but high talent version of the sotry of Pocahauntus' revenge. A showcase for up and coming stars!"
3,Could be sharper,"I got this and its fie grater cousin to replace two aging and now dull Microplane Professional graters. They are not nearly as sharp as they should be. When zesting citrus, they tear into the skin, snagging a lot of pith. I am sure they are fine for mincing garlic and ginger, but the Microplanes did it all. I must admit, however, I like how this one grates hard cheese."
3,Too simple for real insight,"This book was the text for my college speech course, along with another text. I personally found it too simple to gain any significant knowledge. It states the obvious and gives oversimplified examples. It would serve well as a high school course, but not college."
2,good for dogs that want to chew,The product just does not work for my two dogs. They lick instead of chew. And the dogs are very small so even the small size is too big for their small mouths. IF it was not so wide around in the middle or had different diameters maybe it would work better for very small dogs.
4,dog tooth scrubber,"I received the order in a timely manner. It is one of the best products for very small dogs to help clean teeth. Our dog, however, is a Westie. It was perfect when they were tiny but now they can chew it apart in a couple of hours. If I could find a larger size I would purchase this again."
3,Not a very fun toy...,"Basically this figure is a revamp of the Ep. 1 figure. The only differences being the pit droid hat and the different wings and a stand for him to be on. But other than that, this figure is only good for completist collectors (like myself) or kids who just want a watto figure if they missed the original."
4,"You're Getting Old, Man.","Watto isn't too bad of an action figure. The detail is rather extraordinary, especially in the figures face. However, the detail also makes his skin color somewhat out of sinc: the colors of his skin are right but they are extremely bright and do not appear to be very realistic. Also, the wings are kind of flimsy. Other than that, Watto is a fun addition to add to any Star Wars action figure collection. I especially like getting my Anakin figure out and having him talk down to and beat up Watto."
2,serviceable but mediocre,"This case will serve to protect your palm against scratches and dings, but completely lacks convenience features such as a belt clip and a clasp to hold it closed (not even velcro -- nothing at all). The seams are all single-stitched, though the leather seems thick enough to provide adequate protection. With a Handera 330 handheld, the leather covers up the jog dial and back button, and the HotSync serial port, so you must remove the PDA to use these features. It also covers up the Handera power-on button.In sum, adequate but lacking any creature comforts whatsoever."

3,Oh well,"If your a Johnny Fan you'll dig it. If your a casual fan or starting to discover him, look elsewhere."
5,A must have for the aspiring Jazz guitarist!,"Ted Greene is one of those rare individuals who has made it his life's work to teach harmony on the guitar. In this book, Ted takes you down the road to a greater understanding of how chords can be strung together to create harmonized musical phrases. The book is not for the beginner or for the faint of heart. It is best digested slowly - say a page at a time. The best favor you can do for yourself is to attack every chord and every phrase analytically. Play every harmonic phrase slowly and cleanly until you can do it perfectly. Take apart each chord and make sure you know what the harmonic function of each note in the chord is. By that I mean mentally (or physically) label every note on each string in the chord with it's corresponding scale degree - R 3 5 b7, etc. If a chord is named F7b9#5 figure out why. It took me over a year to work my way through the book. It can be done! Now go practice."
2,the book gets 5 stars but the Kindle edition gets 2 stars,"The book is great but not on the kindle. You can't read the notation or the chord diagrams on the Kindle screen. And there's no option to enlarge the images. You can, however, enlarge the text... Kindle needs to upgrade their software with an image viewer. Until they do, I recommend the hardcopy of the book, not the kindle edition."
5,Triple Seven Safety Siphon,"Bought this siphon to fill my gas generator &/or any of the four cars we own.Worked just as advertised ... couple of up&down; motions quickly starts the ""clicking"" noise & the flow of whatever liquids you're moving to & from. Once the liquid starts flowing, it drains a five gallon can in just a couple of minutes."
4,No more sucking water!,I use this for water changes on my aquarium. This thing is self-siphoning if you juggle it in the water for a bit. Very useful and convenient. Try to keep the hose as straight as possible to make it easier for the water to pass through and siphon.
2,Didn't work for volvo and bmw--and even worse,"I tried using this siphon to get gas from my Volvo and from my BMW.It didn't work for either vehicle. Furthermore, as I was removing the siphon from my BMW, the valve at the bottom became stuck and wouldn't come out. I had to visit a mechanic to take it out. . .Based on the physics involved, I'm sure this product would work fine in other applications, but I would advise against trying to use it to siphon gas from cars."
5,Works Great,"This thing really does work excellent. I used it to cycle out old gas in plastic cans into my car. The new CARB compliant cans take forever to pour because they don't have a pressure hole. I put the can on the trunk of the car, and put the siphon in each end. A couple of shakes, and it started flowing until it was empty. It took about 3 minutes for 5 gallons.What it didn't work for was trying to siphon gas out of my generator back into a gas can. The gas tank was too shallow and there wasn't enough room to shake the siphon to get a good flow. If you have a pump with deflate on it, you can still use this to get it started."
3,it worked great but it is OK,"bought this to pump the gas out of my blown engine car, it is really not that hard to get the pumping actions started like other reviewers claimed, however the poor design for the connection between the brass fitting and the poly tube, I got my brass fitting stuck and dropped inside my fuel tank, so I still need to take my fuel tank down."
5,Outstanding product!,"I bought this product because my gas cans have those lousy low emission spouts. Well, that doesn't matter anymore as I use the siphon now instead. Today it took me exactly two thrusts into the gas can to get the siphon started. And, it empties the can faster than the spout. It just doesn't get any easier than that. Well worth the price."
4,Good and cheap,"Works fine, you have to shake it a lot to get it going. Perfect for a gas can or anything round... may not be optimal if you are taking liquid out of something very shallow."
5,So simple a caveman could use it,"This is a great product, easy to use and fast also. Never again will you ever have to siphone and swallow harmful liquids"
2,this does work but...,it does not work good with automobiles. the little end piece will fall off. i am disappointed.
1,It Doesn't Work,"This thing was a piece of junk. I followed the directions to the letter and was never able to get it to work. I got mad enough at it that I chucked it in the lake. The package it came in said that it ""Works like magic!""... The only magical thing that occurred what that 20 dollars of my money disapeared. In the end, I had to siphon the old fashoned way... My mouth and a hose."
3,i will need one,i bought it because i will need it and not have it and also i would forget where i found it and i do plan on buying a nother in do time
1,does not work too well for small amounts of gas in tank,I tried to remove gasoline from my snowblower tank and couldn't maintain a continuous flow to siphon 'all' of the gas out of the tank. It doesn't work for small amounts of gas in the bottom of the tank. I'm going to try Terapump rotary manual drum pump which has good reviews.
1,Awful product,"My first time using this (I never did get the siphon action to start), a ball bearing fell out of the end and into the gas tank of my generator, rendering the siphon quite useless. Now I have no siphon and a ball bearing that I have to try to get out of the gas tank. Not only was this product a waste of money, but it was harmful besides."
5,Great product. Everyone should have on hand!,"Had a little hard time believing this would work as well as it does, but it is great. Simple to use and I believe it will last a very long time. I plan to purchase a couple more to keep in different locations and friends that have seen it in use want one too! I use it with 5 gallon cans to transfer fuel. As long as you have enough depth of liquid in the container to start the siphon you are good to go. Emptied to nearly the last drop very fast with no mess. Sure beats having to pour and spill or splatter when the wind blows."
2,Brass end piece comes off easy,This worked good at first. It was very easy to get the siphon started. The problem is the brass piece on the end came off in the fuel tank when I went to pull the hose out. If the end piece was secured to the hose better I would give it 5 stars.
4,Pump it!,"We've looked at and have owned a variety of siphon pumps and were intrigued by the simplicity of design and function of the Super Siphon. The downside of many of these siphons is that they tend to break, wear out, fall apart, or simply not function. The Super Siphon is an exception. It is well made (in the USA, no less), operates easily, and functions flawlessly. Employing a simple marble which moves back-and-forth in a copper jacket, a siphon is easily generated and fluids transfer quickly. The only drawback that we have noticed is that the six-feet of tubing is rather short for many purposes. Otherwise this is a fantastic product."
2,Doesn't suck but in a bad way.,"Wish this thing sucked in a good way. Very difficult to get started. Would only use for toxic liquids in confined container. The instructions show this being used to get water out of pool- would never waste my time starting when could just submerge the entire hose first or use mouth suction. If need to get something toxic out of container (such as gasoline) then spending a few minutes getting this inefficient, crude valve to function has a purpose. I have a motor scooter and occasionally need to empty the gas tank so will keep it considering it's not worth the hassle of a return. Will definitely not use for draining the fish tank."
4,Siphon hose,I would recommend this product to anyone. Works great.Ease of use fast siphoning once it gets started.Thank you
5,Great product!,We bought our first siphon directly from the company to use on the boat and liked it so much that we bought a second one for use at home and one for a friend who also has a boat! We got much quicker shipping and an easier-to-use web site with the Amazon purchase and are always amazed at what can be purchased through Amazon. In the future we will check there first!
1,Not working for small job,"I think this product is designed for bigger water like swimming pool, not siphoning the gas from my snow blower."
4,Not for small amounts of liquid,"I purchased this to siphon fuel from my generator, and this tube is too large to even access the neck of the tank. Also, this siphon is for containers that have lots of liquid, as you need to use up and down thrusting motion to start the priming process. So, a small generator wouldn't have enough liquid in it, and also not enough clearance to accept this siphon. But, for large containers with lots of liquid this will absolutely work."
1,"Did not work on ""Auto"" as stated.","This siphon clearly states it can be used for ""Auto"". It can-not! I specifically bought it to use in an emergency to siphon gas from my car into a gas can, to put in my generator. Hurricane Sandy happened. I opened it up to use, but it didn't fit down into the gas tank. Maybe its good for other things, but not ""Auto""."
1,Does not work for Draining Gas in Lawnmowers or Snowblowers!,I bought this to drain gas out my snowblower in the summer so it would not get old and give me starting problems next winter. Well it did not work! There is not enough room in the small gas tank of a snowblower to jerk the thing up and down to get the siphon action working. It was a real mess. I washed it out and sent it back. Don't waste your time and money. Big PIA if you know what I mean!
1,Nearly worthless,"Basically you can use this to siphon if you have at least a foot deep of liquid to siphon. Per the instructions, ""Move pump vigorously in an up and down motion"" does mean vigorous - you need to really shake this thing up and down. In liquids with just a few inches of water, you end up getting bubbles in as much as you do liquid.An despite the ""suggested uses"" of ""Cars"", the pump nozzle does not fit into a gas tank, nor can it be used to syphon oil, antifreeze or any other common fluid in cars because of the large size of the nozzle and the need to ""move pump vigorously.""Spend a few dollars more and get a real pump that fits a car gasoline inlet and doesn't make you go through contortions to get it to work."
4,Usefull,This helped me and my family during the Sandy Storm in NYC. We could transfer gas fromt the cars we owned but where not going to use during the strom. We where able to place and gas in the cans safe with no worries.
2,Doesn't work for siphoning from my car,"I bought this to be able to siphon gas from my 2010 Hyundai, but the pump fitting on the end that must go into the tank through the gas filler, is too large in diameter to fit. Also the hose doesn't appear to be long enough to reach very far down into the tank anyway."
4,"It does work, with a little practice","I haven't used this yet in a ""real"" situation (i.e. siphoning gas from a neighbor's car). But I did try siphoning water from my sink to my bathtub.As others have noted, it was tricky to get this siphon to work especially in shallow liquid. But after a little practice, suddenly it worked pretty well.I found it worked best when I moved the hose really straight in an up/down motion as opposed to just shaking it hopefully.I think the good thing about this siphon is its overall simplicity. It's basically a hose, making it pretty durable and also easy to clean.The downside is that the ball bearing inside doesn't create a great seal. Hence if you stop shaking the hose, the fluid will flow back into the source tank pretty quickly."
3,Check your end use before you buy,"I bought this to syphon gas from my cars to my generator in emergencies, unfortunately it does NOT work for this as the metal end needs to go into the source gas tank, and the metal end is too wide for either my Toyota Sienna or Subaru Legacy I suspect for all cars ), however the product does work great if you want to move gas from a Gas can to a car or other tank of course you need to keep the gas can ABOVE the tank you are sending gas to - gravity ;- So I'm not sure if 3 stars is fair, it's really 1 star or 5 stars depending on your application."
2,Didn't work for my job.,"I purchased this item to help empty the gas tank on my home generator. I thought it would be better than sucking on a tube to get the gas flow started. Well, it didn't work. I played with the metal end in the tank, pumping it up and down, and got the flow started weakly but as soon as I stopped ""pumping"" the gas flow quit. After 5 or 10 minutes playing with the thing I grabbed the free end and sucked on it once. The gas now started to flow strongly .. like it's susposed to. It looks like I just bought a plastic tube that I could have purchased at the local hardware store. This thing might work for other jobs but not mine."
3,Doesn't work well on cars.,"I have a few classic cars that often sit for a few months or more. I bought this tool to swap out the gas. The tool works well if you have a straight shot so it still gets 3 stars. If you have any angles in the filler pipe it makes it almost impossible to move the end up and down fast enough to create suction. I ended up making a tool out of two copper pipes in a ""Y"" with clear tubing on one branch of the Y and tubing on the base. I then blow air with my air compressor through the other branch of the Y and it quickly creates the siphon I need."
1,not for small jobs....,will not even start to siphon from a 8kw generator.....cannot figure out to make this work with any small device
5,Loks like I missed out on a good 'un,"I had been avoiding this album for a long time based on the bad reviews that it received. Thank god that Amazon provided song samples here because after sampling the whole album it appears that I have been missing out on some really, really good stuff. This will definitely be my next CD purchase and I'm looking forward to getting into it. I miss this band tremendously and wish that they had gotten the attention that they deserved."
5,The truth is not our governments top priority.,This book will open your eyes about the war on drugs and make you realize it is a war that is impossible to win. The conflicts within our own agencies allow the drug czars to continue to do business as usual and not have to worry about be caught.
2,Amateurish and disappointing,"This three-disc boxed set is amateurish and disappointing. As an avid Oscar follower and fan, I considered this a must buy, but don't be fooled by the lack of similar titles - this just isn't worth it. The series is dogged by repetitive footage (no interviews are included, only scenes from trailers) and monotone narration that frankly drives you crazy after a few minutes. Very little insight is brought to the Oscars story, and the few bits of interesting information that are included would barely fill a 10 minute segment. At almost 10 hours, you can see how padded out it is... And, to add insult to injury, the image and sound quality is poor and the packaging shoddy! If you're interested in this subject, buy the Academy's authorised book ""70 Years of the Oscar"" instead..."
1,"Shame on you, Image","I can't believe a respectful studio like Image who release nice films such as ""Bicycle thief"", ""City lights"" ""47 Ronins"" & ""Open City"" would carry this low quality DVD gabbage. The contents of this DVD is unprofessional and distasteful. This DVD really cheats and insults ""OSCAR"" fans like us. Shame on you! Image."
1,A very poor DVD,"Video quality is so bad ( no star )that you wonder why they put it on DVD? Story is not much better. If you like tabloid type of gossip,it may be for you. ""AFI's 100 years 100 movies"" is a much better choice."
3,good for one time viewing,"I watched it once. Not bad, but I wouldn't care to watch it over and over. If your considering it, E-mail me. Mine will probably end up for auction.I'll even pay shipping. boxman@mindless.com"
5,Just correcting the guy under me,"it was Mikey who said ""take it mikee"" not cliffy. cliffy did a couple ""1-2-3-4""s but thats it as far as between songs. This album was recorded in studio, but this was tehir EXACT show they did on the tour it was recorded (summer 98) i know, because i saw them on that tour and video-recorded the show i saw and it syncs up to the cd EXACTLY. i think this is the best live album i've ever heard. 5 stars."
5,Cool razor,I had a 710RL that just finally started sputtering after 10+ years. So I have been using the Norelco triple head system for years. I had a foil before that and won't go back to those. I only occasionally shave with a blade when I have grown out the goatee and need to take the coarse stuff all off after trimming.This razor is quiet! I was always worried about waking the baby in the next room with my old corded razor.... And the 7885XL contours to the face VERY Nicely. The individual movements of the heads allow it to go over the chin and around the mouth area very easily. I haven't gotten through my 30 day trial period yet so don't have a full history shaving with it yet. But the technological advancements in the last 10 years show.Price was comparable to the low end Spectra's and I didn't see a need for the spring adjustment for sensitivity.Cleaning has been much easier than my old triple head system!
4,Trusty portable razor.,"This razor has worked for me for over three years--still working but changed the ""blades."" It's comfortable in your hands and it charges quickly. I'd have to charge it every three or four days now (only 44 mins max charge holding time). As advertised I was able to charge it in India where we use 220V. Cleaning it is a snap, just keep it under hot running water and let it dry. It's a little bulky, you should now be able to get much lighter ones in the market."
1,Not nearly as good as the Norelco's of old,"I like others thought that when my 20 year old Norelco gave out that electric shaving technology would have advanced to new heights. Not true with this unit. Older units definetly shaved closer. The weakest part is the push button that releases the head of the shaver for cleaning. One must keep this area very clean or you can not unlatch the head with a simple pressing of the button. In my opinion, the latch is too small and ""too plastic"". Get frustrated and bang it against the counter to get it open and it will eventually break. Would not recommend for the cost. Time for Norelco to go back to the future."
4,"Good razor, tricky head unit","This is my third Norelco razor and it's clearly the best one yet. Nice shave, good sideburn trimmer, quiet operation, good battery life and you can rinse it off in running water. The little info screen is nice to check time left on the battery but the little rinse indicator is worthless. Do you really need to be reminded to clean your razor?The only problem I've found is when the head unit is flipped up for cleaning the connection is sort of flimsy and comes off occasionally. Then it's tricky to put back on, you have to hold back two tiny pins to clip it back in. My fat fingers and aging eyes don't help either."
3,It's only OK,"I had had 2 Norelco shavers that served me very well for almost 30 years. Norelco #3 was a disappointment, so I went to Braun and have been very satisfied for the past 2 years. A month ago, I purchased a Norelco 7885XL Quadra Action as a ""back-up"" shaver to my Braun Syncro System. In an effort to give it a ""fair shake"", I used it almost exclusively for the past month.1. It feels light and cheap2. After a month, it still irritates my skin3. The shave is not as close as my Braun4. FYI - The price at the Norelco site is $140Yeah - it's got some pluses, but for this kind of price, I would expect a better shaver. After 2 Norelco disappointments in a row, I think they have lost me as a customer for good."
5,It's Hard to do Better!,"I've used the 7886XL for nearly 3 years, and the only thing I've needed s replacement blades. I tried several different brands before finding the Quadra, and it just keeps on running, and running, and, well, you get the idea. AND, it keeps doing it with a nice, non-irritating close shave that is quick and efficient!"
3,Don't Replace your old Norelco with this one!,"Better looking and can be washed with hot water and left to air dry. BUT, takes much longer to shave and doesn't seem as close. Also, as time has gone by since purchased, I seem to be getting less and less shaving time per re-charge. The old one also had an audible signal when to clean and re-charge--this one depends on you looking at the small ""signboard"" every time! Old model also seemed to be much more accurate in the amount of cut whiskers in the chamber when signaling to ""clean"". Perhaps the new Spectra is better, but don't trade in your old Norelco for this model!"
3,"Good, But Still Doesn't Compare to a Blade.",I am a Gilette Mach blade junkie. I tried to go Cold Turkey to get away from the ridiculous price tag of the blades and reasoned that this Noreloco would do the trick. I've used it for 4 months. It's a good razor but it doesn't come close -- not even within a MILE -- of a quality blade. So I use it to touch up or on Saturday mornings when I'm feeling lazy. But I'm back on the blade. I'm still waiting for Norelco or someone to provide me a compelling reason to switch for good.
3,"OK, but not great.","Compared to other Wilderness Adventures Press, ""Flyfisher's Guide to..."" books I have read and own,(CO & N. CA) this one is a bit lacking. Fishing tactics and recommended tackle is covered well, but the driving directions are a bit vague and maps aren't as detailed as they could be. Also there are only hatch charts for a selected few of the fisheries. Other WAP books I have read included hatch charts/fly suggestions for most if not all the fisheries it covered. If you are a WA flyfishirman chances are you already have this book. Even if it's a bit lacking compared to other WAP books, if you live in WA or fish WA regularly, you should own this book. It just seems a bit dated and could use a revision. My .02 cents."
4,Missing Song,"A good CD but I'm wondering who is doing the cover of ""Wicked Game?"" I believe it is the group Giant Drag, but with 57 covers of that song it's hard to tell.The music fits well with the show and stands alone pretty well also."
5,Nip/ Tuck is the best show on television!,"Cleverly written, always has a twist and a radiant soundtrack. For Tara, the song is, ""Cars"" by Gary Numan."
5,most comfy goggles ever!,"These goggles are the most comfortable ones I've ever worn! When I was on swim team, I would get BRUISES under my eyes from trying to make the goggles fit right on my face. These barely require any push at all, and you can hardly feel them...no suction on the face, no headache from the elastic...and no leaks! Will definitely buy them again once these wear out!"
4,good movie,"I seen this late night a couple years ago... Would love to own it, and see it again. I enjoyed the movie, and found it interesting to see a lifelike representation of these guys who entertained me for so long, even though they are long gone. Worth seeing if you like the Stooges. otherwise, i doubt you'd enjoy it. Remember it is a movie, not a documentary. So while it will tell you about their career, it won't be perfectly factual."
1,Bogus Clams,From a medical standpoint these pills are completely useless. The enzyme Superoxide Dismutase is a very beneficial natural part the body but when taken orally the enzyme is degraded by the harsh acidic content of the stomach. This is a complete waste of money and the manufactures ought to be held accountable for fraud. Please if you don't believe these claims or think the enteric coating does anything whatsoever do a pubmed search and you will find countless scientific studies showing 0 benefit of oral SOD
3,Alright but the description needs to say the source (cow liver),"Super-oxide dismutase has its benefits, but I expected them to be made in a lab instead the source of their SOD is bovine (cow) liver. Had they disclose this in the product description I probably would not have purchased them. How hard is it to put the SOD gene in bacteria and make bovine free SOD? Seriously get with biotech already...."
1,oral SOD is useless,"SOD (superoxide dismutase) is a basic antioxidantenzyme like glutathione. you CANNOT take this orally.it is broken down by your digestive tract immediately.all oral SOD products are useless. SOD is measured byPIU or pyrogallol inhibition units, not ""mf"". one wouldhave to get a doctor to inject them with pharmaceuticalSOD every week to get any benefit, but there is noinjectable SOD available. a nasal spray would beanother route but this is illegal and unavailable.doctors need to add this to their medical practice.topical SOD products can be fine, but not oral.all this is scientific verifiable fact."
4,Not really new,"I didn't do my homework and assumed this was new stuff. Much of the album is the same as the Puerto Vallarta Squeeze, my original introduction to Willie & Lobo. I would have sent the album back but my sister was visiting, loved it, so I gave it to her. Willie & Lobo are in a class all their own. Don't buy this if you already have the original."
5,Amazing,I have never seen anything like this file. It works so good I think I am going to order one for the special ladies in my life so they can experience this amazing file too!
3,Rough Paper Comes Off,"This file is effective, however the 2nd time I went to use it, the rough paper came sliding off, rendering it useless. It's really not any kind of special file, you'd be better off buying a cheaper one. Also, I don't think it's a good idea to store it in the shower, as the moisture might contribute to the adhesion problem."
5,Best Product Ever!!,"This is the most effective and most comfortable product for your feet bar none! I wasted tons of money on worthless diamoncell files, electric files, dangerous callus cutters etc. This is big enough and so comfortable to hold I do not find myself scraping my knuckles while positioning my feet. It is pretty and easy to clean. I am buying the replacement heads now to make sure I keep this file at hand."
4,Snowy Owl,"Very cute toy--for ages 3 plus. If you give this to a child under 3, provide supervision and do not let it be a nightime bed toy."
2,Not worth the money,After several years I thought purchasing new replacement heads would renew my electric razor. I didn't see/feel any difference what so ever. Save your money and put it towards a new razor instead. Now my battery is starting to go.
3,Not good as expected.,I have a feeling that this replacement heads are not as good as the one that came with my shaver. Atleast that is how I feel.
1,Total mis representation Be Careful,"I purchased this after looking carefully at the Norelco website and the Amazon pictures.1. My razor says to order the ""HQ8"".2. The picture on the package shows a complete head set, heads and frame.The package arrived (with picure of heads and frame), but the package only shows the heads.The heads do not fit my razer. There are two little ""ears"" at on the perimeter of each head, but my razor does not have indentions for the two little ears.If I could easily get a full refund, I'd do it right away, but I suspect it is too much busywork to get one.Be careful before buying!"
2,shaver heads,I am disapointed in this product . It seems to me that the old blades cut a lot cleaner and closer than the new ones.
5,Replacement Heads,Too new for me to judge as just started using the razor but see no reason not to rate it high
3,Sharpen & Compatiblility,"Just a couple notes:The HQ8 blades are also compatible with the 7325XL, which is not listed on their Norelco compatibility chart.Also you can buy ""Norelco HP8 blade sharpeners"" for cheap, they are compatible with any product that uses these heads. I always make sure the device is compatible with these sharpeners before purchase, so I can always have sharp blades and never need to buy a new head.Vollco Sharpening Heads For Select Norelco Models"
1,"half the blade, disappointed","I bought this replace blade for Philips 7310XL. The replacement blade has less blade than the one came with the shaver. As I use it, it took me 4-5 more passes to achieve the same quality of shave than the one that came with the shaver. Do not buy this! add few bucks and buy a new shaver"
2,shaved heads not quite the same,"I am not sure what is going on, but this is the third time I have bought replacement blades and this time they don't quite fit my razor. They cut and shave OK, but they bind on the razer as I cut. It is like they don't fit my razor exactly. When I shave the razors stop as they bind with the inner workings of the shaver. I am wondering if Norelco out-sourced the blades to someone else as the new blades do not fit my razor well as they did in the past."
4,Works as expected. Shipped on time.,Works as expected. Shipped on time. Fit my old razor. The quality of the razor cut has improved but it still might be time for me to get a new razor.
1,Philips Norelco replacement head,Purchased new blades for my Norelco shaver. As others reported they did not last as long as the original blades. After 6 mo. I replaced the shaver.
4,Misleading item description,"The description says it comes with 3 heads/cutters. That means 1 set for a razor with 3 spinners, not 3 sets of cutters. I just got my delivered today, so i haven't tested them, but they appear to be the exact same as what came on my shaver (Philips Norelco 7810XL)."
5,Replacement head for shaver,"Works great, will keep on using these replacement heads until razor dies. Much cheaper than purchasing a new razor and when heads are replaced works like a new razor once again."
4,Norelco,The merchandise arrived very quickly. I have used Norelco shavers for many years and for the first two weeks it was extremely close. Afterwards the blades must have become dull and the shave was not as close.
4,Great BUY,"Great buy, price wise. The package did arrive completely smushed so I was grateful that the product was not damaged at all. It works like new again."
4,A Bit Noisy,The heads fit and the shaver does work properly but the heads do make more noise than the original heads. I noticed that the heads are a different color and wonder if these are a generic replacement and not an exact replacement. It will be interesting to see if the noise is from some sort of dragging that reduces the life of a charge on the shaver. The jury is still out on that.
5,REPLACEMENT HEADS,These gave new life to my shaver. Without them I would have bought a new razor. Speedy shipping and just what I needed
3,"Works great once you get it ""installed""","""Installed"" is the word for the fussy placement requirements these heads require. NOTE: this is just 3 new blades and 3 heads, not the entire top unit like the picture suggests."
4,Fits perfect,"The razor is two years old, should have bought them a year ago. Therazor cuts like new and my face thanks y'all."
4,Nice heads,Got these as backups for my razor not knowing how long the originals would last. Originals still going strong in 3 years.
2,Not anywhere as good as the original,Having purchased this razor about a year ago I knew it was time to replace the blades. I ordered the replacement heads expecting a similar shave as the new shaver.....WRONG. It is bearly better than the old worn out blades. What gives?
5,replacement heads,bought online to get better price than through a box store. bough them early to have when it came up on my yearly replacement time.
2,Not working like the one got with complete set,"I was using Philips (7290) shaving set from past 4 years. Battery backup and set was all working fine, just its time to change head. I brought HQ8 as a replacement, this never works like the one before. I have to make several passes to get clean shave with NO success.I might need to buy a new set !!!"
5,easy to find,I searched all around trying to find the razor heads and get a good price and until I checkedhere with Amazon.com I couldn't find what I wanted. Easy to order and received in a short amountof time. Thanks!
5,Norelco Replacement Heads,"Hard to find these in the local store. When I do find them, they are very pricy. Great deal buying these online."
3,Does the job,"This product does the job. I was disappointed that, though my razor is listed as compatible, the first two weeks after installing this product my razor indicated I needed to change my heads. Also, I expected the shave to improve back to good-as-new quality rather than remaining in the same ballpark as my old shaver heads. But, these certainly do the job."
5,good,good price and cheaper than cheaper than blade shaving. no shave cream or soap to buy or $10 blades every week or two..
5,Like New,This is the second time that I have replaced the razor heads in my Norelco. They seem to need replacing about once a year but my shave experience is like a new razor. Replacing the heads took me all of 5 minutes.
1,did not last 6 months,"I received the shaver head replacement in February. Used daily on my face and neck. Near the end of May the blades began to feel dull and leave much more hair stuble on my face and neck. Worked well initially, but closeness of shave fell noticeably after 4 months of use. Original shaving heads lasted 10 months, and were probably noticeably dull after 9. This was the first time I replaced the heads and hoped they would last about a year which is in line with Norelco recommended annual replacement.Shaver is model 7340XL, which works fine with new heads, but if I need to replace heads 3 times a year then this is not a worthwhile product."
1,Not the correct product,"The Phillips Norelco box (pictured) arrived, with series 7 replacement blades in the box. I can not use this item for my 7140 razor. It appears someone used the correct packaging, but inserted the incorrect product. I give this less than one star since the product is of no use to me and will be returned."
1,NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL,"These blades are not nearly as good as the ones that came with my razor.They left out every other blade, why, like everybody else the all mightydollar. Well I would not recommend these to anyone.Well Norelco your just like the other money hungry companies, and you just lost thisthis customer."
2,not a really big upgrade,I haven't changed my razor's head for over 3 years. I almost bought a new shaver but then I decided to try replacement heads. I was pretty excited after reading all of those great reviews. Disappointment came with the first shave.. I simply couldn't feel too much of a difference!
4,Great Replacement Blades,"These blades are direct NORELCO brand replacement blades for the Spectra razor. They fit perfectly and restore the ""brand new"" shaving experience that you may be missing due to old, dull blades.If your blades are more than a year old or you notice that your shave is not as close as it once was, getting a set of these new blades may make the difference. This is my second set and they really did the trick.Check the Norelco Website if you are unsure if these fit your model but other than that there is nothing to worry about. Incidentally, there are less expensive places to buy them other than Amazon. The shipping kills their competitive pricing."
5,An important replacement part for your Norelco razvzor,"Electric shavers are great for cutting short whiskers - daily or every couple days - for a while, but the cutters in the shaving head wear and can begin to pull on the whiskers while shaving.Thes factory-authorized replacement cutters correct these problems. They are easily installed, but you must be careful to line up the stationary part wings with the slots in the shaver head designed for them or the cutters will not allow you to close the head properly. It is a simple positioning step.Be very careful not to separate the movable cutters from their stationary housing, as they are carefully ground together for a perfect fit - and a good clean cut."
1,Dissatisfied with Norelco,I had used a Norelco triple head shaver for years and was not getting a good shave. Ordered a set of replacement blades and installed them (with difficulty). I was surprised the shave was not even as good as with the old blades. Was so dissatifed t began searching and studying other rankes. Seattles on a Four Head Panasonic and find it to be the best razor i've ever Usedom. Never New i could get such a comfortable close shave.
3,The feeling of a new razor blade was the same as the old,I would recommend buying a new razor rather than getting a replacement because the new one feels the same as my old razor heads. The cost to replace this each year makes this something to pass on!
3,Works but overpriced,"I'm happy to have new razor heads. The difference is quite noticable, but it is overpriced."
4,Phillips Norelco HQ8 Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads,Tripleheaders Replacement Heads arrived in the proper time frame and was in excellent condition. Was very satisfied with the service and was able to use the razor in no time. Would use this service again with no problem.
4,they won't be life changing,"your shave will be closer and cleaner but comparing the new babies to my 3+ year old heads, the change is not very significant. it is a pleasant change yes but if you don't NEED them then don't buy. might be good to have some spares though."
4,Replacement heads,I give them 4 stores. If they didn't cost so darn much I'd give them a 5. They last at least a year which I guess is good but I really hate having to buy them. The razor is just convenient for me opposed to disposeable blades which would be less expensive. There needs to be a generic replacement. I have even tried to resharpen them but it hasn't worked out very well.
3,Not as good as the original,Does not cut nearly as good as the original blades did. I should have bought a new razor instead of replacement blades.
3,the original blades were sharper,nuff said. as these are the only ones that fit my shaver. the original's were sharper. and why are these so expensive?
5,Better Than Ever,It was so easy to replace the old heads of my husband's Norelco shaver with new heads. He says it shaves closer and works better than it did when it was new. Can't get better than that.
5,Philips Norelco HQ8 Spect... Replacement heads,"The customer friendly website made it easy to locate the replacement heads for my husband's Norelco Shaver.The added ""plus,"" was the ""no shipping and handling,"" charges.We will certainly use this website in the future..."
2,worse than i expected,"The description is confusing. It says 3 headers so i thought that's for 3 replacements. However, it count each small individual blade as one header.A brand new Philip shave only costs 30 bucks, why do i pay 27 bucks just for a header replacement?"
1,Disappointed with Amazon!!,"I ordered a new Norelco replacement triple head. In my previous orders I received the item in a factory blister package with the package imprinted at the manufacturer with the model number and the name. This time I received the heads on a blank cardboard in a shrink wrap, no imprint of any kind. It appears to be either a reconditioned triple head, NOT WHAT I ORDERED. I am truly disappointed with AMAZON. I will not order from you again."
1,Does NOT fit 7800XL series like it says...,Wasted my time and now I have to return the item because it states it fits Spectra 7800XL series. Fix the description!
4,Dude Replacement heads,"Run of the mill replacement heads for the razor, I got the first review though!!!!!!!"
4,Didn't receive what was pictured,"It would be helpful if there was a more accurate photograph of the parts that will actually be received. The image on the package displays three cutting heads for the Norelco razor, in the housing, leading the viewer to believe that the whole assembly is what is being purchased. What arrives is three individual cutting heads with the cutting blades inside. What I needed, and thought I was getting was the entire assembly pictured on the package. I still have an unusable razor with a broken housing."
5,Vital replacement,These replacements heads will enhance your shaving experience.Replace the heads every year for optimal shaving performance.
3,expensive,I misunderstand this product. I thought it a razor because of its high price. When I received this product I felt disappointed. I do not plan to change it or return it.
5,It works.,It works. Was easy to replace the heads and cuts nice. No problem. It was cheaper than a new Norelco and I've never had problems with it before.
4,Head replacement was good,I found the head replacement was a fair price and it arrived in a very timely manner. I like it that they can be cleaned very easily by simply rinsing in water. Should have bought two but will reorder.
1,Wrong razor heads in right box.,"I ordered the HQ8 replacement heads for my 7310 shaver, came in timely fashion, but they did not work. Someone had to put the wrong set in the box, probably fit a different model shaver. Compared the new heads to my old ones and you could easily see that they were not a match, and indeed they did not work...the shaver rotors did not mesh and turn the heads.Called Philips/Norelco and explained the problem; they agreed that I ordered the correct heads and that they should work...much to their credit, they sent me a new set, yes, HQ8's, came today, and yep, they did work!! Same (identical) package that I ordered from Amazon, but different heads that looked like my old ones and did mesh. Thanks Norelco."
1,Shameful Price Gouging By Norelco,"I bought my Norelco shaver for $30. Next to it on the store shelf were the HQ8 replacement heads, selling for the SAME $30. So, Norelco sells a new shaver, with cutting heads, rechargeable batteries, and a charger for the same price as the heads alone!!!Presumably, Norelco makes some profit on the new $30 razor. The three cutting heads represent, maybe, 20% of the value of the new razor...or about $6 in value. So, to sell the replacement heads for $30 or for the discounted Amazon.com price of $25 is robbery.Norelco seems to be telling its customers to simply buy a new shaver each time the cutting heads begin to get dull...encouraging more wastefulness on a planet being buried in waste...thanks Norelco."
1,No better than worn out originals,"These blades cut only slightly better than 2 year old originals -- which are ripping my face they are so worn out. The new ones still hurt my face and leave some stubble, despite many passes. This high price would be worth it if they were equivalent to new blades --- but they are not even close.One star for making the packaging look like it's really from Norelco. Could it be a counterfeit? Or has Norelco gone this far down hill?"
4,Expected Replacement,"Product was OK.People in Mexico, you can get the same product in palacio de hierro for barely the same price."
5,Great Product,You forget after a few month how good new blades are until you buy them.I usually wait way too long before I do and when I get new ones it's like I'm not shaving at all.
5,perfect,this was shipped to me on time and they work perfect they fit my razor as advertised Im very happy with this product
4,Lacks quality installation instruction. ( Expensive),Lacks quality installation instruction. small 3 pictures (no words)of install does not tell all necessary details to install. Was about 5 minute from trashing and buying a new other brand electric razor.
4,Replacement Shaver heads,"In all fairness, I cannot yet rate this item. I purchased it as a replacement for future need. However, if it works as the present heads do now, I am well satisfied."
3,Poor Amazon service,"Excellent product, but poor service from Amazon. I requested free shipping, and I understand shipping times from date of mailing until date of receipt. However, this product did not ship until three or four days after the date of my order, and I received no logical explanation from Amazon. (Christmas orders from Amazon received excellent service, so I can't understand the long delay here.) They finally offered me a courtesy $10 credit on my next order, but prompt fulfillment of order would have been much better."
4,Replacement shaver heads - could be better,I don't know whether it's the shaver or the heads but the closeness of the shave is not as good as originally. Last set of heads lasted for almost 2 years so no issue with that.
5,Easy to install.,The first time I purchased this product from Amazon I had to return the blades because they didn't fit. That was not the case this time. Everything fit perfect and within minutes I was shaving with brand new blades. The price is substantially better than what's offered on the Norelco website.
3,hey I needed new blades.,I purchased the main item before. I don't just use this item on my beard I also use it to shave my head. The blades lasted under a year. A shame that it couldn't self sharpen for the price of the main trimmer.
5,Great Product,I'm using an older spectra and this is the first time replacing the blades for it. These blades were definitely worth the money.
4,very comfortable!,"The blades provide a smooth, comfortable and effective shave, without nicking and down to the skin."
5,Much Cheaper Than a New Razor,My old razor felt new again after installing the blades. The instructions for changing the blades were not very clear so I did a google search and found a Youtube video that explained it. Very simple after that.
5,Blades,Worked and fit my old shaver fine. Was delivered on time. Description was to follow to make sure I was receiving the right blades for the right razor.
5,Replacement Blades,"My husband is very pleased with these replacement heads for his Norelco razor. He commented that the shave was more comfortable than when he first got his razor,"
4,Philips Norelco 7340 Men's Shaving System,"Buenas tardes, alguien me pudiera aconsejar en un Philips Norelco Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads para una Philips Norelco 7340 Men's Shaving System.!!!Good afternoon, someone could advise me on a Philips Norelco Spectra Replacement Heads Tripleheader for Philips Norelco 7340 Men's Shaving System.!"
3,Short life for tough beards.,"Very pleased with the service, but these blades were NOT made for extra tough beards. My husband just received his new blades a month ago and has just complained about how dull they already seem to be. Then, again, to be fair, he does have an extra tough beard and there simply may not be ANY blade that can last him long enough."
5,Very Satisfied,I needed a replacement head for my electric shaver. Product arrived quickly and was the exact replacement head for my shaver.
5,Phillips/Norelco HQ-8 Shaver Replacement Heads & Cutters,"Very satisfied with the product. For an electric shaver, the cutters give a close shave. I have been using Norelco electric shavers for many years and have always liked the cutters. However, you do have to replace them every year in order to continue to get a close shave. Even though your electric shaver motor still works fine, it may make sense eventually to buy a new shaver as the cost of buying new replacement heads and cutters year after year will eventually add up to more than the cost of a new shaver."
3,"Kind of expensive, but they work well for 30 days or so","I clean the trimmings each night with hot water, but these blades still seem to dull rather quickly. I clean the razors with a toothbrush every 30 days or so, then I buy new blades once a year. Still, I can't get over the price for what seems like a simple set of circular razors..."
3,It works as expected,"It's a replacement part, so there's not much to say. Since it's from Norelco, then it ought to work as well as the original heads. That they do. If you have sensitive skin, like yours truly, it will take a few sessions for it and your skin to get used to each other. Afterwards, it works just fine."
2,not as before,"2 packs from the 3 were squashed and looks like old packs. the 3rd pack was ok.i'm not sure about the quality of the product itself, if this pack is like this.im not sure i will continue to buy it here in the future.thanksMeir"
5,Perfectly acceptable replacement heads,I thought at the price that these heads might not be the real thing. But they work perfectly. Glad I found them!
4,Could be cheaper if not majority will go for new shave instead of buying a new blade,"A little expensive but at least it works.Will buy again? Hmmm, think no......Buy a new shaver? Definitely Yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,as expected,"Arrived as expected, box was not mis-shaped or tampered with in any way. Came just specified and pop right into my razor."
5,Supplied as advertised,"I needed to replace the worn out heads on my razor, I looked up the number I needed, searched the Amazon listings and ordered it. The parts were delivered as ordered."
3,dissapointed in presentation,"I felt that the product I was purchasing was the complete head for the shaver and not just the blades and screens. Phillips / Norelco over charges for these necessary product maintenence items.NOTE: retailer delivered product in a timely manner in good condition. There was not a problem with the retailer, only the manufacturer and the presentation of the item sold."
5,new cutting heads renew old razor,Use care to select the correct cutting head model and you can return the old razer to a like-new function. AMAZON offers good price and delivery for Norelco razor heads.
5,Arrived fast,... and it was quite a bit cheaper than my local store prices. Product arrived as expected and met expectations.
5,always good,I repeat order because it is a good product supplied by a good company!and another six more words are required
4,OXO,The OXO squirting brushes is great. I love them. I can clean off my dishes and etc in minutes instead of using a lot of water and a plain brush. Do a much better job.
1,Don't fit!,These replacement heads don't fit the older brush handle. What a pity. Older handle you just had to push out the brush. These heads are a click type system that don't work.I'm now forced to purchase another handle. The picture and description are deceptive.Not worth the price to return.
3,This version doesn';t last as long as the original version.,"This is at least the second version of this brush head from OXO, and it fits only the updated brush head. These for some reason must be made out of another material, as they don't last as long as the first set. They work pretty well though."
5,My Wonderful Daily Brush for cleaning Dishes,I use my brush ALL the time and the brush does a good job of cleaning.I was surprise to learn that I could buy refills. Someone told me about it.I hadn't realized that the brush could be release.Guess I did not read all the labels.
5,YET ANOTHER WONDERFUL ALBUM,"In my eyes, you can't say which Harry Connick, Jr., album is the best, because they all display perfection, and something new in every song. Whether it's his soft voice, or his excellent display on the piano, it's all here in his album produced at 25 years of age, by someone who will go down in Jazz history, Mr. Harry Conncik Jr."
3,Simplistic and complicated.,"This album has the strangest selections I've heard on a single recording. It runs the gamut from Stardust to I'm An Old Cowhand to Lazybones and on and on. Why the title 25?? It was released on his 25th birth date. 'I'm an old cowhand' was included for his then future mother-in-law who hails from Texas. Harry is a competent but not distintive singer however he more than compensates with his great piano playing but one of his teachers, Ellis Marsalis plays piano on stardust. Great organ on 'Lazybones'. If you buy this album and wonder if your woofer/subwoofer took a break, the final track will assure you they're in good shape."
4,"Works Topically, Too","The proof for me that Gamma E Tocopherol is superior to Alpha E Tocopherol was demonstrated when I used it topically on a cut. The healing was dramatic, compared with my previous topical use of Alpha E."
1,Pool lounger,"The lounger itself is made very well...but I am disappointed that when you sit in it, the lounger won't stay up...it lays completely down...so forget using the cup holders and having something to drink...as you are laying down. Had I known it was going to lay flat instead of sitting up, I wouldn't have paid $200 for it."
3,bad company,"TRC makes good product but sells it through bad company named Willygoat . recieved wrong product. company said is was my fault.charged me for delivery, return and redelivery of new product. cost me more for shipping than for the floatstay away from willygoat"
4,pool float,"The product is very durable... the only thing i would change is to make it able to havetwo positions,,,,laying flat and sitting.otherwise it's great!!"
4,Good introduction for first time Holly listeners,"I wouldn't normally review a greatest hits album, because naturally they are good. If you haven't heard Holly Golightly before then this compilation of hits would be a good introduction. She is quite unique in her genre of music. Very few Women have been successful when it comes to writing and recording hard electric blues. But Holly's light gravely voice suits the style wonderfully.With ten albums under her belt she has a huge selection of songs to pick from, spanning ten years of hard work. The tracks here show how her sound has evolved, from bluesy garage rock through to alt-country blues, with the odd folk song in between. They run together on this disc beautifully and before long you will be singing along.This is great as an introduction, but I would recommend buying one of her studio albums."
5,Holly can do no wrong!,"Holly Golightly is one of my favorite musicians. I love pretty much everything she does. Although her style has varied somewhat on many of her albums, there's consistently a grittiness and realness and a bit of a retro feel in her work. She has such a unique sound and distinctive voice. Seeing Holly perform live is always a treat. She's sassy and modest and always delivers. This album is a good start if you haven't heard her other stuff. If you like this, give the rest of her catalog a try. And, if you've never heard Holly in her prior bands, Thee Headcoatees or The Bristols, give a listen--they combine a punk feel with 50s and 60s sounds."
2,Not That Hot,"The writing style of the book was fast with the main character, Nick Escalante, an interesting complex character that wasn't all that likable. However, the timeframe of everything happening over a few days forced the appearances of other characters to be short and sweet, and the characters were far from ""fleshed out"". I found there were a few too many ""coincidences"" that were hard to accept. ""Red Herrings"" weren't really explained well and the ending was more of a comic book ending than I expected. Also, if you don't want to know what's coming then don't read the dust jacket summary!"
1,No Emotional Connections,"I received this book as a Christmas gift having never read a William Goldman novel. Let's just say that I'm not too keen on reading another.I would give a quick plot synopsis of this book, but that is one of the main problems...it just seems to wander from plot point to plot point with little coherence. Each ""chapter"" seems like its own contained little story with much too little overall context.Also, the main character--Nick Escalante--is supposed to be an interesting character portrait of a Las Vegas lifer, but instead he is just a guy who sort of goes from one job to the next...nothing too interesting.Once I finished reading Heat, I had absolutely no emotional connection to either the plot or the main characters whatsoever...it was pretty much a waste of the time I spent reading it. Unless you are a hard-core fan of gangster films/books, I can pretty much guarantee that you won't find this book compelling whatsoever."
1,What the &@#^()@??????????,"I enjoy Dylan, but this album is incredibly BAD. The Jewish kid from Minnesota does his best to sound like an aged Negro blues man from the Delta, but just sounds like a toothless drunk singing with a clothes-pin over his nose. This is hilariously awful, but judging from all the positive reviews, it just goes to show yet again that once you've reached the pinnacle,_anything_you produce will be met with general acclamation, no matter how far your talent has degraded."
5,"Critics Everywhere, But Only 1 Dylan","This is an excellant example of Bob Dylan performing classics. Yes, he is older and sounds it, but the fact that some listeners and reviewers may decide they dislike Dylans voice is fine. The essential point is, that voice and all the messages and melodies are going to long outlive the myraid of critics. This is classic stuff."
5,Mesmerizing!!,"This man can work an acoustic guitar... And though it times his voice growls like a buzzhaw or honks like a goose, I don't think I would change a note of it. This is a fine work by an American treasure - a fitting tribute by a master to the American folk legacy. If there is any album you own by Dylan, this should be the one...Roderick Urquidi"
3,About some of these reviews...,"This album is okay, and I wouldn't disparage anyone who thinks it's great, but those who claim this is Dylan's best album aren't praising Dylan but insulting him. He whipped this off in a day or two at a time when his songwriting skills seemed to have left him. And no matter what you think of his voice (I like it), the fact is it's his songwriting that truly distinguishes him. His voice is a perfect vehicle for those songs, but it's the SONGS for which he'll be remembered. Calling this his best is like ignoring ""Blonde on Blonde"" while praising ""Self-Portrait."""
3,Dylan--Unaccompanied,"First: This is Dylan's first release featuring only acoustic guitar as vocal accompaniment (i.e. no band) since Side Two of ""Bringing It All Back Home."" Second: There are no original Dylan songs on ""Good as I Been."" Many of the tunes may be somewhat familiar, from ""Frankie and Albert"" and ""Hard Times"" to (the throwaway) ""Froggie Went A-Courtin'."" These two facts should either pique the interest of hardcore Dylan fans (""Hey! Dylan alone with his guitar again--Finally!"") or achieve the opposite for those who can't get over his voice (admittedly, there IS a lot to get over on this record). Don't let the unoriginality of the tunes dissuade you--they (generally) are fine songs, and Bob's performances tend to be strong. If you have open ears and a taste for unpolished music, go for it. However, if you're looking for another ""It's Alright, Ma"" or ""Desolation Row,"" this ain't it."
3,"Good - but from Dylan ""could do better""","It's perhaps not so strange that critics have taken the heat off Dylan - he's past knocking. But I would expect those who shell out for their CD's to be a little more honest. This is a better-than-recent release - good close-up mic, a collection of ""standards"", a go-for-it attitude from the man himself, and yes, by the standard set by recent releases from Bob, this is a refreshing return to a more rootsy Dylan. But it's not THAT good. Remembering the towering achievements of this spokesperson and craftsman puts this offering in a lower category than the 5 stars I see littered about this site. I love Dylan - his music, his resilience - his delivery of Arthur McBride - and I know he has more than this to offer. If you buy it, you are buying authentic Dylan for sure. It's just not his best."
5,Indie fun,You never knew what was going to happen next in this movie! It was quirky and made for a great movie night.If you like Indie movies you will love this film. Very entertaining!
2,Satisfaction not guaranteed,"Interesting concept but not made any more interesting for cinema. You wait the entire movie for the ending which is lack luster. Again, save your precious time on something else."
3,It was meh,It wasn't bad or good. I expected more like a comedy but it wasn't it. It is a chick flick.
5,Interesting and original,Romantic comedy with an indy film spirit. Definitely worth seeing. I can't really say more than that but Amazon is making me.
3,"Acceptable, and even better with a look into the future of some of the actors","If independent movies start with a disadvantage, this manages to be watchable on an obviously low budget.The story is quite weak; the dialogue occasionally good. Tries to say something about the 20 to 40 years old generations(different age groups are interacting), with some good moments spread out during the movie. Casting of the two main characters is correct, which probably buoys the whole show quite a bit. Appears that both are rising stars. Slightly embarrassing philosophical side, almost teen sci-fi stuff."
3,Not as good as the hype,"Given that this is a small indie film, I can respect it, but it seems to veer off and not solve some of the plot points that it spends a lot of time setting up. Too bad. It is a good idea. Just poor on follow through."
3,Quirky fun,"Fun, possibly aimed at a younger audience, I'm middle aged. The character Jeff was too shallow to connect with. It appeared we were to recognize some aspects of him to be redeamable/likeable, but his character was simply too idiotic to warm up to and it interferred with really liking the movie. If you go in with an attitude that it will be quirky and leave it at that it is a fun flick."
4,Loved this at the movies!,"This hasn't shipped yet, so I don't understand why Amazon has asked me to review this. However, I loved this,so much in the theater that I wanted to add it to my home collection. Very quirky and different. Fun."
2,The song's the best part of the movie.,"""Quirky"" has become the go-to shtick, and it's not just hackneyed--it's a dead horse. ""Juno"" was wonderfully fresh and funny; ""Crazy, Sexy Love"" was all the title details and more. But this new run on the oddball film lacks the characteristics most vital to a ""quirky"" or non-run of the mill flick: cleverness and a plausible plot. (I actually fell asleep about 20 minutes into this flick. Grab some java.)"
2,Sophomoric effort,"Interesting premise. I think this could have been a great movie with more work (better sound, actors, writing, etc.). Disappointing, although Mark Duplass' performance impressed me. The story doesn't really make sense.SPOILER ALERT - Kenneth runs his car into a guy's house who's girlfriend he has a crush on. So, basically, he tried to injure or even kill them, because he liked her. He later claims that she was his girlfriend who was killed by some lunatic who ran his car into her house and that he has to go back in time to save her. Somehow that's irrelevant if he is actually building a time machine and not just ""crazy"". Already way crazy on the first count. I didn't find the storylines created for Darius' coworkers particularly touching, either."
2,Not really my type of humor.,The lead reporter is not very funny in my option. I do like dry humor but not sure why I didnt like it.
5,go back and go forth,"""The mission is to do with regret and mistakes. The mission is also about love.""this movie struck a long and very deep note. we are all unfortunately time travelers, but the opportunity to go back and repair is of course a bit cliched. what really beckons is going back to renew and re-create.the film ends, more or less, with her saying ""i do"". those are always good words from a woman you love, and usually lead to great and unexpected things.for me, this film was a great and unexpected thing. if you haven't, you should go see it too."
3,Cute but Typical Indie,"This was a very interesting script, that was executed quite well by both the actors and director. However, if it looks like an indie, and sounds like an indie, then it will probably end like an indie...and it did."
2,slight movie,"Got this from the library and definitely wouldn't buy. It was mildly interesting, mildly amusing, and kind of a coming of age movie, coming to term with previous relationships movie. It held my interest, but really that's all. The lead actor is the guy from ""New Girl"" and he plays the same character that he does in the tv sitcom. The idea of the story is probably the best thing about it. I'm not sure why other reviewers rate it so highly. That Gone with the Wind gets the same 4 1/2 stars that this does seems unrealistic in the extreme."
2,long and directionless,I struggled to keep interest about halfway through. There are a few sub-plots but they do not add anything to the story as a whole.
1,stay away,"lots of plot holes in this ""coulda been a contenda"" movie. really disappointed in the fractured and implausible story. too many holes to fill in to manage suspension of disbelief."
3,"Silly fantasy, but enjoyable","This is a B movie, if you know what I mean. Not much expense was put into this story about a guy who thinks he can time travel, once he gets the right components for his machine. Two reporters for a magazine decide to check him out and see if he is for real. The girl becomes romantically involved with the scientist, who is unaware she is there to do a story on him. The story is a bit silly but we did watch it to the end, so it kept us entertained. But I'm not really recommending you waste your time on this one."
3,A Good Little Movie,"A good little film that is worth watching. Not likely to end up on anybody's Top 10 list and a bit slow in spots, but I would recommend for a slow TV night. The young woman from Parks and Rec, Aubrey Place, proved to be more versatile than her television persona would indicate. She was by far the best part."
5,Don't judge this movie by its trailer !,"This was just an excellent movie. I can't bear to watch 5 minutes of most movies, and I don't usually bother to give feedback, but this was a unique movie that deserves attention. It's not what you think. . Have a little drink and give it a try."
5,Great movie... Guaranteed,"I have to admit... I'm an Aubrey Plaza fan. I went in because of her, I came out completely pleased by the rest of the cast. This quirky movie is so well scripted and acted, by the time you get to the end, you're all in."
5,Very Fun Movie,"I impulsively rented this and now I wish I had just bought it. Aubrey Plaza is completely loveable as our favorite sarcastic ""whatever"" girl and the whole cast has fantastic chemistry. It made me laugh and cry and immediately want to watch the whole thing over again."
3,quirky and fun,If you like Aubrey Plaza as April in Parks and Rec you should like her here as she is playing essentially the same characater in the same way. Would like to see her branch out.
2,Don't really know what to make of it,"The movie starts off interestingly enough with a little sense of mystery, however the movie takes a turn for the literal and eventually lost my interest."
2,poor unexplained ending,it started ok then flattened off. Poor unexplained ending. Not even a glimpse of what might have happened. Not worth a rental fee.
5,Surprise fabulous,"Absolutely loved this movie. The preview and concept were intriguing, but often these artsy films are all trailer and no story. This one was quirky AND a great story."
3,It's worth seeing once.,"Corky, fun, heartwarming, but bit strange. If you like independent filmmaking, you'll enjoy this picture. It's almost like an episode of the X-Files."
4,Audrey Plaza,I enjoy this young woman performance. Audrey Plaza is a young and up in coming actress. Can't wait to see more from her. Good movie! Weird ending. But I still really enjoyed it.
3,Aubrey Plaza a standout,"Fun, It seems like I've met people like these before-not would be time travelers- looking for something else that is just out of reach."
2,Disappointed,I missed seeing this in the theater and couldn't wait to see it via rental. I was really in the mood for quirky comedy with romance thrown in. I was extremely disappointed. The dialogue wasn't that clever and the two falling in love did not have great chemistry. The ending was downright silly.
2,Dull attempt at humor,I cannot believe the volume of good reviews... Would not pay to see this. Movie dragged on in the beginning and only marginally got better.
5,Great movie,"My son got sick on a cruise we went on and we ended up watching all of the in cabin pay per views. We eventually ended up on this one and it was our favorite of the bunch. It's a quirky, well written, off-the-wall comedy and I really enjoyed it."
3,Recommend for a flight or to while away a rainy day,"I was highly looking forward to this movie. The cast, the context, the rottentomatos score!While nothing in this movie is bad, nothing is particularly great either. The plot kind of stutters at times, unsure where to go next, but more or less moving along. The characters show some depth and evolution, but perhaps it's simply too gradual to fully feel the emotional weight.Credit original writing for keeping you guessing till the very end how all three major plot points are going to turn out."
4,Quirky but good,This movie will probably be appreciated more by women..liked the relationship that developed between the two main characters. Worth watching.
5,More please!,"This had so much more to offer than the average movie in theaters today. There was comedy, there was romance, there was ""life lessons learned,"" there was sci-fi, there was a high speed 15mph chase scene in a busted Datsun 280Z (lol), there was evil gov't intervention, there was really good acting, there was excellent CG effects, there was bad prosthetics, and most of all there was a happy heart-felt ending. Couldn't take my eyes off the screen!Disclaimer: I am not related to anyone involved in this movie. I just wish the cast and crew would make a bunch of sequels! If they can keep the charm alive and not lose the wonderful campy look of reality vs what Hollywood pumps out, this could easily be Dr. Who with humor included. Absolutely loved it!!! Kudos to everyone involved!Anything negative? With all the wonderful quirky characters, there wasn't enough time to tie up all their issues. But hey, that's why there are sequels, right?"
3,"good, cute but not great","I would probably do 3 1/2 stars if that was possible. A classic little quirky, indie style flick and Aubrey Plaza is wonderful as always. Definitely worth seeing and great northwest locations"
3,Odd but entertaining,"This movie is not really about time travel. It's more about social misfits and the characters' attitudes to events in their past. It is quite slow moving but a good choice if you enjoy subdued, contemplative movies."
4,Fun film,"I enjoyed this film it was original and fun, however it was a little outlandish.I enjoyed the characters and the quirkiness of the film. It had a low budget feeling about itThough and that was distracting at times."
3,Aubrey Plaza,"I watched this film mainly because I'm an Aubrey Plaza fan. It's not bad. A little slow at times, and kind of two dimensional, but I don't regret watching it. Mark Duplass does a fine job."
4,Good film with a twist (or is it a twist)...,I enjoyed the film as weeknight viewing fodder. Good character development and story line. Recommended by me and my family.
3,I found it funny and thought provokeing.,"Its not a high budget scifi film. Its a cerebral indi picture, acting is good special effects not great but intrigueing. I recommond this film to any computer geek into Seatle stateof mind."
4,"A Sweet, Humorous Movie","What begins as a seemingly dark cynical plot about magazine writers exploiting someone who seems a little crazy creates a ""road trip"" movie with unexpected events. It's still a humorous movie; and the actors are all really perfect in their roles, all yearning for something that just eludes them because of something, (ie. age, sudden loss,feelings of being a misfit) they can't control. Without giving the ending away, this movie highlights the light over dark with imagination and a wistful sweetness."
3,Good enough for watching when you're sick,"I'm a sucker for time-travel movies. So in that regard I got my fix with this movie - but just barely. The characters are all caricatures, and the plot is a straight line to a place you know is coming. Still, it was entertaining enough for my girlfriend and me on a Friday night when we both had the flu."
5,Surprisingly smart and enjoyable!,"The plot seemed far fetched and predictable at first; however, the story unfolded into something magical! This should definitely be seen by others!"
3,funny but strange,"this movie made me laugh out loud numerous times and it has good characters, but the ending was super annoying and very abrupt. overall, i was entertained throughout this movie but it was definitely strange and the ending was disappointing."
5,Watch it!,"This is just a really, really good movie. I could write more but just watch it; you'll be glad you did!"
5,Safety Not Guaranteed,"A must see movie! It is clever, intriguing, funny, and inspiring - everything a good movie should be! I will definitely watch it again. I was not familiar with any of the actors in this movie, but they all did an excellent job and played well off of each other. This is just the kind of witty and heartwarming movie that will sadly be overlooked at all the award shows, but I believe it will have its own cult following!"
2,I liked this movie until the end.,"Potential spoiler alert (but no details)I was enjoying this movie as I watched it. It seemed to be developing into a slightly darker story than I expected, with a lot of human interaction, good and bad.Then, the ending.The ridiculous resolution to the movie completely erased any feeling I had toward the characters and threw all of my interest out the window. What a lazy finish."
2,Nah...,It's nice to see actors who mainly work on TV take a stab at feature films. And I'm a fan of indie films. Which is why I was disappointed with this effort. It didn't feel like the characters or the story were sufficiently developed.
4,Surprisingly good,Surprisingly good movie. Originally clicked on through recommendations based on other things we watched (plus I love the actor from 'New Girl') and it turns out it was a really well done film. Enjoy!
2,Seriously? That's how it ends?,"I won't give anything away here (well, maybe I will), but you know when the premise of a movie revolves around a man claiming he can time travel that an ending is going to be tough to pull off. This movie's ending wasn't surprising or fulfilling. It went from being an entertaining little indie flick to an abruptly over, absurdly ridiculous finish that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I would give this movie three and a half stars for the first 80 minutes and 0 stars for the last 10. You don't leave knowing exactly what happens, which can be cool, but only if you care."
3,Entertaining story,"Not a must-see, but worth watching. Story is easy to follow and characters are well-developed. Ending isn't what you're expecting."
4,Great Movie!,"A really well done film. A little quirky (in a good way). Great pace, great writing, great acting. Just a really good movie - one you'll think about the next day."
3,Best part? The 3 minutes of Kristen Bell,Local unemployed flake scurries about under the delusion (or is it?) that he's some sort of sci-fi Jason Bourne; advertises for a time-travel partner. Three Seattle magazine reporters track him down near the undeniably lovely Washington seashore to get a story. Duplass always seems to play unappealing characters; here he's a faxed copy of the nitwit in Your Sister's Sister. Best part: three minutes or so during which Kristen Bell appears. She's got more presence than all the others combined.
4,Entertainment Guaranteed,"Beautifully sweet and funny. I was dreading another chic flick, and this was not one of those. The dialogue is geeky, sassy and brilliant. Worth the rental."
5,it a great movie,I watch this movie all the time I like it and it was funny at all time this one of the best movie.
4,Good movie!,Watched it not expecting much but it was actually a decent movie that was quite enjoyable and kept me intrigued until the end.
4,Surprisingly entertaining.,"I watched this expecting it to be a typical art movie, but it was actually pretty entertaining. Definitely worth watching."
4,Fun Flick,"Great movie for those of you who are sick of typical romantic comedies, period films, and gun and car chase movies. All the acting in this is great, but Aubrey Plaza and Mark Duplass are superb. I hope there's a sequel."
4,Great off-beat light comedy.,"Nice to see another voice in the off-beat comedy market ... if you like Kaufmann, Wes Anderson, etc, this is a film to consider. I am often disappointed by films as tired, clumsy, and/or pandering to an ignorant public, but this was pretty satisfying."
3,Quirky and Enjoyable - Worth Renting,The story and characters are endearing and entertaining. This makes a great choice for at-home viewing via Amazon Prime streaming when you want something light that isn't so fluffy it will lose your attention.
4,A silly film,"I enjoyed this film since it was pretty ridiculous and the characters were silly. The characters made me uncomfortable sometimes, which I enjoyed."
5,Great date movie for those who don't usually like date movies,I can see The Notebook and The Holiday only so many times with my wife. It's nice to know that there are good light-hearted movies being made that don't rely on a central romance (even though it has most of the same plot features) to move the story. Also has a great cast and unique story.
4,A Solid Indie,My wife and I watched this together as a date night movie. We both enjoyed it. We were familiar with three of the main actors and none of them disappointed.
4,"Funny, sweet, silly and a little sad...",Good movie... We found ourselves rooting for the crazy people! We were surprised how much we liked it. Talked about it for a couple days after too...
4,Funny Quirky Comedy,This was a funny and quirky comedy/romance. It is very funny to watch the two time travelers train for their trip. Not a serious movie so if you are looking for a serious movie this is not it.
4,It was interesting and kinda weird.,"If you are looking for something interesting to watch, this is it. It has some very odd humor in it, odd human interactions and a really odd but cool storyline."
2,Not very good,"I had read a lot of reviews before renting this movie and the story was what I expected. The quality was not. Bland performances, slack direction and a flabby script makes a seemingly unique idea come across as stale. This was an extreme disappointment."
1,"Good movie, HORRIBLE soundtrack","I really enjoyed the movie, in spite of having to change the volume constantly. One minute the soundtrack is blowing you out of the room, the next minute you are turning it to max level just to hear the dialog.I don't know if this is just a problem with my copy, but it is something to consider befor spending this amount of money to own. Rent it first; $24.00 is a lot of money, new or used, to pay for a distraction like this."
1,One of the worst movies ever made.,Terrible script and worse acting. My wife walked out of the room after a half hour and I stuck it out to the end hoping it would get better. It was a waste of time.
1,Horrible,This movie was shallow. The characters were obvious and type-cast. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this. I cannot fathom why it's receiving such great ratings. I'm assuming that the reviewers are under the age of 30.
1,Like eating road kill,What can I say except that it started out well but then went off the rails and was searching for a plot or direction after that. Turned it off 1/2 way through.
1,Didn't even work,I hate it when you want to see a movie and it doesn't even work on the same computer system you use successfully for other Amazon offerings.
1,"Great idea, but fails to fulfil its promise in every way","The preview showed promise and Aubrey Plaza is charming, but the film fails on many levels by not taking the time and effort to show us how intimacy develops between the actors. So much time is wasted on non-essentials that none remains to actually make us care. Worst for this viewer was that the film fails to define what is real and what is not, and I can't care about characters in whom I can't believe."
4,I liked it.,Fun movie. Quirky and somewhat predictable but still worth the rental and time. I am glad we watched it and the whole family enjoyed it.
4,gets intense,"very good movie, i rented it for my girlfriend n i to watch (mainly for her) and i ended up liking it a bunch. very catchy and very well done."
3,The acting was great! But...,The middle moved too slow and the end was not one that I enjoyed...or it needed to be continued with a bit more.
5,Unexpected Thumbs Up,"Didn't know what to expect but the trailer was inticing and the reviews high. Ended up enjoying the entire film, which is very different to anything out there."
4,pretty awesome,this was A good movie. It made you feel like a little kid again . but at the same time its a great comedy/romance/adventure film/
3,Weird love story.,I was looking for something new to watch that I hadn't already seen. This movie was interesting but I wouldn't watch it again.
5,Amazing Film,Entertaining from beginning to end with multiple back stories that I actually cared about. Solid film that delivers on every level.
5,Moving and Bittersweet,"I wasn't sure what to expect going in. I was intrigued by the trailer and the excellent reviews, and I love Audrey Plaza's April on Parks and Rec and Jake Johnson's Nick on the New Girl, but time travel? Not necessarily my thing. But I absolutely loved it. There was something just so moving and bittersweet about Darius and Kenneth's journey, and while I wasn't in love with the other characters (Jeff and Arnou), they provided some amusing comedy to balance everything out.It's hard for me to know who will and won't enjoy this movie because it is quirky and a little different, like most indie movies. But I loved it. I saw it twice in theaters, and can't wait to get the DVD."
5,Funny and heart-warming,"This movie was original, witty, funny, and just over all fun to watch. The acting was solid as well. Rent/buy with confidence."
4,Very decent movie. Cast did a great job.,I really liked this movie. A strange story with an interesting group of characters. Beats the same old canned stories that I have seen time and again.
3,Change of pace Movie,"Weak story line but it is original and entertaining. Good acting for an obviously B or C movie. Worth a watch. It has comedy, romance, mystery, and suspense; although each in small doses."
4,The Ogeechee: A River and Its People,"There are not many publications about the Ogeechee River so I was glad to find this one. The photos are from a good many years ago but that is what lends them charm. The river itself is unchanging - yet in a constant state of change as it flows relentlessly to the sea! The information is interesting and informative. For anyone who loves the Ogeechee, this is the book to have."
5,she know her stuffs,"mariah know her stuffs, is very evident in her albums, she know what the listener wants and she do it with pride, wonderful album, never forget you is my fave and i love dreamlover the most!a must buy album!"
4,A great CD... what an amazing voice.,"Despite somewhat cheesy lyrics, Mariah pulls off this CD with grace and dignity. While I don't like it quite as much as her first CD, this is a sweet CD that shows off her incredible voice. I especially like 'Dreamlover', 'Music Box', 'Never Forget You', and 'I've been Thinking about You'. Good effort."
3,3.5 stars.,Mariah Carey's third album Music Box became one of the biggest albums of the 90's scoring 4 huge hit singels and Mariah became a huge star all over the world.Primarely Ballads. Music Box is a pretty good album. Her vocals are strong. The production is good. Usually it's about love but some of them have good message.Although I Won't say that Music Box is a brilliant album that should be wieved by everyone however those who like this so called Diva music should check it out if you already don't have it because it is a good album.
3,Motown feel,"I wont say that this is one of the greats of all time for music, or anything like that.The lyrics are mediocre and there is a lot of similar music.However it is pleasant music to relax to, or put on at a party. Mariah has a strong, attractive voice, and songs like `Dream Lover', `Hero' and `Just to hold you Once Again' are good melodies. She does a great rendition of the all-time classic `Without You'. The album has a good Motown feel. If you like that sort of music, it is definitely worth getting a copy.Mariah is best in concert as a live performer. She is an attractive, talented girl, and hopefully will carry on performing for many years to come."
5,Probably her best album...,"Mariah Carey was at her peak vocally on this album. Her voice was at her best. The production quality on the cd is also extremely high. If anyone's thinking about investing in a Carey album, then go with this one first. There's quite a few classics on here. Hero, and Without You are a couple of her most huge songs ever, and they both show you just what kind of a beautitul, amazing voice she had back then. Anytime You Need a Friend is the best song on the album, and one of her best vocal performances ever. The power and range in her voice is unsurpassed on this song. It leaves me with my jaw open every time I hear it at how a human being can sing like this. Just stunning. Fantastic album on her part!"
4,GREAT VOCALS!,"This album is older, so don't expect a Butterfly or The Emancipation of Mimi lol. Anyway, her vocals are flawless, and ""Dreamlover"" is an awesome intro. Music Box is an awesome album, and a good path to her future albums."
3,Carey On Autopilot,"Mariah Carey's MUSIC BOX seemed to be an attempt, ever-so-slight though it may have been, by the singer to branch out a little from the slick pop sound of her first two records. To that end, she throws out a little hip-hop lite in the form of first single 'Dreamlover', which still has its' charms, as well as the Clivilles/Cole house throwdown 'Now That I Know'. Those two remain the album's best moments--the rest is filled out by her trademark greeting-card sentiment balladry which, with titles like 'Never Forget You' and 'All I've Ever Wanted', all sound either pretty or dull, or more often that not, both. This remains her most ballad-heavy and,ultimately, neglible release(next to the equally dull BUTTERFLY)."
1,One thing....,"Just f.y.i. to neil906 or whoever- of course the Spanish version of ""Hero"" isn't going to mean the EXACT same thing as the English version! It's like that with MOST translations in music, you're not going to translate WORD FOR WORD because it doesn't work that way! So please let's do our homework before we open our mouths, all right?"
1,Get out before it's too late!!!!,"I had the displeasure of hearing this when I was 11. It's absolutely the most dreadful excuse for music that I've ever heard. Who or what does she think she is? This isn't music. This is crap. No other word to describe it. Mariah (the most hidious woman alive) should be ashamed of producing this load of bollocks. NOT MUSIC!!!! COMMERICIAL RUBBISH!!!!! I know you're in it for the money, Mariah. You don't deserve any of the praise you get. NO STARS, NO STARS, NO STARS!!!!!"
1,Music for pre-teens,"This CD just goes from bad to worse, and lets face it, the music would never get any listeners without a familiar face on the MTV videos."
5,Mariah Produces Another Wonderful Album!,"I loved this album, and would strongly recommend ordering it! From the first song, ""Dreamlover"" to the last one, ""All I've Ever Wanted"", Mariah delivers a stunning performance! My favorites were ""Dreamlover"", ""Hero"", ""Music Box"", ""Without You"", and ""All I've Ever Wanted""! Order ""Music Box"" now; it's definitely one of Mariah's best!"
3,kind of overrated,"the only songs I truly enjoyed are the ones co written by mariah and walter A which are dreamlover, hero, anytime you need a friend and also that without you remake. Mariah has a great voice and all but it wasn't until Daydream she was worthy of getting praise in my opinion. This album is just boring with the exception of the songs I like, I can't believe this one is her best selling album. I guess it's only cause Hero was such a huge hit that's why"
4,Musical Box...Dreamy,"This is Mariah's third album, the album consist of many great ballads. The stand out songs are Dreamlover, Anytime You Need a friend and Without You.Great Mariah Classic4 out of 5 stars."
5,Every diva has a ballad album.,"Music Box showcases the voice of our times. People only wish they could ""supposedly overdue"" an album..Mariah can take her voice where she wants, and she does. Sappy, yes, great album, yes."
5,Beautiful & my fav MC album!,"This Classic album is awsome simply put. Every song is a delight, of course there is the timeless HERO that cannot be beat, its one of the most amazing songs of all time, and ANYTIME YOU NEED A FRIEND both of which are so inspirational and uplifting. Listening to this album when your down can make everything feel like it will be okay! The lead single DREAMLOVER is another classic that is still played on radio today 15 years later! Two more of my favs are ALL I'VE EVER WANTED & MUSIC BOX. Last but not least my absolute fav song on this album is WITHOUT YOU. Mariah makes this song her own and her vocals are as always amazing but I think especially in this song. Its beautiful! This is Mariah's masterpiece & classic, its also her best selling record and a album everyone should own!"
4,Wonderful Album - expresses early 90s,"I liked this album very much when it was released. After listening to it, it very much grew on me. Every once in a while I would find a different song that would speak to me. I found all the songs, without exception, to be beautiful. It's definitively a classy album, and a great representation of the early 90s. Some people commented that this album doesn't have much variety, that all the songs sound pretty much the same. I have a great appreciation for this. This CD puts you in a specific mood, and it doesn't ruin it for you in the middle. If you are over the 90s type of production (crispy sounds), it's unlikely you'll appreciate this album. I'm definitively over this album now. Sound production matures from year to year, plus older people are less likely to appreciate crispy sounds than kids and teenagers. Thus, for this, physical, reason you may not experience the complexity of this music. Listen to the samples and you'll know if you can take it."
4,Very intriguing and a must read book!,"I thought the book was filled with insightful looks at the way people perceive others, yet often are misguided by their perceptions. It seems that depending upon individual circumstances human beings can run the gamut of emotions and be attentive or uncaring and uncompromising. The narrative style was very interesting. Mr. Kamau's humor and style of communicating feelings of faith, love, optimism, and enthusiasm leads to an enthralling read. The Tender Warriors Book Club rates Pictures of a Dying Man a must read."
1,repetitive and unimaginative,"the vocals are flat and the music is very uncreative and repetitive. i bought this album because of the great reviews on here thinking they were objective. the vocalists are a couple of bores. where is the emotion in these voices? the lyrics are beautiful, though. over all, this band sucks."
5,A modern masterpiece of electronic music,"I have been a fan of In Strict Confidence for some time now, and I think it's safe to say that this is their best album. Holy is pure electro-industrial bliss from start to finish. Gone are the noisy abstract tracks that plagued the flow of ISC's past albums. Alpha Centauri is the only instrumental/atmospheric track present...but since it's placed at the end of the album it serves as an excellent outro. Even though not every track is a high bpm club song, they are orchastrated just right to keep the listener stimulated, and the lyrics are some of the best the band has produced as well. The addition of the electric guitar in a couple of the songs gives them that extra dark edge, and the angelic vocals of Nadine Stelzer and Antje Schulz blend beautifully with the haunting synthesizer melodies. The conclusion is simple...if you love dark electronic music, whether you are long-time ISC fan or not, definitely buy this album."
5,This book is the REAL DEAL,"Dr. Lycka's book ""Shaping A New Image: The Practice Of Cosmetic Surgery"" is the real deal. In 300+ erudite pages it covers the subject from A to Z replete with answers to question you never new to ask. It is loaded with practical tips that can be immediately implemented into your practice. This is a must read at any stage of your career. I was amazed at the depth of coverage and the clarity of Barry's problem solving. After finishing the book I don't know how he found time to put all this sage advice into print. His golden rules in the summary are good reminders and worth the price of the book alone."
1,"Awful, don't waste your money","I am planning on climbing Rainier next summer and I was intrigued by this DVD. Luckily I did not buy this. I rented it from Netflix, and even their ranking system had rated it extremely low. While I agree the stretches and workouts are beneficial, anyone with any sense, experience, and comfort in a gym will not need this product. There are plenty of free programs out there on the net, keep your money."
2,Corny from the word go,"I purchased the DVD, Train to Climb Mt Rainier, for my 19 year son for a Christmas gift in 2009. Upon viewing it, he and his brothers (all older than he) were laughing so hard at the acting and portrayals of mountain climbers that they didn't learn a thing from the DVD. The high fives were corny as well as the lessons of what not to do to train for a climb. I believe that this purchase was a complete waste of my money and was extremely disappointed."
5,A MUST READ FOR ANYONE!,"This book is the most provocative account of modern battle I have ever been exposed to. The authors translate their experiences through the eyes of the platoon leader, the heart & soul of our fighting forces. This is a ""must read"" for anyone who wants to know what combat is like. There is more to the story than bullets and bombs...there is the human emotion that takes place behind the triggers. This is the only book I have ever read, and I've read almost everything out there, that takes the reader into the minds of the platoon leader. It reveals the challenges faced by junior military leaders facing an unsure future. This book has the potential to be a best seller and will move the reader in ways that no other book has been able to do. I cried, I laughed, I trembled, and I was humbled all within the pages of this book. This is the first time I actually experienced anything like this. Most of all, I COULD NOT put it down once I began reading."
5,Excellent handbook for platoon leaders,"I heard about this book a few years ago while attending OCS, but reading it took on a new sense of urgency with the possibility of fighting the Iraqi Army again.What these 5 young leaders did, not only during Operation Desert Shield/Storm, but also in taking the time & energy to put it down on paper, is absolutely invaluable to company grade officers. As an Mech Infantry Company Commander with no combat experience, I feel that I am better prepared for what lies ahead now that I have been exposed to this book. The candor of the 5 authors is a welcome relief.Thank you to the 5 authors for providing today's military leaders with a glipmse into the most difficult leadership situation known to mankind...leading soldiers into battle."
4,History repeats itself,"As a current active duty Army Officer, I am grateful that I have a book like this to give me some insight on what I can expect to encounter if we are called upon to fight the Gulf War again. I am struck at the honesty of the authors. They have approached subjects that are often regarded as taboo in today's officer corp. It is obvious to me that their candid dialogue enabled them to be better leaders in battle. Soldiers appreciate an honest leader and I will carry this book into battle if history repeats itself in the near future."
4,An okay read,"I was a M1A1 tank platoon leader in the 1st Infantry Division during Desert Storm and this book brought back memories of that time in my life. For a non-military person this book offers a unique insight into what it is like for a unit going off to war. there are flaws though, as mentioned by others it is hard at times to figure out who is doing the talking. One minute I'm reading about the scout platoon leader and the next I am reading about one of the tank platoon leaders without knowing I had left the scout platoon leader. Overall it is a pretty good book once you get past the confusion of who you are reading about on some pages."
5,love it,This swaddle design baby blanket was perfect for what I intended it for. A small blanket for my baby dolls I build. I will buy more
4,Nice but it is tiny!,"I bought this as a back for my son's Little Giraffe Blanket. It is very nice and soft, satin on the other side.It maybe an inch or so smaller all around then the Little Giraffe and not as thick. But it does the job at less than 1/2 the price of the Little Giraffe. I can't believe how pricey those blankets are!!Keep in mind, this is a small blanket. A baby size, blankey! Pefect for a child under the age of 2!!"
4,"Great shaver, easy to use, close shave","I bought this shaver to replace my Mach III blade. I have used it for over a month, past the amount of time it takes your skin and face to get used to it. Nothing will shave as close as the Mach III; the Norelco gets close to it, but does it more quickly. I have never owned an electric razor before this one, so I have nothing to compare it to. However, here is my opinion:PROS:*Shaves very close*Easy to clean*Runs for a long time between charges*Charges quickly*Conforms to your face well*Useful voltage converter*Nice carrying case*Contrary to a previous reviewer, it does have one flat edge where it won't roll of the tableCONS:*Trimmer doesn't trim as well as I'd like it to*Takes a few weeks for your skin to get used to it and get a close shave"
2,Too much of the same for Parker,"Being a long time fan of Robert Parker, this book was disappointing. Too much same stuff, not meaty enough."
5,"Wonderful, 7865XL beats my razor any time.","To achive the maximum closeness, you must follow the instruction from the small hand book included in the package. At first, you will not see a dramatic change but keep using it and your facial hair will grow to be shaved by 7865XL faster and comfortable every time. My facial hair is thick and a common razor's blade last about 3 to 4 weeks average use. The 7865XL does it in no time and close to my face. My face ends uplike a baby's bottom. The first use always take time, but as you progress shaving over and over on your face it get faster. Depends on your skin and your hair growth too. I can shave in less than 5 min and I have side burns that the combs can go around the edges; of course with some help from my hand. As I hold the hair upward, the electric razor does it job. What more can I say? You gotta try it to prove yourself wrong. And remember, follow the instructions from the small booklet."
1,Disappointed,"After using this attractive product for three weeks, I am returning it for refund to Norelco. Problems are skin irritation and painful hair pulling. Additionally, the shave is not close compared with even a disposable blade, despite using pre-shave conditioners. I was very disappointed in the quality of shave, because this product is well-made and there were many postive reviews."
2,Norelco 7865XL,I am trying to use electric shaver for the first time and I did not like it better than shaving with twin blade razor. I tried few times to shave and it sucks. It feels so good to go back to twin blade razor again. I think I will never try electric shaver again. It is much more painful than using a twin blade razor.
4,Wash & dry face first for best results. 4.5 stars.,"It's true what other reviewers have said: you'll get the best results out of the 7865XL (and the others in the 7800 series) if you wash and dry your face first. Then it glides smoothly and works in very few passes. I probably have to make sure I cross each area about three times in different directions (mostly going against the grain of the whiskers) to get everything. If I follow those two basic guidelines, my chin is smooth as can be and the shave lasts all day. If I don't wash first it's still a joy to use, but it takes longer (more passes in different directions to get every whisker) and won't last all day (more like 8 hours).This item is worth buying, it's fun to use... I'd give it 4 and a half stars. To get 5 it would need to do everything in a single pass, and that's a tall order.I also like the fact that you can rinse the head under running water to clean it."
2,Disappointing.....,"I read all the positive reviews on this shaver, so I picked one up 6 weeks ago. It shaves my face quite well, but does a lousy job on my neck and jawline. I had to go to an engagement party recently, and to get a decent, clean shave I had to break down and use a razor. The booklet says to use only the electric shaver for 3 weeks straight to give your skin time to adjust; but not only wouldn't this thing shave my neck decently, it actually caused a nasty rash to develop as well. I had to use Lanacane for a week to get rid of it. This Norelco model will be my last attempt at using an electric shaver (I tried a high-priced Braun as well, with similar results). Over 90 bucks spent on this thing, and I still can't get a really good, satisfactory shave. I can't recomment this product."
2,Not happy with this shaver at all,"I owned an older model Remington three head shaver for about 2 years before I bought this one. It always gave me a close shave without having to make multiple passes or contort my face.But I dropped it a few times and cracked the plastic head for it which I couldn't find a replacement for. So I upgraded and paid over $100 for what I thought was a quality electric shaver.I am very disappointed with this shaver. I can get a close shave with it, but I have to go over the same spot 5 to 6 times to get it smooth even after the so called ""two week"" waiting period. I just purchased the new Remington Titanium self cleaning model as I feel it will work much better, judged by the performance of my older Remington. I gave it two stars only because the flip up shaver works well.If you've owned a Norelco in the past and have had good experience with it stay with Norelco, otherwise, I'd recommend Remington any day."
1,DON'T BUY THIS SHAVER!!!,"I've owned Norelco's for over 20 years now and this is the worst!The side trimmer doesn't cut anything, the charge only lasts one week and the shaver causes a rash on my neck. My old Norelco's side trimmers always cut right so I think they ought to fire the engineer that designed this one. All the previous Norelco's I've owned had a charge that lasted two weeks so I think they are skimping out on the batteries they use. The design of the head is lousy; the stupid holes actually cause a rash on my neck.I know they say to apply less pressure but if you do then you don't get a close shave on the rest of your face. The other thing I hate is the external adaptor on the cord. The old Norelco had a slim cord with no stupid adaptor on it. The only good thing I can say about this shaver is that it is easy to clean under warm water, but what good is this if you are not getting a close shave and developing rashes on your neck!"
3,Just Not Close Enough,"After 30+ years of blade shaving I decided to go electric. I really, really wanted this to work out, but alas I'm back to the blade.I found the 7865 XL to be a very well built product and I think this would be a fine shaver for those with fine to medium beards. I think my beard is just too tough for an electric razor. I tried shaving with Lectric Shave and without, but by 3 o'clock every day I looked like I needed a shave.Go ahead and give it a shot. With the 60 day money-back guarantee you've got nothing to lose."
3,Not their best,"I really loved Pep Squad's album ""No Doy"", so I really couldn't wait for this one. It was ""ok"". It was still obviously them, but yet not as awesome. It seemed to lack the hook of No Doy. Some of the songs were catchy, but compared to, in my opinion only, the almost infinite enjoyment I received from No Doy, this one left me flat. Still, if you like the band, do yourself a favor and give it a listen :-)"
4,"A quietly beautiful, intelligent pop/country album","If you've heard any of their previous releases, you know that Hem doesn't make loud, brash music. This release continues their previous albums' quietly elegant tone. They wisely cut back on the string sections this time around. The songwriters put a lot of thought into each of the songs and Sally Ellyson is the perfect voice for them."
2,only one good song,"I purchased this album,but grew tired of it very quick.I think ""Kiss the Sky"" is the only track that carries this whole album.It is very techno,I suggest listening to the whole album and perhaps purchasing individual songs.I can't forsee playing this over and over."
4,Strange but engrossing story,Interesting history of the creation of the Bomb told as a fictional story of a clairvoyant who runs a diner near Los Alamos.
5,Mystery and Secrets,"This is an amazing story, well told. Waters maintains a dramatic tension between the inner psycho-spiritual awakening of the Woman at Otowi crossing and the nearby highly secretive operations by the Federal Government. In entirely different ways, the Government's secret work and the awakening of the woman at Otowi Crossing, both impact the world at large. After reading this book I want to read the historical information on which it is based."
3,Is as advertised... however...,"Items are as advertised however you get what you pay for. The headset is good for a spare. The cover works pretty well but as the other reviewer mentioned there is no hole for the camera. I have only owned the case for 10 days or so and the leather covering on the belt clip itself has come off, but that is not really a big issue since that leather piece is separate from the camera cover itself. The car charger works fine but one can tell it definatly is not name brand equipment.All in all I think it is a good set for $10. A decent case, car charger and extra headset... can't go wrong for the price."
2,"works, mostly","The charger kit and earpiece work fine. The leather case fits well on my Samsung E335, but they forgot to leave a cut-out for the camera lens. Instead, they left a cut-out for the blinking service light. Don't buy this if you plan on using the camera often."
5,I can read & speak French,I did not know any French before I read this book. It is very helpful to read and see the words as well as hear them on the CD.
3,It's ok,"I love World of Art book but this one was hard to read - the writing was just too confusing. Also, the reproductions of the images are a bit sloppyBuy it used..."
3,"Not Telfa, and not as good as they used to be","I had a box of the previous version of these, and liked them quite well. One pad would do for 24 hours if it stayed dry, and could even be removed and reapplied with the adhesive continuing to hold. The pad was woven cotton, and didn't get pesky fibers stuck in the wound.This new version says ""comparable to Telfa pads"" on the box, as pictured, whereas the old one had real Telfa (as the item title says). I'm guessing the item for sale is as pictured, and the title is incorrect.Anyway, I don't have an opinion on whether the imitation Telfa covering is better, worse or the same as real Telfa. But the adhesive doesn't hold as well, won't hold if you remove and reapply it, and the pad is spun cotton fiber that gets everywhere. You'll have to change these new ones more often."
3,Not Telfa,"I agree with the last reviewer. This does come off the wound fairly easily but it falls apart with the inner layers of cotton making a mess. I went to take it off and it came apart in layers with the non-stick layer still on my wound. It did pull off easily when I finally got a grip on it but with the other layers falling apart first, it wasn't very neat."
5,Good Stuff,"I had previously purchased the strawberry version and my daughter loved it. My son can not have strawberries so we got this one. It is just as tasty. They both enjoy them, easy to carry on the go and no added sugar! Amazon has the best price on them as well."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought two of these just a few weeks ago. I followed instructions to the letter. Neither of them sealed up very tightly. I'm not sure if they were poorly manufactured, used bad materials or were poorly designed. I ended up putting a seal of duct tape around the seam to give them better protection from the elements. I later replaced both units with metal boxes I purchased from a local electrical supply house - something I wish I had done in the first place."
5,Outstanding Price and Product,"Had to wait a couple weeks from Amazon, but glad I did. The fit and finish are as ""perfect"" as I could expect. The rear visors DO require tape however. Wish EGR would make a long visor for the rear power window facing the Sport Trac bed. Highly recomended!!"
5,Essential,"This important and long-needed book supports and facilitates the telling of the child's adoption story with the young child's participation. Every adoption involves loss. The most profound loss for the child is the loss of the birth mother. The book guides the adoptive parent and the child to her presence, illuminating the birth mother in images, realizing her in words, bringing her into the light of their world. An essential gift to aid the life-long journey of understanding for both parent and child.Becky M.Mom to two daughters from China"
1,Save Your Money,"As much as I want to like this disc, I find it impossible to get past two major obstacles: unbalanced production and weak performances. Bruce Kulick (Producer) had a great idea with this, and to have access to the individually talented performers included is remarkable. However, something went wrong with the chemistry. Suffice it to say that this is an aimless waste of good material. Obviously, I am a Coopaholic, otherwise I wouldn't care. I assume you are, too. Take my advice... if you need an Alice fix, buy the box!"
3,Poor formatting,"Formatting for the Kindle (at least mine - the older keyboard version) is poor. The text is interpreted as being in a table, making navigation around the page sometimes quite difficult."
1,return on investment is LOW,"for being such a thick book, they've left out a lot of detail & there is a lot of white space. for the DIYer, there's not enough hand-holding (details + pictures) to figure out exactly what you're supposed to do! i've found better step-by-step instruction on the internet. the book is not worth its weight and that is my biggest problem. why is it so expensive & so thick (they've used really heavy paper) for such an amateur publication?!? a big mismatch here..."
5,Porsche Manual is a Must!,"Everyone that owns a Porsche knows it's better to understand the basic problem of your specific repair, before taking your vehicle to an authorized Porsche mechanic or fixing the problem on your own. This manual provides detailed information on the entire vehicle and is invaluable to Porsche owners. Great Book...."
4,GOOD BOOK,Not as definitive as I like on some subjects. iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii iii.
5,porsche boxster repair manual,"great investment, will come in handy with every repair and project. the book is very illistrative and the price was the lowest i have seen,."
3,"Porsche Boxster Service Manual, Bentley",This is a necessary repair manual to own if you have a Boxster. I only gave it 3 stars because it is lacking in some details such as torque specs for intake removal. I would highly recommend 101 Projects for your Porsche Boxster.
2,Books,I have not received the books yet. I'm going to order again. It was the gift for my mom. It is sad that it didn't arrive before Christmas.
4,Nice Little Shaver!,"This is my 3rd Norelco shaver, and once again they have improved on their basic approach. This one holds a charge for a much longer time than my last, in fact I think I've only charged once in the ~2 months I've had it. Also, the heads move in an entirely new way (which I'm not sure I can explain well here). Basically, they still depress independently with a spring-loaded action like other electric shavers, but all three also push in at the center of the triangle they form. If that doesn't make sense, the thing to know is that the whole thing contours to your face much better and makes shaving easier.The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the trimmer, which is functional, but a bit wimpy. Still, highly recommended."
3,"Satisfactory, but Braun better","I bought the Norelco and used it for about a month. It didn't provide as close a shave as I was used to with my old defunct Braun, but I thought it was because it wasn't broken in yet. After a month of use, it improved a little, but I still didn't like it. I traded it in for a Braun 7505 and noticed an immediate improvement on the first day. The Braun was easier to glide along the face, caused less irritation and provided a closer shave right out of the box. The Norelco was satisfactory, but satisfactory doesn't cut it when you plan to use it every day for the next 10 years."
5,Face-hugging shave,The Norelco 7825XL Quadra Shaver with floating heads hugs my face for the closest shave I've ever had. A vast improvement over the lower-end Norelco model I previously had. I love the ease of cleaning: you can rinse the heads with water.
5,It's surely not the worst!,"I read some of the reviews and I don't believe that they do so much dislike it. I know that you have to have a special sence for music to like Jonhfru. But, if you once start loving him, you can't stop. I mean, there are always Synthesizers and stuff on his lps. i have to confess that ASITHOS was maybe the hardest of the six albums for me to get into it. When I started to understand the rough beauty, it really catched me.The best way to get to the album's soul is to listen to it backwards, start with the typical Johnfru-song My Life and end with the mind-smashing Sphere. Of course, noone should buy this CD just because he likes RHCP or the single The Past Recedes. This CD is better for dy-hards. I'm disappointed of them because only a few of them seem to have written a review.This album isn't easy, it's electronic, still some pop, but never mainstream. And I love it."
2,I would say it is my least favorite John Frusciante album.,"After The Will to Death, I was convinced that John Frusciante is a god. His solo albums like Shadows Collide With People, Curtains, Will to Death, and Inside of Emptiness are so great that they get rotations in my CD player, and on my iPod every week. This album, well, it doesn't get too many plays because it just isn't as good as the rest of this amazing man's albums.2 stars for two good tracks: Sphere, My Life."
3,Haunted Hearts,"This is an amazing story. It's the tale of a screenwriter and his love affair with the ghost of a silent film star.I think that any reader should be warned that the novel seems unfinished. There are quite a few grammatical and spelling errors that should have easily been caught by an editor. If this does not bother you, go ahead and enjoy the story."
4,MUST HAVE FOR B-SIDE COLLECTORS,"YOU'VE ALL HEARD ""DREAM ON"" BY NOW SO THERE'S NO NEED TO COMMENT. THE REASON WE'LL ALL SHELL OUT THE BUCKS TO OWN THIS SINGLE IS TO GET THE FULL VERSION OF ""EASY TIGER"" WHICH APPEARS ON ""EXCITER"" IN AN ABBREVIATED FORM, TO SAY THE LEAST. AS FAR AS DEPECHE INSTRUMENTALS GO, IT'S GOOD. IT STARTS OUT SLOW AND DREAMY AND THEN SLOWLY BRINGS IN A MID-TEMPO BEAT. THE SONG THEN FADES OUT AND THEN RESUMES WITH MORE PERCUSSION AND A SLIGHT JAPANESE, PERHAPS, SOUND. THE BERTRAND BURGALAT MIX OF ""EASY TIGER"" WAS AVAILABLE ON THE DOMESTIC RELEASE OF ""DREAM ON"". IT'S A FASTER VERSION WITH WHAT SOUND LIKE ACOUSTIC DRUMS AND A LOT OF STRUMMED ELECTRIC GUITAR. IT REMINDS ME OF MUSIC FROM A CHEESY 70'S JAPANESE FILM AND I DON'T WANT TO BE REMINDED OF THAT."
4,Good as an introduction to death valley,"I recently visited Death Valley and relied heavily on this book for planning my trip. Its divided into two halves, with the second half dealing with Death Valley and the first part with the rest of the mojave desert. It covers most of the star attractions within the park, along with some phenomenal pictures. If you are visiting Death Valley for the first time, this book is indispensible. However, I would have like to see more of the ""off beaten path"" attractions... for ex. I couldn't find information on such places as Falls Canyon. This is the reason for the 4 stars. Nevertheless, this book is a very good starting point for your first trip to DV."
2,Far Too Small,"Quality rosin this may be, I receievd far too little for what I paid for. The box this item came in was FAR too large for the actual product. This seemed to make the amount of rosin seem even smaller! I appreciate quality rosin for a good price, but next time I will buy elsewhere."
5,No shipping problems,"I saw a few reviews that reported broken rosin when it arrived, but I just wanted to say that mine arrived in PERFECT condition. I've used this product before, and have always been pleased with it."
1,Beware of Shipping Problems,"(1 star for the packaging by Amazon and 5 stars for the actual product). My son has been using this product for some years and likes it very much (he plays the cello). I was delighted to find a replacement for him available on Amazon and promptly ordered it. However, it was shipped in an envelope wrapped only in the soft cloth that is seen in the product photo. Rosin is fragile so an envelope isn't going to protect the product. Not surprisingly, it arrived quite broken. I am sending it back. I am writing this review because someone may want to order another brand of rosin that comes in a hard plastic case (rather then just a cloth) to save themselves the aggravation of having to return a broken product. This review speaks to Amazon's handling of this product for shipping more than the product's quality, which my son has always liked. Buy it locally if this is your choice of rosin."
5,Great Product for me,"Although I'm a beginner violinist, I can definitely see a difference from the crappy, cheap stuff, and I definitely like this rosin more. I really prefer dark over light, just to get that thick sound, and this is a great brand. I would definitely recommend it. As for shipping, it took a little longer than expected for it to actually ship out, but the shipping itself was only two days. Great product!"
3,So-so Game,"The novelty of this game is that it is a DVD game. The game is slow paced and most questions are easy even for my 13 year old playing on the hardest level. I cannot see how the easiest level is considered that as most questions asked in this level refer to filling in the blanks on a Bible verse and there is just as likely to be a tricky question even I as an adult can't answer. On the plus side, the kids do ask to play it and it has us sharing together our common faith. Note: this game does not play on every DVD player if you are outside the USA."
4,Good for mostly basic Bible knowledge,"Not a big fan of Jeremy Camp and his interjections during the game on occasion, but overall the game is pretty good. Never played on the easiest level and mostly got 90% of questions right. Enjoyed some of the authentic paintings shown that depict certain questions. Would recommend to a friend."
5,"Great ""alternative"" blues Cd","Henderson steps outside of the framework of your basic I-IV-V blues progression and displays a harmonic vocabulary that you would have to search far and wide to equal. His tone is great, his phrasing is great. Though purists may not like it as much you can still hear the SRV-ish licks (and even some direct rip-offs too) but he employs them in a fashion that is complimentary rather than offensive.Throw in some silly lyrics and it's just a real enjoyable time to listen to this CD.Henderson is a monster in so many ways, namely fusion, but in a sea of overworked and regurgatated blues players I'd say this one shines above most others too."
3,Take too long to sift,"Saw the TV commercial for sifting liners and then found these on amazon. These are okay and do what they say, but take too long to sift more holes, or larger holes would help. Otherwise, prompt shipping and service from Amazon"
4,Apparently these have disappeared again...,"Even though this page says they're in stock, if you try to add them to your cart, Amazon says that KV Pet no longer has them. I've been looking for them at Walmart for weeks now, too, and they're not there any more either. Ugh. I'm trying another brand...but I hope this brand comes back again. The material is relatively thick and the set comes with a large rubber band to hold the liners in place. Always worked well for me, even if they are a bit cumbersome to put in place at first."
4,sifting liners for Kitty,The only thing I disliked was that I wished they put MORE in a box; say like maybe 20-30 to a box.
1,Product change,"I have been trying to find an address to contact Alfa Pet to ask them why they changed their product. The first liners that we bought were heavy and worked great but since then they have been very thin and the cat or cats can tear through them easily, thus instead of taking out just one liner I usually have to take out 2 or even 3.They had a really good thing going with the heavier liners but now it just defeats the purpose because they are so thin. Ruined an excellent idea!"
1,Too Fragile for Cat Claws,May be good for declawed cats but not naturals. Their claws tear the liners while cat tries to cover the waste.
4,sifting cat litter liners,Very convenient for changing your cat litter. The liners seem larger than needed; maybe they could offer different sizes.
3,Used it about 6 years ago.. didn't have a problem..,However.. I am getting a new cat.. (I had to give away my others.. :( and I am looking to see what I can find in litter liners and such. 6 years ago I used Tidy Cat Sifter Liners too.. they work great.. HOWEVER.. I also used Johnny Cat for the liner too. When people came over.. they never noticed I had cats until one of them came out. AND I lived in a one bedroom apartment at the time with the litter box in my DEN!! I love the sifters.. I can't wait to try them again..
5,Good choice,"In the past we purchased these from Walmart, I guess they no longer sell them. What an easy way to clean the catbox.Have been using them for sometime and never a problem.Does require some common sense.If your just too stupid or unable to do simple things...don't get these.I highly recomend them.My wife and I laugh at all of the reviews from people who cannot get things to work right. Placing a rocket in space is ""hard"", these are not!"
2,Liners of Poor Quality,"Previously purchased this product from Walmart until they were pulled from their stock. I since have not been able to locate elsewhere, so decided to order 10 boxes online. After using the first box I understand why Walmart no longer sells this product. They must have had way to many returns, for the quality has been down graded. You go to pull the top liner up and the others stick together leaving the litter in between the liners? I doubt I will be a returning customer unless I can be convienced that the quality has been returned to its original form."
2,Just a thought...,I think they may have different product types because the type I bought at a well know chain store came in a box with a cat lying in the grass with a blue cloud filled sky overhead. These are heavier plastic and very helpful. You may check at your walmart pet center for them. =)
2,Don't bother with this book,"Since you can read about several of these great men of prayer from other sources, why pollute your walk and mind with a chapter on Madame Guyon and give $$ to an Author who doesn't know the difference between a Christian and a crazy heretic? 2 points for including real men of prayer!"
1,Norelco 8894XL,"The package is so darn pilferage proof I couldn't open it. Called Norelco, followed their instructions with desk scissors, still couldn't get the plastic package apart. Small sheet metal sheers didn't help. My neighbor has a Dremel, maybe that will sever the plastic package.Might be a great shaver, but I'll not go through this again. Cheaper and quicker to rebuy Braun often."
5,Herts and Minds,"As a woman, and one who does not hunt, I found the essays in A Hunter's Heart intelligent, thought-provoking, and often moving. They suggest a complexity and ethic which underlie a sport often seen as cruel and mindless. They make a convincing case that those who hunt are more likely to respect nature than are those who buy their meat neatly packaged in plastic. The writers voice a genuine regard, even love, for the environment and for their prey. The authors may be more articulate and philospohical than those many of us think of as ""typical"" hunters, but if we admit that one may subscribe to an ethic without being able to articulate it, may live out a philosophy rather than expound it, the essays may make us rethink the motives and morality of those who take to the woods during hunting season."
4,Stylis too big,"I bought the case for my granddaughter. She is 6 yrs. I like it and she really likes it. We got out our spare stylis and tried to pop it into the stylis spot. It won't fit. This is the stylis that came with the Nintendo DS as a spare. So now we can't have a spare in this case box.As for being hard to open and close, it was. So before I gave the case to my granddaughter I rubbed some bar soap on the two corner tabs and it opens and closes very easily. I wish this case was just a 16 game holder for the small games. That would be very nice. Overall I am happy with this. All the games will be in one place and clean."
1,Not so good.,"Just a plastic box really. We since found much better cases that are smaller, cooler, and work better for the purpose of stornig games while on the go."
3,disapointed,"this case only holds 8 DS games, and who wants to carry the little hard thing around with you all the time?"
1,Not a good design,"I purchased this for my daughter as she has a lot of games and I wanted a safe place for them. She immediately had a problem. Her Nintendo DS lite games snapped into the compartments just fine, but it was almost impossible to get them out again without breaking the actual game or manhandling the end of the game that you're not supposed to touch. With her hovering nervously nearby I ended up using a plastic knife to prize them back out but obviously this is not practical. We sent it back. I would not recommend this item."
1,pore quality,overall this game case is pore quality the games don't stay in place and it dosen't close nicely
3,not a game! (stupid star system),"the product shipped well and timely, the material plastic is not clear (as the picture looks) but rather is solid white.. and the material does feel cheaply made, but it serves it's purpose fine (note the extra battery does not sit nicely in it and the extra stylus holder is for a short style stylus, not the ones that came with my DS Lite)."
3,My 2 cents,"Shipping was quick, works great with my chocolate phone. I use this as a spare charger at work in case I forget to charge it the night before. Only negative thing I found was that you cant use the keys or features of the phone if its charging. The original charger does allow for you to do that-this one does not."
2,phone does not work while charging,"I was surprised to even find a charger for my older model LG chocolate KG800. The shipping was more than the charger, and while the price was great, this charger was not. My phone did strange things while charging, for example when dialing number '8' it would display a '3' or maybe a '6'. It did indicate that the phone was charging, but I don't trust it properly charge the phone."
3,Charger does not work with newer LG phones,This charger has been found to be incompatible with a LG GT365 Neon phone. Charger does not initialize the phone into the charge mode which causes the phone to emit a ring sound every second.
2,fell apart,"i think the title says it all. to be fair, i should have been more gentle. i was removing it from a wall socket, and the plastic cracked between the prongs. one of the prongs stayed in the wall (bare metal), which was a pain to remove."
2,"Neat, easy install, But disappointing performance","It is really well made and easy to install. The instructions are thorough and complete. However, the first problem that developed was that t takes several attempts to get it to turn on (green light) and then the intensity must be adjusted every time. It is supposed to have a ""sleep"" mode (not much going on) and then ""wake-up"" when things happen (gear down, engine changes, etc) but mine doesn't. All-in-all a disappointment.Unfortunately I had the unit a number of weeks before using it and was slow in realizing the flaws. As a result I missed the deadline for refund or replacement.If you buy this unit please check it out right away. Hopefully, it will operate as advertised but, if not, you will be able to do something about it.I am going back to my Dayton/Astra setup."
5,Good vibrations.......,"Really enhances any game with seat of your pants feeling, like oh, flight simulators, driving games, etc. With some imagination, you can connect this to pretty much anything cylindrical you can wrap the clamp onto.....including, well, use your imagination."
4,Not a bad product,I got this to hold me over while I wait to get the full buttkicker lfe kit. This is a pretty nice addition to gaming. pickup for sure!
5,Buttkicker Gamer Review,"Purchased this product and have been testing this item for 1 month. This item gives you everything you would want to feel like your in the game. With its high and low gain, the amplifier works the way its should. Giving you the best experiance in game. You can feel every loud explosion and also the slightist sounds in game. If you want something to enhance your game play, if it be Game Console or PC this is the item for you."
5,Adding a whole nother dimension,"I've been using the gamer for 4 months now with my computer and PS2 games. With this little thing I can FEEL every single explosion and bump and thump. Hearing all these things is one thing, but when you can actually feel it too, it adds a whole nother dimension to my gaming and even my music listening."
5,Awesome (when working),"Where has this product been all my life? I could never let a subwoofer rip without disturbing everyone around me. Now I can get the same effect without risk of hearing loss (and disturbing the peace). Excellent!Pros:* Movies* Music* FPS Games: Tried in Counter-Strike:Source, BF2142, and HL2:EmpiresModCons:* RTS Games: Supreme Commander and Earth2160 are better without it IMO* Requires sound card with bass boost (such as X-Fi gamer) for best results (albeit it works surprisingly well off a crappy laptop headphone output)UPDATE: Bought this less than a year ago, and it has now died. The ""signal"" and ""clip"" leds are not lighting up at all, although the power led and fan turn on. Prior to failure, I was getting erratic behavior from the unit (would rumble periodically with no input). I used this unit almost purely for gaming and turned it off when not using it.UPDATE 2: I'm now on my third amplifier. I still really like the darn thing, but I'm scared of turning up the volume..."
2,Decent examples but not much encouragement,"It seems like the dual purposes of this book were to teach the basics of writing poetry and discourage anyone from doing it. When the author sticks to facts and discusses examples, the text moves fine. Many of the poems included are good at illustrating what she is discussing. Whenever she starts talking about real ""poets"" or ""poetry"" the tone becomes condescending and judgmental.Far too much of this book is spent trying to deflate the supposed desire for poetry superstardom (hah!) and not enough on encouraging people who are new to poetry to give it a try and do something new. Find a better book that will give you the basics without the editorializing."
5,"Fast, Clear, and Helpful",One of the most important things about this book was that it really helped me put a rudder in the water when it comes to poetry. I've always written here and there but my poems always sounded like greeting cards. The exercises and poems in this book have really helped me grow and to feel like I'm finally starting to write poems that sound like they could only come from me.
5,Very Insightful Guide to the Art of Writing Poetry,"This book is great for beginners and those with a knowledge poetry alike. I wrote a lot of poetry when I was in college because I had a lot of free time, but once I entered the work force I became blocked and couldn't write with so little time. This book helped me look at writing poetry in a new way that facilitates the process and allows me to finish poems in days rather than weeks. I really recommend this book to anyone that wants to be considered a poet."
5,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing Poetry.,"I am very impressed with the ease in which this book makes the subject of poetry. I am now able to write a nice poem. I began writing poetry after reading the 2nd chapter. It made the use of rhyme, stanzas, meter and imigary easy to understand. It also covers the areas of publication and journaling.If writing poetry interestes you, then journey through the Idiot's Guide, embarking on a verbal path.I said I started writing poetry. I didn't say good poetry!"
4,Good book for beginning poets,Every poets needs to begin somewhere and this book is a good beginning. It is easy to read and gives some good advice for those who are interested in writing poetry but aren't sure where to start. I recommend it.
4,A must read for all kids young and old,"I never laugh so hard in my life, my class loved this book so much that I been reading it everyday since I brought it to read to my class. If your an adult you understand with the kids what they go through with their mother being differnt. The pictures within in the book makes it a page turn. If you want to buy a great author and a really funny book buy this one!"
2,Most tracks aren't the original versions!,"Don't get me wrong here. I love Kinky's music. But this CD is a disappointment, as most of the tracks on it are live cuts, not original studio cuts.Kinky classics like ""Get Your Biscuits In The Oven And Your Buns In The Bed,"" ""We Reserve The Right To Refuse Service To You,"" ""Homo Erectus,"" and (gasp!) ""They Ain't Makin' Jews Like Jesus Anymore"" are not present in their original versions, but rather inferior live cuts. This collection has other cuts from the Sold American and Kinky Friedman albums; why couldn't the above songs be included in their original versions?Overall, this CD could have been great, but it's a disappointment."
4,Great beginer for all just getting introduced to investments,"Mr. Tyson has a good approach at explaining the ins and outs of the investing world without all the technical jargon. He summarizes different aspects of investments from stocks/bonds/mutual funds and real estate. He does not leave out the fact that any investing is risky, and one should do his/her homework before taking the risk. But without risk there is no reward. This is a good intro into investments when one is ready to move on to more technical novels. Definitely give it a look over."
1,Lacking - as a stand alone product,This review is for the audio version only. The book may have had documents and examples that may prove more useful.In the audio format there proved to be very few good nuggets of information.I listened to the entire audio version in my car on the way to work. I didn't have to stop once to jot down anything important.It is too bad the disk didn't have a few .pdf files that could have been printed off to support the content of the book.I would suggest one of Peter Lynch's books instead
5,Great Value,These filters do a great job of cleaning the air in my house. I leave the furnace fans run 24/7 to keep air movement throughout the house and since switching to the 3M Filtrete line of filters I have seen a drastic reduction of dust settlement on furniture throughout the week and the air smells fresh!
2,Disappointing,This book is a mish mash of recycled and rehashed Dracula Stories (though- not stooping too low as to include Peewee vs Dracula).Though some of the stories might spark your interest.... for a while. Instead of something to keep you sleepless- this book has degenerated to an alternative cure for insomnia.
1,Mine is off by 9 degrees,The Little Havana hygrometer I was sent is 9 degrees over actual humidity & can't be calibrated. I wrote -9 on the LCD with a Sharpie to remember actual level. The Caliber 2 hygrometer I bought is 1 degree over actual humidity.
2,"The form factor only is the only ""pro"" of this hygrometer","Ordered a unit three weeks ago, arrived in good packaging, however the temperature readout was faulty. Contacted customer service, they quickly sent me a second unit at no cost. The temperature readout on the replacement works fine, but the hygrometer reads 6% below the known source. This hygrometer cannot be adjusted. Look for other (adjustable) options. Possibly a defective production run of these devices. Too bad, I sure liked the form factor."
1,Not accurate,I bought two of them and they both have different relative humidity readings. They differ by like 10%. Neither one of the two I purchased is accurate and there is no way to adjust the reading. Dont buy this product it is a waste of money!
2,Little Havana Hydrometer,"Perfect size for a humidor; blends right in with my other sticks. Taking the cover off to remove the paper tab to activate the battery was a pain. The cover doesn't seem to fit properly unless I keep the magnet on the back. After performing a salt calibration test, the readout was 67. There is a calibration reset button, but no adjustment feature. Hence the readout will always be 8% off. My current readout is now 60%. I use a 69% Boveda pack to maintain humidity, so as long as you don't mind doing a little math it works.(+/- 2%) I'm a little bit of a stickler for details so I'll probably replace it in the future."
4,working great for 2+ years now,"I purchased this in 2010 for my large humidor. I alos purchased severla other top sellers and compared this, it was dead accurate out of the box. I still have yet to change the battery and it is still acccurate. I did a salt test the other week and it was sill dead on! Great product, will buy again.Only downside was not able to calibrate the thing. But when its this accurate, i guess there is no need."
3,Semi accurate,I was looking for a digital hygro to use along with my analog just for peace of mind. After calibrating with a Boveda pack I noticed it was +5. Huge difference! But I made the note and it has read constant in my humidor. It's still +5 but aside from that has been accurate along with my analog hygro. Can't say I'd recommend though!
1,Not work'n,This digital hygrometer worked for about 2 weeks then when south by about 15% accuracy..is reading 66% humidity when it should be 78%. This compared against my analog hygrometer which I calibrate with salt slurry and zip bag. Also compared to my Caliber III digital hygrometer which stays with-in 1%-2%. I do not recomend the Little Havanna.
2,Battery or LCD keeps dying.,"I was sent a replacement and it died a month later. I haven't tried a new battery yet. I don't know if it is the battery or LCD? Either way, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Not well made - but works ok after I repaired it.,"I had to send back the first one I received because display was fading in and out. The second one also had a faulty display, but figuring I could be sending these back several times before they got it right, I took a small phillips head-screw driver and fixed the problem by tightening the back myself.But the purchasing of one of these units should not be a do-it-yourself project.The humidity reading is also off by about 3%, but I can live with that by just factoring the difference when doing a reading.Update: I have had this about 5 months now. Since it is holding an accurate reading since I initally fixed it and is working properly, I have upgraded the rating from 1 star to 2, but I still have issues with their quality control."
5,great little hygrometer,"I purchased this hygrometer several weeks ago and it has been well worth it. It doesn't have too many bells and whistles, but lets face it, all it really does is sit in your humidor all day. it gives max and min values for temp and humidity and is extremely easy to use. put in the batteries and put it in your humidor. I had 2 cheap hygrometers that would read different levels even though they were both calibrated at the same time in the same method. The little havana made both of them useless. My smokes now burn more evenly and are a much greater pleasure to smoke."
2,A little boring,"Of course it's an essential book for grammar, but it does not have to be so boring! Hope they improve it."
5,Worth it!,Very nice little compact book! Worth it for anyone who is struggling with difficult Russian grammar.
3,Handy little book,The other reviews I had read here were somewhat negative but given the low price I thought I would take a chance. When the book arrived I was surprised at how short it was and therefore had low expectations. However when I started reading it was was pleasantly surprised at how complete it was. I would not recommend it as a first or only book but as a handy guide or refresher to look up common grammar stuff it's great. If you are like me and have made a folder of notes for the common stuff to save wadding through reference books then this could be a handy alternative.
4,Better than the first half,"This second half of Shai's world is more satisfying than the first half. While this is a pretty good story it leaves too much to the imagination on the future of Shai's character. Enjoyable, as it is written in the style of C J Cherryh, not quite satisfying as if it were her story.Really two novellas that would make one smallish novel by today's standards. It feels like there should be a part three to be complete... But I haven't found a clue that one exist. But if you are a Cherryh addict like me, you will still enjoy this story."
5,The very moment is very special.,"This is a great easy-to-read book by a real master. He presents the material in a digestible manner. Nothing too ""Zenny"" to handle. I really enjoyed reading it at night before bed. I often go back to it when I want some really light reading that has a profound meaning for my day."
5,A Must Have Book,"This book is a ""must have"" in your home. I keep copies in my guest room and on my livingroom sofa table. Most of my guests ask for a copy of the book to take with them. The artwork is lovely and the writing makes us hope that the author has truly had a chance to view Heaven firsthand! You won't regret buying this book!!!!"
5,Latte with panache,"I have searched for mugs like these for a long time and am delighted to have found them at Amazon! Curling up in a warm, cozy blanket on a cool night enjoying a latte in these unique mugs turns an ordinary evening into a relaxing experience. Thank you for offering them at Amazon."
1,Okay if you want broken glass,These items arrived in a million pieces. Not packed well. I returned them with no problem.
1,????????,"I ordered the colombian 8 o clock coffee and got the regular 8 o clock coffee, so I have no idea how to rate this!?!?!?"
2,Very small!,This bracelet is of good quality with a nice clasp. It's good looking but it is so small. I have a very small and thin wrist and it is tight with very little slack. It's so small that it's kind of uncomfortable. This seems to have been made for a child but it was not marked that way.
3,Needs a revision,"After taking the exam in December 2006, you would be better off buying and reviewing the latest version of Campbell Reece 'Biology' textbook to study for the GRE Biology Exam. This Kaplan book needs a revision as it is misrepresenting a lot of the information that was presented on the exam.I would say that this book is good reference for a high school biology teacher."
2,Really -- save your money,"This book is accessible and covers much of the exam material in the depth you need to know it. However, it glosses over plant biology (a very major component of the exam) as well as much of the animal physiology and evolution material it contains. It was very frustrating on exam day to see all kinds of information not covered in this book -- and I'm not talking specifics here but GENERAL CONCEPTS. If your undergraduate biology study was more focused (i.e. you haven't had development or plant bio or physiology or evolution or cell bio), you're probably better off taking an in-depth review of the Campbell general biology textbook (an older edition of which I'm sure you could get cheaply and not feel bad marking up). Also, if inconsistent diagrams and lapses in text editing aren't really your cup of tea, this book might not be for you."
3,Better than Princeton Review but still not enough,"A bit better than the PR guide, at least the paper is of higher quality. More topics are covered in more details, but there are still things missing. And beware, some of the details in this book may not be correct. The best thing to prepare for your GRE biology is to use this book to determine what materials you need to know for the exam, and study the equivalent topics in your Campbell (or any intro. Biology textbook)"
1,Not a great book for gre biology,"I studied this book cover to cover and still didnt do well on the biology exam. In some sections, the information is detailed, but in most sections it is not. Unfortunately, there arent any better gre test prep items out there. I am going to study again, but I think I am going to go directly to a textbook and study from there. But dont buy, its a waste of time. Or if you do buy, use as a starter to your studying, but dont end with it."
2,Helpful but...,I brought this book to study for my Biology exit exam. I was helpful in certain areas but it is missing a lot of information in the subject of biology
2,Might as well not study at all,"I used this book when preparing for the subject test. Having taken the test, I feel like this book is almost as helpful as not studying at all. It's just kind of useless in terms of relevant information. I wouldn't recommend it. Find some other study material."
3,HERE ARE THE BLOODDY TRACKS - SHEESH!!!:,"1. Pop Radio Mix2. Hot Vocal Radio Mix3. Short Vocal Radio Mix4. Squeaky Clean Intro Mix5. Secret Party Mix6. Deb's Dark DubRemixes by Mike Rizzo, he employs a mix of rhythmic and catchy pop melodies backed with thumpin' house/dance beats. Has done remixes for BSB, O-Town, Tamia, Whitney Houston, Luther Vandross & Kylie Minogue. Oh, and Deborah Cox but there is more. I like Rizzo along with Mousse T and Maurice Joshua, there remixes are more on the pop and soul side of things opposed to the techno side."
3,"""Your Secret"" is somewhat dated, but not too bad...","Recently, I brought the single ""Your Secret"" and listening to the album/radio version of the tune I thought it was fairly decent. While listening to the song, it sounds similar to Jennifer Lopez's 1999 hit ""Waiting for Tonight."" The remixes on the single were decent, but the overall thing which plagued her 2001 album release ""M.Y.O.B"", which plagues this song is Gibson's vocals sounds too plain. Instead of Gibson giving a breathy delivery (which should have been used on this tune), she instead sings the song without too much emotion. Gibson before has proven she has the octave range, the lower vocal register, and can perform a breathy and sexy song, but instead does not do this here.Overall, the song is good and the remixes fair slightly better, but Gibson has performed better songs. Admittedly, the chorus is catchy and empowering but the song falls short of making this an excellent release."
2,"Turn back to roots, Rick","I vas very disappointed after I was listening to this record.Rick looses his fine sense for jazzy sound,and falled in a deep stupid commerce.I will wait for the next album anyway, but....turn back to your roots Rick!!"
1,Did not receive the correct book from company,"I ordered this book from cmuweb out of Minneapolis, MN. Too my surprise I didn't get it in the mail but a totally different book. The book I got was Lithuanian-English/English-Lithuanian Dictionary, with a totally different ISBN # and the picture on this site, it isn't even the same book. I wrote webbooks@umc.edu and I am hoping they will correct the error, so then I can really write a review the book I really ordered. I was really looking forward to start learning phrases, so I could practice on my Lithuanian friend. My shipping paper that came with the book said the correct book....but it sure wasn't the book when I was looking at it.....I was wondering what happened to the phrases????? Hope they correct this order. Thanks for reading."
4,Lithuanian-English/English-Lithuanian Dictionary,A handy dictionary and phrase book for a beginning student of the Lithuanian language.
1,Don't become a victim yourself,"I purchased the unrated version of this movie hoping that it would be a stellar softcore movie for a nice sensual evening. It was not stimulating in either the plot or the ""action"". Do not purchase either version of the movie, unless you want to be disappointed and bewildered at how a director could let such raw talent go to waste. This movie is a teaser without the required suspense and provocative eroticism that one would expect from reading the cover and other reviews. The only victim of desire here is the person who purchases the movie."
2,Doesn't really work well with our CD player,"The concept of this game is great and the kids (ages 2 and 4 when we first got it) loved to play it, except that you need to be able to easily select track numbers up to 60 on your CD player to make it work well, otherwise the order the sounds are presented in starts to be easy to remember and kids know which cards are likely to win. Granted, the box says ages 3 and up, but conceptually there is no reason a younger child couldn't play...we just had to remove the tiny chips and replace them with larger paper squares. Most of the sounds are done well, but there are a few that the adults finally know only after a few rounds of playing. Just didn't work with our (admittedly low) level of technology. It would have been better for us if they had each sound on a separate track and just let us randomize (despite repeats)"
4,turn-of-the-century,I liked this book pretty much. It tells a lot about Matty's baseball career and opens a window into the National League from 1900-15. It doesn't tell very much about Mathewson's personal life though. All in all its worth a read if you like baseball history and/or Christy Mathewson.
5,Love and Youth,"""Love and Youth' has a place in any cd collection, and Jenny Wilson in music .The second Single "" Let My Shoes Lead Me Forward"" off the album ""Love and Youth"" I bought to downloaded straight from Rabid Record's MP3 Shop, when went straight back an hour or so later and bought to downloaded the album. 48 hrs has passed and I am going to buy the cd, and its in my top 10 for this year and my top 50 for this decade."
4,Quality/cost,"With this rosin i have found it to be a huge step over that of the rosin that came with my violin. It sticks to the strings very well, and has good response. I have noticed a few times where the bow slid and skipped over the string not entirely sure if it was failure of the rosin to stick to bow or failure of the bow to keep the rosin but it seams to wear off rather fast. I will generally re-apply rosin every 45-60 minutes of casual practice. I am new to violins and have only been practicing for a very short amount of time so may be my fault. non the less I recommend this rosin for a person with a light/medium bow hand. if you are a person who seams to put more pressure on their bow then go with a lighter harder rosin. on that note this rosin started on the first pull no scratching needed ^.^ was very pleased I plan to use this stuff for a while"
2,Not that great,"This trimmer works only so-so. It never trimmed my hairs that closely in the nose or the ear.I have had it about 2 years and it won't even hold a charge at all, so I will have to throw it away.I would not recommend this trimmer to anyone."
1,Don't waste your time,The strange beard trimming guards are worthless and the nose hair trimmer has plastic blades that do a poor job. The trimmer blade is OK but not good on thick hair.
3,I agree...,"I agree with the other user... This unit works really well, Acu-Control really does work. However, the stand is not a charging stand, but a storage stand. The charging plug is on the bottom of the unit, you will have to lay it down flat while charging--not a very smart design if you ask me. The storage stand can't take the unit if it's plugged in. But everything else is great..."
2,Master of none!,"If you're just looking for a ear and nose hair trimmer, pass on this jack of all trade, master of none.The Panasonic ER411NC, which can be purchased at Amazon.com, does a much better job and costs less."
1,Okay while it worked...,"I bought this several months ago and have used it lightly - worked fine for what it was meant to do. However, when it ran out of the very first charge it would not charge up again and now I am stuck with a dead useless trimmer. Complete waste of money."
1,Bad Results: I had to start over on my beard!,"The guide for controlling length of trimming is inconsistent when you change the angle you are holding this unit. Basically, I came around my neck to my chin and when I did this, the cutting blade came REALLY close and left about a 3/4 inch path of almost no beard in the middle of my chin! There goes a month of growing a new beard! I'm starting my beard and my search for a trimmer over. I never had this problem with my old Wahl trimmer. Lesson learned: Spend more and get what you pay for!"
2,2nd best to.......,"i used this for a ~1yr, then the wall charger cracked. i replaced it with the ~ Phillips Norelco Bodygroom = AMAZING!!! it is much better at trimming, and cutting ~ANY~ hairs..... it's also water proof to use in the shower - go get that one instead of this.."
5,Slowing of the Earth's rotation,"I play this album alot. His playing is so powerful that it causes you to stop what you're doing and just listen. It's hard to ignore a masterpiece. You've heard the expression, ""stop and smell the roses."" Stevie's music demands you ""stop and listen to the guitar."""
3,Disappointingly Raw,"I'm a huge SRV fan and enjoy Stevie's early more pure blues work more then his later more rock influenced music (which is still great). I was excited that a live album from his early period was put out, but became disappointed after repeated listings. My disappointment stems more from the band then from Stevie. This is the Layton\Shannon Double strouble we have come to love as Double Trouble. This album features Jackie on base it is just no comparison. Steve could be Stevie because DT was so GOOD. To understand how great and tight Doubel Trouble is just listen to Texas Flood. This is for hard core SRV fans only. Better live albums can be found in Live at Carniage Hall and Live at Montreux are much much better."
3,By far not the best SRV ever did . . .,"Stevie Ray Vaughan is truly the master of texas style blues guitar, but this album only displays a small portion of his skill as a guitar player or as a musician as a whole. In the open, They call me guitar hurricane, and all your love I miss loving could be better; but the rest of the album is very good. I guess maybe I'm asking too much from a guitar god."
4,Good live album,"As it was mentioned in the summary this was recorded at ""The Steamboat"" on 6th street in Austin, Tx. I believe the show was originally broadcast live and yes they played more songs than what is on the cd. As an afterthought the KLBJ mobile truck decided to record the gig but unfortunately they ran out of tape. The rest of the set is lost unless someone recorded it straight to a cassette tape off the airwaves."
2,SOHW-1673 - poor DVD-R movie burning.,"I had a Lite-ON SOHW-1213s with great results, replaced it for the SOHW-1673s as an upgrade, but the results when backing up movies to DVD-R discs were very poor. Tried several brands of discs at various speeds (only RiData 4x -R media seemed to work fine), changed the unit 2 times (meaning I tried three units of the same model, even the third one had a different manufacture date), upgraded firmware and burning software, formatted the computer to start with a fresh windows and tried two different computers, etc. 5 out of 6 DVD players had skipping problems.DVD+R movies seem to work okay.If you intend to use this burner for data back up, it is an excellent choice, LITE-ON has a great line of products, but for backing up movies it-s definitely not recommended, unless you want to restrict your selection of media.I didn't test the dual layer functionality.I intend to get an LG player since my older model is no longer available."
5,Works great,"This is a good drive, My old drive ""bit the dust"" after almost 9 years of light use (death by age, not ailment :o). I am pleased."
2,Cat killer with excuses,"I did NOT like this book at all. Certainly it was interesting, and the abuse described was horrific. However, there seems to be something missing in the diagnosis here - this woman killed probably at least 50 cats, strangling them while they struggled wildly, and I'm supposed to feel empathy with her? I couldn't come up with anything but disgust for her. And so many times it seemed like she was proud of killing cats. I don't think she'd get the same diagnosis these days. ""Psychopath"" comes to mind. Ugh. Someone recommended this book to me is the only reason I bought it and read it. I wanted to stop reading it after the first cat killing, but thought MAYBE there was some redeeming value to the book. I think the person who recommended the book to me forgot the cat-killings were in there, because when I went to tell her I had bought the book, she was already telling me NOT to read it. Ha. Sorry I wasted the tiny bit of money on this traumatizing, nasty melodrama."
1,Trauma Up The Wazzoo!,"Ugh. I felt like I was traumatized by reading this book. Prism goes into heavy abuse details at the beginning, nearly fifty pages of it, which leave the reader thinking, ""Yeah, yeah, I get it, but when is the story going to start?"" It's all background for the first bit, and as terrible as it must have been to experience these things, the reality of it is watered down by the number of incidences that are presented one after another. After a while, you just don't care. Although multiple myself, I just could NOT get through this one."
1,Item is discontinued,I emailed McDougall's Right Foods and they stated that this item has been discontinued. There are no plans to bring this item back to production.Sorry to see it go.These products are really good for those of us who do not like to cook from scratch.
1,Very hard to follow,"I purchased this video after using Gin Miller's Step Reebok video (which was great). I was very dissapointed in the lack of user friendliness and the difficulty of the dance moves. I was unable to get through this workout even once (I felt like an uncoordinated clod). If you are looking for a workout you can absorb on the first one or two tries, forget about it. Petra Kolber does nothing to introduce you to the somewhat complicated dance moves. Stick with Gin Miller's Step workouts if you want good, fun and straight forward workouts."
1,I want to return my copy but I've already opened it!,"I purchased this video because I wanted an all aerobic video that I could follow along with. With this video she gives no instruction or a chance to learn the routine. There was too many different moves all in a row, it is almost impossible to follow along. My feet felt numb trying to repeat all the moves. I hate this work-out!"
1,Not for beginners!,"I purchased this tape, thinking it was by Reebok, and would probably be good. I take a step aerobics class (lo-impact) and wanted to do more at home. I was very disappointed. It's more like a dance aerobics video and you have to be very quick to follow the routines. They change too quickly for this out of shape gal! A good tape if you are advanced or like to dance. Absolute hell for us poor uncoordinated folk,"
4,"A strong, dance-oriented, medium-impact workout.","If you get frustrated with aerobics videos that have sloppy, uncoordinated moves that don't fit with the music or look downright silly, this is the workout for you. It uses real dance moves, like the mambo, the cha-cha, the grapevine, and even the twist, and adds them one at a time so you have time to catch up. I had no trouble keeping up even on my first time through.The workout is pretty low-impact, but there are options to increase the intensity if you wish. Very well paced - I never got out of breath or felt overwhelmed, but I definitely got a good workout by the end. Good warm up and cool down.The background is pretty new-agey, and the canned dialogue could be a lot more believable, but if you can ignore them, the workout is well presented."
5,Stands the Test of Time,"Despite amassing a considerable collection of exercise videos in the past 10 years, the Reebok Versa Training series (Hi-Low, Dance Step, Abs, Legs) is undoubtedly my favorite. Hi-Low and Dance Step have the quality of being filmed, rather than taped. The background is artistic: montage images on a large screen; billowing curtains off to the side, nearly out of sight. The music is of the ambient-world variety, as in the Buddha Bar or Hotel Etages compilations. With such high production values, exercising never becomes a monotonous grind. However, the learning curve is not instant. You will have to stop and rewind the tape, but it is worth the effort. The Abs and Legs tapes can be learned in one or two viewings. The trade-off is that they're less visually satisfying, but they are well done and provide quality work-outs."
1,No Good!,ACTUALLY IGNORE MY 1 STAR BECAUSE I WOULDNT GIVE THIS VIDEO ANY. THIS VIDEO IS DEFINETLY NOT FOR BEGINNERS SHE DOESNT EXPLAIN ANY MOVES TO YOU LIKE YOUR SUPPOSE TO KNOW WHATS COMING NEXT. AND IT DOESNT MATTER HOW MANY TIME YOU REWIND AND REWIND YOU STILL WONT CATCH ON. OH AND BABY THE MUSIC JUST GOTS TO GO!!!
4,"This is a Number 1 single in Europe, it is VERY popular!","This is Robbie Williams, he is gorgeous and very talented. I believe he was in the group 5, and that is what his song ""No Regrets"" is about. Try it out, you will probably like it"
4,Pretty nice,"I've bought a couple of shower heads from local Targets and stuff, but I decided to go big and get this one. I've had it for a full week now and am not disappointed. I removed the flow limiter(takes one minute and a pair of pliers), and this thing flat out sprays water. The only thing I haven't tested is how well it works with the flow limiter in place. Regardless, I'm sure if you have decent water pressure(over 2.5 gpm), then you'll be very satisfied with this baby. My only qualm is that I wish it had maybe one more setting between the medium and heavy pulse.Shipped fine, undamaged, and installs like a regular shower head, very simple."
4,Nice if you remove flow restrictor,"I first saw this showerhead in Four Seasons Hotel in NYC. I installed one at my home and the water pressure did not seem so great. After removing (unscrewing) the small black particle filter, I removed and discarded the white flow restrictor, then replaced the black particle filter. Aha! Great water pressure as expected."
4,Nice showerhead,"I love this shower head. I purchased it after using one in a Marriot Hotel (wentworth by the sea) in Newcastle NH. It does work a bit better if you have fairly strong water pressure, but is still good with moderate pressure. It was better at the hotel, because their water pressure was a bit stronger than the pressure I have at home."
4,"Great rack, might not fit a woman's bike.","The rack is attractive and very sturdy, but the arms were a couple inches too short to reach the braze-ons on my 15"" women's bike. I had to jury rig it to get it mounted and it's a bit slanted towards my seat post. Even with everything I did to it the rack still works like a charm and doesn't rattle or shake at all. On a men's bike it would be perfect, and even with the slant it's good enough that I'm going to hang on to it."
2,very average,I Really dig Sade but this disc doesn't hold a candle to her Early Work.The Music&vibe were Off Here.very average.The Arrangements&Production are better on her First two albums.still Sade is worth a Listen always but this is nowhere near the Best.
5,Smooth Sade,"Sade Adu, the Nigerian/British singer is in a league of her own. She wrote all her own lyrics for this album, and produced and arranged the songs. Love Deluxe (what a great title) is her fourth multiplatinum album. It contains lush, smooth, music that has provided much stress relief and relaxation for me. However, this CD also serves up a twinge of conscience and messages about social justice with the blood pressure-lowering sounds. Two of the tracks, ""Feel No Pain"" and ""Pearls"" are about poverty and injustice. I love ""Feel No Pain."" But ""Pearls is extremely depressing. The melody and words sound like a dirge. I skip it every time.My only complaint is that is is so short - only nine tracks. Plus, the last one, Mermaid, is an instrumental. So only eight songs with Sade's incomparable vocals."
5,COMPLETE AMAZEMENT,"THIS CD IS EXCELLENT,YOU SHOULD BUY IT. I listen to this CD almost everyday and it seems to capture so many different moods that it is always nice to listen to. The songs are all classics and Sade is truly an amazing artist. If you are not already in love with her, please peep- the cds are genius."
4,Amazing bass sound!,"This is one of the best mixed recordings I've ever heard. The bass and drums here sound amazingly crisp and fat. Don't care for one track, but the rest is wonderful. Recommended."
5,No Ordinary Love,"This is a sassy love song for the true romantic at heart. Miss ""True Dive In Diva"" really gives it up on this piece."
4,SADE !!!! SADE!!!! Need I say more??!!,"You know, sometimes you should stop trying to be so analitical ( and no I didn't spell it wrong ) and just sit back in a hot tub either by yourself or with someone you love, pop open a bottle of Asti and just listen and groove with the music...I s this the type of music you listen to while working out ( NO! ) driving to or from work ( again NO! ) to put it point blank, this is for me, music to soothe and pacify my soul and ride the mellow waves into relaxation. I feel sorry for those who would instead pick SADE apart like she is in a lab somewhere because if you let them, SADE can take you somewhere you want to be"
5,Refreshing,"Though I may not be huuge fan of CCM, 15-year-old Bethany Dillon has an overflow of God-given talent and passion which she directs not for her own glory, but the glory of Him. Her maturity amazes unceasingly. In a field of cliches and carbon copied artists, Bethany is truly a gem. This album sparkles, and her faith is clearly shown through her lyrics, lyrics that reflect her maturity both in life and in faith. The only lowlight would probably be the song ""All I Need,"" which lacks the depth of her other songs and even falls a little under the category of cliche. However, overall, Bethany Dillon's debut proves to be nothing short of splendid, and I recommend it completely."
2,Hmmm...,"I have her CD but I don't think I'll buy her next one. It just isn't music that grabs me.The good tracks:""Revolutionaries""""Beautiful""""Move Forward""The rest is so-so. She can sing, but her voice isn't the kind that is outstanding. I like a viarity of music styles but Bethany's doesn't attract my attention. There's too much guitar. I love Nichole Nordeman and she has lots of piano. Maybe it's becuase Bethany plays too much guitar, and I love piano and guitar isn't my fave instrument.But don't be discouraged listen to the clips and if you love them then get the album, as Amazon's service is quick and I think it's pretty good. It's a good price too."
2,Lives Only as Long as Its Batteries Do ...,"This is a great product for its primary purpose, but rather disappointing once one finds out that they cannot replace the batteries of their own accord. If you purchase one, do not expect more than two-to-four years of useful life before you have to discard it as a result of non-replaceable NiCad batteries."
2,Batteries quit after approx 1 1/2 years of once a month use!,The design and quality of the Norelco T990 was the very best trimmer I've ever had. I've had about five trimmers over a 20 year period that I only used to trim my heavy eye brows about once a month. The numbered settable head was much better than attachment combs on others. The blades were very perfectly sharp to the end. Could have been a great product except for the batteries. This was a $70.00 item and turned out to be very disappointing. I could have gotten the same use from a $10 battery powered trimmer of course having to spend approx 10-15 dollars on batteries over this year and a half period. Also the blade sharpness would not compare but it would have cut. Norelco made a mistake in batteries in this product.
2,Norelco's bad batteries,"Well, after 2 years the rechargeable batteries gave up. This is very disappointing considering the price, and the fact that you don't use it every day. I've had a similar problem with one of their shavers.I won't be buying Norelco products in the future."
2,"Nice Features, Poor Battery Life","I must concur with several other reviews here. This is a well designed item in every respect except one: after two years of twice a week use, the battery died and soon the unit stopped working even when plugged in, which is inexcusable for a trimmer at this price."
2,Battery dead after about 2 years,"It was a good trimmer while it lasted, but it stopped holding a charge and now won't even work while plugged in. I really didn't use it that much for it to stop working so soon."
2,It just wasn't what I expected,"After reading the many favorable reviews of this product, I decided to purchase it. However, while the trimmer works well on thinning my sideburns, the flat edge is sorely lacking. My main use for a trimmer is to edge my sideburns and occasionally thin them out. With this trimmer, the flat edge did not perform to my expectations. It didn't seem to even touch the hairs around my sideburns, and no matter how many times I ran the edge over my skin, nothing seemed to happen. This razor works well for people who want something to thin out their beards or sideburns, but the straight-edge is sub-par. If that doesn't matter to you, then this is a good trimmer. However, if you are like me and need a good straight-edge, then find another razor."
3,FOR NURSING STUDENTS,This book does help you understand patho a bit better. I do recommend this book as a good source. It doesn't get real deep but it is easy to read and understand.
3,Good for the price - needs a volume control,"I was very surprised at the noise canceling capability of these earphones. The big drawback is that there is no volume control on the earphones so you are dependent on the devices (or worse yet the airline seat control) for volume adjustment. My PDA/MP3 player's volume resolution is very poor so the sound is either too loud or too soft. However as strict noise canceling, at least in airplanes, they seem to work very well."
3,Decent sound but poor quality..,"I got these at staples with a rebate for a great price. The sound quality is ok for the price, but soon after the headphones began falling apart. first the cover to the battery compartment kept falling off until I put some scotch tape to hold it in place.Then one of the earpiece came apart because the pin holding them fell out. And this with light use I never took them out of my house. Now i have returned them to Targus hoping they will replace them. If you paid full price this is not a good deal since these headphones are poorly built."
2,Breaks easily,"I was happy with the noise canceling features, not the best but definitely works. Great for airplane rides - really helps cut out that background engine noise. My problem however with these headphones hwoever is the design - the first set i had brok near the earpiece hinge and was replaced by Targus (cheers to them). the second set broke too in a different place - the deisgn of these just isn't very sturdy. I'm gentle with my stuff too, so either I had bad luck w/two defective units or they're just not made well."
2,disappointing - poor design,"Shortly after I began using my head phones, I noticed the wiring at the hinges was starting to crack the wire coating. Within 8 months of not-very-heavy use, the left earpiece wouldn't work any more. Guess I can't send them back, since I didn't keep the box!Also, the battery pack is in an annoying place - every time I turn my head, it catches on something."
2,"Loved them, until they broke!!!","I absolutely sang the praises of these earphones. The noise cancellation on airplanes is amazing. I couldn't have been happier...untilLast 5 hour flight to Hawaii, I open them up and realize that the tiny pieces of plastic that hold them together to rotate, 3 out of the 4 pieces were broken. Only one was in my bag. So, two had previously broken off and gone by the wayside. I spent the whole ride having to search for this tiny piece of black plastic the size of a grain of rice every time it fell out.They have a year warranty and I have owned them for about a year and two months. You really let me down this time Targus."
2,"Performance ok, durability not good.","Have had these headphones for about 2 years, but used very rarely, maybe about 10-15 times total. Main issue is that these are big and take up too much space to put in my briefcase. Performance is ok, though sometimes there's a crackling sound just touching the control where you turn on/off noise canceling. Durability is a big problem...during my last trip, the cover over the ear cup foams literally went to pieces. I had to pick the pieces out of of my hair and clothing in the middle of the flight."
1,Breaks easily,"These headphones worked fine for a few days. The noise cancellation was OK, but not great. Then I knocked the headphones off my desk onto the carpeted floor and the left channel stopped working. If they hadn't proven so fragile, I'd have given them 3.5-4 stars, but if they break this easily, it's just a matter of time -- days, probably -- before they become useless. Buyer beware!"
2,Smaller than they look,"This item is made from nice stainless steel but it is sized for a very small person with a miniature frying pan. I am looking for a tool to hold onto an item and turn it over without dropping it. This thing has a VERY SHORT handle and it's dangerous to use near a fry pan. In fact, since it does no good as a salad server, I have yet to find a use for it. Don't get one or you'll be stuck like I am with another piece of useless junk in your kitchen.I know. I am going to put it in the garage sale bin... for a quarter. My loss. Bummer."
3,Tiny!,"This canister of Haba peas and carrots is tiny! I wasn't expecting it to be so small. I do like the peas and carrots, but for the price I paid I wish there were more of them."
5,Wonderful,"My almost four year old got these for Easter. Just adorable all around. He loves them. Beautiful Haba quality. Made in Germany. We've been making ""stew"" all weekend.This is not a toy for a young child and is not being sold for a young child. So yes, they are a choking hazard for my 2 year old like pretty much all of my son's toys. If you have younger children and can't closely supervise their play, the Haba pineapple is a great toy. Very fun to take out and refill the can."
2,Ridiculously small for the price,I also bought play food from Melissa and Doug which were more appropriate for play kitchen than the dented can of peas and carrots from Haba.
3,Fire starters are small,They strike and burn well but only about five minutes so have plenty of gathered kindling on hand. Probablly better for backpackers than RV campers. Measure about 3/8' by 1/2' by 2'. Good value for 5 bucks though.
4,How She Knows What She Knows about Yo-Yos,"This book was enjoyable. I was able to relate to the stories, characters, and places. This book is a fast read for anyone who enjoys good literature."
4,Former FBI man speaks about corruption,"Smoots isn't the greatest writer I've ever read, but the story is so important that it should find it's way to everyone's bookcase. Most people believe that only kooks believe in a government within a government, but here is a former FBI agent that found exactly that.Some will remember the IPR - China scandle that brought communism into China right after WWII. Those that don't will be educated on it. Those that do remember, we be taken down into the motives and reasons behind the actions of the IPR and the men that backed them."
5,Government that you don't see.,"An excellent book. It will surprise you, and not pleasantly either. Read the book and you will understand why we are in big trouble."
1,Great Shave but battery/electronics technology is worthless,"I thought I was seeing things when I read the Feb. 11 review of this shaver. I had EXACTLY the same problem. The shaver provided an excellent shave, but died in the middle of my second shave. I called Norelco, they were very accommodating and immediately sent me a replacement. I charged the new one, as I did the original, exactly as the directions suggested. The second shaver lasted about 5 shaves before it too died. I could not even get it to go on when plugged in. After several hours I tried it again when it was plugged in, and it did work. At that point I had totally run out of patience, after spending so much money on a shaver. I sent it back to Norelco for a complete refund and am currently waiting to hear from them. This is really too bad, because I have been strictly using Norelco shavers for over 35 years and have been totally satisfied up until this point."
1,Defective Battery,"Like many many others I bought ""top of the line"" only to be confronted with a defective machine...same symptoms, battery discharges early and can't be satiisfactorily recharged. I would think with all the reviews Norelco (Phillips) would get on this problem quickly. Word of mouth is going to damage their sales mightely.I'm sending mine back, hoping that by this time they'll have fixed the problem. I'll let you know. Meanwhile I wont shave.Added 9 June 2006:Norelco finally fixed the problem (a bad transistor) and now it works flawlessly. I get 100 shaves on each charging. CHANGE MY RATING TO 5 STARS now"
1,too smart for its own good,"I've gone through 2 of these shavers and final gave up and requested a full refund from Norelco. Their engineering department still has a few more kinks to work out with this product. The product is entirely ""smart"". The on-off switch is a ""soft"" switch. The ""smarts"" in the unit watch the switch and turn the unit on or off depending on how you control the switch. The problem is the unit is sometimes not too smart and ignores the switch. I have a unit that just turns itself off while having a full charge. The second unit was just the opposite and wouldn't turn off. Good ideas Norelco. Bad execution. I'll like for a unit with a real on-off switch."
3,Not a great shave,"I have a heavy & hard to shave beard and this shaver does not cut it (pun intended) when compared to my (new) Remington MS3-3700 foil shaver. Although the shave was adequate, I had to go over and over and over the same spots to get it where I wanted it, and no amount over ""going over"" would give me a smoothly shaved chin, mustache or neck area. Another issue with all Norelcos is that monthly or so you're supposed to take the heads out and clean them individually, taking care not to mix the rotors with the wrong screen. I'm just not the type of person who will do this regularly. Foil shavers are much easier to clean because you just pop the foil out and either brush, blow or rinse, depending on the particular model)"
3,Not for Neatniks,"This is my fifth electric shaver and my third Norelco. The closeness is about the same as the 965RX Rotatract which I purchased in '96. There is one noticeable difference, however. This razor drops stubble as you shave. A good deal of it. Unlike my last two Norelcos, this one has the pivoting heads. As a result of the design, the hair pocket which catches the stubble isn't completely closed, and the stubble is free to fall out. The problem is probably common to all the Norelcos with the pivoting heads. But for the price, you'd think they'd have found a solution."
3,Save your money,"I attended a focus group for this razor prior to production and was incredibly excited when it hit the market. I bought it thinking it would be the best razor ever. I was wrong. I don't get a close shave. It takes more time to shave with this razor than my other razor. I do like the pivoting heads though. I am used to an 11,000 rpm shaver and when I switched to this I thought there was something wrong with it. It is very slow and almost seems to be struggling to work.Sorry folks, not a fan. If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't."
5,Outstanding,"Having used various Norelco shavers over the past 20 years, this is by far Norelco's best effort to date. Comfortable, quiet, and best of all 100 minutes of shave time. Thus, eliminating the need for constant recharges. Although pricey, it is money well spent. I've gotten the best shave from this model, no irritation and my face was smooth as a babys skin."
3,better than other electric shavers,"Although this electric shaver is relatively better than other electric ones, it still lags behind the manual ones. In particular, I am not quite satisfied with the job it does with my neck and sideburns. You should also note that all 8000 series includes the same shaver but with different displays and battery times."
1,It fell apart!!!!!,"I have used Norelco products for 30 years. I bought the 8894XL primarily for its long battery life (I travel internationally for weeks at a time). On one hand, this gave the best shave ever. BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND. . . . . After less than three weeks of use, it fell apart. Literally. The head assembly fell out of the body and could not be put back together. Of course, I was in Asia with more than a week left on my trip. So I bought another 8894XL at the duty-free store; it was much more expensive than from Amazon, but maybe the Philipshave version will last longer. Upon my return, I called Norelco customer service; but that is another story. . . Clearly, from my experience (and the experiences of others who have written reviews), Norelco has major quality control issues. For a shaver that lists for 320USD, this is ridiculous. And their customer relations are equally problematic."
2,Sorry not a 5 star rating :(,"I wish I could rate your product a 5 star. It seems every single year I have to buy my husband a new shaver. First it was Remington, but now the last few years I have been buying Norelco for him. He does well with them at first then....I have even purchased the replacement heads. I do not know why he is so hard on them."
1,Battery problem....,"I received this as a Christmas gift in December 2003. It worked flawlessly every day until last week. The battery just died and it would not even work when plugged in. After recharging, it works for less than 1 minute then goes dead again. After checking Amazon for reviews I'm shocked to see that so many people have had the same problem. I've always loved Norelco shavers and have used them for about 28 years and have never, ever had even a slight problem with them. When I first started using this model I thought I wasn't going to like it at all because it was shaving much worse than my previous model. To my amazement, after the approximate ""two week"" break in period it started shaving even closer than my previous model. If it weren't for the battery I would have given this 5 stars. Called customer service (800-243-3050) and they're sending a prepaid envelope for an exchange. Some people have said their replacement did the same thing. I'll keep my fingers crossed..."
2,"Not the exact same, But the same system.","I have a Norelco Spectra 8880 XL that I have had for almost one year. While it is not the exact same razor, it is still based on the Spectra 7 shaving system. Initially I was very pleased with the razor, but the performance seems to have dropped off. When it was new, a shave only took a few minutes and boy was it smooth! Now the facial area is still done great and in little time, my neck is lack luster to say the least. It misses patches and to go back over them takes a lot of time to only possibly shave it. Regardless if it shaves it or not, I get irritation. Changing the sensitivity setting doesn't help, it only seems to make it miss more patches. This is my third Norelco through the years, and I think I am going to try a Braun Activator or maybe a Panasonic."
2,Norelco should look up the meaning of quality control,"Shaves nicely, but I too was affected by the poor quality control at Norelco. Defective battery. I must admit though, when I contacted Norelco they offered to send me a pre-paid package and to ship them the defective item and they would ship me a new item right away. Not bad, most companies leave the shipping charge on the customer. And the CS guy didn't judge my ""charging abilities.""Oh well, hope the new one does better."
2,Bad Battery,"I received my 8894 XL ""James Bond"" shaver as a Christmas gift. I follwed the charging directions,(letting it charge several hours beyond the full display) I was able to shave for 3 days. I again followed the instructions,but this time the razor discharged to 0 in about 2 seconds. Norelco on line assistance informed me that there is a recall for this razor, and that I have to send it in for a replacement. So much for quality control."
1,Norelco 8894XL RECALL,"I just got off a live chat session with Norelco. I, too, experienced the battery problem many of you witnessed (a full charge only lasts a few minutes until the battery is depleted), AND THIS IS THE SECOND 8894XL THAT HAS EXPERIENCED THIS ANOMALY!). It turns out that there was a manufacturing defect (an identified defect in the printed cicuit board of the charging circuit) that has caused this problem!! Call Norelco Customer Care at 1-800-243-3050 and ask to have the defective unit replaced, as I just have done!"
2,"Initially impressed, then disappointed","I was initially impressed with this shaver. The shave was very comfortable and close. And it rinsed clean! Or so I thought. I dilgently rinsed the shaver under the faucet after every shave. However, after a few weeks, it needed hand cleaning. I opened the shaver, and cleaned the the heads. The design of the shaver heads made it virtually impossible to replace them properly. I finally got the heads in correctly, or so I thought! The shaver never operated correctly after that. I struggled for quite a while and could never get it right. I finally gave up and returned it to Norelco. Hopefully, my refund will be processed soon. I purchased the Remington as a replacement. Its shave is not as comfortable, but it is adequate, and it has its own cleaning system which doesn't require hand cleaning."
2,"Good, but not quite as close as my 4yr old Braun foil shaver","Ok, it's a nice razor and does shave close. But no closer (in fact a little less close ) than a Braun foil razor I've had for 4 years, which I bought reconditioned.Caveat: I use the electric razor to shave my head. When I did half my head with the Norelco and 1/2 with the Braun, the Braun was closer-even if barely. The Norelco was on it's closest setting, too. Also, the Norelco's blades were brand new, and my Braun's were about 6 months old! This was most noticeable at the end of the day, when the Braun stubble was a little shorter. Also, when I used the Norelco on my face and the back of my neck, it gave me razor burn like I have never experinced with a foil razor.As another reviewer here said, change your foil and blades (for me about once every year or so) and that's the real key to good performance. Finally, it just makes sense to me that the thinner the metal between the balde and your face, the closer the shave. Foil wins!"
1,World's most expensive disposable razor,"This shaver provides an excelent shave, but appears to last less then one week. My first one died half way through my second shave. Norelco customer service very pleasantly replaced it in about a week. The second one lasted all of five shaves before dying. This is obviously a well known problem at Norelco and they should have pulled this junk off the market before now. Mine is going back for a refund."
5,The best Norelco shaver and a little movie hype to boot,"I love that I can wash it out with WATER!!! No more searching for that little brush thingy and getting hair dust everywhere. It's discounted everywhere. The 5 battery lights sold me and really really help me know when to charge, which was not part of my cheaper Norelco's. I've had it 2 or 3 months now and I don't really notice a difference in the shave from the other Norelco models. If you use Norelco, you already have the best system on the market. When I got mine at Wal*Mart, I was just looking for another Norelco to replace the one I'd lost. I didn't care much about Bond movie hype. Did he even shave in the movie with it? I flipped the channel to watch something else on the airplane."
2,Not good on neck...,"Unlike other users I don't have any problem with its battery, even after more than four years it is still strong and gives 100 min of shaving time on a single charge. 8894XL is very quiet and charges in less than an hour.In my opinion Personal comfort control selector dial, which adjusts the stiffness of the floating heads is purely a gimmick. No matter what setting I use I get irritation on my neck. It is is also difficult to shave around sideburns but that is true for most rotary electric shavers. Pop-up trimmer is coarse and does not give a clean appearance. It performs very well on face I wish I could say same about the neck. The only work around for neck irritation is to use few gentle strokes of MACH3 razor."
4,Great Shave!,"I've been using this razor for years, since it came out. (2004???) So about 5 years and still going strong.I've used cheap ($50) electric razors before and they are pathetic compared to this. It's pretty darn close to a real razor in places, if you work it. Charge life is seriously amazing. I can go well over a month, maybe even 2, before having to charge this thing from using 6 times a week. The closeness dial is useful when you have extra long stubble or sensitive areas. Other than that I leave it at 0 (closest).The display counts down the remaining charge and is pretty accurate. It tells you when it needs cleaned out under the faucet, great.The heads have lasted until now (5 years) and I got a warning on the display telling me to replace the heads.The only negative is the flip out trimmer. It only has resistance in one direction (due to the flip nature) so you can only stroke in one direction. I have a separate trimmer I use instead, but this works in a pinch."
1,design flow?,"I bought this model for my husband, and I wish I didn't. He had problems with it, such as it would shut down before the battery was depleted when it was still showing between 50 and 70 min on a display. He had it replaced, and the second unit had the same problem. He sent it back for a refund and sad that Norelco/Philips just lost a customer as he lost his patience with this shaver."
4,"Great looking smooth shave, less irritation,but a bit pricey","I must admit that this is my first try at electronic shavers. I can't compare it with micro-film shavers, since I have never used one. It gives a dry, smooth shave, with very less irritation. I am still getting used to make it work well for all my facial contours. It has a nice adjustment to reduce skin irritation. I gave 4 stars, coz I am not really happy with the sideburn trimmer, and feel a little pricey for what you get."
5,Worth to buy !,"After I was doing my research for the best eletric shaver to be a Christmas gift for my husband, who's complaining a lot with his old one didn't work well !!!!(He had tried many before..) It was very hard to say which one is the best but as I read the customer reviews from many websites. I decided to get this one from amazon. I was afraid that he's not happy with it because he's so picky about things.. Well guess what ? !! He loves the way it works. He thanks me a thousand times and said this is the best shaver he ever had. It save his time shaving like 10 times ever !!! He said the result after shave it almost feels like shave with the normal razor shaver.(Very close result) I'm sorry that I couldn't describe why it's good. But if my husband say something's good. I know he's really mean it !!! And I always looks for the best thing for him. Thank you NOrelco James bond !!!"
2,Excellent shave but aolt of clean-up,"I purchased the Norelco 8894XL approximately 3 months ago. I love the electric shave that I get from this razor. There is ONE SERIOUS design flaw with this razor though. The shaved stubble (that is supposed to be trapped inside the head) comes out everywhere. My wife makes me use the razor outside, so that I don't get the shavings everywhere. It is very messy and I contacted the Norelco division (of Philips) and inquired about this. They told me that they have heard of this problem but would send me out a new head (just the blade holder portion). This did not solve the problem. I clean the razor after every use, in order to cut down on the mess, but has come to the point that I will have to try an electric foil razor."
5,Shaves very close.,"No electric shaver is going to get as close as a manual razor. But this one impressed me a lot. It got very close. I couldn't even feel any stubble, which most electric shavers leave. Does it provide as close a shave as a $7 razor? No. But it's not far off. And it's much more convenient.I didn't have any problems with the battery. In fact, I was very impressed by it. I'm not very hairy, so I only use 1-2 minutes at a time. I let the battery drain, and then charged it fully. I then used it for about over a year without charging it once. Amazing. Granted, I only shave about 3-5 times a week, and each time for only about a minute or two, but still, that's very impressive. Even when the indicator said ""0"" and advised me to recharge it, I didn't. I was still able to get a few more months of shaving at ""0 minutes left.""My dad needed a shaver, and since I prefer manual razors I gave this to him. Hopefully he's getting as much use out of it as I did."
2,Not Impressed,"I bought this shaver based on good reviews, but after 6 months I still have to use a blade to shave my neck and to get close to my sideburns, so this shaver is basically useless to me. It also leaves my neck red and raw feeling. I have not had any problems with it, but I'm going to sell it and try another brand. It works a little better when fully charged."
1,Be aware - 2nd unit with battery problem,"Very good shaver... for a few shaves. I bought my first unit on Christmas, had it replaced due to the battery problems similar to the ones reported in other reviews here. Second unit - same problem. My idea of a good shaver (and good product in general) doesn't include dealing with the customer service, and I've had too much of it with this shaver. I was offered a third unit - c'mon...I went for a refund, these guys need to admit that there is a design flow with these units and fix it rather than keep replacing the units. I have one word for them - recall"
2,KNOWN MANUFACTURING DEFECT,"April 10, 2004:I've now used the replacement unit for a few weeks, burning through a 103 minute full charge. The unit works well and apparently does not have the defective circuit.It appears to me that Norelco discovered the manufacturing defect, but could not distinguish between defective and non-defective units. Rather than recall all of the units, Norelco apparently decided to let its customers identify and return the defective units. Given the number of negative reviews on this site, the percentage of defective units must be quite high.March 8, 2004:I have had EXACTLY the same experience as the others who have posted reviews citing the defective circuitry. I'm now trying the replacement unit. So far, it works . . . ."
4,Excellent for an Electric Shaver,"I used a Braun shaver for about 10 years, but found that I had to shave at least once a week with a blade razor to prevent ingrown hairs. I have been using the Norelco 8894XL for about a week and so far no problems or temptation to shave with a blade. The shave is reasonably close, but compares with how my beard would be about 2-3 hours after shaving with a blade razor. The thing is cleaned with water - very convenient compared to my old Braun....I am not sure about the ""James Bond"" part - so far no babes or fast cars and my martinis tend to be stirred.Added after a couple of months use: I have now had the razor for a couple of months. Still excellent. The ability to wash the razor out with water is a huge plus when it comes to cleaning. A single charge lasts for over an hour's worth of shaving - this is about 40-50 shaves for me. The indicator shows 100 minutes at full charge, but I haven't gone to zero yet."
5,WOW! What a Shaver,"A few years ago I bought a Norelco 985RX which at the time was the best among my Braun and Remington shavers. I did not think Norelco could top that shaver. What a surprise. The 8894XL shaves at least twice as fast, and much closer. It is very quiet and I had to charge it once after a week's use. I did not have to go through an adjustment period. It did a great job from the first time. I really like the close quiet shaves and am sure it will provide years of service like my other Norelco. Great design!"
3,"Good for some, perhaps, but not for ME","Looks cool -- but that's not what I bought it for. Not a close shave at all, even after using it for a month. Even older, lower Norelco models shave better. Battery life is tremendous -- but who needs 100 minutes worth of shaving without charging? The only difference between sensitivity levels is how much it hurts -- takes the same amount of time, no closer shave. Washes well, but built in sensor is useless. My next shaver will be the Panasonic ES8092NC. Will try out and post after a month or so. Bon voyage."
3,great razor but not worth the cost,"Well made, comfortable to use and shaves well. So do lesser Norelco models however. Spend half as much and get all the performance."
2,Battery Problems are widespread,"Battery discharges completely before first shave completed. However the shaving heads did feel nice for that brief time. Blue wall plug in chargers is an odd choice, it doesn't appear to match the shaver. Also it was slight difficult to insert into shaver. Should have ability to recharge in stand but doesn't. Leather carry bag is a nice touch."
4,Trimmer no good,"I have a minor complaint: the pop-up trimmer doesn't shave for diddly squat. So I keep a 25 razor to edge my sideburns. Else, I am very happy."
2,"Not as good as Panasonic, or even Braun","I've owned and a Braun Syncro and Norelco Spectra, each for six months. The Panasonic Pro-Curve ES8092NC is better than both. Closer, faster shave. (I shave dry) Good trimmer. Smaller ""footprint"" than the Braun. Relatively easy to clean, especially when compared with the Norelco. Overall rank: Panasonic is No.1. Braun is No.2. Norelco is No.3. By the way, Norelco has problems with their ""money-back"" procedure. Don't count on getting your refund.Sure, it has to be recharged more often, but that's a problem only if you are going on a hike in the woods. (Why would you want to shave there?) The recharger stand is very compact and portable. Just leave it on the stand and it will always be charged."
5,No Problems,"Having read about possible battery problems, I hesitated before buying this model, but finally bit the bullet and went for it. No problems. After initially charging the battery, I started using the shaver on May 8. It didn't require a recharge until June 4. I recharged it again on June 27. (On the initial charge and the first recharge, I let it run down completely before charging. I recharged it for the second time when the indicator showed zero.) Since then, I've used it for 2 days with no signs of trouble.The shave is not only adequate for my dark brown hair, it's comfortably closer than I could manage with my old Norelco. There's no visible stubble at the end of the day."
1,Died the second day - Mr. Bond!,"Not much to add to the title. Bad! I see that some other people had the same problem with it. I know two days is not much, and that I am supposed to wait to two weeks for conclusions (what is the hair `brain' science behind this anyway?). However, it worked poorly for me from the beginning. Hmmm ... good looks, just like James Bond ...On the contrary, the wet/dry Panasonic ES8092NC worked well from the beginning for a very close shave. Better than the Mach 3 - with no surprise cuts. Please check my review there. I also tested the Braun the Braun 7680, but the Panasonic was an overall winner for me. The Braun is too involved with the cleaning thing, plus $ for supplies. The Panasonic is simple to clean - water and soap."
3,Quality Control Problem (bad battery),I had the same problems as with other people. I can only use the shaver for about 35 minutes before it discharge. I charged it to 100 minutes but when I get down to about 65-70 minutes it would just shut down and I have to recharge from 0 minutes again. I am exchanging it for a new one. Hope I get a good one now.
2,Should be better for the Price,"I recently purchased the Norelco 8894XL and had to return it the same day because the sideburn trimmer snagged and ripped out hair, instead of cutting it. The razor itself was okay, but was not nearly as smooth as I expected for the price. I had upgraded from something about $100 less and I noticed no positive difference."
3,Beats my Face UP,"I got this shaver NEW. It pulls at my hairs. It caused me to break out...ingrown hairs. I'm a lean guy, and it doesn't get my throat area that well. I do have very sensitive skin, so dragging a piece of metal all over it again and again during the SAME shave really beats up my skin. I'm gettin' rid of it. Back to hand shaving. SH*T!Brent J."
2,"Great Shaver, but go for the Braun","Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent shaver. I just cant justify spending [item price] for the same shave I can get with $100. I chose the Braun 7526 with the Clean and Charge base. The shaver is excellent, and the cleaner works excellently. If you are one of those guys who hafta have the latest and greatest, go for this. If not, get the Braun."
3,This shaver has really bad rezor heads.,Before buying this shaver please prepare yourself to have a trouble with razor heads (HQ8). You'll need to exchange them every 40-60 days.
4,Very Refined,"This is probably the most refined of any Norelco I've tried and I've owned a few. This is probably my second favorite. I have to agree with a previous poster that the ""Reflex Action"" models give me a much faster and closer shave. On the plus side, this thing has unbelieveable charge times (lasts a LONG time between charges) and the quiestest motor yet.I really have liked it for the year I've been using it. But. After all this time I felt compelled to come back here and report my experiences. In all honesty, I just recently got my old Reflex Action model back from my Brother and now I'm using that again. While it's not as refined, it is much faster and cuts my beard closer. If the Reflex Action weren't available then I'd go for this one."
4,Gothic Metal for fans of Crematory and Darkseed,"This album was a team effort between the original guitarist of Crematory and the singer from Darkseed. It reminds me a bit of a continuation of Crematory's Awake, which was the last album to feature the guitarist. To my knowledge the two no longer enjoyed working with each other and the band folded soon after."
2,overpriced,bad price its half the cost to buy each season separate these bundles are supposed to be cheaper deals not much more expensive
4,So far so good...,I started using this product one month ago. I know it will take 6 - 12 months to know for sure if it is working so it is probably a bit premature to rate it already. So far so good though...some of my disgusting thick nails are starting to peel back and I am seeing a very small amount of healthy nail growing at the base. You should note that the fine print of this product packaging says that it does not work on nails...I think some of the ads are a bit misleading. Only time will tell if it works or not.
3,worked ok,"it worked ok, but healing took a while, we had to switch to another stronger product, but i will still buy whenever the stronger product runs out."
4,for the musical,This book gives a decent selection of common and not so common lullabies - so if you are looking to expand your repetoir - this book is for you. If you can't read music or play an intrument - a quick search on youtube will provide you with examples of the lullaby in question to help you sing it your self. The art work is nice. Most songs only have one verse - I would have liked the other verses as well.
5,Good if,"Good if you would like to play lullabies, and the pictures are super. I like the tape of Golden Slumbers in the book section but its really songs, and better ones then are on Lullabies."
5,It is a travesty that this score did not win an Oscar!,"Here is another slap in the face of director Spike Lee. Terence Blanchard's score was truly worthy of an Academy Award, as were the film and acting performances of Denzel Washington, Angela Bassett, and Al Freeman, Jr.The score runs the gamut of old school jazz and swing to poignant melodic elegies detailing the turbulent times of the civil rights leader and his life. Every track vividly expresses the on-screen action, reveling in the expertise of the composer and the gifted storytelling of the director.A marvelous complement to the movie and the man is this score."
1,Going to the well once too often,"This was simply a very very bad idea. Opportunistic producers tried to milk as much cash as they could out of a trend-setting sound, and ended up largely killing the trend. The Bulgarian choir is very good at what they do, but someone should have known better than try this wretched cross-over album. The results were ghastly and unfortunate."
2,"The worst ""Mystere"" album i heard","On this CD the Bulgarian state radio choir tries to brake the pop charts with ""popular"" music mixed with their great ethnic bulgarian songs. The mixture is strange sounding and just 1 song is worth listening to. Better buy a normal ""Le Mystere"" album. END"
5,One of the Best Haba Foods,"I'm not quite sure why the site refers to these as biscuits, since it is a mix of cookies *and* chocolates (2 white chocolate ""kisses"" 2 dark chocolate ""kisses""), but they are nonetheless one of the sweetest, most detailed of the miniature Haba wooden play foods. Their textures and details really are delightful.As other reviewers have noted, they are extremely small: think a little larger than your fingertip per piece (maybe in the 3/4"" range), and could absolutely be a choking hazard. Definitely toy that would require some supervision under the age of 5 or 6, in my opinion.This set includes a total of 12 pieces, and a darling tin for storage. My daughter absolutely loves them and has not tired of them in the past year's worth of play they've seen, and really that says it all. Highly recommended."
4,Great except for the size,"These are well-crafted and realistic, but definitely small. I personally have no idea why Haba didn't make them about twice the size. Other than that they're a great addition to a kid's kitchen and I don't regret buying them, especially at a good price."
2,Not what I expected,This product is extremely small. its even too small for my 20mth old niece who loves having tea time with daddy. Not worth the money I paid. I dont suggest this item to anyone who is buying this for a toddler or older.
2,shocked by how small these were,"I should probably have read the description a bit more careful, however it said for 3 and up so I assumed it would be fine. These are extremely small, were talking the size of maybe a nickel. They are cute dont get me wrong but not what I was expecting. I also would not say these are biscuits, maybe cookies would have been a better description."
2,Tiny!,"Purchased this cookie box for our 2 y old daughter, to go with her tea set. Once it arrived, we had to send it back.It's soooo tiny, it's more suitable for a doll house."
3,Very tiny!,These tiny treats are VERY small! I bought them for use with a tea party set and they are really too small for the age of children that would play this way.
3,Tiny Treats,I was shocked how little the box was. I was looking for this among other items orderedand it was so small to be unnoticed in the carton. These tiny treats ARE the right size to fit on toy dishes though. You have to watch if you have younger children in the house and keep track of your investment. My niece likes them.
5,Great tea party toy!,"My two-and-a half year old just got these for Christmas, and loves them. Yes, they are small, but she easily recognizes them as ""pretend"" and only uses them when we have tea parties together. She also has the wooden tea bags from Haba. I love that the cookies come in different colors, shapes and designs so she can also have fun matching them up. They are just the perfect size for play dishes."
3,Reveals both sides more than the author knows,"I'm a divorce lawyer and bought this for the client perspective. The book is well-written and fairly interesting, although it drags at points. The author didn't realize how much of what Michael Nieland went through in the latter part of the book was his own fault. He would decide not to speak up in many instances, hoping for the best, and then getting angry and go looking for ""justice"" too late. He also refused insights into himself that would've been helpful for his case, although this is probably 20/20 hindsight. Michael Nieland also did his younger daughter several disservices, some quite bad. IMHO, this book is as much about Michael getting sucked into the game as it is about the serious downside of the family courts. And if he can sucked in, so can anyone. Altogether a good book."
2,If you are a Linda Howard fan don't buy this one!,"Wow this was almost painful to listen to. When Sara is abandoned by her globe trotting husband just after she delivers a stillborn child alone you feel sorry for her. But, she takes the opportunity to change herself and in fact finds that she likes to report herself. She remakes herself as Sally Jerome and becomes a top notch international reporter. But, when her magazine is bought by her ex husband she can't seem to function any longer.This book becomes a huge dissapointment at this point and painful to finish. She is no longer a funny strong character. In fact she lets herself be bullied by the ex and even ""gets back together"" with him while he still has a girlfriend. Yuck. Find one of her newer books and you will be a lot better off!"
1,"Bad, bad, bad. Don't waste your money on this one.","I was sadly disappointed. I didn't realise this was a reprint or I wouldn't have bought, let alone tried to read this. I trashed the book about one quarter of the way through. The two protaganists are pretty unbelievable. Linda Howard has written some pretty nifty stuff, and when you read some of her earlier books you have to wonder if this is the same author. Save your money."
1,Ughhhh!,"I share the same opinions as many of the other 1 star reviewers. This book is horrible. I literally wanted to kick the ""hero""(I use this term loosely) where it hurts. And the ""heroine"" is sooo annoying, words fail me. I love LH books, but this one ranks right up there with All That Glitters, another early LH book with an a-hole hero and a wimpy heroine.I will not buy any more re-releases of LH's earlier novels and I recommend that others do the same."
2,This would've been a great book--IF ONLY...,"Overall, we can see that LH's successful writing style is emerging. If only Rhy's character was injected with a VERY LARGE DOSE OF SENSITIVITY, this would've been a success! because all of his resulting thoughts & actions would've been tempered by that sensitivity. AND, he wouldn't have said THOSE inflammatory words that really made me see red!"
1,I LOVE LINDA HOWARD---THIS BOOK S****,I agree with the reader from Denver that this book is not one of Ms.Howard's better works. I have all of her recent titles and love everyone of them enough to have read them 2 and 3 times each. The characters in this story made me wish I could reach in and slap some sense into them. Shame on the publisher for re-issuing a 17 year old book without updating it to the 90's. I can promise that I will think very hard before I spend my hard earned money on any more books from this publisher.
1,Reprint of an early Linda Howard -- I liked this the least.,"Both attitudes and atmosphere are dated (early '7os). Behavior of the characters is silly and not believable--she believes every word his ex-girlfriend says without asking him about it; he searches for months to find her after she runs away, but never thinks to look at the house he knows she owns. Nonsensical how the woman gives up her life and career for ""her man"", and he makes no sacrifices for her -- his love should be enough. Give me a break! I love almost all of Linda Howard's stories, except these early ones."
1,Not so independent,"This was one of the worst romance books I ever read and I'm surprised that it was one of Linda Howard's. Give me a break! Sallie is anything but independent. She gives into everything that Rhy wants. She puts up a weak struggle and is even willing to go back to him despite everything he has done to her. There's hardly any emotion about the loss of her son.I can't stand Rhy. He's an overbearing, egotistical jerk. He leaves her for 7 yrs expecting Sallie to come back first. And then he plays games with her, takes away her job, and steals her novel. I would have kicked his [rear]. Sallie is anything but independent and Rhy is nothing but a caveman."
1,At the risk of sounding redundant...,"I hope that someone who's never read Linda Howard picks up this book and judges her writing talents by the tired and offensive tale held between these covers. I have read quite a few Linda Howard books and while some are definitely better than others, this one seems like she was phoning it in - and on a very bad connection. YIKES. Please, if you are thinking of purchasing this book and have never read Ms. Howard's work, check out ""Kill and Tell"" or ""Dream Man"" instead... You'll save yourself a couple hours of disappointment and distaste."
2,Not Howard at her best.,"Yuck, this is one of Howard's worse novels. Linda Howard is a great author, I have read most of her novels but her earlier ones just don't deserve any attention. In An Independent Wife, we meet two characters that are just too stupid to live. After meeting the hero, I thought he seriously was going to commit murder, too abusive for my taste. As for the heroine, she was wimpy and gullible, whatever happened to ""independent""? The plot was hard to believe, seperated for 7 years and still married? Howard has true talent but I only saw a glimmer of it in An Independent Wife. If this novel was or is your first Linda Howard, read a few of her recent ones, they are guaranteed great reads."
5,"Early works by linda howard, independant wife",This is in the beginning of a fine authors career. Even at this time she had the gift of a great story line and strong characters. I found this book very entertaining and have it in my collection. I find Linda Howard to have a gift of never repeating herself. Not in phrase or story line. Her works are always original and I can't wait for the next one to arrive on the shelves. Those of you who may have just started to read this author would enjoy finding the earlier books and reading them.
2,I am an avid Linda Howard fan.,"I wish that Miss Howard would follow up the MacKenzie's saga, with a story about Chance. It has been far to long since we have had a new book from her."
2,Independent Schmindependent,"Linda Howard is one of my favorite authors, so I bought this book in spite of the bad reviews. While an interesting comment on what was selling in the romance genre in the early 1980's, this book screamed the message JEALOUSY IS NOT LOVE (without meaning to, I'm sure).The fact that the hero is controlling, jealous and manipulative, and the fact that the heroine thinks this was normal and loving, illustrate the need for intense therapy for both parties -- not a continuation of the ""romance"".I also wanted the heroine to BE independent, get a spine, leave this jerk in the dust, and get a restraining order against him.A book on abnormal behavior? Maybe. A romance? No way.I truly wish Ms. Howard had re-worked this book, not just re-published it, as it cheapens her considerable talent."
1,One of the worst I have ever read!,"The book was terrible, horrible, hate inspiring, etc. Rhy is a total jerk and loser and Sally for being a supposedly self-reliant and intelligent reporter can't tell that her ex-husband (I won't even honor him with recognition) is walking all over her. When he was through with her I wouldn't be surprised if she had cleat marks down her back. Then when she finally leaves him she just convinces herself to fight for him. As if there were anything worth fighting over. All in all I felt like ripping up the book at about page 20 maybe earlier, but I have to much respect for books in general to do that so I'll just forget about it."
1,Independent what?,"The title has nothing to do with the story, which is about a woman who brings herself out of a marriage with a man who deserts her because she isn't 'woman enough for him.' A) Get over yourself. B) She took him back! Why? Because he's the hero? I'd call him an abuser, a poor husband, and someone she'd be better off without. Plus, she's not independent. Where's the self-esteem she worked hard for? Where's the interest and dedication to her job that was detailed in the first chapters? Gone. She goes right back to him, ruining years of hard work to bring her into a highly respected position in a newspaper company.A complete waste of time and effort."
2,The characters are not believable.,"I've read all of Linda Howard's books twice yet this is one I choose not to read again. The characters of Sallie and Rhys are somewhat far fetched. Sallie vacillated between very strong negative feelings towards Rhys one moment to being completed captivated by him in another. For an ""Independent Wife"" Sallie has little or no backbone. Linda Howard's talent as a writer has progressed far beyond this early book."
3,anonymous,"Out of all of Linda Howard's books I don't like An Independent Wife. I was mad that Sallie could go back to him for what he had done to her. Leaving her and wasn't there when she was pregnant. In a way I had hoped that she could make him pay; teach him a lesson later in the story. But I guess since she went back to him, it tells that she was truly was in love with him."
1,Yuck,"I love(d) Linda Howard. Usually, her strong characters, unusual situations and fluent writing make her books enjoyable. Unfortunately, this book contains characters that are too unrealistic, even for a romance novel. The lead female character made me want to scream or throw the book acorss the room, which I did after I read the rather poor final chapter."
1,This story reads like a stereotype of romance.,"It was easy to see this was a reprint, readers today would not put up with an overbearing male boss forcing his will on the heroine. Although the story has emotional impact, the amount of backstory and the demanding ""hero"" detracted from the effect."
1,Terribly Disappointed,"I have read many of Linda Howard's books and this one actually made me angry. This was not a romance story at all. The male character Rhy was a selfish controlling bully. I find it hard to believe that any woman would allow herself to be manipulated to the point of being a mindless idiot. This book is a insult to any woman who has been walked out on and has had the strength and fortitude to pick herself up and build a successful life for herself. This was not a romance story at all, and sends a very wrong message to any young readers out there."
1,An Independent Wife,"I have really enjoyed about eight or nine of Linda Howard's books. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. The plot is cliched, the characters are not likable in any way, and the entire story ranged from unpleasant to revolting. Even taking into account this was written in 1982, it is loaded with stereotypes and cliches."
1,Outdated - why in the world reissue this dinasour!,Very disappointed in publisher for trying to make this old outdated issue something brand new! If Ms. Howard has no new romance (she seems to be focusing in the hardback suspense area) please do not insult readers with this awful book. I highly recommend to all Linda Howard fans DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK - SEND A MESSAGE TO THE PUBLISHER!! Cannot stress how dated this book is for 1999 - Ms. Howard's publishers - take a hike until you either have something new or look at the wonderful backlog of series books she has to offer
3,Great Content...But Too Many Errors!,"This book goes way beyond a standard discussion of basic web application development with JSP, covering some great topics like XML, XSL, WAP, Struts, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed this breadth, and have added some great new ""tools"" to my repetoire as a result.HOWEVER, I've found a number of annoying syntax errors in the examples that have cost me many frustrating minutes debugging (especially in the Custom tag section). If the authors would have only tested their own examples, I think this would be an excellent book.Finally, you don't really get any consistency throughout this book, either stylistically or otherwise....but I guess you should expect that when you have 20-some authors writing 1 book."
4,Great for competent Java developers,"Although the level of this book is fairly advanced, it is very thorough in the topics it covers. Some reviewers seem to think it should be a little more basic, but maybe they should have read the introduction. It reads:""This book is aimed at anyone who knows the Java language and core APIs...""If this describes you, and you want a very in-depth coverage of this technology, you'll love this book."
2,Alt: How each Professional who wrote the book learnt JSP,"Since this is the work of several authors, there is a lot of overlap of content in the various chapters.It is evident from the chapters that some of the authors are new to JSP1.2 technology and some of them to Java itself, and they managed to get their work (in-progress) in this book!!! (Plus, got customers like me buy this book for a cool sum.)As an exception to every rule, some of the chapters in this book are good, especially the discussion on MVC and Filters."
3,Not for beginers,"I thought to learn JSP just by reading this book. I read several review comments on this book and other books. Fairly thougt to buy this one on hope of better explanation.Though I am new to JSP, but working on programming for 13 years.1. I did not get a streamline explanation to start the first program. Someplaces exaplanation is too much, I was lost.2. Explanation on Tomcat installation won't be helpful because of older versions.Those have already known JSP TAG, Bean etc. it may be helpful for them. But purely it is not for beginners."
5,Good as a Novel,"This book is awesome. The one thing I truly love about this book is the layout. I had zero experience in JAVA/J2EE and after the first chapter it all made sense. I Actually make time to read this book.The one thing this book does that no other I have read is tech the low level nuts and bolts along with top level syntax and make it make sense. For instance, the chapter on Servlets rocks. It teaches Servlets on both ""Here are Servlets"" and ""How to use them"".I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to learn JSP/Servlet environment. It is a great book to learn the big picture and be able to use all know features in the technology."
4,Good book for the Java Web Developer,"This book is one of the best book that i had read on JSP. The great code examples, coverage of lastest version of JSP and Servlets. I found this as the must read book for all the JSP professionals as it takes about all the features of this technology"
3,Its a good book hard to grasp the information,"This book contains a lot of information, but it is not well focused and its not very smooth to read.But its a good book."
2,Not for a beginner,"This is definitely not a book for the beginners. I am new to this technology and after reading couple of first chapters this book, I am all the more confused. Buy this book only if you've some prior experience. Otherwise, this book is a total waste of money."
3,the real truth,"This is one more arrogative book from wrox. I dont know but there is no direction for any user. It looks like copied code from different websites. How can a person utilitze this book , when he dont know the basics. One cannot fly in the sky without an airplane. I dont know but this is just wastage of money. There hast been no proper books for JSP till now. THe reason is quite commercial one.Most bigger companies dont want to promote JSP as this is the technology of future sultan zahir khan The"
4,One of the better ones!,"This is the third trimmer that I have owned. It trims my beard very even with little effort. The last trimmer I owned vacumed up the hair as it cut but it was not worth the uneven cut or number of times I had to run it across my face to get it to trim. This norelco cuts even the first pass. I was suprised that it took such a short time to trim myself up. It glides smoothly over my face and you cant even feel it cutting. I would have gave it 5 stars if they had half settings but all the trimmers I had used in the past have the same problem....the 2 setting is to short and the 3 setting is to long I tried putting it between the settings like I did with an old Maverick trimmer but this one will not stay, so now I just trim it on the 2 setting and wait till it grows a day or two and its perfect!"
4,Great Bargain,"I bought this to trim both my hair and my beard since I keep both the same, very short length. So far, so good. I've had it now for 1.5 years and it's enabled me to keep the exact look I want all the time. It's already saved me money from getting haircuts and since it only takes me me 15-25 minutes to do my head and beard I save a lot of time too. I like the multiple settings....the choices for length are very satisfactory. My only complaint is that Norelco claims the blades are self sharpening but I've noticed that the trimmer has gotten less efficient over time and that it now takes longer to trim my hair and beard. Having said that, my needs are fairly unique and this product meets those needs very well."
3,Wildly inaccurate but entertaining and easy to read -,"in short, pretty much on the money for kids. Ruth Weir makes famous figures much more approachable and less ""dry"" with her episodic, storylike approach."
5,Ambient dub masterpiece...,"A collection of rare or unreleased tracks from 1994-1998.Scorn's sound has truly evolved, from grindcore to ambient dub. Change is good, Scorn is good, this album is terrific. The 1st three tracks are the best, not to mention the remix by Coil. Ambient dub at it's finest. Buy this album, also available via Invisible Record's website at a great price."
2,Singing???,"Honestly, I love FATA. They are great but I just don't know what happened to the singing. There is a lot less on this album. Fran has an awesome voice and sings great but he doesn't do it very much on this album. The Fiction We Live was the album I started listening to these guys on. That is the best work from these guys by far. I hope there next album has more singing."
5,first time i use it and i love it!!!,"i like this ball its worth the price.we had a game last sunday in A.B.A and everytime we play we always need a ball to use,and there's bunch of ball on the court to pick and guess what the ref. chosed my tachikara ball,well we used til and of the game,we won the game,i guess this ball is good for indoor its sweat absorbing ,the microfiber cover is reall good it makes the ball soft...i hvnt try it for outside though.overall its a good ball this my first bball that i really like to use."
5,Excellent!,I've had this cookbook for 2 years now and have tried many of its recipies...They are SO GOOD! This cookbook gives a wonderful variety from many southern references of traditional and some contemporary creations. This is the most used cookbook I own. Really great!!
3,"Cute, but nothing special","This book is nice, although I didn't much care for many of the quotes. Also, it is quite small. Of course I would have known this if I had just read the information and/or looked more closely at the other reviews, so that is my own fault. Anyway, as others have said, not always the best photos and not the best quotes, but still a cute book if you like to look at kittens."
1,This will teach me to read the reviews first!,Poorly made. Lasted less than 2 months. If you want a good pack - KEEP LOOKING.
2,Not sturdy enough for teens.,"This looks great and holds a ton of items, but the durability of the handle on ours is very poor. The bar handle has broken twice, the first time within 2 weeks of purchase, the second just recently. We've had to literally put it back together with safety pins through the holes in the bar to keep it from coming all to pieces again. Wish the bar were as sturdy as the wheels and fabric. Not worth the high price for the hassle."
3,Short lived,"My eight yeat old needed a wheeled backpack, after waiting to her what she thought was forever, it arrived. She loved it! A week later while walking to school, one of the kids fell, and landed right on her week old backpack, snapping the handle off. I guess it was not meant to be.Wish the handle were a little bit strong to stand up to just a occurance.It was a grat backpack. Lots of room."
4,BackPack,Great backpack for the price! The bottom seems a little flimsy other then that a great product for the price.
1,Disappointed with this product,I thought this bag would have been great for my son to take to school but after 2 week the material has burst open at the seam. I am very disappointed with this product.
2,Rips easily,"Unfortunately the High Sierra RunAround Wheeled Pack, rips easily on the back bottom corners, because after only 15 days of use it is already, even though it was used taking care of it."
4,Great for students,"Great backpack for a student. There is plenty of room and it seems very well made. It could use a few more exterior pockets for gadgets but otherwise, I would reccomend this to anyone. Also, the wheels and the handle seem very strong and can withstand the abuse of a teen, I hope :)"
1,bad deal,poor quality. It lasted least than a year and the wheels went off.I should not recommend this product. Next time I will look for something that last more
1,Waste of money,Wow my daughter was very happy when she got it. But the next week the breakes broke!And then it got very drirty! Dont waste your money!
1,"Buyers be aware, don't buy this bagpack.",I got it for my son who is on 3rd grade. It did not last for a full year. The handle was broken after 5 month of use. I don't know if we can replace the handle but it is sitting in the garage storage right now.
4,Integration is the key!,"This book aids individuals interested in integrating their religious beliefs, physical and mental health, and connecting with the scared through body, mind, and soul.A wonderful piece of work, full of instruction and examples. A definate user friendly/teach yourself book! Written well and made to digest in small do-able pieces."
5,Journey,"This is a book I bought many years ago. It is a book I constantly pick up and reread as life unfolds for me. It had from the beginning given me insights that drew very close to my West-Indian upbrining. I constantly recommend this book to everyone, and anyone who is on a path to understanding the yearning in their soul. I know this book can, and will help them understand their journey."
3,If you have the time,"I agree with previous reviewer that the paper sticks together - but ""if you have the time"" to remove photo prior to the next one printing the paper is good quality"
1,Worst Photo Paper. Ever.,"I purchased the Canon Pixma ip8500 photo printer (best photo printer available) and this was the free pack of photo paper that Amazon gave for free as a promotion. Let me tell you, its not even worth getting for free. the five free Canon paper that came with the printer were way better than the Burlington. Even set on high print quality using a 5.0 megapixel image, the 4x6 picture printed with weird shading and lines. If you want your memories to last, dont use this paper!! The Canon Pixma printed great with Kodak and the best on the Canon paper."
2,Not for Laser Mice,"I've had a mouse rug at work for years so I bought this set for use at home. The design is very pretty and the matching coaster is great. I like that it's thinner than my old mouse pad, roughly half the depth.However, it does not work well at all with my laser mouse. Using an optical mouse is fine, but laser tracking is poor, resulting in very uneven pointer movement (drags, skips, drags some more).In addition, the surface is wearing away where my wrist rests against it. Granted, my home setup is not ergonomic (the desk is higher -- or my chair is shorter? -- than is optimal for computing), so there is more contact and friction between my wrist and the rug here vs. sitting at my work desk, but it didn't take very long before erosion started. The rest of the rug is still holding up fine, though."
3,Cute but sad...,"I really love these mini carpets. I think they are the cutest things ever and the matching coaster mat is adorable too. Sadly, my logitech optical mouse does not like them at all. I'm pretty sure it's the white laced in with the blue, if I remember right optical mice don't like white. I solved the problem by cutting a black piece of cardstock to fit in the center but I wish I could just use the mouse pad without it. Still cute, but a little disappointed."
3,"Good pilates primer, not so good execution","I am a Jennifer Kreis fan--her style of Pilates instruction (methodical, even-toned, not over the top motivational) appealed to me in her tapes (Target Specifics). That is why when I decided to go for a Pilates DVD, I was searching for her. Yet, this DVD is very different--she does not model the exercises. Instead, she walks around another model, talking through the poses and excercises. It may sound petty, but I found the result somewhat distracting as I was trying to follow both Jennifer and the model. When you are on the 90 repetition of the 100 breaths, that is no fun.I definitely recommend Pilates for DVD excersice, but would have prefered a DVD with people who appear in it that are in synch, rather than with an instructor walking around."
4,Enjoying using this DVD,I've had this DVD for about 3 months. When I purchased it I had done Pilates through VHS tapes I owned and a class that I took. I've used this DVD off and on. I enjoy Ms. Kries as an instructor and the instruction portion of the DVD is great. I found that after a few rounds of doing the DVD (as with any produced exercise video) I got bored hearing the instruction and wanted to power through the workout in less time. I simply fast forward through those parts or do the next exercise I know is coming up and then fast forward. One suggestion for the next DVD series: Have one session with full instruction. Then include a separate session with the same exercises in a flow--without the interruptions.
1,Don't waste your time on this product,I work with kids who love different and unusual noises. One of the kids loves these toys but due to excessive use my old ones were beginning to wear out. I bought these as a replacement and they were really not worth the money. They feel cheap and the noise was not very loud (really clunky and not smooth). I ended up returning them and getting a different set for a better value that was also better quality. Eight dollars a piece is excessive especially when they perform worse than the half broken ones I was trying to replace. There is another option for gravity tubes that comes in a 4-pack for around 14 dollars (Toysmith Spiral Gravity Tube #9295 4 Pack) which is a much better value and better quality.
2,As good as it gets?,"I recently returned from my second trip to Las Vegas. Completely in love with the city and wanting to know more about it, I purchased this video (which seemed to be highly recomended online). All in all, it was quite disapointing. The touted ""history"" section is a mind-numbing rush through the past - only a segway to what seem to be paid avertisements for the newest casinos. The images from the history are still photos which appear so briefly that you can barely tell what they are. The modern day material (which is actually what I wanted to see) is so poorly shot that you rarely get a full view. A close-up shot of some lion-head fountain hardly represents the scale and grandor of these amazing resorts/hotels. There may not be a better video of Las Vegas around, but this is barely worth a $2.75 rental fee, let alone the purchase price."
4,Good,"It's a clipboard. Makes an annoying sound when you move it around as the clip which has a hole in it moves freely. Other than that, it's a clipboard. The rulers on the side are useful and the page holder is sturdy and strong."
5,Clipboard,It is amazing. I personally hate when I my write is not perfect. This has been so helpful with my writing.
3,Share internet connections,"We purchased this to have a live backup connection to our T-1 (DSL line is the backup). It serves the purpose but you need a technical person to set it up.VPN is a problem. You cannot use standard windows VPN and the Netgear VPN client only works with certain versions of Windows, no 64 bit support, no Win 7 support and vista was problematic. Based a Web search Netgear has no idea when the VPN client will be updated. I don't understand why they will not allow the standard Windows VPN. Our technical person was able to make the shrewsoft VPN work.Only running a week but not problems so far."
5,Great product,I'm very pleased with this product and I highly recommend it:- The setup has been a breeze including setting up VPN connections from dynamic clients as well as from another router (a Cisco/Linksys RVS 4400N).- The performances are phenomenal (e.g. VPN set up time...)One recommendation: make sure you upgrade your firmware in the first place (so that you don't lose your previous configuration parameters)...One comment to the NetGear team: terrific job! It would be great to have more than 1 GB port in your future version(s) of this product...
4,Works lke a champ!,"I am a Netgear fan. I have a lot of equipment in my home, and have always found Netgear to be a reliable brand that just works! I had a fvs318 that worked great for years, but could not keep up with my upgraded Internet connection. I got 29M out of the modem, but it petered out to 7M by the time it got to the desktop. A new fvs318 made no difference. This baby hums! 29M right to my desktop with easy setup. I DO wish it had ore than one Gigabit port, but that's a minor hassle."
3,Sinple but effective,"It lacks some features, like a command-line dump of its configuration (it uses a proprietary binary format) and some routing features; but it works, and is cheap. We had problems with the stability of vpn channels when connecting to Juniper NetScreen equipment (the channels would go down at least weekly and have to be manually reset), so I'd stick to netgear-to-netgear vpns with this box."
2,died after 2 years,"Had it for 2 years, it was rebooting by itself until one day decided to reboot and never came back.I will try Zywall i read almost any other firewall is better than netgear FVX538."
1,The Walks are Hikes!,"I eagerly anticipated getting this book as Thomas generally puts out excellent guides/books. This one did not meet expectations..not by a long shot. The four walking tours basically follow the same roads as the auto tour routes and the tours are boring hikes as such ranging from 3.3 miles to 4.4 miles each. The ""hikes"" come with very, very sparce narratives and a few uninteresting photos. The horrible audio-taped bus tours provide more value..and they are bad. It does not even give details on the Big Round Top loop , Johnny Reb or Billy Yank trails AND one can get much better documented town tours of city center Gettysburg buildings from the tourist center or directly off the net. As the John Archer East Cemetery Gettysburg guide/book from Thomas gets 5 stars this gets the opposite, the worst. Save the money. Don't even think about getting this one."
5,Satchmo,"A great album by the 20th century's greatest musician. I also recommend ""Good Evenin' Everybody"" (1970 Newport dedicated to Satchmo's 70th birthday) and ""Happy Birthday Louis"" (60th birthday)."
2,Disappointing,"Sorry, but pretty much a waste of time and money. Disjointed, repetitive. Last section of book all fluff and filler. Writer denigrates virtually everyone involved in Afghanistan operations, except the Green Berets. Never misses a chance to say something nasty about non SOF personnel or organizations. He is very positive about President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld, but infers that Gen Tommy Franks is an ... I believe events have proven him incorrect about Franks, and history will prove his coverage of the conflict superfluous."
1,Fiction under another name,"It seems that Robin Moore has been taken in by the convicted felon Idema. As a result, at least part of the book is nothing but fiction. Puts all of the book under a questionable light."
1,Non-fiction Trash,"I would not have purchased this book had I known about the pure fiction told hear. This bookis nothing but a story about an ego-maniac based on inuendo, half-baked facts and made up story-telling. Please take it off the non-fiction list."
3,"ok, but not definitive","This is the same guy who wrote the first book about the Green Berets, which had to have been 50% fiction, way back in 1965. It's uneven. It could be better researched. Others criticize the lack of first hand accounts, and hearsay. It's an ok read, but it's not definitive, one needs other books for that. He did point out that widows and children of soldiers aren't treated very well, which was worth noting."
2,Biased but still interesting,"Ok, the book was very biased and it is hard to take Robin Moore serious when he writes the book like the diary of a teenage girl in love with a rock band (or in this case the Special Forces).I also find it hilarious that Mr. Moore's mysterious ""Jack"" character the one that shows up through out the book to do incredible deeds just got arrested in Afghanstan for running his own personal prision (see July issue of Time) and torturing people. Apparently this idiot was doing this all on his own with out goverment backing. To top it all off he was known by the media as some crack pop that would shot off at the mouth about all his heroic deeds.With all that said, I think that the book (with all of its propaganda) still makes the point of how brave the men and women are that participated in the events (even the one's that are not Green Beret that Mr. Moore never misses an opportunity to call ignorant)."
1,I was there,"The author is faced with a chance to write the story as it actually happened and Mr. Moore lost that opportunity. Now this book will forever be known as a complete work of fiction by those of us who were there, conducted the operations and then interviewed by Robin Moore as to what happened. Venturing too far off the path of validity was perhaps due in part to his ""buddy"" Jack Idema, who is referenced far too much throughout the book. Mr Idema is a compelete work of something else, just google search the name. In short, disappointing is too nice a word for the effort."
1,Do NOT buy this book.,"I read this book on a plane a couple of years back and am only reviewing it now because I've now learned that most of the story was totally concocted. I just finished Robert Young Pelton's Licensed to Kill, which details how ""Jack"" Idema--an ex-con who went to Afghanistan to track down OBL--fabricated most of this story, was able to trick the authors into believing that he was ex-SF, and profited from his outrageous, totally inaccurate story. It wasn't much of a book to begin with--way over the top--but the story behind it is pretty amazing.I would recommend Licensed to Kill if you're interested in what happened to ""Jack"" Idema. If you actually want to read about the Afghanistan campaign look at Masters of Chaos, First In, Down Range, and Not a Good Day to Die.Do not buy this book."
4,Interesting Book,"The book is really about the Green Beret in Afghanistan and the mission they undertook and the job they did. This book is not about J. Keith Idema ""Jack"" who has basically hijacked a book. If anyone has questions about Jack just call the Afghanistan Embassy in Washington D.C., or Special Forces Command at Fort Bragg. Mr. Idema is responsible for selling captured AQ Tapes to the Media instead of turing them over to Special Forces.I would have rated the book five stars but I removed one of the stars because of Mr.Idema...."
1,"High Hopes, Big Disappointment","Considering the ""Transformational"" way we fought and won the war in Afghanistan, the inovative use of special forces from throughout the services and particularly the groundbraking conventioanl-unconventional force mix, I had high hopes for this book. Instead, it was a bombastic, highly subjective account of a few Special Forces actions. There was zero effort at analysis, crticism, and implications. In short, a big disappointment. I would recommend this book to a bored 12 year old, but not to any serious adult interested in the evolving nature of warfare."
1,A worthless book,This is the most poorly written book that I have ever read. If I could rate it zero stars I would have done so. I did not finish it and it is one of the few books that I have ever thrown into the trash. Other reviewers that were there say that it is largely fiction. Robin Moore and Random House have pulled a scam in order to make a few dollars.
3,"Remember ""Rashomon""","If you remember ""Rashomon,"" enough said. The ""real"" story (as if there were such a thing) remains to be told.The ""good guys"" will still be the good guys. But the most knowledgeable narrators, often lacking in Moore's second-hand account, eventually will give us a far more accurate and refined picture of how a comparatively few extraordinarily capable American soldiers (and CIA field operatives) toppled the monstrous Taliban tyranny while destroying Al Qaeda in Afghanistan."
