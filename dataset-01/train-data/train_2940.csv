3,cab,"A little smal but it looks great. Don't follow thw direction as written, don't do the doors until the end of putting it together, they can easly be put on then. if u follow the direction the doors will keep falling off and u may breat the glass in the doors."
1,Don't Buy It,This product was garbage I spent 3 1/2 hours putting it together and the shelves did not fit inside. This was very frustrating then I had to spend 1 hour taking apart and boxing it up for return. I was very angry grrrrrrrrrrrr.
1,wish I had not ordered this,"Wish I had read the reviews before ordering this item. I read reviews today. Went to ""my orders"" to cancel ""my order"" but it has ""shipped"" & I can't cancel. The reviews sound ""very bad/very disappointing"". The image of this CD cabinet is beautiful & ""just what I want""; OR I wouldn't have ordered it! It is very bad IF the cabinet is NOT acceptable AND is ""false advertisement""!!"
3,Poor fit and finish,"The cabin itself is pretty nice,especially for the price; however, the fit and finish is poor. The hinges on one of the doors was installed about an inch too low (so the door wouldn't fit on the cabinet) and the notches on one of the shelves for the shelf supports were missing."
1,Not what you think,"I purchased this to hold our DVD's, needless to say when I put it together, the doors don't align up together, let alone one don't even close all the way.It barely fit all of our DVD's, the picture appears larger than realistic.I do not recommend this, if you are going to pay the amount for this just for your DVD, and you have one for your CD, you're better off, paying more and getting a larger cabinet."
1,Attractive piece of furniture but major flaws,"Even though I read all the reviews first regarding the support brace and the door to magnet line up I decided to take my chances. I should have listened. These are two very important design flaws, I wish the manufacturer would take these issues into consideration before making another cabinet. A total waste of money."
3,Winsome wood dvd cabinet,"Nice looking cabinet...just like the picture. Only complaint is, as referenced in other reviews, if you install the back brace piece (which I think you really should...not overly sturdy) you can't fill the middle shelf. If you do, you can't close the doors. I use that shelf for a couple of dvd boxed collections. I can position them on the shelf where they don't interfere with the doors. Considering the price, appearance and functionality, my husband and I are very happy with the purchase, and may buy a second one."
3,Cheap. Small. Does the trick for the price.,"No bass. Certainly not designed to be audiophile speakers. Look OK but feel awful; made of lightweight, flimsy plastic. Basic cheap computer speakers, not suitable for prolonged music listening, but what do you expect for the price?"
2,don't bother,"There are better options for $20. These sound on par w/ $5 speakers. There's no weight to them and the left speaker slides around the desk just from the pull of the weight of the thin wire coming out the back. Sound quality might be acceptable if you're only listening to an AM radio station, low quality youtube videos, or a book on tape, but these cannot reproduce music with any clarity at all.The only reason I gave them two stars is because they look nice."
2,It's like he didn't actually write anything,"I can't even tell where the author is actually the author here. He doesn't describe anything, just lists fact after fact about the board. Very hard to follow and read. Pretty lame book."
3,AVR programming information,"Ok I originally bought this book from a friends advice. I wanted to learn more on a newbie level how to code AVR chips, using the C language. Unfortunately, most books in this area cost upwards of $65 into the hundreds. Not the type of money I was looking to spend, and definately can not afford! As easy as it is to search the internet for free tutorials? No way! Anyway, about this book. Its a good reference manual to explain all the status registers, pins, features, and lookup terms that normally confuse starters and newbies (like me). Learn how to code? No way! DONT GET CONFUSED! This is a decenet reference / lookup guide at best. Very few program and code examples, and if you dont know how to program or getting started, then this book leaves you little help. Its definately useful as a guide or reference - like me, I often forget what does what, and this book easily allows you to learn the ports and settings needed to drive you through online tutorials."
1,Alot of fluff in this book wish I spent more time in the book store and looked over it more!,This book is REALLY fluff.. No real substance. I really wished I spent a little bit more time looking over this book at the bookstore. I just spent 1.5 hrs and skimmed through the whole entire book. The author glosses over a lot of things that I would think would be important. In particular I was hopeing for more information on USB and CAN interfaces. Two things that are a major part of the newer AVR devices. Very disapointed.read this book at the bookstore! Don't buy it because you can probably read through it in a matter of 1hr or so. This book maybe ok for a complete beginner but if you have had any microprocessor programing experience (I got some PIC) its very limited. Like other posters have stated you can get more info from AVRfreaks.com or Amtel datasheets.
2,"A fair book, but not really worth the money","This book is not worth the money, in my opinion. The Author rehashes data sheet information, and lists the instruction set, but all that can be gotten for free from Atmel's website.The projects that he lists are scant on details.I didn't come away from reading it with any real insights into the AVR that I didn't get from reading freely available information. Given the price of the book, I would recommend you pass on this one."
1,Dissapointing,The author has primarily recycled information already available from Atmel and on the web. The coverage of compilers ignores several popular 'C' compilers including the GNU port and Imagecraft. This is inexcusable given that one of Atmel's primary objectives was to develop a microprocessor targeted at the 'C' development environment. The section on interfacing with LCD displays is inadequate. It presents some very basic information regarding what is possible and does not follow through with a well illustrated example. This last statement is true of much of the book. Save your money and spend more time surfing the web. I am still waiting for a good AVR book.
2,This book is old,There is some usable information here but much of the code is not very well documented like the LCD software. Better off justdownloading examples and data sheets from avrfreaks.comMarginally useful for beginner.
1,Copy and Paste,Half of this book is just copy and paste from the Atmel Datasheet. The other half are several projects that gives little explanation of what's going on in the project. Don't waste your money buying this book. Download and print Atmel AVR Datasheet. You learn more that way. The datasheet is much more complete and clear. They are also constantly updated.
2,An exposition of the data sheet,Most of what you find in this book is what you will find in the data sheet on Atmel's web site. I am a beginner in this area (micros/ programming) and this book isn't of much use to me right now. Perhaps someone with more experience with micros could get more out of it.
1,Pitiful,"Lasted 4,900 miles/ 9 months. Moog used to be quality. Since Federal-Mogal bought it, moog and the other companies under the Federal-Mogal umbrella are junk. :("
3,Nice,"Nice seat covers, feels soft and nice.But you should fit it better than I was able to or it would not have a snug-fit appearance.It depends on how well you do it.Overall a very nice product."
5,Best Book Yet,"I have studied with all four of Audrey Grant's previous series: the Club, Diamond, Heart and Spade books and I think, for basic information, Bridge Basics 1 is the best. It is not only easy to read but easy to understand. With her charts and practice lessons, one can learn a lot about bridge without ever taking a class."
1,Not good,"This is a book on how to play bridge and yes, I understood it was used but...there was writing on many pages and all the end of chapter quizzes were written in with notes...many in ink so the book is basically unusable!"
2,Lawrence's only failure,"Mike Lawrence is quite simply the best bridge teacher-author ever. All of his books are of consistently high quality, including his 'Look over my shoulder while I play' books such as ""Dynamic Defense"", ""Play Bridge with Mike Lawrence"" and ""Play a Swiss Team of Four with Mike Lawrence."" These books are not only wonderfully instructive and well written, they are FUNNY. The vignettes at the table are described with such wry detail that the reader feels pangs of loss when these books end. Unfortunately, this book, which contains no bridge, and concentrates on describing humorous table vignettes, is NOT FUNNY. Disappointing, but I felt much better after only a few pages of ""Card Combinations."""
4,Modern bridge,"Grant is clearly written and gives the novice useful information, many examples, quizzes, and complete hand play reviews for practice and reinforcement. Follow up with book 2 especially if the group you plays wants to be more competitive."
5,Good way to learn,This is a excellent book for those wanting to learn to play bridge. It is easy to understand and the presentation order is very logical. It is also a good book for review by experienced players. I lost my first copy and I'd liked it well enough to buy a second copy.
3,Very Informative. But could be more interesting.,"Generally it is a good DVD with extensive materials.However, the way to organize those materials is not interesting enough--most of the materials are quatations by prominent people, drawings, paintings, plus the narration. Though there are scenes of violin playing (almost only by Kremer, and only the violin or part of the violin is shown), the scenes are not exciting and celebrating. As a result, watching this DVD is like reading a book.I think the author might have used more intersting ways to present the history, such as scenes of actors' imitating the historical activities, scenes of violin playing by more different violinists, as used in some successful documentary DVDs,"
1,booooring,"Save your money! totally tame, dull and uninteresting, just a few stories that really are pretty lame. Could have done with a big fat injection of of excitement, kissing or event a hint of sex??"
4,What's with the bad reviews?,"I'm a big fan of Obital and this album did not leave me wanting. I can understand why some long time fans may not enjoy it as much as their older stuff, but it is still great, and you can't beat the used price for a double CD of mostly enjoyable tracks. It get 4 stars because there are tracks here not up to my Orbital standards, but this is still a great album with all the tracks at least being worth listening to. I have to say I love the Doctor Who tribute, that theme song is awsome and only the KLF seems to have realized that. I'd buy it for that track alone but there are so many others that are great too. If your are a techno or electronica fan, get this album. U won't be disappointed. There is such variety here you can't go wrong."
4,I have everything by orbital and this one didn't....,"didn't give me anything new. I'm waiting for something from them. I don't know what it is but this is not it. I like it, but compared to all the other orbital albums I own (all of them) this one does not challenge me. There is something cutesy about it."
5,Orbital does it again!!!!!!!!,"What can I say? Orbital does it one more time. Similar to ""Snivilisation"" but perhaps a bit wilder, still that familiar Orbital sound shines through with the Hartnoll brothers' newest album ""The Altogether."" Song 10 - Illuminate....awesome, classic orbital. ""Doctor?"" is a great mix of the doctor who theme. Like Tool and Orbital? Tootled is a great mix, great tune. I've only listened to this disc a few times, but it's in my collection and I love it already."
2,Dissapointment,"Ever since I heard Orbitals ""Middle of Nowhere"" album, I loved their style and they became one of my favorite electronic artists. I collected all of their albums, remixes, and rarities. When I bought this album, I was very excited hoping this would be just as good if not better than their previous releases. I clicked to the first song and it started off pretty good. As I listened futher, it became boring and repetitive, nothing I had come to expect from Orbital. Anyways, what I am trying to say is that if you really want a good Orbital alnum, DONT PICK THIS ONE! Download it and save yourself some money."
2,Not very good,"It's hard to be honest - as I really wanted to like, even love, this album just as much as their other ones - but I must be truthful, and therefore I must say this album is the worst ever. It is hard to see great artists sell out and commercialize their music, but Orbital has done so and their new album is nothing more than a watered down, phony imitation of their previous work. They didn't need to change, and in effect ruin their music, but they have on this album. Check out their previous albums, they are all very good - contrary to this new one. I hate to say it, but giving it two stars is really being nice."
5,Gradually appreciated genius.,"Once again the Brothers Hartnoll have succeeded in blowing my mind. I first discovered Orbital when I picked up ""the Brown Album"" back in 1993 or so. Their first two albums had an immediate appeal to me. All of their work since, I've had to really listen to in order to truly appreciate. This album is one of those. While the second disc consists largely of spin-offs (I don't want to devalue these tracks by referring to them as mere re-mixes) from 1999s ""Middle of Nowhere,"" they are still vastly entertaining. Of note are the tracks ""Beelzebeat,"" ""Funny Break (One is Enough)"" and ""Illuminate"" with David Gray (which is an unusual vocal direction for Orbital, but I think it works well). Even though I love variety, I still go back to this album again and again over a year after its release. Phenomenal!"
4,"Not as good as their previous CD, but still well worth it","If you like Orbital then you will like this CD but it will sound like they took a step backwards musically. Orbital neophytes should steer clear, get ""Snivilization"" or ""Middle of Nowhere"" instead."
3,not quite what i hoped for,"This album was kinda a dissapointment.im not entirely sure what the idea of this album was.the style seems to have reverted back to orbital's early 90's music with slow paced beats and playful sounds, but there is a undeniable ammount of modern dance techniques.At times, the music seems like it was designed to keep you distanced from it so you cant enjoy it. the flow on this album is often inconsistant and many sounds are just plain annoying. i am very curious as to why the brothers did some of this stuff,i guess the way it seems to me is orbital has no idea where to go with the music. their old style of electronica is fast losing popularity versus newer styles of dance and trance. this album seems at a tug of war between old and new, and also between beuty and uglyness. i can only hope orbital finds their identity before they try for a new album"
2,fall of the king,"how could one of the most innovative groups in modern electronic music make such a dissapointing album. How can this be the two brothers who gave us the amazing InSides and Brown Album. they are either rehashing the past on this album with sounds and rhythms we've already heard out of them, or they are taking tragic missteps. If it wasnt for Funny Break and Illuminate I would never listen to this album... well in the MP3 age, I actually don't have to anymore...Lets hope the Blue Album will be a proper swan song"
2,You've got to be kidding me.,"This new release really disappointed me. I've been a Orbital fan since the first album, and I've purchased everything they've ever released. The last album, ""The Middle of Nowhere"" was their most brilliant album ever, and then they follow up with this one, which in my opinion is their worst album ever. It lacks the intricate arrangement/melody they are so good at, and the new ""experiements"" fail miserably. The songs with vocals are just horrible. This makes me doubt the quality of their next album."
2,Truly Dissapointing,"I can honestly say that Orbital has gone downhill... There are some good tracks but for the most part, don't get your hopes up."
5,very good,"as a long time orbital disciple, I was thrilled to see orbital follow up their worst album (""middle of nowhere"") with one of their best (as far as I'm concerned they have never topped ""snivilisation""). the songs are shorter, yes, but that doesn't make them any less creative or captivating. many people seem to dislike the David Grey collaboration, but I find it to be a fabulously catchy & sweet track. the only misstep (in my opinion) is track 5 (""tootled""), which is immediately followed by the best track (#6, ""last thing""). it's a great disc, but i dont think that its going to win over any person who wasn't already a fan.i'd also suggest picking up the ""funny break"" import single for the non-album track ""beezlebeat."""
3,NOT THE FULL 2 DISC CD!!!,I thought this was going to be the 2 disc cd but it isnt... :( Too bad cause the second disc is the one with all the good remixes!!!
3,Poorly defined songs,"I really liked ""Funny Break"" and ""Illuminate"", lovely synth melodies and vocals. But didn't quite understand the rest of the album, and eventually got tired of it. The final impression I got is that the two brothers felt the same while recording most of it.I strongly recommend the pre-middle of nowhere work (including it): Featuring Alison Goldfrapp on vocals."
5,the best album,"this album is the best in my collection and the best orbital have released. the layered sound , the enegy and the feeling you get from listening to this album is amazing. totally recommend to fans of trance, electronic and other dance music"
2,alas no video,"Hans Andre Stamm's Bach Greatest Organ works was so wonderful, I thought this would be, too. But this has no video of him playing. In fact no video at all, Whether or not that is why the sound doesn't seem as fine as vol.2, by all means, if you can afford it, buy vol. 2, not vol. 1."
1,Bach organ works,"Caveat Emptor! This is primarily an audio DVD version of the video. It contains only one video number. If you didn't notice this, as I didn't, it turns out to be a gyp. To say the least, I was very, very disappointed."
3,Runs on the small side,"I purchased these as a XXL, fits more like an L-XL. I can't wear them, they are way too small."
5,The olsen twins are great!,"In this book, Nine year old twins, Mary-Kate and Ashley, go off to hawaii and make sand castles, surf, swim, goon jet skies, and have fun with there friends! This is one of my favorite stores about the olsen twins. I like their younger books better when they were little girls. Such as The Adventures of Mary-kate and Ashley and Your invied to mary-kate and ashleys and Full House Michelle and The New Adventures of Mary-kate and Ashley and Full House Sisers and Two of Kind, these are much better then when their teenagers when all they think of is boys and clothes!"
2,Not for everyone,"The songs are not that good, and the performance of them is fair. There are a few bright spots on this otherwise not very interesting collection. For those that are not used to silly nonsense songs this is not for you."
2,Technical Interest Only,The fact that this was made with consumer equipment and has bigger budget look makes it worth watching for the aspiring no-budget Feature maker but the plot is nothing more than shock masquerading as a compelling story.
1,Cockroaches appropriate for garbage film,Worst film I ever saw. Dull and boring. It rambles on and on about an incestuous releationship between a brother and sister. Even the so called artistic photography is bad. Complete waste of time and money on this one.Doesn't even have an end to it. It just stops. And that's the best part.
4,sim supply,"cooler is excellent product however, due to a computer glich i ended up with 2 coolers. i emailed sim supply and as of this review a month has gone by and no response. now i am stuck with a second cooler costing $82 with shipping. so beware of sim supply, the return policy sucks."
1,copied and pasted from somewhere,"This book is a real dissapointment. There is no 'adventure' here. It's just a list of museums from around the country. Now these are nice museums, but perusing the AAA Tourbooks will give you the same information for free. This books is a waste of money."
4,Splines are more than you thought,"This is a very nice book about splines for all who needs interpolation of data and are getting a bit nervous about the somewhat improper behaviour of normal cubic splines, i.e., the ones you learned about in your undergrad exam. The author provides both illustrative examles with computer codes (in FORTRAN) and describes the necessary theoretical background. Compared with many other books, it is readable also for a non-mathematician, although some experience with numerical analysis will be most helpful."
5,Must buy for good and interesting eating in London,"Don't be misled by the title. This book lists restaurants from cheap fish and chips to steaks. She has reviewed affordable eating places and includes fascinating stories about each one. Some of the places are just little shops but she also includes the popular Hard Rock Cafe. The book is well organized and categorized including lists by price range, lists by sections of London, lists by type of cuisine, and a convenient glossary of English food terms like ""bangers and mash"" which is sausage and mashed potatoes. There are even recommendations about tipping, British beer, and what to do in a traditional British pub.My favorite places out of this book were The Fryer's Delight for fish and chips and Fortnum and Mason's for tea. So if you want to stay away from fast food joints and tourist traps this book will steer you towards excellent economical eating."
5,Fun and accurate,I have been to more than 15 of the restaurants in book I agree 97 percent with Susan although I give higher marks to Piere Victorie than she did it is a chain and my spot may be better than one she went to.
5,The Cheap Eats/Sleeps Books Are The Best,"I have used Ms. Gustafson's books for 4 trips to London and one trip to Paris, and I have nothing but praise for her recommended restaurants, and hotels. If you want the best value for your travel dollar, all of her Cheap Eats/Sleeps books are must."
5,A wonderful resource!,"I've been looking for this type of book for a while now. Michael Bavota works with training and marketing for seafood retailers, and he gives us plenty of useful information here about seafood, how it should be handled, how it is harvested, and most importantly, how to cook it! There are dozens of recipes here from very simple to more elegant. I found the menu suggestions at the end of each recipe to be very helpful as well. It is written in a very down to earth style that I always find refreshing, as well. I love books like this, which combine great information with practical, non-daunting recipes that anyone can follow. Kudos to Mr. Bavota!"
5,Of present Being in a delegitimated past,"Powerful and informative analysis of complex trends in 20th Century French philosophic thought. With our growing consensus on the limits of knowledge, language, and the 'human', this text situates and clarifies the value and influence of Hegel minus metaphysics and the richness of Nietzschean inquiry still possible given Heidegger's ultimate limit of the return of the Same.If we recognize Lacan's human-as-barred-subject, our only 'sensible' project, given one's structure, is pursuit of a 'reasonable' libidinal economy. History as parallel with no enlightened EndState leave us with the same injunction for social action. But we continue to insist ""Che Vuoi?"" Outstanding scholarship and wonderfully referenced."
1,Very Disappointed!,"This CD is NOT Flamenco! I'm not sure exactly what to call it, but it is not Flamenco. And half the time the guy hits some really off-key notes. I would not recommend this CD to anyone. If you want to hear some great guitar music by someone who knows how to play the guitar, try music by the guitarist known as Pavlo."
5,great but...,"a fantastic collection of paco's pieces but definitely not a complete one. if you're really into flamenco then this is not enough paco de lucia for you... i recommend other albums like zyryab, solo quiero caminar, almoraima, siroco, recital de guitarra (which amazon, unfortunately, does not carry in stock) and many more."
4,Good stuff,"This is my first introduction to the flamenco style in general, and to Paco in particular. Both volumes of Antologia are a great listen. He is a very good guitarist and the music is very easy on the ears. Sit back and enjoy."
1,This Version Sucks!,"Don't Buy this version. Scott O'Grady sued everyone in sight of 20th Century Fox for making a movie and promoting it with the Original ""Behind Enemy Lines"" Version of this Documentary. The original was Breath-Taking, this one Sucks!"
5,so nice to have warm feet,"I recieved these for Christmas. I have cold feet all the time. I need to warm them twice - the first time to bring my feet up to room temperature, and the second to warm them, but that is not a falt of the procuct - my feet are just too darn cold! I wish I had know about these years ago!"
3,$ better spent buying an electric throw!,"The booties are only good if you're willing to just lie around and do nothing because they're so cumbersome/heavy (with top and bottom heat packs) and no elastic around the ankle to keep them up at all so you can't get up to do anything. Heat is nice but definitely doesn't last long, in my experience. I think $ would be better spent buying an electric throw."
3,Comfort Booties,"This product is serviceable. It performs its basic duty to warm feet; however, the sock potions are skimpy and difficult to negotiate. The quality of the exterior material could be better."
2,Leaves tops of feet cold,"These booties are ok. Has a strong aroma when heated. I have size 11 shoe, this is a hard to pull on. Beads, which heat up in the micro wave are hard to keep in place. Heats the bottom of feet, leaves the tops of my feet cold. Also very hard to walk in and I mean just across the room. I will keep looking for a better pair.Try these instead I really like them - Therall Therapeutic Foot Warmers."
5,"Ohhh, the warm toesies!","I have a ground floor, north facing office. No sun and my feet are resting on tile over concrete over cold Maine earth.Last year, I tried a space heater. If I stuck it under my desk and rested my feet directly upon it, they got kind of warm. And I was always shorting out the electricity. Which wasnt very helpful.I just tried these for the first time...my shoes were still wet from yesterday (stepped right in a puddle), so feet were cold, damp and chilled through. And ohhh, arent these booties nice! Not only are the bottoms heated, but the top over the toes.Oh, so nice!"
2,Warm but very bulky and heavy,"I was looking for a product to warm my feet in bed before going to sleep. They did not work for this purpose. I have small feet (size 6.5) and the booties being one-size-fits all are extremely big, heavy and bulky for me to wear while in bed.On the positive side they really warm up your feet if you are sitting reading or watching TV because then the bulkiness and heaviness can be bearable."
3,Leaking beads upon arrival,Removed the inserts when the slippers arrived only to discover that the seams had not been completely sewn shut on 2 of the 4 inserts. Used my sewing machine to close and reinforce all the seams and don't expect any more problems. But the beads weren't fun to pick out of the living room carpet so I could put them back into the inserts.The hole left when the seam isn't sewn shut is small; I wonder if this was the real cause of leaking beads mentioned by other reviewers.
5,Great customer service and product.,"My feet are always cold, whether it's summer or winter. These booties are very easy to use, and maintain. They have inserts that can be pulled out when needed (top and bottom), so you can throw the booties in the washer/dryer without damaging the inserts. The smell is very nice: lavender and chamomile. The fabric itself isn't as soft as I expected but I haven't washed them yet, so that might change. I'm a size 8 and it seems these could fit up to a size 9 or 10. They do a good job at warming my feet, and are very relaxing. I was particularly impressed with the way Therapeutics handled this purchase, they included free samples and a wooden massager, which were a nice surprise. They also used UPS with no extra charge to me. I often have problems with deliveries with USPS in my area (mail and packages lost, sent to the wrong address...), so UPS really made a difference for me."
5,AWESOME!!,"I bought these for my girlfriend for christmas. I was a bit unsure since it didn't really say how long they stay warm for. She LOVES them, and they stay warm for a long time... about 45 mins. to an hour... Some similar products claim that the microwaveable boots are not meant to be walked on. She walks on them all the time and they are still fine. Excellent buy!!"
3,too small,"These booties smell glorious and they're very soft. I however could not get them over the heel of my size 11 feet. I guess I should have known that ""one size fits all"" is never true! I bought them as a gift for my sister, but her feet are almost as big as mine, so I warned her that she may have to cut a slit in the back to get them on. These need to come in sizes so people will know they will fit."
5,Wonderful,Got these as a Secret Santa gift for a coworker. She LOVED them. It's a perfect gift for that person you're not sure what to buy for. Everyone wants to be comfortable. They were soft and smelled great.
3,Christmas Gift,"Honestly, Christmas is a week away and these are for my daughter --- so I can't give an opinion either way. I am sure she will let me know how they work out, though !"
1,Earth Therapeutics Antistress microwaveable booties,I was very disappointed in these booties. Compared to the ones I had used for years and by mistake my husband microwaved them too long. These do not retain the heat nearly as long and are cold in less than one hour. I plan to try to find ones more similar to my original ones.
1,NOT AT ALL AS DESCRIBED,"These booties are AWFUL. They are 1.) Absolutely HUGE-- unless you have size 12 feet, forget about these. And forget about walking because they are the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS EVER, it is like walking around on rocks. Even if you are just lying in bed they are so big, they fall right off your feet. I can not smell ANY of the aromatherapy, and these do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. What a HORRIBLE waste of money DO NOT BUY this item."
1,Fell apart,"Design was exactly what I wanted, and they felt so good when I put them on after being on my feet all night. I never walked on them, just wore them in bed, but the bags inside fell apart within days, leaving me with beans all over the place. I wore them maybe 5 times before they were trashed. Don't buy."
3,Good idea,Gave these to my daughter as a gift and when she opened the pockets in the booties a bunch of the little pellets fell out. She will now have to put them back in the little bag and stitch up. Hope this doesn't become and issue.
2,Disappointed,"Pretty puzzle but was missing two pieces. Thought this was supposed to be a ""new"" puzzle. I won't be ordering any more puzzles."
5,got to love it.......,im a dj and i play alot of old school jams in my mixes.this is great collection of r&b funk jams.
5,The good years,"Each episode of the early seasons lofts far above the majority of the recent dribble, now mostly sensationalist schlock. But if you take a look at this or season one,(i can't wait for season 3!), you'll know why, or remember why, this show has endured for so long. This is genuine quality TV, and i hope with all my heart that the current trend of, well, crappiness will end soon, very very soon. The show should go back to it's basics, because it's so good at it."
4,"Great season, but one inaccuracy drove me crazy!","It's great to have the first two seasons on DVD--some of the episodes hadn't made it to TNT reruns (or if they did I missed them).Most of the episodes in this season are compelling--but I did miss Greevey.I found one inaccuracy so frustrating though. The episode where the child's body had been discovered after missing for 31 years had the child wearing a ""Kennedy for President"" button. The election was in 1960 and the child had been missing since October 1962, the year of the Cuban Missile crisis. Plus I believe this season was filmed around 1990, so if he was missing since 1962 that would have been 28 years...Didn't anyone do a fact check (or a math check?)"
3,"Liked the shows, didn't like the cast","I'm glad to see that Season 14 is coming out now because I would have hated to wait for it if all the seasons came out in turn. I do not intend to buy any season before Season 5 because the cast of the first few seasons does not interest me. First of all, there are no women. Secondly, I do not care for Michael Moriarty and Richard Brooks; give me Sam Waterston and his lovely assistants. Steven Hill and Chris Noth are good, but Paul Sorvino is no Jerry Orbach and Dann Florek doesn't hold a candle to S. Epatha Merkeson. When they finally got the casting right, the show went from a good one to a great one. It's too bad it took five years to come together."
5,Confession,"Great show and cast, I can watch this show day and night, love love love this show. very intense from start to finish.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
5,Happy Husband,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband who loves the ""old"" Law & Order.Arrived quickly and was in great shape."
4,Law & Order hits its stride,"I never really connected with Max Greevey(George Dzundza), and though it was a not-so noble end for him, Law and Order seemed to take a stronger direction in season two. Michael Moriarty grew into the character of Stone more completely, and though Paul Sorvino was a very good role model, mentor for Mike Logan's(Chris Noth) troubled, on the edge persona, his brief stay with the series didn't give him a chance to grow. What I really noticed in year two, was that the storytelling style really came together, the stories themselves were stronger, and the forced melodrama we often saw from supporting roles in year one, started to gel as rea, believable drama. I really became hooked on the series after seasons two and three. Great television, well worth owning! Jerry Orbach for Prez!"
3,ok,"slow beginning. The coloring or background of season 2 is too dark, and the sound quality is poor; so this affects being able to follow the plot."
1,DON'T BOTHER ORDERING THIS BOOK!!,"WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY...TO NEED THIS BOOK YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE TRULY GIFT WRAP CHALLENGED. THE LAYOUT OF THIS BOOK IS TERRIBLE, NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL! THIS BOOK MAKES ME WONDER IF MAYBE I SHOULD WRITE A ""GOOD"" BOOK ON GIFT WRAPPING. WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK!! $19.95!!! GOLLY!! PLEASE DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS BOOK."
2,Wouldn't buy again.,"Would like to have seen the pictures for the packages next to the description on how to do each one. The book is divided into instructions and then in the back the pictures. Should I have wanted to do one of the ideas, I would have to flip back and forth. I thought the kid-theme packages were cute, but the others just weren't my taste. The Lighted Wreath was a good idea but the battery needed to make the wreath blink was bare and visible on the package between the bow and the wreath. The photographs also looked ""home-took"" and fuzzy. Isolating them on a plain black background, using professional lighting, and a better camera would have brought out the detail in her artistic work. My eye was also distracted by the clutter around the packages which didn't add anything to the wrapping techiniques. I applaude anyone for putting together a book on what they love to do, and this one might have been great had there been more professional direction in its layout and production."
5,Superlative Highlife,"This is an infectious mix of catchy, melodic guitars, muted trumpets and drunken harmonies. Most of the songs sound like they were recorded on mono in a backstreet studio. Compilations can get boring after a while, but not this one. It's beautiful, I love it. Buy it."
1,Expert Advice,"This movie, along with all the other dubbed versions of Cardcaptors Sakura, is a rip off. Unless you are on a serious budget or are giving this to a person you loathe, do not buy this. Buy the Sub. version. It is not that hard to read the subtitles."
1,Yet another waste of plastic,"Again with the annoying Kids WB version. The least they could do is add Kero's Corner in the DVD (like how they broadcasted the Nelvana version here in Canada). The extras is one pathetic character summary. I said it before, I'll say it again... the subtitled version may not be as great compared to other DVD titles, but its definitely worth the few more dollars to this load of blashpemous crap."
3,"Cute Video, But fails with dubbing","this video has wonderful characters and breathtaking animation. i would have given it 5 stars, but its dubbing totally deprived it of its original zeal. Kero remains his cute self, Li is unsocial but still shows signs of his fondness for Sakura, and Sakura, the main character, demonstrates her beautiful personalities. Strength, friendship, determination, and bravery is only the begining.A great role model for kids. this movie is going to entertain all ages, even though it seems self-deprived of its first excitement in the Japanese version ."
5,A Moment of Joy,"Bliss Now is a beautifully rendered, intimate tale of one of the great saints of our age. Swami Ramananda's account of his salvation within the forest of Vrindaban has flushed me with tears more than once. And anything that brings me closer to Sri Sri Ma is worth the rewards of a lifetime. Everyone must read this Joyful account."
3,He is so full of himself,"I have read many many spiritual books. I have never met any 'spiritual teacher' who is so full of himself, so vain and so patronizing as this swami. I am sorry if that sounds harsh but I just couldn't take his spiritual boasting any more. He even has the cheek to say in his introduction, 'may I give you permission to be happy and to laugh?' Errh,..no, I neither need nor want to have your permission for anything. Most of this book reads as if the author is on acid or manic-depressive. He is either on cloud nine in thrilling enthusiasm or suicidal and about to starve himself to death.I give this book 3 stars soley for his description of Anandamayi Ma which I enjoyed. The rest was simply awful. Sorry."
2,Too Big and not as easy as they say...,"I was going to return this item, but did not want to go through the hassle. It is too big to suit me. It is also not as easy as they say to use. to get the growl you have to use your vocal chords and kind of say, ""ahhhhhhhh"". There is a ""pack bugle"" that I really wish I had ordered instead. I won't say that this is a BAD bugle, but it is big and I am hunting from a backpack."
3,The Perfect Tool does have a few pitfalls!,"I have heard a lot of great things about this impact driver - so much so, that I bought one to replace my burned out 3 year old 12V Bosch. I was immediately impressed with its power and light weight. It was great for driving screws - but not much else. Here are some things to consider before buying one - It only accepts quad drivers and specific hex bits so if you were planning to use it as a drill as well, prepare to invest in a new set of bits. The multiple impacts wreak havoc on the quad driver - shaking the bits loose (even when locked with the allen nuts!) and jamming the locking collar frequently. As far as driving bolts, you would be better off with a power tool or a good old ratchet. It's also pretty loud when the hammer gear kicks in (no big deal, unless you have been told to ""keep it down!"") Basically, I would have kept it if Makita had put a 3/8 or 1/2 inch keyless chuck on it but because of it's lack of versatility I went back to a driver drill."
5,Lartoolguy,"After reading the reviews on this impact driver I had to give it a try .Boy am I glad I did. I am building a 32x18 addition on my house.I dont think i've used my DeWalt or my other Makita drills very much since I bought this driver.After driving thousands of screws my conclusion is that there really isn't anything like this tool for driving screws in wall and floor sheeting and even drywall once you get used to it.The other reviews on this tool are all true.I cant believe I'm just finding out about it.Fast,powerful,light,and effortless.Its not cheap but if you have a use for it, its without a doubt worth every cent."
5,"longevity, longevity, longevity....","I install cabinets commercially for a living. We are not talking about a handful at a time, but rather, our jobs include hundreds of cabinets on each new job. Our entire crew use these exclusively and they get a workout day in and out. From 3-4 inch wood screws to self drilling metal screws this unit takes all we throw at it and comes back for more. My current gun has been in uses for about 2 years now and works just as well as new. My boss' gun has been in use for about 5 and he is just now replacing the bearings (bear in mind that this gun has seen 5 years of CONSTANT use; far more than the average man would use it in 10 years). None of use have any complaints. They are expensive, but if you drive screws for anything the return on investment will amaze you! I can't say enough good about this!"
1,Picture looks nothing like the product,My goodness this thing was CHEAP! The material was of the worst quality possible. The purple was nowhere near the nice lavender and royal purple that the picture shows. The product was just horrible and I would have been embarrassed to where it on Halloween. It had to be returned! Sadly there is a 20% restocking fee and you have to pay for your own return shipping. Not worth it at all!
5,Very easy to follow and fun,Very easy to follow without being too easy. A joy when you finally are dancing the celie dances along with the dancers on the video. A must for any one who is studying Irish Dancing solo.
5,A medical book that reads like a mystery,"In this extremely well written book, Luba Vihanski reviews one hundred years of research on spinal record regeneration. She describes the many angles from which this topic has been approached. She explains what was previously believed and what the experiments demonstrated. Many diagrams and photographs make the topic more clear. The researchers involved are not left out in the dark: You get a feeling that you know them.This account is illuminating and very easy to read, even for a neophyte like me without medical training. One piece of advice: read the appendix on the spinal cord before and after injury before you read the rest of the book."
4,great hat for cheap price,"It was a great hat for a great price. Already worn it once during cold weather. If it gets dirty, it's easily washed and they are cheap enough you can get the whole family one!"
2,A Comic Book?,"This is the comic version of The first Robot City novel. I am not against comic books, but this one is poor. The ""Data Bank"" in the back of the book was copied from the first Robot City book."
1,did not recieve product,"I ORDERED THE DVD, BUT NEVER RECIEVED IT, I GUESS THE MONEY I PAID FOR IT IS GONE. WILL NOT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE AGAIN."
4,Good for Challenges,"This book is good to challenge the priest to a higher way of living within the priesthood. However, it doesn't touch much on the nature of the priesthood itself. So if you're looking for sacramental theology - this isn't what you want. But if you're looking for a spiritual kick in the pants - this is exactly what you want."
2,Limited usefulness,The focus of this book on Glassian (d) and Hunter and Schmidt (r) approaches to meta-analysis really limits the usefulness of the book. Examples are limited to social sciences literature in which these approaches have been used. Do not buy if you want techniques publishable in other literatures.
4,wwII aircraft,"good historical material, just like first editon. narration is weak and film is not particularly accurate. directors not much experience in military."
5,Just great,"It's really hard to believe that this CD is an independent release. The production is superb, the musicianship outstanding and the songs are wonderful. After a nearly 5 year ""maternity leave"" Diane Zeigler has returned better than ever. ""These Are The Roots"" showcases her incredible voice and her songwriting expertise. Drawing from personal experiences and observations, the CD is a collection of heartfelt songs which will be right at home with your collection of big name folk singers. In a perfect world and with a bit of luck, Diane Zeigler would be as big a folk music name as there is."
4,Bursts some bubbles,"A very good work, this book discusses the Red Army officer corps from its inception to its disintegration. The author uses several sources to look at ""typical"" Soviet officers at different period of the Red Army's existence, including the Purge era, post WWII, etc. Changes in demographics, schooling and political influence are all discussed. First-hand accounts are used whenever possible.I found it especially interesting that Mr. Reese chose not to perpetuate the idea that ""the best and the brightest"" were eliminated during the Purge, paving the way for the disaster that the Red Army suffered when Germany attacked. As the author pointed out, bad officers must have also been eliminated, since the Purge seems to have been almost arbitrary.An excellent book but not a light read."
5,An Honest Look at our Heritage,These DVDs are very informative and are very enjoyable. I believe anyone who enjoys American History would enjoy this set. David Barton is an excellent historian.
4,What Dying People Want to Know,This was an excellent book. I genuinely appreciated how the author gave brief but understandable descriptions of different aspects of buddist life and belief so I could comprehend.I would recommend this book to anyone on a spiritual pathway who wants to understand how living is so important in the dying phase of life.
4,Readable and valuable,"As pointed out in a previous review, this is not a book with the most up-to-date research and theory on grief, loss, and dying. But then, if it were, it would lose its primary audience, ordinary people. If you have done a lot of work in this area then you may not find much new, though I think the book is still a refreshing read. But it is a book I could recommend for many patients and family members, as well as some caregivers who may not have had much education and experience with grieving people. As a physician, I doubt that the book is too ""basic"" for most colleagues who are not in high-mortality specialties."
5,Great PSP game!,This game surely uses most of the PSP's graphic capabilities. It is beautiful and I have alot of fun playing it. The Manager's mode is simple enough to be fun also and the other game modes are suprisingly fun too. The 2 things I have found that makes me want to throw my PSP across the room is that I have had the game crash twice in very critical moments of game play and the computer always seems to get the upperhand and I could swear it cheats?! I guess it could be me imagining things too. I would suggest this game to anyone.
4,It freezes but it's worth it,"Pros. Easy to play, cool side games, the training option is great, is very enjoyable.Cons. It freezes when you're changing too many options at the same time, some times the image goes black durin the game (rarely), you can play with less of 16 players, is not a big challenge."
2,Great... until it died,"I liked the toaster up until it gasped its last breath. It had great features like ""keep warm"". But it dies after only a year and a half of use. Too expensive (and big) to be disposable!"
3,"great style, not so great paint","This toaster oven is great. We've had it for over 2 years. It's stylish and fits 12"" frozen pizzas (which was a must). However, I'm upset that the paint on the dials has rubbed off. Now, if someone hadn't used it before, they wouldn't be sure how to turn the oven on or dial up the toaster setting!"
5,Best lipstick ever,"This is the best lipstick ever. I have been buying it for over 6 years. They do not sell it in stores anymore, only here on amazon. It stays on for hours and does not smudge. Outrageous 53 is a color that goes with almost everything."
5,Great book even for a Philadelphia area resident...,We live in the Suburbs of Philadelphia and we bought this book to make sure that we did not miss out on any of the amazing treasure in our own backyard... We have started with A and plan to go through the entire alphabet... I am hoping the next book in this series is ABC Softball. A must buy for any Philadelphia area resident or visitor... BTBJ.
1,A Disappointment,"This small pamphlet is a disappointment. I intended to use it as a record/checkoff for trips around the area with my grandchildren--I reside in the area. It badly needs updating. For example, D is for Philadelphia Duck, a ride which was banned from the Delaware this summer after a deadly accident. T is for a toy store in Chestnut Hill (must be a client of the ad agency that I guess created this ""book"")--it's a nice toy store, but there are several other as nice or nicer ones. The back cover is an ad for the same toy store. The layout is crowded with no room for decent location maps or additional information or personal notes."
1,Rip It,"I was a little disappointed in this particular publication. I love deconstructing and reconstructing and was attracted by that part of the subtitle. However, my interpretation of ""the clothes of your dreams"" and the authors are not the same! The reconstructed clothing is not something I would wear,and I am not around the clientele that would. I may have waited too late to return it, but I may still try, as I feel it is impractical and not something I will use."
2,Not a lot of useful information,"I think that the title is a bit misleading. There is some good general information about alterations, but the main thing that you learn from the book is how to alter clothes that are to large to make them fit better. That might be useful for someone who has lost a lot of weight or someone who buys over sized items at thrift stores for that purpose, but for the rest of us it isn't very helpful. The other alterations included outdated and just plain tacky stuff like adding fabric panels to a denim skirt or jeans to make them bell bottoms. I thought that it would have been better to include a way to alter flare leg jeans to make them more fitted. A lot of it may be my personal sense of style, but most of the actual projects weren't very stylish or they seemed like a lot of trouble for nothing. I say look at the pictures on the cover. It doesn't get better. If you are still curious, check it out at the library first."
1,Not great,Poor production and dull simple projects. No photos or coloured pictures. I've seen much better books along the same league.
4,Nice ideas,"Like a lot of reviewers already said, this book is mostly aimed at younger people and the DIY youth culture. But I was expecting that going in. It does cover the basics of sewing, and has some great ideas in it. I got it mostly for my 14 year old daughter, but there are some ideas in it I'll use as well like the cardigan conversions for sweaters.One of my biggest problems with a lot of reconstruction books is the fashions in them are not things I'm comfortable letting my daughter wear. This one is a lot more modest, and I appreciate that.A lot of the designs aren't really new, but very little is. It's a good collection of ideas. I think it's a good book for the 12-18 yo diy set."
5,RIP IT perfect inspiration,I bought this book for my daughter who loves it. She buys in thrift shops and remodels clothes to her own liking. This book is the best on this subject that I have come across. It has clear and concise directions and ideas. This book is great for the person who is concerned about the environment and utilizing things as best as possible as not to be wasteful!
3,Good For Begginers who are young teens,I think that this book is great for beginning sewers - - very young look.
1,Not worth it,"I was hoping to get some inspiration from this book on altering items I own but are slightly outdated or no longer fit. The types of projects included were pretty ugly and they type that were trendy for perhaps a week or two ten years ago, if at all."
3,Ok book if you don't need real pictures when sewing...,"There is really nothing bad about this book...there are some great ideas, understandable explanations, and up-to-date trendy styles for consideration. The only aspect that, in my opinion, would make it better is if the authors had gone with actual photos instead of grey and white illustrations (sometimes they look more like faint watermarks). I find that a picture really is worth a thousand words when it comes to sewing."
5,Great book to build your sewing techniques,I think that Rip It is great for anyone looking to learn more sewing techniques. Some of the great tips include the proper way to sew ribbon onto something and how to make a simple bustier. I loved this book because it is packed with some fun ideas.
2,ok but not as good as it seems,"First of all this book is OK for the beginner...The projects are simple and kind of outdated in my opinion...I had to give this a 2 to lower the overall rating a bit, normally i go by amazon feedback, as i did with that and was pretty disapointed.Just a warning cause if you are like me 4 1/2 stars is a big yes...this one not so much."
4,Live for DIY,I loved this book. I am a Miami native who thought this book ríase de costura. I really enjoyed it. I recommend it if you want to learn some nice techniques. muy divertido!
2,Misleading title,"I was disappointed in this book. There is some good basic information, but very little ""deconstruction"". A majority of the projects are merely adding decorations or embellishments to garments. Large print and a lot of white space on the pages make the book appear more substantial than what it actually contains. There are no pictures of actual examples, which would be helpful. Many of the projects are dated and uninspired. All-in-all, I am sorry I bought this book."
1,Sew Bad!,"Don't waste your time or money with this book! The ideas in this book are awful and outdated, and the results look extremely homemade. The few photos found inside were black and white and hard to make out (the only clear, color photos are on the covers), and the ""dream"" results for the projects were in illustration form. If you're looking for a decent dyi book, look somewhere else!"
4,Good Ideas for the Beginning Sewer,"If you aren't extremely familiar with pattern work or want to reconstruct some old clothing to practice sewing, this book is a good starting place. It has creative ideas including some that are relatively simple. I would not personally wear all the examples in the book but it was fun to practice on old clothes I was donating anyway.If you are an experienced sewer, or have already used similar books then this book probably won't work for you and will seem like a rehash.The book also serves as a great platform for coming up with your own deconstruction/reconstruction ideas. Once you are comfortable a few moderations to some of the suggestions makes it more personable and more wearable.I think it would help to have some basic experience using a sewing machine PRIOR to using this book."
3,Only so so,"I found the book to be far too simple. I am by no means a pro at sewing, but most of the ideas in this book were things I had already thought of on my own. The directions were a little too vague to make the clothing appear well tailored unless you already know what you're doing."
2,Way too basic,"This book isn't so much about refashioning your clothes so much as a basic sewing and fit lesson. I felt this book was WAY too basic for me. There really weren't any patterns and the pictures were pretty unimpressive. I was really disappointed with this book. If you are curious, get it from the library, but don't waste your money!"
2,learned one thing,"I was excited about this book, I checked it out from my local library, I was really not impressed. I have been sewing on and off for 3 years and I was looking for ideas to refresh the clothes in my closet. I live in Miami, the projects they suggested were way too basic and no way would I walk around miami wearing anything this book told me to do.The only thing I learned, or re-learned cuz I had forgotten was how to make your jeans shorter but keep the original hem line. So I'm really glad I didn't just buy this book."
5,Being There,"This story is an extremely life-like portrayal of a young teen boy experiencing new environments, friends, experiences and losing a father. It touches on dealing with school bullies and having a dippy mother to cope with. All of Yount's stories are extremely ""life-like."" This story reminds me of ""A Painted House,"" by John Grisham, but Yount's dialogues are more spontaneous than Grisham's. The proceedings of the story are also totally realistic: they proceed gradually and realistically, but they are not surprising."
2,A Big Disappointment!,"I've used and enjoyed many of Leslie's tapes. I particularly like the one-mile tapes as I've found them to be a great way to work in some exercise -- either early or later in the day. The main problem with this tape, which Leslie does unaccompanied by other pros or amateurs, (no weights are used either) is that:1) The ""music"" is really unpleasant; it is just fast noise. It really doesn't have a beat to which you can move naturally.2) There is no adequate warm-up or cool-down.3) The DVD is in a small fitted case, no bigger than the dvd, which makes it hard to store with other DVDs.If you're looking for a good quick workout, I'd recommend the following two from her Walk Away the Pounds series: 1) Power Mile; 2) Get Up and Get Started (I have this on DVD with the two-mile High Calorie Burn)."
1,2001 is better,"ugh. A new breed makes you qualify to race with cartoon jockeys, a cartoon horse mascot, and racing is A LOT more complicated. I love the 2001 gallop racer, I just don't think they improved on it at all, only complicated it more. What a shame. Rent it first before you buy it. Just my advice."
4,Great Game you'll wanna try it,"Gallop Racer 2003 is a really fun game. My friend has this game i love to play it. so i bought it for myself. You get to raise, train and race your horses. If you like horses you'll like this game! You are crazy if you don't buy it!"
3,don't buy it,"ok, this game was fun for a while, but it is so hard. I have raced 20,25,30 races and only won 1 of them. the stamina goes down so fast, that you can't even try the long races. you just can't win. the only fun part is training and breeding. I enjoyed that part. the rest was hard."
4,Vast Improvement over Gallop Racer 2001,"Gallop Racer 2003 has many new enhancements over its predecessor. Actually, it a totally new game. The reward system is much better as you earn both money and points. Money can be used for betting or improving facilities. Points are used for acquiring horses. Breeding horses actually takes a year from mating until a foal is born. You now have more control over your foals success because you can train them before and after they begin racing. Winning a race requires more understanding of your horses abilities and race conditions, it's no longer merely a case of beating the horse to death with the whip down the stretch. Game negatives for me are the limits on the number of horses you can hold for stud/breeding, a limit of 6 active horses for racing, and the Hall of Fame. Overall, the game has repeat playability as there are many hidden and locked features."
5,Excellent game!,This game improved on the previous Gallop Racer in many areas. You won't get bored in this one as you did in the other one. It is more difficult and challenging to ride the horses as well as their are many more races you can run in overseas. You can unlock many races as well. I highly recommend this game.
2,Nishika Flash,The flash worked as advertised. Only problem is I can't find a developer for the 3 D pictures. Two attempts to send it to the factory and the package was returned. No wonder the price was so low.
2,I could not get into it,"I love katharine Hepburn & Cary Grant but I did not like this movie. their con artist & Sylvia pretents to be a boy. She and her father flee from France because the police are after them & they meet Cary Grant who is also avoiding the police. I'm not saying it no good, I just didn't like the story line."
5,Ethereal Recording of French Composers,"I totally agree with the reviewer who states this cd is simply magic. It is an incredible 78 minute ride. The music is simply superb from start to finish. The cello and the piano are in perfect synchronicity. Each player, Mischa Maisky and Daria Hovora, bring a beauty and soul to the music that is simply undeniable.This is 78 minutes of musical bliss. If you enjoy music that relaxes and soothes the human spirit, this certainly will work. I give this cd my highest recommendation. This is one of those ""special"" recordings you'll play over and over simply because it takes you to a place you want to be everytime you listen to it."
4,Good product,"The mitt keeps the heat out although it gets a little tacky when picking up cast iron pots at 450*, and the stitching seems loose but has not parted. It may just have a bit of leeway. Fits comfortably and is a great value."
3,So-So,The toner didnt last that long as I had hoped maybe 800 pages and it started to get light on me
1,Samsung SCX 4100D3,"When I decided to buy this toner because I taught it is 100% new original from Samsung , but is not , it is a refill one.I hope for the future Amazon will put more product information, thanks"
4,Satisfied,The free toner cartridge included with the printer fails very soon. I ordered this one and so far so good. Much much better than the one comes with the printer.
4,Buy original manufacturer toner cartridges,"I bought a 3rd party cheaper toner cartridge and it didn't work. You're better off just buying the original manufacturer toner cartridge. Otherwise, you'll have the hassle of having to return, pay for return shipping, and lost time."
1,"Advertized XAA, -- XAA not delivered!!","I needed a real 4100D3/XAA toner cartridge. You advertised that this is what was going to delivered. See your advertisement!! What was really delivered was an ""4100D3/SEE"". Exactly as expected, this did not work in my printer, copier. The gear will not mesh properly and it pops up repeatedly. It was returned. Return process was fairly simple. No offer was made to actually deliver an XAA. NOTE: The existing cartridge (an ""XAA"") works perfectly."
4,A FINE TOOL,"This is a very well made tool and I do recommend it to anyone looking for a jig saw.It's low profile and barrel grip gets you down close to the work, for more control and cleaner cuts. The variable speed is a must and works well maintaining a constant speed at all settings. It comes with an anti splinter insert and a extra non marring base for delicate materials. The orbital action is a real time saver, letting you cut quickly when you need to. This tool will accept any blade so you dont have to waste your time looking everywhere for the right style, just pop it in and go. This is a solid well made tool that will last for years to come. Now get out there and jig something."
5,like a shot of whiskey,"the words in this book are crammed down the readers throat like a harsh shot of jack daniels. they come back up with the same vengence. sinister's work is superb, a must read for anyone who has ever questioned the worth of the human race. i love it and recommend it to all! enjoy!"
4,"As Usual, Gaither Delivers","I thought I'd write a review to correct the one star review previously given. Hymns is not as strong as its counterpart, Church in the Wildwood, but it certainly is worth having. The unique atmosphere of this recording (taking place at the chapel in ""The Cove"" - Billy Graham's retreat in North Carolina) is perfect for the type of project Bill Gaither has put together in Hymns. It is all old-timey gospel, the sort of bread and butter, feel-good, Sunday go to meetin' music that is the staple of popular gospel. Beyond that, Gaither combines a number of unique quartets with singers like George Younce, Larry Ford, Mike Allen, and Allison Durham Speer, all of whom deliver as usual. In short, if you're already a Gaither fan, it's a must have. If you are a casual fan looking for a recording to lift your spirits after a long day of work, this one is for you too. If nothing else, the recording is loaded with 19 tracks, and compared to most Southern Gospel CDs, that's a steal."
5,My Six Year Old Loves It,"But it's good for 5 to 10-year olds. It appeals to the hands-on kid, but doesn't speak down to them at all. Explains the concepts (fractions, averages, volume, graphs, measurements, etc.) clearly and quickly, then gives exercises and fun things for the kid to try. Mostly needs parent to be helping, though most are simple. We loved making a color spinner and folding paper (doubling). We charted doubling to show her what a parabola looked like. It has plenty of clear effective line sketches to illustrate. I found this at the library and decided to buy it."
4,Good stuff. Strong voice.,"Homes writes mostly about detached suburbanites. Her stories are extreme, often ridiculous. Her writing is sparse and strong, and her characters are typically flawed but likable. Among my favorites in this collection of short stories is one about two young parents who drop the kids off at grandma's and vacation at home together, during which they decide to experiment with smoking crack. There's also an interesting story about a young boy having an affair with his sister's Barbie, and my favorite--a story about a not disgruntled, but not exactly content lawyer who amuses himself by regularly urinating in the senior partner's potted plant. I don't think Homes is for everyone, but I think her stuff is smart, funny, and refreshing."
2,Sinister Suburbs,"I am thrilled that finally SOMEONE is writing about the boredom of suburban living. (As someone who was born, bored and raised in suburbs, I know of what I speak.) With that said, Homes is excellent at creating a mood, and with description. The problem is: the stories are pretty much similar: the suburbs are dark and sinister, and often times some adult or adolescent is having a breakdown, and more often than not some child, adolescent or adult gets naked. The best story by far is the first: ""Adults Alone"". This is a classic, and I give it 5 *. It shows the stark absurb behavior of a suburban couple whose kids are away, and the couple is so bored/lonely/at loose ends that they just keep getting more drugs and doing more bizarre things. If she had written more stories on this level, I would have given her entire book 5*! Unfortunately, Homes seems to be focused on such elucidating plots as an adolescent boy doing the nasty with his sister's Barbie doll. Sorry; I wasn't interested."
2,Did not keep my interest,"This book is strange. It didn't hold my interest. I had to force myself to read it. The stories go nowhere. Nothing ever happens. The similies drive you crazy, EVERYTHING is like something else. This book can really get annoying!"
1,bad literature,"It's nothing new to write about obscene senarios....it's been done to the point that even the most graphic, horrific, abuse is greeted with a voyeristic nonchalance....what's really sad is that not only is this subject matter still being plumbed, but now it's being done badly. A.M. Homes seriously needs the help of a good editor. If you want to read quality literature about suburban angst, try John Cheever....now he knew how to write!"
3,"Beautiful imagery, intensely psychological","I purchased this after watching the beautiful, artful movie adaptation of this collection of short stories. What surprised me most when reading ""The Safety of Objects"" was how the movie so deftly combined the stories into one coherent drama, using the haunting imagery and psychological trauma interwoven throughout what seems on the surface to be a very disparate group of stories. I liked this book, although I am not sure if I would have liked it quite as much had I not seen the movie beforehand? But, the book has its merits. It rips the roof off of the suburban houses & shows the disillusionment and pathos within, and in this regard, goes down well-worn paths, but the author provides provocative scenes & memorable, highly believable characters along the way."
4,Sarah's review of Safety of Objects,Wow! What an interesting and mind boggling book. A.M. Homes has a real knack for inviting us to see the world from a different perspective. I laughed and cried throughout this collection. She brings out the topics that we do not really talk about in public.I definately recommend this book. I think that the world needs to open up and use this as an inspiration to do so. Two thumbs up for this one!
2,interesting but anticlimatic,"This collection of short stories had a lot of interesting story-lines, but each were anti-climatic. The stories either just end with no resolution or never never come to a peak at all. I felt like I was starting a book in the middle and stopped reading it in the middle also. ""The End of Alice"", was much better."
2,Creepy,"This is a very well-written, very disturbing collection of short stories. Reading this book felt like finding a partially decomposed bird or squirrel on the fringes of a child's playground. The stories are dark. One of the cover reviews said they were witty; I didn't agree. Homes has tremendous talent. I was just repulsed by her characters.If you're into exploring the seedy underbelly of suburbia, this is the perfect book for you. If you'd rather be transported to a pleasant place when reading fiction, find something else."
4,Rural America like you've never read it before!,"This is not a typical book about a standard American suburban families! The characters in Safety in Objects are odd and disarming. The stories are dark, the language sharp and the dialogue is crisp. A.M. Homes has written tales that are bound to become cult classics. My favorite stories are ""Slumber Party,"" ""A Real Doll,"" ""Adults Alone,"" and ""Jim Train."" As said earlier, these are not stories about conventional families in rural America. These stories will make you think and perhaps even offend some readers. This is not for the faint at heart. Holmes is a fantastic writer and I look forward to reading more work by this author."
3,Like a Car Crash on the Side of the Road...,"I was compelled to read all of these stories all the way through. The same way I read ""The End of Alice"" or ""Asylum"" by Patrick McGrath, I was drawn in by the seemingly everyday subject matter, twisted to the point of it being unrecognizable. But, I couldn't help but be struck by the pure mediocrity of ""The Safety of Objects."" It seemed to me that these stories may have well be jotted down on cocktail napkins, not given much thought. AM Homes has, I think, a lot of talent, and it's too early in her career to use the same tired trick over and over, as she's done here."
5,A Beautifully Poetic Journal of an Americn Era,"With all the benefits and freedoms we reep from today's society, we often forget just how fortunate we are to have come so far. This book touches your heart and reminds you that we have come by way of struggle. It leaves you in awe of just how much those who journied before us have endured. Slave letters should be required reading in every classroom and every household in America. It is a journal of American history told through the eyes of those whose personal stories are not represented in our ""history"" books. Michal Connor is the vessel through which their poetry is experessed. It is beautiful!"
4,Bring on the G's!,"We have not had this machine very long and can't speak to reliability, hence only four *s. We have an 18th Century, four story farm house, four dogs, horses and stables outside. No ""deep pile"" carpets, but various orientals, bare wood, some tile, even linoleum. So far this machine has been awesome! The amount of dog hair, etc. dug out of carpets and sofas is amazing, even frightening. After two weeks the house smells and feels cleaner than it ever has. I am told that it is easy to carry up stairs and to store. One small downside is that it apparently can be damaged by hard, sharp things like paperclips. I tie fishing flies and it has picked up a very few hooks without complaint--but they were tiny. Fine machine so far!"
3,"Great for Dust, Not Good for Anything Else","I've owned this for 3 months now. The pros--it is excellent at picking up dust. I have a child who is extremely allergic to dust and I've tried many vaccuums--this is the best for dust--the suction is really fantastic. The cons-- it does a mediocre job at anything except dust (e.g. bits of paper, cereal,crumbs). It frequently jams and needs to be unjammed. The cord is too short and it is awkward to balance on a stair when cleaning the staircase. It doesn't roll or operate smoothly--it frequently gets tangled in its own cord.For my needs it works--the dust pickup is great. But unless you are hypersensitive to dust, this probably isn't worth the money or aggravation."
2,BULKY -- better off with an upwright,"I happen to own both the upright and canister vac. I purchased the latter item with the intent of using it for quick clean ups and for the stairs. UGH! This item is not only heavy, but very bulky as well. If I could turn back time, I would not have purchased this item. Save your money and get an upright -- Dyson has stellar uprights."
1,Not worth it if you are doing carpet!,"I just got home with my new vacuum. What a disappointment! I am returning it tomorrow. Although this machine is very cool looking, and easy to empty, albeit easy to make a mess if you hit the button too soon, the suction was horrible with the power head on. It works great with the smaller accessories, but there aren't enough brushes, and there is no pile adjustment for the power head. I had to go over several areas 4 and five times, and it still never picked up some visible paper on the rug. It worked fine on the hardwoods, but not at all on the carpet. Also, it doesn't even give you any vacuum lines that we all love. I am returning this tomorrow, and looking elsewhere."
4,Asome,Man the the guy that wrote the last reveiw doesn't even have the game this game is asome even if your not into slot carsthe game is the best
5,Midsomer Murders,Excellent selection that I gave my wife as a Christmas Present. She has always enjoyed Murder Mysteries and these are great.
5,Great Series,"I started watching this series years ago, and just thought it was a lot of fun. D.C.I. Barnaby and D.S. Troy are an amusing pair to watch. The set comes with a bonuse CD that shows where the stories originated, and interviews with the cast that I'd not seen before.I mainly bought this so my mom could see them.The newer ones are just as good, although there are a few clinkers like with any show, they held up throughout their long run. If you are a British Murder Mystery fan like me I suggest also checking out 'Inspector Lynley', 'The Last Detective', 'Poirot' with David Suchet, and especially 'Foyles War'. All excellent series."
1,No subtitles!,"Acorn Media NEVER puts subtitles on their DVDs! I think they included them on Set 12 only according to Amazon, but not Set 13 and 14. I wrote to them and they replied that it's an expensive process. Well, the DVDs aren't cheap either. I would not spend any money on this great series unless there are subtitles on them, because I miss out on a few things, and my mother, who also loves this series, has more trouble than I do. Acorn Media, put the subtitles on!"
1,Midsomer Murders: The Early Cases Collection,Midsomer Murders are wonderful. Acorn and Amazon are not! Do not be fooled by this packaging. You may already have these videos under other covers. Make sure you check before you buy and do not make the same expensive mistake I made.
2,Very disappointing performance of Dixit Dominus,"If the use of 'pedestrian' to describe a music performance is ever justified, this would be it. This is a horrible, horrible performance of Dixit Dominus - this piece demands a lot of the choir, but they don't even try to hit the right pitch. Handel would not appreciate this cacophony. I don't remember much of the remaining on the disc. I was too dismayed that I donated my copy to the school library."
3,Functional with Wear After 2 Years,"I bought these two years ago to replace Chinese made oven mits. They are made in the USA and that is important to me. This is my only set and I still use them and just started to notice spots of wear. I noticed because it is hotter on my hands and after looking closely, the material is rubbing off in the pressure points. They come in a longer version, which I also purchased but never use due to liking these better. I have had no issues otherwise. They wipe off easily."
4,Code Four Crossfire warm-up pants,"Great pair of warm-up pants. Previous reviews say they run long for the size specified and I would agree. I am 6 foot and the medium pants are a perfect fit for me. Other brands, I usually need a large to get the correct length. As for the quality of the warm-ups. They are great. Durable, and thick enough for most colder temperatures."
2,HO-HUMM!,"Too bad the sound engineers were asleep on this set. I pumped up the volume on this set which was recorded in DOLBY B, and found mediocre sound separation here. The audience applause/feedback sounds ""canned,"" and her stage antics were sometimes a bore. ""Warm Leatherette"" and ""Living My Life"" make the video."
1,NOT what i ordered,ZERO starsseller indicated the 2006 edition of this itemwhat i got was another older versionironically it costs more to return this than to just buy what i really needlesson learnt - Amazon isn't infallibleand be careful of what external sellers claim
3,This book is good for those who are really into management.,This book does it best to explain into detail the functions of management and what management is all about. The case studies also help student in the pratical work of how to manage an organisation.
1,So what?,"I decided to read this book because I am interested in relational dynamics. I made a mistake. This book is a personal diary of one little white straight woman. I left the book (which is written poorly in parts) with little useful or interesting information about the relationships between gay and straight people in general. I do, however, know WAY too much about the author now. I think this book could have been useful..the topic is interesting. This book is a perferct example of why academics should be discouraged from writing books ABOUT writing their dissertations."
5,A study of understanding,"This book is a compelling, thought provoking journey of a woman and husband into the lives of a culture unfamiliar to the author to try and bridge the gap of understanding between the two worlds. The author succesfully relays humor, emotional experiences,soul searching, and conversational analysis to get the reader to rethink his or her own compassion and communication with others. As a gay man, I walk away from Dr. Tillman-Healy's book inspired to reach out and be more sensitive to my fellow human beings. I recommend it to anyone who wants people to be more sensitve to them."
2,Crunchy,"With this salt, none of us like biting down on what feels like little bits of broken glass occasionally even if it is healthy minerals. The himalayan salt I bought at Swanson didn't do this and it was tasty. So I will be going back there next time. To each his own."
4,"Fine Sea Salt, with a Good Taste","Fine salt, mixes well. Can be used as a finishing salt, but a sea salt grinder would do you better. You'll love it if you know anything about salt and/or want to brag to your friends about where it comes from."
5,Great!,I am enjoying this product and it tastes great. I appreciate that it is finely granulated and can be used in a regular salt shaker. It is pink though and people may not realize that it is salt when they see it in a shaker. I would definitely buy this again.
4,"Good product, super super salty","I can't say whether or not these have any true health promoting effects (except for my skeletal issues I'm a healthy specimen), but I like the idea of using salt that comes from an ancient source and has micro nutrients in it, and I've used this in cooking.Big caution though, the product is MUCH saltier than regular salt, so be careful before you add it or sprinkle it on something!"
4,Salty salt...,"I heard that Himalayan Pink Sea Salt was spoken of highly so when I needed to buy some more salt I decided to try this. I have always used sea salt in a salt grinder. The main differences between regular sea salt and this product, I would say, are that this is a very finely ground product, and it seems to be the saltiest salt I have ever tried. I definitely have to be careful and not use a lot because a little goes a long way flavor wise. Also, even though it is a finely ground sea salt I still use it in my salt grinder and it works perfectly fine. Overall I would say that I do like this product and I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for something new to add a little more flavor to their food. Just remember, a little goes a long way!"
5,good value,I shopped at all the local stores and the cost for the salt was outragous. This is a great value and the quality is the same as what is in the store. shipping was fast.
5,good deal,"I love this salt. I fill my little shaker with more whenever i need. this salt is more saltier, so you can use a little less. this was a good price."
3,Illustrator's Bible,"This book offered some good tips for techniques of how to sketch. It also showed in several pictures and photographs some tips and techniques of how to use different medias.It discussed of different papers and sheets when sketching,drawing and painting.Some of the book was outdated like when it discussed of scanning and photographing because digital and other newer technology were not used as it is today. (This book was published in 1992).I would recommend this book for beginners who need tips and tricks of how to copy own drawings and how to do sketching. Also, when you are learning a new media, this book is good to have."
2,Expensive Consumables,I liked the performance of the razor but the consumables price make it a poor buy. Also the way the razor fits into the charging base is very awkward. The main problem with my razor is that the charging base only lasted two months and died. Without the charging base the razor is useless. Went online to find a charging base and could not find one.
4,Great Shaver,i got this as a present about 5 years ago very nice shave especially in the shower with Nivea shaving lotion packets.
4,"Not as close as a blade, but good","I have been using this shaver for about three months and I think it is a good product overall.Forget what Norelco says. I am a former Gillette MACH 3 user and this shaver will not shave as close as it the blade did. If you cannot stand anything less than a blade, this product is not for you.On other hand, one will face fewer cuts when compared to the old fashioned way, which is the actual reason why I kept it. In the long run, the skin gets a bit smoother also.I have tried using it with shaving creams other than those compatible with the unit, with no luck. My advice is to stick to the Norelco HQ170 Cool Skin Nivea for Men Lotion Replacement Cartridge. You will see far superior results.If you want to save some time every morning, avoid cuts, and have a shaver that works well in the shower, this product is an excellent option."
2,Not a good shave,"I tried this out after using Quadra and Reflex Norelcos for years. I'm not impressed. I don't get a very good shave, and my face feels irritated afterwards. It seems to take a long time to shave compared to the dry Norelcos. The trimmer is very inconvenient. And the shaver tends to deposit a hair/lotion (yuck) mix on my face towards the end of my shave.On the plus side, the cleaning system works well and the wet shave does keep hair from getting all over the place. However, I think I'm going to be trying out Norelco's money-back guarantee on this one and either going back to my Quadra or trying a Spectra."
3,Better than most but still not perfect,"I ordered this for my husband who has very sensitive skin. I thought that the lotion dispenser would be ideal for him. I have found out that he doesn't use that feature. When you push the button, the lotion just spits out in the one spot on the top and doesn't get distributed throughout the razor as you shave. Otherwise, the razor seems to be serving him well but, if you are intrigued by the lotion aspect, I would reconsider."
5,Best Razer I Ever Had,By far the best razer. Smooth. Easy to Use. I really like the lotion integrated with the razor. A great feature is the ability to just wash it out under the sink; much better than other razers that require cleaning with brushes. Battery life is not a problem; mine lasts for weeks before needing a recharge. I would definitely buy it again.
3,"Good Shaver, Bad Support","I like this machine, but getting spares for the lotion/gel is nigh on impossible unless you are willing to pay shipping to buy it on the net.I will go back to wet shaving when I run out of spares, $100+ bucks wasted."
2,Not impressed,If you have course facial hair as I do this will not work for you either. I find it takes just as long to use it as it does to shave with a razor and don't gat as clean of a shave.
5,"Easy to use, comfortable shave","I've used a number of other electric shavers, but this one is my favorite so far. Using it in the shower really helps take away the irritation of shaving. I also like the Nivea dispenser. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the replacement cartridges are expensive, but think they are worth it. I didn't find the dispensing button oddly placed or difficult to use. I can use it with one hand. It's easy to clean up too. You just pop the top open in the shower and rinse it out. I also haven't noticed an issue with the battery life. I travel a lot for my job and it lasts for the week trip. I don't even take the charger unless it is a longer trip."
3,Good but not Great,"I've used electric shavers for a long time now. Mainly because my face is too sensitive to shave with a blade. The Norelco 7735x gives a decent shave, but not one that you are going to get really close, especially if you want to do a ""dry"" shave. Using the gel or lotion really helps out. I found that the lotion works better. Shaving in the shower with the lotion gives the best results.The shaver is quieter than other shavers (especially the Braun), but seems to be much slower so shaving takes a good bit longer. The triple blades make it difficult to get under above your lip and I seem to have to get a disposible razor to get right under the nose. It did take about 2 weeks to get a fairly close shave. Overall, not a bad shave considering I paid about $35 for a reconditioned one. I wouldn't suggest shelling out more than that.Good: Price, Lotion Attachment, Noise, Size of Base (small)Not so Good: Closeness of shave, Hard to shave in small areas"
5,Highly recommended!,"PROS: close shave; less skin irritation and no cut; quick and easy cleaningCONS: long charging time; pricy cartridges; fragile looking bodyWith this shaver, I've had the closest shaves! It only took me several days for my face to get used to it. Blade razors, like Mach 3, give better shaves but they usually leave cuts on my face so this has been great. The shaving time is actually shortened for me because I just do it during the shower, and so easy to clean. Nevertheless, 8 hours are too long for charging- pricier 7775X model only takes 1 hour. Also the plastic body looks very fragile. Like others said, Nivea cartridges can run out fast. But I found a remedy- Nivea ""after shave balm"" 3.3 oz. at $4.79 in a local CVS pharmacy gives you the same quality as little five Nivea 0.4 oz. cartridges(total 2 oz.) at $5 do. I have a sensitive skin and Nivea sensitive ""after shave balm"" has been great. I hope this helps."
2,"Great shave, bad electronics","I got this as my first electric razor ever and fell in love with it! Smooth, comfortable good design. I all ways used it wet, and only seldom used it dry. It performed fantastic. Kooky beard/sidburns trimmer though. I never used it.After about a year and half the power button started acting up. I would have to push it about 3 or 4 times to get it to turn on or off. eventually it stopped all together. and wouldn't shut off so the battery would run out, i would re-charge it and mash the button 10-12 times to get it to turn on, then let the battery run out again.Drag. now i am shopping for a new razor, different brand."
1,"Good Shave, Bad Design","Pros:1. Good shave, after break in period. Not the best I've had for my skin/beard type. Several passes were needed for my beard which is course.Cons:1. Like other users' complaints about the hinge design, the flip up mechanism is highly fragile. I wish I sent it back to Norelco, instead I threw into the trash can I was so angry! Imagine yourself on a stressful business trip having to contend with this kind of junk!2. The Cool Skin additive is not worth it. Just buy yourself a beard cream from Jack Black or Kiehl's and get more for your money and better product. It's delivery system of the additive squirts near the blades, so you end up needing to spread it around with your shaver heads.3. The trimmer is a hassle to put on if you're looking for a speedy morning shave. Other brands/models have a flip up design, which I thought every shaver had.Good luck."
3,Only if you live in the shower.....,"I actually like this razor, but it does not give you a great shave. There are other razors on Amzn that are similar in price that would give you a much better shave. It is nice to use this in the shower, but, in reality, I very rarely use it in the shower. Mostly standing over the sink. So, I would prefer to have a better razor that may not be able to go in the shower."
4,Good,"provides really good shave at a reasonable price. Can't speak to it's longevity, yet. Give it 4 starts because of the poor packaging. Shaver was sealed in one of those molded plastic boxes which came apart when i tried opening it. No damage done but for the price i think they could come up with something more secure. Otherwise a great product.EDIT: Modifying my review as the shaver broke a long time ago. Dissappointing."
2,When the battery dies its over,After a year and a half of using this rather dull shaver... it dies on me... No way to replace the battery... you just get a new one.
3,So Far So Good,"It's a decent razor--it's great to be able to use an electic razor in the shower. I don't know what that one reviewer was talking about--you don't need two hands to dispence the lotion, nor do you have stop shaving to dispense. Just dispense as you go as needed--this is of course assuming you have opposable thumbs. The only problem, in my mind, is that the cord doesn't plug directly into the razor. Instead it plugs into a charging station. As another reviewer already stated, this isn't the most convenient design--yet another thing to lug with you when you travel. But worse, is that should the charge run out (and why didn't the engineers imagine that) you are stuck until it recharges. Had the plug gone directly to the razor, you'd still be able to shave--though probably not in the shower."
1,"Nonstick, NOT TRUE!",I love poached eggs so I finally bought the Chefmate poacher. It claims to be teflon nonstick but I painfully have to clean and scrub each little bowl after each use. I even have tried coating with oil and it still very hard to clean
3,should have bought it 43 yrs ago,I recently took the plunge to search for an egg poacher after 43 years of struggling to make decent looking poached eggs.I am more than happy with my purchase. It is easy to clean up and turns out beautiful eggs.It arrived VERY quickly also.
3,I prefer the manga way more than this.,Three stars tells you it's just an average movie. The manga series is better imo.
3,I prefer the manga way more than this.,"I don't own any of the ccs anime, but because I own all 12 comics, I know I will.This is for, but it's still pretty confusing. It makes you think there should be an episode for every card, but instead there isn't.First episode:The big card makes things big in Readington. And Nikki{Naoko in the sub} gets a weird book which turns out to be the create card.Second episode:Thanks to the change card, Li{syoran in the sub} and Kero swith bodies for a day.Third episode:Sakura's class goes ice-skating, But what about the freeze card, who is freezing things at the moment."
2,this is a GREAT tv seris thats been destored by Nelvana,Cardcaptors Sakura as well known in Japan is EXELLET!!!!!Cardcaptors as known in the USA and Canada is horrid!!!!! some reases why it stinks 1.they won't let Tomoyo sing she has to be a dumb valley girl.ARGGGGG!!!! 2.they make Sakura and Toya brats 3.Melings vioce is so bad it makes me flinch!!!!>:( 4.They sooooo don't give Tomoyo a peranalte(yeah i know i can't spell for beans hey i'm only 12!!!) 5.The slang they use need i say more? so if you wanna see something good get the subtitles if you want your ears to bleed from Melings's vioce get the dubbed you have been warned
4,A pretty decent wall mount,"I bought for my 42 inch LCD TV. It comes with all hardware necessary for different wall applications. Good instructions and strong frame. A great price for a quality mount. the only thing was it stuck out from the wall a little more than I would have liked, but other than that it works great."
3,Not for 32 in,"We bought this to hang our 32"" in our bedroom and this says its for 32-60 inches and it isn't the mount sticks out on either side of the tv. It was just too big. However, we didn't return it because we are gonna hang our 42 in and the mount is great just not for a 32 inch tv."
1,I will never buy from seller or Amazon again.,I will never buy from seller or Amazon again. Amazon has become too large and they and their sellers make false judgement against others.
3,Fun at first...repetitive towards the end.,"The game is a good solid game, dont get me wrong! It runs good, good graphics and impressive music. The cars are cool and the controls are easy. But I was dissapointed when there was no drifting(like in the PS2 and XBOX 360 games). The game is very fun at first, but then all the tracks start to look the same and they all have the same basic idea, Come in first, or start over. The game also gets really hard, and the last two territories almost seem impossible to beat. Good game....but the end is very hard and seems repetitive. So would I buy it again? Yes. Is it as good as the Main Consoles versions? No."
5,One of the best in the series so far!!!,"This is the only Need For Speed game for my PSP, and it sure rocks!! Here is a list of my NFS games from earliest to latest: NFS 3: Hot Pursuit (PC), NFS Porsche Unleashed (PC, GBA), NFS Hot Pursuit 2 (PC), NFS Underground (PC, GBA), NFS Underground 2 (GBA), NFS Most Wanted (GBA), this product (NFS Carbon OTC (PSP), NFS Prostreet (DS), and NFS Undercover (DS). This has got to be one of, if not my favorite.My Ratings:Detail: 12/10, Graphics: 13/10, Fun: 9.5/10, Overall: 11.4/10.This game is awesome for anyone who has a PSP with ver. 2.71 or later (won't play if you have ver. 2.70 or earlier). Please buy it! You'll love it!!!"
4,BOOK MONSTER,"I HAVE BEEN USING THIS SHAMPOO FOR ABOUT 4 YEARS. I HAVE THIN, FINE HAIR AND HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME FINDING A SHAMPOO THAT WOULD GIVE MY HAIR A LITTLE BODY. THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN THE BEST SO FAR. EVERY TIME I TRY SOMETHING ELSE I REGRET IT."
1,Nexxus Vita Tress,"I order the Nexxus Vita Tress pictured here, the older product. That is not what I recieved. The newer Vita Tress does not work as well and I was very disappointed with this product. Should not picture one product and ship something else."
3,For Ffffff...flytrap's Sake!,"Having read so many other reviews, all I can say is ""Sit back and enjoy the ride."" This is enjoyable camp to say the least, including a wonderful ""Woe is me"" performance from Tom Baker, later to bring Doctor Who to the cult status it enjoys now. (Rightly so but that's another story).This is essential viewing if not buying. Choose one but I bet you'll take the other too.Enjoy!"
5,Excellent introductory book,"For anyone who's hungry to get quantum mechanics demystified, to understand the actual problems without a condescending ""popular science"" author weaving weird metaphors, this is *the* book. --Viresh Ratnakar"
1,Extremely confusing,"I was very confused by this book. Although I have a B.S. degree in physics (I really do) I could not follow the points the author was apparently trying to make. It's not just the math that's difficult to understand, the non-mathematical explanations are also very confusing. I read over some sections three or four times attempting to grasp the logic the author was using, but ended up just giving up. I was looking for a deeper understanding of quantum mechanics but I really didn't get anything out of this book at all."
3,Pretty Decent Movie For 1994,"This movie, The Paper Boy, was pretty decent for the year 1994. The picture and acting quality could have been improved but still pretty good. The twelve year old held his own and could have gone far, but through my search he really hasn't done much since this role - which is a shame - the older women who they called 'The Witch"" her acting was great. This was a great. The daughter was really good in her role. The mother was okay in her role too. I think you'd be better off watching this movie for the $2.99 because it's worth it, but please don't purchase it."
2,The Paperboy,It was shallow and boring. It was kind of silly and unbelievable. I would not have rented it if I knew it was going to be so dull.
5,"Great Movie, but would only work in my Blu Ray player","My 5 stars are for the movie itself. I waited a long time for a widescreen DVD release of Tobruk. It is among my favorites in the WWII genre.However, the disc I received would not play on any of my DVD players. I tried playing it on three different models from Sony, Pioneer and one from Toshiba. The disc would attempt to load then just quit. It would finally play in my Sony Blu Ray player and it played flawless. Odd that it took a blu ray player to get it to play when it is not a blu ray disc.Update: I just ordered a second disc from Amazon. This one played played flawlessly in my DVD player. I'll hold on to my original copy take it to my vacation home since it will still play ok, though only on blu ray players"
4,Tobruk,Glad it was finally released on DVD. No gripes with either picture quality/audio.Put it in and it plays. Das ist gut!
4,spectacular war story,It may seem a little like a Boy's Own adventure but this movie is exciting and spectacular. Rock Hudson leads a group determined to destroy Rommel's fuel dumps. Presented in proper wide-screen format.
4,Tobruk,"Tobruk is an excellent WWII action picture that takes the viewer on an exciting trip across 800 miles of hot,burning desert with the British commandos. The Germans and the Italians are outclassed along the way. Their attempt to destroy the fuel bunkers at Tobruk (to stop Rommel's advance against the allies) is the finale of an ""on-the-edge-of-your-seat"" war flick well worth seeing and owning."
4,"Great workout, no ab belt","I've used Leslie's 3 mile for years and bought the 5 mile for a little more challenge, which it is. I love the workout and would have rated the dvd a 5 star except for the difficulty getting an ab belt. It does not come with the dvd as I thought it would, and cannot be ordered separately.I ended up buying an additional Leslie dvd, just to get an ab belt, but I don't use that dvd because it isn't challenging enough."
4,Great video,I really like this video. However I was a little disappointed because it's not too much different from the other video of L. Sansone's that I already had. I like the fact that it is 45 minutes instead of 30 and the speed/impact is faster or more intense.
4,Very good workout!,"I love Leslie Sansone and have many of her videos. This is one of my favorites because it's longer, a bit more challenging, and you can use it to create different combinations of workouts. I have been using most days of the week for the past several weeks, and I have yet to get bored with it. However, at times, I do turn off the volume, put on my own favorite music, and simply follow the picture."
5,Walk - come on Leslie it is a walk/jog!,"I am a fan of Leslie's - this is a very nice compliment to her 4 mile walk. If you are a beginner or someone who does not want to ""jog"" or ""run"" she has a person you can follow and still work up a good sweat. I like the fact she gets winded in this work out and even kids - that's enough aren't we done yet! I can relate to that - but she bounces right back with we can do it! LOL hey it works for me!"
5,A Fantastic Low Impact Video,"I love this DVD. I am a walker and bought this DVD for days I can't go outside or to the gym. At first I thought the DVD was too easy because I regularly walk 4 miles several times per week and my first two 5 mile walks didn't seem to impact me much. But, when I tried it again, it tire me out a great deal because I used more effort with my stepping, kicking and jogging (you'll see what I'm talking about if you haven't tried the DVD yet).It's very low impact if you want it to be OR high impact if you want it to be. It's all up to you."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"I'm a die-hard Walk Away the Pounds fan! I have exhausted my 3 mile VHS tapes, I decided to order this 5 mile DVD and was totally bored. It did not keep my attention as the previous ones had."
4,Great workout!,"I like being able to choose different workouts on one DVD. While the steps are basically the same, it is not boring. One of the best features is the ability to choose music only during the workout. I enjoy most of Leslie's workouts but on this DVD in particular she tends to be very preachy and repetetive in her comments. Once you have the idea it is easy to follow along aithout vocal instruction."
5,Love this,"I love this video. It helps me to stay motivated and get my exercise in! Leslie is awesome to work out with, very encouraging, indeed!"
4,good workout,"I like the workout, but I need a cool down walk to get my heart rate back down. This dvd does not really offer that, so I either do it on my own after the whole workout (pause the dvd before I stretch) or just make my movements slower and not use the band the last 5 minutes of the last mile. All in all a great workout, but I would like it better if there was a 'cool down walk'."
2,not as challenging,"This was my first walking dvd. I did the entire exercise, used 3 lb. hand weights during the boosted portions, and didn't feel challenged. I've since purchased 5 Fat Burning Miles, Walk Slim 4 Really Big Miles, and Walk Slim 4 Fast Miles with both of the 4 miles dvd's being my favorites. These videos are fast paced throughout unlike the 5 Mile Walk."
3,It's OK - but not the best,"I was very excited to get this video when it first came out. I have about eight other workout videos by Leslie and use them six days a week. I was not very impressed with the 5 mile walk. I thought there was just too much walking in place or walking forwards and back - not alot of variation like on her other videos. I found myself starting to improvise and put different moves into the workout to get a little more variation (such as kickbacks, kicks, knee lifts)... I really like the Walk Away The Pounds Express videos or the Walk Away The Pounds For Abs. As others have said, this video does have a different feel to it and it's not what I've come to expect from her previous workouts. She does give the option of turning off her voice and just listening to the music while working out. That's a nice option for those who get annoyed with all the talking - that has never been an issue for me. All in all, this video is OK, but the others I mentioned above are better."
4,Leslie Sansone 5-Mile Walk with Stretch Band,"I think this video is great. I have several of Ms. Sansone's videos and like to alternate them for variety. This is my newest addition, so it is still fresh, but the miles go so fast. I sometimes get tired of all the talk but it's better than with no talk at all-which is an option on this one. I took one point off of my review because I exercise early in the morning so keep the volume as low as possible and I cannot hear the music! I have to be able to hear the music to keep the pace but when I turn it up the talking is too loud. This video would serve me better if the music and talk were at about the same level. Otherwise, TERRIFIC!"
3,Trying to like this one,"I am trying to like this Video because I really love Leslie Sansone.The set and the particpants look very crowded. They don't seem to have a lot of room. This is not usually a factor for me, because I have plenty of room in my apartment. However visually it is turn off to me."
3,Mile Markers Promised But Not Delivered,"I have many Leslie Sansone DVD's and enjoy them, even if they are basically the same. This one, though, does not, despite what the cover says, have mile markers that let you choose. You can only choose the ""packages"" of 3 or 5 mile walks. That wouldn't be so bad if the cover explained what is in each walk, but it doesn't. You have to listen to Leslie's intro at the beginning and take notes. You would think the convention would be clear by now: give us a menu that tells us how long the mile is, what aids it uses, and let us choose each mile individually. Are you listening, Walk at Home?"
4,Glad Leslie came out with more challenging video,I have been a fan of Leslie for years and have to admit I was becoming bored with her workouts. I researched for a more challenging dvds and read the reviews on Amazon.com before making my final decision. I read the ones on this dvd several times but was kind of hesitant about purchasing it. I read the reviews and hoped it was advanced and challenging like everyone was commenting. I got the dvd in and tried it out with my sister. We fell in love with it instantly. It stars you out at a faster pace and gets your heart rate up there....real quick so you can burn that stored fat. My sister and I are still working on losing weight and can tell a difference just in a few short weeks. We won't step on the scale yet but we do notice a difference. Thank you Leslie for coming out with a more challenging dvd.
3,misleading,Was under the impression that this dvd would be more challenging. I have been doing Leslie's walk programs for quite sometime now and am looking for a more vigorous workout.
2,not the original or a poorly made remake,"Most of the songs on this album, if not all, are not what you may be used to hearing. They are not bad but they do not sound like the originals at all except maybe technically. Try one and see."
4,Restorative,"I read this book for a class and I must say if it was not for the class I might not have read it, but I am happy I did I enjoyed the book."
1,Poor Quality,Not nearly as substantial as pictured. Check out the collars at Allegro Medical Supplies website instead.
4,Great product,I find Duro Med Foam Collar to be very helpful in easing neck pain caused by various things. It is comfortable and true to size.
3,"Duro-Med 4"" Firm Foam Cervical Collar",I wear mine 23.5/24 hours a day 7 days a week. The most severe test of durability.It is falling apart after one year of use. Not sure if that is a positive or negative reflection on product. For use under one year that would be a positive.
3,"More technique, less pattern","This book is just ok, not very good resource for those who are looking for patterns & designs. Many pages are useless & some technique seem not easy to follow because using fingers to roll the strips. After going through the book a few times i don't feel like to start any project in the book."
2,Quilling Techniques and Inspirations,"This book was just OK. Some of the pictured projects did not have instructions on how to make them. Many of the projects have quilling which is quite large, which I dont think looks as nice as small, dainty quilling."
5,Extremely inspirational!,"As a beginner, this book will ensure I'm not a beginner for long! What wonderful illustrations and instructions! I had no idea there were this many techniques and styles. It's nice to know there really is no limit to what one can create with a little knowledge and a lot of imagination. Highly recommended."
4,I Love Quilling Techniques and Inspiration,"This book by Jane Jenkins is wonderful. Some might call it the next level. I think of it as a new dimension. Her style is open, bold, and modern. The quilling is lovely to look at. I found instructions for several techniques that were new to me. I've enjoyed working them into my latest projects. This isn't a pattern book (although there are a few). It really is a technique and inspiration book."
3,It's ok,"This was my first quilling book.....it shouldn't have been. In my opinion, it is for more experienced quillers, not beginners. I now own several other books that have taught me step by step how to quill less complicated designs and designs that I prefer. Her artwork is VERY beautiful, but I'm a simple gal who just wants to quill small projects like cards or small crafts. It's a great book for showing you how lovely an art quilling is, but is not as practical as others that I own. It's a wonderful part of my crafting library, but not the one I pull out first. If you are just starting out, you might want to look at others first."
4,Nice little bunch of songs,This was the first Mamas & Papas stuff I ever owned and it was released LONG before 1995!!Its a nice set of tunes and I had the cassette which I found in the cheap bin in a store and took it home and liked it very much.I was a happy kiddo. And the sound quality is just fine. These songs were probably taken straight from the original cuts. Which I prefer. Most people dont realize the down side to digital remasters. But anyway....this is a nice album. Just a dinky little compilation that is fun.
3,For $5 bucks I got what I wanted! Cheap nostalgia...,"This low budget comp of ten songs includes two of the turmoil stricken group's hits that launched them into fame. ""California Dreamin""(1965) and ""Monday, Monday""(1966) are the essence of ""The Mamas and The Papas"".Though the sound varies on most of the selections, these two tracks sound fine. My advice is to cut down on the audio treble for the best sound. There are fine covers of ""Spanish Harlem"" and ""My Girl"". A few songs highlight Cass Elliot's voice, who went on to have a successful solo career before her untimely death. Checking out Wikipedia for the groups biography I noticed quite a bit of coverage on their out of studio antics. With only five albums to their credit, this disc gives us a sampling for those who don't, or want to pursue more. No annotation or personnel listings of any kind is included."
4,Track Listing:,1. God is So Good (To Me) - Mahalia Jackson2. Faded Rose - Shirley Caesar3. Changed - Tramaine Hawkins4. Never Grow Old - Aretha Franklin5. We Shall Behold Him - Vickie Winans6. Great Things - Tessie Hill7. At the Gate - Edna Gallmon Cooke8. Packin' Up/Surely God Is Able - Marion Williams9. Stand by Me - Inez Andrews10. You Must Be Born Again - Dorothy Love Coates11.

3,Invent a religion,"The author says we invented religion because we cannot deal with reality. Not exactly a new idea. He ends up saying we should invent it again, but this time make it more rational. Sure! His approach is psychoanalytical, his writing is too verbose. Read it, but don't buy it."
1,Video and Audio Out of Sync,"Save yourself time and aggravation and DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! I bought this to put home movies on DVD. Almost every time I downloaded a home movie to my computer the audio was not in sync with the video. I spent hours trying to get it right. I also kept upgrading my computer thinking that was the problem. I finally saw a review here explaining that the PX-M402U is notorious for this problem, so I bought a CANOPUS ADVC110 and have not had a single problem!"
3,No Vista,"I e-mailed Plextor a couple of weeks ago trying to find out if this unit will work with VISTA. They just told me NO, and suggested their PX-AV200U. I was looking forward to a more higher end DVC from them since I own several of their DVD drives for my computers. :-( Guess I will shop around...Terry, Hayward, CA"
3,Good for the price I guess.,"This unit works quite well, except for a small line it leaves at the bottom of all my captured videos. It's a bit annoying, but otherwise, this unit works great. It is extremely easy to install and use."
3,"Great hardware, Software leaves lots to be desired","The PX-M402U is great. As with all Plextor hardware I've used, I would purchase it again. The InterVideo WinDVD software for capture I thought was poor, and often didn't work well. It lacked good instruction, and when I went to their site to see if there was an update, all I got was an offer to purchase another more expensive package. I purchased this to product transfer VHS home video to DVD, and I was able to do that. Unfortunately, you have to use the InterVideo software to capture, but I was told by a Plextor rep. that you can use another software package to compile and burn. Plextor needs better software to make this product a success."
1,A complete waste of time and money.,"Absolutely could not get this device to work properly. Halfway through a recording the software froze and forced reboot to recover. Did this on both analog and digital source files. Interesting nowhere in the manual or on the website was there anything about ""trouble shooting"". No weekend support so back it goes."
3,its waay better than the ADS instant DVD + DV,"although they both come with feature reduced software...yes they'd like you to spend more money,,,Nero is better 'so far', !Fewer! coasters...Apply the updates on everything, takes five min. saves hours!You can use gifs and jpegs for backgroundsmake your own layouts...I ordered the ADS instant DVD+DV so I could makedvd's of my 6 month old,,,you can fry an egg on it,,, I dremel'd a matrix ofholes in the case,,, its cooler but still too hot...hate your convert-x,,, I'll trade ya my ADS instant DVD+DV!!!"
2,Never Worked,"I bought this to use as a capture device for my laptop, and I never got it to work at all. I used several different computers and installed the drivers and software several times only to be frustrated every time.The device really urges you to use the software that comes with it, but I would prefer using my own version ofAdobe Premiere Pro CS3. Of course the Plextor would not work with either its own software or mine.Since I had purchased it a while back and hadn't gotten around to using it for some time, I didn't bother to return it, so I can't comment on the customer service of Plextor."
1,Promising...but no go,"I was amazed when I took this unit out of the box and saw that it was made in Japan, not in China. I was expecting a smooth ride with a quality piece of hardware. I installed the drivers, then plugged in the unit. Everything came right up, except for sound. I checked all my connections, played with volume, and then noticed that my laptop's sound was completely non-functional, not just the sound from the Plextor. Rebooting didn't solve the problem. I had to roll back to a restore point to get my sound back. I tried once again, this time using the drivers downloaded from Plextor's web site, which were newer than those on the included CD. Everything came up perfectly, including sound. I played for about 15 minutes, and then my notebook's sound was gone again.I emailed tech support; their response (after four days) was to reinstall the drivers. Gee, thanks. I was very disappointed to have to pack it up and return it to Amazon."
1,Plextor tech support disclaims compatibility,"I had great expectations for this product, but am highly disappointed. After creating a few test videos which would not play, I contacted Tech Support. I was quite surprised they did not guarantee MPEG output compatibility with any software except the WinDVD player that came with the unit.It's hitting the trash can...."
1,Tech Support Does Not Reply,Product does not work with Windows Vista. Tech support will not reply to my requests for help to see if there are plans for updated drivers/software. Need to return product.
5,Does God Really Play Golf?!?,"Mulligans and mercy, fairways and faith...Many men would claim that golf is their religion. David Curry will show you that golf really is a great example of God's plan of salvation. With fascinating parallels and humerous stories from this not-so-hot golfer, this book is a great tool for finding God or sharing him with friends. Whether stuck in a sand trap or playing the fairways of life, you can always use some help from a pro. This book doesn't promise to improve your swing, but it will help you win the game of life."
4,"Great music, great players","I'm skeptical of this sort of thing - we've seen thousands of Beatles collections done every imaginable way - but this is really well done. The players are excellent musicians but stay close to the source material, bringing the pieces a new life rather than just using them as jumping off points for extended improvisations. Yeah, it's a little safe, but very polished and perfectly executed. I think any jazz or Beatles fan would find much to like here."
5,"REALLY GOOD THINGS, LIFE ENDURING, ARE NOT",FOR FREE !And this is the book that can make A GO OF YOUR MARRIAGE!Nobody as grateful as a motivated husband... and it's so easy to make your man and yourself sooo happy. And you'll reap the great benefits of his financial success!
4,Another Great Orphan Train Story,"Stories about the Orphan Train fascinate me, and this one is well done. Al Lacy shows the plight of children in New York, along with the solutions (and problems) created by the Orphan Train. As a reader, I wanted brothers and sister, Jarod, Nathan, and Susan, to find a home together. Breanna Baylor's care for the children, both physically and spiritually, is touching and admirable. I was pleased when the story merged with another in the series, telling me more about the lives of favorite characters from previous books. I'm happy to recommend Book 5 in the Angel of Mercy series."
1,"Poor quality, shipped damage","I do not recommend this item. When I received this frame, it was cracked in one corner. The paint job on the frame was poorly done as well; no attention to detail, it looks like a 1st grader painted the gold highlights with paint splashed carelessly on the frame when it was meant only for the molded highlights. Not nearly as nice as it appears in the picture. I was fooled. Save your money and look for something with higher quality if you are planning to frame something nice."
3,Witness for the Defence moved very quickly as it told a story containing...,Containing assumptions of the characters and of the reader both. It's a fast and enjoyable light reading for the holiday season.
2,Not a book for me,This was not a book I would recommend. I did not like the century it took place nor the characters. I could not get into it..
1,Beware! Worthless!,"Do not buy, unless you want to use it for a very short time. The battery is built in, cannot be changed, and is not warranteed. Also, the unit will not run on the charger. When the battery fails (which will be soon), the unit is worthless."
2,Designed to be Disposable,"This unit seems ok at first, if a bit underpowered compared to similar battery operated trimmers. Even when fully charged, the blades move too slowly, and it doesn't do an effective job of trimming. With the blade guard removed, it is so bulky that it can't easily be used to trim in tight spots around the nose or ears.The unit uses NiCd cell which is sealed within the housing. NiCd, or the Nickel Cadmium cell, has among the lowest life of rechargeable batteries, and the worst recharge characteristics for infrequent use. A 3 year life for this product is either luck or fiction; this trimmer may die sooner than you may expect. My Norelco T770 died after about a year and a half.Once the cell loses its ability to take a charge, you can toss it. There is no cost-effective or easy way to replace the cell inside the unit.Bottom line: don't waste your money. Buy a trimmer that can cut, and is not meant to be disposable."
3,Pretty good but too noisy,I think it's a good product but they should improve the noise it makes. I have to use it every day morning and I wake up the whole entire neighborhood.
4,Good trimmer for your money,"I replace my old no frills Norelco with this new vacuum trimmer, and it works pretty much as advertised. Some hair invariably misses the suction and lands in the sink, but no more hair all over the counter. The guide works preety well, although you do have to go over your beard a number of times to get everything (it could do a little better job combing the hair up for cutting). All in all a good buy."
2,A short-lived device with an obsolete rechargeable battery,"I've had this Norelco for about 2 years. It is now close to dead because it will not hold a charge beyond a single use. Since the battery on this and other Norelco's cannot be replaced, it is essentially a minimally useful product. It does cut well, thought the height adjuster band can easily slip from a 5 to a 2 -- a disaster if it happens to you in mid-cut. One would expect that by this time, after all Norelco's experience, they'd have worked the battery bugs out and provide at least an optional power cord when the battery finally gives up the ghost. This my second such Norelco, and my last until they either allow replaceable batteries or a power cord and a better rechargeable battery."
4,Great Beard Mower,"This is a nice product, dependable and durable. The vacuum feature keeps the sink area tidy, good for haircut touch ups in between real haircuts too. Norelco T-770 AccuVac Beard & Moustache Trimmer T770"
1,Limited battery life makes it a BAD buy,I have bought T7500 which had bad battery and then T770 which also died after about a year. I have tooth brushes that last years. For some reason norelco batteries have very limited life.AVOID buying this.
2,"The ""accu-vac"" is not so ""accu""",I'm not sure what kind of facial hair the men have who claim a 90% vacuum rate. I'd guess about half of my hair makes it into the vacuum tray. The only problem is that it's no less annoying to clean 50% of my beard hair out of the sink and surrounding areas than it was to clean 100% of it.Don't expect much in the way of vacuuming from this product.
4,Surprise,"Surprisingly, this product is fairly good for the price! I bought it strictly for trimming my neck, of course without the comb, and for that, its barely passable in getting all of the hair, but it pretty much vacuums all of what it does get. For facial hair, I imagine it would work very well."
2,"Search Google ""Norelco T770 battery"" before buying...","Not much more to say. Nice trimmer but. The battery loses it's ability to hold a charge after a year or so. Norelco provides no solution. In case you're saying to yourself ""I'll use it plugged in."" Think again. It does not work at all when it's plugged into a outlet. That's only for charging as long as the battery lasts."
5,Challenges our fundamental understanding of Wealth!,One of the best books I have ever read on how to alleviate scarcity and lack in my thinking process and how to truly embrace prosperity and actually achieve it. My life has totally turned around since I started applying the principles in this book! I highly recommend it!
4,Needed extra,I have the warmies wipe warmer (for cloth wipes) and I don't believe these pillows last 3 months. I've had mine approximately one month and it's already discoloration and getting an odor. No big deal since I LOVE warm wipes and I think my daughters bum does too :)
5,Great product,Great product. Could not find in any local stores. Internet is becoming my first place to shop for many items.
2,warmer works fine without them,"I had been using these with my cloth wipes in the Premium Wipes Warmer and was tired of them drying out too quickly and having kind of a funky smell. The package says they should be replaced every 3 months, but I found they really only last a little over 1 month. I was getting ready to buy my second set of replacement pillows when I decided to try using the warmer without them. So far I don't notice much difference! The cloth wipe closest to the bottom did dry out a bit, but it was still usable. I think I will deal with a dried out wipe every once and while and save the $7 or $8 to replace the pillows every month."
4,It depends on the wipes,"I like these, I think they work good, but I noticed that it depended on the wipe how well they work. Whenever I use Huggie wipes they dry out and the warmer doesn't work as well. The Huggie wipes absorb all of the moisture, I literally could wring them out and use the water to wet the pad again they soaked up that much and that was with only 5 wipes. I have found that with the Walmart Parents Choice wipes that I did not encounter this problem."
4,Keeps wipes from drying out,"I've been using the prince lionheart warmer for 2 years, and I've replaced these pads about every 6 months. I soak the pad in water at least once a week and that has seemed to make it last pretty long. The pad does get brown on the bottom side almost immediately, and I have not found a way to prevent that, but it has never developed a bad smell, and all the wipes stay warm and perfectly damp down to the last one. I am using disposable wipes, and I personally wouldn't put them in the warmer without the pad."
5,Baby Wipe Warmer Pillows,"My baby likes warm wipes, especially in winter and during the night. She can be changed and come back to sleep in a sec. Those pillows are very good, they keep wipes fresh, clean and warm. I just wash the pillow with water and let it wet once a week, as per instructions. My wipe warmer got broken after a few days, and Prince Lionheart staff immediately sent to me a new one which is working properly.Good items and good customer service!"
5,does the job,"Like these replacement pads, you do need to follow directions and make sure to keep these pads moist at all time of the heat from your warmer will dry it out. Now depending on babies age and how many changes you are doing per week anyway you will notice when it starts to get dry, I would take it out and do a quick rinse just to keep it fresh, especially if you are doing cloth wipes as well. Otherwise it does the job.. :) Wish they were a little bit more reasonably priced since you are buying two at a time, but still not too bad.."
2,Not honest -,"Well.. As my title suggest .. They don't last nearly as long as the manufacturer suggest.I've had to replace this pad for my wipes warmer AT LEAST every thirty days.And even then, the pad is usually BONE DRY before then with brown spots all over it the pad). Which forces me to throw away wipes that are near to the pad/bottom although the wipes haven't nearest the dried pad don't simultaneously dry out, who wants to use brown wipes for their precious lo's bottom?)The warmer itself does it's job, but these pads need a bit of tweaking! Expect to change the pad every 3-4 weeks , NOT as the manufacturer suggest!"
3,dries out too quickly,"I like the concept, and they do keep my cloth wipes warm and damp, but these little pads dry out way and burn too quickly. I have had these dry out and start to burn while there are still wet wipes on top of it. It made the whole nursery smell like burning soap. I don't like that I have to keep replacing these so often--especially b/c the local store where I bought the warmer has stopped selling this brand."
4,Good warmer but has some issues,I love the wipe warmer but it has some issues. The pillows frequently stick to the bottom of the warmer and leave brown stains and decolorations... Other than that I really like the pillows and the warmer
5,Good product at a good price...,The Prince Lionheart Ever-Fresh Replacement Pillows are great way to keep your baby's wipes warm and clean.
2,Are these even necessary?,"I have rinsed these every week like it says, but they still start to dry up and turn brown. One time I waited 2 weeks and I swear there was mold growing on them. I really wonder if they do anything at all, but I can't say because I haven't tried the warmer without."
4,Does brown up as well as cloth wipe if not turned over,This is a good item and thank God they now sell them at local Walmart. Item does brown up if not turned over weekly like instructions say and will leave bad stain on cloth wipes.
5,FINALLY!,"With our first baby I received a Lionheart warmer and the pillow came with, however we are stationed overseas and we could never find the replacement pillows! My first child is 2 years old now and her pillow has never been changed (would just run under water to rinse & ring out then re-wet regularly)... it never smelled or discolored luckily! Glad I don't have to worry about any of that this time around!"
3,Haven't really needed them,It says to replace these pillows after a certain amount of time but the pillows I started out with seem to be just fine even after 2 years
2,dont really need these...,"I stopped buying these and my wipes no longer get ""burned"". I had alot of issues with my cloth wipes getting dried out, and it turns out the pad was absorbing all the moisture. I've stopped using them and no more browning or mildew. Go figure. :/"
4,Good enough,"They do a good job of keeping wipes warm and moist, but they can turn pretty brown. The directions warn of this, especially if you use wipes that have things like Aloe or scents. But it was nice for the middle-of-the-night diaper changes when a cold wipe would have made everyone's night a bad one!"
3,Packaging needs work,"No wear on the pad packaging does it tell you these get hard but re soften like new when you soak them. I figured it out on my own but not before I wasted a few. I looked it up online to confirm, you are suppose to re soak every week."
2,doesnt anyone know that tiger already made this?,"Bringing back retro is one thing, but re-releasing a ripp-off of the aibo is whole different story. [...]One site even boasts different body kits in different colors. Im not saying that this thing is bad..just totaly over priced. Go buy the same thing for way less. As far as the actual performance of the toy, it is fair, but being an Aibo owner (ERS-7/M2), I am biased toward the Aibo. The I-Cybie is slow, clumsby, and has a very short run time, though once I got an hour out of it. One good thing is that the thing will self right and is at least 80 percent effective. Cute, and fun, and as I mentioned earlier customizable, go do Tiger and Silver-Lit a favor, and give them credit where credit is due."
5,Outstanding Guide to the Use of the Router,This book is an excellent reference work and shop manual for the shaper and router. It is well illustrated and gives descriptions of commercially available jigs and attachments as well as practical designs for shop made accessories. I read this book at the home of a fellow woodworker and threatened to steal it from him. I can't wait to get my own copy.
2,Not his best,"I love Delbert McClinton but this CD is not his best. I can't complain about his singing or the band playing behind him as they sound good. I just couldn't get into most of these songs. Except for ""Before You Accuse Me"" and ""Solid Gold Plated Fool"" I found the songs to be kind of silly and thrown together."
4,Works as you'd expect.,"I was an early adopter of Sirius satellite radio. I purchased my radio well in advance of Howard Stern's arrival. I chose the JVC radio because of its portability to multiple cars. I purchased this dock so that I could listen to Sirius while at work. In our area there were no repeaters so you needed line of sight to the satellites. When I got the right angle to the birds in the sky, the signal was strong."
4,Good Introductory Book,"This book is a good introduction to less popular theories regarding the last days.It is a very easy read, with charts and explanations of where each theory comes from.If you have studied eschatology in depth, there is nothing new in this book.If you are a beginner, or if you are only familiar with the most prominent teachers, there is much to be gleaned.Although I do not agree with everything in the book, it is still a good read. What the author has written is theory, but does have scripture for most of the theories that could possibly back them up.Over all, if the only thing you know about the last days comes from the teachings of Hal Lindsey and Grant Jeffrey, I would recommend this book."
4,Shaver,"As a dry shaver, the Norelco works pretty well. Not as thrilled with it as a wet shaver. Uses too much gel and has problems missing stray hairs."
2,Loved it at first!,"This electric razor was awesome in the beginning. But, my hand was wet and it slipped out of my hand dropping about 8"" onto my counter. Upon impact, the top portion (the grill thing) popped open and a spring popped out. This happened the first week I purchased it. [...]"
5,Awsome Shaver,"This shaver is terrific and provides a close shave- but doesn't leave your skin raw or irritated if used in the shower with shaving cream. I have used a wet/dry shaver for over 10 years, from Panasonic foil (which cut my face)to Remingtom (no longer available) to Norelco (the best). I shave in the shower with shaving cream and never use it dry. Using it as a wet shaver, I no longer have trouble shaving my neck, or shaving when it is hot or humid. I no longer breakout from irritation and no longer have a raw neck. I also find rotary to be superior to foil for my facial hair, and this shaver meets my needs. I highly recommend this shaver to anyone who uses a shaver instead of blades and recommend anyone having even the least trouble using a dry shaver to try this wet shaver."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"THIS IS A HORRIBLE EXAMPLE OF AN ELECTRIC SHAVER. IT HAS TORN MY FACE APART AND LEAVES ME WITH A""5 O CLOCK"" SHADOW BY LUNCH. NO WHERE NEAR A CLOSE SHAVE. IT TAKES MORE TIME TO SHAVE WITH THIS PRODUCT VS A MANUAL SHAVER, I.E. ANY GILLETTE PRODUCT. I AM PROBABLY GOING TO SEND IT BACK TO NORELCO, PROBABLY WON'T GET MY MONEY BACK, BUT THEY NEED TO KNOW THIS IS DEFINITELY A HORRIBLE PRODUCT!"
4,Very good product,"(....). It takes some getting used to, but after a couple of weeks it provides a very comfortable shave. I got razor burn on my neck for the first couple weeks, but I think I was pressing too hard like I had to with my old razor. Just a light touch gives a close shave. The attachable sideburn trimmer doesn't do a very good job in my opinion, but I kept my old razor that worked better for that purpose. The gel packs go pretty quickly, but maybe I'm using too much. I'm still trying to get the hang of it. It's a different experience than your basic razor."
5,Great upgrade from my last Norelco,"After about 5 years I decided it was time to upgrade from my old 6756X and decided to give this one a try. This razor is so much better; the heads have much more flexibility and I am able to get a much better, quicker shave. It is also much easier to clean and the battery charge is longer and quicker to recharge.Great razor if you like the in-shower shave."
4,good shaver,"This is a good shaver, certainly the best electric i have used. gives a close shave but not as close as gillete mach 3. I apply my old shaving cream instead of the provided gel from the pouches, is more convinient that way."
3,"good shaver, some annoyances","performance of the shaver is very good. three major annoyances: (1) you can't plug the shaver in without the base, which means you gotta carry around the base and cord with you everywhere. bulkiness makes this a pain. (2) the trimmer works extremely well, but it's annoying that you need to switch the trimmer head with the regular head (and carry it around separately as well). (3) The hair falls out of the compartment while you shave, so you end up covered in hair. Which is fine if you're shaving before showering, but kind of gross when you have your clothes on."
3,Great Shaver but.....,I have owned my shaver for 8 days. It provides the best shave I have ever had from an electric. The problem is it isn't very durable. I dropped it coming out of the shower this morning from about 4 Ft to the bathroom carpet below. Game over! The head assembly came apart and not longer closes. A shaver to be used in and out of the shower should be more durable in my opinion.
5,The best electric shaver ever,"PROS: close shave; less skin irritation and no cut; quick charging; convenient LED displaysCONS: pricy; pricy cartridges; fragile looking bodyI've had this shaver for 10 days and am loving it. It only took me several days to get used to it. It is the closest shave I've ever had with an electric. Blade razors, like Mach 3, give better shaves but they usually leave cuts on my face so this was the best thing. I like the quick 1-hour charge a lot. The shaving time is actually shortened for me because I just do it during the shower. Nevertheless, the shaver at $120 is not cheap. Like others said, Nivea cartridges can run out fast. But I found a remedy- Nivea ""after shave balm"" 3.3 oz. at $4.79 in a local CVS pharmacy or Walmart gives you the same quality as little five Nivea 0.4 oz. cartridges(total 2 oz.) at $5 do. I hope this helps."
3,Nice shaver but not that great shaving dry or under the chin,I have been using mine for about two weeks. It is the closest shave I have ever gotten from an electric razor. You have to use it with the gell or shaving cream to get a close shave. It is quiet and rather quick to use and the charge seems to hold for a long time.It doesn't get under the chin well at all even with shaving cream or gell. I shave my cheeks with the electric and use a regular razor to finish under my chin.
4,Very Good Razor,"I have had this 7775x Norelco for atleast 4 years now..It has been great. The shave in the shower just using regular foam is great. I never used the Nivea refills much. I have had no problems or failures with this or my first Norelco wet shaver I bought. I still have it the original ""Advantage"" model before the cool skin series came out..Both still work fine and just need new blade replacements..Which leads me to my next purchase. The Norelco 8020x will be my next razor. I think its time and with the costly replacement heads getting harder and harder to find I think I will upgrade to the new 8020x model at the end of the year.. But this razor has been fantastic."
1,Not what I expected,"Since I suffer from razor burn, I thought an electric razor with built in lotion would be ideal. I found that it did not give me a close shave and the odor of the lotion was very sweet. I used it for a week and returned it for a full refund."
4,"Rick Nelson ""Garden Party/Windfall"" BGOCD333","Like other MOR ""country rock"" heads in 1974, I was sidetracked listening to Henley & company when ""Windfall"" was released. This is one of the most overlooked albums from arguably the best decade in pop/rock. Every track is distinctly different. As with most albums there are a couple of ""filler"" tunes. Can you listen to the Eagles first album or ""Desperado"" without skipping a track? Despite the higher price of a 2 for 1 CD and being a U.K. import at around $20.00 this is a MUST have. If you enjoyed Poco, Pure Prairie League, Firefall, etc. this one outdoes them all. Listening is believing. Peace."
5,"A ""Must-Have"" Book for Children of all ages","I gave this book to my friend's growing daughter who adores SHOES! I've been told it's been read everyday for 3 weeks straight now! Ironically, the Fink is her favorite. Look out Teletubbies, and hang on to your red purse, Tinkie Winkie...here comes the Fink!"
5,"DeNiro, Nicholson, Hoffman, The Fink.","The beautiful story of a girl named Sassparilla who turns a pair of hand-me-down shoes into the soles of a thousand aspirations. Sassparilla can make everything of nothing, and makes all of it her own. The perfect book to show our children to place their castles high in the air while sharing the foundations under them.(Keep your eye out for The Fink, the comic-relief gecko lizard who hilariously disco-dances, figure-skates, and sumo-wrestles his way through Sasparilla's adventures.)"
5,A universally appealing book for all ages!,"Sassparilla's New Shoes is one of those truly rare books that can be enjoyed equally by a child and a grown-up. The story follows a delightful Chinese American girl as she tries on different pairs of shoes and imagines herself in imaginative situations. The prose is quick and witty and the color illustrations add an extra element of fun. This is an instant classic, one that I look forward to reading to my nephews and nieces again and again!"
3,A very good start to your reunion planning.,"This book is a must-read as you begin your reunion planning. It starts the ball rolling with ideas and insights on what is important and fun for all. It also lays out a timetable for what should be done at any given time in the planning process.However, if you are deep into the planning process and are looking for answers to specific questions, this book may be too generic for you. I found some helpful insights, but no real meaty solutions to my problems with finding classmates, cost-cutting, etc. Also, some suggestions seemed to be geared toward an older crowd with less technical knowledge. A directory of good internet people-search sites was sadly absent.In all, I think it is a good book to read as you are about to pick a date, place, theme, and time, but not as helpful if you are close to the date and need some quick advice."
4,Come on People,"Geez, guys, It is a slot car game, not an actual race car game. Of course you can't steer your vehicle. Didn't you play with slot cars when you were kid.This is a fun game and my wife will actually play it with me because you don't have to worry about the steering. You can and have to switch lanes so it not like you just hold the button and you win.This game has made me want to go out and buy an actual slot car set again."
4,YOU CAN'T DO WHAT?,This is a racing game that looks simple. Only one big problem! YOU CAN'T STEER YOUR VEHICLE! This is a very bad idea! One of the worst games ever!
3,"Whatever you do, don't mention data!","I enjoyed the early part of the book. The examples worked beautifully every time. I felt I was learning about C# and ASP.NET at the same time.As I progressed through the book I wondered when they were going to get to databases. They never did. What about Cookies? They are not mentioned either! OK, no book can cover everything, and who'd want it to. But this one simply doesn't go far enough even for a c#/.net novice like me.In summary, a good starting point but you'll soon need other books beside this one."
5,WEB and C#,"Just getting started with WEB, so I turned to these guys because their C++ book is so great. This is a good book too. I didn't know too much about C#, except what I've read in magazines.This book got me up and running in no time. This book is really good if you have any kind of Windows programming experience (which I do). They show you how to fold Windows programming concepts into WEB creations with C#.What I like best about their books is ;the large number of programming examples."
3,Not the set to get,"While it is true that there are some very nice performances in this set, it is no bargain at the price at which it is being offered as I write this review. At this writing there are a couple of copies left of the same recordings, at less than half the price of this set, with 19 additional Mozart symphonies, including the first ten. As Tate does an even better job with the early symphonies than the late ones, the bargain represented by *this* setMozart: 51 Symphoniesis all the sweeter. I also advise you to avoid the Tate/ECO CDs containing only the late symphonies; it is these in which Tate and the ECO are least successful. The thing that would be nice would be to be able to buy a set consisting of Tate/ECO playing only the first 30 Mozart symphonies; but given the current low price of the complete set of 51, one would not expect such a compilation to be any cheaper. See my very lengthy review of the 51-symphony set under its listing."
2,A drab book that lacks excitement,"I picked up this book expecting to find a book packed with intricate mysteries and excitement only to be disappointed by being presented with a series of stories that I can only describe as lame and totally uninteresting. Luckily, there are a few stories worthy of reading that rescues the book from being given a rating of 2 or less. I was surprised at the inconsistency found in the writing styles. There were only about 4 out of the 15 stories worthy of reading. All the rest would have put any poor soul to sleep by 2nd paragraph! Totally disappointing and not worth being published as a hardcover...way over priced!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"As a long-time Holmes fan, I have read most of the stories written by a surprisingly vast number of authors. I have found, for the most part, that it doesn't make much difference in the quality of the story if the author is a ""famous"" author or relatively unknown. The writing may be good but the story is trash. As was the case here.Why do authors have to incorporate famous people with Holmes? How many ""ripper"" stories have been written? Now we find Holmes on the Titanic -- and apparently the ""mystery"" was secondary to the description of the ship. We also are subjected to a story regarding Doyle's temptation into adultry -- since when has Holmes been a marriage counselor? And to have him and Watson race to get to the hotel ""in time"" to prevent it is not only stupid but hokey as well!A few stories had merit but not enough to make the price of this over size paperback worth it."
2,Not the best anthology,"I thought this book was going to be better than it was, especially after reading Marvin Kaye's other Holmes anthology, ""The Resurrected Holmes"". I was disappointed in the slim pickings in this volume. Only a few of the stories were actually good and worth reading. Some, like ""A Ballad of the White Plague"" and ""Vittoria, the Circus Belle"", are flat-out strange. It was quite a disappointment, especially for Holmes fans."
5,Anthology lovers will adore this mystery collection,"This Sherlock Holmes short story collection consists of fourteen tales written by different authors. Every story is well written and brings out Holmes personality as if Doyle wrote the book. The usual players, such as Watson, are in attendance. However, the most intriguing notion about this anthology is Holmes' brilliantly described relationships with noted figures of the late nineteenth century such as Ida Tarbell, Arthur Conan Doyle (don't get schizoid), James McNeil Whistler, and P. G. Wodehouse, etc.Though this has been done numerous times before, the technique remains fresh in the hands of the assorted authors. This is an anthology that does justice to the master, making it worth reading by all detective fans.Harriet Klausner"
2,"Some merit, but not my cup of tea","As one who truly loves the original, I found most of the stories in this far-fetched and far more dark. More dark and strange than most pastiches, even. It was like someone taking Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to a rave party or something -- it was 20th century writing with 19th century (okay early 20th century too) characters. I just didn't care for it."
1,Lemon - Terrible experience with this Sony product,Recently bought a brand new Sony VAIO VGC-RA828G. Has never worked. Sony has replaced the memory and motherboard. Just completed a full recovery and now hard drive is bad. Sony has me shipping it back to them even though I've had an onsite technician here three times. Sony refuses to give me my money back or new machine. The best I can hope for now is a rebuilt lemon. Please don't make the same mistake I did. Buy a Dell
5,Spooky good time,"A Review by JohnnyThe book The hitch hiker is a groovy book. The book is about two girls that just got their drivers license and decide to go on a road trip , what they don't know is they got in store for them. On the way there they find a man who wants a ride. The book kept me on the edge and I could not set it down. If you like scary good times you should read this book.The book was very scary and fun .In some parts in the book I got confused because of the triky word play. Over all I really loved this book!!!I recommend this book to little boys and little girls looking for a fun fun book to read."
3,Just Okay......,Two Girls pick up a lonely Hitchiker.He seems to be running away from his past(or is he).While traveling they hear of a murder supposely by a hitchhiker.Can he be the one?Or can it be the person in the car that's always following them.Guess you'll have to read the book to find out.
3,The same murder book all over again,"R.L Stine is a great author but sometimes he uses the same ideas over again. If you have read The Boy Next Door(Fear Street)you'd see my point.This is a great suspense book for other readers who are new to R.L stine but not for readers who read a similar book.This book is about a Hitch Hicker named James who wants to get away from Key West as soon as possible,so he hitches with Christina and Terri who are headed to Cleveland.But strange thinks happen that make you very suspicious.This book is pretty boring until the end!"
5,Smashing,Great book. A mystery all the way to the end. Very freaky. I guarantee you'll like it if you read it.
3,"okay, nothing more","Christina and Terri pick up a hitchhiker, despite Terri's protests. As they drive through the swamps of Florida, Christina is flirting with him while Terri is wondering what's wrong with him. Why does he keep losing control over his anger? What is he hiding? Will this drive be their last?Not too bad, but Stine can do better."
3,Espresso,I normally have Kimbo espresso and thought I would give it a try - I am sure it is a good product but it does not come close to the Kimbo product.
5,Stunning account of comic theory as literary paradigm,"This is an important rereading of Freudian and Lacanian theory as anticipations of poststructuralist philosophy and aesthetics. It also stands as an evaluation of Freud as a major theory of literature and culture, through a striking rereading of the Oedipal configuration not as ""family romance"" but as aesthetic structure. Highest rating!"
5,2 years and running great,"Very quiet fan for how powerful it is. I love the programming options it provides for the timer. Oscillation is still quiet as it rotates. it is fairly heavy which is good news for those like use that have kids who tend to know everything over. the controller works great as well. It gets called R2-D2 alot which is weird since we arent star wars fans, but if your into that then this is a plus."
2,Not a good value,"It's a decent fan, but definitely not worth the money. For the money paid, it should have a more powerful breeze.Pro's:-Quiet. Barely notice the fan on.-Features. 3 speeds, remote control, ion, and oscillating.Con's:-Weak. Even on the highest speed, there isn't a great breeze.-Poor value. You can probably get a better fan for the money.-Low to the ground. You won't feel the breeze if your laying in bed or elevated area."
1,The worst fan ever!,"I purchased this fan, which is a tower fan, instead of a regular oscillating fan because the review was so positive. This fan is horrible!!!! It barely has an impact on the temperature and especially with the worst heat wave ever in the country, buying something that does not work is an insult. Not to mention that this fan was $20 more than the standard fans! Do not buy this fan unless you want an ornament for the room it is in. I was not allowed to get a refund, so beware before you make a purchase."
2,poor air flow,For the money that I spent this fan should blow harder. It like the cheaper fans are powerful then this fan. unsatisfied customer.
1,Missing part,"The base needs to be assembled , the ones I received only allowed one side to be attached. there are two different sides. I am now waiting to hear from the seller on what they are going to do"
1,I hate it!!,This was a frustrating purchase. I probably read 100 reviews on Amazon to find a tower fan with a very quiet rating. I can say my research was a failure because there is a clicking sound that seems like the fan blades are brushing past a little slip of paper. So irritating. I will be returning this awful thing.
1,"The ""Ionizer"" feature on this fan is a joke","If you are buying this for a quiet fan only, great. If you're looking for a room ionizer, don't waste your time!After running this in the same room for three days (with the Ion function turned on), I noticed absolutely no difference in the quality of the air, nor can you even remove the ""Ionizer"" from the fan to clean it, likely because there isn't one!Don't bother with this piece of junk."
5,Remote Controlled Tower Fan,"I love my SPT SF-1521 LCD Remote Fan. Not to discount its utility, but it is so very attractive - a clean look with this slender silhoutte and all these blue visuals at the top.Now to its utility: It is relatively quiet, it rotates, just the perfect amount of air without causing me to sneeze as other fans do. Even my cat loves it! Heidi (my cat) would quickly scoot by my other fans, but she will sit in front of this one. What greater testimonal do you want? (Lol)SPT SF-1521 LCD Remote Controlled Tower Fan with IONYes, I am very happy with this purchase."
4,Pretty good,"For a tower fan, this is pretty solid. If you really want to move air in a room, I would suggest a traditional round fan. The tower is a little short in my opinion. We have a taller bed and I can barely feel the air movement when I lay on it. The oscilation doesn't make that annoying clicking noise. The controls are simple. Overall, a pretty good fan."
4,SPT SF-1521 LCD Remote Controlled Tower Fan with ION,I like the fan very much = would be nice if you could save your sleep settings. otherwise it isgreat
3,A little short but nice,"Its a little short and a little more noise than I expected. It is however nice looking, well made, easy to move and the remote is very good. We use the fan in our bedroom so the noise issue is a major concern if used in other applications it may be just fine.Amazon verified putchase"
3,"Good fan, poor remote","The fan works well enough. It moves a nice amt of air in a fairly quiet fashion.The remote though is hugely frustrating. It must be pointed directly at the fanand then it takes several attempts before the fan responds. (BTW, I am about 8 feetfrom the fan) Of course I've tried new batteries, tightening the battery contactsand cleaning the IR window on both ends, but it still works poorly."
4,"Works well, but a little large","This fan has all the features that I wanted, and it works well. However, I was a little surprised at the size of it. I had a similar type of fan a few years ago and it did not take up so much space. Not an overriding concern for us, but it might be for some."
2,Disappointing,"I read the reviews and most rated this pretty high. I bought it to replace a ten-year-old rotating tower fan and the difference is startling. This new one is weak in comparison. It doesn't seem to push the air as far as my old one did, and I have to run it at high speed most of the time. On the positive side, it is far quieter than my previous fan."
1,Very disappointed with this fan,"I received the fan today, with wonderful shipping time from Amazon. To my dismay, I set the pedestal up for the fan to screw into (butterfly nuts), plugged it into the outlet, and it ran for a grand total of 10 seconds! I tried it again and the fan would not even turn on! The inside was making some buzzing motor noise. Also the screen had a nice size scratch on it when I took it out of the box, so I was not too happy about that either. I returned it within 5 minutes of receiving it. Very very disappointed, especially after reading so many of the great reviews."
2,not so quiet,"I bought this because a review indicated it was so quiet it could hardly be heard 5 ft away. This fan is just as noisy as any of the mega discount store variety and noisier than some! I think I'd have to be 40 ft or more away to hardly hear it. However, if you want plenty of breeze, it doesn't lack air movement even on the lowest speed. If you want a real quiet fan, look elsewhere."
5,"Product great, price not so great",Why is the price so high? I just bought this same product in the same packaging for $6.99 from the local Fresh Market Grocery.
5,hygrozyme,"Truely believe a person gets what they pay for with this product. Wouldn't grow without it, especially hydroponics, because it cleans the roots which ultimately determines how good a persons crop will turn out. This product pushes a persons garden from a good or great to superior. Have used hygrozyme for four years ever since I found out about it and swear by it to help me on my never ending quest to perfection on a regular basis either in soil, soilless, or hydro growing. I've tryed the competitors, but have always come back to hygrozyme because simply put it is the ""best"" of the best."
4,Donhnie Darko Import Soundtrack well done,"The import edition of the Donnie Darko soundtrack is two discs. One is the actual pop songs, and some classical works, which are all very good and includes the remake of Tears for Fears ""Mad World."" The second disc is the instrumental score, with two versions of ""Mad World,"" included as well. The instrumental score is very dark and omenous, and the two disc set is a nice collectible piece of music that I highly reccommend. The price is a bit high, at over $30, but if you are any type of a fan of the movie, or a soundtrack collector, this album is for you."
4,good soundtrack,"I've never purchased this item, but i've watched the movie enough to love the versions of the songs. Watching the commentary gives some insight into them also."
3,Worthy of a re-watch,"Not sure if I like the provocative teenage drama that goes along with it, but it definitely drew my attention when I was younger. It took me some time to grasp a hold of it, but I believe it to have insights into karma and fulfilling your own destiny. Rather interesting."
4,They Finally Came Out With This!,"Ever since I have seen this movie, I have been wanting the soundtrack for it. The score is not bad, but the type of music that is in the movie is my favorite, and I just wanted to be able to have it all on one disc. I love the songs on the first disc, but I don't believe I have ever listened to the second disc a full time through. I am just happy this finally came out."
4,Donnie Darko,"Given as a gift to a teenage friend. She just loved the video and said the sountrack was great, too."
4,Provides a Paul Shepard Critique,"I would add to the previous review that the first chapter provides a critique of Paul Shepard's thesis that our society is broken, and will never become whole again until we return to our hunter-gatherer roots. I was interested in this because I am a big Paul Shepard fan and have not before seen a critique of his ideas from a source I can respect. I don't know that Flores even gets Shepard's ideas completely straight, and I wish he had devoted more space to his critique, but at least it's something to get you thinking about.I hope I haven't turned off those looking for a more straight-forward natural history of the West and southern plains, because except for that first chapter, that's what this book is- and it's excellent in its digestible chapters on components of this region."
1,Disappointed,"As a kickbox instructor, I like to purchase kickbox videos for additional ideas to use in my classes. I read the 5-star review, purchased the video, but ended up thoroughly disappointed. I found several problems with the with weights is too fast, the woman's counting is not at all at a consistant speed (but IS monotonous), the kickbox movements are sequenced in a very strange manner--it's hard to keep the heart rate up. Don't waste your money on this one; there are a lot of good kickbox videos available."
1,Is ti possible to give NO stars,"This video sucked BIG TIME... I was looking for a good cardio kickboxing tape to add to my collection... I thought I'd give it a shot.. If could have reached in a grabbed that woman I would have.. her voice is annoying, her counting is annoying, this tape is annoying...They seemed out of breath before they even got started..I did find some use though.. I will use this tape as a door stop."
4,Good product -- just a bit big.,"I got this for Christmas and have used it under my motorcycle helmet several times this winter -- just rode this morning with the temp at 39F. Coupled with a neck warmer, it has worked well to keep the chill out. I'm sure it wouldn't do well in colder climes--it's designed to keep your head cool after all. I like the feel and it seems it's good quality, certainly a good value.My only complaint is as others have said, it's to big for my average size (I think) head. I will do as another reviewer did and have my wife sow fold in the the elastic band. Should be perfect then. Looking forward to seeing how it works this summer."
3,For LARGE heads only,"I have an average size head, and this thing is huge on me. One size does not fit most. The product itself is great and has a great feel, bought it to wear under my motorcycle helmet. I am sure I'll wear it and just sew the elastic band up to fit my head. For the money it's a good product, just wish they didn't make it so big."
1,Junk!,I wear a lot of doo rags but I can't wear this one. The band that goes around the back of your head is too loose and no way to tighten it. I cut this band out thinking I could tighten the doo rag with the ties in the back but it's just not made right... not for my head anyway. I like the nylon material so I will keep it and use it as a polishing rag but certainly not as a doo rag. No... I do not recommend this product to anyone!
5,It truly is a ball joint!!!!!,"Part is exactly what I needed, a ball joint. Had to check with a few different part stores to be sure it was the correct number because the picture is completely wrong. Great part, poor picture."
5,Jaw Dropping Inspiration,"The depth and breadth of what GP can do just isn't known by the techies. This book should scare those that are content to repeat the same old design rules. The book is a bit dry for someone with only a passing interest, but I think that was the author's intent: show in unhyped, and no-uncertain terms that GP can do what we do. For someone with a curious mind, this is proof of a brave new world."
4,So far it seems like a great Organizer,"I've just received the organizer and this is my first week. I think it's going to work great. I don't have kids but I think it will still work if you have different things in your life you want to keep track of. What I like is that it divides different subjects within the week to better organize yourself. The only thing I see now that I would change is a better way to find the months. Other then that, I like it."
4,Fun,This etiquette book is great for a look back into the world of your parents. you'll get some helpful tips and aome good laughs.
5,tel time mens chrome talking watch black face expansion band,"it arrived a advertised. face is easy to see, voice is easy to hear. chime tone is pleasant. once i figured out the different buttons it is easy to set time etc."
3,2 hand mug,"Mug was very easy to hold, kept drink warm longer, it is also very light. Now comes the but.......the top rim of the mug chipped after about 8 uses. Had always hand washed it, was never dropped. Rim was coming off in small slivers that could have been swallowed & injured the user or the resulting gaps in the rim could have cut the users lip. My advice is to pass on this mug if it will be for someone who has visual problems."
4,Intriguing characters,"Wow. What an intriguing story. I was pleasantly surprised at how well I liked it. The heroine wasn't the least bit annoying as I've found to be the case in most books by Greenwood. It felt like there was something missing in the hero; I can't even begin to name what it was. But, all in all, I liked the story, loved the characters--especially Hen--found the conflict interesting, and while the ending felt a little forced, I even liked it.This story contains graphic love scenes."
4,"Wonderful begining to ""Seven Brides Series""","Leigh Greenwood's Seven Brides Series captivated me with 'Rose', the first book of the series. I am an avid Western Historical Fiction reader, so the concept of this series intriged me. Boy did Leigh Greenwood deliver! Rose, is hired as a cook/housekeeper to the seven rough, rowdy and untamed Randolph brothers. The two oldest brothers have just returned to their Texas cattle ranch after the end of the Civil War to find that their father has died in the war, their mother died of grief, and their brother Madison has left the four youngest brothers to fend for themselves. The brothers are a hot mess! The oldest brother George, thinks he is hiring a housekeeper to clean it up, but he finds that only the love and care of this brave woman named Rose can save them and keep them together. In the process, George and Rose find everlasting love in each other."
3,Could have been better......,"I was really excited to start this book and had planned on reading the entire series after I read all of the stellar reviews. However, I was extremely disappointed once I started reading! The basic story is good, but the writing itself did not appeal to me in the least. The characters tend to ramble on and on without much dialogue for pages upon pages....and then when there is dialogue it isn't very good. The characters are generally likable, but the poor writing, the length of the novel, and the constant whining make this book hard to get into. I would like to know about the other characters stories, but I'm not sure that I could stand to read the other books in this series if they are similar."
3,Could have been better,"I'am a fan of Leigh Greenwood, especially his Cowboy series. I thought this would transfer to the Bride series but I found Rose (first novel in the series) to be okay. There were a few scenes that I enjoyed but I believe the author could have developed the characters further. Overall the book is a good read but I was disappointed."
3,Be Careful,"This topic line says Volume I and Volume II but most sellers will only ship one.Argh. I need both volumes and paid for ""both"" but only one was shipped to me.It was ""bargain quality books.""I accidentally left positive feedback so I wanted to write a comment about it since I cant erase feedback."
3,"Wow! This is allergy free! The sugar free, allergy free concept","The recipes in this book are good. But be careful if you plan to follow the four day rotation diet contained here. This diet is only for people who are allergic to the same things to which the author is allergic. The allergies my family has are very different and the four day plan that we must follow is also different. Just know that these four day plans come tailor made for the person who has allergy tests done by the company about which she speaks and your diet may NOT be the same as the one she has published. That said, if you purchase this book do so for the recipes and the ideas, but not for the diet rotation plan."
4,"Good, inexpensive replacement","I had to take the gold colored outer shell off and replaced it with the black shell on my lamp, but the switch worked great. It's a lot cheaper than buying another lamp."
4,Underrated Anthony Quinn Western,"Anthony Quinn and William Conrad (of Cannon television show fame and the voice of Matt Dillon on the Gunsmoke Radio program) star in this overlooked western about a Texas border town marshal who goes to Mexico looking for accused killer Anthony Quinn, who has taken up with a woman and endeared himself to the citizens of the little village where he lives.Conrad forces Quinn to return with him to stand trial, and their journey brings peril at every turn, causing the two enemies to begrudgingly depend and rely on each other.Both Quinn and Conrad give first-rate performances and bring dignity to the proceedings. Don't pass up the opportunity to see or own this fine film."
3,The Ride Back,"Has some depth and complexity. Similar plot to that of 3:10 to Yuma: lone, troubled lawman bringing a charismatic fugitive to justice. I could have done without Eddie Albert blasting out the film's ballad on the soundtrack."
3,A complex collection of electronic sounds and sequences.,"As a keen collector of Tangerine Dream I bought this album to see how DAT compared. The music is well recorded, with crystal clear sounds. When first listening to the CD it is very hard to follow, as the tracks seem to lack a central rhythm or beat to carry you through the movements. I would classify this as soundtrack music for scifi type films. An excellent test for any HIFI and once understood, an enjoyable collection of electronic sounds and sequences."
3,binoculars,I bought these binoculars. I was disappointed. They take fuzzy pictures and you can't adjust the zoom on them. They don't work very good for stargazing.
5,Just go buy it.,I can't say enough about this dvd. It's excellent!! If you are a Zeppelin fan you will not be disappointed.
5,My Jaw Hit The Floor,"For me, being a younger fan of hard rock, I was born after the began stopped touring together. I have only heard bits and pieces of them play live, and the only time I have seen them live is in ""The Song Remains The Same"". This DVD has every filmed performance they have ever had. There is no band that can top this.When I bought the DVD I also bought ""How The West Was Won"" and again its another amazing record. By far the best track on there is the 25 minute jam of ""Dazed And Confused"".These two are must haves for anyone. Zeppelin fan, Hard Rock fan, or any random stranger you meet on the street deserves to have these."
5,WE'RE NOT WORTHY!! WE'RE NOT WORTHY!!,It's a TEN starts double DVD! Five stars to each disc! Jimmy Page has proved that he's still a genius! What more can I say?
5,Great DVD,My favorite band is Led Zeppelin and the is a must see for all zeppelin fan or not. Just to be able to see Jimmy Page on the guitar or John Bohnam on drums is all u need anyway but this is a VERY good dvd with all there hits songs on it.
2,Akron '74?????,"Since this DVD contains absolutely ZERO footage (no fooling,not even a second) from their seminal show at the summer 1974 Akron Rubber dome concert I must say I consider it a bit of a ripoff, and as I was only one of 18,000 people who attended this gig, I rather doubt that I'll be the only totally bummed Zep fan, what gives? On another note, one would be amiss not to mention the interminable length of this seemling unending concert disc. My god , this thing just seems to go on forever. Not 2 hours, not 3, but 5 1/2 ear-shattering hours. Even Woodstock at 3 days seemed to embrace more brevity than this lumbering behemoth. Frankly, I could not get through the damn thing in one sitting, but then I'm not the seasoned concert-goer I once was. Oh well. All things considered though, a stone classic, if you only buy one music DVD in your lifetime, do yourself a helluva big favor and make it this one. 'nuff said...."
2,For Led Zep fan only,"This is for Led Zep fan only. Many video were not in top quality. For general music fans, skip this.The Song Remains the Same is a much better choice."
2,Is this Zeppelin or Spinal Tap?,"There is some good stuff here, particulairly the earlier performances. But Jimmy tends to solo too much and too long. And Robert Plant postures too much without any sense of humour. And we do not need 4 different versions of Dazed and Confused. The one great thing about this dvd is that we really see how great a musician John Paul Jones is. Brilliantly playing a variety of instruments while always staying cool. But after witnessing the plodding Knebworth performances, I thankfully remembered that The Clash had by that time already saved the true spirit of rock and roll. If you buy this dvd, you may only end up watching the first three minutes of each song."
4,Led Zeppelin DVD,Dvd was exactly as described. Arrived properly packaged on the date expected. Smooth transaction. I would recommend this to any fan!
5,"Amazing, A Must Have","5+ hours of concert footage, interviews, promos, etc. This is an amazing collection of Led Zeppelin material. Best of all, the quality (both video and audio) is absolutely outstanding. Crystal clear concert video footage from 1970 through 1979. 3 audio tracks: DTS, Dolby 5.1, or PCM Audio. The DTS track sounds like you're sitting front row at these concerts.Led Zeppelin fans must own this. Even remote Zeppelin fans should own this. Must have DVD for any collection."
5,Anyone who is a fan of music will enjoy this......,"Don't listen to anyone who thinks this isn't worth it. While there are plenty of great bands and performers out there today, not one in the pop music scene, especially Justine Timberlake, can hold a candle to these guys. Led Zeppelin plays a pivotal role in rock and roll history. Their influence will be felt, and talked about, long after the ""stars"" of today lose their luster...This DVD is excellent. Video footage is good and the sound quality is fantastic. It gives great insight into the strength of this band live. The music is almost timeless. For people who were not old enough to see this band, this DVD is the next best thing to being there."
5,Incredible thunderous blast from the past!,"As everyone knows it has been a very long time since Led Zeppelin has been at the forefront of rock and roll, in fact, an entire generation has passed. For those who have never experienced this incredible and easily,and I mean EASILY, the best hard rock/ blues band of all time, these DVDs capture exactly what they were all about.If you like Led Zep........PURCHASE THIS IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Awesome.,"Page is beyond description, but contrary to the reviews in Guitar One Magazine, Page is not the whole band. Without Plant, and the others, it just wouldn't be the same. But Jimmy Page (and I am a guitarist- I'd like to think), must have practiced about 5 million hours, and then got completely creative to play like this. There usually is just not enough time to get that good without some (insanity?). Not only does he play clean, but he and the band get totally aberrated once in a while, for the contrast back to the resolve on the next clean number. Amazing. God bless that band. PLC One last thing, the only improvement that could have been, would have been the camera men, who filmed this years ago, were obviously not musicicans. They kept cutting away from Page's left hand, not allowing the viewer to see what chords he was playing. Too bad. Newer videos, have great footage, and closeups of guitar fretboards."
2,GREAT AUDIO/DISTRACTING VIDEO,"Remember this name--DICK CARRUTHERS. If you are tempted to buy a DVD that he produced, DON'T!!! Watching this dvd is an exercise in torture. Working with superb audio the producer has managed to destroy what could have been an outstanding collection of classic led zepplin works by changing cameras FAR too frequently. On a couple of the cuts, the number of camera changes is in the 40 to 50 range for a three minute song. Some of the longer cuts have OVER 100 CAMERA CHANGES IN A SINGLE SONG!! As a result there is no opportunity to enjoy the work of Page or Plante because the camera never stays on them for more than 5 seconds. What a shame, using this technique to its extreme and destroying what could have been a superb, classic work."
3,Not too shabby!,"Some real good sound and picture quality going on here. Also some scenes and interesting camera angles that made it more interesting than the run-of-the-mill ""rockumentary"". Jimmy Page is an extraordinary guitarist no doubt, but I thought a little too much attention was given to his constant hyper-speed attack on his guitar rather than his ability to reach the listener with true music - I guess that's what he thought we wanted playing live. That being my only complaint, it should be a double disc DVD dream come true for a hard-core Led Zep fan."
5,I could not sit down,"I could not sit down, I could not leave the room, and I could not but CRANK UP THE VOLUME.Playing this DVD fills the void in my soul.Thank you Led Zeppelin."
5,Classic Zeppelin from the Early Days to Later Days,"A MUST for any LZ fan. Incredible video available for the first time - The Royal Albert Hall material alone is worth the purchase. The raw energy of this 1970 performance is astounding. For those who couldn't get enough of MSG '73 - all the remaining footage and finally, the Knebworth material shows how tight the band was until their final days. What more can be said about the greatest band of all time..This DVD says it all!!!"
4,Why No Song-By-Song Menus?,"Excellent quality and value overall, but with one significant oversight - I couldn't find a navigation menu to jump around song-by-song. The navigation menu lets you jump by section; i.e., from Earl's Court to Knebworth, but they don't make it easy to jump ahead to Stairway to Heaven, or skip over Dazed and Confused or Moby Dick. Failure to include such basic function on a modern DVD is an oversight that will detract from enjoyment on repeated listens.I'd still recommend this highly, however, since you get a lot of great material and a welcome alternative to the high-priced ... bootlegs that were the only source for so many years."
5,Excellent!,"To those who read what 'The Cranky Reviewer' wrote, please ignore the comment. This cranky person either can't tell who is really talented or he was being sarcastic.This DVD may not have the best picture, but it is really good. Even if you are not a big fan of Led Zeppelin, you will enjoy it, for sure."
5,More than living up to their reputation,"For a band for which there is such infamously little video footage, I am amazed at all the camera shots in this work of art. Not for one second does this DVD dissapoint. From the golden riff of ""Whole Lotta Love"" to the great epic ""Achilles Last Stand"" this band more than lives up to its reputation as an incredible live performance. Maybe I'm just biased because I've been forever starving for a Led Zeppelin video, but I think that its safe to say this is the most incredible DVD in the history of the universe."
2,Led Zepprlin,"If you are a die-hard zep fan, this is for you. It's fine if you are expecting a documentary. As a casual fan, I was hoping for 1 great performance captured by competent film makers, such as the Pink Floyd dvd Pulse."
2,dissapointing compared to the song remains the same,"As a zepp fan who has collected audio bootlegs over the years I must say that this is a dissapointing dvd. When you read the liner notes you will see they didn't have the luxury of choosing the best of what they had, rather what barely survived. The song remains the same is a better concert video and the highlight of the dvd is the outake of the ocean from song. Song is tighter and has less of plant ruining the song with add lib gibberish. Don't get your hopes too high, or rather wait and buy it next week in a used cd store."
2,"Pre ""High-Tech"" Recording Quality","I would rate this 2 stars as the visual/video component is very weak and looks ancient (30 years old) when compared to dvd's with today's technology. This is heavy duty hard rock with some classics like Stairway to Heaven, Rock and Roll and Whole Lotta Love. Unfortunately, with recordings 30 years old, they did not have the benefit of today's high technology which makes it not as visually interesting as the five star dvd's (like Rolling Stones, Cher Farewell Tour, Eagles, Beatles Anthology, Fleetwood Mac, U2)."
2,Another bad live Zeppelin performance.,I wonder if they used studio musicians to record the albums. Cause they never sound very good live. Maybe if they stopped hot dogging long enough to remember what they are playing.I am a huge Zep fan. But I just dont get why they cant sound good live.
1,BIIIIIIIIIIIIG Disappointment,"Ok, here's the low down on this DVD. It shows a select number of songs from various shows throughout Led Zep's career. But it does some things wrong: it cuts between camera angles for dramatic effect, but it really just looks [bad]; it takes video cuts from different songs in the same concerts (watch Immigrant song, there will be a couple instances where JPJ is playing a different bass); the music just [stunk]. Jimmy Page plays very sloppy, so much that it hurts. Plant also has an uncontrolled soprano that just screeches around for no real reason. Its funny listening him do that simulate orgasm thing, which just sounds silly cuz at the end, i go ""CHOO!"". The first disc, almost all of the songs sound exactly the same, and Page does this solo called ""white summer"" which is extremely sloppy and unimaginative. He also tries to play fast, which really digs his own grave there. that's just the beginning of a bunch of things wrong with this DVD, save your money."
1,Loud Noise,A waste of money for a DVD with poor resolution and loud noise that hurts your ears and gives you a headache. I guess instead of touring they dusted off some old junk and released it to the public. I don't get this at all. Don't waste your time.
5,Remarkable!,"The very long wait to get vintage live Led Zeppelin on DVD was well worth it; this is about as complete and comprehensive as you'll get it!Spanning the classic years of Zep (were there any UN-classic ones?), the performances are awesome as are the picture and sound quality of the DVD's. This is very small criticism, but I think they could've done without including clips from ""The Song Remains The Same"", but I guess it would be cool for those who don't own the movie (but if you're a true Zep fan, why wouldn't you own it?)You couldn't ask for a better document of this legendary band; it's a must-have, so buy it!"
5,Bonhams solo is a drummers dream,"Zeppelin has always been my favorite band and Bonham my favorite drummer. I am a drummer and have always idolized Bonham but never had a chance to see his true ability being too young to see them live. I had always heard how hard hitting Bonham was but you can never experience it until you see his solo in this DVD. The ferocity and intensity in this solo is awe inspiring. The 30 minute solo blows my mind. To see the speed and power he had is short of otherworldly. Neil Peart has always been a favorite of mine, but he uses many drums and a lot of different sounds to get his sound out, but bonham uses a basic drumkit and ghost beats to a level I have never experienced.As for the rest of Zep, it is truly amazing that the 4 greatest musicians of all time managed to be in the same group. After watching the DVD you realize how revelutionary and ahead of there time they were. Especially the Finnish radio show!tuen it up and enjoy."
5,great dvd,I love this dvd. Absolutely amazing collection of performances.Excellent restoration work too. Highly recommended!
3,Wish there were more extras.,"I enjoyed seeing the Zeppelin concert clips. It was neat seeing them over the years. It would have been nicer if they had more extras - interviews, behind the scenes, etc.."
5,For all Led Zeppelin Fans and Rock fans in general,"I cannot add more words than what the other viewers have already posted. I do want to say that this DVD simply surpassed all my expectations on what I would see and hear! The concerts, TV appearances, etc. are excellent. I especially loved it when they showed them from the very early years when they were young, lean and mean. The later years still showed their veracity, but also their improvement on their performances (Musically that is).It is a far cry better than ""The Song Remains the Same""."
5,Must own,"This DVD set includes an array of recorded shows and interviews that should be in every collection of every led zeppelin fan: from the raw synergy of the gladsaxe teen club performance in '69, to their final blast in knebworth 10 years later.The box itself is nice, housing the two discs like a book (I expected a typical DVD case), and contains a small booklet with several descriptions and pictures for each disc.If you like led zeppelin you should get this--period. If you're trying to decide between this or some other led zeppelin movie/video collection, this is a no-brainer.My thoughts on this box set:-The editing for the MSG shows, both in visual effects and audio, are better than in The Song Remains the Same movie. The less tinny sound makes up for the lack of hd.-The half hour show in gladsaxe teen club is incredible, albeit lacking in the energy zep had later on like during the royal Albert hall."
5,Excellent compilation for this amazing band,"This product was amazing. It contained all the material you need to see if you are into Led Zeppelin. It's amazing how much you can learn just from watching a band performing. I was particularly pleased about the Danish TV performance in 1969. It is actually one of the main reasons why I bought this. You can see the band developing and how the audience changes throughout the years. In this particular performance, you can appreciate how this group of unamused teenagers soon change into a rock n' roll mood, just by watching Led Zeppelin.I would highly recommend this product. You will learn a lot from the band, both from the performances and from the interview. The quality is outstanding in my opinion (you have to take in account it was shot over 40 years ago. Definitely a must for a Led Zeppelin fan."
4,"Terrific, but a bit choppy","I am a Zeppelin fan from the mid-1970s. I saw the band live on the 1977 U.S. tour. This DVD set captures the band early in their career, at their peak in the mid-70's and in their twilight in 1980.I would prefer a complete concert from the mid-70's as opposed to the Madison Square Garden / Earl's Court / Knebworth combination offered on the second DVD, but I'll take what I can get.The highlights for me are Misty Mountain Hop the acoustic set of Goin' to California, Bon-Yur-Aur Stomp and That's The Way. Both show the band very loose and playful.Highly recommended."
5,Sweet God!!!,I just bought this last night. Incredible is all I can say. I forgot how good they where. Mix is awesome - DTS sounds great.
5,Buy this DVD Now,"This DVD is insanely good My fanefote part is the Knebworth section. Mainly because of Achillies Last Stand, but the rest of the DVD is still extreamly good. It chronicles Led Zeppelin through ten years of their career. Every song is worth watching. I purchaced it in May, and still watch it at least once a week in July.Highlights:Disk 1-We're Gonna Groove-White Summer-Moby Dick-Whole Lotta LoveDisk 2-Since I've Been Loving You-Earls Court (Acustic stuff)-Achillies Last Stand-Kashmir-Whole Lotta LoveIt's interesting to see how Led Zeppelin evolved throutht the years, and you can see it best with the two versions of Whole lotta Love. this DVD is worth Buying, and it's a deal with over 5 hours of footage"
5,The Ultimate Led Zeppelin DVD,"This DVD is a must have for the Led Zeppelin fan. This DVD is the ultimate collection of concert performances personally chosen and compiled by Jimmy Page. Enjoy the power of this band's stage presence and you too will known why Led Zeppelin has been called the greatest rock n' roll band of all time. If you buy only one Led Zeppelin release in your lifetime, this is the one. Enjoy this piece of music history as this collection covers the spectrum of live Led Zeppelin performances from the earliest days to their final tour. For those lucky enough to have attended these concerts, this DVD will bring forth rushes of adrennalin of those performances and the memories will be forever etched in your very essence. Thank you Jimmy, Robert, John Paul and Bonzo."
4,New Food Secrets of Rome,"Best take out: Sisini in Trasteverte three blocks from Ponte Cavour. Best,astounding pizza, pasta. No drinks. Busy all day and night. Friendly, fast, very cheap. Try pizza with arugula.This is not in Cheap Eats but should be.Best pasta: L'Archetta near Pantheon, on east side of Via Corso near Trevi Fountain. Magnificent spaghetti.see kosher bakery by main synagogue. Delicious baked goods-ask for 'pizza' a soft biscotti filled with crystallized fruit."
1,"Poor Quality, ill fitting","I'm a carpenter in Michigan. I need a glove that allows me to pick up a nail and manipulate it, and keep my hands warm. The reinforcing patches on the finger tips are stiff and restrictive. Also the stitching began to unravel after one day on the job. The only good thing I can say is that they are warm, except the area on the back where they leave your skin exposed. You would be better off buying two pairs of mechanics gloves for the price, and keep one pair warmed up."
1,poor stitching,"I purchase a pair of these gloves and the stitching along thumbs started to rip immediately,I do a lot of lifting of boxes for a few hours each day,In my opinion they would not last a day handling lumber.How ever for light duty they may do the job."
3,disappointing but worth reading,"I wish the book had more clarity and organization. It mixes satire with political facts, speculations with history, purely subjective judgments and prejudices with objective needs. The tone is authoritarian and rather ""macho"". However, the book is worth reading (although for many, the political scene of 1960's is at this point rather too distant to relate to) because one needs to be aware of the variety of issues facing Native Americans."
3,"Not a balanced look at mormonism, but still informative.","This is not a neutral, fair and balanced look at mormonism, but a recruitment tool. Still, it does manage to give a brief history of both the LDS history and beliefs in only 150 pages, so for the money I spent on it (1.80EUR on the LDS official website), it was worth it and I learned something from it, even though I'll obviously need to go to some other sources too to get the full picture. Recommended if you want a short introduction to mormonism at a cheap price and can overlook the fact that it's not exactly neutral."
5,dream to live!,"This Cd really gets into the being of Joy Adler's mind! Her range is remarkable. She pours out her heart and soul to sing about what so many women face every day! She has come so far and delicately touched those around her in so many ways with her words of inspiration. Her voice transports your mind to a different height of the soul. It's as if an angel has stepped into the room when you listen to her music! The rest of the world suddenly disappears! She creates a comforting peace in this unsettling world we live in!And if you are blessed enough to know her, you would certainly understand that she brings an overwhelming magic to everything around her!We know that her next release, Postcard from Pittsburgh will be even more phenomenal!"
4,A pretty and appealing mix of styles,"This 1994 album, Midnight Skye's third recording, seems to have a little of everything. From the light jazz stylings in pieces like ""The Last Dance"" and ""A New Horizon,"" to the harp and recorder in the medieval-esque ""Tales of Sherwood Forest"" and ""In the Court of the Queen,"" the results of this experimentation are a little uneven, but always lovely to hear! Because I love Midnight Skye's haunting New Age songs the best, I particularly recommend ""Enchanted Dream"" from this album."
4,I had no idea what to expect.,"To be honest, I thought these guys were already famous. However, when I got the CD, the stuff you normally get from a famous band wasn't there...fillers, a couple good songs and that's about it...not here. I was seriously impressed with the range that these guys have and overall ability. Lets just hope when they do get famous the record companies won't tame them. I like all of the songs but my favorites are ""American Gothic"", ""Mental Suicide"" and ""Rule the World""."
4,Here is what I think...,"I like the idea that all the songs are not cookie-cut to be the same, like most bands these days. You don't know what to expect next on the album. There are different types of music on this compilation to fit all of your moods, yet they manage to keep a ""haunted"" feel throughout the entire album. Fantastic work for a first album. I am looking forward to their next release."
1,Just awful,"Pooly made and VERY difficult to take on and off. We destroyed the flimsy plastic zipper on both the replacement covers we purchased, trying to get them on. NOT RECOMMENDED!"
1,"Sorry, I regret buying it.",Just some information about the street legends. Good quality paper and cover and some advertorial kind of pictures.That's all. I am very sorry but it is a wrong choice for me at least.
3,Church In the Wildwood,"This is a nice DVD, however it consists mostly of congregational singing. There are no songs perfomed by the GVB, Jake Hess, The Goodmans, Ivan Parker, etc. It is nicely arranged but lacks the quality of earlier releases by Gaither.But the moment that will steal your heart is when you hear the Peasall sisters sing ""Farther Along"". This performance alone is worth the purchase price."
5,Church in the Wildwood,"I am very happy with the video. Reminds me of the country church hymns sing. From the keep on the Sunny side to Will the circle be unbroken. The vocals are wonderful. I have been huming ""We'll soon be done with troubles and trials"".Keep on the Sunny Side, Lord, lead me on, That old-time preacher man, Heavenly Sunlight, Everybody ough to know, On the Jericho road, Farther along, Revive us again, We'll soon be done with troubles and trials. The church in the Wildwood, Jonah and the whale, When the roll is called up yonder, Take my hand, Precioius Lord/Just a closer walk with thee. On Jordan's stormey banks I stand, God on the Mountain, Will there be any stars? Wonderful words of Life, Someone to care, turn your eyes upon Jesus, and Will the circle be unbroken...God on the Mountain is a powerful message, and delivered in a strong loving way.God bless"
1,NO DOUBT WOULD BE TURNING IN THEIR GRAVES......YECH!,"I ordered a No Doubt CD and got a Karaoke CD by another group called Chart Toppers...what a take!! This is not a ""No Doubt"" CD as listed on Amazon!"
5,Thorough and comprehensive,"This is a ver thorough and comprehensive work. It traces the evolution of the bungalow back to the 1600's in India and shows how the bungalow evolved into the twetieth century house style that Americans have come to know and love. While the text is exhaustive, the photos are old reprints and in a few cases are hazy. The book adresses the evolution of this building type not so much from an architectural stancem but more from a sociological view point. This is a scholarly work that is intened for the serious student of vernacular architecture. It is not a 'stlye book' nor is it a source for decorating."
3,Molly Hatchet - 'The Essential Molly Hatchet' (Sony),"Simply,a fourteen track 'best of' compilation of the beloved southern rock band.This may sound silly,but I believe that,anymore I've more or less have lost total interest in Molly Hatchet.I mean,let's face the harsh truth,they're REALLY not Molly Hatchet without their late vocalist Danny Joe Brown.I just may need to be at a late night bash to properly enjoy this CD,which has their three biggest hits,""Bounty Hunter"",""Gator County"" and ""Flirtin' With Disaster"" along with other Hatchet goods like ""Beating The Odds"",""Bloody Reunion"" and the rocking ""Straight Shooter"".Bet the band will still carry on.Last time I'd seen them out on tour,I checked out their site and it appeared they didn't have,even ONE original member.Great music,just some sad memories here."
4,"More Danny Joe Brown, Please!","10 of the 14 tracks on this album absolutely kick ass. However, there is a run of four songs that should not have been included on a greatest hits compilation. I will let you figure out which songs I am talking about, but I will give you a hint, the original lead singer and man who came to symbolize the band was not involved in them. I'm sorry, and I do not mean to turn this negative, because I have a fondness for the Jacksonville Boys, but no song that Danny Joe Brown was not a part of should have been included here."
3,"no jukin, gotta have jukin..@","Good selection, average. Jukin City is real, and it should be there. Enough said."
2,This is not Koukl's best Work,"Greg Koukl has some really good stuff out there but this is not very good. I got Koukl's ""Abortion- Only one question"" CD with notes and it is much, much better. An excellent book on the topic is ""Politically Correct Death"" by Francis Beckwith. Beckwith's a writer Koukl teamed up with to write ""Relativism- Feet Planted Firmly in Mid-Air"", an excellent resource about the bankruptcy moral relativistic thought."
5,delicious gift,"i bought this as a gift for a coworker. the thanks i received after she opened it made me happy that i got someone ""exactly"" what they wanted for real. thanx!"
1,Better think twice about purchasing this product,"I was not satisfied with this product. The item applied a huge amount of paint when I started using it and splattered all over the dropcloth. I ended up not using it. I wrote the manufacturer about this problem, but never received a response. You are better off cutting in with a brush or an inexpensive edger brush."
3,Quick Painter sucks - but Homeright paintstick works great,I had a really good experience with the Homeright paintsticks for painting walls and ceilings. So I was surprised to find that their quick painter leaks paint. You really have to be careful not to squeeze too much paint out.We ended up using paint bruches instead.
2,Quick drip,this is not worth the money. you spend more time cleaning up the drips than painting. The trigger is very sensitive. If you have patients this might work for you.
1,Accutire Tire Gauges,I've owned several different models of Accutire tire gauges and found two constants about the quality of these gauges. The first is they all had very poor seals when measuring tire pressure. It takes quite a bit of playing around until you get a good reading. Be prepared to have an air compressor handy to replace the air that you lose. The second is the batteries die in winter. I store my pressure gauges in the glove compartment and when it gets cold in winter I have to replace the batteries and take the guage indoors to warm up. And I've tried all of the new batteries available and none work. Their gauges would be the last ones I would recommend to anyone to buy.
2,Not Helpful At All,"One would think that an ""Idiot's"" guide would be written for the newbie in the subject covered. Not this book. There are no step-by-step instructions for anything. It goes on and on at great length about the theory of web site development (in simplistic terms), and never really explains how to DO anything that Front Page or many other web page authoring tools can't do."
5,?????????????????????????????????????????????????????,"yo,i gotta love this,but...my cousin said that before i was born, he had yugioh cards,and he say the one i have right now,these cards back then were expensive. he say konami ruined yugioh???????"
1,Want to be the dragon master,"If you want to be the dragon master get Kaiba's deck well duuu!The best monster card is the Blue Eyes White Dragon.The Blue Eye has 500 more ATK points than the Dark Magican.You know 3 Blue Eyes makes the Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon ATK/4500 DEF/3800 a very rare card to get.Do not get the 3 god cards; two reasons 1 they could be fake 2 what are the odds of drawing them on the first turn. Don't get Exodia like I said what are the odds of drawing all 5 pieces on the first turn. O.K. you may think I'm crazy, but I'm not.Not only should you get Kaiba's deck there is alsoYU GI OH's STARTER DECK- you will find the Black Luster Soldier and the Dark Magican herePEGUAS'S STARTER DECK- you will find Toon World and Blue Eyes Toon Dragon hereWell I'm not going to tell you every single card in every single pack I'm going to let find out on your on.Good luck!Hope we'll meet one day.Become a master duel like me.Ohhh! before you go, become the dragon master. YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!!!!"
1,Terrible,"The deck was very dumb. After one month i practically threw it away with two dumb booster packs! (well not really i just lost it and didn't care about it IT WAS SO STUPID)The cards aren't durable, are barely fun, and are extreemeeeeeely uneducational.My favorite card: The no-eyes, no dragon"
5,its time to duel,This deck is great.The rare card it came with were blue eyes white dragon kaiser sea horse and shadow spell.I recomand you to get this deck because it will help you in math or it is just plain cool.
5,This Deck Is Cool,this deck is cool. But i dont know what they mean by the deck can vary. ex.(warrior deck) but is cool and can help you win alot of duels!
5,GREAT!! HEARING THIS FROM A GAL!!!!,This deck is awesome! Here are my favs:Blue Eyes White DragonShadow SpellChange of HeartandKaiser Sea Horse!!!I recommend this deck to every beginner!
4,"KAIBA, NOT YU-GI-OH","I searched everywhere trying to find the Kaiba starter deck. Although the item description said Kaiba, the image shows ""Yu-Gi-Oh"" starter deck. My son wanted the Kaiba and when he saw the photo he said this wasn't it. I went out on a limb and ordered it anyway based on product description. It arrived as the Kaiba as described...not as Yu-gi-oh which was pictured. I was thrilled and so was my son. Amazon needs to change the image. Very difficult card set to find...this is the only place I could find it."
2,Disappointed with this shampoo...,I got some of this stuff the other day. I must have a bad condition of Chlorine in my hair... Even the bottle says after just one wash and all your chlorine is gone. I'm at 2 washes and I still have lots of chlorine in my hair. The scent was ok. I followed with my usually Biolage and conditioner. Maybe a few more times and it will be better.
2,Does not remove all chlorine,"I swim everyday at the gym and after reading all the reviews on this product, I decided to try it. I have been using it for a week. Each time I wash my hair with UltraSwim, I make sure I really lather up and scrubb and I wash two times. The chlorine still does not come out. My hair is really thick and long so I wonder if my hair is more prone to holding the chlorine. I think it is worth trying but I do not recommend this product for everyone. I did see results from using the Neutrogena anti-residue shampoo."
4,The joy of being chlorine free.,I'm not sure if it's getting all the chlorine out but my hairstylist cannot tell I have been swimming 2-3 times a week in an indoor pool for 6 months. I have long hair that goes past my shoulder blades. I use about a dollar size amount in my hair and do be careful because it is very runny in that it will spill right out of your hand. I think you get the best results the sooner you use it after being in chlorinated water. I tried waiting until I got home but my hair doesn't feel as clean. One other thing I do to complement the product is to use the sister conditioner before and after the shampoo. What I mean is that I use the conditioner in my hair prior to getting in the pool and then when I shower after pool use I use the shampoo and then the conditioner. I have the best results doing it this way. I don't have much to compare it other than your traditional shampoos and conditioners but this is far far better and the price is good too.
5,ultraswim,"I've been using ultraswim for over 20 years and it's great if you're a swimmer in chlorine. I have dark hair so I only use it here and there but if you have toe headed children, this is a must have in the summers"
2,Too Much Information - Not a Good Read,I've read more complicated plots but this book was hard to digest simply because the author seemed to try too hard to give Holmes and Watosn an epic adventure. Unfortunately he fails to keep the reader engaged or entertained in the process.I've read more simplistic and/or ridiculous detective stories but this particular exercise gave me a headache and I lost interest before I got to the very end.
2,I would not buy again,"The seller was courteous and shipped quickly, but the product is disappointing. I ship a lot of heavy but fragile items (musical instruments) and was planning to load this tape roll into one of our tape guns and use it as the final tape on the packages. But this tape tears and shreds easily and randomly and is then difficult to find a new starting point. It was useless in the gun. So we have to very gingerly cut sections of this tape and apply it by hand in sections to the box, effectively using it like a FRAGILE label and then we tape over it with heavy duty clear tape. We would have been better off, which we ultimately did, buying a roll of FRAGILE labels and some heavy duty 3M packing tape. Packing tape is one of those items that it does not pay to buy cheap stuff, it just doesn't work. Wanted to like this product, it would have killed two birds, but it is very light duty and disappointing stuff."
5,Very Strong and works great,"Not much to really say, it is what it is. Works great and very strong. No need to worry about the post office not noticing the fragile label on it"
1,Spend the Money for a Genuine HP Toner!,"Truthfully, the best part of this transaction was the 3 day shipping that I paid for. The toner (bought for an HP 1100) was as easy to install as the OEM version, but for print ability, I'd give this toner a 1. I printed my first page in about 3 minutes after receiving it -- but the print out was covered with streaks, faded print in the center, and just plain extra toner all over the sheet. Thinking that perhaps one would have to use it a bit to clean up the print, I printed 25 more pages -- all with the exact same experience. Took the toner out of the printer and headed to Staples with it -- it's worth more in Staples Rewards for recycling than trying to print with it. Bought a real HP product while there, and that worked like a charm. Bottom Line: Spend the money on a genuine HP toner (only around $43 on Amazon) -- the extra money is so worth it. This item appeared too good to be true, and it was. It appears one gets what one pays for."
4,Toner Cartridge,I quickly received this inexpensive printer cartridge and it works like a charm. Only problem is I could not figure out how to recycle the cartridge without having to pay for shipping myself.
1,BAD PRODUCT - DON'T BUY THIS.,"It's a terrible product. It left grey streaks across every page. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I had to put one star on it, but I would not give it any."
1,Bad quality,I bought 2 of them and using 1 of them that printed out the ink was do light that can't even read the text .II should buy from other stotres or office supply store that pay little more money that make my project presentation worst for my clientsI will reconsider to buy laser tonnes cartridge from Amazon again even save some money but with this bad experience ...
3,Click Click,"Toner cartridge works in general - makes click click sounds while printing, but prints look OK. If you don't care about noise, and are ok with just OK print quality, this toner is a good deal for the money."
1,Defective Toner,"Received the product on time but it came defective, it gave me a solid black line and spread the powdered ink all over in the printer. Printer is unusable now."
1,Lazer Cartridge HP Lazerjet 1100,"The replacement cartridge I purchased for my lazer printer has ruined my printer.I am going to have to pay out additional money just to get it fixed. Need a big improvement in the QC department. The Shipping carton that contained my purchase, the sealed bag that held the cartridge was open. Not sealed like it should have been."
1,Junk,"I see the price is up to $19 now, I bought for $15 + shipping, so $24.The cartridge leaves streaks on every page printed. I left feedback earlier and it's gone... hum? I noticed there's no feedback at all on this product... hum? If my feedback sticks, I'd move on to a different vendor."
3,HPC4092A Laser Jet Cartridge,"I believe I received a defective cartridge from the vendor. It prints inconsistently and jams very often.I can put up with it. However, it is not a perfect/prime product. I should have paid full price at Office Depot.The entire cartridge came apart in two pieces. The Vendor should be banned."
1,It doesn't works.,When printing i see black line on every page. It's cheap and quality is cheap too. Do not buy it.
2,Black bar on the page,"This cartridge printed a black bar on the right side of each page. it was more than a streak, it was solid and about a third of an inch wide. Returning it was easy enough, though."
2,not her best,"I was picking this up for one song, the others were covers or not so great.She's a wonderful talent though, later collaborations with Bitchen Babes are better"
3,Not the color I expected,"The ones I got came in purple. Nowhere in the picture did it display purple. There was brown, blue, and green. I was a little thrown off. It's a dark shade, though, so I hope my man will still appreciate the valentine gift cause it won't look bad with his skin tone, but he never wear purple at all. I wish the colors in the picture weren't misleading though."
5,Not sure why I have to write something to rate it.,"It was what I ordered. If you like silk boxers, Buy them from here.Not sure what to tell you. Should I be review of the product or the seller.Both are fine."
4,"Good pot, handles too high","After scarring my hands putting out a cooking-oil fire (it's a long story) I decided I needed a TALL pot for future use, so that I wouldn't need to fill it more than halfway. This pot suits very well. When about half-full with slightly more than 2 qts oil, my Taylor thermometer is sufficiently submerged to register correctly. And being stainless steel, the pot is easy to clean.The only thing I don't like is that the handles are high enough that the anti-spatter screen can't lie flat on the top, so oil continues to spatter out when I put in the doufu/tofu (I deep-fry cut up doufu both as a snack to eat with a dipping sauce - it's delicious - and for later use in stirfrying). That's a relatively minor problem, but together with the small manufacturing imperfections (pitting in the steel) it's enough to lower my rating from a 5 to a 4."
3,OK Cable,"Inexpensive cable for 'Set and Forget' applications. If your application is mission critical or the cable gets moved a lot, get a different cable.The outside jacket is fragile and the some of the male pins were not out all the way."
3,Poor recording,Great singing undone by inept recording. Microphones were placed way too far away from the singers. It sounds like someone is singing in the basement while you're upstairs in the kitchen.
4,Bravo!,"Another excellant production of Zeffirelli; color, sets, costumes! Superb! Domingo was absolutely perfect in this role. Mitchell was so beautiful, her voice rich, haunting, poignant. Marton's voice wonderful, though I felt her makeup wasn't quite right and her acting stiff. James Levine, always a joy."
1,Horrible,"This was a terrible production of a wonderful opera. I was horrified to see what a mess the Met had made of it and poor Placido Domingo! Despite his magnificence, the production was nauseating. Don't waste your time. The production conducted by Zubin Mehta and directed by Zhang Yimou was wonderful. Granted, Sergej Larin is no Domingo, but he does a fine job (despite the fact that he's shorter than Giovanna Casolla, the Princess Turandot lol). What can I say, the Met production was a freak show and the one filmed at the Forbidden City of Beijing was beautiful. I felt cleansed after sitting through that Met trash!"
3,Turandot at the Met,"I was looking forward to Turandot at the Met with Domingo! Disappointment often follows anticipation. The set was truly outstanding, the grandeur of the era was displayed. This performance is over 20 years old; Domingo was in his prime - a tenor hunk! But the magic, the chemistry between him and Marton was lacking. The one who stole the show was Liu - Leona Mitchell. A voice of an angel, innocent and full of emotion. The entire opera lacked believability. The story itself is unbelievable, so it takes a master director to make the audience be transported to China to witness this love story. It was the first time I have even seen Calaf sing Nessum Dorma seated! He looked very uncomfortable. Marton was truly an ice goddess but even when she realized then end result, she was cold. This was also reflected in her voice."
3,Helpful,This is a very knowledge book when it is used for geneology sources...but to be honest... this can all be found online now..
4,"light, fun & funny","I gave this book 4 stars, but in my mind, it is the perfect example of 3 and 1/2 stars. The book is a quick read, and the story is light and funny. At times, however, the characters act too much like cariactures of themselves, the situations are too trite, the comments a bit too cliche. Nevertheless, I don't think the reader is supposed to take this book for more than what it is--an enjoyable, fun book with some stabs at social conventions which would bring a small grin to a contemporary Jane Austen."
4,enjoyable Read,"This is an excellent adaptation of the Jane Austen ""Persuasion"" book. I would recommend it to any Jane Austen fan. It is entertaining, with well developed characters."
4,A fan!,I had previously read the Necroscope series when they came out in original paperback and when I saw them available for my Kindle I had to have them for a good re-read!
4,An Awesome Vampire Spin,"Wow, I just finished reading it and I really love how he brought together all the elements of the first two books. I wasn't wild on the recaping but the story made up for it.I'm bit of a junky for alternate earth type stories and this one was pretty good. The story takes place eight years after Vamphyri! with Harry still searching for his wife and son.The story introduces a few new characters and brings back a few favorites, all leading to the source of all vampires.I thoroughly enjoy his spin vampire lore. It's a refreshing change to a lot of the stagnate vampire books out there. He takes you to a world where Vampires are allowed to thrive in a unique manner that compels the story along. I really enjoyed it and am actually going to pick up the next books in the series."
5,Most well conceived novel ever written.,"Like the main character, I enjoy math and like the following kinds of books: horror, spy, adventure, fantasy, science fiction and classics. Add a little macabre and I could not be happier. Go Lumley!!!"
2,Boring Howard-like fantasy,"The Necroscope is a guset star in this book. It has an interesting subplot (Perchorsk) but the main plot is: Commando visits primitive world, is mistaken for a wizard because of technology, whups the but of the local lords, saves stunning blonde and marries her when they get back. Is this up to the quality of the first books? The only highlight is the description of the Wamphyri and their aeries, two truly memorable chapters).(See my other reviews)"
3,Weakest of the Trilogy,"I really enjoyed ""Necroscope"" (a classic) and ""Vamphyri"", but this third novel was a disappointment. Most of the exiting elements occur 'offscreen' and are told second-hand; a lot of time is spent on infodumps about the history and geography of the vampire world, which weakened the drama; far too many exclamation points!!! I've heard great things about ""Deadspeak"" and ""Deadspawn"", so I will give them a try."
3,Company need to work on the straps' holders.,The straps' holders unraveled in just two weeks and I have to sew them on again. Work on the construction of the undergarment. Thanks.
2,Poor best of for an excellent band,"I am a big Stabbing Westward fan, and the two middle albums (Wither Blister Burn + Peel and Darkest Days) are among the best I own. That being said, this collection is basically an attempt by SW's *former* label to cash in on their minor success in 2002 on a new label. It's not the first and won't be the last. Needless to say, I doubt the band had much if any input into the selection of tracks, so this would be my selection (coming in at a little over 77 minutes), noting the first letter of the album in brackets:(U) Ungod (edit)(W) What Do I Have To Do(W) Why(D) Desperate Now(W) Crushing Me(U) Nothing(W) So Wrong(D) Torn Apart (album version)(D) You Complete Me(D) Save Yourself(D) Haunting Me(D) How Can I Hold On(X) So Far Away (acoustic version)(D) On Your Way Down(W) Shame(D) Waking Up Beside You(S) Television"
1,"Thank you Columbia/Sony, you've done it again","I've seen this before. Remember that band called Alice in Chains? That great ill-fated band ended up seeing repackaged greatest hits release after release thanks to their record label; Columbia/Sony. When the one time great industrial band Stabbing Westward committed the cardinal sin of going gold and not platinum with they're ""Darkest Days"" album, they were subsequently dropped from their label and found a home on Koch Records. Eventually the band broke up after the release of their fourth and final album, and now here is Columbia/Sony looking to milk whatever they can from this once great band. This ""essential"" collection collects tracks from the band's three albums for the label; ""Ungod"", ""Wither, Blister, Burn, & Peel"", and ""Darkest Days"", and mostly just contains a few fan favorite songs and the ones that radio ate up. Do yourself a favor, if your looking to get into the band check out those three albums and leave this disc as skeet shoot fodder."
5,A CD EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE,"This CD became an instant favorite of mine when added to my collection, and it remains at the top of my CD playlist. Dreams of a World is a fine addition to anyone's collection, whether you're looking for music to drive by, or background music to fuel a romantic evening. Sharon Isbin's guitar-playing can range from sweet to sorrowful as her music takes you around the world. A favorite is her interpretation of Tarrega's Recuerdos de la Alhambra. This CD is a must-have!"
2,"Overrated, indeed","Although this CD features a nicely eclectic set of songs, Sharon Isbin's performance is severely lacking. If you just want a CD of background music - hey, great, this CD will work for you.But if you're a classical guitar fan who has yet to hear Sharon Isbin (and you keep hearing about how wonderful she is) - ignore the hype. Her tone is flat and dull; her playing lifeless and mechanically arranged. I have not seen cause to listen to this since the week I bought it, and I recommend not wasting your money."
2,bad deal from price point of view: very expensive!,"This product was very expensive . I paid about $125 for 3 containers of 50 strips ea. Two days after my order was placed, there was an offer for the same product from CVS pharmacy (where I usually get these supplies from)for $63 for 2 boxes containing 2 containers ea , each container containing 50 strips ea. So, 200 strips with CVS Pharmacy were half the price of 150 strips with the Amazon sub-dealer. No complaints about the speed and condition of the delivery."
1,Pretty bad,The singing here is pretty bad. The singer cannot even control his voice properly. The songs here are also unmemorable. NOt enjoyable at all.
1,Substandard performances,"The music performances on this cd is substandard, for Aaron Kwok isn't a competent singer. His weak vocals cannot do any justice to the music, which itself is quite uninspiring. I won't recommend this cd to anyone."
5,great invention,"This is my second one because they work so well in pairs. From small ladder bracket scaffolding to an excellent plank leveler when siding or installing a window on a roof. Multiple roof pitches prove no problem. Secure grip on most surfaces. I used to make these out of plywood just 7 years ago, but these are longer lasting and safer."
4,Helpful tool,"Pretty simple device, just an angled wedge, but very helpful for working on uneven surfaces, which is just about everywhere."
5,First class accessory,"I originally borrowed a pair of these from a friend when I was painting the exterior of my house a few years ago. Since then I have borrowed them at least once every year, so I finally decided it was time to get my own! The grips on these ladder supports could not be bettered, and I've always found them to remain firm and stable under all conditions of use. They are lightweight, sturdy and entirely reliable, providing rock-solid support on every pitched roof I've used them on. I cannot recommend this product highly enough!"
4,Works well on stairs,I have been very pleased with the usability of the tool. I did not realize how useful it would prove to be when I purchased the tool. Nice and stable on stairs.
1,US-SAVER,I'm not reviewing the book I'm reviewing the seller; US-SAVER.The seller from UK provides horrible customer service.They shipped the book without the CD as stated when you buy it NEW.It took longer than the 3-5 days they say it takes to ship from the UK.I returned the book to get a new one with the CD and I still haven'treceived it. If you live in the USA don't buy abroad!
5,A Prokofiev Symphony # 1 to compete with Karajan/Berlin,"This is one of the very best Prokofiev Symphonies 1 and 5 CDs available. The wind sections sound really clear, with no senseless blunders, and also the percussion sounds picture perfect. Yes, Steve, I have to agree with you on the sound quality. The only comparison to this Symphony no. 1 reading is Karajan's(Sony DVD Telemondial). Leonard Bernstein and Eugene Ormandy are thoroughly pathetic in comparison with Gunzenhauser's or Karajan's reading of either one of those symphonies. There are other equally good readings besides those two, but go with this one."
3,A great piece paired with an OK one,"Prokofiev has two famous symphonies, number one and number five. The first one, called the ""Classical"" is probably the most famous short symphony in the Romance period. Clocking in at under 20 minutes, the four pieces of this symphony are distinct and uniquely simply; i.e. each part is one melody played by only a few instruments, and each is quite catchy in tune and easy to remember. Symphony number 5 is the opposite. It is longer, more complex, and not so memorable. Both recordings on this CD are fine. The CD itself is a great buy for the price listed in amazon."
5,better than expected,We bought these to replace a set of Faberware that we inherited from my mother (30 yrs old). These are great pans. They distribute the heat well and age great to handle.
5,Solid well built cookware,This is some nice cookware. When you pick up any of the pieces you can feel how solid it it by the weight. Cooks evenly and has soft grip handles that are cool to the touch. Glass lids are nice but don't expect to always be able to see your food cooking as they have a tendency to fog up.
2,Discoloration after the second use!,I have the stainless steel version with the glass lids. After the second washing in the diswasher the insides of these pans bacame discolored with strange blue spots and very very white smaller spots. I was shocked because I have owned several types of stainless steel pans and have never seen this kind of discoloration before. I would steer clear of these and get something else. I regret this purchase. Wolfgang Puck is a MUCH better choice.
4,"Good quality, but small","The quality of these pots is definitively good, but the problem is that there is only one decent sized pot and one decent sized skillet, all the other ones are really small. Good set if you are a single, not recommended for a family."
3,the smell,The smell of this oil reminds me of homemade rootbeer. It is a good oil but doesn't have a good smell.
4,ahead of its time,"Upon reading the other reviews of this band I got the feeling that the reviewers were saying this band was some sort of offensive and silly punk thing... like they were a joke band or something. musically, they weren't. They were totally ahead of their time... especially if you're into dirge, melvinsy, blacksabbathy type punk. FANG's music is slow, down-tuned and HEAVY. The sound is fat, fuzzy and dark. The best album in my opinion is ""landshark""... great production on all the instruments with a heavy bottom that I actually haven't heard in a long time. They were released on BonerRecords very early in the 80's and I actually think that the recording they got on this ""landshark"" album is fatter, fuller and better than later recordings of even heavier, slower bands like the MELVINS. whoever was working in the studio that day knew what they were doing. a must get."
5,the worst band ever...,"fang is by far the worst band of all time. even in a genre that by defenition means bad music (SEE: PUNK ROCK) they are the worst (though not quite as bad as the Mentors).one of my favorite bands of all time this is a must for anybody who enjoys early 80's hard core punk. Possibly the dumbest lyrics, even for a punk band (though not quite as dumb as the dayglow abortions). and if you think their music is bad, you should have seen them live...(i hear they are still around here in the bay area but 17 years later i'm sure we both have changed for the worst)."
5,Fabulous!,"This DVD is a tremendous production all the way around. Richard Strauss's Salome is simply a wonderful opera to begin with, and Teresa Stratas as Salome is simply stunning. Her voice is flawless and she is beautiful as well, able to meet the demands of the role in every way. The entire cast is superb and appropriately creepy-just amazing."
1,Performed by The Copy Cats,"The Amazon listing gives no indication that these are cover versions of the Boney M songs performed by a group called the Copy Cats. They do a passable job, but doesn't seem to have the same energy as Boney M.I recommend sticking with the original versions. Here's the track listing:Disc 11) Daddy Cool2) Hooray Hooray3) The Rivers of Babylon4) I See a Boat on the River5) Children of Paradise6) Baby Do You Wanna Bump7) Belfast8) Kalumba De Luna9) Mary's Boy Child / Oh My Lord10) I'm Born Again11) Ribbons of Blue12) Love for Sale13) My Friend Jack14) Malaika15) StoriesDisc 21) Brown Girl in the Ring2) Ma Baker3) Rasputin4) Barbarella Fortuneteller5) Sunny6) No Woman No Cry7) Painter Man8) Gotta Go Home9) El Lute10) Bahama Mama11) Motherless Child12) Nightflight to Venus13) Felicidad (Margherita)14) We Kill the World (Don't Kill the World)Made in the UK in 2007"
3,Pilly,"The product came very quickly. Except it doesn't look like the picutres. It looks like sheep fur rather than flat fleece. It is very fluffy but sheds like crazy. After the first use, there were little fuzz balls all over the carpet. I have washed it and hopefully that stops the shedding. It does come out of the dryer nice and fluffy. Overall it serves the purpose of putting a nice layer between the cold vinyl and the sheet."
2,This book doesn't deliver,"This book is quite silly. The authors crack the book up enormously, and then fail to deliver. Particularly the chapter called Demystifying Math was a huge letdown. There are no general, structured ways to think presented that will enhance your problem-solving skills, just a few hardly interesting probabilities. It's kind of annoying given how the authors praise their own book all the time. For example, they talk about some brilliant people like John von Neumann, and go on to say ""each of them knew how to think smart mathematically without having read this book. Just how this was possible we are not certain..."". Alright, they are not dead serious, but it's annoying given how ridiculous the Math chapter in fact is. And the book is packed with ""like a Mensan would"", ""Mensans love this"", Mensans love that"", ""a real Mensan would"" etc etc. I don't consider this book a total waste of money, because it doesn't cost much and there's the occasional interesting fact."
1,Myth dressed up as history,"Hmmm...so a serial killer is mythologized, with a narration provided by a warm and witty old-man, and the one who eliminates the menace from the face of the earth (Garrett) is portrayed as having to do a ""dirty job."" Throw in a few grizzled, has-been, c-list baby-boomers who have nothing else to do and still harbor hatred towards Nixon (36 years later after he resigned!), and you have mythology at its best. If you want to know the real Billy the Kid, look into the characters of people like Ted Bundy and H.H. Holmes. But if you are interested in perpetuating the myth, this movie will be right up your alley."
1,Not worth the price.,"I am not one to complain about price, but this 1800 word monograph is hardly worth buying and definitely not worth $10. Wikipedia provides the same information for free."
3,Groomer,"Having interchangeable heads is a good idea. The handle and heads are easy to clean after use. As well, they all seem to work fine. the only complaint I have is the base that holds the handle is too ""flimsy"". The charger connector has to be positioned just right and inserted in the stand just so, so as to charge the handle in that base. It's too light and is difficult to set on a countertop. It is probably easier to just plug the chord connector directly into the handle lay the handle on the countertop and bypass the base altogether."
2,It Let me down,"I quite liked this trimmer while it worked well, so I'm disappointed at how it has held up through only a little over six months. As of now the battery will hold barely any charge, if at all. It's frustrating to have it crap out on me after initially being pleased with its functions."
4,Great deal - Great Product,"I loved this grooming-trimming set.Later I found this product on the shelf in ""Linen n Things"" shop for the same price. I prefer to buy it from the Retail shop if I am paying the same price.The G290 seems to be a better/latest product in this range. I would have bought that from Amazon but it was out of stock."
3,Not for curly hair,"This would work on a back with thin straight hair. On a man with curly, thick hair, it pulls and hurts. It does have a suprising amount of juice despite running on only two AA batteries. Blade is sharp and might work well for a woman who cannot reach down to shave her legs."
5,Great Value,"In terms of money for years of use, this trimmer is the best thing I have purchased in my lifetime.I bought it about 10 years ago, for $16 (on sale) at Walmart.For $16, I expected it to last for a year or two, but it has been going strong this entire time.It's been to France, Germany, the UK, 20+ US states and Canada in this time - and has never let me down.I would recommend this trimmer to anyone who is looking for a good trimmer/ groomer.Maybe I just got the golden version of this product - but it far surpassed my expectations - especially for $16.On top of all of this, I don't treat it particularly well - I just rinse it in water when I'm done with it, and put it back on the shelf. I've never done any maintenance to it, and it continues to work perfectly."
4,great trimmer!,"I've had this for a couple of months now and ""0"" problems. All attachments work well and the self sharpening feature reall does work!"
1,NO GOOD,"This product is not suitable. It rarely keeps a charged battery after days and days of charging, and the clippers become so hot that you almost burn your face. I would not recomend this product to anyone.I am currently seeking reimburstment."
1,"Cheap, too many parts and an overwhelming presence",Didn't like the feel of this cheap set of tools. And there are a million things to store. I didn't want to give all that junk the space it needed even though it comes with a stand for holding the 18 million parts. They even send you a comb -- like I needed another one!I set the cheapo one aside and bought a Norelco T970 for about ten bucks more. Feels good: sleek and powerful. And it's one simple unit.
1,DO NOT BUY! Will Not Hold a Charge,"The charge only lasts a few minutes. Takes 24+ hours to recharge it. When it is working, it works well and the attachments are good. I would not recommend it to anyone!"
3,It's OK for the first couple months,"For the low price, this really isn't a bad set of grooming tools. The battery life is pretty good out of the box, and all of the tools work well at first. Just don't expect this to last very long. After a few months, it has gotten to the point where a full charge barely gets me through 30 seconds of trimming my beard. And the comb attachments for the trimmer are junk. One of them broke within a few weeks, and the other one is very ""jabby"" on my neck if I don't angle the trimmer just right. I won't be buying this unit again, and I wouldn't consider it a good gift by any means. But considering how cheap it was I can't complain too much."
1,Cannot recommend this,"I owned a Wahl trimmer before and decided to try out the Norelco Trimmer coz of its price. I only use the trimmer occassionally. The trimmer is nice and light, and handles the job well. Even liked the nose trimmer attachment. The battery charger however, is a piece of junk. I had followed instructions and charged the unit for the first time as indicated in the manual. I used the trimmer a couple of times after that till the charge ran out. When I tried to recharge it, it just died out. No indicator light - nothing. It looks pretty, but is anything but sturdy. I switched back to my Wahl trimmer."
4,Excellent,This suits me perfectly. Especially since I shave only once a week. It helps in reducing the number of times I have to use the razor every time I shave. It also increases the life of the razor... :)Only drawback being the working voltage. Where I come from 110VAC is non existent. Maybe they should try other alternative convertion methods. This is why 4 stars only.
3,More Chinese stuff,"Philips/Norelco trimmers have been made in Austria and Hungary for many years, but now they've succumbed to the lure of cheap Chinese manufacturing. Next it will be the shavers. This works okay, just don't like purchasing items from Communist countries."
4,Magna Cart Elite - For dog shows,"I bought this cart to haul a large folding soft dog crate and other gear into dog shows in one trip. I used it for one show so far and it worked well. It is lightweight and very easy to open. The large wheels were fairly easy to pull over grass and uneven surfaces. It folds very compact. The bottom plate is a bit to short front to back for my purposes. Not a problem once the cart is tilted but frustrating when loading multiple items of different sizes and trying to bungie it all together while the cart is upright. The other problem I encountered is the cart starts to fold up a bit on its own when loading it upright. Again, once the cart is tilted its fine and very stable."
1,"Well made, but . . .","This is a very well made hand truck. But, unless you're less than 5' tall you'll find the handle too short to make this of any use to you... and worse yet you'll curse the darn thing every time you go to use it.I'm 5' 10' tall with regular length arms and I hate using it as I'm stooped over the whole time. This is a deal-breaker for me.The large wheels are great for getting over cracks, door sills, etc. though, and it does fold up pretty flat for transport."
2,"Nice heavy duty cart, but the handle is too short.","I purchased this one and the smaller one. The handles are too short. You have to arch your back to push a load and I'm not very tall. There is one out there by the same company where the handle is 50"" high ( Tuff Max Mover ) and it folds the same way."
4,The perfect CD to facilitate quiet introspection.,"Tim Story masterfully creates music that is minimalist in structure, wistful in mood, beautifully evocative, but never sentimental. This CD transports the listener to an inner world of peaceful reflection. Unlike many new age artists who rely on instrumentation gimmicks and sound effects, Tim Story often uses only an understated piano to communicate a deeply felt message."
1,Cautionary note,"I purchased a very similar model (P25) from Norazza and wasted a tremendous amount of time (and blank DVDs). The copied disks would work on some DVD players and not others. Like most users, I assumed it was my fault. But after copying different non-commercial DVDs and testing them, it turned out that the Norazza copier did not produce disks that were compatible with some players.Unfortunately, I figured out the problem after the one-year warranty had expired. It took two emails to Norazza to get a response and there was no remedy. I threw the device in the trash this evening.Mine was an old model, and newer models are probably fine. But, if you purchase this duplicator I would immediately copy different CDs and DVDs and test them on different players. (Obviously, this device can't copy protected DVDs from your local video store-- I'm referring to movies made at home).I have no desire to discredit this company, but I think other customers should know about my experience."
1,user,"Product did not work. Repair shop said it could have been a used one, which will not work because the sensors in the machine can detect changes in the plastic material after being filled once or twice."
2,Picture does not match description.,"I own a CLP-500 by Samsung, and the waste toner cartridge is white on one side, clear on the other and has two green plugs. This is a picture of some cartridges. Who knows what you will get?"
4,Good for a small room,"I bought this heater on a Friday sale so I got a good price on it. I was looking for a small heater to warm a bathroom during Illinois winters and this has fit the bill. The heat output is great for the small room, it heats up in about 2 mins and needs to be turned down after 10 mins. The controls are not the best as mentioned in other reviews the ""on"" dial is like a kitchen timer that ticks all the time. But for the hour I need it in the mornings, it works really well."
2,Big cheap heater (not for light sleepers),PROS:1. Cheap2. Does workCONS1. Makes lots of noise even when at low setting - don;t buy if light sleeper2. bigger than most other heaters
2,Poor performance,"I had to return the product, it was defective. There was no replacement for it, so I had to settle for a refund."
1,"don't buy, save the flabergast",The temperature gauge hardly works and is very loud. I would recommend this after I would recommend a slap in the face.
1,Less than 5 hours operation and it's dead,"Bought one of these in October. I liked the fact that it had a large heat transfer area, so it should give a nice wide heat cone.That it did.What it didn't do was last.I plugged it in today, and the fan is apparently seized. It just hums, and after a few seconds begins to overheat.Judging by what I'm finding on the internet I won't have much, if any, success with Delonghi's ""warranty.""Rather disappointing, but at the same time, enlightening."
2,It's a utility fan! Loud & shaky...,"DeLonghi puts this under Ceramic Heater (instead of Utility Heater which is one of their other categories) but Lowe's calls it a Ceramic Utility Heater which is more accurate. This thing is quite loud & shaky. If you use this on a carpet, that will muffle the vibrating sound, if you use this on hard flooring, the vibrating noise may be too loud for you."
2,Bad Thermostat and Timer... A little Noisy,I purchased this heater to warm my sunroom in the winter. The heater's thermostat was defective. The heater would stay off for 20 to 30 minutes before coming again only to run for 15 seconds. I returned that heater and purchased another of the same make and model. The second heater's thermostat worked a little better but was still hard to find a setting that would keep the room from getting cold. A few days later the timer switch stopped working. I'm getting a refund and will purchase something else.
4,almost perfect,"perfect temperature settings, timer. Auto mode is a little wacky, it maintains the temperature but it turns off/on way too much - better off with the timer. Very safe! around kids/cats (no burns) but the hard plastic vibrates on hardwood flooring a lot (easily solved with anything soft such as pot holder/dishcloth)."
1,This CD deserves No Respect!!!,"I am a tremendous Rodney Dangerfield fan, so it hurts me to have to say the truth about this CD.I was looking forward to some classic Rodney Dangerfield material. What I got was unfunny and poorly recorded.It's Rodney before he tapped the well of his comic genius. The material is almost there at times, but his delivery is amateurish compared to what he eventually came to do. It's a shame because the man is so much greater than what this product shows. Avoid this CD. Buy ""No Respect"". It's also a live recording, but that's where the comparison ends. ""No Respect"" is consistently funny even after many, many listenings and the recording is much better than this very disappointing CD."
4,This is a re-titled reissue,"This album was originally released in 1966 on the Decca label as ""THE LOSER"", with a great (though small) picture of Rodney and a female companion sitting in his car while it's being towed, with a ""Just Married"" sign pasted on the side...he was doing the ""No Respect"" thing even back then! I don't know about the audio on the reissue, but on my stereo copy of the LP, Rodney's voice comes out of one channel, while the audience is isolated in the other channel, which is fairly typical of comedy albums (and stereo mixing) of that period. At times, he almost sounds more like Henny Youngman more than the Rodney we all came to know and love, but this is still pretty fun and interesting to listen to."
5,This is definitely the best conditioner I have ...,This is definitely the best conditioner I have tried. My hair is the softest it's been in years with all of the perming and coloring that I do. My split ends have stopped. I love this conditioner. I will definitely buy it on a regular basis.
4,Missionary teaches using indigenous culture,"Despite its objectionable title, he intent of the author, Church of the Brethren missionary Albert Helser, was quite advanced at the time. The founder of the missionary school in Garkida, Dr. Helser incorporated existing Bura folk wisdom in the educational curriculum for Bura children instead of only using out-of-context Western material. Therefore, each folk tale he includes begins with the lesson objectives that Helser identified and deemed important for Bura children to know."
3,Not Bad! Needs More European Talent.,"Compared to Avant-Garde 1, these films are a little on the lackluster side. Somehow the American film makers kind of missed their mark as far as using motion pictures as an art form. While a few images kept my interest, there seemed to be long pauses in between shots. It seems that the man behind the camera was trying to capture something that wasn't really there."
3,Not as good as the first one,"It's good. But not as good as the first (Avant-Garde 1). In this 2 dvd box almost all films are from the US, what makes it poorer. Still is worth buying it, if you (like me) enjoy this crazy experimental stuff. But I would prefer it with more bizarre german and french ones."
5,Better than just a film.,"I first saw this film on the television some year ago and made a cassette copy to listen to. what makes this sush powerful piece is that much is left to the visual imagination through the dialogue, music and fx that are used. This film shines through not only it its current form, but also if it were used as a radio documentary. Possibly even more powerful if listened to in the car, or with headphones late at night."
5,very enjoyable/sad..brings out lots of emotions..,I really enjoyed this DVD..It's not a movie per say...but a compilation of different stories..that all center around a common theme. The footage was nice because it was real...no cheesy reinactments..and the music was awesome and used at the right times. Worth buying if you like anything related to Vietnam or this era/time in history.
5,wow,"this movie was so awesome. it gave view points that i've never seen before in a movie. i loved it. i have not liked that many war type genred movies, but this one was absolutely great. i recommend it for all ages."
5,Sound Track,"This was one of the best and realistic war movies I have ever seen. I was speechless as I watched in Histroy Class.Does anyone no the sound tracks that were used in the movie, or to be more specific, the one at the start."
5,The Vietnam War: A Tragic American Experience,"This has to be one of the best documentaries ever made related to the Vietnam War.The brutality, the insanity of the war is revealed in letters written by the participants. The deeply moving letters are magnified by the incredible music, mostly 1960's Rock.The history of the war is also well covered.The images, the words of the victims of the war will remain with you.This film really instructs us that war results in the loss of many young lives American and Vietnamese and this loss is like a scar that never completely heals. In Washington a Wall was constructed to help heal this painful loss that many American families suffered from this most tragic American experience.This Vietnam film really brings the war home with real power.Absolutely worth seeing and experiencing."
4,"Interesting Documentary, Powerful At Times","Letters and film footage from actual soldiers and nurses who fought in Vietnam are read aloud and shown in this ""documentary."" The letters are read by famous actors and actresses.It turns out to be a sometimes-powerful moving saga of Vietnam through the eyes of those who were there but, remember, it's the filmmakers deciding what letters are read. That means you get an anti-Vietnam War bias, but it's not as blatant as one might think.There is some good footage of bombings and nothing really gross, injury-wise, to view, most likely because this was made-for-TV.The most moving part of the show was the last letter, from a mom to her son who had died 15 years earlier in Vietnam. That letter is a real tear-jerker. Overall, an excellent documentary, one of the better ones of its era."
5,"No actors, no re-enactments, nothing but the way Vietnam was","This documentary is poignant, emotional, and real. Regardless of how you felt during the War, this is the story of real soldiers' lives and the world then. Ellen Bursten's reading of the last letter - from a mother whose son was killed in Vietnam, is incredibly powerful."
4,How it was . One of the best on Vietnam I have seen so far.,One of the best on Vietnam I have seen so far. It said covered parts that I had not seen in aother documentaries on the athe war and I was there for 2 years
5,The essential recording by rock's most overlooked band,"The post-punk era was a high-water mark in rock music, and bands like Magazine, Pere Ubu, PiL and Monochrome Set remain even cooler for never having achieved the widespread popular recognition that has been poured onto important ""movements"" in this music, before or since. With Magazine, there's still this joy of discovery to be had. And what makes them simply one of the greatest rock bands of all time is that Howard Devoto's psychosexual angst has a humour and poetry that transcends that of any other lyricist in rock's darker streams, while Magazine's music still seems timeless, chunky riffs built around scratchy guitars, swirling keyboards and a solid backbeat. Devoto, McGeoch, Formula, Adamson... their Secondhand Daylight is music that is horrifyingly dark and yet strangely uplifting and life-affirming, in the best rock tradition. It dates from 1978 but sounds like it could have been made yesterday. Only better."
1,Not at all what it looks like in picture,"I purchased this by the picture what we got was junk all scratched up dull, no cut design. JUNK"
1,Telescoping Handle Cannot Be Repaired!,"I bought this for zooming between my office and classroom at the university, and it was perfect. It was so nice to bring office supplies, files, heavy dictionaries, etc... without worrying about shoulder stress from a heavy bag.I was surprised when the telescoping handle broke, and I was truly stunned when the company did not care. I offered to BUY a replacement part, but they had nothing available.I had purchased the limited edition black leather one, so it was an expensive purchase. Crop In Style just said that it was reasonable for the item to become unusable after two years.If you think the price is reasonable for a year or two, then you will like it. If you expect it to last for five or ten years or be repairable, stay away!"
2,Wheels are crap,I have only been using this for a few weeks and the wheels are so loud and coming apart. I use it for school stuff because I'm a nurse and in graduate school. Don't take it through any parking lots or your wheels will be torn to shreds and people will be able to hear you coming from all the way down the hallway.
5,Scrapbookers wonder,"Love this organizer. Tones of room for several 12X12 paper packs and scrapbooks. Great pocket space for organizing and sorting extra tools, etc. Love the pen and scissor straps on the inside flaps."
3,"Good design, but quality not quite up to snuff.","I liked the design. This was purchased as a gift for someone who, while a beginning beader, had really taken off! The product had some bent internals making it non-functional. I hope to see my sister, who received the gift, and help her resolve the deficiencies."
1,Madonna: Out On the Floor,"Do not buy this if you already have Sex Bomb or The Performance Review. You will waste your money as it is exactly the same DVD but has just been repackaged and re-titled!! There should be a law against this practice or at least one which makes it compulsory to declare a re-issued, re-packaged item. The title is totally misleading as it suggests you will be watching a DVD about Madonna the Dancer. In fact it is mainly interviews with producers, music critics etc. These are informative if you do not own any documentary type DVDs on Madonna. Otherwise forget it."
4,Texas on the Thames,"Leave it to the limeys to put together an awesome compilation of outlaw country, western swing and many other styles, all killer cuts from a wide variety of sources. You get 16 tracks, including offerings from Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Gene Clark & Carla Olson, Butch Hancock, David Halley, Junior Brown, Joe Ely, Dave Alvin, Asleep At The Wheel, Nanci Griffith and more. This was released on Demon Records (UK) in 1992 and is extremely rare."
5,This CD is good!!!,"I recently have started to like Lil' Flip over the past several months...I purchased his Leprechaun CD like last month, and I just got the 7-1-3 & Underground legend CD, too...I had heard that this CD was kinda stupid, but to my surprise it was actually better than the Leprechaun CD! I suggest that even if you dont buy a copy of this CD, then get a copy burned or something, because if you don't, then you are gonna miss out on some good a** music!!"
3,I Can't Do Dat,"The first disc has a couple of good ones and the second only one, should have listened. I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone who isn't a Lil' Flip fan. Instead I would concentrate on his other works, like I Can Do Dat, Way We Ball, Shining, HSE, What I Been Through, and I Ain't Scared. These are the songs you want to listen to. Keep up the good work Lil' Flip. Your music will be a hit, as long as you Flip."
3,ItZ Awh-right: Ain't Goin Anywhere,"The first dic ain't bad with the exception of a couple of traxs. And the second dic only got one song, I should have listened. If you a Lil flip fan buy it, if not it's not worth the five dollars."
1,My last shred of faith in humanity has been shattered.,"What's that sound?""Bing bing daaa dum dum bumba dee baaa budum bom bom bababum ba booooooooooooaaaaaa"".It's the sound of your hard-earned money being swallowed by a deformed frog.The fact that this aural monstrosity actually made it to the top of the charts in Australia and the UK has confirmed my belief that we are in fact, living on the edge of the apocalypse. Four Horsemen and all.This is the musical eqivalent of those ""Big Mouth Billy Bass"" singing fish that were all the rage just a few years ago.A suggestion for those with 20% of their brain missing who about to purchase this abomination of unmusical bilge. You'd get more enjoyment out of tossing your money into an open fire and watching it burn for several seconds, twisting and crackling. It's a waste, but it sure beats listing to a mutant frog babbling uncontrollably to bad dance tunes."
3,for what it's worth,"I thought the idea was better than the execution, but if you didn't like the frog, this should never have been on your buy list in the first place.In answer to an earlier review, the song Popcorn was done by a group called ""Hot Butter"". As far as I know, it was only released as a 45 (and I happen to have one)."
1,What the 5 Star Reviews Mean,"Whoa - an album of ringtones - therefore original music right! Therefore...... ... ... ... best album ever!!!Wrong kids, i seriously have no idea how you can listen to an hour of ringtones. They are pretty repetitive and boring. I can see your souls crying out for real music, while you're clutching straws like this album in the path of discovery. I'll do you a favour - Pink Floyd, Pain of Salvation and Meshuggah."
2,humerous but not funny-to sum it up when ring tones go wrong,i can tell its trying to be funny and humerous dosnt make me lauf thou it annoys me to death allthough when the frog wasnt famous i thought it was quite funny now everone knows his name (crazy frog) what a ****** cant he realise hes careers over well if he realises another one of these albums i will die my friend gave these to me to borrow
1,It's just plain stupid.,Just read the title.But I'm sure little 3 year olds who can barely talk would enjoy listening to bubbling sounds that can come from their mouth.
1,Just plain crap,"Mind you, I would rather listen to this then that painful Cold Play. At least there is something original in this record."
2,Upsetting Flop,"I thought this would be a great thing to have for my kids who love odd and goofy things. I had shown them the videos before and they really liked the Crazy Frog. Unfortunately this album was obviously thrown together to capitalize on the fad. The songs are pretty much just tecno remakes with his sounds sampled into them. Some are ok, but mostly flops. The packaging is even worse. It was put forward as an enhanced cd with videos and such. The only thing it did was link you to a website. I could have done that without buying the cd. Another thing I found amusing was that all over the packaging including around the outside ring of the CD in BIG BOLD letters were FBI Anti-piracy warnings. Pretty odd place to put those considering that this is pretty much nothing but a cd made from sampling other music and sounds."
3,Humor!,"If you have a sense of humor and u enjoyed the orginal mixes of these songs, whats wrong with buying this CD. Its mindless. And somedays mindless is the ticket to sanity. And thats my two cents worth."
4,Great Cardio CD,"This is a great cardio CD. Great beat; uplifting music; just long enough for a good cardio session - 35 minutes. I have purchased expensive cardio CD's but this has provided enjoyable and fun background music while I burn up 450 calories. I have used it so much that I have to buy another one. Hey, maybe I'll buy Hampton the Hamster while I'm at it.THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX PEOPLE!!!!It sounds like you all take things too serious...where's your sense of humor?"
5,Loved it!,My 5-year-old said this was his favorite birthday present this year - he listens to it every day!
5,"Great mixing, great sound, great idea","This is what music is all about, great rythms to dance to and humour. I much prefer this record to Coldplay's dismal X&Y."
1,poor,"This album has a total of 11 songs. All of them are remixed with the crazy frog doing his annoying jingles in the background. This cd is for the very young (10 or younger). I, however, would much prefer the originals to these songs. Here are the original tracks and the artists:1. We Like To Party - Vengaboys2. Get Ready For This - 2 Unlimited3. I Like To Move It - M.C. Mario (originally called ""Move It"")4. Who Let The Frog Out - Anslem Douglas (originally called ""Who Let The Dogs Out"")5. Pump Up The Jam - Technotronic6. Whoomp! (There It Is) - M.C. HammerThe above 6 songs are the originals and are a lot better than the crazy frog versions. Axel F (original music by Harold Faltermeyer) is cute, but why do they have to go and ruin perfectly good oldies?Don't waste your money on this. If you must, listen to it in the store."
1,Torture music?,I heard this CD is used in some countries as a form of torture. So don't buy it unless you support torture!
3,Okay for being cute.,"It's cute, it's catchy, it's not high art. If you're looking for a fun dance CD then this is it but the songs are a re-mix of 70s and 80s tunes with a techno twist."
4,Rockin' music,"I bought this CD for my 3 year old who loves the ""Move it, move it"" song. The version on this CD is not quite as good as the one found in the Madagascar 2 movie, but overall my son still loves it. The rest of the songs are modifications of songs you might hear on a Jock Jams CD. Some songs are slightly annoying due to the Crazy Frog noises interjected at various points, but they certainly are not as annoying as Alvin and the Chipmunks."
4,Fun music that appeals to kids and adults who are young at heart.,"I bought this CD for my kids because they loved the Crazy Frog ring tone on my phone. Not only did they love it, my elderly father loved it!"
3,Where to now,"I can't see where they are gonna go with this. I think burnout is gonna set in and the frog will feel the pain. Progression has to come from somewhere, hopefully from Comus and Miriodor."
5,TOTALLY CUTE!,"I bought this and the MN Vikings Potato Head for my son and his fiance for an engagement gift. They totally LOVED them! It's an unusual gift, however, very unique!"
1,A Rotten Book,"This book would be endurable without the text. The low point is on page 24 when ""Sarah awarded Ralph with a celebration."" The text should read, of course, Sarah rewarded Ralph with a celebration. This glaring error should have been caught by a reasonably capable editor, so perhaps this book was published without being proofread...or perhaps it was published without having been read at all. Sloppy grammar and uninspired story-construction are all too common in fiction, especially children's books, and this insipid story is an egregious example of irresponsible book publishing."
2,"Usable, but critically flawed","The plastic case is sturdy and clear -- viewing the video screen through the plastic is not a problem.There are, however, two major design flaws:1. The cutout hole for the hold button is only slightly larger than the hold button itself. Though this offers the best protection, it makes the hold button very difficult to reach, since the plastic is 3/32"" thick.2. The bottom of the case leaves a hole for the sync/charge cable. However, because of the proximity of the hinges, it's almost impossible to use the Apple-provided USB sync cable, since this cable is the locking variety with the unlock buttons on the sides of the cable plug. Once the sync cable is inserted and the lock engaged, a narrow object like a knife blade or ruler is required to disengage the cable.Because of these two faults, I cannot recommend this product. It should have been tested more before going to market."
1,it sucks,"This case sucks. Yes it's sturdy but that's about it. You cannot plug the ipod in since the hole in the bottom is not large enough to be able to release the plug-in to take it off. If you want to charge your ipod you have to take it out of the case so why even buy a case?? Though it didn't even cost me a dollar to buy this (of course plus shipping) it really makes me angry that a simple product like this one does not even fit the needs of my Ipod so I'll be buying a new case. Oh and you cannot even use it as a necklace since it bounces, it just sucks."
4,Good Read,"This book after a slow start was an entertaining, well written mystery. The characters were real, might even remind you of someone you know.""Murder of the Month"" prompted good discussions for book club."
3,A solid intro into a series,"I enjoy a good amateur detective novel. This one has a nice premise with the ""detective"" being backed up by her monthly book club.Overall, I do recommend this book. I think the series has a great deal of promise and should improve over time.The mystery was fairly easy to figure out and some of the supporting characters seem a little weak but, if the series continues, and the characters continue to develop, it should become a nice addition to the mystery series that you follow."
2,"Pretty simplistic and too ""cosy"" for me.","Liked the main character and the satiric content re the different types of murder mysteries, but wouldn't buy another one from this author."
3,Fine,"The dialogue isn't that great, but for a read for when stuck in traffic, the waiting room, etc. it's perfect."
3,It's o.k. but...,I think that it should be great for it intended use I just did not like the hard plastic covering. I would rather have the softer foam covering. It is personal as I would not want to throw it and hit someone in the head with it.
4,Aroma Therapy Oil in Tantric Massage,"I purchased the unscented 'Master Massage Oil' for the rest of the entire body. A little bit goes a long way and I am very pleased at how easily it washes off for my clients. I use the Aroma Therapy Oil over the shoulders, chest and stomach so they get the full effect of it. It has a very soothing scent that is not over powering. I will purchase again."
5,relaxing,This massage lotion was very calming and soothing. I used it on my hubby and he liked the way it felt on his skin. I was able to massage a little longer than usual. Very nice product!!!
1,If you think you are going to see a series of Crafstman houses think again,"An absolutely terrible DVD. I think two actual Craftsman houses are show ans one is only alluded to briefly from the outside with no interior shots. There are a lot of modern Craftsman ""Inspired"" homes (two or three) and the rest is advertising for modern accessories for them. Hardly any information or period eye candy at all. In no way would I say it is worth the high price being charged for it."
4,Lauper,If you are a Cyndi Lauper fan you should enjoy this cd. I got it more for nostalgic reasons... but I do like a few of her songs and they are on this cd. If you are a true fan... I imagine you would give it 5 stars.
3,Missing one of her best!,"This collection is hardly ""essential"" when it is missing one fo Cyndi's greatest... ""Hole In My Heart (That Goes All The Way To China)"" from the movie, VIBES.Though I'm sure she'd love to forget that film!"
3,So much left out...,"This could have been a great cd-but, once again, major songs were left out. Where are ""Hole In My Heart"", ""My First Night Without You"", ""What's Going On?"", ""Boy Blue"", ""I DOn't Wanna Be Your Friend"", ""Hey Now (Girls just Wanna Have Fun)"", ""You Don't Know"", ""Ballad of Cleo and Joe"".Too bad she isn't a huge star still, she should be. But thank God for BIGGER stars like Cher & Tina Turner who let Cyndi open their recent concert tours and helps keep her out there! (She's also opening for Meatloaf now too!)"
3,When You Were Mine is a bad song.,"That's right, it stinks. Bad singing, bad music. 'True colors' is not much better. However I think 'time after time' is brilliant, because it has TRUE melody and subtle singing. This is something Lauper should stick with more often. Of course ""girls just wanna have fun"" is a classic too. Sorry if I pissed anyone off but I had to express how bad 'When you were mine' is... Those flatulent horn sounds, the prefabricated beat... its BAD people. Buy an Aretha Franklin cd for real emotive singing on that order."
3,She bopped and flopped,"Cyndi Lauper was an icon of 1980's MTV generation hooray of fake importance. ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"", written by Robert Hazard as a wry comment on sexual mores was uptossed upturned and confetti celebrated as an anthem for pre-adolecent girls wanting to wear colorful clothes and kinda rebel at the same time.Cyndi had much more in mind. She was in a recored band ""Blue Angel"" that sold nothing. She found herself in finding song writers that fit her fairy tale. A classic 1980's LP/Cass/CD ""She's So Unusual"" had 4 (Four !) hits ""Girl's"", the cover of Brains' punkish ""Money Changes Everything"", the Hooter's cover of the ballad, ""Time After Time"", and the winking smirk of female masturbation, ""She Bop"". All included in this compliation. + the subllime ballad, ""True Colors"".One star docked for the inclusion of one of the worse songs ever, ""Goonies ""R"" Good Enough""."
4,Girls just wanna have fun listening to this CD,"Actually, the person who wanted this was my spouse, but it's really an enjoyable CD. I'm glad to see the Goonies music on here--that was one of my favorite songs from a hard to find soundtrack. I'd never heard ""Sisters of Avalon"" before and that's definitely a song that intrigued me."
4,Oh the memories...,What's not to love. I owned it in the 80's and wanted a little blast from the past.
4,solid well built tool.,Since only one PC router fits in the tool w/o the adapter for smaller diameter routers: it should be sold with the adapter and with an offer to discount for those who are willing to buy the very expersive (but quality) router that fits the tool. Also need to update the manual to reflect the changes in the adjusting knob. Otherwise a fine well built easy to install tool.
5,Bench Dog Pro Lift,"Exactly as described by Bench Dog in their promotional material, very accurate, easy to use, quick and easy to change bits above the table top, built to last for years of heavy use, and built in the USA."
5,Can't get better then this!,"Don't know what took me so long to get one of these!? The quality, craftsmanship, and function are great. Set-up was simple and easy as described. All of Bench Dog products are top notch equipment for any small to medium shop."
2,Minuses outweight the pluses...,"I wish I could give this product a higher rating--it seems to be an effective antivirus product, and certainly works better against spyware than Norton or Mcafee.BUT....Panda has essentially non-existent tech support, and you'll be wishing you had some support when the program keeps telling you it can't update because your username/password are wrong (even though they aren't). Or when you keep having to chase around their incredibly circuitous website trying to find an answer to seemingly simple questions.Overall, Panda 2006 is just too much hassle to set up and use, and while it seems to work OK once set up, one still is left with a nagging sense of doubt about whether it is really operating correctly full-time or not.Not exactly the comforting feeling one wants from a security package."
1,I wish I had kept Norton,"I have found panda slow to load, it asks every day for my user name and password (despite the fact that I checked the box telling it to remember the username and password). It forces me to enter the username and password over and over before it finally decides to accept it. Somehow, it has changed my browser so that I am sent all over the place, just not to the web address I entered. Even as I write this, it is asking me for my user ID, AGAIN! Oh, and the user ID they give you is some bizarre combination of letters and numbers, sometimes it cares if you do all caps, sometimes it doesn't. I only have myself to blame as when I was trying to purchase it from Panda's website, it inexplicably kept switching me to Spanish language. Maybe they stay on top of new viruses, but who cares when the software causes such headaches to begin with. Oh, and I will go back to Norton (even though they seem to miss a lot of spyware)"
1,Shuts down your internet connection!,"This product is HORRID! I loaded it, and my internet connection was shut off by it, and none of the 'trditional' way of getting it started worked. I called Panda, Microsoft (who couldnt help, as it was 3rd party software that caused my problems), Panda again, and nothing from anyone. Horrible customer service, Horrible product.Buyer Beware!!You are hereby warned!DO NOT BUY THIS AWFUL PROGRAM!!!Norton is the way to go...FOR SURE!!!"
4,"Bright Star, Bright Star, What do you see?","This book is great. It tells the Christmas story in the way that young children can understand. It is written in the style of Brown Bear, Brown Bear. The rhythm and repetition is wonderful. The pictures are beautiful. Plus in addition to the story in word and pictures there are symbols on each page that reflect a name for the Christ (ie. Bread of life, Priceless treasure, The Door...)."
3,As an AP US History textbook...,"I am now a junior in high school and this is the book I use as the main textual reference for my AP US History Class. I agree with Amanda, this book is boring. It is crammed with names of people, places and pieces of legislation that are never explained and, at times, appear to be irrelevant. I read a lot of supplementary material, but still do not have the time to familiarize myself with everything mentioned in the book. It is my opinion that some of the space in this book could have been used for better explanations of specific events rather than a place where the author could list everything (s)he knows about the time period in that BAM, BAM, BAM way."
1,keep looking for a better book,"This book was used as the text for my junior year AP history class, and it is absolutely awful. The book is extremely difficult to read because there is so much unnecessary information crammed into each section and the authors seemed more interested in simply recording facts than making a coherent assessment of history. My teachers agreed that this book is difficult, uninteresting, and poorly edited and are looking for a new text.I love history and was excited to take the AP History course but I could not focus on this book for more than five minutes without becoming sleepy and losing focus. The book does present accurate and extensive facts covering the history of the US from pre-colonization to the mid-1990's, but there has got to be a better way to learn them."
4,Engrossing book,"This book was an intense read due to the high caliber vocabulary. Although, I would give four stars because the reader is satisfied with masses of information from the American History. You will need a dictionary and alot of time but it is well worth it. As a student in High School I would recommend this to higher level students whom desire to be an entrepreneur in history. Good luck!"
2,AP US-I,"This is the textbook for my AP US I class. It is extremely boring and does things such as not name the Boston Tea Party, skip around in terms of dates, and use ridiculous language. Some of my classes favorite phrases are:flim-flamalluvial river bottomsfecund soilsallubrious climatebrow-furrowing"
4,THE BEST MEETS THE GOOD.,"BEN E KING IS GOOD WITH AWB. ""A STAR IN THE GHETTO"" IS MY FAVORITE ON THE BENNIE AND US CD."
2,Tsing Loh,"She is an energetic magazine writer, but this piece of fiction, writen 15 years ago, while touching on important and interesting subjects, lacks the fiery intelligence of her non-fiction."
1,Terrible - trite and obvious.,"I only give such a bad review because my expectations were so built up (on my copy, David Sedaris, an idol of mine, deems this book ""a riot"". It is not). I didn't have one revelation, didn't find any of the stuff she talked about interesting, and found it especially irritating how the main character (who if she tells me she's a bohemian again I may have to kill myself - why can't she leave it at the description? I will know enough by her lifestyle without her spelling it out!) was constantly in new settings and there's no lead in to how she got there. One minute she's in a new car, then she's at a black-tie affair. What? I don't remember her getting ready or discussing this event! Save your money."
4,Great Ideas and Menus,"This was a well written book though I did not realize it focused on vegetarian dishes. Still - it's all good, just may be hard to find some of the ingredients."
3,Good reference for vegetarian menu choices,"As a dietitian who deals with childhood obesity, I like the way she addresses having a snack shelf for your child. She explains ingredients well and has a chart for legume and grain cooking that I have memorized. However, having been a vegetarian for 26 years, I find the baked goods overloaded with banana.We use the granola recipe, but found Vegan Planet a better all-round recipe book."
1,Very unrealistic recipes for the average chef,The recipes in this book are very unrealistic for the average chef. The receipes are more suited for vegetarians that have more of the unusual spices in their kitchens that these receipes suggest/require. e.g. Main Course Hummas Plates (Does that sound tasty to a child ?)
3,good for driving to,This is pretty good. It has some really cool sounding tracks. Others aren't as good. PRetty much half and half. yeah.all instrumental by the way
4,I really liked this product because I have ...,"I really liked this product because I have a very dry, itchy scalp and this product seemed to work. It also made my hair very shiny, manageable, and soft (like it had moisturizer in it) which is what I have to look for in shampoos because of the dryness of my scalp. This product seemed to work better than other dandruff shampoos that I've tried because the dandruff or flakes stayed away longer and it left my hair softer."
3,Doesn't really work..,"Thought I noticed a slight reduction starting from the first day. I've used it every day now for 2 weeks, and I can rub my hand through my hair and snow falls everywhere. It helped reduce itch, but it certainly didn't get rid of my dandruff. Not really reccomended."
2,Ok slow cooker recipes- but not for entertaining,"The recipes are fine- if as many reviewers note you don't mind using processed ingredients. Those that I have tried lack sufficient seasonings. While I'll serve the recipes to my family (trying to improve their heathiness when possible), I would never consider them to be the kind of dishes to serve to guests."
2,Only cooked one or two recipes,"I love to buy cookbooks, but with the ability to get recipes online at allrecipe.com I really don't use my books anymore. It's easier to search a database and read reviews to find what I'm looking for..."
5,best crockpot cook book!,I love this cook book and am buying a second copy for a gift for my father in-law. The Entertaining variety is hard to find but I have bough 2 other fix it and forget it books for gifts for friends. I HIGHLY recommend this cookbook and use it once to twice a week. As a working mom it is a sanity-saver. During our recent move I used my crockpot and the recipes in this book extensively to feed everyone who helped and got rave reviews.
1,fix-it and forget-it recipes for entertaining,"I've ordered hundreds of books from Amazon. This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review. This is the worst cookbook I have ever read. Most of the recipes require the addition of processed food such as canned vegetables or beans. Not only does this type of processed food provide poor nutrition, it is unoriginal and uninspiring."
1,"All canned, Not fresh - FORGET IT!","None of the recipes in this book call for fresh ingredients. If you want to cook everything from a can or package then this is the book for you. Canned soups, bottled sauces, unhealthy prepackaged slop. I wouldn't serve these recipes to my children, let alone a guest. The only thing 'entertaining' about this book is that these recipes were even published. If you want to use real ingredients like fresh vegetables, actual seasonings and spices, look somewhere else. TryGlorious One-Pot Meals: A Revolutionary New Quick and Healthy Approach to Dutch-Oven Cookingby Elizabeth Yarnell."
3,Don't use it very much,"This wasn't as informative as I thought it might be. After reading it and trying a few things, I haven't used it."
3,Zeons and the Patterns of Force,"Kirk and Spock are captured on this planet of Nazis. It was pretty much standard 60's TV villians. The enemy is again...you guessed it another crazy federation captain who thought he could make the perfect society. This was also done with the episode ""Bread and Circuses"" where they were on the Gladiator planet."
2,Don't Buy this Product,"When a company does not even have the resources to sell you a product you know something is seriously wrong. An example: I tried to phone purchase a software update for my Garmin 2610. After being put on hold for over an hour I gave up. Then I tried several e-mails but only got form letter answers. Note, I was not trying to get a repair but was actually trying to make a purchase. If this is how they treat would be paying customers then you can only guess how they will treat you if, for instance, you want a repair. This is a company that one should STEER CLEAR OF. As for the product itself, many units have severe defects; most notably they fail to find satellite reception. When it does work it is ok, but one simply can't count on it to work and contacting the company is just about impossible."
1,Bad quality,"The cigarette lighter adapter (with speaker) is really bad quality, the original one worn out within 1 year, I purchased a new adapter and worn out within 6 month. Garmin need to do better."
3,Garmin 2610 GPS - Not WAAS Enabled.,"For the price of this unit, compared to competitive products, it should be WAAS enabled. It is not. Garmin says ""The 2610/2650 units were designed specifically for use within a vehicle for navigation. When used in a car, a 50 foot accuracy is usually acceptable as you should be able to see your destination from your vehicle within that range"". You decide. I took this unit back and bought the Magellan Roadmate 500. It is superior to the Garmin in every respect. Before you buy the Garmin, check out the Roadmate; you'll probably end up buying it!"
2,Not so good.,"I Bought the Garmin streetpilot 2610 and its little Annoying, I am in philadelphia and the sattlite signal will be lost for every 5 to 10 mins. and it takes around 4 mins at the initial start up. I will never want to depend on this GPS. It will take me to half a way and will lose the Sattilite connection and I will not know how to go and where to go and the only thing I can do it, wait somewhere and ask someone about the route or wait till I get Sattilet connection. I cannot give more then 2 stars and I will not suggest this device to anyone."
4,Review from New User,"I am newly moved to the East Coast and was lost without this unit. I mean lost too!!! Overall, it's a wonderful machine and a great buy. I bought mine from circuit city for about $800.00 and would buy it again in an instant. The only problems I had was in downloading the information to the unit...it was a little bit trickier than I had thought and the problem with lack of reception. I would advise getting an antenna which I am looking to order to help out with that problem."
2,Garmin 2610,"When I first bought it all I get was misleading route.I got lost more than 10 times. Not too precise in turning and very confusing route.Now, I have the Navigon 5100 which I am very happy with my purchase."
3,Problems getting started,"This is my first experience with a GPS unit. I started it up and it told me my home was in Taiwan. Also I thought the maps were already loaded (as per ad) but they are not. After calling tech support I was able to change my Home but he had me pushing about 12 buttons to do it. The book says choose route menu and push Set Home Waypoint. Problem is, the icon is not there. I did use it today for the first time and it did get me to my location but I would not recommend it to someone that has never used a GPS before. There must be an easier one out there."
5,Best of Breed,"I looked at this unit, the iQue 3600, and the Navman iCN 630 under road use conditions. All have their advantages. The Navman has a great screen and is fast, but the software is clunky. The iQue has well intergrated GPS functions and a good screen, but it is a little slow, and feels somewhat fragile.This unit seemed to get it just right for auto use. It is durable, extremely fast, accurate, and has the most intuitive software setup that I tried. Entering data is quick with the remote, and the touch screen is also pretty good. The screen while not as readable as the Navman, does a better job of displaying useful information regarding location and what is coming up. Find all the Starbuck's within a mile - No problem. Overall does what it's intended to do very well."
4,Excellent product that needs Macintosh support,"Works as advertised. Not always as intuitive user interface as I would like.Minor annoyance: Distance calculations seem ""late."" Tells you to turn in 50 feet while you are in the middle of the intersection.Major annoyance: No Macintosh support for unlocking and downloading maps to flash memory.Fits perfectly in the little dash computer space in my Toyota Prius."
1,No satellite reception after 2 year of usage,"Paid more than $600 for 2 year of usage, it was great for 1-1/2 year. After I realized the satellite signal was getting weaker, I saw more satellite drops even in the wide open area (rural area), like HWY-5. Now even for more than 10 minutes after power up, no signal at all, I updated the latest firmware, it doesn't get any signal at all. The GPS never been dropped, always put it back in the bag after usage."
5,Street Pilot 2610,All though it is older technology I replaced an identical unit because it works better on my motorcycle.
2,BEAWARE: NOT compatible with MAC,"I see in the description now that it uses PC-based software. I didn't catch that when I was researching for a GPS navigator, and I don't want other people make the same mistake as me.This GPS navigator seems like the only one that does not come with the pre-loaded map. You have to load the map to the compact flash card and the software that they provide is PC compatible only.If you have a mac computer, there is no way that you can upload the map. (well... you may use virtual PC, but who wants to go through all that hassle!)I haven't actually used the unit (since I don't have a PC), so I can't comment on how good the actual navigator is. But if you sell in north America and don't provide Mac compatible software, that's pretty lame on technical support."
1,What is the ALL FUSS ABOUT??,"I work all my life in the computer field. I bought this one after reviewing people's opinions from Amazon. All rebates are long GONE! It is priced here now the same as many other places or worst.The unit is bulky and heavy. Certainly is NOT a ""state-of-the art"" piece. Reception is weak, sensitivity is too. ""MapSource"" software is Disastrous for big cities like NYC. It doesn't get better, even when you put zip code (could point you in Brooklyn instead of Manhattan). If you are looking for ""47 West 20 st."" be ready that even Garmit's Cust. Service won't be able to help you. Creating the routs is very, very time consuming. You can read the manual all day, but won't master your skills. This Is outdated piece of equipment! It is my first GPS; I hope others are better, since you do NOT want to pay $620 and stuck with it for the next 10 years.You would be much better w/o it in NJ-NY-PA"
2,unit good-software stinks,"I purchased this unit on Sept. 23rd and by Sept. 24th Garmin had two downloads on their website to fix the bugs. I cannot download any maps from the enclosed disks. The unit itself works by talking in terms that only someone who is not lost would understand. For example: ""in two tenths of a mile turn southeast"". Hoiw is one supposed to figue out mileage and direction-speciall when lost. You cannot enter a direct address onto the unit, but give it onlt a city to find. For the price tag of $1,000 it should do a lot more and have simple software, like Mapquest. Unless you are direction savy pass it by."
1,Don't even try,I bought this one and i returned it it's so complicated and then i bought the other Garmin it is so good.
4,Excellent Navigator without ripping up the Dash,"This is the best navigator I have used. 10x's better than the StreetPilot III. Easy to use Navigation. Touch screen, remote and computer programming. Turn by turn voice and alert prompts. Comes with all the accessories. Ready to use out of the box or use the CD to get really detailed. If you want navigation but don't want to rip up the dashboard this is the one to get. It's portable, I have used it in all three of my cars.No battery power, must be plugged in car or wall. Expandable memory with compactFlash card. Get on the Garmin website for software updates. Four stars because I would have liked a bigger screen."
5,Wasted Lives and Bluegrass,"Paul Sanchez is one of those singer/songwriters who has lived his subject matter. His ability to bring those experiences to light and into the listener's life is paralleled by few. From my early days at Carrolton Station down in New Orleans, I have many fond memories of those Wasted Lives days."
3,Folksy music to listen to when you are in a thoughtful mood.,"Paul Sanchez is a talented artist that is a member of the group Cowboy Mouth. This solo work is more folksy than the groups, however, and even though the songs are best heard live with just Paul and a guitar, it is a CD that is worth buying and listening to when you are in a contemplative mood. Look for Paul's later work--Loose Parts, which is a much better CD and shows growth of his talents."
2,A disappointing Creator wannabe,"Once again, a Lego game that can't handle the size of my imagination. I was really excited when this game came out because I'd been longing for knights and castles and such in Creator. I just wanted to be able to build the coolest castles ever, that I could never build in real life because I didn't have enough pieces. But the building area in Knights' Kingdom is tiny! The only really cool thing I remember being able to do was turn a castle transparent and then paint it a different color, but have it stay transparent. So I made a ghost castle! But after that I gave up, because I couldn't make any of my ideas work in the space I had."
1,"c'mon, hot pads that melt??",These are lame. One side melts instantly on contact with a hot pan. Skip it.
1,Disappointing product,"Both pads ""burned"" on the backside the first time I used them. They are still serviceable, but the ""burned"" areas are hard. They were used in a normal kitchen--no blow torches."
1,They MELT and BURN!,"While taking a ~420 F degree baking sheet out of the oven both pads melted to the metal and left a hard, burned-on residue on the metal.These are simply not suitable for use high temperatures, which is ridiculous."
5,I love Kitchen Grips,These are really great because they are so flexible. When I'm reaching for a hot pan I want to know that I can get a good grip on it. These are fabulous. I have given them to my brother and son because they provide more safety in the kitchen.
2,mousepad as potholder,"I ordered a pair of these recently, because I liked their unique style. But they get dirty quickly, and are hard to clean. They work about as well as you would expect a couple of mousepads to work as potholders."
2,Interesting,"I am still acclimating myself to the book. It can be a little bit too wordy on some concepts that it feels overwhelming. But, I think it is still helpful for pointing out important grammar points."
2,Conversation blows,"I'm a big, big Ed McBain fan from way back, though a bit leery of the author when he puplishes under his real name. If you set aside the graphic sexuality deplicted and gratuitous profanity, there is little left in this book. The police and district attorney machinations are very routine and the relationship difficulies deplicted in the prinicipal marriage are trite. The resolution of the affair is also a bit rushed and convenient. Not one of his best works under any name."
3,Interesting premise,"Sarah is a happily married woman, her husband, Michael Welles is the Assistant D.A. in New York City heading up the division in charge of organized crime. Sarah and daughter Mollie vacation in the Caribbean and while Mollie is waterskiing, has a bad crash and is pulled out of the water by a mysterious stranger named Andrew Farrell. Andrew catches up with Sarah in New York - they both feel a magnetic sexual attraction and Sarah, for the first time in her marriage, considers having an affair.What Sarah is not aware of is that there are bugs in her gangster-lover's apartment and the walls are listening to their every move - along with her husband!"
5,AWESOME!!!!,"the two main characters, sarah and andrew, are awesome. i was sad when the book ended. i will miss them."
2,Boring... Should have been MUCH better.,"I'm a big fan of the series so that was the main reason I bought this CD. Upon listening I couldn't believe how downright BORING it is. Almost all the artists selected deliver coma-inducing performances that make you feel as dead as the corpses that Jordan dissects on the show. The album opens with the horrid interpretation of I Wanna Be Your Man by Sam Phillips (but she's a woman, so why would she sing this song? I don't get it.) and it just goes downhill from there.OK, I'll admit there are a FEW saving graces to the album. First there is a moody version of Season of the Witch, which I liked when I first heard it on the show and was glad they included here. Second there are two tracks sung by Jordan herself - actress Jill Hennessy - who has a very pleasent voice, even if the songs she sings are forgettable. And lastly the best part of the CD is the theme song to the series with its irish-techno beat."
4,Bad Show Good Soundtrack,"I have never seen this show, or do I even want to see it. The thing is the soundtrack is great. I have no idea who compiled the tracks, but a 9 minute version of ""Season of the Witch"" by Richard Thompson?! Incredible. Also Blind Faith done by Alison Krauss, Hendrix by Cassandra Wilson and Cat Stevens by the Holmes brothers are stunning as well. Soundtrack is reccomended, but the show is not. I'll stick to the simpsons thank you very much."
5,Well Worth The Money!!,"The whole CD is awesome! For me, the best part is the two songs by Jill ~ well worth the cost of the CD!! How she never got a record deal I don't know. I love that the songs aren't just remakes ~ they've been crafted to suit the show and the sometimes non-conventional voices that perform them. It's awesome ~ a must for your collection even if you don't watch the show!"
4,eclectic to the max,"This is a wonderful recording. I heard Richard Thompson playing Season of the Witch on the radio and tracked town the recording to this disc. This CD is filled with fabulous musicians doing fabulous cover versions of other fabulous artists' tunes. Not only that, most of the tunes are given a new arrangement by the performer, as well. The tunes are unique to this disc and recorded specifically for the show. My only complaint is that, taken as a whole, the set is rather ponderous. That said, each tune is a gem."
5,Goya Palmeritas,"First off, I love the Latin American section of my Shaw's Supermarket. And I love Goya products. I decided I was going to pick up a package of them (the same one as pictured on the Amazon page) and they were delicious! Perfect amount of sweetness. And not to mention is was only 69 cents... AMAZING!"
2,mostly masturbatory,"Loyd's view is honest, but terribly self-involved. He makes no effort to hide the fact that being a war correspondent is more like being a war pornographer for him, and he revels gracelessly in his own hubris and his own voyeurism. The book is not well-written enough to make up for it, and I finally gave up in disgust. If you want to read a great book on war, and being a war correspondent, read Michael Herr's ""Dispatches"". The violence and the conflict over the correspondent's position are there, but Herr writes beautifully, and with real compassion for the all of the people, soldier and civilian, who suffered so horribly in Vietnam."
4,"Bleak, Dark, Horrifying","I find some of the reviews here to be a bit too glib and detached. If ever there was an indictment of our species capacity for hatred, destruction, and cruelty, this is it. Loyd pulls no punches. His frontline descriptions of the atrocities in Bosnia and Chechnya are harrowing. Apparently some critics find the descriptions of men, women, and children being blown to bits, tortured, burned, and mutilated to be just some kind of interesting reporting, with the author's personal struggles a distraction from the main entertainment. I suppose anything can be intellectualized if you don't experience it personally, but this book is as close as I ever want to come to such unrestrained savagery. Loyd is to be commended for communicating the hard truth about ourselves so well."
4,Morality gone by . . . haunting and honest,"Author Anthony Loyd witnesses our worst evil, yet seems to struggle with moral truths. He's drawn to the darkness of war to expell personal demons. Irony, anyone? The memoir is part catharthis and holds a redemptive punch to expose how ignorance fueled another shameful chapter in history. Whatever deficiencies in the book (very few), the author makes up for in honesty. Loyd's reflections on his family, father, the monkey on his back, etc., comprise his best writing."
1,the ramblings of a hobo,"This book will not give you any information whatsoever about the conflict in the Balkans. This book is a collection of ramblings of a spoiled western european kid who spent way too much time tailgating a tragic time period and mooching off people who had nothing to give. The most interesting part of the book is when the author adopts a stray dog and the dog eats his neighbor's chickens, and the neighbor wants to shoot the dog and the author gets really mad."
4,Fact is stranger than fiction,"This account of the conflict in Eastern Europe is proof that fact can be more awful and hard hitting than fiction. The fact that the author when witnessing some of the most bloodthirsty battles of our times is always a hop, skip and a jump away from a clean hotel room in a peaceful country makes it even more poignant. This book is a must read for anybody interested in European history and the fact that conflicts with origins hundreds of years old are still being fought today."
4,Honest and raw,Very enlightening accounts of wars (Bosnia and Chechnya) that haven't got enough attention in the US. Much of the book deals with the author's drug addiction and his relationship with his father. I wanted more war stories but I found the other things surprisingly interesting as well.
2,"Sorry, I am not loaded","A messed up report of a messed up war by one very messed up dude. Sounds more like a drug log than any reporting. The haze of drug abuse makes the atrocities reported more like a drug dream, remote that is, than any reality. Found the book incoherent. For a more coherent report read ""Love Thy Neighbors"" by Peter Maass."
5,"This is a great book, this is grassroots change at its best.",Well written and rather nonbiased on the success and failure of the project. Would recommend to anyone.
2,Lacks cohesive subject and audience,"I picked up this book hoping to find an interesting story that would also teach me a solid background in microlending. Unfortunately I didn't find enough of either in ""Banker to the Poor.""The author lacks a focus in both his material and his audience. For example, if the book is about Grameen Bank, it could do without the opening sections of scattered bits of Yunus's life.I also feel I could have learned more about microlending in a lengthy Economist article than from this book, especially when it comes to some of the challenges or downsides to microlending. The book leaves basic questions frustratingly unmentioned, much less unanswered (e.g. what role does *savings* have, or not have, in reducing poverty?).Yunus offers almost no criticism of Grameen or microlending in the book, which makes for very odd reading, when for example he has a chapter on ""Grameen Bank 2"" -- if there was not much wrong with Grameen Bank 1, why the complete overhaul for Grameen Bank 2?"
5,Bank to the Poor is A MUST READ,This book helped me to decide that I wanted to go into Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) and is a must read for anyone who is thinking of a career in Social Change/Sustainability.
3,a book you should read,"you should read this book not because its exceptionally well written, because it is only competently written. You should read it because it is written by a man who has challenged our business model of helping the poor (and make no mistake, helping the poor is a business model more than a charity model)>There is a reason these ideas rated a Nobel Peace prize, and reading about the thoughts and ideas in the firsst person is more powerful than others' interpretations.So read it to learn, and to expand your thinking."
3,A Mission Worthy of the Nobel Prize,I enjoyed Muhammad Yunus's story about the formation of Grameen Bank but it did begin to drag a bit at the end. Not that the story grew less noble with the telling but because it became a repetition of the same story as the concept of micro-lending to the poor was applied to other countries. Yunus deserves so much praise for the idea and making it happen. As much as anything this is a story of overcoming the odds and one man's commitment to an idea.
3,"Should be title ""How I succeeded as banker to the poor""","There is no doubt that the author seems to have done a lot of hopeless people a great service. However, this book really struck me as being more about him, why he is so amazing, and how he repeatedly overcame odds dealing with short-sighted, ignorant, selfish bankers doing things the traditional way. The book would have appealed to me a lot more if he had gone further in explaining why traditional methods failed but were maintained. Also, there was very little frank discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of microfinance. Sounds like maybe I should have read the Wilson Quarterly article instead.The book was a repetitive sales pitch and could have been a lot more."
5,Inspiring,"Consulting to the banking industry, I always admire those who find innovative approaches to building profitable financial services businesses serving the poor and unbanked. There are great examples in South Africa and the US. The Grameen story is so inspiring. It provides a ray of hope to the world's impoverished and, by extension, to the entire world."
4,Inspirational,Mr. Yunus is truly an amazing person and this book shows how one person can make a difference in the lives of many. After reading this book world poverty is something that does not need to exist.
3,Cheerleading versus Critique,"Muhammed Yunus' book and Microfinance: the Way of Grassroots Finance are all well and good if you want to read the equivalent of cheerleading for the microfinance movement (both books seem targeted at a high school level audience, by the way), but if you want a serious and more academic oriented critique of microfinance, you should check out Lamia Karim's Microfinance and Its Discontents: Women in Debt in Bangladesh. While Banker to the Poor presents an upbeat narrative on the social business model, in general, and microfinance, in particular, without reference to the potential negative consequences of these ""bootstrap"" models, Karim takes these negative consequences seriously, providing clear empirical evidence from Yunus' Bangladesh for being far more cautious in placing this model at the forefront of attempts at economic development."
4,Creativity from below : Muhammad Yunus,Yunus with his Grameen Bank initiative has brought a new notion that the bank can be truly too at the total dedication to the poor not just the rich one. Rural poor women are changing the face of the family situation through this initiative of Grameen Bank that not only bring micro-credit to poor people but also keep introducing new opportunities and creative assets for quenching poverty.
3,Straight from the Founder,"If you are interested in microfinance, this book is a prerequisite. Dr. Yunus gives a historical account of the rise of micro-credit and the Grameen Bank. Of course, he is also the biggest advocate of the program. Therefore, most of his arguments are pro-expansion of micro-credit. In spite of this, he manages to show a clear and compelling picture of the micro-finance industry. But, make sure you balance the information with other microfinance books that does not proselytize as much. A good example is ""Beyond Micro-Credit"" by Thomas Fisher."
4,Practical help,"I can only agree with the other reviews of this book, but I would like to add that anyone who appreciates what Yunus has done might also read 'The Mystery of Capitalism' by Hernando de Soto. Both de Soto and Yunus underline the importance of using market-based mechanisms to alleviate poverty at the grass-roots level (de Soto suggests giving squatters and illegal workers legal title to the land they occupy and the goods they have so they can use them as collateral to raise capital and receive infrastructure). P.J. O'Rourke makes the same point in several places, but he is writing from a quasi-comedic point of view.If the past 25 years of history has been about anything, it is about the bankruptcy of the command economy. Warts and all, market-based solutions are the only way forward. The ideas of Yunus and de Soto are, above all, practical - which is probably why policymakers will overlook them in favour of big-money projects, grand pronouncements, and other things that don't work."
4,Its a great book!!,"It is a good read, and a powerful reflection of some of the faults of our modern day financial system. The depicted ideas are begining to spread in the corporate world. And the most significantly felt i think, would be Ebay's recent move into the Microfinance industry. Hopefully, this is just the start!!"
5,you ain't seen nothing like this!,"this book is truely awe-inspiring! one gets hypnotized looking at the pictures, thinking, ""i've got all that going on inside me--right now!"" the visuals are so fantanstic and yet so truly real that they urge you to seriously reconsider your relationship with yourself. this book is a statement on the miracle that you are. it gives you a very deep sense of respect for your own heart and your own life. anyone who has a heart will fall in love with this one!"
3,Nice pictures,"Call this book Healthy Heart 101. The pictures are spectacular. The prose is basic, which isn't all bad. I consider this a decent reference book."
4,A history of an important scientific study,"Well written and easy to read. But the book is primarily a history of one satellite study of background radiation. The book is heavy on the history and interaction of the scientists (which is very interesting), but is light on explaining what they found and how what they found increased our knowledge about the beginnings of our universe. I was a little disappointed with lack of an attempt to explain the science. For example, the book hypes the fact that the universe is 13.7 billion years old, but does not tell how they arrived at this number. The books says the universe is 23% dark matter, but does not explain where this number comes from. Still I recommend the book for a good picture of how science is conducted. And I should mention that two of the scientists in the story won the 2006 Nobel Prize in physics for this study."
1,"Ian ""Ogre Battle"" Osborne? I don't think so","It's hard to put into the words the disappointment I felt when I received this ""strategy guide."" Tactics Ogre is a complicated game that requires alot more than 96 pages of worthless information. Ian Osborne should keep far away from writing strategy guides if this is the best he can do (personally I wasn't impressed by his Ogre Battle guide either) and if anyone's thinking of purchasing this guide, DON'T. It's a waste of money. It's a crying shame that Prima put their name on this...apparently they don't care too much about the Ogre Battle series to let such sub standard guides out for it."
1,A waste of money,"The guide did not cover all of the plots, including Hell's Gate. I received better information from the FAQs on the internet. It was very frustrating to use."
2,Disappointing,Maybe I was expecting more from a DVD but this is a total waste. Very boring and too little info given for the price. Buy a cheap book on dowsing and you'll be better off and more informed. Use the money saved to buy dowsing tools.
5,CLAIM! Is exactly as the title states,"I have watched CLAIM about 8 times now. I got it when I bought my new ARMADA skis. I have seen dozens of ski videos over the years. This is by far my favorite. Any movie that opens with The Final Countdown by Europe cant be bad. Big time skiers doing BIG MOUNTAIN lines BIG MOUNTAIN tricks and stomping them. Don't hesitate, buy this today"
4,Para quem gosta de ski,Um dos melhores filmes de ski que eu já vi. Para quem gosta de ver ao. Entrevistas curtas. Sem muita enrolao sobre os lugares. Algumas decidas so realmente impressionantes.
1,Not Impressed,"I was extremely disappointed with this movie. I was so pumped when I finally got the self proclaimed best ski movie of all time in the mail. But after watching it I feel ripped off. It was just ok. Another Matchstick movie, Focused, blows Claim out of the water. There was to much theatrics and other than ""Final Countdown"" the music was all over the place and no where near as good as Focused. I would highly suggest avoiding this one. I would suggest, buying Focused for sure and TGR's Anomaly."
3,ok...yeah...um.hum..i see,i havent reAD it yet But IT soUnds LIKE A good BOOK lol ALL my friends LIKED IT so i thought I MIGHT HVAE look see and find it AND BUT it lOL
5,Excellent,"Small summary of 46 minutes of the magnificent musics consisted by talented Michiari Watanabe.Small precision : the tracks 4, 6 and 11 which contain 3 titles of Akira Kushida have here all their importance because these were inexplicably channel-flicked on the double cd Japanese taken out in 2006. In other words, these 3 titles are today collector's.For all the fans of ""Sharivan"", this collector's item is to be absolutely possessed."
3,money maker! be careful!,"I'm a big fan of Deep Purple, since the end of the 70's! I collected all of their albums! so do not get me wrong that I give this SACD only 3 stars! because the cd is a new reissue of LIVE In CONCERT 1970 - 1972 which had been released on vinyl for 18 years ago. And there is one thing you have to pay your attention is, that all Deep Purple reissue CD's are the marketing money maker strategy that the fans should really hate!The songs are digital remastered, but not different than the old Vinyl release in 1981."
4,Good product,"Selsun Blue is one of the few (maybe the only?) shampoos that contains Selenium Sulfide (1% solution) that is helpful in controlling the skin condition Tenia Versicula. You need prescription strength of Selenium Sulfide (2%) to actually completely relieve the symptoms of this condition(also not a cure). But, at least, Selsun Blue seems to somewhat hold the symptoms in check, until you can get your prescription filled.This one of the Selsun Blue line (Normal to Oily) is good for those of us with an oily scalp."
1,Failed after 3 months,This Mexican made part only lasted 3 months. I paid extra for the AC-Delco name. My mistake. I'm off to go get the $10 Chinese made part from my local auto parts store. I bet I'll have no problems with that one...
4,"Also Consider Crazy 8's ""Big Live Nut Pack!""","I'm a big fan of Fishbone, and I really like this album. However, I just realized that another favorite band, The CRAZY 8'S (now defunct) would be popular with Fishboners. If you like OINGO BOINGO and FISHBONE, you'll LOVE The Crazy 8's! (...especially ""Big Live Nut Pack!"")"
4,Install Issues,"This switch comes without instructions and the Leviton web site provides no help in wiring it. So after much frustration and hopeless web searches, my wife stumbled upon an Amazon rating for a similar product that explained how to wire it. I followed those instructions and it works great now. Here they are (and of course I'm not an electrician):1) Hot power (black wire) goes to the black screw on the lower right.2) Out power (black wire) to the light goes on the brass screw on the upper right.3) Both negative (white) wires go on the silver screw on the upper left.You may have trouble figuring out which black wire is the hot power wire. If you wire the switch and the switch stays lit even when off, you have the two black wires reversed. Fix that and you'll be good to go.Switch works great and deserves 5 stars but for the crappy instructions and web site."
1,Manufacturing Defects,"I have been shipped 3 of these planers by Amazon. On the first one, the adjustable (forward) part of the base was not square with the blades and fixed base. This resulted in an inability to make even cuts. I sent it back. The second one had exactly the same problem. The third one, which was supposedly checked by Amazon before being sent, was not quite as bad but still off. I took it to the Dewalt service center. They still have it. While this planer looks good on paper because of its power and features, like many DeWalt items it is overpriced. It is also apparently poorly manufactured. Even if they correct the problem you have to wonder about the quality control process. The dust bag is also a little strange and overpriced. I am tired of making trips to the post office, service center, e-mail site and etc. Pick another brand and buy it in person."
1,Addendum to review,The DeWalt service center finally called. They ordered me yet another planer. It had the same problem. There are apparently significant quality control problems with this unit which is made in Germany for DeWalt. They suggest getting a different DeWalt planer.
4,Monumental book on the history of chess,"This book is a reprint of Murrays monumental work, firstpublished in 1913. Murray is a scientist, and his writingshows this: we have discussions about legibility of manuscripts,theories of the spreading of chess, etc.What we find in all this is a thorough and precise account ofhow chess came into existence, and has spread over the world.Where many books on the history of chess are best in describingthe modern history, this book is best in telling about the roots.Also, we find hunderds of historic chess puzzles.If you really want to know how the origins of the bestgame there is are, then read this book."
5,This book is great if you want a more challenging beginner's textbook!,"I'm fairly good at picking up foreign vocabulary and grammar, and so I dislike Spanish textbooks that move too slowly and contain exercises that are exceedingly easy and simplistic. This book doesn't waste the first five chapters teaching you pronouns and numbers. It jumps right into verb conjugation and grammar, and demands that you look up any missing background knowledge that is required for its in-chapter exercises. (For example, I had to go back and review Spanish numbers on the internet.)It's a well-written, challenging book. Its vocabulary is very modern and up-to-date (you learn how to say ""text message"" in chapter 1.) It has creative, well-written exercises, and LOTS of them in each chapter."
4,Edifying exercise book,"This book has no cartoons, to its credit. The areas of language it addresses are useful and clarifications are good. Students get it. No lengthy explanations--just review--as the book claims. For the student seriously wanting to get it right, and keep away clear of pitfalls, this works. I teach adults privately using this review, and when the answers in the book aren't enough, I hatch a lesson based on how well the exercises were navigated. Right now I like the rate of progress and achievement."
5,Strictly grammar.,"An excellent reference. Answers in the back and a CD. It is very specific, and must be studied to be appreciated. This is not meant for easy learning."
3,"Excellent, concise explanations; however, many errors in Kindle edition","This is a fantastic book for learning the grammar of Spanish. The book is straight to the point and lays out clear rules and exceptions.However, the kindle edition has many errors with the example sentences (which are key to understanding the rules). The example sentences are often displayed in the content as images (in the physical book they are in two-column tables). However, often times these example sentences are malformed and displayed as a broken HTML image tag: 698,54(150,150)"" alt=""Image"" >. Therefore, many of the rules cannot be fully understood because the following example sentences are missing.The authors are great. The publisher was sloppy with the e-book, and should fix all the image errors and republish."
3,Extra Practice,"I like this product because I use it as extra practice and supplementary material to some other materials. The explanations are not as thorough as I would like, but the exercises are useful."
5,MAGAZINE-THE CORRECT USE OF SOAP,"Any poor sap that missed this one in 1980(!) should be tripping over themselves to fetch a remastered copy of this new wave masterpiece-as good as it gets. when i think of this era of music i always immediately think of this album. why the album color is not white like the original is beyond me...buy this now, then buy all of their other releases."
5,Magazine's flag-waver,"Devoto and company originally intended this material to be released as a series of five singles (A and B sides) and not as an album (before the record label nixed the idea), so the slightly brighter, more accessible arrangements than those that the band deployed on Secondhand Daylight or Real Life may have reflected that. Even the lyrics on Correct Use of Soap seem somehow more pub(l)ic or political than the personal psychodrama reflected in Secondhand Daylight. In any event, this is one of those albums, like Elvis Costello's first, or The Pretenders debut, that plays like it's already a greatest hits package, with ""Song from Under the Floorboards"" a standout. A monumental achievement, musically and lyrically."
5,"Very insightful, a must read for all!","This book by Dave Hunt shows the kind of truth through research and un-biased insight into the Middle East that is hard to find. It is an easy read, well thought out, well researched, and helped this reader to fully understand the delicate relationship that the Jews have been forced to balance in the past, present, and will in the future. Their plight is truly amazing. It is worth a great deal of attention and study for anyone interested in understanding the truth about what the Holy Bible says about God's chosen people, the Jews, and their God given right to Israel."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Am starting to think I made a mistake buying the travelmate 300. In turn, and since I purchased the machine 6 weeks ago, I have had problems with sticky keys, a cursor that dashes around the screen and, as of last week, a screen that has gone black. Reading through the Acer newsgroups, it appears that many other people have had these and other serious problems. Customer support is friendly but seems unwilling to recognize the very large number of Acer Travelmate users facing similar problems to my own. It is taking ages to get my machine's screen fixed."
1,acer do not buy not worth even 1 star,"I to sadly bought an acer 1360 travel mate. The paint wore off it in just two weeks it was replaced 4 times and wore off after 2 weeks. Acer then said it was wear and tear yeah right a touch pad you cannot touch?? go figure. Now they refuse to do anymore saying i have abrasive fingers or have too much sweat etc etc . DO NOT BUY ANY ACER NOTEBOOK, their service is diabolical it took them 1 month to replace the plastic parts, they lost the box on one occasion on another it came back with the rubber feet missing and the last time with a rubber cover on a screw missing.I REPEAT DO NOT BUY ANY ACER LAPTOPS. Their final advice to me was ""well you should have bought a more expensive model"" because this was only a cheapy 650-$1200 !!!!!!!!!! yeah so they put on 1 extra coat of paint on and it lasts 3 weeks instead of 2! AVOID THEM AT ALL COSTS RUBBISH PRODUCT RUBBISH SERVICE WELL DONE ACER!!"
5,Respond to Mr. William McMullin,"Dear William McMullin,It seems to me that you've bought a lot of laptops within a few months, say, two toshiba, and perhaps 7 acer?Have you got any problems with acer, or you are just another jerk from a different laptop company?I got my travelmate 230 3 years ago, it works fine to me, notflawless, but better than acceptable."
5,"Great show, dont know what ""love it"" was thinking","This show is hilarious. Apparently HungSeatleGuy thinks this is a reality show, LOL. Lil' Bush Rules!!!"
5,Nice,Blade is easily changeable and handle is strong. Great buy but I guess I got the last one here. Highly recommended.
5,Best utility hand saw I've ever owned,This is fantastic to be able to use the same blades as my sawzall. I've used it for a lot of quick cuts including pruning. And it is so easy to change the blade with just a twist. Now one of my favorite tools.
4,Great Fun!,My 4 year old son loves this helmet. It has a visor that comes down and opens and also a headset which has a recording. The only thing is my two year old got a hold of it and took out the padding inside the helmet. Made for maybe 3 and up.
3,Astronaut helmet with sounds for 4yo boy,"We bought this for our 4yo son, who is a bit hard on his toys. In less than 2 weeks (more like 2 days) he has broken the mechanism that automatically opens the visor. He loves the buttons, sounds, and overall he likes the helmet, but for a 4yo it is a bit big/bulky for his body. He does like it, but it is not his first toy of choice, nor even his first costume/dress up piece. He says it is good, and when he's wearing it he enjoys flying around the house. Bang for the buck, maybe not at four, but it is a good fun item."
4,nnice but big.,MMy son loves it. But we had to pad it out to make it fit. It is big enough for an adult.
1,Broken Out of the Box,"My son just received this. The only good thing I can say about it is that it is a good hard plastic. Other than that... it was broken out of the box. There is a warning in the box that if you manually open the visor it will cause the button to stop working. Well, ours never worked. The helmet is HUGE. The manufacturer suggests adding padding to make it fit. For a $50 toy, which is very large for the recommended ages, it could have come with a little padding like bike helmets do.Now my son is throwing a fit that we are returning his new toy. Thanks..."
5,"So good, I bought more.","My friend and I found a broken one of these at a thrift store for $2. By broken, I mean nothing happened when you pressed any buttons. We were going to a paint party rave that night and were amazed at the costume piece we had found. The helmet was a huge hit at the party. Everyone wanted to wear it. At the end of the night, the owner of the club took it because it was so cool. Which means we no longer had a helmet. I just bought two more for a paint party this weekend. Hopefully no one takes them, because this is getting expensive. The point of this story is that this thing fits adults, is fun, and is enjoyable even if broken. The visor opens to allow you to breathe more easily, which is great. Buy this."
1,Broken within a month.,"My son loves astronauts--so, we got this helmet to go along with his astronaut costume. Within a month it had split in the middle and was unable to be fixed. Disappointing considering the cost."
1,piece of junk,"awful toy, didn't work and was so big it was even too big formy husband. Don't buy it, I returned it, but wasted 18 dollars on shipping!"
3,Exciting yet breakable,"My nephew absolutely loved this helmet! However, his parents and I were quite disappointed when he went to reach for the microphone and shield and both broke off pretty easile right out of the box......I think SuperGlue may have helped but we're still disappointed with the durability."
3,Neat,The helmet was really neat but lacking in quality a bit. The sounds only worked for about 2 months and the visor fell off the first time it was dropped. We could put the visor back on but it was very loose and kept falling off from running with it on.
3,Cute but pricey,"The helmet, though really needed to complete the costume, is very large for a child's head. I can wear it. However, if it were smaller it would have been too difficult for kids to get off and on. I think if you just padded the inside, which I will try, they will get it on and off just as easy but also wear it more comfortably. Maybe the company could include such an offer since the helmet is already very pricey."
2,Not worth the money :(,It is not worth the money... Sound is muffled through a cheap speaker. The visor is cheap and falls off easy. Wouldnt buy it again.... Diffently cheap! Not worth it!
3,It's OK but the size is too big!!!,Got it for my 5 years old son. It's functioning OK but it's size is HUGE and make is cumbersome.
2,"The visor doesn""t work","My grandson was so excited to get this. We unpacked it and read the directions. My husband checked out the mechanics and checked the button to hear the talking from space control and that worked. Then he checked the button which controls the visor to go up and down. It went up but not down now its stuck. He opened the battery compartment and moved the batteries around but still nothing.....we are very disappointed. We will try to get new batteries. We can't return because my 5 yr old grandson, in his excitement to receive, smashed the empty box up. I wouldn't recommend this item."
2,Not really a toy,"This helmet is durable, but is too heavy and large for a child to enjoy. I would think that most children put it in their room on display...since they must enjoy space related items. Don't purchase this helmet if your child wants to run around and pretend to be an astronaut......."
4,4th Grade Presentation,Grandson did a presentation on Indiana native Dr. David Wolf. The helmet was used in the talk and related to Dr. Wolf's space walks.
4,Large but very nice,"I got this for my grandson's 4th birthday. He's very interested in space and wanted a helmet. This one is super cool but very large. His grandfather could also wear it with ease. They suggest padding it with foam, so we'll try that. But he was wearing it around and having fun opening and closing the visor at his party. Could hardly get him to take it off. He wants it for Halloween, and combined with the orange space suit, he should look very authentic."
5,Great Costume Piece!,"I bought this helmet hoping that it would be big enough to fit an adult. I was pleasantly surprised when it was big enough to wear comfortably! While there is no headband or suspension, the inside is padded with foam, and the whole thing is light enough that it was very comfortable.Any helmet can get stuffy to wear, but the front visor opens up so much that it is very easy to breath, and you could wear this for hours. The electronics are an inside speaker that repeats the same sequence, and the microphone doesn't work, but the overall look is so good that it doesn't matter.I plan on putting together an astronaut suit for this, and it would be a perfect outfit for Halloween parties!"
1,Not a good value,"This is more of a costume item for an adult or older child than a toy for a young child. There are only two working buttons, one to open the visor and one that repeats a single message through a crackly speaker. There is some padding on the top, but not enough. The manufacturer acknowleges this by including a note suggesting that more padding be added. Overall not a good value at all for the price."
1,Broken before using,"Jr. Astronaut Helmet with soundsThe face shield would not stay closed right after I got it out of the box, and I did not try to open the face shield manually...as the warning in the box says that will break it. It was already broken. Of course, this is a foolish design anyway for child use, as a child will forget and try to open it manually. It's bound to break soon ..as you can see by other reviews, this has happened to several. And the replacement batteries are not normal batteries, nor are they located where the illustration says on the box. I don't know if replacing the batteries will help the face shield work...haven't gotten to a Radio Shack yet to find the specialty batteries. Very disappointing! Haven't even given to the kids yet. I wish I had read all the other reviews before buying. Since I also bought the space suit, I'm not sure what to do with the broken helmet. Expensive to ship back."
4,Great Pretend Play!,"My 4- and 2-yr old boys both love to play Astronauts. They gear up in their costumes and pretend to drive spaceships! They were so excited about these helmets that they wore them for a good part of Christmas Day, and several times after. The visor/shield goes up and down making it seem ""real"". There are also sounds that play in the headset, but my kids were most thrilled with the working visor/shield. The only drawbacks are that the helmet is generously sized...so quite big on children under 5. Also, the box says to only open the visor with the button - but young kids instinctively want to push it up with their hands. Although the instructions clearly say this will cause the visor to malfunction - ours hasn't broken yet (and it has been opened by hand more than once already). We got ours on a special for $18."
2,Jr. Astronaut Helmet,"I bought this for my 5 year old son and it was way too big for him. In fact, it was a little big on me. I was expecting more out of the helmet and was disappointed that the noise it did make was muffled and hard to hear. I would not recommend this for children."
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this item online (from MMPLiving through Amazon) few months ago as a gift on my son's birthday. The product arrived on time and looked like the one on the picture; however, I made the mistake of not taking it out of the package and check the functionality right then. Later I found that the sound did not work and it was a big disappointment. The front visor functionality worked though. I remember when I bought this item from a local store few years ago for my nephew, the sound worked well and the product was a lot of fun for him."
2,Poor fitting - expensive,"Got these for my kids Halloween costume. They definitely look cool and my kids were really excited. However, they don't fit well and my kids really didn't end up wearing them. They are so look on their heads, basically just sit on their shoulders, and they are expensive. I don't think they were worth the money. The do look good in the Halloween pictures but no real play value because the kids don't like to wear them."
1,Not very good for kids,"We bought this as part of our son's Halloween costume. The product is called Jr, but I have to wonder what size of child they are talking about. It is HUGE. Our son had to hold onto it to keep it on his head. Honestly it was like he had a huge bowl on top of his head. You have to put some serious padding in there and redesign the inside to get it to work properly. My husband and I both tried it on our head and it was still too big. The buttons and sound work, but not really well. For the price, it think it would be better to just create one out of paper mache."
5,for kids of all ages,"This helmet is HUGE. Big enough for an adult male to wear ... and he did. For kids, just pad with a hand towel or something. My son wore it and just held the fronts so he could see out."
5,Great big Head for Little Astronaut,"So much fun to see our 2 1/2 year old grandson in his one piece fuzzy PJ's run around with this huge helmet. He certainly looked like an alien from the 60 and 70's. He loved it even if he could not quite reach the buttons, it is sized for a larger child (ages 3+) but with help we managed. There is not a lot of rocketship stuff for that age so ordered it knowing it would probably be too big. Appears to be solidly constructed. I appreciate the volume of the countdown, it is not too loud."
2,Big and flimsy,"My son has really been wanting this, and he says he's OK with it, but it's been sitting on the shelf since he got it. The mike broke off when he tried to rotate it. It's on a thing that looks like it should rotate, but it doesn't, so now there's no mike.The whole thing is big, clumsy and just not designed with kids in mind."
2,overpriced and breaks easily,"My son likes the idea of having an astronaut helmet, but it is so poorly made and low tech that it does not come close to warranting the high price. The face shield broke on the first use. It's a very poor value."
1,Work ? Gloves,Nice fit and style.I was pleased until I wore them to work.After 1 day the seams on the fingers were blown out in 2 places.Bad/lightweight stitching.If I'd worn them for a week they'd been a safety hazard with shredds hanging.And I was just handling wood frame stock.Not tuff enough for everyday use.I returned mine.
3,Not a long lasting glove for shingleing,"Great glove , warm ,good dexterity as far as gloves go but they do not hold up to roof shingle work. I wore them for about twenty square and have wore through 1 thumb and two fingers. Roofing is probably the worst torture test for any glove made, I my opinion a great glove for cold weather work but if you are a roofer ???"
5,True Grip gloves,"Just buy them...Don't even think about any other glove. For the price, they are the best! I liked the lined ones the best, even during the summer. The extra padding makes them very comfortable, and they aren't any hotter than any other glove. During the cold months though you really can tell.Enjoy!"
5,Good value for light use,"This is a very good spreader for light, residential use. I have about 5,000 sq ft of lawn, and use a spreader about 3 times a year. For that type of use, this is a perfect match -- it is small, easy to store, and spreads very well. If you have more a more demanding application, you'll want to get something that is more beefier in construction.I had a low-end Scotts spreader that lasted about 17 years. It died on me, and I wanted to replace it with something similar. This cost $15, which was $10 less than the best price I could find for a Scotts Basic model. Excellent value for the price, and it works well. The gearing is all plastic and is designed for light use. But, if light use is what you're looking for, this model will be a good choice."
1,Junk,I've had it for less than a year and i just took it to the curb for gatbage pickup. the wheels fall of... bottom line dont buy this piece of crap... spend 20 more dollars and get something that lasts longer.
2,light weight garden spreader,"This spreader is very light weight and may not last long with hard or frequent use. I have had several different brands of spreaders over the years and they all corrode and degrade in critical operating areas even when kept clean and oiled. This spreader is no exception, and now it is corroded around the axel/spreader head and doesn't operate as it should. It never had the structural rigidity to hold heavy loads of fertilizer and has proved to be fragile and no better or worse than many other competing brands. I got what I paid for but don't recommend it."
1,"Very Cheap, Flimsy Spreader","Well, one of the wheels would not stay on the spreader which is, sort of, um, necessary in order to spread grass seed. I realize that this is a low priced piece of equipment but is it too much to ask even a low-priced spreader to be able to roll on two wheels for more than 20 yards?"
2,Clumsy Connections,"The connectors to the distributor cap did not have a solid locked in feel to them as my old set did. The rubber seals the wire went into had a right angle connector, and the wires were straight wires that went through so you had to force through the right angle boot. It was tough to get the feeling that the connector was locked in tight. My old set was much nicer- the snap on part had a right angle built into the connector, so the connector was locked into the rubber boot already and snapped into the distributor nicely. These cables had a ""junky"" feel to them when installing. They did work when I finished the job, but I felt the design was poor."
1,The product never made it to me!!!,Billy Sheehan-Advanced bass was to reach me at the latest by 10/24/12. I think it was 10/31/12 that the product was returned to PBSHOPUS and I never saw the DVD. Just hoping my credit card isn't screwed up. Wasted 31 days for nothing! How hard is it to put down the right address and the right amount of Postage on a light small package? Wish I would have got the Product!!!!
5,The support you need.,"As a server, I carry heavy trays around for 8 hours a day. I also have to bus tables that come in all heights. Bending over and standing back up with heavy trays and maneuvering around the dining room with them really used to put a strain on my back, so I bought one of these.I haven't had a problem since and know that when I get older, I will thank myself for taking care of my back now."
4,Comfortable,"My back gets thrown out every now and again. I do some heavy lifting in my job and hadn't been using any support. Now I strap on the Proflex everytime I anticipate I might be lifting or moving anything with some weight on it. In others words I wear it everyday before I go to work. It is very comfortable and there are triple velco fastners to hold the support in place. It can be adjusted with straps to fit firmly. In the back, there are reinforcements that don't pinch or bind. For the price, it can't be beat. Very economical. I will probably be buying another one for back up."
5,Easy on the budget,"This back support vest works very well and costs a lot less than some I've looked at. The straps are removable, too, which I like."
4,back support,"this is about 2 inches too large for a 55"" waist but it seems to be a decent back supporter. for the price, it's a very good product. it seems well made and should last a while."
4,Good support,I'm a nurse and constantly on my feet. I've had chronic back pain for almost a year. This really helps!
5,Very Good!,"This back support is a very good prouduct, and I highly recommend it, as it was well worth the low price!"
4,Works as advertised,No problems with unit. Quality is not the best but the price made up for it. Recommended. Wife is using it because of back issues due to lifting in her job.
4,Bought for an Aunt,"She seems to like it. The straps are nice, it keeps it from riding down. Price was very reasonable compared to others."
5,wonderful!,"Bought this for my 91 year old Dad... he loved it! This is his 3rd ""Eastman"" book and he would like to read more of them."
2,Don't Underestimate the Importance of Good Subtitles,"One episode was included as a Special Feature on another box set I had ordered, so I felt certain I would like the story; however, in an attempt to economize, I inadvertantly ordered the Taiwan Version which had very poor subtitles. There were so many grammatical errors, as well as spaces in inappropriate spots within a word, that I couldn't follow the story line because my brain was trying to decipher the ""word puzzle."" I scrapped that set and re-ordered a better version, which was quite satisfactory.The actors are all familiar and favorites of mine, developing interesting characters for a plot that had some twists. As usual, there are love triangles and the shedding of tears. I recommend it as another K-drama that pulls at your heartstrings."
2,Misleading Specs,"This scanner is faster & quieter than the similar HP product I tried. HOWEVER, it does NOT scan at 42 bit color or 600 x 1200 dpi using the Paperport software provided. Visioneer tech support said I needed to use Adobe Photoshop (not included, of course) to scan. I tried that and it still scanned at 24 bits and 600 x 600 dpi. After 3 calls & 1 email, Visioneer finally told me that it won't scan at the advertised levels with the Paperport software and that I needed to buy new software and/or consult another vender's tech support if I wanted to scan at 42 bit/600 x 1200!! It doesn't measure up with their provided software or even the gold-standard Photoshop 7. UNBELIEVABLE!!"
1,Broke down after 3 months,"The ADF motor burned up and melted the plastic after 3 months. After numerous aggravated phone calls to visioneer tech support, they sent a replacement that is a refurbished one. The light on the refurbished model now takes a whole 1 minute to warm up. So I'm sick of calling into visioneer tech, went out and bought a fujitsu scanner, more expensive but much better quality."
1,Be very careful,"Be very very careful when purchasing anything from Visioneer. I have owned a One Touch 9220 scanner for about 4 years, and just learned they will not support it, and there will be no drivers for Vista. Not only that, but because the scanner is out of production, I had to call a #@%^%& 900 number and PAY to find out I had been ripped off. Visioneer's level of corporate greed exceeds belief. If you ever think you might have to upgrade your computer, I would advise finding a company which supports its products."
4,Utada's frist single and one of the best,"Automatic/time will tell was the single that made Utada the most popular singer in Japan. Automatic is a heavy R&B influenced track and it's one of her most catchiest. But the song is a bit to long for my tastes. It sounds like Utada is bored singing after about 4 minutes. time will tell is the Piano R&B song. It's a great song and I can't say anything else really. This is the 12cm single and it comes with time will tell -Dub Mix-. It is the English Version of time will tell. The song starts off with a 2 minute piano interlude, then Utada sings the song beautifully but then we have another piano postlude. Wish the song had more singing rather then piano playing. It's a great single overall."
4,Well aged and good condition,"I have been looking for this book for several months, the only one I had seen was in very bad condition. I was surprised to find this prize."
3,unhappy,I've had the garmin 660 for about 6yrs I changed the battery in it last night and now it no longer works very unhappy with it I really need this for work and now I am out I need to buy a new one but not sure what kind to get I need a truck route one and would like on that has everything my 660 had
1,Another Garmin Failure,"If you buy this unit your have not done your homework. Get online and do research concerning problems others are having with the Nuvi 660 and other units. Yes this looks like a great unit for the price. However, it's number one problem Garmin will not admit to is the fact it will give you a pop-up message that it problem acquiring satellites. There are literally thousands of people who have purchased a Nuvi unit, including myself, who are now experiencing this problem. Contacting Garmin is a waste of time. They deny there is any problem and any solution they give you does not solve the problem. In fact, with sufficient research you will discover the problem relates the the folding antenna on the unit that is connected to the power board. Connecting an external antenna won't solve the problem because the signal still has to go through the same connection that the internal antenna uses. Anyway, do your homework before buying this unit and don't waste your money on any Nuvi GPS."
1,horrible,the battery to the navigation is completely dead. The touch screen doesnt even work that well. the price for this is beyond way to much. i should get a refund but i cant because i lost all the information to this product.
4,I don't think you'd regret buying it,"I've owned this device for a couple of years now and although a bit outdated it is an excellent GPS navigator. Directions are accurate and the display is easily readable in all but direct sunlight. Some back roads may ""confuse"" the device at times - one amusing incident was when the ""nuvi"" told me to drive 6 miles and make a u-turn (I was on a jeep trail in the Colorado mountains).I've had to replace the battery once, but that was a simple process. The battery replacement kit (from a non Garmin source) included detailed instructions AND all the tools I needed. I also purchased the lifetime map update from Garmin which I think is a bit pricey but still a good idea. These devices have advanced over the years as most hi-tech items do, but if you see this GPS navigator for sale somewhere at a good price I don't think you'd regret buying it."
1,Do NOT BUY,"I purchased this camera 6 months ago and took less than 200 pictures on it. The shutter broke (of course in the middle of an event that I really wanted pictures). Sent the camera back to Panasonic and it cost over $100 to repair.Customer service said, ""we can't guarantee every product we make is going to work, we'll split the cost of the repair for you.""Ironically, I was going to buy the panasonic rear projection LCD TV, but after this experience reconfirmed that SONY is the only way to go."
4,Second deployment and still ticking.,"I first bought the camera via online. During my first 365 day stretch, I've took many pictures and dropped it about as many times also. But the worst thing thats happened so far was on a trip to Baghdad, i dropped it off the ring mount of my truck. i picked it up and it was half-way open, and i though i surely broke it. But i just snapped it back together and it turned right on, and functioned like it never happened. All i gotta say is US Army approved."
1,Stopped working after four months,"The camera is easy to use and takes beautiful pictures, but after four months it just stopped working. There was power, but the lense would not open. The Panasonic Service Center was anything but helpful and wanted to charge 75% of what I paid for the camera to fix it. I am now shopping for another digital and I shall not be looking at a Panasonic."
1,Nice camera while it worked,I bought this camera about a year ago and was very pleased with it. After six months it totally shut down and would not power up. I sent it in to an authorized service center and $165 later I was back in business. It just recently died again. I'm moving on to another brand. If you own one I wish you the best in having a better experience than I.
2,keep searching,"good thing there are 6 of them in the pack, because the notch on the plastic head is too small, so once you put it in your knife, you'll need another one to get it out."
5,Great costume,This was a present for someone and they loved it.It was shipped promptly and arrived in plenty of time for Halloween.I would buy again from this seller anytime.
5,GREAT DISH!,"I am so glad Kraft makes organic mac & cheese!Tastes just like their regular mac & cheese.A welcoming aspect for those going or gone organic!Especially since most healthy foods are lacking in taste.A delicious side dish or even as the main dish.An excellent source of protein!Being organic it is healthier for you,Without processing & chemicals.Toss in some chicken or tuna for variety.Excellent for kids of all ages!"
5,Delicious!,"I really like Kraft macaroni, it's one of the only premade ones that I like. I decided to try out the organic kind in hopes it would be a little healthier. It's actually really good- tastes a little lighter than the regular kind, but other than that it's really good!"
5,Better than Annie's,We tried this Mac & Cheese because the kids didn't care for the Annie's brand and this was a little cheaper too. It tastes similar to the original Kraft Mac but doesn't use the neon orange cheese mix. This uses actual cheese which is why it's a bit more expensive but it's worth it. We use Greek yogurt as a thickening agent instead of butter too and it tastes great and it's healthier.
5,Our favorite!,"Our house is never without this product. I do not use the regular one anymore. We love it, the kids love it, and the grandkids love it. In fact, I'm going to order some more right now."
5,use less milk!,"My daughter and I LOVE macaroni and cheese. Its been a long time since I've been able to enjoy it from the box. I used to like Annie's but it was never cheesy enough.This is though. :)Mix the cheese and milk together in a bowl first. I use less milk than called for, otherwise its runny.This is animal rennet free, which is why I buy it! I was so happy to find this on Amazon. great price, too."
1,Healthy? Don't kid yourself.,"Sorry, but this product is NOT HEALTHY. The word ""organic"" only means that the ingredients were grown with out certain chemicals, such as pesticides and hormones. So if you must eat Kraft mac-n-cheese, this is a better choice than regular. But, the word ""organic"" does not mean nutritious! Boxed mac-n-cheese isn't a nutritious choice for growing kids and, organic or not, it's a highly processed food (hint: it still has powered cheese). This food is very high in saturated fat and sodium. Plus, it doesn't contain any whole grains. Kids would be much better off getting their protein and calcium, which this product does contain, from foods not so high in saturated fats! Almost all kids really will eat, and even enjoy, whole-grain pasta, lower fat milk, 2% cheese and many other truly nutritious foods when parents make (or buy) easy, yummy and kid-friendly healthy choices!P.Gould, author of Feeding the Kids: The Flexible, No-Battles, Healthy Eating System for the Whole Family"
3,"If you're looking for strong hold, this isn't ...","If you're looking for strong hold, this isn't your product. But what it's really useful for is touchable hold, and for styling. It's great for spraying your hair before putting in rollers...it makes it shiny, touchable, and smell really good. I have curly hair, so it was great for hold without stickiness or dryness. I used it alone for casual looks, and when I had to be somewhere and needed strong hold, I used a different product for finishing. You'll love this for straight styles that need just a little hold, or curly casual looks. I love all the Aussie products for their terrific smell!!"
3,I really didn't care for the Aussie Mega ...,I really didn't care for the Aussie Mega Styling Spray. I hated the smell and it left my hair sticky.
1,Out of date,This book should be updated or taken off the market. All examples are way out of date - from technology to marketing to today's audience. Very little value. Ironically the aurhors encourage you to keep current and they are over a decade behind. A fluff piece that promotes their speaker's bureau.
2,Disappointing.,This book did not live up to its hype. It is very discouraging for the novice speaker. Join the National Speakers Assoc.
4,Valuable and Inspiring,This book reminds me ofThe Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speakingbut up to date and with more relevant practical information on self-marketing and the opportunities there are for generating substantial income.
3,Decent advice,"I was hoping for more, but it does offer some helpful advice. The book's a bit out of date, so I'd suggest finding something published more recently."
3,"Not bad, but...","How can this be ESSENTIAL without the inclusion of ""Showdown"" [one of ELO's biggest and best hits] and fan-fave ""Ma-Ma-Ma Belle""?True, virtually NO single collection is going to please EVERYone, but since this set is likely for the ""casual"" fan (as hardcore fans are already gonna have all these songs!) the omission of one of the band's biggest radio hits is inexcusable. Worth getting if you can get it, uhh, cheap."
5,Great Compilation,"I have most of ELO's albums on vinyl, so it is great to have this CD. When I want an ELO fix, it is quick and easy. It has their greatest hits and the sound quality is excellent."
3,"No ""Fire On High""","Very simple review. I always look for ""Fire On High"" to be in any ""Best Of"" ELO albums and am, of course, always disappointed. ELO's Greatest Hits CD satisfies my thirst otherwise."
1,Why buy the same songs over and over again?,"Good god another E.L.O. greatest hits deal!? Except this time their calling it The Essential E.L.O.!? One greatest hits album is enough. I'm a huge E.L.O. fan and when I heard about this, I thought it would be awesome. Maybe they'd put in the great songs that didn't make it onto the other gazillion greatest hits albums, but I was wrong. Basically the same songs from Strange Magic:The Best of E.L.O., except they've shortened the selection. Don't get me wrong, every song on this CD is great, but it gets annoying when they keep on coming out with greatest hits albums with the same songs on everyone of them."
4,"Wow, every song a winner","I guess I forgot how amazing these guys are. Every song is a must have. I purchased for an adult but the kids (instrumental aficionados) are interested as well, because the depth of music goes well beyond the usual 4 man rock band."
5,"This is only for the music, not the CD","I give the 5 stars to this CD only because of the music, but It is kind of ridiculous to keep releasing the same songs over and over again. It is though a decent starter ELO CD.ELO's Greatest HitsStrange Magic: The Best Of ELOFlashback: The BoxsetAfterglowAnd countless others. Great tunes, but I could've just looked at the track list and ripped them from Strange Magic or from my collection and put them in a different order."
4,Classic ELO... Great Introduction!,"ELO has released many, many, many collections of their stuff in the past (I think as many as 75 different collections). But, if you kind of like ""Mr. Blue Sky"" (you heard it on those VW commercials and the ""Adaptation"" commercial), this is a great place to start.There are a few obvious omissions (for instance ""Showdown"" or even ""Fire on High"" or ""I'm Alive""... yes... I actually liked Xanadu), still this collection is a great introduction!Buy this... and if you like it... pick up ""Out of the Blue,"" ""Eldorado,"" ""New World Record"" and ""Face the Music."" Or get the awesome box set ""Flashback.""If you dig melodic pop/rock ala the Beatles, you will find extreme pleasure in ELO!"
1,Garbage... WARNING!!!!,"If there is less that 1/6 or an 1/8th of a star this compilation would get it. Folks they do an injustice to the Electric Light Orchestra. all the songs have been cut, highlights trimmed, endings and early fades, it just ruins the entire thing. Your best bet, take this same track listing, get some mp3's of it, make a folder, edit the tags, and then you would have the correct and complete essentials of ELO. Plus add from ZOOM Moment in Paradise, Melting in the Sun, and Long Black Road since they includ the ommited songs from ANWR and OOB, this would complete the collection.I bought it for a simple commute listening option, and it didn't make it past Livin Thing.Just a rip, I'm tempted to send it back, but I think I'll make the CD's coasters instead.DON'T BUY THIS, AVOID IT, MAKE YOUR OWN, ETC, ETC, ETC...."
3,"Um, no.","The title says it's the ""essential"" E.L.O., but there really isn't much to distinguish this from the mutitude of other E.L.O. compilations out there. And the version of ""Roll Over Beethoven"" that's on here is the edit (not good). I think we can all agree that Sony needs to stop with the half-witted compilations and finish reissuing E.L.O.'s albums (i.e. _Face the Music_, _A New World Record_, _Out of the Blue_). And if they really wanted to make themselves useful, they could reissue _Ole ELO_ as well, with the full-length versions, and maybe a few more early tunes tacked on."
4,Love 'em or leave 'em,"The songs on this CD are so well-known that I really have very little to add to what has already been written about them. I was a bit disappointed that ""Rockaria"" was not included. Otherwise, for folks not acquainted with ELO, the lyrics on most songs are drivel while the melodies are tough to beat."
4,For new fans only,"If you already have the 2CD set ""Strange Magic"" or the box set ""Flashback"" then you can skip this collection. Otherwise, if you're just discovering them for the first time and/or have wanted just a condensed version of their greatest hits then look no further than here. For anyone who doesn't know yet, the band's trademark sound was an alchemy of rock and classical music. There's one photo of the group on the back and two of frontman Jeff Lynne inside. After all, they were known more for their insignia than for their looks. The tracks themselves are in no particular order,as if they were drawn out of a hat, making it perfect for the new listener. The liner notes give a brief history of the band from their formation up to Jeff Lynne as producer after they initially broke up (they recorded the album ""Zoom"" in 2001). At just under 61 minutes in length, this remastered yet recycled retrospective is perfect for anyone who just wants the best of E.L.O.'s 14 year career in a nutshell."
2,Not the best of ELO,"Folks, if you know anything about ELO, you will immediately recognize this as commercial schlock. The greatest album ever released by this band is the rock symphony ""ELDORADO"". If you have never heard it, get it. Listen, and be in awe."
1,don't buy,"I Live in Michigan and it gets pretty cold. I run a rough framing crew, so I put them to the real test. These gloves are a great idea, but take them back to the drawing board. The gloves fell apart after I used them for two weeks. I would not tell anyone who works in real conditions, to get a part."
2,"Good Grip, Poor Performance otherwise","I liked its grip, It did very well when trying to hold things.Fabric workmanship was poor at best. The red puller thingie was not very helpful. Didn't keep my hands as warm as when I used other brand gloves."
2,"True Grip 88439446 Insulated Gloves, Large","Nice gloves, however the sewn on grip began becoming unsown after only a few weeks of daily heavy duty work, light duty would most likely suit them best."
5,Made Me Look Again,"This is an excellent tool for teaching media literacy and critical thinking to school-age children, and even to adults! I appreciate the history, the presentation of multiple perspectives, and the education about consumer advocacy."
4,Wonderful!,"Adam Ant is one of the greatest pop-punk artists of all time. This CD is lacking some of the early greats like Whip in My Valise or Rancheros... I recomend Antics in the Forbidden zone before this album. The only great addition to this album is Wonderful. All of Adam's work is fun, upbeat and fantastic.... think Clash with a horn section and less of a heavy bass line. Good stuff."
5,Great Songs,"Ah, memories. This is a great collection of classic Adam and the Ants songs. Beautiful cover picture, too!!!"
4,Antmusic for ant fans,"Great cd, takes me back to my new wave days back in the early 80's, Bow wow wow rocks as well. G"
3,"Stop the CD after ""Place in the Country""","Adam is the best example of a brilliant early-80s act losing his way. I'm barely a fan of the Dirk album, and Kings doesn't do a lot for me. But WOW, Prince Charming and Friend or Foe are really incredible records. This best-of disc collates a very nice selection from the best of the best, but it totally loses it from the LAME AS CAN BE Strip album on.Tony Visconti is one of my top 3 favorite producers of all time, but even he succumbed to the junk styles of the late '80s/early '90s fashion. If the disc had just focused on Friend or Foe and everything else before, it'd be a 5-star effort. But the other songs really ruin it. Someone cut up a gorgeous wedding cake before the ceremony."
5,Every song!,"This has all your favorite songs by Adam Ant!! I'm so glad he came out with this CD, it brings back great memories!!"
5,Eastern European Pop Queen,"I first heard about Sertab when she won the Eurovision Song Contest in 2003, with an English-language version of ""Every Way That I Can."" I was impressed with her voice, and when this CD came out, I bought it, even though I don't understand a word of Turkish. I was absolutely floored at the range and dynamics of this young woman's voice. The songs are varied in style, from dance tunes to ballads, a little bit of jazz, and some awesome coloratura demonstrations.Definitely worth the price of an ""import"" album, buy it if you can find it!"
1,"Disappointed with product, but good experience with customer service","I was very surprised at how awful this product tasted after reading all the high reviews. It has a very strong chemical taste. I like NuStevia the best of the stevia products I have tried. I was hoping this would be even better but was very disappointed. On a positive note, customer service was great to deal with, they are going to refund my money."
2,Tastes like crushed aspirin,"I bought this brand after reading all the positive reviews and thought I would give it a try. Overall, stevia is a great and healthy alternative to sugar and popular supermarket sugar substitutes like Equal or Splenda. I have to say I did NOT like the taste of this particular brand in my tea. I prefer the Wholesome Sweetner (organic stevia) brand to this one. I would also like to mention that this brand contains maltodextrin, a wheat-based ingedient which is also found in Splenda and other popular sweetners."
3,Horror and cheese in spades,"Did you ever stay up late and watch horror movies introduced by Elvira, or on some Monster Theater cheese fest? If so this is a good collection for you. Some of the movies like Gothic are genuinely creepy, and even have actors you might recognize, but the rest are pure and simple cheesy fun. Watch them in a dark room with someone who spooks easily and enjoy!"
3,The Horror!,"I bought this 9 movies collection on 3 DVDs at my local Walmart for only five dollars. None of the movies have been restored, so the picture qualities are average at best.The movies are:Disc 1:GothicThe Devil's NightmareThe House on the Edge of the ParkDisc 2:Bloody Pit of HorrorHorrors of Spider IslandSisters of DeathDisc 3:Terror Creatures From the GraveThe Night She Arose from the TombThe Vampire's NieceGothic starring Gabriel Byrne, Julian Sands and Natasha Richardson, is the best movie from this DVD set. There are several European movies including the sick and twisted The House on the Edge of the Park."
4,Truely Horrorlicious,"This dvd collection is a fantastic grouping of some rarely seen films from the 70's and 80's .There are some slight problems with picture clarity on some of the features, but nothing too terrible.I highly recommend ""Horrorlicius"" for genre fans looking for something different.-Dave Grant"
2,Hmmm,"This was an OK collection. I had mainly purchased it because it was relatively cheap and I love horror flicks. I think Gothic had its creepy moments and David Hess was brutal in House at the Edge of the Park, but not as much so, like he was in Last House on the Left. Most of it was pretty cheesy, like The Horror of Spider Island, but over all I was entertained, and that's really what it is all about, right. I wouldn't pay more than the ten I paid for it though."
4,Kinsbury's novella is the highlight of this episode.,"The Man/Kzin Wars have been full of dering-do but light on character development and cultural insights. Donald Kingsbury remedies this in ""The Heroic Myth of Lt. Nora Argenine"",the novella that comprises most of Man/Kzin VI. My only critique is that some of his intricate creations--Kzin mathematical traditions, for example--sit uneasily against the Kzin we see in most of this series--written as hidebound, unimaginative goons. For a refreshing foray into real characterization, try this story. The book's other story, ""The Trojan Cat"", is a decent effort with an unexpected ending."
4,A great realistic fiction!,"This book entranced me not only with its readable writing style but also with its unusual and enjoyable plot. The book also carries a great message of hope and highlights the lays we can change the world around us. It however is not a corny or ""chick"" book. I feel guys would also enjoy it as the author is an ex-football pro. Enjoy. :)"
3,Adequate for connecting computer graphics card to splitter,"I bought this to connect a four way splitter/amplifier to the computers graphics card output. It is heavy enough and produces a good signal, but the pins in the connector are not real durable. If you plug this in carefully, it will work fine. Considering this cable is providing a signal to a four way splitter, I would probably get a little more expensive one if I bought another one."
1,Life Stories The Creation Of a Good Sleeping Device,"This book is obviously not for the average reader. I read it for a psychological anthropology book review and found myself regretting every moment of it. First of all, Linde tries to give to many examples and restates the same thing over and over. When I finished chapter 8 and read the conclusion which was four pages I was a little upset. The whole book was a waste of time, by just reading the conclusion the few points that were made are clearly stated there without the non-sense and all the repetition. INSOMNIACS this is a must buy for you it put me to sleep about 7-8 times. Besides that avoid this book if at all possible. You can thank me for the sacrafice I made for you."
3,"A star yes, but not the universe","Jake is a very good singer and very talented. However,he is nothing and I do mean nothing compared to Clay Aiken. Anyone that could even begin to say that he could beat Clay shouldn't be giving opinions becuase clearly they don't know the difference betwen good and exceptional. So let me clairfy it for everyone, this is a nice CD and he does a nice job on the songs so it is worth picking up. However, it is not in the same leage at all with Clay Aiken's CD Measure of a Man, or anything Clay has sung on. So if you want good pick this CD up, but if you want the best pick up anything by Clay."
5,music lover,"I can't stop listening to this CD! Jake's renditions of ""Signed, Sealed, Delivered"" & ""Isn't She Lovely"" are just as good as Stevie's! This CD is a must have for every Jake fan. This young man has a brilliant career ahead of him. Thank goodness for ""Star Search"" or the world may have never known of this wonderful new talent."
5,Extraordinary Voice,"Jake Simpson is a phenomenal talent and I truly hope that his success will reach far beyond ""Star Search"". It is refreshing to hear such clear, versatile vocals. I wish there were more songs on this CD and look forward to his next effort."
5,Great CD,I loved Jake Simpson from the 1st appearance on Star Search. His CD didn't disappointment me! My 3 year old son also loves this CD!
5,WOW! This is a great CD!,"Jake's performance on Star Search was electrifying and this CD is no less than AWESOME! You really get to hear a different range of songs from Jake...I especially like track 4 ""Something Better"". It is a beautiful, soulful and lively song. Even my teenage daughters are listening to this CD and my 2 yr old loves to clap his hands to the Steveie Wonder songs! This is definately worth buying. Thank you Jake Simpson!"
2,Not worth the money,You get what you pay for. I bought them because they were less expensive than I have seen them elsewhere. I didn't take them out of the box for a few months and found that there was paint missing and one of the legs to hold it in place was missing. I kept them since they were going in the very back of my yard where hardly anyone would see them
2,could have been better,well i bought the album because i heard Chrystal Rucker sing in Memphis. but the selections she is singing on the album really doesn't do anything for me. and the other selections on the album wasn't that great. the only song i thought was nice was the remake of Dr Mattie Moss Clark song Hallelujah Ruby Terry did a real good job on the song
2,Expected something better,"I was rather disappointed in this album. I speak French as a second language, but the music would be very difficult to follow for a novice, and the lyrics are not included so good luck. The overall music is okay. There are some suprises like the song Estelle. It is not a bad CD, but I would not recommend this album, especially to non-french-speaking listeners."
1,What a disappointment!,"I bought the CD cause I really loved Bone Palace Ballet and All's well that ends well, but compared to these two CDs, this one sounds like...The sound quality is really poor, it sounds like recorded in some amateur studio, the mix is really bad. Sorry to say this...but all in all, even for hardcore Chiodos fans, the CD is a waste of money."
4,Anatole,"My granddaughter enjoyed the book immensely, and I appreciate the fact that the characters emphasize family values and an excellent work ethic."
4,Great story for children with exposure to french language,"I gave the first book of this series; Anatole, to a family with one French parent and one American parent and it was a big hit with the parents and the three toddlers so the next holiday I gave them Anatole and The Cat which was also very enthusiastically received.Anatole and the Cat reinforces the concept of honor, hard work and problem solving that was introduced in the first book of the series; Anatole. The book about a Parisian mouse has been translated into English but still includes some french words that the children love to hear and repeat. Anatole really is a Mouse Magnifique!"
2,a little empty...,"The book ""Marrying Off Mom"" feels a little bit hollow at times. The material could've been stretched out and not so childish at times. It was a good concept but I tended to get frustrated at Kim and her crazy antics. The story was written out on a fog and I got lost in its empty air."
4,Nice looking & reasonable price,"I ordered these in white. It looks really cute to go along with my new set of Corelle dinnerware. The weight is okay. Not too light. One strange thing is that the smaller spoon and fork are bigger than it should be. Okay for dessert. But a bit too big to be used as coffee spoon. One con is that there are a few minor defects in the product.Overall, I'm satisfied with these flatwares and would definitely buy these again if I need more."
2,disillusioned-1,"disillusioned-1This is why online shopping is not good!This is something that, ""shows"" more than is actually uses full.It has a lot of sharp edges most all over.Why it's not accepting harsh cleaning is just harder to deal with.Not drip dry able ? What!!"
4,Product met my expectations.,I am very happy with the flatware that I ordered. It is exactly what I was looking for. Would order again.
5,Versatile White Stainless,"This remarkably inexpensive flatware is serving us well. Of course, we use it every day, but I have also put it out for company because it matches our nice blue and white china so well. We like the design of the flatware, the shape of the various utensils and find each piece to be well balanced. It has already held up well through numerous trips in and out of the dishwasher. For the price, I'm not sure this flatware can be beat."
4,good set for the price,The set is not the best but its great for the price. It's sturdy and I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. It's a good starter set
1,Pretty but poorly made,I purchased a set of these in the color tangerine. They disintegrated in the dish washer. They are a beautiful set but won't last unless you hand wash.
3,"OK for the price, but not high quality","I currently own a flatware set of the same design, but of much better quality. I had ordered these in hopes of adding to the current set, but these are comparatively flimsy feeling. Further, the black handle design doesn't feel smooth and the individual parts comprising each piece are noticeable. For $20, they're OK, but I'll continue to look for a better quality product. I returned this set to Amazon."
4,Great Quality for the Price,"I bought these for my brother for Christmas so I have not actually used them, but I was impressed with the weight of the box and the way they are made. Nice gift!"
4,they are ok,"they are very confortable, but I tought they were better looking, for the price they are ok."
1,Horrible quality,We bought two sets of these a few months ago. They look great but... They are supposed to be dishwasher safe and yet I am now down to 3 dinner forks and 2 soup spoons. The dishwasher completely destroys them! Do not buy unless you intend to do dishes by hand.
5,Great Snap Ring Pliers,"I tried a generic brand of pliers (OEM) from Auto Zone to pull a snap ring off the lower control arm ball joint, and it wouldn't take it off. I bought this SK set which I should have done in the first place, and wallah. These snap ring pliers are very durable, and should last a life time."
5,Qi Gong (18 style to health and longevity),"This VHS should be a part of everyone's library. It is easy to follow and may be used by anyone from age (2 to 100). I have recommended this VHS to friends who are recoverying from surgery or an injury, training for a sport, or just plain depressed. The exercises are not strenuous and if necessary may be performed from the sitting position. It makes you aware of your breathing, it cleanses the mind, and it calms the body. This is done by moving the energy within you and around you. This is an excellent tape."
1,Very poor quality amateur video,...It is poor quality. I felt like I was watching a mirage instead of a solid world. It is fuzzy. I thought I had lost my vision all of a sudden. The guy in the video may have experience in what he does but he does not know how to explain it so you want to join him in the process. He seems scared of the camera and you can barely hear what he is saying. ...
1,Not Recommended...,This video is of very poor quality and the execution makes you want to Fall asleep. I am not impressed with the teachings of this video.
2,Lackluster Swan Song From A Great Group,"I'm sorry to report that ""Paris Avenue"" is a pale, lackluster anomoly in the dB's catalog. Hard to identify what exactly is wrong, but somehow the whole thing is just lifeless. If you love all the other stuff, including Holsapple's and Stamey's solo albums and side project (such as the always interesting Continental Drifters), and you really want to have EVERYTHING, then go ahead and get Paris Avenue, anyone who's that much a fan is bound to find something worthwhile here. But I like everything else these guys have done better than this. By the way, for the record, Stamey did not participate in this one."
3,demo-lition,"I wonder if the reviewers trashing this understand that it's a collection of demos never meant for release. Agreed, this set doesn't hold up as an ""album"" but it has enough high points that I don't at all regret picking it up. Heck, the Kinks cover alone was worth what I paid."
4,hey people,i totally disagree with the reviews here i mean Bald headed baby might be one of Holsapple's best.. Morning Bugle i think are very db's like.. Hey i know there isn't a she's got soul on here but give Peter a break... this cd is a must have for any db's fan!!
2,The point of taking this was not obvious to me.,"As I recall, it's a caffeine source by its inclusion of gotu cola. I don't need that part. Other than that, it was a bit of a bother to take and offered no discernible health benefits. After working through almost the entire can, I would up throwing out the last couple servings. Wouldn't buy again."
4,R U Formatted?,"This is a tight album. If AZ waited to do A.W.O.L. and had this material, between the two of them there would have been a classic. But that's AZ albums for you, always two great albums that would have made one classic album. I'd say almost every song on this is a banger and of coarse the song laced by Primo is the best. A change of subject matter might help future albums though."
5,Sleeper,"I just discovered this album, didn't hear anything about it. I was downloading track by track, then realized I liked most the album. This sound like I'm back in the 98-01 hip-hop era when I'm hearin this."
4,damn good,"This album is damn good but I think these guys are hyping it a bit. AZ is brilliant on every bar. Its expected. His features are decent, I only point this out because if he spit a verse instead of them it would make the songs even better. I just listened to Jay-Zs album and it is terrible. So dude was right don't buy that, Buy AZ. But buy Nas too because I herd some tracks from that and they are nice. But I digress. This album is not as nice as A.W.O.L. But it comes close. Royal Salute with the shot at 50 is great. I can't believe 50 took a cheap shot at AZ. This album is definatly worth the 12 dollars it costs. AZ is the most slept on rapper in NY and I think he is the best. ""Pac with an East Coast Bop"" and thats why you should go buy all of his cds."
3,It's No A.W.O.L,"I would like to give this cd a 5 star review but this cd just doesn't stack up to his previous release, A.W.O.L. Don't get it twisted their are some good songs on this cd but their are NO classics, some people reviewing this cd are to loose with the term ""classic"". The guest appearances are not that good compared to A.W.O.L., it would have been nice to see some wu on this album because New York on A.W.O.L was straight fire! Overall, i think AZ could have done better on this album, for anyone checking out AZ for the first time, I would purchase Doe or Die or A.W.O.L before buying this cd."
5,Very good kids cartoon..,"My son loves Samurai Jack, he loves this set. I plan on getting seasons 2 and 3 also! delivery was super fast and product was in great (New) condition! I will buy from KGB again, highly recommended!!"
4,Samurai Jack: Season 4 (final season),"The 4th season offers more of the same high quality animations and music the previous seasons had. This seasons 13 episodes contain some very humurous ones, and even one longer story, spread over two episodes, with plenty of screen-time for 'the Scotsman'. The only negative points I could find are the facts that this is the last season of a great series, and that Jack's quest did not end in it's last episode. I certainly hope the full-length movie the series creator, Genndy Tartakovsky, mentions in the extras, will appear soon. Jack's Saga needs an ending, with full honours.A good buy for fans of the series and animation buffs in general."
5,the tip of the iceberg,"I took a chance on Greg Spotts because he's worked with Robert Greenwald. Absolutely outstanding, if you want to know how NAFTA really works. Get Spotts' little CAFTA book too."
5,Folk music meets electronica,"Gaby Kerpel is an Argentinian musician, and a real discovery! Kerpel makes use of folk instruments, and his rather nasal vocal style suggests the singing of folk musicians. But rather than engage in quaint reproductions of native music, Kerpel takes full advantage of what a contemporary studio can offer, and uses loops, samples, changes of speed, etc. to warp these sounds into something rich and strange. Sung entirely in Spanish (with helpful translations provided: thanks, Nonesuch!), these songs evolve into catchy grooves, without ever sounding generic. Consider the weird speed changes at the beginning and end of ""Herias sin Herir"" (which includes some rich string quartet playing as well). Or the way several different rhythms accumulate at the beginning of ""Sintenerte."" It's very inventive stuff, and you can dance to it. I've recently been enjoying some great wines from Argentina: this disk is just as tasty."
3,kerpel,"i wish i could see him live, but really have no way to find out. i live in a small crap town, but man, i got this disc on the recomendation of a coworker at the record store i work at and i can't stop thanking him. it's very laid back, very well done, and very cool. gaby manages to marry electronica and argentinian folk effortlessly. flutes,loops, messy drumbeats and weirded out voices dominate this soundscape of a cd. i hope he catches on."
3,Gaby ..yeah.,"i dig it! i reccomend to all you amazon folks out there. i was skeptical and ready to scoff at it, deeming it a sort of world new age crap thing, but it turned out to be totally different, and while it is worldly and earth based, it's very electronic as well. it's great to have on while cleaning the house or having people over for dinner. it's a very chill, laid back, but demanding disc."
4,Good Sound?,"Ok, I used to have this on tape. The sound quality was lousy. It sounded more like a good bootleg, rather than a high quality live album. I have not heard this version, yet. I will say one thing, this is a classic concert. The original line-up with a good song selection. The musicianship is right on, although Ozzy is quite pitchy. When is Ozzy NOT pitchy. LOL. I would say that it worth a listen, but $23.00 is a bit pricey for a concert from '72."
3,"A good song, but too long","Movin' on Without You was a single during the First Love era. Movin' on Without You is a good song, it's quite catchy. But it's way to long. Utada has a habit for making her songs to long. The single also comes with B&C which I personally think is one of the better songs. It's very R&B influenced and it's a great and catchy song. I bought the 12cm version which came with Movin' on Without You -Tribal Mix- which wasn't really all that but it was a nice listen. I say you get this single if your a collector."
1,Never got rebate,"It has been 5 months since I sent out my completed rebate form for this, still no rebate."
1,Paperweight anyone?,"I run Windows XP and this scanner crashes every time I try to use it. Sometimes it will scan ONE picture and then it just goes crazy, making terrible noises and just staying stuck. So it has pretty much turned into a large paperweight on the desk. I bought it because I really liked my previous Visioneer scanner--so easy to use--but I didn't use Windows XP then."
1,disappointed,"I just bought this scanner the middle of February, 2003. I liked it's resolution and ease of use. It now will not scan. I tried to contact the manufacturer since it is under a 1 year warranty. They do not have a toll free number or email address. Since it is not in production the web site suggests calling their 900 number for $2 per minute. If on hold for 8 minutes I will have spent the same amount that I paid for the scanner. The warranty info on the web site shows their warranty as 3 month initial, then if the item is replaced they will extend it for an additional 9 months making it a 12 month warranty. Although I initally liked it and the ones that my mother-in-law and brother-in-law bought do still work (they rarely use them) I am looking for a new scanner and will not by a Visioneer product."
5,Visioneer One Touch 8700 USB Scanner - Used,The Visioneer 8700 USB Scanner is no longer manufactured. It does everything I want a scanner to do. I wanted a back-up to my present scanner without having to go to the trouble of having to reconfigure another model scanner. I previously ran into problems in trying to set up different Visioneer model scanners.
2,Poor Windows XP support,"Don't buy this scanner if you are using Windows XP or if you want to do custom scans. The OneTouch feature works well, but I've had bad luck with the TWAIN driver locking up software. It also doesn't work with the Windows XP ""switch user"" feature because it will crash the scanner driver and the scanner itself goes crazy. Visioneer tech support confirmed that they don't support the ""switch user"" feature."
3,Not what I'd hoped for.,"After 1 week of trying to get it to work correctly with my printers I finally returned it to Best Buy who accepted it with no questions asked. It seemed to work fine with documents but not with photos. Not much HELPFUL documentation, tech support answered my E-mails quickly but kept referring me elsewhere. One-touch buttons are fine for simple documents but if you need to change the printer settings for better quality it takes awhile. This was a replacement for my HP4200 which gave me much nicer photos. The Visioneer OneTouch 8700 would probably be fine for some scans but not photo quality."
4,Gator Replacement,I bought this knife because I couldn't find a replacement for my Gator. It is a bit snug but my other sheath worked for more than seven years and I lost it not because of the workmanship. I don't need my Gator to draw quick just not to be lost and it is a perfect sheath but tight. Everything Gerber makes is great and through Amazon I got this almost as quick as I ordered it.It is unfortunate that Gerber doesn't easily sell replacement sheaths for their entire knife line and this only can be carried up and down which I find kind of bumpy when working but it is tough and guaranteed.-CSL
2,Not very impressed,"I wasn't impressed with this carriar at all. Apparently it was redesigned and done poorly. It was given a small pocket(useless) and rendered it unable to hold the gerber tool. We had to invest in velcro strips, add them to the holder so the top flap could be fastened."
5,relax and let go,"Of all Riley Lee's shakuhachi recordings this is the most traditional. Lee's mastery of the genre is superb and the music provides the perfect accompaniment for meditation or tai chi as well as just sitting back, relaxing and enjoying."
5,music for Zen meditation,This is a great double cd by Riley Lee. I use it during the shavasana stage of my yoga class with great appreciation by my students. Well worth the price for the double cd.
4,The best one we've heard,This CD is very good. The individual pieces of music are very soothing and it is possible to clear away the days events with the light flute.
5,AMAZING !!!,"This cd is AMAZING!!I can go deep into meditation state effortlessly just by listening to this cd. Really, it helps a lot in my meditation.And just like its title, I think this music will be tremendous help in silent sitting (zen) meditation, but not for yoga or tai chi, because the music is too silent.Highly recommended if you're looking for zen meditation music."
4,Relaxing,"This cd is nice to listen to when you need to relax. I've gone to sleep listening to it. I've also done my own meditations, with it in the background. It's really nice."
3,dorm living,I purchased this for my daughters bathroom in her dorm. Colors are girly and easily fits into the decor.
5,Back support belt review,This is a newer model than one I purchased a year ago. The adjustable tension works greeat! And I really like the removeable shoulder straps. I took them off and found that the belt stays in place very nicely without them.I'd recommend this product to anyone with lower back issues. I wear it when on my riding mower doing the 4 1/2 acre lawn. And anytime I'm going to be lifting it is a Godsend.
5,Great Product,Purchased this item for back injury prevention. Provides positive adjustable lower back support. Been very pleased with comfort and support.
5,Comfy and lots of adjustment points.,"My husband loves his belt! He found that working in the stockroom was making his back seriously sore and tired, so I got this belt to try to help. The belt is wide enough to provide great support, but not so wide that he couldn't bend over. It has lots of adjustments, making it easy for him to find a perfect fit - all around, a great support belt!"
1,donot go by positive reviews. Donot buy,I bought this product after looking positive reviews hoping this would help me with my back. But I guess I wasted my money.
5,"A skillful, sensuous blend of styles","Even more stunning than their previous album (""Gypsies Of Rajastan""), this disc delves deeper into more overt ""world fusion"" territory, but not in the icky way usually associated with that phrase. This is a gorgeous, glorious, earthy and expansively rich, Asian-based exploration of culture, sonic texture and musical spirituality. It's really quite lovely, one of the best albums of its kind. Highly recommended."
1,"Good concept, funny shape, hard to read","I usually love anything that the OXO good grips people make. I do not like this measuring cup. It is hard to read when you look down into the cup and try to figure out how much is in it--especially if you are measuring water or clear liquids. I still find myself holding up the cup and reading it from the side the ""old"" way. In fact I'm planning on replacing it with a regular type measure and gettting rid of it. It also does not ""stack"" into my other measuring cups, so it is not a space saver.Also the shape is strange-- it is hard to get all the ingredients out of it, even when you use a small spatula. So what good is the supposed better accuracy if you leave too much in the cup-- then the amount of ingredients is not correct anyway."
1,Does not measure correctly!!,"I measured 1 cup with my pyrex measuring cup, then i poured it into the OXO cup and it measured less than 1 cup. It is very inaccurate and for baking we all know you need precise measurement. Bummed out because I bought 2. OH well."
1,Hate It!!!,"This cup is cheap plastic. I would never pour hot liquid in it for fear of it breaking. The rubbery thing on the handle is just a place for mold/germs to hide and grow. The measuring gimmick is a good one but doesn't overcome the downsides. I expect the red marking to soon disappear making it all but impossible to read too. Stay with the tried and true glass measuring cups. When you wash them, you know they are completely clean."
2,Metric measurements not there,"Although the illustration shows milliliter measurements on the inside of the cup, they are on the outside only, defeating the purpose of the angled measuring cup."
1,"great idea, until it breaks","I loved this cup; so easy to see the measuring from above. But less than one year later, the bottom has cracked around the nubbin in the center. Now it leaks. Now it's garbage. I can't support something like this that won't last."
4,Top of the line measuring cup,"Got a lot of these and am not sorry I bought them. The older we get, the more help we need in the kitchen...these are huge help."
5,I Love this Measuring cup!,How ingenious is this design! It makes measuring so simple. Now I have no doubt about the quantities I am using since I am always in a hurry to get things done. I love it.
2,OXO great shape measuring cup,"I think it is ALMOST a great idea! It would be super if made of glass. I don't want to be concerned with material for which I use it! I would buy a couple if made of glass, otherwise not."
2,Design becomes a distraction.,"The over-designed nature of this book makes it a bit difficult to read. Content is fairly good, which is why this is a bit of a disappointment."
2,bloated!,there is about 10 minutes of real content in this documentary. It is stretched and filled with cut scenes to a point of being pathetic.
3,Not my favorite!,"The documentary The New World: Nightmare in Jamestown is not my favorite. In this 50-minute film, a major section was devoted to an exploration of what had happened at Jamestown from 1606 until 1612. The reporting style was similar to that of the TV series, 48 hours: mystery. You will see some skeletons on which autopsies were performed to figure out causes of the death. The sites were revisited. The Indian actors were dressed in conventional costume. However, the scenes lost the flavor of originality. What I dislike most is that causes of the voyages to Jamestown were only superficially touched, so were lingering impacts of the Jamestown legacy. If you like 48 hours: mystery and seek for only information of what had happened in the Jamestown colony during that brief period, this documentary was probably made for you. If you are interested in historical meanings of the Jamestown colony, probably you should find alternatives of information."
1,Unwatchable,"Scene cuts every three seconds, repetitious horror-movie music, about five minutes of content stretched over an hour. Looks like it was made by a music video producer for 10-year-olds. Judging from the other comments, it is successful as a teaching tool for kids. But if you're an adult looking for a serious documentary, don't waste your time on this."
5,Great Product!,"Up to date Microsoft Office Product with better help options and capability to increase variation in use of tools. Although this product does not come with all of the Microsoft Office products, this is still a great standard product for both students and teachers."
4,Good product,The product; Microsoft Office Student and Teacher Edition 2003 is very good. I had it on my computer before but lost it all when I had it worked on and could not find the disc from the first time. I know I should go to the newer version but I don't mind this one.
4,My Review,"The purchase was nice and easy and the deliverly was timely. I was happy with the product. In fact, this week I am going to use it some more. However the work IT department has already replaced it with an upgrade. I hope to use Amazon for more shopping in the upcomming months.Sincerely Scot"
1,Seller waited a month before shipping it,"After waiting three to four weeks for the expected delivery date window to lapse, I sent an inquiry to the seller. About a week after that, I got an email from him with a tracking number. All the tracking number told me was that it had been received by the post office - didn't tell me when it had been sent or when it was to be delivered. I copied the info from the usps website and sent it to the seller, asking him when he had sent it. Rather than answer my question, he just pasted the same info from the usps website that I had sent to him. I again asked when he had sent it, and he never responded. It took about five weeks to get the product."
1,poor,i never recieved the product i think i was a scram the seller was respond went false information now of today i never got any item
2,Microsoft disappoints - no major changes from Office 2000,"Big disappointment. I bought Office 2003 with the hopes that Microsoft would have made significant improvements to Outlook 2000. Huh! Outlook is almost exactly the same as the previous version, only with a prettier (and busier) interface. One still cannot enter simple reminders w/o keying them in as appointments. At least the LDAP problem appears to have been fixed. Word and Excel don't appear to have any significant changes either but I haven't spent much time using them yet."
5,Office 2003 is great!! (especially Outlook),"Anyone who uses Outlook and/or reads documents on the screen in Word needs this upgrade! Outlook 2003 improvements includes: removal of the 2 GB PST file limit; a much improved user-interface; intelligent and fully customizable junk mail filtering; much better security features (e.g., inline pictures are not automatically downloaded, but you can specify senders and domains to block or accept); automatic caching of Exchange mailboxes; and easier access to other people's shared folders (e.g., calendars). Word 2003 has a new on-screen reading feature that makes it easier to read Word documents like electronic books (e.g., you can change the text size for reading without affecting the font size in the underlying document). All applications are significantly faster (support for Windows 9x/ME/NT4 was dropped), integration with SharePoint Services is wonderful, and new features like Digital Rights Management are interesting."
4,A good deal for people who have Office 2000 or earlier,"If you're looking to upgrade from Office 2000 or earlier and you qualify for this version, it's the best deal you'll find on the Web. You get Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. If you've already got Office XP, it's probably not worth your money. I don't use Outlook, but apparently this version of Outlook has some nice new features. Bottom line: if you're looking to get a copy of Office that doesn't require proof of previous version, and you just need the basic programs, this is for you."
3,microsoft office 2003,"I keep getting messages from Microsoft saying that this particular product is not authorized by Microsoft. However, after clicking on ""remind me later"" instead of ""learn more,"" this product functions okay. I guess what I would like to know: Is my copy a pirated copy? It did come in what appears to be Microsoft packaging. This product was shipped by Amazon from a different company that advertised on Amazon."
3,"What I needed, meets expectations, great price","I really needed the programs, but they have all the standard Microsoft weaknesses. Of particular annoyance is the Office Assistant. I keep getting an error that the programs do not have any assistant and need me to go into Setup to add one, but with no instructions on how to do that.Programs function as I need them too and I was glad to get the student/teacher price as a Homeschooling family."
4,Microsoft Office Student/Teacher 2003,I was very please with the ease of installation and usage of the product. Anytime I can figure out software without my kids help is a plus with me!
1,no review,I returned this item--it was not what was needed! Returned it 2 months ago in fact. Where have you been?
4,good product,Well thanks to Richard Sheng. Fast reliable service. I'll defiantely continue business with him. About Microsoft. well will see.
1,"Documents are supposed to be communicated, right?","Using this product means that it will be very hard, if not impossible, to share your documents, in a satisfactory way, with non-Office users. Think about it. It's bad."
4,Good product,"Office 2003 is a good product, and Amazon has the cheapest price. If you are thinking about upgrading, you should not be afraid of this product."
1,Why the hell would anyone buy this at this price?,"The price ""new"" price for this suite is the exact same as what is being offered on here for MS Office 2010 Home and Student. That's just stupid."
1,A little expensive and not a lot of products in there,"I am a teacher evaluating the software suites offer for my school in Ontario, Canada.- The ministry of education pays for Corel's suite, but my students can not use it at home.- Microsoft Office with ONLY word, excel, ppt = 200$ is too expensive, I cannot ask all my students to get that, therefore I cannot rely on it- OpenOffice.org free for everybody, comes with equivalents to word, excel, ppt, access, frontpage, vector graphics... for free. I can then ask everybody to have it. It reads Microsoft documents. Learning curve is reasonably low.- StarOffice is free for Students and Teachers in school and at home. A good choice as well."
3,Of marginal value,"I write professionally. This package is fine for a Microsoft product, but I have found MS Word to be bloated and slow and not very intuitive. It gets in the way of the work at times. The Help function is not very helpful - unless you know the specific term Word uses for a function or feature, you can search endlessly to correct something. WordPerfect is easier to use and less in the way. Excel is a good spreadsheet and may be the best part of the package. PowerPoint presentations are fast becoming the bane of working in institutions - the actual usefulness of PowerPoint is less than it appears and the tendency is to produce massive numbers of slides. This is more of a critique of users than the tool, of course; as a product, I would rate PowerPoint above Word though not quite as easy to use as Excel. In some environments, Microsoft is mandated. For everyone else, I would recommend seriously considering alternatives."
5,Microsoft Office Student Edition 2003,"As usual, Microsoft has made very easy to use and understand software. I have been pleased with this product. Thanks!"
5,I needed Power Point...,"...so I had to upgrade to get it. I haven't had time to explore all the features yet but so far I'm very satisfied. I am in a Doctoral Program that is very Internet-intensive, and I'm hoping this product will be everything I hope for."
5,Microsoft Office Standard Student & Teacher 2003,Excellent product for my 13 year old daughter. I highly recommend this product.
5,Microsoft Office,"I am pleased with the product. I already had a trial version installed on my computer when I bought it. All I had to do was enter the code on the box and that was all there was to it. Very easy. I bought it for my daughter, who is in college. I also have a son in the fourth grade, and I know that it will be useful for him, too. I am glad that I was able to install it on more than one computer."
5,Awesome product,"Ordered this product, received it in a timely matter, installed on both of my computers and have had no problems at all. Highly recommentd"
1,Overpriced,"I came to this page to reccomend that you save your money and download a copy of OpenOffice.OpenOffice may not look as ""pretty"" as microsoft office, but it offeres FULL microsoft office document compatibility. There is not much else to say, if you are really looking to save money (which I'm guessing because you are looking at the academic version) why not save it all?"
1,Terrible Experience!,There was no product key with the disk so I could not use it. I attempted to reach the seller by email several times but received no response. I tried sending the item back to the seller and requested a refund. I never heard back from him. I'm out $80 and will NOT order from here again.
4,Cheap way to get MS Office,"Decent and cheap way to get the full MS Office suite for a much lower price than standard, especially through Amazon."
3,Not completely backward compatible nor a full product,"The claim is that Microsoft Office Standard Student and Teacher Edition 2003 is compatible with older releases and is a full product. Neither is true.I bought this for homeschooling use. I use Office 2000 Pro at work and thus need to share data, in particular contacts in PST format, among different computers. Outlook 2000 can't read Unicode PST file from Outlook 2003. I downloaded the Office Resourse Kit from Microsoft web site to customize Outlook 2003, forcing it to write PST file in older (ANSI) format. Well, I got an error message that ""this version of Microsoft Office 2003 does not support Office Custom Maintenance Wizard Files.""Tech Support from Microsoft has not said anything yet (nothing new!). I give them a few more days. If they can't resolve this, the software will go back to Amazon."
3,not 75% cotton,"I received 5 pairs of these socks in white from Bealls. They are not 75% cotton. They are 25% cotton plus various combinations of other materials (bamboo, nylon, etc.) I wrote to Bealls one week ago, but they have not responded."
5,Integrate the body's wisdom and the mind's ability to choose,"The CODE Model described in The Alchemy of Energy is such a powerful model for supporting the evolution of each and every individual human, that it is beyond language. When I finally got the courage to use the CODE Model for coaching I was truely humbled by the results my clients achieved. The Alchemy of Energy has provided me the road map for a fascinating and innovative way in which I, as coach, can encourage my clients to integrate their body's wisdom and their mind's ability to choose. What is equally facinating, is that at the same time, (if I allow myself) I acquire astonishing insights into what is going on inside me! Double value for my efforts! Reading The Alchemy of Energy will change your life - should you have the courage to risk stepping into your own evolution!"
4,"Catchy melodies, but perhaps not a ""keeper""","Listening to ""For Beginner Piano"" provides a fine opportunity to play ""spot the influence"". For me, at least, the closest antecedents to this album would be European instrumental music from the late 1960s through the early 1980s. From Kraftwerk-like abstraction, through stirring tunes that sound for all the world like old Ennio Morricone movie soundtracks, this album is a journey in nostalgia.Every track on this album is immediately accessible, but I don't really feel like there's enough depth or variety to keep me coming back to it. Once you've listened to a given tune a few times, you're unlikely to get more out of it. The simplicity of the music is beguiling, but it also leaves ""For Beginner Piano"" bereft of lasting impact."
5,"Spooky, Poppy, Bouncy & Lovely","This is one of the best albums I have bought in a long while. For lovers of Air, Broadcast and Boards of Canada. These ten retro-synth laden tunes demonstrate both child-like simplicity and joy while evoking memories of old suspense/horror movie themes. If you are looking for something new that will rejuvinate your music collection then give this a try. I bought it on a whim and am not the least bit disappointed. Will become a classic."
4,Blip Bloop,"I've been listening to this album for about five years by now and I have yet to get tired of it. It's not for everyone, but for those people who like bloopy electronic childlike melodies, you should listen to this CD. I personally like ""Top and Low Rent"" the most but ""Bibi Plone"" is great too as an insanely happy sounding song that sounds like background music to some brightly colored alien land where all the inhabitants are blobs (okay, that's just my opinion...they might not be blobs). In general I enjoy all the songs, but as much as I love this album I'm giving it four instead of five stars because I think it could've been longer (otherwise, definitely a 5!). Nothing really compares to Plone in my mind but if you like them you may also like E*Vax, B. Fleischmann, Lullatone...and vice versa."
4,A new look at a interesting character...,"The first major biography of Judge Isaac Parker to be written since 1951, 'Let no guilty man escape' provides refreshing insight into the life and career of a man that western novelists and Hollywood have stereotyped as the ""Hanging Judge."" Since most of the standard works on Judge Parker were written a half century ago, the documents and resources used by Tuller help to paint a picture of the complex person that Isaac C. Parker really was. While minor factual errors and inconsistancies occur throughout, this book is a worthy replacement of 'Hanging Judge.'"
2,dry oh so dry,required reading for those heading into Native American vs. US Government studies. Have a can of Red Bull though!
5,The Beginning of States Rights,"I found this book to be excruciatingly detailed about the movement of people to the west in an attempt to escape the overpowering influence of an omnipotent federal government. It's words demonstrated that a people steeped in the idea of freedom can come together to create a government. For those who are interested in the history not found in academic texts, this is real eye opener. Buy it. Read it. Learn from it."
4,What else is out there??,"Believe it or not, there really has not been much scholarship on Franklin since this book was written. Others have of course touched on it but there's no modern monograph or narrative of the ""lost state"" (it never got lost, and never was a state, so the title is clearly misleading!) The writing style is dated and the research while pretty well done is, let us say, incompletely cited. Oh well."
5,An excellent extension of Frank Reno's exploration of Arthur,"""Historic Figures of the Arthurian Era"" is Frank Reno's follow-up to his ""The Historic King Arthur""... The work presented here extends Reno's explorations into the real world of ""King Arthur"" as found in the ancient written texts. It's a detailed, challenging book which should be of great interest to anyone who strongly wishes to better understand what lay behind all those centuries of legend and myth."
1,NOT WHO YOU THINK IT IS,"this is not the blue druids you hoped it would be.althow this band is good in there own right,the blue druids that formed in 1991 is a hard rock band that have been touring and releasingalbums since 1994.you can check them out at bluedruids.com"
5,Very warm and cozy,"This is a very warm fleece top. The material is very soft and thick and stands up to multiple washings nicely. It runs true to size and is very convenient when nursing, but can be worn when you are not nursing. The zippers are hidden well and work great."
5,This classic is on DVD!,"This classic has been released on DVD since 2005. TGG Direct is currently distributing it right here on Amazon. Go to Movies & TV and enter ""Christmas Cartoon Collector's Edition Vol. 2"" and you should find it. Grab it while you can."
5,A Classic from the 70's,"of all the versions of A Christmas Carol that are out there, this one takes the cake on being the best. this one was produced in Australia, and it was shown throughout the 70's. it aired every Christmas on a Sunday on CBS.the one major difference in this version is the look of Jacob Marley's ghost, this was the only one where the ghost resembled a skeleton, with hair that looked like flames, a rather scary looking one which is why its so memorable.if you can get this one, grab it. its well worth it.."
2,Stopped working quickly,"The built-in MP3 recorder is a great idea, but mine broke within the first hour of use. I removed the player to put a battery in, and that was it. The attachment system of the MP3 to the radio is flawed, in my opinion, and the MP3 component feels cheap.The radio itself is not bad, but there are better options by Kaito."
3,Greg K.,"Great sound for a small package but you cannot see what is on the display screen without a magnifying glass. The operation of the unit is a nightmare. Press this button 4 times to do this and this other button 2 times to do that, etc. etc. etc. It takes a month to figure it all out and if you don't use the radio for a month you will have forgotten how to use it. So now you start all over again going through the operation manual which is written up very poorly."
2,Poor owner manual.,This may be a wonderful unit but I will never know since I cannot decipher the user's manual. I have other things to do than racking my brain trying to use the unit.
1,Stay away,"This is quite possibly the worst piece of consumer electronics I have purchased in 30 years. I wish it would stop working so I could return it. It has a confusing user interface. Unintuitive controls. An almost illegible LCD screen. A proprietary battery for the small removable mp3 player. Sensitivity across all bands is poor to barely average. Speaker is tinny. Stay away, you have been warned. Buy Grundig or Sangean in this category"
2,Ho-hum,"Like its companion, Volume 2, a servicable if by no means stellar look back. Marred especially by almost total absence of liner notes. May be budget-priced, but all except the most idly curious would be better off with a box set."
2,Mess Up,"The shipping took longer than expected, and in the end, I ended up getting a straight chord vs the shown coiled chord. It works, but not what was advertised and certainly not what I ordered."
2,Not what you see,"While the charger I received serves its purpose, recharge my razor, it's not the item pictured. I thought I was buying the original charger.Could have bought the same generic charger for half the price."
2,Shipped the wrong item,"I ordered this item from the Buy-It-Now store, expecting a coiled shaver cord for my electric razor, so I could easily pocket it in my travel supplies.What I received instead was a long, flat cord, which is great for the charging stand included with the razor, but terrible for travel purposes.I wrote the seller requesting a seven-dollar refund for this inconvenience (the cord works, but it is not the product advertised in the description or the photo), but the seller was adamant that I must return the product (shipping on MY dime) for any refunds to be given. Very poor customer service experience."
3,Offspring of Lovecraft and Edgar Rice Burroughs,"If you were to cross H.P. Lovecraft' with Edgar Rice Burroughs the end result would probably be Brian Lumley's HERO OF DREAMS. Add a dash of Conan the Barbarian and you get the picture. The story takes place in the Dreams of the two main characters, David Hero and Professor Dingle, known as Hero and Eldin in the Dreamlands. The dreamlands are the same ones described and created by H.P. Lovecraft in his novel The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath and the monsters encountered by Hero and Eldin are from the same cloth. This is where the resemblence to Lovecraft ends and the pulpish sword & sorcery reminicent of Howard or Burroughs begins. The protagonists of this story are your typical good-hearted rouges who do the right thing in the end although their motives are not always pure.Altogether an enjoyable tale if you are into sword & sorcery and pulp fiction type adventures."
3,Another New Saga By Lumley,"Hero Of Dreams introduces David and Eldin. Two guys from Earth who'd prefer to stay asleep and dream. Eventually they meet in their dreams and join together for many adventures. Using H. P. Lovecraft's Dreamlands world, Lumley takes them through battles with wizards and insect - like men, ancient gods and lots of women and wine. This novel basically is used as the introduction to the characters and Lumley sets them on one adventure together."
4,Book,"Product was in good condtition. I did not read it, it was purchased as a gift for someone else."
5,Beyond the call of duty,"The DW540 1 1/2"" SDS Max Rotary Hammer did everything that we needed it to do and very well at that. Using the 1/2"" bit, we drilled holes into shelf rock all day long with ease. And when it came to hammering out some rock to get our forms in, it did that very well also and with power to spare. It doesn't replace an 80 pound jack hammer but for the smaller jobs, I don't think you could ask for a better tool. My only regret is that I didn't buy this tool sooner! David Turner of Builders Construction."
1,Only sligtly better than the paint utility in Windows,"Without any 3D capabilities, this software is equivalent to taking a .bmp of your house and pasting clip art of trees onto it - remarkably unsophisticated. I only used the landscape designing software and didn't look at the other 3 CD's (I am trying to put everything back in the box to make it look like it hasn't been opened so I can return it). Reviews for other landscaping programs seem far from impressive either...maybe there are just no viable options in the low-end landscaping software category."
4,Marcus,"I found only the Gardener's Journal worth anything in this package.I went Marco Software's website and found that the instant landscaping version is really old, so I upgraded there and the new professional edition is just want I need to maintain notes on the several gardens I maintain."
3,Worked for me....,"There are so many negative reviews. But I have a differentexperience.Software worked the first time I installed. (Yes, the instant landscaping).It seems to be a good software for someone who has gardening as a hobby.I could take digital pictures of my backyard, import it into the application and see how it looks with different plants.I could also get the details of the plants so that I could shop for the plants.Overall, felt good about the software - for a beginner who wants to take gardening as a hobby. I am still to use all the features."
5,If u ain't heard this.. U ain't heard AHC!!,"American Head Charge are the ultimate heavy metal band of our time. It may have been a while since they're debut.. But i've heard ""The Feeding"" and it Kicks the Proverbial behind. Any head charge fan worth his salt would and should have heard this, but for those who haven't .. firstly.. shame on you.. Secondly.. Do it now. I know that you may have heard half the songs on it.. But the ones you haven't are up there with the best. ""To Taste Acid"" and ""Pretty Face are my 2 favorite AHC songs.. Period. Do yourself the worlds Biggest favor and get this cd.. It is the beginning of the AHC revolution."
5,The Begining,"This cd is straight up a masterpiece among the genre. The album features original versions of Reach & Touch, Seamless, Never Get Caught, and Pushing the Envelope. If you've listened to The War of Art your going to be highly impressed with the early cuts of these songs. Among the original audio terrorism within the songs different from those on War of Art the drums on this album are a force to be reckoned with and sound how they should have stayed. Beware this is not a high end studio album but thats what makes it sound so insanely good. I don't understand why more bands don't try to strive for this sound instead of a over-produced album. Pick this up it's highly infectous...."
2,Very Poor Quality..all hacked up,I love Hoppity Hooper. The show deserves a 5 star rating. But the picture and sound quality is very poor. Plus they hacked it to peices! Most adventures do not even show the beginning or end episodes. It is the same on the vol.2 edition....They have taken one of my favorite cartoon characters and reduced him to a chopped up mass of quivering jelly.....it really is hard to even sit through. I don't know what else there is to say. They really messed this one up. Sorry about the bad news. Hope I was helpful anyway.Tom
5,Whoopi: Back to Broadway - The 20th Anniversary,This is my most favorite album of Whoopies!! GREAT value... Was just as good I remember it!!Not a pirated copy THANKS!! Kerry
4,LOVED IT!,"I am a huge fan of Whoopi Goldberg and it brought back memories to watch her original standup comedy act. I was very pleased to see that a ""re-mix"" DVD was done so included in the package is the DVD from the original show and a more current one with the same characters. Excellent. I enjoyed it thoroughly and I'm glad to have it to watch whenever and whereever I want to."
4,LMAO,"If you liike Whhopi and her brand of humor you will love this. My mother is a big fan so I saw the original when I was still small and didn't really understand the jokes. When the anniversary show came on cable of course I had to watch it. I laughed the whole way through my sides were hurting. When I saw the DVD for sale I got a copy for myself and one for my mother. It includes the original show, which I can appreciate these days."
4,more than 20 yrs ago,I bought this specifically to get the DVD of the original one woman show which is incredible and worth the whole price.The newer performance is OK but is more like a regular stand up routine.
4,These guys sure can write songs,"Not quite the masterpiece as its predecessor ""The Cons And The Pros"" but still superior to most 'product' being issued these days, ""The Bright Side"" polishes up the sound a bit with some horn arrangements on a few titles. Duotang is at its minimal best when Rod and Sean do their thing themselves, though. This is a really good record, with some well-crafted songs, excellent vocals, and a very full sound for only 2 guys from the Northern hinterlands. If you like The Kinks and The Jam, you'll love this band."
5,Great Shanks for cooking,"The 8 Country Ham Shanks arrived at my door 36 hours after I ordered. I live 100 miles from California, Missouri so that might have helped in the expeditious delivery. The Shanks are much larger than I expected, about the size of a football (American) cut in half.They were not frozen on delivery. They come in a durable plastic as pictured and I guess they weigh about 2 pounds. The Ham Shank is cut in the middle, but not all the way through. I made navy bean soup with it and it was great. Meatier than usual.If I could get good shanks locally, I would not have tried Burger brand. But the butcher I frequent does not sell ham hocks. I'm hooked and will order again before winter is over. In summer I will make a trip to Missouri and visit the smoke house."
4,Great,"If you like your knives, use it. It is great to sharp your knives and has a short and well explained manual.It just should have a support, but, if you want, you can buy sepparetaly."
3,Lansky Deluxe 5-Stone Sharpening Kit.,Price was the best I could find at the time. I can put a sharp edge on any of my knifes with out any problems.
3,Works good if you have a half hour to spend per knife,"I would not recommend this product. It will give a knife a very sharp edge if you have the time and patience to perfectly sharpen your blade. The Clamp provided is difficult to hold and the blade moves if not tightened extremely tight. This leads to uneven and unsmooth sharpening. Even with the coarse blade provided, it takes forever to grind down the blade surface and remove any nicks in the blade. I would recommend using this sharpening kit after running your blades through an electric sharpener or a carbide sharpener. Overall, I am dissatisfied with my purchase. However, my sharpened SOG blades and kitchen knives will shave hair off my arm."
1,Lansky Deluxe 5-Hone Sharpening System,The system is extremely poor quality. The braces are made of soft aluminum and no matter how tight you screw the screws it is impossible to hold the blade of any knife. It is impossible to control sharpening angle for the blade. The whole system just doesn't make sense. I just had to return the item for full refund. Then I went to Lowe's and bought really good sharpening system for half of the price.
4,Good product for good price,"This got the knife it tried it on really sharp. I have used these before and they seem to work pretty good. For the price this is a good system. I just used this on a kitchen knife and had problems with the guide falling off the blade, but the blade was thicker than average and tapered down so that might have caused it. Like I said I was able to get it really sharp still. It does feel a little cheap, but it is cheap so what can you expect.Overall this will get the job done a lot better than a wet stone, so I would defiantly suggest it, just don't expect too much from it."
1,disapointing at best,"I have seen the lanski sharpeners around for years. I have known a few guy's who have had then, they said they where great so I ordered a deluxe set. ""disappointed"" best describes my reviewit is ok for sharpening a pocket knife but anything larger and the system gets a failing grade. the wires that guide the stone angle are thin and will flex with the smallest pressure changing the angle. the clamp does not work well on larger knives (comes off during use)I went back to the friends who told me this was a good system and asked them about the problems and they said this kind of problem was common with lanski.and they didn't have an answer for their recommendation. I guess if it just sits on the shelf and is never used they think it's great.having done knife making for more than a few years I found this system very problematic. it is far easier to learn to hold an angle on an Arkansas stone than to use this system.""be smart! pass on the lanski system"""
5,Razor Sharp,"Before this kit I was never able to put a good edge on a knife. The trick is getting a consistent angle on the blade with the hone and that is very difficult to do free hand.This kit makes the consistent angle the easiest part.The system does take a little to get practice but once you get it down, you can put a razor edge on a knife.I sharpened my EDC, Kershaw Whirlwind, and was able to shave my arm hair with it.The only con that I can see with this system is the clamp. I wish there was a little heavier duty or ""beefier"" clamp that they sold as an accessory. Sometimes the blade moves a little in the clamp if you don't get it in there real good."
5,Great sharpening kit,"The Lansky 5 stone kit is the first sharpening kit I've ever owned and I love it. Very easy to set up, use, break down and clean. I sharpened our set of Henckels kitchen knives and my wife said they're sharper than when they were brand new. Obviously, I've got one more item for my ""Honey Do"" list when they start getting dull. I also used the Lansky sharpening kit on my pocket knives and they are ""crisp""! I sharpened my bigger one to a 25 degree cut and it goes through carboard very nicely. On the other I went with a 20 degree cut (like the kitchen knives) and I could use it for cooking.Overall, I was VERY HAPPY with this purchase (hence the 5 stars) and I highly recommend this. Great purchase."
4,Better products out there,It took me a little bit of practice and patience to be able to get a good edge on my knife. I think the Spyderco Sharpmaker is a better option for all sizes of knife. The lansky is limited to shorter blades. In both cases they require practice and basic understanding of sharpening. Best advice is to practice on those crappy china knifes that we all have before using on a nicer knife.
2,I don't know if I'm dumb or what,"This thing could not sharpen a single knife I owned the way I wanted it to sharpen. The angles it says are correct just didn't do anything. Using the different stones in order and then abandoning all order did not do a thing for my ESEE-5 knife and my nice kitchen knives.It must have been the size (.25 in thick on ESEE-5 and super thin on everything else) of the knives or something, it just never worked. I even purchased the stand and mount to no avail.Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy. I have bought a diamond sharpener for about the same price and it works about 8 million times better. Even my smith's pocket sharpener puts an edge on my knives.I don't understand how I failed to do this correctly, it's supposed to be easy. I can sharpen my knives with water and diamond stones just fine, this is was supposed to be even easier."
2,Could be better,"Although this kit works, I am not pleased by the quality. I believe some of the stones that came in my kit should have been rejected because they are not perfect flat stones. Some are chipped all around the edges and one of them came unglued the first time I used it. Poor quality control at Lansky IMO."
1,Not vey impressed would not recommend to anyone.,"I don't see what all to hype is about for this sharpener. I theory it looks and sound like the perfect knife sharpener. The way Lansky tells it this sharpener can give you the perfect edge on just about any knife. Well let's say that's true if you don't want to sharpen anything larger than a 3 inch pen knife (hunting, fillet and kitchen knifes are out). The clamping system shall we say is FAR from acceptable. There is a surface area approx 1"" wide by 1/8"" deep if that that can't hold anything over a 3"" knife. As soon as you set it up which by the way requires you to have a third hand and make a few passes with the sharpening stone the knife falls out in your lap if you happen to be holding the clamp it in your hand because the stands and vises are too expensive. Bottom line get familiar with a good Arkansas stone and hand sharpen your knives you'll be much happier and it costs a whole lot less."
1,Low quality control!,"stones seem to be fine but 600 grit stone is not straight, it has concavity! that's why, I can not finish sharpening my knives, if I use defected stone, knife gets another angle and i have to start sharpening from the beginning..Because of 1 stone, the whole system becomes useless.. I'm very upset with this purchase, next time I'll be aware of this brand.P.S I tried to sharpen my Cold Steel SRK but as it appears the red bolt is short to hold such a thick knife parallel.."
4,Pretty good sharpening system,"I got this sharpening system because I was looking for something that would help me keep all my pocket knives sharp. I was able to get my knives decently sharp ( for example the day after I sharpened my crkt ""my tighe"" it deployed in my pocket and when I went to grab my keys it cut my pinky open with minimal force). For the price I believe that it is perfect for those just looking to keep an okay edge on their knives. But, I also want to keep a few of my dedicated tactical folders insanely sharp so in the future I will probably put this inside of a survival kit and then purchase an apex to get a near professional edge."
3,Disappointed,I bought the 5 stone Lansky set as a Christmas present for my son in law. I have a 5 stone set I've used for over a decade and love it. This new set is disappointing. There is virtually no difference between the medium and fine stones. These stones in my old set are much better than the ones in the new set.
4,Not terribly hard to use and good results.,"I've never been very good at sharpening knives and figured I'd give the Lansky system a shot. I've only used it on kitchen knives so far, but it's really not very hard to master (watch one of the youtube videos first and you will pick it up much easier) and the results are pretty good."
3,Lansky Deluxe 5 stone Sharpening system,This sharpening kit is average at best. I saw a lot of high reviews on it so I purchased it. The main problem is the blade comes loose from the holder all the time. It is hard to hold it steady in 1 hand and sharpen with the other. In my opinion this set needs some kind of a stand to be as effective as they claim it is. I can get my knives much sharper with a a bench stone than this set. The main reason is I can use both hands to maintain full control and angle of the blade.
3,"Good product, hard to use","The concept of this product is great, but just not that easy to use. Large knives are hard to maintain in the holder and can easily slip out and hurt you. Takes a while to set up and get working, but does sharpen well. Just watch those large kitchen knives."
5,Buy the five piece over the three,"I bought the 3 piece system, I love it. I bought the ultra fine separately because I found I needed it to get that razor blade edge on my cutlery. Buy the 5 piece and save the hassle."
2,previously opened,"I was very excited to get this item, because I've had a few dull knives that need sharpening. To my dismay upon receiving this package my lensky system had already been opened and taped shut. It was supposed to be new. Also I've followed the instructions to the T and have even watched a couple YouTube videos for pointers, but can't even get my knives to shave . I'm not sure if my set is defective or not, but I feel that I wasted my $30."
2,Good Idea - Cheap Execution,"The Lansky sharpener is a great idea, but execution fails because they use what appear to be the cheapest materials possible. The guide rods arrive bent, and pretty much stay that way. The knife will easily slip out of the jaws - what a joke."
5,great tool,"I love it, I think it is one of the good sharpenning systems that I own.. I reccommend itGuillermo"
4,Works good with practice,"this sharpener works great, but just don't think that you will not have to do any work. This system works but not without training. Within the first day, I was able to get my kitchen knives sharper than they were when I got them."
4,What I needed..,This works great on pocket and smaller knives which is what I wanted it for. I haven't quite got the hang of using it on larger kitchen knives though. Still I'D RECOMMEND THIS TO FRIENDS.
4,Great starter book,"If you have no clue what the LSAT is all about and need an introduction, this is the book for you. It helps to alleviate whatever fear or trepidation one may have of the exam. It makes it so that you know the LSAT is doable.Additionally, the CD that accompanies the book provides additional insights and other information relating to law school application.However, if you have had little practice or at least know what to expect in the exam, then this book is definitely NOT for you. This, because the book teaches at very rudimentary level, employing questions that are simplistic and are therefore not real LSAT questions.If your goal is preparation weeks before the exam, then you are better of studying 'The Official LSAT SuperPrep and practicing on past LSAT exam questions.It is a well thought out and organized book, nonetheless."
3,"Good book, too many errors","I find there are too many typing errors in this book, especially in the last section, the logic game section. There are more than 10 questions in which the answer keys were completely wrong. I believe they need much more careful revision in the next edition."
5,Give your Garden Trains Room to Run,"This track is compatible with all Large Scale trains made to be used in Garden Railroads. It is compatible in appearance and fit to the track that comes with AristoCraft starter sets. The ties are made with UV-resistant plastic for years of use out of doors. The solid brass rails weather to a pleasing, realistic brown in a couple of seasons. I have about 300 feet of AristoCraft track installed right now, some of which has been in continuous use outside since 1998.- Paul Race, editor for Family Garden Trains (tm)"
2,Ehhhhhh,"As a huge fan of Sarah Brightman and Hayley Westenra, I thought I would be equally impressed with Izzy. Instead I found her lacking. Her voice isn't bad, merely mediocre. I lump her with the Charlotte Church variety - pretty, but nothing special. I'll stick with Sarah."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST!!,"The battle in Mistport was a really good story. The next chapter with the toys was basically unreadable I skipped most of it, and when you think something might happen with Julien turning, all it takes is Finley to yell at him and problem solved. Ending was good, but the toys almost blew it for me!"
5,A good conclusion to the war!,This was a better book than the one before it. Mr. Green didn't put a lot of redundency in it for those who have read the series. Very good conclusion to the war. I can't wait for the next book.
4,And it's GOOD,"In this book the writter gives us a satisfactory ending to a good tripplet, but also promises more of the same standard as there are quite a few lose ends to tie up such as the evil AI's of Shub.I personnaly look forward to the next book...Ps: I liked the part on the toy-worldDs:"
