4,Very good cookbook about one of the least-known Med cuisines,"A thoroughly authentic book on Catalan cookery, one of the most refined cuisines of the Mediterranean which evolved in its own original way condensing millenia of history. I can only find fault with the lack of pictures of finished dishes, but otherwise it's a wonderful book."
3,Not nearly as good as Kansas.,"Disappointing, which is a real bummer, since I loved Kansas (if cd's could wear out, mine would have holes). Lay It Down was not as good as Kansas, either, but better than The Way I Am. The melodies aren't nearly as hum-able, and the lyrics try too hard. I'm also not wild about this title. Sounds like it could be the title of a Michael Bolton cd (no offense to Bolton fans). Don't tell me about ""the way you are"", SHOW ME, live it! Is your life about following Christ? Then let's hear about that.Check out Jill Phillips and Ginny Owens. These three women are my personal favorites, with Ginny leading the pack. Her cd, Without Condition"", is close to perfection."
1,"Michelle Branch, is what Jennifer Knapp used to be.","I have all three of Jennifer CD's, she started out with such promise. Hard driving rhythms, with rock and sometimes soft you delicate beats. However all done with Aggression. Jennifer Knapp from her second CD on, has wussed out. She is no longer the aggressive female she was on her first CD. Songs like 'Undo Me' and 'Hold me Now' are much better than anything she has done. I have all three of her CD's, and she has just lost her spine. Her new CD is much better than her second one, which sounded more like bad country music rather than acoustic rock. Her new CD Techinically is great, but it is still way too soft.She changed her style after the first CD, and ever since then she has [stunk]. I Love Jennifer as a sister in the Lord, but she needs to get with Michelle Branch and find out with a hard driving female can sound like.Aubie"
1,dissappointing,"Another disappointing ""Contemporary Chritian"" CD. Clear lyrics and clear doctrine don't seem to be a priority with most of these people. There are a few exceptions (Sara Groves). My criteria for acceptable contemporary christian music is that it be understandable, with clear lyrics, unaffected vocals, clear statements of faith (not vague), correct biblical doctrine and glorifying to God. Style preference would also be nice but this all seems to be asking too much these days.These folks need to spend less time in the studio and more time in the WORD!!!!This CD has way too much production/instrumentation and way too little of anything edifying. Nice voice but not used naturally and drowned out by instruments. Accoustic background, natural use of the voice and good doctrine would be much better.""Be not conformed to this World!!!"""
3,Musically Strong Lyrically Weak,"""The Way I Am"" is definately the most diverse album musically that Jennifer Knapp has done thus far. She employs the likes of Tony Levin et al and she has come up with a sound that has depth and yet is incredibly pleasing to the ear. But, lyrically the album is more poetic with nuances of the cross, salvation, sin, but no out and out songs that really glorify God or His Son Jesus Christ as on previous recordings. Some will disagree, but from ""Wishing Well"" to ""Lay It Down,"" Jennifer has maintain lyrically integrity with a few exceptions like ""Diamond in the Rough"" which she didn't write. After saying all that, I still dig the songs, especially ""By and By,"" ""Say Won't You Say,"" and even the trippy sounding ""Light of the World,"" the melancholy ""In Two,"" and the anthem s""Breathe On Me"" and ""Fall Down."" Commercially this recording should be a success, but I hope that Jennifer returns to her acoustic roots."
4,Even the jew likes it,"The first time I heard this CD I was absolutely blown away. She has a voice and quality of sound that rivals Sarah McLachlan (and I don't make that comparison often.) Being a Jew, I don't tend to listen to a whole lot of the Christian music, but she's so outstanding that for her I'll make an exception. The act of enjoying such fine music surely makes God happy, no matter what religion. Lay it Down (another CD of hers) is also fantastic."
5,"Better Than Lay It Down, Still not Kansas","OK, this is better than Lay It Down, but still not nearly as good as Kansas. Jennifer's passion appears to be back and this CD, much like Kansas, is filled with the torment of her own sin. This was what I loved about the song writing on Kansas. I was particularly impressed with the powerful ""Breathe on Me.""I originally was going to give this only 4 stars, but decided on 5 because I think I'm letting Kansas influence me too much. Fact is, this is probably a 5 star CD. Kansas was 6 or 7 stars."
3,Not as good as her past albums...,"I thought this would be her best cd to date before i heard it. unfortunately, it isnt. the melodies dont grab me, like her previous cd's did. they dont get me excited. but the production on this one was great and the strings were well used also."
3,Good card depending on your OS,"I have had my card for two years and if you are looking for a decent tv tuner for your computer, I would go w/ the Hauppauge Theatre. But. Yes, there is a but. When I got it, it was still relatively new and it was built for the 98/2000 operating systems. Since upgrading to XP I have had minor problems. First, you will have to download a new set of drivers from the website. That isn't an option as there are no xp drivers on the cd (maybe they updated the cd...dunno). Second, I don't know whats up w/ the audio. On 2000, its great, but on XP there are occasional problems like random muting (not too often), and the piercing noise after you close the application. That latter part is so bad that I don't even run the tv card anymore.Final Assessment: Good card for XP but better for 2000/98 Operating Systems. If the price is still 130.00 - I wouldn't get it. This is an $60-80 at best at this moment."
5,Fantastic!,"Never heard of Christine W. but bought it without listening to it. Put it on my mp3 player for the gym and SHE IS AWESOME! What a great voice, fantastic pulsing beat and all the remix versions are great. Don't pass this one up!"
5,An excellent resource!,"This book really summarizes and clarifies the process of undergoing facial plastic surgery in very plain terms. It is an excellent resource for my patients who are looking into facial cosmetic procedures. It not only describes what the procedures are, but explains why certian patients are better canidates for particular procedures, as well as what types of physicians should be doing them. I have purchased numerous copies of this book for my office, and reccommend it on a daily basis.Andrew J. Parker, M.D."
1,Just ok book,"If I hadn't already read many books before this one about plastic surgery I might have thought this was a good book and very informative, however for me this book has basic information. I wish I had not purchased this book."
1,no,"Hello, my name is Alexandra Marie Anne Bunitorisua and i am reviewing Trollz. I think that this doll is very ugly and wrong. What are toys trying to teach children these days?!? That it is fine to graduate schools? Girls should stay home and help their mothers until they are four teen, and then they get married and have children at fifteen. These dolls are very bad for young girls because they make it seem like girls can particapate in sports, which they cannot. That is my opinion and i hope you follow by it. its true."
1,translation please,these dols are awsome and a dor a ble!! I hav Onyx and Topaz and thei rok. im the one who rote the copy reveiw and i toattaly changed my mind these dolls are soooo cute!!!!!! you hav 2 get one!!!!! U shoud make more like Emerald and Diamond!!!!!!!!!============THIS IS NOT ENGLISH!!!
1,HOW DARE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"for your information sapphire is not an insult to people born in september =, but bratz are an insult to girls because they make it seem that every girl is a BIG FAT SLUT."
1,ugly and disapointing,"I think these dolls oh i mean ""trollz"" are in my oppinion not that flattering. When i was younger (im 13 now) i liked to play with the original barbie dolls that come with pleasant houses and cute little familys. These dolls are very ugly and i have heard their durability is really bad (hair falls out,head falls off alot) i just dont think it is that good of a toy. It also influences young girls to wear inappropriate clothing like belly shirts and short skirts and things like that. But this is all just my opinion and they arent very good ones.."
3,DVD issue?,"This movie was as previously reviewed, and lived up to its billing as a throwback to 80's-style action movies.It's also one of the best acting jobs I've seen from Dolph Lundgren. He was actually allowed to be a human being with a full range of emotions in this film. Nice to see him in a role that permitted more than monosyllabic grunts. He also still looks awesome for his age.The plot was developed enough to inspire empathy but not so heavy as to take away from the action genre.My major issue was with the sound quality. I'm not sure if I got a bad DVD or whether it was a production issue, but the soundtrack and all sound effects play OVER the dialogue. The actors were nearly impossible to hear, the sound effects generally sounded like they were coming from a tin can, and it was rather like trying to hear someone talking in a crowded bar. Interestingly, the behind-the-scenes footage did not suffer from the same malady."
3,Mindless action movie.,Interesting that Dolph directed it but nothing extra ordinary otherwise. A few decent twist and turns to keep it interesting.
1,i think i fell asleep with my eyes open,"i'm a big fan of dolph but I have to say this was a generic, confusing and completely waste of my time.Maybe guys would like this one, but i didn't like this one one bit.Especially that over dramatic ex- wife.I almost wish he went back with the girlfriend. I liked her much better."
5,Best SFII Game EVER!!,"I love this version of Street Fighter II better than the earlier ones beacuse it's faster and of course, MORE CHARACTERS!!!Cammy- She is the best female in the game (And my fave SF character.). She is very fast and she has very stong punches.Dee Jay- He is my fave male character next to Ken. He's a bit on the slow side, but he's very strong.Fei Long- He's obviously a cheap clone of Bruce Lee that shoots fire from his feet. I don't like him much.T. Hawk- He is VERY HARD to fight and he's lame..."
5,"A Is for Altar, B Is for Bible","This is an excellent book for young children, especially those familiar with the Catechesis of the Good Shepherd program. The soft, luminous pictures illustrating each letter of the alphabet are inspiring and will encourage a prayerful response in young, and even older children who may already know their ABC's. I highly recommend it."
4,Beautiful Book!,"This is a wonderful book filled with beautiful drawings of items found in the atrium. All children would delight in this book, but it is of particular interest for children who attend the Catechesis of the Good Shepherd program. It is also a great Baptism gift for little ones!"
5,Perfect seats for watching the neighbors,"I have a very large family and we enjoy spending our free time sitting in the yard watching the neighbors. Although we had been using simple lawn furniture in the past, what made me turn to this was the quality, all aluminum construction. I was getting sick and tired of replacing cheap folding chairs that just couldn't stand up to the 8 hour a day use. Well, not only are these bleachers sturdy, but they have ample seating. Heck, we could even sit a whole family reunion on these and all of us watch the neighbors together. A huge added bonus was the height you get from sitting on the top row. You can definitely check out the whole street from there and even look into upstairs windows in people's houses.I highly recommend!"
2,"They weren't ""All Aluminum.""","I needed some bleachers for my local dog park so I could hold blood sports there. When I got the bleachers, there was some girl's phone number underneath and half of the fifth bleacher was made of wood. Is this your ""preferred"" bleacher? I thought you said ""all aluminum."" And who the hell is Tiffany?"
1,Failed to deliver,"While having problems with my girlfriend during those 'intimate moments', she suggested that I should do something to increase my self worth and esteem. I remember watching football games and seeing the players get psyched up by the cheering fans, so I knew the route to go. Unfortunately, when the item arrived, I was disappointed to discover that cheering fans were absent. I have sent this item back. Would not buy again."
5,"Solid construction, perfect with my TV","So I bought these bleachers last night. They have arrived today already after I paid 1K for shipping, which is pretty decent when you think about the size. I'm very happy with my purchase. I put it right in front of my TV and it's the perfect piece of furniture to watch sports and sitcoms on. It gets a little uncomfortable at the top row as my head hits the ceiling all the time, but I'd trade this for a good view of my living room!"
4,Perfect for cheering on your local sports team!,"I first saw these at a stunt bike competition I was competing in (and winning, mind you). They are handsome bleachers and the cheering fans seemed to be quite comfortable while cheering for my stunt bike winning."
1,This product ruined my life!,"This product ruined my life.I was very excited when my bleachers arrived. I really like my female next door neighbor so I placed the bleachers in my back yard facing her bedroom. Long story short after several lawsuits and a few restraining orders I am now bankrupt. I'm also divorced, and now have a criminal record. Think carefully about how you will use this product. Will it be for good ....or EVIL!!!!!"
5,Goes great with the Brevita Branded Drive-thru.,"I already discussed in another review how helpful the Brevita Branded Drive-thru was for our local dealers.And I saw this honey and decided......what a great look out for the cops.So whenever a ""transaction"" is taking place at the drive-thru if any of the junkies, sorry...customers spot a patrol car coming by we just slam the window and pretend we're closed.Works like a charm every time.Granted it's a little pricey but comon...How much money can a proper thug make behind bars.It's worth it to help keep up our good image of the neighborhood.The 21' bleachers come...Highly Recommended."
3,Open JL421 Badonkadonk Land Cruiser/Tank Viewing,I figure these will come in handy at my funeral with my open JL421 Badonkadonk Land Cruiser/Tank viewing. In the mean time I may get some use of them renting them out for soccer games at the park next to my house. That is if the townhouse association doesn't consider them an architectural eyesore or the Canadian geese don't cover them in droppings.CA Luster
3,Swedish hill rolling festivals,"I use these out in my backyard to watch the Swedish hill rolling festivals put on by the local Dutch membership society. They are not very strong for Aluminum and I felt that they might collapse at any time if people weighing over 150 lbs were to sit in them. If you live in America, where people are apathetic, comatose, and indolent, then you should use some reinforced cement to bulk up the pylons to avoid any tragedy. I am saving up to buy somemore since I am holding an annual pack rat wrestling festival, which seems to be a big draw in the Midwest."
1,No Speaka Middle English,These bleachers were unable to meet my needs. I will be seeking a newer model that can at least come CLOSE to reciting the Canterbury Tales in their original Middle English.
2,Not worth it!!!,"Very dissatisfied with this product. I ordered the ""fat-people's escalator"" because, well, let's face it, a lot of fat people can't fit on a normal escalator. The type we non-fat people can fit on all day just doesn't work for them. Regardless, this escalator did not include a motor at all and once assembled, with the various screws and bolts installed I fail to see how this thing could move up or down at all.""Preferred?"" Sure, maybe if these were just for sitting on.Two stars, the aluminum is very nice."
1,Fish need room to swim,"This planter is totally unsuitable for a betta.The temperature will fluctuate rapidly--bettas are tropical fish that prefer a steady warm temperature.The water will need to be changed frequently, which is stressful for the fish (and perhaps annoying to the owner). If the water is not changed often enough, the fish's wastes will build up and make him sick.Please research the needs of bettas before bringing one into your home, and get a proper tank."
5,awesome,This is such a good cd. I wish they had more music available. They remind me of bands like dilute and joan of arc. Seeing them live has convinced me that they are on top of the seattle music scene.
4,A DECENT COLLECTION,"This appears to be mostly a collection of Pau's early stuff from the late 80's through the 90's. It is a great chance to hear how she has matured and perfected her art over the last decade. Especially if new listeners combine this CD with her 2000 release ""Paulina"" (clearly, several reviewers think that ""I'm So In Love"" is all new material since the release date is 2001; only a couple songs are ""new""). Ms. Rubio is without a doubt the hottest thing going in Latin Pop but this CD does not show Pau at her best. It seems her record label put this collection together with a U.S. audience in mind... too bad they didn't choose to do a re-release of ""Paulina"" with a couple English language versions of its tracks (""Y Yo Sigo Aqui"" and ""Yo No Soy Esa Mujer"" for starters). All the same, hardcore fans of Pau will not be disappointed. Four and a half stars. (As for those who wrote negative reviews: go buy ""Paulina"", if you're still disappointed you may be beyond hope!:)! )"
3,Stick to Spanish?,"Ok, so last night I was channel surfing and saw this spanish talk show thing saying how her new CD was out soon with some new English tracks. I really hope the same thing doesn't happen to her like it did with Shakira, where they sound great in Spanish but in English you might as well skip those altogether.""I'm So In Love"" sounds pretty bad (yes, as in not good), and for those who think it's brand new material it's actually just the translation of the song ""Enamorada"" off her high-energy 1996 release ""Planeta Paulina"".If her next album sounds like that...then it's not going to go too well for her."
1,terrible,"I love latin music, but this girl sounds terrible. I love Shakira and Enrique Iglesias, but this girl sounds so bad. She is pretty, but sounds terrible."
1,no talent,"Is she trying to copy the terrible J Lo? Because if she is, she is copying the wrong person. Paulina Rubio has an awful voice and her songs are simply stupid. Do not waste your money on this CD. The english songs make no sense whatsoever. Now if you want real music, get shakira's Laundry service. That is real talent."
3,Not bad but only for real Civil War buffs.,"The use of actual witness accounts is an interesting technique but it creates a read which is not vey focused. Each witness, telling their own part of the grand story, takes it in their own direction. The result is a lot of tangents that make it difficult to focus on the details of the battle. This should be the fourth or fifth book on Gettysburg you read, not the first."
4,You are there,"Bronchitis stinks, but it's a good way to catch up on reading. Witness to Gettysburg is an interesting product, as it is all first person accounts of the lead up and the battle of Gettysburg. Using various first person accounts, it isn't a steady read, but it is a very gripping read of what it's like in a war. I especially found the civilian statements to be good to read. Definitely recommend to a Civil War buff.3,127 locations long. I picked up the Kindle version while it was free."
1,insanely overpriced,"The RETAIL price for this item, BRAND NEW, is $.50. I just bought some for my dog, two for a dollar. Google ""plush snake party favor"", and you will find this exact item for even LESS than .50. Buyer beware."
5,long live rock n' roll!!!,"I love this cd!!! Songs are great. Production top notch. The music is a modern sound rooted in hard rock meets dance meets punk meets alt rock meets new wave...hooky melodies, great lyrics and harmonies. Such a cool variety of songs. Totally fun rock 'n roll. Wish there were more bands like this-bet they're great live!!"
3,"Shampoo, yes. Therapeutic, not particularly.","Kenic Medi-Tar Therapeutic Shampoo has a nice smell and does a nice job of cleaning a dog. It is quite thick (the shampoo, not the lather), hence the 8:1 dilution recommendation.Unfortunately, Coal Tar Solution-USP, is a 5% solution. When added to a shampoo at a 2% concentration, the resulting crude coal tar equivalent concentration is only 0.1%, which simply isn't effective in any therapeutic sense.If the ""medicated"" aspect of a medicated dog shampoo is of interest to you, you'd have to go with something like Perfect Coat Medicated or NuSal-T. If you simply want a clean dog, Kenic Medi-Tar is just fine."
4,Quality motor oil.,"I looked at many of the grades sold by Valvoline and other manufacturers. I looked at so many that I mistakenly thought I was buying fully synthetic which made this a great buy however, it's actually a synthetic blend not fully synthetic. Still a good oil for a good price."
3,Good only for that transition period in dance music,"This is an early Radikal release, before the radikal techno series came around. This has an oddball mix of stuff that isn't quite yet rave or techno, mostly acid sounding stuff that hints at a techno riff here and there. Some very early 90s dance music sounds (think early C&C or Snap), the crazy eddie song is latin influenced, some slow hip-hoppie jams, including a downtempo recording of the classic Last Night A DJ saved my life. It is worth getting if you're a Claudja Barry fan, who carries the lead vocals on the first track, and it's nice to hear an early track by rave artist Rozalla. All in all, the music is okay, just as long as you realize you're not getting techno. Female vocal and a bit of rap is the extent of it."
4,"Good Disc, Ronnie Earl beginners look elsewhere first","Some interesting reviews below. The Gary Moore fan is probably representative of many people who aren't deeply into blues. I can understand these people coming from rock guitar not being wholly into Mr. Earl at the start. If however you are ready for blues, then this is a good disc. Personally however, I think you would be better served buying ""Deep Blues"", then ""Soul Searching"", then ""Live in Europe"". If you dig these then you will be sold on Mr. Earl. Also check out BlackTop Blues-a-Rama Volume 5 for some great Ronnie Earl."
5,Mary Don't You Weep!,"Wow, this song really got me up and going. An old time favorite spiritual with a hip blues beat. What an awesome arrangement with the Silver Leaf Gospel Singers of Boston, MA"
5,ronnie is back,"One of the greatest shows I ever saw was Ronnie Earl and the Broadcasters in 1995 in Portsmouth, NH-- three hours of blues and deep jazz and gospel grooves. The same holds true for this new album, though it does not feature as much jazz material as the previous albums have. Instead, the emphasis is on intense blues shuffles and ballads, with one vocal (a great gospel collaboration that suggest Ronnie coulld do a full album of ths). As always, Ronnie's tone and attack are breath-taking, esp. in paying tribute to folks like Otis Rush and Howlin' Wolf (and his lead Hubert Sumlin).The liner notes are quite revealing and inspirational, with Ronnie confessing that his love of music makes his recent triumphs over manic-depression that much sweeter. (And props to Ronnie for paying respects to the next generation of guitarists, esp. Sue Foley). For long-time fans, this will be a welcome album. For newcomers, you're in for a real treat--once you've heard Ronnie, you're a fan for life."
1,Rip-Off,I ordered five pack of 2032 batteries. They charged me $5.95 for shipping. The batteries arrived in a plain long envelope with a $0.63 stamp. Stay away from these folks.
2,I love Miso soup. This version is too grainy.,"I have one or two servings of Miso with our without Tofu everyday. If you're a vegetarian, Miso is one way to get some of your B vitamins, as most B vitamins only come from animals. Miso is fermented and the bacteria that thrive in the ferment are full of B vitamins because bacteria are animals. Anyways this version is too grainy, the seaweed is in very small, almost ground up pieces and the flavor is way too salty for my tastes. If you like Miso soup either make your own, or try the Kikkoman products."
3,Okay - not the greatest flavour,"The taste is OK, but not greatest.It's a two serving packet that it 16 ounces for liquid. That means I have to guess how much is half and then roll up the bag to save the remaining portion if you are having a cup at time."
1,I didnt like the flavor,"Sorry guys, I don't know if I wasn't tasting REAL Miso Soup at my local restaurant, but the thing is I didn't like this one bit, and I still have lots of packages left! haha.. I gave it a chance because I love the soup from the Japanese restaurant I visited and I wanted to taste this soup whenever I wanted, at home. But, I didn't like the flavor, don't know if I'm missing something, but better buy one (ONE) a see for yourself."
4,"Pretty good, a few drawbacks.","First of all, the taste is very good. Miso soup is, however, an unusual/acquired taste, but as someone who has been drinking it for years, I find it to be quite yummy. Yes, the sodium content is high, but my diet is pretty low-sodium for the most part, so I am not too concerned. Plus, it only has 30 calories, and is perfect for when you have a craving for something something savory. However, I find the two-serving packets to be rather inconvenient, as it is rather hard to reseal the packets to keep the remaining powder in. Also, I prefer my miso with more seaweed, although that is a personal preference. That is easily remedied by adding some extra dried wakame. Overall, a good quality product."
4,Gettin' Better!!!!,"Better than ever! After waiting for two years, finally Super Ratones' new album is out. If you liked Autopistas Y Tuneles (their previous LP), you ought to have this record. It sounds great and has some really amazing tunes. ""Mas Alla Del Sol"" sounds like Pink Floyd (really trippy) and ""Yo Sigo"" sounds like an hybrid between Queen and The Who, really amazing. A really MUST for every britpop fan."
4,WORTH 4.5,"This is a great cd of old Albert tunes from the early 50s & 60s good quality for the age. If you like Albert, you will like this one, get it why you can. There are over twenty good tunes on this one, this is also an excellent view of Albert's early work."
1,Hole placement is NOT shorter for a child's size hand.,"I bought this for my son. Even though the product description boasts shorter hole placement for smaller hands, it does not. My son struggled and found out that the hole spacing is the same for adults. We had to buy another brand that truly had shorter hole placement. If you need this chanter for a child, DO NOT waste your money."
2,looks better online,"I bought 5 of these for my house. They look nice online, but they are all plastic; not metal like nicer models. One of them is warped and won't hang properly. I'm going to exchange it for another one and install it along with the others. I don't want hassle with taking them all down and packaging them to return them all so i'll just replace them if they quit working. I wouldn't recommend them though."
4,Complementary readings,"There are already several fine reviews, so I will only suggest reading the following works (all of them sound anthropology, good to understand ourselves) in addition to this interesting book: a) ""Vampires, Burial, and Death: Folklore and Reality"" by Paul Barber (persuasive explanation of why people believe in vampires); b) ""Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath"" by Carlo Ginzburg (it delivers more that its title promises); c) ""Religion and the Decline of Magic"" by Keith Thomas (nowadays a classic); d) ""The Bathhouse at Midnight. Magic in Russia"" by W.F. Ryan; and e)""When They Severed Earth from Sky: How the Human Mind Shapes Myth"" by Paul and Elizabeth Barber (myths lest we forget natural disasters)."
5,A Classic Beat-em Up,"If you are a fan of Spider-Man and arcade side scrolling beat-em ups you can't go wrong with this game! I recently bought this game for the nostalgia factor. The game obviously shows its age, but even today it is a great way to kill a few hours button mashing!"
3,Bummed.,"While this is a great game, I was expecting the red cartridge when I ordered. Slightly misleading. Sadly, I was stuck with a gray one. None the less, a pleasing experience."
3,Cool,"The game's cool. I get to play with Venom. It has like an old school street fighter feel to it. If you like Street Fighter, you'll probably like this."
4,"Get this CD if you like dark, but melodically charged metal","This CD deserves all of the praise it can get. It is a great example of doom metal at it's most emotionally charged state. If you are interested in doom metal or melodic death and want to listen to an angst-heavy masterpiece, this is it. I had only heard mention of this band before buying this CD, but i am so glad I did. The only thing wrong with this CD is that it is too short (that's why it got 4 stars).I wish it was a bit longer, but it wasn't very expensive and it's worth every penny anyway. I am definately convinced that these Finns know how to create powerful metal."
4,Depression Metal,"This is a pretty solid album. I was not fond of Rapture's second release, but this album is probably the best Katatonia knock off I have ever heard. The music is melodic, depressing, and actually kind of tuneful. I have had this album for a number of years now and I still find it thoroughly enjoyable. And although this isn't the most original band ever, Rapture had something going for them with this album and it is a pity that they fizzled out afterwards. This is music for bleak, lonely nights."
2,Bland,I don't understand the high ratings for this album. The drumming is bland; alternating the snare and bass drum on the up and down beats with little to no change up. The vocals and lyrics are so-so. Really the only half-way decent thing was the guitars but most of the time they just drone in 4/4.Now I know why it was $1.50 new.
3,somewhat predictable,"Market forces is the fourth novel of Richard Morgan that I have read. It is much less successful than the three other ones constituting the Takeshi Kovacs cycle, telling the story of a corporate Mad Max like universe where road duels are legal and where mercenary companies are controlling wars all over the World. Some psychological aspects of the story are interesting, like the conflict between the main character and his relatives, however the whole universe is not credible and there are too many deus ex machina occurrences. I do not think I would have finished Market forces elsewhere than on a boat!"
2,So very bored,"I loved the Altered Carbon series and was really looking forward to this book. But at half-way through, I've realized I'm just bored and I dont care about any of the characters. The ponderous pacing is painful, the random mixed Povs are weird and dont mesh well.I quit."
3,Brutal vision of the future,"This is the third book by Richard Morgan I have read. As with the others (""Altered Carbon"" and ""Broken Angels"") the future is not a pretty one. A difficult read for me on that level. Society is strictly divided between haves and have nots. Zoned areas are cordoned off to keep the have nots away from the privileged. Physical violence is standard in all sections, even in the corporate world of finance. Promotions are won by challenging the incumbent to a high speed freeway battle that is very ritualized and legal. And of course, the emotional violence that is married to the physical, is also brutal. On a good note, the characters are fully fleshed, capturing the imagination, and the plots are intricate."
5,just loved it,"This novel is a departure from Morgan's Takeshi Kovacs universe that I've so enjoyed in the past, but it was a great read. Took me a bit to 'get into it' as I tried to figure out what this new world's rules are, but once I'd settled in, I found the ride interesting and compelling.Morgan finds a nice balance of trend-extrapolation and mayhem. I found the novel's anti-hero to be complicated and layered. Sometimes I identified with him, sometimes I hated him, most times both simultaneously.The end was a bit ragged - there were some plot lines I would've liked to see resolved, but I accept this novel's faults. Morgan's ideas and vivid prose are great."
1,Every author has an outlier,Preposterous premise: Corporate executives compete against corporate rivals and internal peers by managed road rage challenges. Can't see how that would select for the best upper management. Book jacket notes from the author said this was based on a short story. That's all the treatment the idea deserved. Trying to stretch it into a novel was a complete disaster.
1,Juvenile,"A juvenile, pedantic rant masking as a science fiction novel. Yeah, I understand this is supposed to be satire, but 400 pages - give me a break. Couldn't finish it. Buy Altered Carbon instead."
2,The Road Warrior meets NAFTA,"The dystopian scene is the UK in about the year 2050. The meritocratic world has three classes of people: Zek-Tiv's (executives) who run things and settle scores in blood, Zone-Dwellers who resemble 1984's proles and also settle scores in blood, and the rest of the world, which is basically a huge sharecropper society.The ""hero"" of the story has qualms about his day job, which mostly involves running bloody civil wars for profit, and almost saves his soul by defecting to the UN, but in the end the golden handcuffs work as well as ever. I liked that touch.All this has come about because of globalization which, among other things, was put in place to keep the western world permanently up, and everyone else permanently down.In this book the violence is ultra, the sex is pornographic, the background is an anti-market rant. Oh, and there's a cute reference to his other books.I finished the book, but didn't particularly like it. It's simply too much of a rant."
3,"Enough ideas for a short story, but a novel?","Morgan originally wrote Market Forces as a short story, and it shows. The characters are flat, the conflict is muddy, and the plot is plodding. I wanted so much to like this book--in fact, I bought both it and Broken Angels as soon as I finished Altered Carbon. Broken Angels met my expectations, even though it was very different from Altered Carbon. Sadly, Market Forces did not.If you are looking for a satirical critique of neoliberalism, try Jennifer Government by Max Barry instead."
4,Office Race,"Like most satires, this book is worrying not because the future it presents is so horrifying, but because that future is already here. It's not a perfect book--the first half is overlong and the plot a little formulaic. The climax is pretty slam-bang exciting though. My political beliefs are pretty similar to the authors, and I was happy to drink his anti-corporate Kool-Aid.Richard Morgan's bio talks about how frequently he travels, and I was hoping for more about Cambodia, Central America, and other places in this near-future. Having a POV character who could show the struggle from the ground up, so to speak, would have provided a nice contrast and really enriched the narrative for me. Chris's story is fine, but ultimately it's not that different than American Psycho."
5,"Move over, Mad Max","Morgan's third novel is his best yet. Seldom have I finished reading something and felt so gut-wrenched, not to mention impressed enough to go back and re-read parts immediately thereafter. Here, Morgan steps well back from the Kovacs milieu to a near-future where corporations rule the world and executives settle matters in bloody road-rage duels. The premise owes all to Harlan Ellison's ""Along the Scenic Route,"" but the rest is all Morgan, and it's VERY good stuff. Powerfully drawn characters, uncompromisingly brutal action, solid world-building (overcoming a slightly overstressed base premise), intelligent social commentary and a page-turning pace combine for a truly outstanding read. Oh, and there's even humor, such as a little self-referential jab at the Kovacs novels. Too cool. A new Kovacs is due out this year. Can't wait."
2,"Loved the Kovacs novels, but this one was a miss","I love the philosophical angles of all 4 of Morgan's books that I've read, but I really had trouble believing the world of Market Forces. While the Kovacs novels draw on hard boiled themes and technological horrors, Market Forces seemed to be half Michael Moore, half Fast and the Furious.Love the premise, but the action doesn't grab me. Definitely give it a try if you like his other stuff, but don't let it burn you to the point of missing the Kovacs novels!"
1,So bad it would make a socialist wanna swing side,"Totally un-realistic and unbelievable story, characters lacking any interest, full of clichés, my guess is that most of the good reviews were based on biased opinions made out of this book synopsis, not from actual readers.Alternatively, thriller for politically correct readers having never read a thriller.For all the others, go back to effective and well written social thrillers like those of Raymond Chandler, Jim Thomson, Chester Himes, James Crumley etc."
4,Creeping out,"Morgan's gift for explorations of personality is apparent here. In this book, he tracks the destruction of humane sensibilities in the play of competitive forces. It is well done and good reading."
1,as bad as It could have been written by 14 years old adolescent.,"After reading the back cover critics I bought it expecting some quality.I read it entirely looking for that little sample of quality and i'm still looking after it.really the story is ridiculous. maybe because I'm spanish and I don't get the philosophy behind it, i'm just kidding, this book could have been written by an adolescent (may be richard Morgan wrote it when he was 12)the story is about brokers that kill other executive on the road before they reach their office so they can get their job. can you think about something more stupid."
1,A juvenile mockery of his Takeshi Kovacs novels,"I was very hopeful about Market Forces as I really enjoyed Morgan's Takeshi Kovacs novels. But I was stunned by just how terrible this book was. I literally thought the whole thing was a joke, and read through the first few chapters hoping he would start the ""real"" story. The premise and plot make absolutely no sense. This ""investment"" firm hires stunt drivers who earn their reputation by killing each other in car races. They have no actual investment skills, and how the firm actually makes any money is never explained (at least not before I could no longer stand to read). It almost seemed that the whole book was slapped together by a 12 year-old writing under Morgan's name. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,What a load of crap!,"Considering how much fun his first two books were, this pointless violence, sex, drinking and machismo bored me so much I dropped the book halfway through. What happened to this guy? Did success make him write this in a hurry to please his publisher? Man, this book has no real plot except to drive, drink, f**k and write some of the worst prose in the English language. I hope #4 is better but I'll try a library copy first......"
2,Disappointing and Preposterous,"I enjoyed Morgan's first novels but this one was a real disappointment. Morgan clearly doesn't understand economics and political science. Career advancement depending on wins an armored car duel? Megacorporations making billions legally funding wars? And I was floored by Morgan's recommendations at the end of the novel. The writers he listed are buffoons. I guess Morgan had an off day - or perhaps an off couple of months. Pass on this one. It's really not worth reading, and I'm sorry I bought the book."
2,Poor effort after two winners,"First off - I truly enjoyed Altered Carbon and Broken Angels - superb, dense, pieces of hard sci fi that were hard to put down.I didn't like this book and could barely finish it. The storyline was predictable, the writing was below Morgan's usual standard and the political analysis was simplistic to say the least.This actually is not a sci fi book at all but a polemic. The author should spare us the warmed over Chomsky and stick to the far future. I look forward to a return to form."
2,I hate to say it,"After reading the Takeshi Kovac's series, I was thrilled when I foundMarket Forces. Unfortunately it left me very disappointed. Whereas Morganwas able to create a rich and textured world of the future in the Kovacsseries, this one is barely believable and somewhat 2-dimensional. Theprotagonist is certainly no Kovacs, either, although I suspect that iswhat Morgan wanted. My apologies Morgan fans, I did not want to write thisreview. In my opinion, though, you can miss this one."
2,The least of Morgan's novels to date,"I'll be brief: this is the least of Morgan's books. The writing is almost a parody of his better work. The characters are cut-outs. The premise, while amusing, is poorly thought out and explained. The politics are pushed too nakedly (and I'm a member of the choir Morgan is preaching to.) Do yourself a favor and just re-read Altered Carbon."
1,Nice screenplay for a Keanu Reeves movie!,The car-crash death matches are beyond silly and the novel is hardly speculative. Major corporations already influence conflicts in poorer parts of the world.
3,It hurts,"Ok, this is not the Catch-22 that we all grew up with and love. One has to look at this as an album of the band's progression or degression and how the band has evolved. That being said, and looking at this as some completely different and totally new ska band, the album is nothing special. Someone earlier said Good Charolette with horns and that's a pretty close description. The lyrics aren't smart or intelligent. It's really just kind of blah....except the drinking song. The drinking song is good, but there are other better drinking songs out there. Go listen to Big D, Voodoo, Streetlight, Aquabats for some good ska. If you want mediocre ska, buy this album."
2,wow..... thats all i can say,wow ... this cd is disapointing. If your expecting another keasby nights you will be very surprised. It serriously doesnt even come close to any of their previous recordings. If you want to listen to a more pop/ska type record i guess this would be a good thing to buy. If your just being introduced to catch 22 then i strongly recomend buying keasby nights instead. I gave it 2 stars because catch 22 put out the album and they are an amazing band. I would buy it just to complete your catch 22 colection. I felt the only good song was number 7. If i could say it one more time BUY KEASBy NIGHTS INSTEAD. Oh yea go see them live they are increadible. Buy the cd just to support this insanly good band even if it is as bad as it is. they should be respected for there amazing previous albums. Maybe we will all forget this album was ever created and they will make another keasby nights. that would be the day. i guess try to enjoy this album if you can.
3,Good CD....but nothing like Catch 22,The obvious issue on the album is that it sounds nothing like Catch 22. Some of you Catch 22 fans like me didn't want to believe it. But it's true. The CD has great brass parts and good vocals....but it's just not Catch 22 style...at all.
1,What in the heck?,"Seriously, what in the heck happened to these guys? They used to be so good! This album is terrible. I sold it right away, and that doesn't make up for the five minutes I spent trying to figure out if the CD was a gag gift from my girlfriend. Honestly, I have seldom heard more cheap pop ska punk imitations. Maybe I should go out and buy some MXPX while I am at it. Good lord, don't waste your money on this CD - you'll only encourage them! Let's return to ""alone in a crowd"" and ""keasbey nights,"" huh guys?"
5,"Definetly different, but change is good","I am very suprised by some of the horrible review's im seeing here. As many have said, the departure of tom and round half the rest of the original c22 has made a huge difference in the bands current song writing. This however is not bad. I think whats really goin on is that people just aren't giving it a chance. I will be the first to admit, i took one listen to ""rocky"" and said ""eww...no horns no beat, no nothing."" but if you just manage to get that ""its not catch!"" mentality out of your head, i think you'll find this to be a premium ska album. and for thoes of you who still hate it, you can't say that the breakdown on the hidden track didn't have your head bobbin'."
4,"New direction,same energy","Granted,as many of the reviewers here,it took me less than a minute to buy the cd. I listened to it one time,and put it away for a few months. I picked it back up and popped it in my cd player on a long drive and fell in love with it!The song writing is a little different,and true, Ryan sounds totally different than anyone else (kevin does the lead vocals for most of the older songs). But, Catch 22, and the ska scene itself is never just about the lyrics. The horns are simply amazing on the album. Yes,they are slower than on Alone in the crowd, and keaseby nights, but I'm never let down at the re-invention of the horns by C22.The lyrics are a little more mature,and reflect a lot more what the band, is facing. I mean, come on, would you expect men to write songs like boys? The daily life is different, and thus songs are going to be too. The shows are still as good with dinosaur sounds as they've ever been.Evolution of a band is a must have, and I think this album is too."
2,We Want Keasby,"In the words of Reel Big Fish: ""Everything Sucks.""Well, maybe not everything. The horns are still good. But everything else seems poppy and simplified. I'm still going to see them at the ""Ska is Dead"" show but this new cd is completely dissapointing compared to Keasby Nights, as many fans have pointed out. Those poppy vocals don't cut it and the lyrics don't either. I say go back to the good stuff."
2,i dunno,"i have been a catch 22 for a while now and well i must say it is a sad day when i say that this cd isnt all that great, it is the first cd i have bought by any artist and said wow i wish i haven't, i will give them credit tho there are a few good tracks but if you are a catch fan and want some uplifting check out Streetlight Manifesto, it is like the keasby sound, sorry fellow catch fans i am just not impressed with Dinosaur Sounds."
1,i had to take a shower after listening to this,"i heard 2 of these songs from mp3.com and i have to say if the rest of the albums is like this then if you ever liked catch 22 you should never get this. It would be a good album if it were anyone but catch 22, but with their new new singer, who doesnt have the signiture raspy voice of their past, it just sounds wrong (he sounds like tony from mest kinda). Its a combination of metal and ska and its just not working out.when i heard the songs it made me cringe...if you fell in love with keasby nights and dug alone in a crowd..youll get what im saying"
4,Change is good,"Ok. Many, many people who I have spoken to about this album agree that its definately not the same Catch 22 that they were used to. This album certainly has a different feel than the cheasy ""Keasby Nights"" album or the more serious ska-core like ""Alone in a Crowd"". However, Catch 22 is moving onward without Thomas Kanoly, and they are doing a fine job. Granted, they are more of a ""Rock with horns"" band instead of a ""punk with horns"" band, but I think the change will ultimately be better than what they started with. Any band who loses their main singer/songwriter will go through a tough transitional phase. Lets just be patient and see where they go with their sound in the years to come. Who knows - maybe their next album will be even better."
2,WOW>>..,"All I can say is what a dissappiontment these follow up albums are since Tom Kalnoky and others left the band. Seriously, the band shouldn't be called Catch 22 anymore because they just live off the fame of the original members and Keasbey nights. Its sad to see how people think Catch 22 is the same band as it was. Buy the Streetlight Manifesto album instead."
3,If you forget....,"Take a second and forget about Keasby Nights. Go back and listen to this cd. Its not bad. Kind of GOOD. I wont rate it a 4, its not amazing. But it passes. I just got a chance to see Catch at the Ska is Dead tour. I was pleased. They played On and On and On......really made me think ""wow these guys are getting back"". Or maybe it was because they played AFTER Big D and the Kids Table, who was less then steller that night."
3,not very form fitting,"I purchased this blouse for my daughter in law. When I asked her about the fit and comfort of the blouse she said that it was not really designed for her body. The nurseing openings were more towards her torso than he breast area and that the zippers were very uncomfortable. She also stated, Had I known it was designed in such a way, I would never have put it on my wishlist so you would never have bought it. So I assume that she is not very satisfied with this blouse."
4,Kenwood Deck,"Works well, looks nice. My only issue was having to use the remote to enter the station names."
1,Simply the worst. Be warned.,I got a 10 pack. The best one has the capacity of <600mAh. Five of those charge for <5 min before showing full. The rest four don't charge at all.I've been primarily using rechargeables since early 90s and currently have 80+ AA and AAAs in service. This is the worst bunch.Chargers used: La Crosse BC900 and Vansen BC1HU.
3,"good for new, not so much for used","The book is very focused on the process of buying a new manufactured home through a dealership. Help for those buying used through indiviuals or realtors, particularly what to look for with an older home, isn't in this book. I think it's a good resource for buying new, but I'm not and this book wasn't what I had hoped for."
1,One Man's Experience with Buying a Manufactured Home,"The book documented the pitfalls of the entire process from buying to initially living in a manufactured home. It was written from the prespective of documentating the author's excursion into buying a home and sprinkled with some anecdotes of other buyers experiences. It was strong on counter tactics but I felt weak on prevention. The book was padded with court cases and amortization tables. After I read the book, I concluded the entire process was so full of crooks - why bother. Why bother - obviously you need a cheap house, which as the book illustrates may become, in time, very expensive. The book did not live up to my expectations based on the earlier reviews."
5,Good Job,"Speedy delivery, product as described, and my wife love's the video. I would use this seller again. Thanks."
5,Ellen Barrett does it again!,"Once again I truly benefitted from another Ellen Barrett workout DVD. Her cueing, instruction and professionalism show it. She knows how to turn what some consider a tedious plain exercise into a spot on fun, enjoyable and worth it workout!"
3,Could have worked more areas of the body,"The first 15 minutes of the video are all commercials. So really you are only getting a 30 minute workout. The video is called Bikini ready fast but the area mostly worked was the arms. I was disappointed because I assumed that they would have a variety of exercises working all areas; legs, butt, stomach and arms.I will still use this video in my exercise routine because I do want to get my moneys worth. But if I knew what to expect I probably would not have purchased this video."
4,"Very good, different kind of workout","The instructor was great, perfectly motivating attitude w/ excellent cueing. This DVD uses exercises we are all familiar with (plie squats, traditional squats, lunges, bicep curls, etc.) but puts a different spin on them. I was disappointed when I saw that the DVD was so short when I was putting it into the player; however by the time it was over, I was glad it wasn't any longer! If I could change anything, I would have liked to see more lower body and abs and not so much of a focus on upper body. A good worthwhile workout, and I plan on trying the other SELF DVDs. The upper body sections are relentless so I would caution on using anything higher than 3 lb dumbbells; certainly no more than 5 lb...to help prevent strain on your joints and possible injury."
1,Disapponting!,I have been reading Self magazine for years and have diligently cut out the different exercises that they had published. I thought that the DVD will be as equally challenging but it's a workout for BEGINNERS. It is a short circuit training workout. There are three exercises that work out the upper and the lower body and you do two sets of each. There are better workouts one could get for $20. For a true 30 min circuit challenge try David Kirsch's Boot camp or you a better off buying a proper strength training workout.I was so disappointed with the workout that I am not even going to consider buying any of the other DVD workouts from Self.
4,"Love it Oveall, but...","I'm a beginner with working out again, and for the most part I love this workout. It's fun, it's not quite like anything I've seen before, it keeps my heart rate up, and with 3lb weights (again, I'm just starting to work out again) I feel the burn by the end. The warm up isn't quite long enough for my taste, and neither is the cool down, but they're adequate. The only complaint I have with this workout is that I never feel it in my abs. I had the same problem with Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred, and most workouts besides Pilates and belly dance, so maybe it's just me. The actual time for this workout is about 30-35 minutes, according to my calculations. The end of the DVD has some information about healthy eating and the like.Basically, I think if you're a beginner, this would be great. If you're not, you may like it for days you want a less intense workout, or maybe try heavier weights."
5,Great workout DVD,I love this workout DVD. This is the perfect way to get a workout with weights. I have bought several and this is the ONLY one I still use. Ive used it for 2 years and I am still not bored with it. LOVE LOVE IT!
5,Another great Ellen Barrett DVD,"Ellen Barrett is my favorite fitness instructor. This is one of her older fitness DVDs, but it's still a good one. Your upper body will get a challenging workout with this strength training DVD. There is a bonus 5-minute core training segment at the end. The setting is very calming, set at the beach with waves ebbing in and out, and Ellen's instruction is easy to follow."
5,Excellent Pick,"This was the first DVD of Self's that I have tried, although I've been a magazine subscriber for over five years. This video worked great for my legs/thighs, especially because that is the hardest spot for me to tone or see improvement while working out, and this one actually showed definition only SIX TIMES of doing the workout. Lots of arm movement and leg plies and combinations of upper and lower body. This has proven to be THE most valuable workout DVD of my 30-some exercise video collection! This is definitely one that I do every week to feel energized and refreshed!"
5,Aerobic Instructor,I was very pleased with this exercise DVD. I feel that I get a good workout with it. I am always looking for something different and this definitely fit the bill. Really enjoy Ellen Barrett--great instructor.
3,Fair Workout,"The content is not super challenging, but I use the DVD on days where I need a break from my intense workouts. I enjoy the stretching and pilates elements. It would have been nice to have a longer circut on abs, but core workouts are also covered. I do not believe that this DVD alone can get you bikini ready. I purchased the DVD for an amazing price and thought to try it out."
4,Great workout for my rotation,"This workout fits right into my DVD rotation. Like most working women, my time is short and I don't want to spend it driving to/from the gym. This and the other SELF DVDs let me squeeze in a workout in the morning. It hits every part of my body, especially if you also do the 5 minute bonus 'pilate' workout for Abs. Good workout for beginners and the time-crunched when you want to do something good for your body."
4,"Good alternate for days not ""walking"" with Leslie Sansone","I like this DVD for days when I want something different than my Leslie Sansone walking tapes. The setting is nice (beach) and the workout uses hand weights for that extra toning. The cueing is good also. For me, this is a tape that I dont have to learn. I can just pop it in the player and do the whole thing. BTW, I dont use it to get Bikini ready - I just use it as a workout. I use 2 pound weights. Those who are more advanced can use heavier weights."
4,Great Upper Body Workout,"This is a solid upper body workout, with some (less intense) lower body work, as well (plies, a few squats and some lunges). This is not a difficult workout by any means, but it is simple, graceful, and effective. I love Ellen Barrett's workouts because they always contain moves that feel SO good to do and I feel so good afterward! Even if other workouts might be more effective short-term, I enjoy this and other Ellen dvds so much that I do them over and over again and get more out of them long-term. I'm not really sure why this is billed as a ""bikini-ready"" workout, as when I think of getting bikini-ready my arms are the least of my worries, and the arms/upper body are what gets worked the most in this workout, but it's still a good, effective, enjoyable routine, especially for beginners or less intense days."
5,great workout when time is limited,"this workout is definitely getting to all parts of your body, but as a serious athelete this is more of a warm up or ""qiuckie"" work out if i'm tired and don't have a lot of energy but want to do, something."
3,Ritter tells it like it is...,Ritter knows his subject matter and tells it like it is. The copy is heavy and I found myself trudging through some of the prose.
1,Apology for genocide,"Indeed Scott Ritter has a ""once and for all"" Final Solution to the Iraqi Question: launch a full invasion of Iraq with the aim of occupying Baghdad and trying Saddam Hussein for war crimes.Scott Ritter ingeniously articulates the current mass starvation and disease in Iraq as a form of malignant ""self-consumption"": the Iraqi people have turned inward and are feasting on their own decaying carcass. It is always amazing to watch apologists for state power and murder construct perverse readings of situations of direct oppression.Anyway this book is rife with contradictions. On one page Ritter worries about Iraq's latent military capacity; on another he gloats over the country's utter lack of defense against daily US bombings.As long as the American people remain duped by arguments about the ""national interest"" and the role of violence in maintaining world power then books by Eichmann-types like Ritter will continue to get press and praise."
2,"Should be titled ""A Portion of Brazil""","I've enjoyed the other Frommer's Guides I've used, particularly the one for Costa Rica, so I ordered Frommer's Brazil online. I was quite disappointed to discover the book covers only a small portion of Brazil's geography. Not only is the sparsely inhabited interior not covered, the southern states, home to more than a million people and a vacation destination for hundreds of thousands of Brazilians and Argentines are not so much as mentioned. It's improper to title the book ""Brazil"" when it's really about a dozen or so major destinations."
2,"Data, Voice, and Video Cabling","Very dissappointing. The video cabling section didn't discuss splitters, taps, attenuators, modulators,signal loss and many other areas of video installation. The other sections were somewhat better but also lacking in depth. I've learned more from reading the appendixes in the Leviton Catalog."
1,Wtf..?,"Dont watch this series, It does NOT make sense and does NOT follow the manga. Nothing about this series makes any kind of sense..compared to the original manga, the author of the manga told the creator of this to do his own story, something seperate from the books, and he butchered it. Now when it comes to FMA brotherhood, I have nothing bad to say, Its and excellent anime and probably my favorite anime of all time!"
5,One of the best anime series....,"Fullmetal Alchemist is one of the best anime series ever. Great storyline, great animation, and characters that you feel for after the first episode. The line between Pure Good and Pure Evil is blurred, as the ""Good guys"" and the ""Bad guys"" have both qualities. As one voice actor in the extras state ""even the Good guys are broken"". The second season takes up where the first leaves off, with the brothers trying to find a way to fix their bodies with the help of alchemy's fabled Philosopher's Stone. I'm not going to spoil anything, but it leaves off for so much more to follow, with the movie ""The Conqueror of Shambala"" as the follow-up to the series. A must for every anime fan, newbies and anime veterans alike."
5,If you love the show,If you love the show you will love this box set. It comes with guide books and plenty of extras. My daughter loves the series and has been very pleased with her videos.Now we just need the Brotherhood series to complete our collection.
1,anti-enlightenment,I read 31 pages of ego-maniacal drivel devoid of a single sentence written from true self. This is all mind ramblings of an ego that thinks it has found enlightenment. This was a very negative experience for me especially because I can see people getting taken in by this ego embracing enlightenment course. As for me I'll stick with Adyashanti and Eckhart Tolle.
4,"No hard information, but great stories","Go Girl (by Elaine Lee, Eighth Mountain Press) is a delightful collection of travel stories by and for black American women. An inspiring collection of information and essays by Maya Angelou, Alice Walker, and others, Go Girl is the essential guide for a sojournin' sista. While there's a disappointing lack of hardcore information specifically for the black traveler, the beautiful first-person stories are treasures for any reader."
5,Around the world with a different viewpoint...,"I bought this book before going overseas for the first time and found the stories compelling and informative. Rich with tips and tricks, it is unique in that it is written from the viewpoint of Black female travelers. From China to Yugoslavia, across the African diaspora from Africa to the Caribbean, and other points abroad, these stories of world travel are often funny, sometimes reflective, and always interesting."
5,Great Book for African American Female and Male Travelers,"I think that this is the best book that I have read which features the thoughts and emotions of African American women travelers. Their shared experiences certainly helps me become more appreciative of them and not to take them for granted. As they travel the world, they are looked upon as beautiful, bold women. Certainly, the ""Go Girl"" Guide brings that out in each experience of these travel writers. As the author of The African American Travel Guide, I strongly feel that Elaine Lee has done an outstanding job in choosing the experiences of these particular women to help me understand and learn more about Black culture throughout the world. The guide also shows how the world reacts to us as Black people in a foreign culture. When will Elaine produce the ""Go Guy's"" travel guide for men - or maybe I should write that. Great job, Elaine."
2,Two parts nine,"2 1/2A few of these acoustic-indie electronic reinterpretations are interesting background, one or two really feel beautifully on the mark, but the most of these guest vocalists sound forgettable in that irrelevantly indulgent way."
5,one of this years best,Joan Plowright gives one of her best performances in this deeply effecting little film.. I love all of the characters staying in the hotel..every detail is surprisingly well done.. This is no Harold and Maude tale as others have noted but rather a story of two people who seem to understand each other in a way that even their closest relations do not.. It is charming right to the end - even if somewhat predictable..Joan Plowright has such a lovely presence and never has to force her acting at all - she is so natural and believable.. I am sure this movie will have a lasting power..
5,Golden,"If you want to leave the worries of every day and consider the intimate moments of a life lived well, consider this lovely little gem. Joan and her co-star will give you a delightful little getaway from the nasty and open a window into the sublime. Relationships should be so lovely!"
4,No Closed Captions or Subtitles! : (,"I wanted to watch this film with my elderly grandmother, who is hearing impaired. She is 93 years old, living in a retirement community, but very spunky! This film seemed perfect for her for various reasons. We were so disappointed when I put it and we discovered that it has no subtitles or close captions. I can't understand how a film lauded by the AARP, seemingly perfect for seniors, is not available with subtitles, which seem to be standard for most current DVD releases. Many seniors are hearing impaired, and would benefit by this added accessibility.I've been searching the internet for a version of this film with subtitles, but no luck.Does anyone know where I could find it? Or maybe it does not exist.Disappointing; but looks like a great film."
5,A real charmer,A charming film start to finish. Wonderful performances and a great story. I can't believe that this is Rupert Friend's first film - he's a natural.
3,"Good idea, badly done","This could have been a lovely movie, and with the wonderful Joan Plowright, should have been. But the script was terrible. This just seemed like a ""B"" movie to me, which surprised me. With a better script and better directing, this might have been great."
3,Family is what you make it...,"Mrs. Palfrey is a sweet entertaining film that moves a bit slowly, but the quality of the story and characters are better emphasized in that way. Joan Plowright is spectacular."
2,Senior follies,"This is a dreadfully dreary, predictable, sentimental, waste of time. Yes, the acting is fine, but the script for this low budget flop should have been tossed out on sight. Everything is a stereotype: the elderly are mentally defective and dying to be sexy and fun; the young hippy in the story is ever-so-sensitive and good; the ""words of wisdom"" by the major character (Plowright) are superficial to the point of being humorous. The ending is sloppy and witless...as the hippy moves on, no doubt trying to bed more girls while thinking wistfully of the old woman who...who what? What a waste. Harold and Maude was at least funny."
5,Want her for a Grandma,"What a delightful movie! I have had a Mrs. Palfrey in my own life and it is a memory and a friendship I will treasure always. This movie will always be one of my very favorites! In many ways it reminds me of ""Second-Hand Lions""...and the way friendships can span generations! I will recommend this movie to all of my friends and will thank AARP for bringing it to my attention!!! And I will watch it over and over...and remember my own Mrs. Palfrey every time. It is a great movie to watch with the kids and help them watch for THEIR Mrs. Palfrey! Dame Plowright and Rupert Friend are now 2 of my favorite actors. He was able to bring true friendship and love to this movie. It will also remind me to take more care at being a daughter so my own parents won't need a ""Ludo""!"
5,DVD,"Absolutely loved this DVD. Worth the price. I've watched at least 3 times already. Also a great DVD to share with older parents, grandparents, etc."
5,A must see,"Wonderful human interest story with stellar performances by all the actors. Proves that love comes in many ways, at any age and never dies."
5,"sweet, gentle, lovely","Mrs. Palfrey was a beautiful vehicle for Joan Plowright's talent. And Rupert Friend was not outshown. The two of them together made a perfect movie. Watching their friendship grow, and seeing the difference each made to the other's life, was very special. I sat at the end of the movie with tears falling freely down my face, not caring whether any family members walked in to see. You finish this movie with a deep sigh of satisfaction, and hours later, you find you are still thinking about it."
1,not as expected,This tape had a glitch in it.....It skipped a whole section of the movie..But by the time I got around to watch it I had forgotten who I purchased it from.....I then went on line and ordered another one.....
4,Nautica wallet,"I was buying other products online for myself, and decided to get a little something for my boyfriend. He needed a new wallet and so I chose this one. For the price and style, we both really like it. It was a little smaller than his other one though, but this wallet still has a lot of card holders. Overall, good product."
4,"Good, Durable","My husband really likes this wallet. It has a lot of card spaces which is nice. The only thing I didn't realize when I bought it, was that it has blue stiching above the Nautica logo. We didn't really like that detail, but other than that it's great"
2,"I don't like the kind of lither they use, its looked very cheap","I don't like the kind of lither they use, its looked very cheap, and its too thick.The credit card slots are also too tight - so you have to pry the cards in and out - and run the risk of cracking or splitting the cards."
5,VERY THIN...and PERFECT,"I was thinking in buying it or not because of the other reviews and I took the decision of buying it...and imaging what!..I was happy of this purchase.. The wallet is cute, thin, and have a beautiful color. My friend adore this wallet and he throw out the other one to use this."
2,Not a great wallet for the price,"This is a nice looking wallet, but the internal design leaves something to be desired.There is an internal flap used for credit cards, etc, that makes the wallet too thick - even if you don't fill it with cards. I am tempted to cut it out (it is stitched to the inside) to make the wallet less cumbersome.The credit card slots are also too tight - so you have to pry the cards in and out - and run the risk of cracking or splitting the cards.There is a nice display for your license - with a small hole cut in it so that you can push the license out with your thumb when needed (it is also in a tight slot)."
4,"Great, sturdy wallet","Great wallet with lots of extra slots sewn in for your cards and ID. If that's not enough, there is also a plastic insert to store more cards, but can be taken out if not needed. The wallet is also constructed using a sturdy quality leather--unlike some very thin/soft/limp leathers used on other wallets."
1,Thickness of an Average Credit Card > single slot given,"Pros : Good, sleek Design, with High quality Leather ( smells like one at least )Cons : NOTHING FITS ( THE SLOTS ARE UNEASY ( UNDERSTATING BELIEVE ME ) TO HOLD ANY KIND OF CCs )I have to write this review to say how disappointed i am with this product, it says credit card holder, i tried pulling in gold amex, green amex, visa and lots of other cards i have and none of them can fit in easily, when i try to fit in off course it comes in, but it feels like i am stuffing my cards in, ( with a **gulp** that they'll break or something ).My Advice,if you're looking for a sleek wallet to hold a few things in buy it, ( at least leather's good =) ) else DON'T DON'T DON'T!"
5,mans wallet,husband didnt want to give up his old holy wallet but when he seen the new he was glad i ordered it . fast delivery thanks
1,Husband hated it.,"I bought this wallet for my husband and after 5 minutes it went directly into the Goodwill box. It's HUGE for a trifold wallet, it looked like he had a baseball in his back pocket. It also has an internal zipper which makes the wallet lumpy and lopsided. It's also a flaming bright ORANGE fabric on the inside.Definitely not for him."
2,Not so impressed,"The good:The converter works (on non-copyrighted source material) to convert from DVD to MP4 that works on IPads and IPhones. It works a little faster than some I have used for the conversion.The bad:Not that surpringly, it does not work from copyrighted DVD's. Even with a non-copyrighted DVD the front end is messy. You have to look through all the DVD sub-files to pick the ones you want to incorporate and select ""merge"" - otherwise you wind up with a bunch of separate MP4 files.The worst:For the limitations I noted, the price is way too high."
5,Great All Around Product!!!!,"This company gets better every year. I had heard about them on google, and the torrent sites. The burn's work 100% of the time and every-time their is an update you are guaranteed to get a good burn on your dvd."
5,Lots of great recipes,I ordered this book to replace mine that was falling apart. It had seen a lot of use over the years. The book arrive in mint conditon in a timely manner. I am very pleased to have my replacement!
1,Cheap but short-lived,"I purchased this remote less than a year ago. It has had some problems being ""testy"" in the past, by which I mean that I needed to press buttons several times before they worked. It would also sometimes turn off the TV when I asked it to turn off the VCR and vice versa. Yesterday I tried using the remote, and it just did not work at all. I tried taking the batteries out and putting them back in, but now the light at the top that comes on when you press a button, will not light up.So I'm looking for a new, different remote. This one is fine if you commonly lose a remote or it gets chewed on by the dog. But if you want something that lasts, I would look elsewhere."
3,"Works fine, but on-off button problems after a few years","A simple, solid universal remote. We bought it to replace a dead TV remote. We didn't want anything fancy, and this worked great for about 3 years. Now the on-off button is getting hard to use, so we have to replace it."
5,"Good history, comprehensive Christian subjects","The Fountain of Catholic Knowledge, written 1897, at about 1,000 pages has the best account of Christopher Columbus I've read. Cardinal Newman's response to Gladstone's bigotry against Irish Catholics is riveting because it is entirely factual, dispassionate and demolishes every Gladstone assertion. There are many accounts of lives of Saints, explanation of Church worship, prayer, the entirety of Catholic belief, religious practice and history. Some shall quibble about ""indulgences."" I value this text for what it contains about history as written by popes, scholars, and anonymous contributors. There is nothing I know of that says so much between two covers. I highly recommend it for its scholarship and general historical interest."
4,great movie! but give it time to grow on you!,"At first, I did not like the film as much. It was not what I expected!But eventually, it grew on me. Only because I gave it a chance.OK, most people need to instantly love it or hate it. I wanted to love it , and it worked.Some amazing scenes, shot exquisitely, great acting, true-to-life plot BUT with some twists ;--]]Yes, I love foreign movies, I like Norway, and when I saw the Bergen train station in real life, it made me feel great!Give Mr. Horten a chance. He might end up warming your heart.By the way, two other great films from Norway are 'buddy' and 'elling'. I recommend them very much!"
2,Slow and boring,"O Horten depicts a persons attempt to cope with retirement. Odd Horten is a train engineer and has been driving for many years, always punctual and bound by routine fails to arrive on time for his last train ride. Faced with retirement he wanders aimlessly trying to make a sense of the void that retirement has left him with and in the process encounters many odd characters. These meetings and his interaction form the basis of the movie. The mood of the movie is pretty melancholy and remains that way from the beginning to the end. There are many situations where I thought the action was going to get interesting but did not. The director has tried to show the sadness of a retired man without a family and he certainly succeeds but without the emotional grip. I liked the photography and especially the first scene when Odd is driving the train through a frozen land. Beautiful....The movie was not just not that great for me. I gave it two stars. 2/22/10"
2,Slow Motion,"Very slow moving and subtle film that depends on the quirkiness of its characters to make the viewing experience meaningful. Although there are some intermittently amusing moments, this movie unfolds at a snail-like pace and requires a good deal of patience. Which is unfortunately hard to come by in today's fast-moving society."
5,Beautiful Book with Invaluable Content,"Of all of Newmarket's wonderful series of Pictorial Moviebooks, this one is my favorite. The sidebars identifying many of the ""real people"" who appear in the film are helpful, but the best part is the side-by-side comparison of the paintings & the moments in Frida's life which inspired them. The wedding sequence is especially illuminating: the scene from the shooting script, the stills of Frida [Salma Hayek] examining herself in the mirror in her lace wedding gown, & the picture of the actual wedding painting all combine to reveal Frida's essential self-invention.If you loved this film, you will definitely want THIS book which supplements BOTH the film & the Herrera biography."
5,Frida,"Because of this amazing book, I started a journey through Mexico that has changed my life. The life of Frida Kahlo inspired me to learn Spanish, change my teaching postion, and start a non-profit organization. Rarely does a novel infuse itself into one's consciousness, motivating social change. Thank you Ms. Herrera for this priceless treasure."
5,About as good as it gets,"I attended this show. Awesome show.DVD is pretty sweet. Best thing probably short of being there.Very fun and wonderful love it.The good news is that this is NOT a typical ""LIVE"" production with ridiculous noise from audience. Some people may not like that, but I think it works for my enjoyment.The sound is awesome and amazing. The singers voices are probably drowned out a bit compared to live. Again, that is okay with me but others may not like it.if you didn't get to go, get this is.if you want to enjoy Thievery Corporation again and again and live with the sound, lights, and beats. get it."
2,Yikes,"Maybe it's the voice used by the actress on the audio, or maybe it's the prose itself, but I felt like this was an overdramatic telling of a good, basic, universal story of newfound love and loss. Supporting character Susan/Snow seemed particularly cliched and immature, and therefore irritating. I wouldn't recommend this."
2,For what purpose?,This book is a variation on a theme from those published by Deborah Tannen. Debbie's books are by far superior.
1,Too Much Sterotyping,"What I like about this book is the different ways men and women express themselves. However, I find that there are too much sterotyping in the book. In addition, the author doesn't seen to take cultural and ethnic backgrounds into consideration."
1,Stay away from this card. it doesn't work,"It barely accomplishes the minimum requirement of a TV tuner card.That being, it shows tv on your pc.There's a bunch of cards that do that, and more, at the same price.Free remote, $10 shipping. If it's not free, don't say it's free!Electronic Program Guide does not work and will not work. Tech support is useless. No new drivers or software will ever be made available.Without an EPG, what's the point? How can I schedule recording shows without a guide?My brother and I both bought this card and both came to the same conclusion. It doesn't work, never did, never will. ATI Lies and is selling a product that does not do what it promises to do.When you call tech support, they're either not available, not answering, on holiday, or just don't know how to help.Stay away from everything ATI!"
1,Terrible,"The box says it's Windows Vista upgradable and the website says it's compatible. This is false. When I tried to install from the CD, it just stated that it didn't detect any devices on my pc when I tried the custom mode, and when I did it using the standard way, the program just froze up every time I tried to use it. It is completely incompatible with Windows Media Center, which is why I upgraded to Vista in the first place. The ""updated"" files on the website won't detect the card either, and the drivers aren't even listed on the drivers page. I did get the drivers to install once when I told Windows to search for them on the CD, but the software still says it doesn't detect any hardware. Even the few people I've read about that got it to work said it had poor quality. Do yourself a favor and avoid this one, despite the low price."
1,Poor Product,"I too purchased and installed this card. It utilized every bit of available CPU resources, poor quality video and when shutting down the software, hung up, locking up the box. Further, there are too many programs that are required to run in the background in order for this product to function."
1,AVOID!,"Hardware: It's an antiquated TV Wonder re-named to keep it in the market. The Picture Quality is poor to fair. It is NOT Windows MCE Compatible.Hardware: 1 star""Free"" Remote: It's NOT Free. You have to pay an inflated S&H; charge for it to be sent to you. By the way, they will not send you a 2nd ""Free"" remote if you've bought more than one TV Wonder. (One per household?)""Free Remote"" Fiasco: 2 Stars, only because it is a nice remote.Software: The included Catalyst Media Center is so bad, it's basically MALWARE. It can cause serious system problems and is nearly impossible to completely remove. This is a BIG problem, because you can't use this card with Windows Media Center Edition.Software: ZERO StarsConclusion: Inferior Hardware packaged with REALLY BAD Software, AND You have to pay for the ""Free"" Remote!I love most ATI Products, but not this one! Avoid like the PLAGUE."
5,A profound contemplation and mediation of differing specifics in pursuit of a general goal,"Written by a theologist who teaches in the Christianity and Culture Program at Saint Michael's College, University of Toronto, Spiritual But Not Religious? An Oar Stroke Closer to the Farther Shore, is an exploration of diversely plural religious beliefs. Inviting the contemplative individual to consider institutions such as the Christian church and other religious institutions not as obstacles to knowing faith, but as rafts that gradually bring one an oar stroke closer to the farthest shore. A profound contemplation and mediation of differing specifics in pursuit of a general goal - reverence and love for the Divine."
2,More of the same.....,"If you have seen other Gatas Sandungueras videos you will not see anything diferent in this one. A lot of repetitive material from other videos two new girls showing NOTHING, just dancing and no more. Pretty Lame video....."
2,Las Putas Sucias De Genio Records,"this dvd sucks, the girls have horrible facesthe dancing is repetitive it eventually gets boringthe only good thing about this dvd are the songs on the videos"
4,Shipping Charges,"I was happy to find this item and planned to order several. However, when I saw the shipping charges for about 6 of them was over $10. I only ordered one of each type. If I had ordered a dozen shipping charges of $10. is still way too much."
5,one night to be sinful,loved this story read it in a couple of hours couldn't put it down i just wanted to know what happened next and couldn't want till the main characters had there happy ever after
1,One star is too many!,"OK, that's a little harsh. One star is probably not too many for a movie that isn't really a ""movie"" in the sense of having a coherent plot, credible dialogue, minimal acting skills, etc. ""Roller Boogie"" would have made a perfect Charlie's Angels episode -- in fact, it did, when Jaclyn, Farrah and Kate (or their stunt doubles) donned their four-wheel, suede-booted skates and chased the bad guys down Venice Beach.But the Angels were the Angels; everything they did was in the greater service of looking good, acting very little, and trying not to laugh their way through ridiculous plots. ""Roller Boogie"", on the other hand, offers us Queen of the B's Linda Blair surrounded by a bevy of nonactors, a raft of horrendous disco songs (this stuff makes the Bee Gees sound like great art), and endless choreographed disco-on-skates numbers. Round, and round, round and round the kids skate. And the bad guys lose at the end.How did we ever survive the 80's?"
1,Another Great Bad Movie!,"This has always been my favorite ""bad movie"". From the opening roller disco scene where they ""boogie"" on their skates all over LA, to the bad flute playing. This movie is a real hoot. Although Linda Blair is very cute, she is a bit on the chunky side for mainstream movies. Her love interest, is just a bit ""fey"" and petite if you ask me. By the ending sequence, during the big roller disco contest, you can just about see the guy wires enabling him to toss her around and over as if she is light as a feather. Of course you have your requisite bad guys--the guy that played Don in Lost In Space--and the clueless parents who don't understand their misunderstood daughter--this just makes it a ""Must See""."
4,should be a cult movie,"If you like roller skating and cheesy lines, this is a great movie to watch. This is my family's favorite movie. You can see Linda Blair in one of her earliest films. Roller Boogie shows awesome roller skating moves and Venice Beach, CA. After renting this movie, we went on a search to find it. It was finally found in a video store in New York City. I even have the original movie poster in my room. I hope you enjoy the movie. ITS FUN, BUT YOU HAVE TO JUST LAUGH AT THE CHEESYNESS OF IT. HAVE A BALL"
3,Dance Of Freedom,"I am a twenty-nine year old female, who watched this movie many years ago. It is one of those movies that just seems to stick with you and is very much like Xanadu or other dance movies of that genre.I am sorry to see that the video is not available and wish it would be re-released. It is one of the oldies but goodies; and even today, I think it would stand the test of time.In my opinion, it's a great expression of a teen's freedom through the art of roller dancing. Linda Blair also looks very beautiful in the movie, outfits are nice, music is nice, etc.I think everyone should see it."
5,a wonderful childhood memory,"WHEN I WAS IN 5TH GRADE, MYSELF AND SEVERAL FRIENDS WENT AND SEEN THIS MOVIE EVERY WEEKEND WHILE IT WAS SHOWING. I HAVE LOOKED FOR THIS MOVIE FOR ALONG TIME AND HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND IT, PLEASE RE-RELEASE IT. WHEN I THINK OF IT I THINK OF ALL MY FRIENDS FROM SCHOOL"
4,Good movie about the 70s rollerskating revolution!!!,"If you were ever into the rollerskating craze during the seventies, this movie is for you. I wax nostalgic because this movie was ""during my time."" It has good scenes from inside the rink, good scenes from the Venice Beach, California beachfront skating, and a good variety of disco dance music. There is also a good 70s soundtrack that is available if you like the disco skating beat. I really liked the acting, even though Jim Bray was really a skating competitor, his acting was a little 'corny' but considering that he was NOT an actor, really a skater. A reasonable price for a decent movie about kids trying to save the fate of their local hang-out. Can't find many movies like this anymore, or kids this wholesome. If you like rollerskating, in any fashion, this movie is for you."
4,Fun Movie,I loved this movie as a kid and love it still. It is cheesy fun and will enjoy watching it again.
5,Fantastic,This is a fantastic movie and more movie should be made like this FAMILY MOVIE not what is out there.and you should get this back out on Rental so people can see it.
5,The Integral Yoga by Sri Aurobindo,This is an excellent book for anyone who is interested in universal principles that reaches beyond the worlds great religions. Aurobindo is masterful at presenting the material in a relevant and user friendly fashion. I will use this book as a resource for my Science of Mind classes and share it in my enewsletters.
3,It is a toy,It doesn't look very real. That is okay because I bought it as a gift and not as a movie prop.
4,Laptop briefcase,"Good product. It replaces my computer backpack which I was getting too old for. The only problem is that it doesn't quite fit under the seat in an airplane, so I have to store it up above."
2,Watch out. You'll want to hide this one.,"I don't really consider myself a prude but this is really one of the most tasteless things I've ever bought anywhere, much less on Amazon.This is not something you'll want your kids to see.. or even see that you own it.I don't suppose it was the acronyms as much as the cartoons depicting some of the acronyms. Yeccchh!Don't completely trust the description on this one... it's not as clever as it seems, just gross."
2,Very graphic illustrations-not for a moral person,"I am a young,public librarian and am open to just about anything. I order most anything for our collection. I ordered this book thinking my patrons would really enjoy a good humor book. I was appalled by the illustrations and will not put this on my shelf! Please be careful and make sure this is really what you want."
4,NCIS: LA,this show has promise... it is interesting to see how they implemented the lessons that they have learned with NCIS into this show in regards to charactersI enjoyed watching the series from the first episode to the last episode
5,NCIS Season 1,Awesome show and love to be able to watch the episodes from the season from start to finish. Love it!
1,One of the worst tv shows,"NCIS is one of the worst TV shows I have seen. It is incredible fool. LL Cool J is not an actor. He looks so stupid playing the tough guy... As Hety, Linda Hunt looks awful. Her small size and her ""brilliant mind"" are not a good combo. She is so unrealistic... Finally Daniela Ruah. Her black eye look evil."
4,season 1,"This particular season had a slow start with the characters, but i can tell you it gets better in the season ahead so it is worth watching"
5,It's a great spin off,"It's a great spinoff!!! Bought this for my son and I , we love both NCIS's and this first season is great."
3,just ok,It was a good episode but nothing outstanding. It was good quality viewing. The video and audio were good and actually synced unlike other shows.
1,CSET Social Science 7-12,"Poorly written study guide for CSET social studies preparation. The book has numerous grammatical, spelling, and factual errors. There are no California specific historical questions that you would expect to find in a study guide oriented towards a CSET test for California. Instead you will find several questions oriented towards Florida. I agree with other reviewers that I could probably write a better book myself. Disappointing, especially in view of the price. My recommendation: buy Advanced Placement guides in individual topic areas such as World History, U.S. History, Economics, etc."
4,SUZANNE CIANI-NEW AGE PIANO,"I bought this book after hearing ""Neverland"" and being caught by the interesting melody. To my surprise, my favorite in the book turned out to be ""Tuscany"" and bitersweet, haunting melody that has enraptured me. Her music is very simple, very repetitious and predictable but still a good read and allows a pianist to infuse his or her own expression to the piece."
5,Rocks!,"For those of you who like ""linear"" RPGs, where your path is set and NPCs tell you everything you must do, look elsewhere. If you like to wander around, get lost in the world exploring and fighting, this is the game for you. HUGE map, with 2 different 'worlds' to explore, loads of caves, tons of monsters, hidden weapons, spells, etc. (the pirate treasure side quest is truly awesome; you look for pieces of the map scattered over the world) Travel by land, sea, and even air! . Then, when you've had your fun, go ahead and try to beat the game =]"
4,"This is the real thing, folks.","How much did I like this album?So much I contacted the artist and spent weekends filming my first music video of ""Reviving"", the title track.I think it speaks of Daniel's sincerity as an artist, that he agreed to do the ""Reviving"" video when others felt more commercially viable tunes should be used - as the director, I disagreed.""Reiviving"" the video played in film festivals this year (2005) and now is on MTV's Logo as a One-off video after movies etc.We did this video with no budget- but again, Daniel is more than a singer and songwriter- he is a riveting performance artist- which is why, in my opinion, this video approaches video art in the truest sense of all that it entails.If you yearn for a fresh take on folk-rock blended with pop and electronica- buy this record.You will not be disappointed.[...]"
3,Earlier WAS better....,"Unfortunately, I agree with the reviewer below to some degree. Just listen to the samples for this CD and compare to the ones on his earlier release, ""Wide Outside,"" and you will find what's missing on ""Revival""'s overproduced snarkiness.""Wide Outside"" is a collection of home studio recordings, demos and live performances that put you right inside the singer's heart; quite touching. It's where you should start with Cartier."
2,"Over produced, a bit off key, trite, nothing's changed","Listen carefully and you will hear moments of vocal talent, but too often Cartier goes off key and struggles with notes. I had a hard time hearing a consistent genuine connection between the artist and his lyrics. Have known this guy for a long time, and believe in his talent, but believe his very early cassette releases showed a more sincere, less fussy artist of true quality. A couple of the songs on this disc appeared in different versions on those early cassettes; get your hands on a copy if you can and take a listen to ""Fall on Me"" as it was originally recorded--stark, heartfelt, compelling. Too bad the bad habits Cartier picked up while trying to get a deal with a major label years ago seem to have stuck with him."
4,a light read,"This story starts off very good. It grabbed me and made me keep reading. I am not a big fan of first person narrative, but was able to get into the main character of this one. The mystery has several layers (albeit thin ones). Just wehen you think you have it figured out, something else happens. Although parts of the book were pretty predictible, I did like how the past kept influencing the present. I did like how the author brought the papacy up to date and allowed for the priests to be fallible. A good book if you are looking for something light to read."
3,Interesting but ultimately disappointing,"Suspension of disbelief, a key component of good fiction, is at times working well here, but all too often fails to take hold as the believable and exciting action scenes are interspersed with scarcely believable scenes cut from an Arnold Shwarzenegger mold. Superhero cops and popes undo the effort at characterization and atmosphere that would make this otherwise trite and silly tale a work of quality. Too bad Mr. Montalbano will not get the opportunity to rise to the heights of a Martin Cruz Smith or dare I say it John Grisham. For there are signs throughout this novel of a masterful storyteller grappling with inane drivel, waiting to emerge and display his true forte. It was an interesting but disappointing read."
2,Mediocre at best......,"This book was ok......The main character is too over the top. I mean come on, how many ex-cop bad-boys can there really be. He is weapons master that can save your life or kill you. Sounds to me like someone is envious of Marchinko. Anyway.... luckily the plot was interesting because the characters were definately no good. The pope was supposed to be an attractive middle aged man? Please that will never happen....If you want to read this one get it from a used book store and save yourself some cash."
4,Mystery in St. Peter's...,"The Roman setting being somewhat familiar to me, I was pleasantly surprised at the detail Montalbano was able to include in his story. He clearly was a careful observer, and likely a studious note-taker, and this book is that much more an enjoyable, and even whimsical read, thanks to his journalistic skills. He has written with a strong sense of reality, just slightly ahead of our time, and with some really nifty twists to the plotline. For readers who enjoy the novels of Father Andrew Greeley, and other church-related mystery stories, I highly recommend this book, possessing as it does a marvelous sense of how things do tend to work in the higher echelons of the Vatican...minus the actual murders, of course! This is a very pleasurable and engaging read. The tragedy is that there will be no more from William Montalbano."
3,Plotting History,"Will Eisner's last graphic novel is a curio, not a gesture of fantasy but rather an act of historical reconstruction, tracing the story of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, the Tsarist fabrication that was picked up by antisemites ranging from the German Nazis to Henry Ford to more recent Arab propagandists bent on demonizing ""world Jewry."" The book is a noble struggle against the persistence of irrational bigotry. But ""The Plot"" lacks any emotional wallop; genre and subject have not been suitably matched."
4,a bit hard to follow at the beginning...,"but well-done at its core: I think the side-by-side comparison of the Protocols and the work it was plagiarized from is by far the most compelling part of the book. However, I did have some trouble keeping the characters straight at the start of the book."
5,"Lies, D**m Lies, and Propaganda","If you loved Maus and works like that, you will be blown away by Eisner's final work. In it, he meticulously follows the path of the Protocols of Zion and goes about debunking them at every turn.More importantly, he's able to shine a light into why they continue to hold such a strong power over people even after 100+ years.Eisner's work is as clear as ever, making this an excellent ""gateway"" book to people who are not used to graphic novels. The extensive use of an index and bibliography show us how much research went into it and the introduction by Umberto Eco will draw in many people who haven't touched a ""comic book"" since they were teens.I think after reading this work, they might change their minds some. I just wish Eisner had survived to see how well this was received."
4,The Plot; a Forerunner to Mein Kamph,"This animated approach to an old story about a world-wide Jewish plot totake over the entire world is as chilling as it is artful. Will Eisner isquite talented in his ability to render figures in animated form. His re-telling of this nineteenth century story familiarizes us with the materialthat Adolph Hitler no doubt utilized in his own concoction of a worldwideJewish take-over plot as described in the latter's work, Mein Kamph.This book should be a requirement for those who are serious students ofthe Holocaust, of sociology, and of anti-Semetic written works."
2,not what I expected,"This is simply a catalog of plans you can buy. I wouldn't pay for a Sears catalog of things to buy. It also has a list of related articles in Woodenboat magazine that can be ordered.I am looking for imformation on how to build a boat, not looking to buy a book on where to buy imformation on how to build a boat."
1,Want to buy a product catalog,This book is great for people that would like to build a sail boat. of the 50 designs in the book 90% of them are sailboats. Also the book itself does not contain any building plans whatsoever. It's a product catalogue for Wooden Boat. So if you want to pay for their catalog go ahead. I bought this looking for some simple boat plans that I could build with the kids on the weekend. I received a catalog for the plans. if I want to build one of them I have to pay for the plans. So all I received was a product catalog. Do not waste your money on this just go to their website ( http://www.woodenboatstore.com/ ) to get the same information.
5,ITS ALL IN THE TITLE........,"""Dance Music for a New Generation""; and that's precisely what Tazmania ""Freestyle"" is. As far as I am concerned, this series of compilations has bred a truley unique and memorable series of artists and songs. Hard slamming beats and lyrics touch the heart and soul. And most of these artists can sing too! Check out Stefanie Bennett's ""Don't Let Me Go"" and ""Never Too Late"". Pure Pleazure is awesome with ""I Need You Now"", and ""When Will You Come Back to Me""....these two guys can sing! This is the first cd in the compilation and has been out since 1993, so pick it up before one day you may not be able to. This cd is a must for your collection."
5,fabulous sophomore album,"this is an fantastic effort on Shannon's part... co-writing 11 of the 13 tracks on this album is not something to be sneezed at hehe, it's truly hard for me to pick a fav... and i have actually listened to all the songs from this album not just the ones released as singles... do i sound suspicious of some reviewer? hmm... well i am lmaogive it away... down on me... losing it all... all i want is more... this is it ... letter to you... before we say goodbye ... the list of fabulous & varied styles of songs goes on & on... these are but a fewi highly recommend this album to anyone who is interested in contempory adult soft rock/pop/rockyou only live once... so grab yourself a copy"
1,mmmm i must be listening to something else!,I cannot believe that there are 7 good reviews on this guy. He cannot sing...... he screeches. To say is the 'best' is the biggest overstatement I have heard in a very long time.I am tired of hearing his screeching winey voice on the airwaves of australian radio.I hope he doesn't impose himself on the Americans ...... beware!
5,The best fighting game with more characters!,This game is a lot faster and there are more characters. I can't think of a better game than this. My advice is buy this game!
3,All hail Skip,"I must thank mr. calt for his dedication to mr.james for he deserves all the credit and acclaim that he can get. through out the book I got the feeling that mr.calt was letting his personal judgement concerning mr.james get in the way of an acurate representation. most of the character jugements so often hinted at throughout this biography seem to come from calt's experiences with the man towards the end of his life. Lets all remember Mr. calt what a genius [as John hurt has called the man] really means. I'm sure dieing of cancer and not reciveing your due during your lifetime would make anyone bitter. I hope there are others out there who wait for anything to read about such a person and if so, this is a good place to start"
4,good info and recipes,Very helpful information and some great recipes in here. We were surprised at how much we like it. Well worth the price (which we thought was quite low)
3,israeli rock,this was popular when it came out in the early 1990s. its general hard rock with all hebrew lyrics. a good album with catchy songs that paved the way for their more experimental later albums.
3,Great set. Bad mix,"OK, this is a fantastic set. Buy the DVD instead. The sound mix is 100 times better."
2,potente pero con un sonido deficiente,El disco tiene fuerza pero le falla la calidad de grabación. es una pena
5,Rage at their best!,There is no band ever that can compete with the intensity that Zack de la Rocha brings in live performances. This album is a must.
2,A Sad Trek...,"There are two SNES Star Trek games and this is the worst one! Not very innovative nor full of action and it has an impossible to figure out passcode system. But, I must say that it is finnaly a SNES game based-on-show game that is not a platformer. That's the only reason I give it 2 stars"
3,A good faux Ellery Queen novel.,"The novel was written by Jack Vance and doesn't have Ellery Queen as a character.The story takes place in the mid 1960's in California. It's always interesting toread stories that occur in California when it was truly "" The Golden State "", before it became the relatively poor - 31st in cost-of-living-adjusted median household income - and overcrowded mexicanized mess it is today.Vance's characterization of his protaganist, Inspector Collins, is well done and the investigation is fascinating.The ending is similar to a John Dickson Carr novel."
5,Excellent Book,If you want to know about leadership theory then this book is for you. Not only does the book explain each theory it also provides real life case studies for you to enhance your knowledge. There are even some leadership surveys included that you can take to assist you in determining your leadership style. The organization of this book is excellent and it is easy to read. I highly recommend it.
1,Leadership poor examples,"When a leader has to contrive situations to get their staff to follow them, they are not very good leaders. When an author and consultant advises such methods, as this author does at least twice, they are not very good consultants and shouldn't be publishing serious advice but offerening instead a book about what not to do."
1,TJ Review 2,"Item was never sent, and notification of non-fulfillment was not received until I inquired on the last day of the receipt window. Very dissatisfied, as this was a book for a class and I went through most of the class without it."
5,"Great book on Leadership, especially for a Textbook","This book is the Required text for a senior level Leadership in Human Resource Development class, and it is excellent. It reads like a ""normal"" book, and really gives good descriptions of each topic. It's a little expensive for a softcover book at $55, but as far as a text goes, I think it's really good."
1,BORING,"I hated this book. It was part of the most boring class and the reading is extremely boring. It was pared, in my class, with nonsense quizzes that ask the most odd questions."
2,Ridiculously small,"It looks great, but you cannot fit much in it at all, not even a single binder (seriously)..."
5,FANTASTIC BAG!,"this is a really SUPER day-pack! if you're looking for a regular backpack to haul loads of books and your laptop around campus, this is not gonna be your first choice- it definitely won't hold more than a couple of textbooks and a notebook or two, and the only size computer you could fit would be a netbook. I purchased this bag to use as a day-pack in Disney World, and it was the best I could have ever hoped for! I managed to catch it on sale, and really, it holds a lot more than you would think! and the secret sunglass pocket was big enough to hold my phone, camara, ipod AND my shades."
3,pretty! but practical?,I love the colors and design but i can't fit a lot of books or my laptop in it.
4,Snows of Ganymede War of the Winged men,"I was disappointed with the seller because the listing in amazon was for a book with two novels in it, Snows of Ganymede and War of The Winged Men... The book I received only had one novel. Which was War of The Winged Men. The story was a good story however."
1,Opti-glow cable review,"This opti cable broke two of my cable box opti source inputs, careful when installing and uninstalling. The head is not shaped like a normal Opti, at first i thought it might not fit, but it did really snug and it broke my opti inputs on both cable boxes and my new Samsung 3D tv. I guess you get what you pay for. It does work however, but you must tape it on to get it to connect since it broke my inputs."
1,A REAL BORING GAME!,In this game you have to put little babies into houses by using magical powers.I think some people should stay away from this game!
2,"Yes, Phoenix had Rock Music in the 60's","Not worth all the money. I grew up in Phoenixand was looking forward to reading this book.I got 20 minutes of nostalgia and nothing else.The text could have fit more neatly as an articlein a ""Phoenix"" type of Magazine.Mitch Gries"
4,Brings it all back home,"As one of those that was there in the 1960's (going to Washington High) and performing in our own (My Brother Gary and I)Garage Bands ""The Darkest Corner"" and ""Slade Brown"" this book wraps it's arms around my teenage years. If you were at the ""VIP club"", hung out at ""Chris Town"" mall, The Jewish Community Center, The Encanto Park Bandshell or any of the other Teen hang outs in Phoenix during the 1960's, I'm sure it will do the same for you."
5,Excellent,"I bought this set of CD's from a bookstore about five years ago. I still listen to it repeatedly. I almost have it memorized.It is not for everyone. It has lots of big words and is difficult to follow. You won't get it the first, second, or even the third time. Following it is a mental exercise and requires your full attention. The narrator moves through it quickly, but not raced. The vocabulary is immense. You should Google the book by Gibbon and read some passages first to see if it's your thing.However, saying that alone doesn't give it justice. The narrator, Philip Madoc, adds so much that listening to the book is a pleasure even if you've lost comprehension of what he is saying."
4,Lots of Info,"Tremendous amount of information and lots of historical data. Problem is the guy who wrote the book can speak the real english language and I often thought I was listning to a foreign language tape. I learned a lot and woud recomend this to anyone who wonders how something as great as the empire was, fell apart. Great learning experience."
5,Love it love it love it...,"I have seriously been reading the days just to get the information :)... A beautifully put together perpetual calendar, that im sure I will wear IN lol... Love it!!!!"
3,"Much good, little great","3 1/2Plenty of mellow progressions to enjoy, but perhaps too low key for its own good."
2,already torn!,"I gave this as a gift for Christmas and one month later it is already torn. Since it is made for outdoor use, you would think it would last more than 1 month!"
3,Poorly made toy,This toy is very poorly made. The logs tip and jam where they shouldn't.It does not last very long when being played with by a child!
4,Good sound,"I purchased for my work computer. Look good, sound good and perfect for CD's and online video."
1,I thought I was ordering computer speakers!!!,"I recieved gaming speakers. I was searching for ""computer speakers"" on the amazon site. I was very dissapointed to find that the speakers I received will not work on my computer!! Why would speakers come up on a search that was clearly for computer use, not work on a computer???What to do now???"
1,dissent,"Reading the other reviews of this CD compels me to write one of my own. If you liked progression through unlearning (or designs for that matter), save yourself the time, effort and money and just slam your face into a wall until blood comes out. I'm all for bands going in new directions, but I feel about as tricked as expecting Cave In's ""Jupiter"" to be anything other than the meadow-prancing, unicorn hug-fest that it was. The beat, drive and energy of Snapcase's past albums just aint in this one and they seem to be getting a little too artsy. The upside is, I like being angry and energetic when I listen to music, and all the crappy techno definitely leaves me enervated. Out of deference to their past efforts, I listened to the whole thing--and then threw the f*cker out my car window. I guess if you like Minus the Bear and wear sandals, buy this one."
5,"Great CD, go buy it!",I've been a fan of Snapcase for a long time now and this cd just proves that they still can make a great cd. I know there have been doughts about them but this cd proves that they are truly pioneers of the indy scene.
5,A Stella like troll!! LUV HER!,"I luv Stella of Winx Club and Topaz is just like her!Here are my pluses and minuses:+ She looks like Stella+ She acts like Stella+ Her clothes are stylin'+/- Her face has a sort of ""expresion""- the belly+++ SHE JUST LIKE ME!!!!**Princess Stella Topaz**I want my seson 2 Stella doll, Topaz troll, and Panda Pullip NOW!"
3,Not as good as Emprie Strikes First,"I have been a BR fan for almost 15 years, and was amazed by their last album (Empire Strikes First). They tried something new with that album which I loved. The lyrics where strong and clear. This album takes a step back when it comes to production value. The lyrics are great but hard to understand. There is alot of static and the riffs are not constant. This is the first time in a while where I had to pull out the lyric sheet to see what was being said. It is not there worst album but after there last I had real high expectations. They did not meet it with this. Now if you are a BR fan get is a no brainier. If you are new to BR I suggest getting Empire Strikes First or New America or Against the Gain (the one that started me on BR)."
3,Only for fans,"I am a big fan of bad religion.Unfortunately this record just doesn't have anything new or interesting on it. I have had it on my ipod for months now and honestly can barely remember any of the songs. Nothing memorable.With that said, if you are a fan, you will like this one also. Just don't expect anything great."
2,Disappointment,"What a disappointment this record! I am a HUGE Bad Religion fan, and was stoked to pick up the new release. Was very disappointed in this record. First off, each track doesn't come off as individual. Every track seems to blend into the next with no discernable differences amongst them. I do like how they've gone to a more ""Minor"" tone to each track, but overall they all sound basically the same.The biggest complaint I have with this record is with the mixing. Greg's vocals get swallowed up by the production. Too many times the guitars and harmony vocals completely drown out the lead vocal. So much to the point where things tend to sound ""muddy"". I much prefer to hear Greg's vocals distinctly above the rest of the production. Not sure what they did differently this time, but there are WAY too many times when Greg's vocals are indistinguishable.Whoever did the sound editing on this one should be shot!"
5,still alive,"a long time ago me and my friends were joking that you can always rely on BR to give you more of what you like. Honestly, looking back, Suffer, No Control and Against the Grain might as well have been recorded in one session. Now things are certainly a tad different. Gotta listen to the CD a couple of times first before you start to like it; very un-BR like.Overall, great CD, I did like Empire a tad more but I might change my mind in a few weeks.The mix, yes, very unusual, yes, we would like to have the vocals float above the music just like we are used to from the ""old"" albums. but luckily there is a solution. . . Play it LOUD!!!! Honestly, it helps.Punk Rock ... play it loud remember?"
3,Disappointed :(,"I have been a huge bad religion fan from the beginning, but this latest album falls short of some of there better work.The production values are way down from there last album, the lyrics are muddy and hard to hear.If you're a big bad religion fan like me (I have all there CD's and DVDs) this is a must have. If your new to the band pick upAgainst the GrainorThe Empire Strikes Firstfirst."
4,Another Solid Bad Religion Album...,"While not quite as inspired or adventurous as their last two albums The Process of Belief and The Empire Strikes First, New Maps of Hell is yet another worthy addition to the Bad Religion catalog. The sound is classic Bad Religion and is even reminiscient of some of their earlier harder edged albums like Against The Grain. Bad Religion fans will not be disappointed with this album. Songs like New Dark Ages and Honest Goodbye fit right in with the best that Bad Religion has ever released. The only complaint that I have is with the mix. It must be on purpose, but it just seems like this album was mixed much more dirty than any of their other recent releases. The vocals tend to get lost a bit. It's mostly a minor complaint. The album is still very good by any standards. It is great to see that after 27 years and 14 full length albums that Bad Religion still has something to say."
5,Lots of fun at the holiday table,"I bought this, along with Christmas Carol Mad Libs, for my two boys, age 8 and 10. We brought them out on Thanksgiving after dinner and before dessert when everyone was too full to get up :) EVERYONE had a great time playing Mad Libs. Each boy got a turn to go around the table and ask each person in turn for the noun or verb or whatever was required, and then read back the story they created. We all loved it, and the rest of us were adults! I don't know how long we sat around playing but dessert ended up being served later than planned - no one wanted to stop. I will be purchasing more for this year's Thanksgiving. We're having more kids this year and each one will find a Mad Libs book at their place setting. We may not get dessert until midnight."
4,Kids Love These,"I was surprised at how small these books are and how thin the pages are. I had pictured something a little more substantial for the price, but I know my Grandson will love them. There are several different subjects, I ordered the Christmas Fun and Kid Libs as a gift."
4,Fun!,This book was a lot of fun! Bought it as a fun/joke Christmas activity for adults. We enjoyed it! It's great for a group activity if you want to chat too.
4,Very Funny,"Bought and used this item for a office Christmas Party. It was very funny, will continue to use over the coming years."
4,Great insight into Deans movie career,"This is an outstanding book for both avid James Dean fans as well as classic movie buffs. It gives a lot of insight into this enigmatic man who has continued to inspire people and influence movie making, even long after his death. My only disapointment was the fact that the book only shows his three ""big"" movies; East of Eden, Giant and Rebel Without a Cause. It would have been nice if the authors had included some of his television work and the other movies where he didn't have a lead role. Nonetheless, the book is well worth the price and I highly recommend it."
4,Vicious Delite- a wonderful delight it is,"I don't know how I didn't hear this sooner, it came out in 1995 originally with this full length CD version coming out in 2000. I love this CD & highly recommend any RATT/Pearcy fan to check it out. I'm not saying it sounds exactly like RATT cause it doesn't, it's heavier & a bit darker so it's current with the time it came out but I'd stop well short of calling it ""grungy"". It just rocks."
1,not even worth $2,"I'm a recently minted Doctor Who fan, and well entrenched in that stage of it where I'm very excited about seeing ALL THE THINGS related to the Doctor.And I still couldn't get past 5 minutes of this. The animation is so bad that watching it actually makes it harder to understand what anybody is saying. Let's keep cell shading for the videogames, please. The audio is so bad, I couldn't tell if it was really David Tennant or a voice actor trying to sound like him.There's only one episode of this to watch, and it's obvious why."
3,Nice to see/hear Tennant,"This is O.K., but just. The animation is crude and unable to portray any of Tennant's facial expressions, which are a big part of his Dr. Who persona. I enjoyed hearing him again but I would recommend this only for a die hard fan. The story is pure Who and I found myself wishing they had made this into a standard episode."
3,"Great Dr. Who adventure, terrible animation and audio","The script is a wonderfully expansive and a good example of a rollicking Dr. Who adventure. Sadly, the animation is stiff and the audio mixing is atrocious. The voice acting and the script is well executed and I hope they remaster this with better audio. The script deserves a better overall production."
2,Not worth it,"After seeing all the New Doctor Who episodes, this one is a pale shadow of the series it seeks to imitate.Recycled plot lines, rushed action and multiple implausible scenarios.It adds nothing substantial."
3,Not great,"Although it had some decent Doctor Who wierdness, I couldn't get past the low-rent animation style. It looks like video game animation."
3,"Not the best, but watchable.","The animators for this took away from the episode more than they added to it, and the story did seem somewhat out of character, and The Doctor was portrayed more on quirks than actual substance. But as a collector of all Who knowledge, I'll give it 3 stars. Decent, but definitely could have been better."
5,Pure Doctor Who,"First, lots of people complain about the animation. It's done in the Cel-Shading or ""cell-shaded"" style that was popular a few years ago. Plenty of great video games and cartoons made use of it - Borderlands, Legend of Zelda - Skyward Sword, Ultimate Spiderman, just to name a few. If you want to see an example of what it looks like, google it and judge for yourself. If you can't get past that to actually enjoy the story, you have my sympathies. Because this is a great story. Very entertaining, well written and great acting. If you miss #10, and haven't seen this yet, go for it. It'll satisfy your David Tennant withdrawals.I will say this though - there were a number of times when the music was too loud and the dialog was too quiet, so it was hard to hear. That's my only complaint, and it didn't happen too often. I'd take off a quarter of a star for that, so not enough to worry about."
4,Interesting,"I'm not 100% sure how to describe this. It was, um, interesting. It was definitely kind of cool, with the usual doctor saves the world plot, but he seemed a little more vicious than usual, and it didn't seem as well-developed as episodes from the series. Of course, that could just be because it wasn't a part of the series, so it didn't have the development you can only get over a period of time."
2,It a Saturday morning cartoon,If your between the ages of 4 to 8 you might like this. It's no better than your average Saterday cartoon show. If you like that stuff I guess it's OK. Otherwise avoid it!
5,LOVE THIS FIXTURE!!!,"I picked out this light fixture when me and my ex were remodeling the house. I let him keep his house and bought myself a new one when I divorced him. but, I hand painted this fixture to make it look more weathered and It kills me that I can't have it. It is the perfect size; not too big, not too small and looks very expensive while not looking gauty. I guess I will break down and buy the same one for my new house since I cant find another one that I like as well. Unfortunately its at Lowes and I have a home depot credit card, so its going to cost me outta pocket cash in one lump sum and that sux. btw, lowes has this light for 159.00. It really is beautiful and perfect lighting."
5,One of the Best,Billye Brim is one of my favorite Christian women and she speaks and write a lot of very good spiritual insights.
5,Good Read,"Quick and easy to understand. Most importantly, the concepts are easy to apply to life. Great book to read for a bible study class."
4,very good,even though it was used it was in very good conditionI wouldrecommend to those who would like to get another copy to give brecause it is such a powerful book to encourage Christian's faith'
5,A Good Reminder,"The Blood and the Glory is a good reminder for Christians to invoke the power of the blood of Jesus over their lives, their families, their ministries and their churches. The old time Pentecostals knew this secret, but it has been lost to many over the years. Let's return to preaching and pleading the blood of Jesus!"
4,Powerful and revealing application of spiritual warfare,"Mightily Holy Spirit inspired, this book presents hands-on experience in the application of spiritual warfare by utiilizing the ultimate effective weapon (the blood of Jesus) where the rubber meets the road. The application of these techniques will provide the cutting edge for anyone in a serious life or death spiritual battle. This is what I call ""the hard stuff"" and is definitely not for those of little faith or the faint-hearted."
3,HMMMMMMMMMMMM,"I got this game thinking it would be the coolest, and it turned out to be alright, but not suberb. The game itself is fun, graphics(which I make a big deal out of) were like the beginning of ""3-D"", since it does have polygon graphics.. The ground is not detailed, just green with wierd dots on it. In space though, you have the choice to be in your cocpit or viewing the backside of the ship. Your buddies, Toad, Falcon, and Rabbit say the same things over and over again.Overall this game is pretty exciting, but you may wanna think it over."
3,Another classic.,"This is the first star fox game and its not like the others. It was fun back then but now its bad. The graphics r horrible even for the snes, the sound is messed up, it does not have a good story, its VERY HARD, and the controls r hard to use. Yes its the one of the first game on the snes but its not very good. Its still kind of fun to play when u have nothing else to do."
2,From Your Typical Mario Game Lover,"I didn't like this game very much. Although it was a pretty good game for the time period it was made, it still didn't impress me. Maybe it is because I perfer ANY Mario game over a lot of other games."
4,good summary in pictures,if you're looking for a lot of pictures of champions both good and bad then this is the book for you. the section naming the different kennels in the USA was very informative.
3,Yes... yes...,"I bought this CD in the hopes of it having a bunch of the great songs that were on the show, but I found out that they dont have very many, it has 21 tracks, and most of the songs were pretty good, but it wasnt exactly what I was looking for, but for the price, I personally think it was a good buy, because most of the songs are good on it, so I recomend it for whoever is a Wolf's Rain fan"
5,easy listening,"I really enjoy listening to this soundtrack, if you are a fan of the series there is no doubt that you will enjoy the music on this disc. There are a variety of songs on here, some in english and some in other languages, I only understand english but I still listen to the other tracks because of how well done they are. I watched the whole series back when it came out almost 2 years ago and I still listen to the music even today. Buy it or DL but definately get it."
4,Good economical fax for home or small office,"I use this in my home office. I don't send alot of faxes or make alot of copies so I didn't need anything fancy and didn't want anything overly technical or expensive. This fits my needs perfectly, beginning with its low cost ($59 new, after $10 rebate, from on-line merchant). It's small so doesn't hog desk space, easy to set up and use, has plenty of features (more than I'll ever need or use) and though the print quality isn't the best you'll ever see, it is easily legible and certainly satisfactory, for both faxing and copying. It may not be the machine for large offices or someone who sends alot of faxes or makes alot of copies, but, as an economical fax machine for occasional use in a home or small office, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this one."
2,Cheaply put together,"Very cheap plastic paper-feeder tray snapped in easily enough for me, but it never snapped back out, nor would it feed the paper used for fax confirmation in easily. The other feeding system for the actual faxes seemed to work just fine at first, but then I noticed the paper frayed noticeably on one side if you resent it several times--not a good flaw if you want to resend one page, like a resume, to multiple employers. One last drawback is the included ink cartridge that is meant only as a ""test cartridge"" for up to 30 pages of use. Then, for around $20, you are supposed to buy a replacement ink cartridge that will last for another 150 pages of use. Well, the price was nice, but the product was not. I bought this at Office Depot and to their credit, they gave me a full refund without any re-stocking or re-packing fees, quite unlike CompUSA's return policy. I feel sorry for the poor fellow who has to re-pack that thing, though. Good luck on getting that paper feeder back out."
4,Simple and easy,This is a very good basic fax/copier. It will handle most jobs for a small home office and it's easy to use. Just don't send a large (50 page) fax to it or you will use all your ink in one shot.
3,A Wandering Film,"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea has been adapted many times for television. Some of these film interpretations have been wonderful, and others are plain trash.Regarding THIS version (with Michael Caine, Patrick Dempsey, and Mia Sara), the greatest positive I was able to find is that the film does have some action packed moments and makes the veiwer feel sorry for Captain Nemo (and sympathize with his cause).However, the name of the film, a captain called Nemo, a ship-sinking submarine, a professor called Arronax, a harponer named Ned Land, and a lot of angry sentiment about the world above the ocean are basically the only things the novel and this film have in common.In short, if you want a more accurate telling of the novel, purchase the classic Disney version (starring Kirk Douglas & James Mason). However, if you do not mind being surprise with a different rising action and climax, than this 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea could be just the adaptation for you."
3,Michael Caine and Brian Brown wasted on a poor script,"If someone thinks he/she can write a better plot than Jules Verne, PLEASE put some thought into it and do not offend our intelligence with this kind of story. A young Arronax that is envied by his dad? C'mon, guys, this is not 'The Bold and the Beautiful'! . Michael Caine and Brian Brown just manage to redeem this flick. Surely scriptwriters can do better that this!!"
1,Who the hell is cable attucks?,"AHOY MATESINSULT YE INTELLIGENCE !THIS IS NOT YOUR FATHER'S 20,000 LEAGUES.THIS IS NOT EVEN JULES VERNE'S 20,000 LEAGUES?SEE IDEAS STOLEN FROM JULES VERNE TURNED INTO PYSHCO-BABBLE!At this time if I were to warn the uninitated, I could only compare it to a seemingly authentic imported cigar; innocent until the first puff when a strange stink is unleashed and if one continues to puff away will undoubtedly find that it blows up IN YOUR FACE leaving both tears of laughter and utter disbelief that youdid not recognise immediatley that it was a ruse to be for the best avoided."
2,The Mark of Caine,"Protracted and tedious, this American TV adaptation is short on imagination and long on (tiresome) screen minutage. The effects work is weak, as is the charmless script. The only saving graces are some nice production design, especially the Nautilus' interior, and another spirited performance by Michael Caine, who is always a class act. However, despite Caine's performance, this rates a poor second to the Ben Cross version, also available through Amazon. That isn't great either, but at least isn't so retina-scorchingly long."
2,Corny! And only vaguely represents the novel...,"A number of added and omitted characters from the novel. The squid scene is VERY weak, even the 1950's version has a significantly better and more fun squid scene. Michael Caine does well as a tough talking Capt. Nemo, but Patrick Dempsey just does not belong here. Also, the open sea scenes are very obviously stages with phony looking sky. This version of the movie is just very weird on so many levels. Definitely do not recommend. We liked the Disney version better, even though it is much older."
3,A Surprise!,"I did not know what to expect when I purchased this. It is surprisingly good. Caine doesn't look Indian, but still makes a plausible and somewhat menacing Nemo. I could have done without the romantic subplots and the abusive father, but all in all it is better than many of the other miniseries I've seen of classics...see Hallmark's ""Mysterious Island"" and ""Jason and the Argonauts."" Well worth the purchase if you don't spend a lot."
4,Very good,"I'm always nervous when bands come out with their next release after a really good album, because I'm afraid I'll be disappointed. I really liked ""Commit This to Memory"" so I felt like MCS had a lot to live up to.Turns out I had nothing to worry about; this is just as good. I've only listened to it twice so I'm not yet qualified to review it track-by-track but ""Hello Helicopter"" stands out. If you liked ""Commit This to Memory"", pick this one up."
2,Would have been great 2 years ago.,"Motion City comes back around with a disc that sounds very dated. Listening to the album gives you a nostalgic feeling at first but by you finish you realize that its time for you to move on, Power Punk is dead. Motion City isn't a bad group but the climate has changed. This is not 2005 when Motion City along FOB and HelloGoodbye were fresh. An overused sound has destroyed Motion City and all of its clones. However the album's singles are pretty good but its frustrating when their momentums gives way to a crop of terrible songs. In 2008 punk needs to become more relevant and less childish Even if it kills Them."
3,dead to me,"Written on autopilot. Completely redundant. Just a sedated version of the last album. Less melodic, less energetic, less tempo changes, less guitary, and nothing new added (unless you want to count the conventional piano ballad The Conversation). The second guitar on the verse of Can't Finish What You Started before the vocals kick in is the high point of the album and emphasizes what the rest is lacking."
1,Turned it Off After 4 Tracks,"I Am The Movie was gold, their following release after that was gold as well.I tried to listen to this CD twice but couldn't get through the whole thing. They have completely abandoned making fun and catchy songs and instead are making more music to fit into an already oversaturated genre (see garbage like: Cartel, Cute is What We Aim For).I really hope this band can rebound with another great release in a more mature direction next time around. I am definitely over this band.If you are 13-16, you may enjoy it."
3,solid but hard to live up to past albums' greatness,"As a huge mcs fan, i had big expectations for the 3rd album i bought. This newest album has some standout tracks and singles but is just not quite a steady-through hit machine like the other 2 previous albums. I would recommend those but as for this, it's hard to fall as in love with. Maybe subsequent listenings will bring out a new love for it. They changed their sound and may be in a different key this time around."
4,A blast from the past -- cool retro-rock!,"The British Invasion of the late '60s is back with the Coral, but it's not the Beatles and Stones. More like the Zombies and Animals. The debut Coral CD is chock-full of retro sounds like fuzzy psychadelic electric guitars and mind-bending organ solos. ""Dreaming Of You,"" the first single, is a brisk and happy three-minute wonder, complete with blissful harmonies and a bouncy rhythm section. ""Goodbye"" has an ultra-snazzy guitar intro, a stylish lead vocal from one of the Skelly's, and (topping it off) a runaway guitar solo that stirs up a bit of Doors-ish magic. The intro price for the CD also can't be beat. You oughta check it out!"
5,Look in the eyes...,maybe you'll see he's lying and is married. This is a true story of a girl who naviely falls in love with a married man. He lies and lies until she finally is getting stalk and scared out of her mind. Very good movie it is a must see. If they say they are not married don't believe them.
3,Overlooked lifetime flick,"I won't lie, this is a total lifetime movie. But it's a good one! It's about this cheerleader who is a senior in high school who meets this hot older man who is everything a girl wants: good looking, smart, rich, a respected lawyer, and he is totally crazy about her. Things heat up between them and she is totally happy, until someone starts following her and leaving threatening letters. It gets pretty intense and the person behind it is not who you'd think. If you like the ""lifetime movie"" genre, it's one of their best."
1,Rip-Off.....What A Joke,I've been looking and waiting for this movie to come out for years. So now it's out - but wait! It's not the whole movie! What a joke! They've cut out half the movie - some of the most important parts. Why? Save your money - don't buy this travesty. This is a joke. Potential Buyer Beware!
2,Freedom Road,The movie was cut in half. You cut important political parts out. You did not show where the deal was made to pull the union solders out of the south. And much more. I am very disapointed.
2,your freedom road is CUT,great except it is cut to pieces Original was 186 minutes it was a mini series!!!this what get when you don't check what you order.
3,"I loved the book and enjoyed the film, but the acting isn't very good.","In High School I had to read Howard Fast's novel ""Freedom Road"" and thought it was very good and had me reading it in one setting. I watched the ""mini-series"" when it came on, and while I enjoyed it I felt the acting wasn't very good and felt that Muhammad Ali wasn't quite ready to be an actor and wasn't the best choice to play in this. Other than the acting(I felt the whole cast wasn't into the movie like they should have been) that this was just fine."
5,Incredible Book,"A book that gets to the heart of what the church, what Christians should be. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is willing to be challenged in their walk with Christ."
1,Not For Laymen - HELP!,"In a recent training session for Agros International it was stated that this text was used as their philosophical base. Having great respect for the work of Agros and World Vision it seemed logical to read a copy and gain a deeper appreciation of their work. Sadly I am disappointed in what I found, not because of any disagreement with its content or motives of the author, but that it is far to intellectual to be understood by laymen (such as myself and co-workers). If one can't understand what the writer is saying, of what use is the book?Surely World Vision must have someone on their staff who can assemble this information in a book that can be readily comprehended by lay people. Currently World Vision president, Richard Stearns, has an excellent book in print, The Hole in Our Gospel, which is not only inspiring, but easy to read. I highly recommend this one."
4,I Can't Believe It's Not Really Motown,"I grew up in Michigan in the 60s, so I am very familiar with the heydays of real Motown music. I know how Smokey Robinson shaped the Motown sound with his songs, words and production...all of the finest quality. I saw the group perform these songs live at the Imperial Palace in Las Vegas. The whole place was standing and singing along. It was no surprise that these guy did an incredible job of delivering these hit in the true Motown Sound tradition. Smokey never put his name on anything that was not first class. This CD is a winner for all who want a faithful collection of Motown hits."
3,i like the sweet songs better,i dont care much from rap music but aaron does pretty well.i like the song jump jump though it has been stuck in my head.i think aaron has a good future. he should start writteing his oewn songs though.
1,a big joke,"who let this kid into the studio?????? he obviously realized he couldn't sing after hearing his first album!!! so then he tried rap which is even worse, cover your ears.... go back to school aaron!"
2,This is Sad Really,I really expected alot more from Aaron. I'm serious I mean with the kind of influence he's had in his family you would think he would have better songs. His new video is pretty good. The whole idea is based around one thing. If you look at the big artists now their videos are constantly changing and not always the same. I mean it looks like the brady bunch house is in his video. Really if you only like Aaron cause he's hot than don't buy the CD. If you like him for his music wait till its at a less expensive...
3,He's just a kid!,"Aaron Carter is very talented. If his last name sounds familar, It's because he's Nick Carter of the Backstreet Boys brother. I personally didn't care for this single.First, the song ""Aaron's Party (Come Get It)"" has no singing and can't be classified as rap. It's a little boy speaking to music. It has the snippits for 2 songs. ""I want Candy""(a remake) and ""Bounce"". ""Bounce"" is not destined to become a hit. The third song, ""Jump Jump"" is better than the title song and is not to be featured on Aaron's album. Buy it if you must, but I'm regretting it."
1,I so love this CD!!!!!,"if u like aaron carter do not read this review!i love that song Aarons party come get it! ha come get what..i hope he doesnt mean this cd. all it does is tell a story about him trying to get his parents out of the house so he can have some of his little girlfriends over...i think it should be banned from record stores. I dont care how old he is, he is a little spueaky boy. i saw his little performance on the Disney Christmas parade and it was terrible. to put it into a few words THE BOY CANT SINg and he should not be jumping around with women 3 times his age. the only reason why he has money is because little girls get sucked in by his nonsense music and bleachblonde hair. im sorry if ive hurt anybodys feelings."
5,One of the best I have seen!,This is a must buy for any girl out there! This is a good ex. of sister rivaly and love. It proves for a a young shy girl like Alice that dreams and hopes can come true! If you like Yuu Watase then you should pick this up and read it. It is a must read!
4,You can really relate to it!!!,"If you've ever felt outshined by an older/younger sibling, never having the courage to ask your crush out or simply too timid to ever fight back...? Alice 19th is a book for you! alice is a very timid girl and i found an attachment to her ecause of her personality. I know so many pple have this problem as well."
3,Not one of her best but still read-worthy,"Alice 19 is not exactly Ceres or Fushigi Yugi material. There are quite a bit of funny moments but the overall storyline is a bit generic, and somewhat recycled from Ceres. Other than those two complaints, the series does not fail to entertain. Alice grows as a character as does Mayura and Frei. Out of all the characters in this series, I like Frei the best. He put selfless concerns first before his own selfish desires, much like our Alice."
5,Alice 19th is a great book!,"I think this book is awesome! me and my friends have this group that we borrow each other's books and when I first found out about this book from online and I have bought every one that has come out (1-4) Alice is a very emotinal character and I can compare, I am very sensitive and I also have a sister that took away the one I love, but it turned out that he liked me. I highly recomend Alice 19th to everyone ^_^ happy reading"
5,Improvement,"I have had experience with Yuu Watase from watching the Fushigi Yugi anime series. I loved it, naturally, but found the relationship between Miaka and Tamahome unrealistic, forced, and dull. Too much ""Miaka!!"" ""Tamahome!!"" stuff.I was somewhat skeptical buying this, but I made an excellent choice. Alice, the main character, is actually likeable (unlike Miaka) and Kyo has a real personality, also. This was a welcome change from M + T. The supporting characters are great, of course, but they were also what kept FY going.Read this manga! It leaves at a cliffhanger, and I can't wait for the next one in December!"
5,Good,"I'll keep it short. It's about a girl who finds a rabbit who gives her (or, kind of helps her find) magical powers, and they rid people's heart with special words... Ok, the series is better than that. It's really good. One of the first manga series I've read, and I was hooked.Recommended for ages 16 and older. Contains some mild violence and language, plus nudity and attempted rape."
1,DANGER! UNDERRATED CABLE!,"Heated up to dangerous temperatures in just moments after plugging it into my TV. This wire is underrated, it is listed as 18AWG but it is not. The wire says 0.75mm^2 which is around 19AWG, while that doesn't sounds like a lot, that's a difference of about 3 amps (or 350 Watt) power handling difference, but my TV is new plasma model that doesn't draw anywhere near the limits of even 19AWG, so it wouldn't shock me if it was aluminum wire to boot. I would cut it open to find out what is really inside, but then I couldn't get my money back."
1,Extremely dangerous!,"Used this cable to hook up my plasma tv. It melted into 3 pieces and nearly destroyed my entertainment center. It was not kinked, pinched, or used improperly. It simply melted. The wire within is so thin that speaker wire would seem large compared to it. It is not capable of handling a tv!!"
1,Beware!,"Unfortunately, I had the same experience as the other 1-star reviewer. I purchased this item so my newly mounted TV could reach the outlet. As soon as I plugged it in, it began to smoke and got very hot. Thankfully, I was able to unplug it before it caught fire or destroyed my TV. When I inspected the cable, I noticed that it is 250V - although this should not cause smoking since it is plugged into a 110V outlet. In short, beware purchasing this cable since at least 2 of us have had dangerous situations result."
4,It works,"The length was as advertised and is functional. I have this attached to a flat-panel arm that folds, so it's reliability to bend and flex over time will certainly be tested. All indications point to this being a high-quality product."
5,Just what i was looking for,"I have a very shallow wall mount for my LCD TV. So shallow in fact that the plug that goes strait out the back pushed out too far. This is just what i needed. The chord coming out the side give me more than enough room cor the cabling. FYI the chord comes out the right if you are looking at it from the back, at least it does for me."
1,Not what's on the picture,"I was looking for a low-profile cord (like the one on the picture) for my wall mounted TV, but a completely different cord was delivered."
5,Good power cable,I use this cable to power my Sharp projector in my backyard movie theater. Both ends fit snug like they're supposed to and the cable itself feels solid. Cant complain.
3,Excellent if you like this sort of thing,"I am a gastroenterologist, that is, a physician who specializes in stomach and intestinal diseases. I bought this as a book for the waiting room. It is a well executed work. Photography is very high quality. Nicely bound. There are little sayings on each page that are not very noteworthy. For me it was the novelty that led me to purchase it, and my patients do find it amusing. There is nothing encyclopedic about it, so calling it a survey is overselling it. It is really just a sample of good photography where the outhouse is the main subject in each photograph."
4,I say its a must own for anyone who has a Super Nintendo System,"This is a pretty good game. The gameplay is quick, challenging, and not linear most of the time. The music sounds exellent for a SNES game (you'll know once you start playing), and the visuals look nice are are very...Jurassic Parkish. Get it if you own a Super SNES."
2,"run & shoot, run & shoot, run & shoot, run & shoot...","VERY REPETATIVE.. THE ONLY THING CHAOTIC IS THAT THIS GAME WAS MADE. 2 STARS IS GENEROUS. THERE ARE ENOUGH SNES GAMES OUT THERE, WHERE NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO RESORT TO THIS.."
4,Better than I thought,"Equity Indexing: The Insurance Industry's Secret Weapon Against Stock-Market RiskAt first, I thought this was going to be heavy on info. Then, it seemed more like ""chicken soup for the soul"". Stories were great, though. The concepts stick better when told through story. Overcoming diverse situations with a happy ending."
4,Learn from others how to live a successful 3rd stage of life.,"This is an uplifting book that shows how many different people in many different circumstances, have made a successful and fulfilled retirement for themselves. Not everyone in this book had a perfect beginning but they were able to make it work for them. This book reads easily and portrays various senarios that all lead to success for each person. A worthwhile read to help you plan and look forward to this wonderful time of life!"
3,Carly.............fascinating to watch,Just by watching her body language during the interview you can see how confident she is as a business person. Good lesson in public speaking and interviewing techniques as well.
3,Pretty good book for a reference,"This is a pretty good book if you use it for reference only. Its definitely not a tutorial or good at explaining the workings of agent. Pretty skimpy on the code examples. The exact content of this book is available for free on microsoft web site, I'm sorry I had to pay to find this out."
4,"Great ""live"" album and fun extra disk","Although this is technically a ""live"" record, the fact that it was recorded during radio broadcasts gives it a very polished studio feeling, blending the best of both worlds. It contains all the classic Aquavelvet hits (a good starting place for you first time Velvet-heads). The extra disk is a great addition too. It includes a very cool version of Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" You gotta here this surf version of the grunge classic to believe it. That song alone is worth the price of admission!"
2,Vanilla or wut?,"Ok. I guess all the surfers are stuck in this groove but after listenin' to the first side I was burnt out on basically---THE SAME SOUND! Vanilla or wut? Well, they do have their own sound but I'm giving 2 stars for disc 2 only. I only had to listen to four tunes on disk #2. Don't waste your money buy ""Nomad"" and you'll appreciate their concept better and it's all studio clean.Sorry guys, there's tons of other music better than this. But I bought into you because others rated you 5 stars. That's a pile of dung."
4,Little mystery/little romance,I enjoyed this second book of a trilogy. The mystery increased and a new romance started. Well done Nora Roberts. Now on to number 3.
4,Good Read,I am an avid Nora Roberts. Her trilogies are my favorites. This book is a good start. i am looking forward to reading the other two.
1,Older book not for fans of latest novels,"This book is long on introspection, short on dialogue, typical intimate scenes, virgin damsel in distress, hunk to the rescue etc... I will not buy the other two in the series because this one was REALLY boring. The back story, evil person after the stones, was not developed and it was just boring...zzzzzzz."
2,I,Love all of Roberts books and hope she writes another new one soon and I will have it as soon as it is out. PATTY SWANGO
3,Weak Plot,"As usual, Nora Roberts spins an attractive tale with interesting characters. The amnesia plot didn't bother me all that much but here's what did: if the heroine had time to send the other two stars by special courier, why didn't she just send them back to the Smithsonian instead of to her two best friends? (Well, because there wouldn't have been a book series, I guess, but besides that...)"
3,Hidden Star,"Not one of Nora's best but enjoyed it. It's the first of a trilogy. I'm not sure I'll read the other two books. In the case of most of her trilogies, I can't wait to get to the next one. Didn't feel that way with Hidden Star. I still love Nora Roberts books!!"
4,Great plot and characters,"I LOVE Nora Roberts. I read all her books and was suprised to find her in the ""Silhouette"" genre as I am not a fan of the short romance. I enjoy her mysterys but I was pleasantly surpised here. Although the book was great, I wish that instead of three short and sweet books, she had delievered a full fledged hardback encompassing the three friends. Overall, great book. I ordered the next two today!"
2,Predictable,This first book was ok but so predictable. I will still read the other two in the series with hope that they get better as their stories unfold.
3,Hidden Star,Good read but not a favorite. Not really understanding the situation or what direction the story was going contributed to the lower ranking.
4,Good Read,I love the dynamics of this book. The interaction between the couples and between the 3 females. I would recommend this book highly.
3,"Pretty good, but not great","This book was just OK. I read it with my niece and thought it was a bit too rebellious for the age group that will most likely read it. I completely understand that girls in the tween/early teen age will start to notice boys, but this book hypes it up more than it probably should. I think we will be sticking to more fantasy/adventure books instead, likeRebecca and the Strangest Garden on Earth. Better to be safe than sorry, I think. On a more positive note, it was a well written book with very interesting characters. If read by high school girls it might be more appropriate."
2,"A Very Quick, Dull Read","This book took only one day to read considering it was so short, however, there wasn't very much to it. The plot line basically consisted of boy likes girl, girl obsessed with boy, girl loses boy, girl gets boy back. That was it, there wasn't anything else to it, there was no complex plot, or character development. It was just a rich girl who fell for a guy whose life was skating and had a revelation not to listen to mommy and daddy ('rents) anymore and date him. It was utterly boring. Even though simple books can be refreshing sometimes, this book was overly simple. At the end, it left you with a sick feeling of I just wasted a couple hours of my precious time for that! I wouldn't suggest reading it and if your looking for a good sk8er story look for Love and Sk8, which was still a quick read, however, there was much more complexity and character development."
2,Utterly unbelievable,"I bought this book a few years ago and recently uncovered it in a box. I read it again and while the angst that Dawn feels is believable, the Starr character drives me bonkers. I had so many problems with her, least of all that Starr would NEVER be allowed to get pierced without ID. Tattoo/piercing shops should have paperwork to fill out PRIOR to piercing...it's a lot of CYA in those places. That part of the book is enough to make me want to stop reading.I agree with Miss Rose's review, the characters didn't have any time to develop the story was so short. The only characters I felt had any kind of development were the Ashley's which is strange. This plot line has been done so many times and in better books that this isn't worth the time. Grade: D"
5,Skater Boy by Mari Mancusi,If your in for a very fun read you will LOVE this story!!! Its fun and sad all rolled into one great story about how teenage life is with love! I love all of Mari Mancusi books!!! She is a excellent writer!! I would DEFINITELY recommend this to everyone no matter how old you are!! :)
3,"Good, but little substance.","Mari Mancusi's Sk8er Boy is a quick and entertaining read. But I felt the story line was lacking, and a little childish. The fact that the main character all of a sudden ups and leaves behind her life and friends and just starts hanging out with the new punk, emo girl, really is a silly move that could potentially ruin her in school forever but you get over it when the romance and drama kicks in.All in all, although I found this to be a good book, I think there is very little substance behind the story.I recommend this to chick-lit readers who having a soft spot for hot skaters."
4,Easy to use----a good value,"I am quite happy with my purchase of this product. The heart rate monitor is quite accurate despite the fact that there is no chest strap to wear. And let's face it, who really wants to wear one of those chest straps anyway?? Compared to other products on the market, this product is low to moderately priced, making it a very good value. I recommend this product for beginner to intermediate runners who are looking for a reliable product that is easy to use and that won't break the bank. Hope this helps =)."
2,"Well, it's a strapless heart rate monitor -",but you have to apply two fingers to sensors on the face of the watch to get the pulse.If you ride a bike or run with weights in your hands you'll be better off with some other product.
3,Good and bad,"I purchased this item for my husband who had a Casio pulse watch for many, many years and it recently died after he went diving in the Caymans. Casio no longer has any pulse monitors so the hunt began. This watch is handsome looking, a bit on the bulky side but fine for a man. The back of the watch must be in contact with your wrist in order for the monitor to work. That was different from the Casio so only the person wearing it can get their heart rate. But, one of the biggest reasons I bought this was due to a review that it was easy to program. That turned out not to be the case. Definitely not intuitive programming like the Casio. You will need the manual and you will need to keep referring to it when you have to use some other function or make a change to the settings. That was the biggest disappointment. Otherwise, it's a fine product."
1,New Balance HRT Watch,This watch looked good and fit great but after 3 weeks of use the band broke and it no longer monitors the HR and it is only 5 weeks old. Spend the extra money and buy a high quality HR watch.
4,IT'S FUN TO RUN A NATION 7 OUT OF 10,"Utopia succeeds at what it's supposed to do, let you build a nation on a distant planet and run it. I was surprised that I actually had genuine fun with it. The game also goes into detail like how many deaths or births were in the colony for that month, how many people work at different jobs, you can raise taxes, and build many buildings, spacecrafts, mines, and more. It does feel a bit repetive at times and it was a difficult game(the longest I held a nation on the game was 5 years before my colonists left me). If you like the Sims you'll have fun with this game."
1,"Scary, Out-of-Date, and more than a little Prejudicial...","Saying you're impartial and actually acting (and writing) impartially are two different things, and the latter is much more difficult -- and noble -- than the former. Unfortunately, this out-of-date tome promises to be a balanced look at the liberal media bias, and then proceeds to take potshots at anybody who has ever voted for a Democrat, and excuse or celebrate anybody who has ever voted for a Republican. I suppose a tribe of apolitical reporters who have given up their power to vote would be preferable to the author, or better yet, inhuman proxies who'd just pull the Republican right-wing lever each and every time. The writing is dry and boring, and there is plenty of old-fashioned euphemistic code, giving one the distinct feeling that Mr. Bozell won't be caught having a conversation over lunch with a gay Jewish Democrat anytime soon. It left a bad taste in my mouth."
1,Threw it out. Don't bother.,"I've never just up and threw out a book before - this is garbage - I think I wrote better stuff in grammar school - very poor vocabulary, eight grade level at best. Syntax like a children's book, but not even that good really. Sorry, Lauren - I'm heartened, however. Now I think I may actually get a book published!!"
1,with all due respect...,"the only reason that i read this sequel was because i committed to reviewing the first book and this book. enough is enough. the whole ""fake pregnancy"" of Jane's was sooo....um...dumb? and, wow (!!!), Jane finds an abandoned baby on the steps of a church. *rolls eyes* it can't get more contrived than that. :/this author has enthusiasm, which i think is great - but she's not a chick lit author that writes books that i enjoy. and it has nothing to do with ""values"" - the story was just so contrived and i just wanted to throw a brick at Jane...dumb girl.anyway, kudos to those of you that enjoyed it."
1,not sufficiently focused on USA car culture,"I was expecting this to be a collection of articles about the American experience of the automobile: how the industry grew, specific cars that made an impact on the culture, specific people who contributed to the advancement of technology, and well written articles by people who grew up loving cars. Unfortunately, almost none of the articles fit the bill. Many articles deal with South American and European drivers, cars, and history. There are few articles that deal with American car culture. I ended up not reading most of the articles till the end (they were all less than 20 pages long) simply because I had lost interest. The best things about this book are the title and the preface, both written by the editor, who should have written the entire book herself."
3,mini binds,"These mini blinds were a great find and an unbelievable price!! After searching everywhere for a 47 inch blind for my kitchen I find these blinds for under $20.00!! Blinds this size usually cost about $80.00 and up for one window. However, it was plastic and not aluminum but still it was a fantastic finde."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I ordered 4 white 29x64 blinds and I am careful with venetian blinds of this quality but to no avail. Two of the blinds snapped at the top while letting the blinds go down for the night. I had to re-order both of them. The second replacement has a wand that is very hard to turn to allow light in or out. Therefore, I must unfortunately have to say that these blinds were made very cheaply, and you must be very gentle with them or they will break, and you may get a blind that is totally defective. I have to recommend to everyone that you should pay a little more for a better product. Venetian blinds should not break even when you are gentle with them. I can't recommend this product. Look for something else. Two blinds breaking and one wand hard to turn is quite un-acceptable."
4,Work as advertised,"I've bought these multiple times on Amazon. They are as advertised and of decent quality. They do have a bit of an odor to them for a few weeks, so be aware of that."
4,mini blinds 58x64,The blinds arrived quickly and fit perfectly. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the vanes don't close completely so people can partially see you moving inside. This is not a problem where I have it but I wouldn't put them in the bedroom.
5,exactly as expected,blinds were exactly what I wanted and expected from the picture and description.shipping was on time and in excellent condition.
2,Vinyl 1 Inch Mini Blinds- White 21x64,"First of all, they were only 20 inches wide, not 21 and they were very cheaply made.If you can find the size of your blinds somewhere else, don't buy these."
4,Brilliant,"I have not yet finished this book, which is why I can't give it 5 stars. But it is brilliantly written with a strong thesis which is supported throughout. The way it ties the history of the arts and societal differences into the educating of artists and arts education is incredibly clever. I'm currently going to school for art, history and education and this book ties them altogether in a way that makes learning the information incredibly interesting and useful. Arthur Efland is my new hero."
4,textbooks,"this book is in really good condition, its pretty much brand new. bought it for a college course and the price wad very reasonable."
5,"Honest, and Straightforward","I am an aide in an Illinois school, and I was appalled when I first started by how DUMBED-DOWN things are! Fourth graders are doing single digit addition and subtraction! I read this book and realized that my children are not going through such agony and boredom as the other unfortunate children in the public schools. This book gives reasons for shortcomings of the public school system, and makes for entertaining and enlightening reading. It is not a 'guide,' but it is certainly worth reading."
2,Good information but argumentative and has attitude problems,"Unlike the subtitle suggests, this isn't much of a guide for parents to help them teach children, but rather a discussion about the concept of homeschooling and arguments for homeschooling.I found that the book tended to ignore the value of children's emotional growth (rather than academic/intellectual growth), is US-centric, anti-sexuality education, pro-conservative religious education, and resorts to emotional arguments to support homeschooling.Despite these attitude problems, the foundation of the book is good; it gives good reasons and supporting argument for homeschooling, encourages parents to do so, and supports the idea that all parents can homeschool if they choose to; you don't need to be a qualified teacher, you merely need to have the love and respect for your child to do what is best.215 pages, no illustrations."
2,There are So Many Better Choices,"This book is more of a rant than a helpful resource. Blumenfeld seems to think the schools are out to kidnap our children. Granted, they are pretty awful, and homeschooling makes good sense, whether you are a Christian or just a parent interested in a decent education for your child (or both!) But there are so many better books on this subject, and if one wants a really good rant, read John Taylor Gatto's ""Dumbing Us Down""."
1,Don't bother with this book,"I don't know why the word ""Guide"" is in the title of this book. The whole thing reads out as the author's personal opinions and ramblings. He appears to be ultra conservative and sometimes down right backwards in his views. Not helpful in the least!"
2,Very slanted toward Christianity,"I was surprised that a book with the name ""guide"" was based so heavily on this author's personal religious convictions and idealogies. Couldn't get through it."
2,This book falls _way_ short of its promises.,"Although the initial discussion of spinoffs was ok, the 90 or so ""case histories"" are useless. Each one is about a paragraph in length, and merely describes the terms of the spinoff, with _no_ commentary whatsoever. The book will give you an idea of which types of spinoffs are worth further investigation, but it does not teach you how to analyze these situations further. However, there is a shameless advertisement for the author's spinoff newsletter at the end of the book. Tsk, tsk...If you're interested in this type of investing, I would highly recommend Joel Greenblatt's ""You Can Be a Stock Market Genius"", which manages to go into further depth in about 10% of the space - and at half the price!"
1,This came without a lock ring which means you can't install it,"I got this sram pg970 cassette, but it came without a lock ring. That's the piece you need to tighten to keep the cassette in place."
3,Wore out way faster than OEM,"When I first used this to replace my original cassette, it worked nice, great even. Shifted really nice, good overall performance.Now here we are today, a little over a year since I bought it. The thing is skipping/just not grabbing the chain. The teeth, while looking mostly OK, just aren't cutting it. This is maybe 800-900 miles in, 700+ of which are simple pedaling around campus. Whatever came with the bike lasted easily 2-3X as long, and with just the same amount of use/abuse.So, at least for me, this does not meet my expectations of durability. It rides well and performs great for everything I used it for, up until not, which included campus/general commuting, plus a full ride of the Kokpelli trail.Overall, I would recommend this, performance wise, and you really can't beat ~$30 for a cassette, but just don't kid yourself that it will last all that long."
3,Great cassette,"Time will tell if how well it performs but over last several hundred miles it has been excellent. Here's the thing many people don't realize: You have to replace the chain with the cassette at the same time (assuming the chain is equally worn). Otherwise you can expect a lot of chain popping. Likewise, you can't put a new chain on an old cassette. I rode my original cassette for about 2000 miles and would have kept riding it except the chain had broken too many times and could not be shortened any more.Update - after about 600 miles the pin that holds the cogs together sheared. The cassette still functions but if I remove it the cogs and spacers come apart and it's a pain to put back together."
2,Piece,"Skipped from day one on speeds 4,5,6,and 7. Yeah, I bought a new chain (KMC 9 speed) at the same time, so I know the chain is not the problem. My advice: save up and shell out the extra $40 or $50 for a semi- quality cassette.Before I knew the skipping was so bad, I was climbing up a trail (alone) when the chain skipped and my foot flew off--I almost broke my ankle--not fun =("
5,Best martini on the rocks glass ever!,"Simply put this glass does an excellent job of keeping iced liquid chilled. My preferred drink is a martini on the rocks. The drink remains chilled for a more than ample amount of time. This allows me to cut down on the amount of ice, thereby improving on the taste. Also I can enjoy my beverage at a more lesiurely pace."
1,Beautiful look - until they broke after only 1 week!,"We had received these glasses as part of the set with the French Press. We loved how beautiful they were and that we did not need to use a coaster at all. We used them for coffee and iced drinks, which they worked and looked great. Then after one week, one of them just cracked while it was sitting on our table. The liquid leaked in the section with air. We were very careful with these glasses and hand washed them gently. The other one is still ok, but now we just have one. I don't know if it was a fluke or not but for the price we were disappointed with the quality. We were planning on buying more as presents because the the style and usability but now we most likely won't."
2,"Two damaged, third one okay......for now","My daughter bought me the tea kettle for a gift (I have a red themed kitchen).It arrived - minus the paint on a quarter size part of the spout. I e-mailed customer service and was sent another one.The second kettle arrived - minus the paint and finish on about a half dollar size part of the spout, and also with the spout dented significantly.The third kettle has now arrived. It is in perfect condition! However, given the problems with the other kettles I am a little afraid to use it - I don't know how much wear and tear it can stand!(On a positive note: the customer service person was wonderful, even wrapping the third kettle herself.)"
3,history,it was really good for what I downloaded it for. Which was to learn more in history on Plato. He as a person always interested me. This book gives some insight into the mind I wanted to look at.
2,Treads Don't Stay Stuck,"These treads are super cute and easy to apply, but unfortunately they just don't stay stuck (I have an old enameled clawfoot bathtub, so I am only speaking to this surface). I put them on end of May and now it's end of June and half are gone with a few more half off already. They would probably be great for kids, but don't hold up to the weight and shuffle of adults. Too bad."
5,Very good...,"When I first saw this book, my thought was, ""A fictionalized version of ""Legacy of Luna."" I put it back on the shelf. Later, I found myself drawn back to it. I'm so glad I read it. It reminded me, style wise, of Ann Hood's ""Somewhere Off the Coast of Maine."" (Hood endorsed the book; perhaps Matson is a protege.) It is a very nicely written examination of extremists in the environmental movement, told through a protagonist who is new to the politics. It is a light read, and yet has substance to it. I think a lot of people will enjoy this."
2,defective player,"When this was first tried, the CD player lid would not close. Therefore the only way to play the CD was to continually hold down the lid. It was sent back. Low stars for defectiveness."
3,Top Load Boombox,The only thing I do not like about this boombox is the hissing sound the CD makes as it spins around. This was for my daughter and she said she cannot even hear the hissing sound. I question how long it will last-only time will tell!!
5,There is life after the death of a spouse.,"Through the effective use of a she said/he said format, Lintermans and Stolzman provide anecdotal evidence that there is life after the death of a spouse or life partner. They investigate the connection and rebirth of twelve couples, each of whom had gone through the loss of a spouse or life partner, and show how each person found their way back to life and healing through the power of new love."
5,Has a way of filling each song with strong emotions.,"Interesting mix of songs I have found so filled with strength, Spirit and Power. Messages from all angles on many fronts.His voice has the flavor of Bob Dylan, but with his own flair. He sings with his heart, his emotions, not just words turned into song as many do. Here you find a true gifted singer because he uses his heart, not his head. LIFE springs from the heart and you will understand what I say when you ""FEEL"" his songs."
5,"""Broadcast to the Addicted"" = very addictive song!","This CD is great, one of the better debut albums I've heard recently- ""Broadcast to the Addicted"" is an amazing song, and really sticks in your head. They have a very unique ""Fleetwood Mac meets Indie-Pop"" kind of sound."
1,The bad description!!!!,"I purchased this game for my son,because he love Yoshi so I thought this would be the perfect game for him. When I read the description of the game it said no where that it required the gun to play the game. So I bought my son a game that he can not play. He was so excited knowing he was getting a new game in the mail, only to find out to my dismay that he could not play it. So I had a very upset four yr old lil boy. I thought that was really bad that the seller did not include this very important information as to what was needed to play this game. I would send this game back if I knew how and that I could. It is serving no purpose so I will never buy from that seller again."
4,The next best thing to being there,"Let's be honest. In a field saturated by talented writers, there is no substitute for having some help from inside the industry. However, for any persistent writer or illustrator who has the talent, but no ""in,"" there is no substitute for this listing, which gives one hope for publication without candy coating the difficult task of breaking into this field.The listings are easy to use, and writer/illustrator-oriented, really bending over backwards to provide enough details about each potential publication company to prevent wasted effort. If you have an agent, or the means to get your manuscript or portfolio looked at by someone who matters, use that. But if not, use this book to maximize your effort and chances."
3,"Five stars for the music, 1 star for the dvd quality","If you're a fan of Mamady, or of African drumming, this is a must-have cd. Mamady and his group Sewa Kan are fantastic in this performace. You will rarely hear a musical group as tight as they are! Unfortunately, the dvd is marred by very poor production values. There are several instances where the sound is muddy, and the overall quality seems amateurish, as if this is something that was hastily thrown together. Hopefully, there will someday be a video of a Mamady/Sewa Kan performance that is of as high a quality as the musicianship."
2,In different container/no label,"This was sent in a clear plastic jar with no instructions as to how much salt to put in the tub. They only mentioned the size of the container which was 10"" x 8"" x 6"" and the jar was much smaller in size then what the discription was. I called the manufacturer and they stated that the plastic jar contained the same amount as the plastic jug with label (pictured). Something is not feeling right here."
3,was not what i thought,"I did not like the wrinkled pages as others have stated.I also did not like the inside margins with no room to write in. The bible does not stay open like I thought it should being a smyth sewn binding.I did however like the calfskin cover, the best I have seen.I also liked the format,paper,and font in this bible.Overall it is an o k bible, but i sent mine back,because for the money it cost you should love that bible.I did not. I sent mine back for a refund."
4,Recommend with slight hesitation,"This is certainly a beautiful Bible. The calf skin feels just like a Bible should feel (it is no Highland Goatskin Allan, but nice nonetheless). I have no qualms about the margins, although it is not as wide as a Cambridge Wide Margin. It has adequate space for sermon outlines and notes. The biggest issue I have with this Bible, and the reason I can't give it 5 Stars, is because of a common complaint. The pages wrinkle far to much for a Bible at this price point. It's especially bad along the center of the page. It makes the Bible look already pre-beaten up before you've done anything to it. If you can overlook these things then you will be more than pleasantly surprised by this Bible. Especially the cover."
4,In Touch Bible great quality but...,"The In Touch Ministries Wide Margin NASB Bible in Cowhide is a beautifully bound quality product. The feel of the cowhide exhudes quality, as does the paper and is one of the best 'quality feel' Bibles I have purchased. My only disappointment is the wide margin aspect. The advetising states that there is a 1"" margin around the text, however, after binding, this is not the case. It is very difficult to make notes next to the text at the binding as it is really not wide enough. It should have been wide like the margin at the edges of the page and at the top and bottom where there is ample room. I believe, therefore that people should consider purchasing the NASB updated wide margin, single column text reference Bible instead if they are prolific note takers."
4,something there but what not LOA,I was real excited to here this upon listening I realized this would not measure up to my expectations but there was moment I thought a couple some may have been started with LOA and felt close but not the same effect at all.This cd is very good but not the momenteum I hoped for the second one is better but I think the reformed LOA was needed and definetly heavier but you may like this more than I.I'm curious but not impress or a big fan sorry Joey much respect!
4,Awesome Follow Up,"This is a great 2nd cd. The only disappointment is, there hasn't been one since. My personal favorite is ""Drop Down"". The cd is heavier than the first, and easily as good. I won't say that every song is a winner, but neither was every song on the ""Perfect Self"" cd. ""Show Me"", ""Fallen"" and even ""Coming Home"" are great tunes. I like the lyrics on ""Coming Home"" and maybe that's why there hasn't been a 3rd cd.A lot of crap came out in 2003 and I would say, this cd was one of the better metal (or whatever you've labelled it) cd's of this year."
4,A decent follow-up,"Every time I listen to these guys, they remind me more and more to Sevendust. Their style and the lead singer voice is similar to Sevendust. If you like Sevendust, there's a great chance you'll like a lot these guys. I prefer their first album to this one,but that's my opinion. You'll just have to listen to it to draw your own conclusions. A good second album."
2,Disappointing,"Stereomud had a great debut album, Perfect Self. This is not a good follow up, not even close. Seems like they have been focusing on getting the guitar riffs messy and try to make it sound cool. It doesn't sound cool at all."
2,Stuck in the mud,"Second album for Stereomud finds the band recording the same music they have been making since 2001. Nothing new is presented, and although it is a tolerable listen, it's utterly forgettable.Wow, that was a fast review!"
2,The Dreaded Slump,"Stereomud regress on their second album, carefully recycling their bottom heavy groove, but without the cool songs that propelled their first record. There are very few if any memorable moments on this record, that seems as if it was made in a can. Bits of modern programming have been added to spice up otherwise mediocre cuts like ""Show Me"" and ""Breathing,"" but really are still pointless. ""Fallen"" and ""Yesterday"" sound like their last album, with powerful singer Erik Rogers stretching his voice out. For the rest of these generic songs, however, Rogers and his bandmates are doing nothing but retreading their (and everyone else's)steps."
2,Nobody needs this,"When I listen to this album, it makes me think of Hed P.E.'s Blackout (and that's not a good thing). Not that they sound the same, but they both make me wonder if bands actually listen to their music before they release an album.Ok, Stereomud isn't as bad as Hed P.E. At least Stereomud's singer sings and doesn't rap, and that's something you hardly see (hear) these days. As for the songs themselves, they don't really stand out from anything already released. The best song is Anything but Jesus, the first single. I think it's sad when an album's best song is the first single because it seems the album is filled with.. well.. fillers..Even if you like some of these songs, there's no reason really to pick up Every Given Moment (good title and cover by the way). There is so much better out there, you just need to look a little."
3,Not as good as Perfect Self,"The only other StereoMud CD I've listened to was ""Perfect Self"", and I bought this based on my appreciation for that CD. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad release, but it just doesn't have the hooks to grip you like PS, which I would rate as a 4+ stars."
4,"Barato, poderoso, pero un poco hissy","Gran pre, las guitarras de 10 dolares suenan como guitarras de 100 dolares, las voces alcanzan niveles dinamicos hasta de +6dbu.Lo recomiendo ampliamente, el unico y gran problema de el, es el hiss que se presenta dado a que no tiene un compresor integrado.Pero excelente para estudios de proyecto y caseros."
5,Awesome book!,"A compelling and wrenchingly honest first-hand account of slavery, manytimes breaking my heart and making me think of the children of Africatoday. A new book, ""The Last Witness From a Dirt Road"" which takesplace in 1946, was given to me after commenting about Solomon Northup'snarrative, and it could almost be a sequel to Twelve Years a Slave,written a 100 years later by the son of an overseer on a plantationalong the banks of Bayou Bouef in the same location in Louisiana. Oldsocial and economic orders seemed little changed from 1841 to 1946,tragic, heart rendering but both books are riveting and honest, aretimely and universal."
5,History,"I am using this book in my research book for my Masters Class. If you really want to know history, it is wise to invest!"
4,great condition,"This book aRRIVED FIRST out of a large order so servicde is promt and it is in great shape the only down side was it has ""Used"" stamped all over the sides and I prefer no markings on my text but still in great shape and what an amazing book!!! almost finished reading it and its gut wrenching to think what this man amoung many others had to go through!"
5,Outstanding Narrative from the View of a Free Man,this book or any biography from a former slave is a MUST read. Only a racist or compltete idiot would think ANY slave or prisoner be it now or then is happy in any stretch of the word.
3,Slave Narrative,"Not the typical slave narrative. This book was assigned for a class. I expected it to be much like the autobiography of Frederick Douglass, but Solomon Nortrup's experiences were much different. He was born free, and then kidnapped into slavery. This twist on the typical plot gives the reader new insights on slave/master relations, particularly since Northrup had previously experienced freedom and was educated at the time of his enslavement."
3,Good . . .but not great,"I purchased this book mainly due to an interest in classical society, and Robert Fagles' blurb on the front. There is a lot of interseting information here and it is wortha read if you are interested in the subject. However as others have pointed out, much of the information is repeated over and over. Additionally the line between hard history, informed opinion, mythological interpretation and plain speculation is very blurred in the writing. I have no problem wiht thoose things coexisting in the same work, however it should be clearly evident what is being discussed, and authors should refrain from using their own speculation to support a conclusion."
1,Awful writing. Really awful editing,"I found this book repetitive to the point that it appeared written by a high school student. If there was an editor, I can only guess what they were doing when they should have been editing this awful prose."
5,Ground-Breaking and Provocative,"The ancient Greeks and Romans were not just wise but toxic; they were as much at home with venom as with virtue; and their heroes fought with germs as well as arms. Thse are the conclusions of this ground-breaking new book. Fascinating and provocative, Greek Fire will make you rethink the legacy of the ancient world."
2,"Save your money, don't buy this one!","This is one of the biggest wastes of money I have been suckered into for a long time. Save your money and do some research on the internet, instead. This production is a joke! A couple of good tips on where to find gold in rivers, but that's all. Like I said, internet research is preferable to this DVD!"
4,Half excellent - other half good.,"I buy tons of lounge/chill/house CD's. Too many lack complexity, meaningful lyrics, or sufficiently professional arrangement. Too many feature flat, meaningless, or amateurish electronica. But Kinkysweet is fairly consistent with producing compilations of well-executed tracks that are musically and otherwise sophisticated.I have listened to this dual-disc complilation about two dozen times front to back. I think that disc one is really fantastic. Disc two hasn't really caught on with me as much, but not due to any specific flaws that I would want to point out. It's just that disc one really strikes a chord with me.Anyway, this one is in the top 10% of all of this kind of music that's being put out right now. I recommend it."
4,Interesting twist,"I read the book after seeing the film.I liked them both a lot,but the film has a somewhat different ending, which I especially liked. This is the only Isaac Bashevis Singer book I've read, and the film did it justice, except I have a feeling the ending might offend his literary fans. It could be said that it wrapped up the story in a way quite uncharacteristic of the author. My guess only."
2,I should've paid more attention to the reviews...,... but they weren't as clear as I'll make this. This is in NO way a book that teachers use as a reproducible to send homework home with their students. This is an at-home reference for kids to use in case they are doing their homework and need to look up information about a part of American History. It is good for differentiation in the classroom - for providing a different reading level on certain topics.
2,It's not worth more than $2,"I recently bought a super nintendo, and it came with Donkey Kong Country, Mortal Kombat 2, and Yoshi's Cookies. I am a huge fan of anything DK, and I love Mortal Kombat, I figured the Yoshi game would also be pretty good too because it has Yoshi in it. All Yoshi's cookies is, is Yoshi throws cookies and you have to line up I believe 5 of the same cookies to make the dissapear, once all the cookies are gone from a level you advance and it gets harder. I foudn it fun for the first 10 minutes, but after that it became so boring, and I haven't played it since. I recommend not buying this game, unless you have a young child or a little kid."
4,"Starts with basics, then covers many variations.","A good book on knotwork. Starts out with very basic, step-by-step instructions, but then covers lots of more advanced designs and variations. Many sample designs are shown. (Book claims 434 illustrations). It is all black and white except the cover."
4,If you're only buying one,"If you're only buying one of Meehan's books, get this one. It's earned its cost 100 times over in helping me design my own knotwork patterns. The history is interesting on the first read; I'm not working on (nearly) priceless vellum so I can afford rough drafts on scrap paper and don't follow the formal construction methods. But there's plenty of material to serve as a starting point.The collection of Trinity knots in the back is fabulous--try them in balloon art for a change of scale."
3,I expected more,"My review for this book is the same as for the Beginner's Manual from the same author. I guess I expected more instruction. There are fabulous examples of historical knotwork, but very little instruction on how to create your own. I suppose copying is the way to teach yourself this style of art."
3,quality control,The pump for the product doesn't work so you have to unscrew the top and remove it each time you shampoo! Why not contact Amazon for a replacement pump? Because it is virtually impossible to contact Amazon to resolve a situation - this is disappointing because I am a big believer in Amazon and order quite a bit through their marketplace!
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"One of the top ingredients in this shampoo is Sodium Laureth Sulfate. This is really disappointing, as I expected a higher-end shampoo touting natural ingredients to perhaps forgo or lessen the amount. As a result, it's very abrasive and drying to my hair, essentially the same effect as using the bargain brand's clarifying shampoo. Definitely not worth the money."
4,Cleanest Hair Ever,"After use, my hair was softer, more manageable, and residue-free. I use it with the B&B Seaweed conditioner."
2,good for tape copy,"I just want to have a recorder to copy the music teacher's assignment. And, this recorder does the job fine. The rewind button quit jump up on the first day I get this thing. I still keep it because I need one to do copy and I am too lazy to return it."
5,Portable Boombox,"I rally enjoy this boombox. I have had two others and listen to classical music from two tapes when I go to bed at night. The other two no longer work and I cannot offord the boomboxes that have the CD players so this boombox I purchased from you just fit the bill and my budget. I am disabled so my budget is tight and I could afford this but I noticed the price of the one I received was slightly higher than the first one I ordered. That is OK, though because it was worth the small price hike."
5,excellent piece of reference material,"this book and the companion volume 1906 -1922 which covers the first world war and has many of the ships that fought in the world war 2,are an absolute value to any one studying the navies of the world during the second world war. the class by class data in the order that the ships were built, as well as the complete lits of names per class.are invalubel to any one attempting to locate a ship name. I recommend these books to both historian as well as modeler or enthuist alike."
3,"feels good, smells awful","This product is good for cleansing skin if you have psoriasis in that it doesn't dry your skin out or burn, but it doesn't smell like either lavender or bergamot (both scents I love) -- smells a lot like old newspapers. I recommend the lemon verbena and grapefruit ""flavor"" instead -- it smells wonderful."
4,Petuch's New Caribbean Fauna,"Love him or hate him you just cannot ignore him. Controversial and and yet cutting-edge, Dr. Edward J. Petuch is a force in modern malacology which sooner or later everyone interested in mollusks must deal with. Having described more than 1,000 species of fossil and living mollusks Petuch has shaken the world of modern malacology. This book is a must for any malacological library. Whether you agree or disagree with the author you must have this book in order to make an honest determination. Filled with original species descriptions and photos of these or other little known species, this book is a valuable resource."
4,Great for the imagination,"My 3 year old son adores this helecopter. It is extremely durable (having been ""flown"" across the rooms many times only to crash land into the wall / wooden floor / sister's head) and whilst a few pieces come off on impact, nothing has broken, and the small pieces easily reassemble. In fact, in the end we left off those smaller pieces (such as the search light and fire extinguisher) and it has not had an impact on the functionality or durability of the toy.This helecopter is smaller than some of the other playmobil helecopters, so it is a great toy also for travelling.The best thing about this is the development of imagination - my son has gone from flying his helecopter,to rescuing people from burning coffee tables, to flying through the rain (sprinler system) to give a weather report to the radio station. I love the way one simple, durable toy can spark off such imaginative thoughts inside my 3 years old head.Highly recommend for children who love transport toys."
1,Magic? More Like A Curse!,"I have read several other of the author's books and enjoyed them. To say this book was disappointing is putting it mildly. The hero repeatedly rapes his wife...these scenes are very distressing to read. Even when he decides to treat his wife with 'kindness' in bed, he still continually humiliates her -privately and in public. His cruelness is boundless. There is an unsatisfying mystery thrown in half-way through the book. Try another of Ms. Coulter's books and bypass this one."
1,How is rape romantic?,"This was my first Catherine Coulter book. I bought her book because she is listed as a best-selling romantic novelist, but it seems to me that she's a bit warped. How is rape romantic? And why are people so obsessed with her books? Rape seems to be a running theme...I won't be buying any more of her ""romance"" novels...This was a reissue so Ms. Coulter DID have the opportunity to delete the rape scenes but chose to leave them in...?????"
1,When reviewing my past orders.,"When reviewing my past orders I find that I did not receive this order.Midsummer Magic (Magic Trilogy)Moonspun Magic (Magic Trilogy)Calypso Magic (Magic Trilogy). I did not find an area where I could notify Amazom, or where I could inquire about possible actions."
2,It was enjoyable,The story was nice. I didn't like the rape in it so that's why I gave it a low rating. Love won out in the end. The story line was interesting and it kept by interest but Catherine Coulter has written far better stories. I will continue to read her books because they are entertaining.
3,STORY LINE GOOD,The story line was good. It slowed down in the middle. Picked up towards the end. I found the type-o's were very distracting. I have never read a novel with so many errors in grammar or sentence structure. I hope the next one will be easier to read.
2,I liked the simple format but it is so bias,"I bought the book to try and understand the Fed. Unfortunely the author spends so much time trying to convince you the system needs to be changed, that a lot of the workings of the Fed are simply not covered. Very incomplete."
5,Masterpiece,"Probably the best Final Fantasy game ever made. This game was so revolutionary in its time. Everything about this game gets five stars, storyline, music, character development, replay value. I still play this game from time to time. It's truly a classic"
5,Words cannot adequately describe....,"This review has been long overdue. Years in fact. But I had to praise what I consider to possibly be the greatest RPG of all time. (Yes, IMHO). In fact, this game is what got me hooked on role playing games. I'll keep this short and to the point. The storyline is so deep, so involved, so moving, it captured me from the start. I felt this odd compelling connection to the characters. The music is also enthralling. Celes theme is so beautiful and conveys such emotion, it literally moves me to tears. The battle music, and Terra's theme is great as well. In short, this game is a classic and truly a masterpiece."
2,Disapointed by a few aspects,"Although I was initially excited to read this book, I found myself disapointed. There is some helpful information on building intimacy,however;I was disheartened to come across her chapter on being a mother or lover where she discusses how she learned not to be ""child-centered"" by keeping her children out of her bed and letting her babies cry it out along with quotes by Gary Ezzo(He is known to be very controversial). She came across as her way was the only right way to raise children and to have a Godly marriage and I wholeheartedly disagree with her. As a mother of 4 myself, my husband and I have taken a different road and still maintain a Godly marriage. I know many many others who have done the same. I would have liked to have seen her display the different options, pros and cons and left the parenting styles up to the individual couples...The good information on sexuality I have found in other sources such as Intimate Issues by Dillow and Pintus."
5,A Biography like no other,"In all my years of reading, there has not been many times that a book has compelled me to write a review. This is one that has touched me in a way that no other biography has done. I thoroughly enjoyed Nobody's Son! It isn't like any other biography that I have read, because it reads just like a novel. As I read, it was as though Mr. Keeling was right in my living room telling me his life stories. I could see in my mind's eye everything that was happening. Mr. Keeling writes in a beautiful descriptive voice. These were real stories, about a real person, with real struggles. I found myself saddened to the point of tears as he describes his first years of his life and elated over his success. This man is a survivor in the true sense. I highly recommend this book. There is no doubt that you will enjoy Nobody's Son too."
1,Might as well add water to your brow! COMPLETELY runny!,"I am so disappointed in this product. I've scrapped and wiped the ""mascara-type"" brush off before applying and it is still like applying water or baby oil to your brow. Make sure you apply before applying your eye shadow or you may end up with it running down your lid. This is a complete waste of money and an epic fail of a cosmetic product. On a scale from 1 to 10, I can honestly say that I give it a big zero! Save your money AND your sanity and look elsewhere."
2,"Good idea, poorly executed","We bought three of these units for my grandmother, and two of them died within the first two months, and the third died within the following month. They really do not have an easy return policy.The original version of this phone in the 70's was excellent, manufactured by ATT. This knockoff is poorly built."
5,An outcast at war in the gulf,"Turnipseed's book is about, in my opinion, the most noble kind of soldier, a reluctant warrior. Turnipseed had been AWOL for a few months before Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1991. He was a philosophy major at the University of Minnesota, and when he went to Saudi Arabia in January, he brought a number of his books with him. He views the war from his own quirky (and yes, liberal) standpoint, but he also does a good job of looking at it through the lens of the works of Plato, Thoreau and a host of other philosphers. During his time in Iraq, he comes across a number of sympathetic and not so sympathetic characters -- they all spring to life from the pages through his descriptions and dialogue. There are a number of really good reviews on this site that do this book more justice than I do...read them.I really wish they would teach this book at West Point."
1,Not worth it,"It's generic and limited the author only gives 2 examples of real life situations. The are no meanings really, it's all generic and vague.save your money."
2,"Same thing as reviewer ""Lexi""","JVC has such a great reputation, I didn't hesitate to purchase this player, since I still have some VCR tapes that I didn't want to get rid of as well as DVDs.I had the unit for under a year, and one day I tried to play at VCR and the picture just froze. Same thing happened when I tried to play a DVD.I checked completely. My television is fine; it is the unit.Very disappointed."
3,JVC DVD/VHS,"I am writing a review for a JVC DVD/VHS player which I bought 2 years ago. It was a great unit, but all of a sudden, the picture of both the DVD and VHS just turned to black shadows. What a dissapointment after only 2 years. I hesitate to buy another JVC player."
4,A great addition to my collection!,"This book sure has helped me! The patterns are listed alphabetically and each page is a new pattern with a color photo on top showing several of the pieces. The page tells you what colors each pattern came in, which once helped me identify a reproduction. There is also a listing of the pieces made and what their current values are. There is a section in the back (22 pages) that discusses how to identify reproduction pieces of certain patterns. The only thing that would help me more in this book is if they had included some kind of cross-reference so that you could quickly find your pattern based on its characteristics. As it is now, you either have to know its name or just thumb through the whole book. Well worth the money even to a beginner like me."
5,Necessary for Success,"I have been building my professional library and count Simone's book as a ""must have"" and ""most often consulted"" on a wide range of topics. This book is in my top 5 list and on any reading list that I prepare as an adjunct to presentations. The theoretical concepts supported by practical examples makes this book a most useful resource for the new and seasoned development professional. As the number of fundraising resources grow there are numerous books on special topics. For this reason and due to the caliber of this book, I hope that it remains widely available. Pearl Veenema (Toronto, Canada)"
5,Great Baptist History and Testimony!,"I bought this book after hearing Robert Rohm speak at a conference and at the time I was not Southern Baptist nor did I know who Dr. Criswell was. The testimony about Dr. Criswell's life and ministry really spoke to me and stirred up a desire in my heart to find out more about the man and how God blessed his faithfulness. This book is very well written and is very interesting. Most important to me is that I do not remember a line in the book that takes the emphasis off of God and places focus on Brother Criswell. Instead we are reminded of God's supremacy and the pastor's relationship with God. Every reader will not agree with Dr. C's doctrine, however the book doesn't make an issue out of that and every reader will benefit from the testimony as it is presented."
4,"not a shoddy cd, but just missing one good song...","this is the first real good collection of norman's music that i've come across. the hits are all here, including the late nite quiet storm classic 'you are my starship', featuring michael henderson. some cool tracks i discovered on this cd were "" be there in the morning"" featuring miss adaritha on vocals, and the title track to norman's 1977 lp ""romantic journey"". for the missing song, that would have to go to the song ""invitation"", which rapper mos def actually sampled to perfection on the 2002 ""brown sugar"" soundtrack. other than that, this is a stellar release. thanks to buddah records and norman connors."
4,"Considering Norman's vast catalog, this CD is too shoddy!","Most of Norman's classic Buddah albums deserve to be reissued on CD. While this one has all the big hits, maybe it should have been a 2-CD set. Connors was a very important figure in 1970s jazz and he deserves a better and more complete anthology."
2,Censorship is a *****!,While I have to give it some stars for being wolf3d at heart this doesn't quite cut it. All swastikas have been removed as so not to offend anyone. Nazi speak english and die bloodlessly. Hitler has shaved his trademark mustache and changed his name to Staatmeister. Worst of all the censorship that nintendo did was change the dogs into mutant rats. So in summation it's kinda like the PC but is horrendously censored.
3,Bad Port but still Wolfenstein,"The SNES port of Wolfenstein 3d isn't really that good, and the censorship gets in the way of what made the original so great, but at the end of the day it's still Wolfenstein. If you're a wolfenstein fan and a snes fan, add this to your collection. The levels are slightly different from the original which makes it a somewhat different run through from the original, which will still keep you entertained despite censorship and low quality graphics (compared to pc)"
3,"First notes artificial, drydown ain't bad at all","Upon first application, this cologne has a very big ""I Am A Cologne"" scent, which I associate with cheap perfumes. After that dissipates, though, the remaining scent is okay. Not overly vanilla-based and foody, not smoky vanilla-incense-y, but not so very bad for the price."
3,Not very vanillaish,My son wanted cologne that smelled like vanilla and this was the only one I could find. It really just smells like alcohol and the bottle is soooooo small. Also no sprayer if you were interested in knowing that.
3,Not what I expected,Has no vanilla scent whatsoever but does smell good. My gf LOVES it so I guess it is all good over here. Just wont buy again tho
3,"Decent shoe, good price","The show is ok. It is not extremely comfortable or uncomfortable. I got it for a great price, so I am happy with the purchase. Shipping was great and it came pretty quickly."
1,Product doesn't work,"It just does not work. Putting it on before stimulation, as directed, does not work. Putting it on after stimulation is impossible because it is too difficult to close."
1,worthless,"Total waste of money. By the time i maul my penis half to death getting it on, my penis remains flaccid. All I get is a limp chaffed cock. Get something else."
3,A Lazy Day for the Editor,"I am a huge fan of the Blade series. I am very anxious to see the 3rd installment of it. I thought that the novelization of the movie would tide me over until the actual movie came out. I was right on that. It seems to be a very fun flick. My only problem with the book is the writing and editing. I imagine that the editor's job is to relieve the book of any grammatical errors and sloppy writing. Neither of those jobs were done. Instead of enjoying the book as much as I should have, I was constantly fighting my annoyance over such trivial mistakes. Long story short, if you're looking for a good way to precede the movie it's worth picking up, but don't expect too much from the writing. The movie comes out Dec. 8th so hopefully everyone will see it."
1,Meat is good!,"The recipes in this cookbook were terrible, i have been thinking of going vegan for a long time, but this book reaffirms why I eat meat... because vegetables aren't that tasty, no matter what you do with them."
2,Disappointing,"Humorous gay fiction. I enjoy this genre. I've read quite a few books recently that fall into that category. Quite a few good books. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. I found I could not empathize with any of the characters; they seemed too stereotypical and self-serving. As far as plot goes, it was, at best, cute. It was adequately written, but I didn't find myself laughing or even cracking a smile while reading. There are no memorable lines; no amusing lines. It was a [very] mindless, light read. If you want to read a good book in this particular genre, there are plenty of other alternatives. For example: ""It Had To Be You,"" ""The Best Man,"" ""Fool's Errand,"" or ""California Screaming."" This book probably doesn't even belong in this category."
2,Can't Buy Me Love or a great book,"An easy read, but also not a very good one. The characters are stereotypes, the plot is contrived, and the ending is annoyingly sweet.There are many other books of this genere (light Gay fiction) that are much better!"
4,I never recieve the magazine,"I am still waiting for my first issue of the magazine. So, I am unable to rate the magazine until I recieve the first issue."
4,A Little Bit of Indian,This is the best book I have ever found on researching unverified Eastern Cherokee ancestory. It covers sources from early colonial through removal. This book also has the best maps I have ever seen showing the original Cherokee homelands. Well worth the trouble to locate a copy.
5,one of my favorite books... period,"i have always loved toe works of dan abnet, ever since i read my first novel from him. this is by far the best one yet. he continually out does himself time and time again. the only thing i dont like is the wait between his latest and his next novel!"
3,Missing something....,"I was really excited to see that TNT had a new cd on the way and was curious as to how life would be without Tony Harnell.Well,after hearing The New Territory I'm not sure where they are going. I wanted to like this one,really,but after hearing them thru the years,and then listening to this latest effort,I was somewhat disappointed.But I guess that the bar was raised so high on My Religion and the follow up ""All The Way To The Sun"",that there was only one way to go from there.It's not that it's THAT bad,there is just nothing remotely close to their previous offerings on this cd.Maybe a reunion with Harnell is in the future to return this once mighty band back to their hallowed status among the top Melodic rock groups of our time. Good luck guys."
4,A New Direction,"I am so glad that TNT is finaly playing some rock again. This album is not written that well, Yet they have mutch potential they lost in 1987. Look out for future music. It will get better, Possably outstanding."
2,Not the same without Harnell,"Not to knock Tony Mills, as he is a good vocalist in his own right, but I just feel this is one band that lost their spark without the original singer. There were a few tunes on this release that were earily similar to the sound of Harnell that truly made half of the TNT sound, but overall, it has a competely different sound and feel. I understand that when you switch singers, there should be an evolution of sound or a new direction; I just wasn't impressed with the direction. I have yet to hear the new Atlantis release by TNT. Hopefully I will like it better;)"
3,Weight limit,"Just a word of warning - the weight limit (which is NOT listed on the outside packaging, but rather on the printed instruction sheet inside) is 42 lbs. My four year old is 43 lbs., and had I known this limit, I would have bought something sturdier. The packaging outside just says 3-6 years."
3,Not for kids over age 4,"I got these for my daughter when she was about 2 years old, and that seems to be a fairly ideal age for these skates. Indoors they roll pretty well, making pulling her along fun, but on the sidewalk it's a nightmare. Now, a couple months shy of her 4th birthday, she's completely done with these since she sees our neighbor's kid whizzing by with real skates. The knee and elbow pads are nice, but also sized pretty small. I can't believe they advertise these for ages 3-6. Any six year old would tell you in no uncertain terms that these are ""baby skates""."
4,Book purchase review,I bought this book at a really reasonable price and was surprised at the condition of the book. It was well maintained. Didn't look new but didn't have much damage to it.
2,Expected better,"Dont waste your time on this CD. Not the hard hittin sound I was expecting. Ive bought several other Tazmania CD's and this one just doesnt flow well. Try Tazmania Mega Mix Volume 4, much better."
2,french language course,I had hoped to be able to use the course while driving around. However the course is very dependent upon the printed material which makes it useless for what I intended.
4,Just what I needed,Very good and inexpensive dictionary for a beginner-intermediate who wants to expand their vocabulary - many definitions are shown in their common usage in phrases which I appreciate.
2,disappointing!,"No didactical at all, very boring, bunch of words grouped together in lessons pronounced in good french though, very little conversation, not what I expected. Wouldn't recommend it!"
2,book,I would recommend spending the money on Rosetta Stone. I bought this and later bought Rosetta Stone. I found this product to take more time to learn and was not as easy as using rosetta stone.
5,Thalia: 32 Classics...,"This compilation is one of the most comprehensive ever released by Thalia. There are two CDs each with 16 songs, totaling 32 songs, hence the title ""Serie 32"". It presents most of the tracks extracted from the albums ""Thalia"" (1991),"" Mundo de Cristal"" (1991) and ""Love"" (1992). Classics like ""Un Pacto Entre Los Dos"" ""Marimar"" and ""Maria Mercedes"" are some of the many services are present in this great collection of 2001."
2,Weak link of the series...,"Afterdark Chicago can't hold a candle to Afterdark New York. Unlike NY's soulful singing, chants and mantra's...Chicago is almost entirely instrumental with a more darker/slower feel. I could barely cardio to it. Not bad if you want the entire series but not a good one to start with."
3,"Good, but not the best","I have bought all of the Afterdark cd's and regretably this is the second worst (Madrid being the worst of the group). Frankly I was shocked that Traxx was not one of the labels picked for one of the cd's Nothing against Gudiance or Large, but Traxx is the godfather of the great music we listen to! Out of the two cd's Large, mixed by Jask was much better. Chris Braum really let me dopwn If you are new to house, by all means pick this cd up, otherwise, I'd say pass."
4,Deep house,"This is one of my favorite entries in the AFTERDARK series. The first disc was mixed by Ananada Project Soundsystem. It's very chillout kind of house, very deep and soulful. The second disc was mixed by Jask and is much more uptempo and will get you moving. There's some jazz elements. House heads will want to give this one a few spins!"
5,Chicago House Music Lives,This CD is one of the best that I have listen to in quite a while. Do your self a favor and pick this one up.-LG
2,Disappointed,"I found this book to be very technical and a hard read. I was hoping for a quick reference book to access when I wanted to look something up regarding what to eat. There are a few recipes but they seem to oppose what I have read about the diet for endometriosis. Many of the recipes contain eggs and other dairy products which are supposed to be pro-inflammatory.The general scientific nutritional advice is good, but it does seem to relate to general health problems. A good book if you want to find out about nutrition."
2,Hard to follow,"I was disappointed with the complex advice in this book which is hard to follow. The information is very technical and does not seem to focus on endometriosis as I had hoped for. I am sure those looking to find out about all the details of nutrition this could help, but there does seem to be some repetition of sections in the book, and I felt the book could have been more streamlined."
3,Just okay,"Unfortunately for me who have done lots of research on Endometiosis, this book did not provide me with much new information. Also found that too much time was spent on the biological aspect as compared to the nutritional areas. I believe that more time should have been devoted to nutritional healing."
2,"Good advice, hard to follow","Great advice, hard to change your life that much. Guess I am not hurting that bad or I would change my diet. lol!"
3,Lots of math and not very readable,"I have a master's degree in math and an interest in juggling. I am sure the author has a good understanding of the mathematics of juggling; however he does not seem to be able to convey it in a clear or understandable fashion. I tried reading through this several times and found it too confusing to get through, as things seemed to appear out of thin air with no background exposition. I feel I learned a few things from the book, but overall am disappointed."
5,The Morman Murders,"This is well written and gives an inside to Mormanism, it keeps a reader drawn into the story. The format is great with the telling of the background of the reasons Mark Hofmann choose the items he forged."
5,Love this book,I love this book!For some time it was difficult to find (including in libraires). Read it once and decided it was so good that I needed to read it again - - true story!
5,The Mormon Murders,I thought it was very well written. You didn't lose your way when the author was telling the story. It was an eye opener for me. I had never realized just how much was covered up in the Mormon church. I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in a good non-fiction book with plenty of information.
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this book in the hopes that it would be a well-researched, balanced account of what happened. I was very disappointed to see the obvious prejudice and bias of the authors. The presence of an index but complete lack of reference material was also disappointing. The book was filled with stereotypes and generalities which I felt detracted from what could've been a very interesting book."
2,Writen like a novel,"I would not call this book history, more like historical fiction. Why? Because the authors state ""facts"" then hypothesize what may have happened behind closed doors, then act like their ideas are facts, with no proof. If you can get past the nonsense, the book is a good read. But if you cut out the guess work and conjecture, the book will get cut in half."
5,Streetnoise,"When I was young, my older brother owned this album and I listened to it frequently. Julie Driscoll is one of the best and more under-enjoyed singers of the 60's Music Scene. Brian Augers Organ and Piano work is fantastic. The original songs are truly rare little gems of lyrical art, and the covers of other peoples songs are spectacular. My particular favorites are VAUXHALL TO LAMBETH BRIDGE, ALL BLUES, I""VE GOT LIFE, SAVE THE COUNTRY, and LIGHT MY FIRE. I've enjoyed listening to this album hundreds of times in my lifetime, and have listened to it quite often since acquiring it lately on CD. It is one of my favorite albums of all time."
3,"Bluesy, Jazz-Fusion Tracks Works Fine - Others Tracks Not Quite There","Her bluesy vocals work fine when she's belting out over the jazzy fusion tracks but not so much when she's required to sing more delicately or she's supposed to wrap her words around and have her voice as an instrument in the mix (as with proper jazz vocals) - on those tracks, she sounds like just she is doing one thing and the musicians are off on their own thing. It's particularly telling in the version of (The Doors) Light My Fire. The musicians are playing it as bop/light jazz fusion but she's belting like she's Janis Joplin - she's no Janis - she's not even Joss Stone."
3,Good toy. Bad Price.,"This exact toy is available for $19.99 at [...]. I bought one and it deflated after about a month. The horns and tail are a tad sharp for younger children. A great gag gift, no real educational value and its poorly constructed."
4,MUCH faster camera downloads compared to USB 1.1!,"I just received this product. After opening the package, I plugged it into my Macintosh PowerBook G4 computer's FireWire port. It immediately displayed the Compact Flash card as a removable drive. Reading and writing were exceptionally fast (as expected for FireWire 400). The device required absolutely no configuration whatsoever in order to function correctly.Except for the fact that it only reads/writes to Compact Flash media (some readers have multiple format capability so I only gave this one 4/5 stars), it's an outstanding device. It comes with its own FireWire cables, so this saves a few dollars.If you've been downloading pictures with USB 1.1, this device is well worth the money, given the time and frustration you'll save yourself. Plus, you can upload new firmware such as the hack to unlock some Digital Rebel features (http://satinfo.narod.ru/en/index.html).-Dan W"
2,"Good reader, but stopped working after a month","Everything was nice for a month or so, but then without any warning it stopped working. It might be a good idea to disconnect the reader from the PC when reader is not in use."
2,Delkin reader/writer,Reader is slower than I expected. Sometimes when I insert the flash card nothing happens. If I disconnect it and then reconnect it works. I am quite disappointed in this product.
3,Sweet - 2.75 stars really,"This is a fairly good story. If I used a grading system like school, I'd probably give it a ""C+"". The only way to describe it is sweet, or nice. There's no real ""tension"" between the hero & heroine. It is a different Regency in that the hero is a French prisoner of war, instead of a down-on-his-luck Duke or something like that. The characters are well developed, the plot is interesting, but still...it's lacking that tension between the hero & heroine. A just-good-enough read, but not a keeper."
2,Not as expected,"This item had a very cool look, for that it gets one star. However the volume was so low that you could not enjoy the music. Hence, defeating the reason you bought it in the first place. There are some cheaper models that do a much better job. I returned the product."
3,Bottle Too Small,"This product is good but for the price, it's not enough in the bottle. They say you get three hundred sprays but you have to spray your face from a distance at least 4 or 5 times; that means I have to buy a bottle every three weeks? No! I haven't even had it for a full week yet and it's halfway gone! So I don't like the deal you get for the money. I'm trying out new products and they all are expensive. Skindanavia has one that works great and the cost is $40 for 6 ounces so you get 4 more ounces for another 20 bucks, two ounces free, I guess. The Skindanavia product is a better for your skin."
2,Lacking in Quality,"The bench I received was not assembled correctly. Pad was mounted crooked on the frame and the adjustment mechanism would not operate properly. I sent it back. I was not impressed with the quality, materials or workmanship of this product. I purchased a Hoist bench locally and have been happy with that one - better quality but more expensive. You definitely get what you pay for! I would avoid this product... I don't recommend it."
3,Pin wont fit. Needed a drill,"Nice looking, sturdy, comfortable and would otherwise be easy to asemble except for the fact that one of the pins would not pass through the pre-drilled holes. It required a drill and a metal drillbit to enlarge the whole. It was only then that I could complete asembly. This problem was mentioned on a few reviews. That is why I'm rating this product with only 3 stars."
1,Bad construction,"Okay, so if this thing fit together right, it would be great. But, the side that has the leg pads would not fully extend so that the holes would line up right for the adjusting pin to fit into it. It even looks like maybe someone tried to file down part of it to make it fit, with no success. Anyway, I didn't feel like putting this thing back in the box and returning so I jerry-rigged it to work, although now I cant easily fold it completely down for storage, which in my case is okay."
4,returned,I returned this because I ordered the wrong item. I have not seen a credit yet. How long does this take?Robyn
4,An actual good tribute album?? Yes!,"It isn't often that a tribute album can stand on its own two feet, but this Smoking Popes tribute manages to do just that.Featuring some solid choices and performances, even the odd misstep (""Off My Mind"") can't derail a very enjoyable album that does the boys proud."
2,Scratched DVD,"The first time I played the DVD (right out of the case) it stalled and froze. We cannot watch it the entire way through because it is freezes. I'm not sure if it's a refurbished disk or just poor quality, but I would not buy from this seller again."
3,Wee Sing in Sillyville,"I got from my sister-in-law Wee Sing Rock Candy Mountain, Wee Sing Kingdom, & Wee Sing Train all on VHS that her kids loved when they were small. After my 18 month old also seemed to fall in love with these tapes I decided to add to our Wee sing collection. I read a few reviews before buying Wee Sing in Sillyville which all seemed like good reviews. However personaly I am disappointed in this one - it just doesn't have the same effect as the others. I think the songs aren't as catchy & original and our son also seems to like the characters better when they are in big ""puppet"" type costumes instead of alot of the ones here are dressed up people."
2,not as good as Wee Sing Train,"This video is significantly more annoying than I thought it would be given the other reviews. We (parents and kids) liked the Wee Sing Train a lot. This one is more trite, with less interesting songs and plot. As a parent, I hate to be in the room with this one; usually I prefer to choose videos I can enjoy with my children."
1,never got it,The products were due to arrive on April 14 but I haven't received anything yet. What can I do ? How can I trace them.Thank youMonica Cincotta
5,Great child dvd,Great dvd for children. gave as gift and had no response yet. Bought this dvd years ago for my grandchildren and they loved it.
5,I love them!,I grew up watching the Wee Sing tapes -It has been over 20yrs since I have ever seen one and they are still burned into my memory. My husband and I are about to start our own family and I am definitely going to purchase as many of these as I can for our children to watch!
4,wee sing in sillyville,"This is a great dvd for preschoolers, we bought it for our grandson he's just 18 months and loves it"
5,"Wonderful, timeless and entertaining!","My 3 children grew up watching Wee Sing videos since 1990 and Sillyville is one of our favorites! My daughter with disabilites LOVES Sillyville. Solid kid classics, colorful costumes and superb musical and dancing perfomances PLUS great underlying life lessons and values about cooperation, care, tolerance and optimism. I am sooo glad Wee Sing dvds are out now.....I've replaced our vhs versions over & over! Highly reccommend this series to ages 2 and over; great for gift giving.Our other WS favs: Musical Mansion, WS Together and Best Christmas Ever."
5,Toddlers LOVE this video !,"My son is almost two and has been watching this video for months now. He absolutely loves it and every child who has seen it with him gets engrossed as well. It has people and children singing and dancing, not cartoons. Really cute!"
5,Old favorite is new again!,"Thank goodness this video made it to DVD. My oldest son (who is now 16) loved this video when he was a toddler. And now my 3 year old son as well as my 20 month daughter are enjoying it just as much as my oldest did. Kids loving watching kids and they love music and dancing. This video is filled with just that. If your kids love being silly, this is a great video to add to your collection."
5,Great fun for little ones,"I use to work in a day care when this first came out and the kids watched it every week during our ""TV Time"". The kids danced with the music and they sang the songs over and over! Now I have ordered it for my son (19 months) and I can't wait to sing the songs with him!"
5,Still a favorite for kids of all ages,I got this as a gag gift for my daughters 21st b'day because she absolutely loved it as a child. She still loves it and knows all the words to all the songs. I have a two year old grandson and it is the only video that he wants to watch now when he comes over. Definitely has withstood the test of time!
5,wee sing silyyville,My daycare loves sillyville it is thier favorite.They watch it every day. The up beat music and very bright colors are appealing to 3to5 yr olds. It is a very sutle teaching tool.
5,Great product!,Thanks for the great business! The product came on time and was exactly what I expected. The kids love this DVD.
4,Great Kid Imagination Movie,This is an old classic.I watched it when I was a kid and my 4 month old baby loves it too!
1,Change that star rating,"I sent the reveiw for this one to the wrong seller. This one was fine, just what I ordered and received in a timely fashion."
5,Wee Sing in Sillyville,"This is a fun musically based DVD that is very well done. I would recommend the Wee Sing products for young children. You will find them laughing, and singing along with the musical characters."
5,Wonderful movie,"I watched this movie and tons of other wee sing movies when i was a little kid and i LOVED them. maybe times have changed and kids are demanding other types of entertainment but it really is fun to watch when your that age, the bright colors and magical type of land they live in is really enjoyable for children. as well these tapes are now collectibles and you probably some day wont be able to find them anoymore...thats why im buying all the ones i watched when i was little."
5,WEE SING - SILLYVILLE,we rec'd this video many years ago when my son was a toddler (he's 14 now) I loaned it to someone and didn't get it back. This is the one video that all of our family continued to remember. There is an awesome message for children about getting along. Lots of dancing and singing. I bought this video recently for my friend's 3 yr old. She watched it 3 times the first day and is singing the songs. I would recommend this to everyone. Wait til' you meet Sillywhim.PS we bought a new copy for our family also - you are never to old for a little dancing and singing...
5,A Great Message in an Enjoyable Format,"We originally rented this movie from our local library - my boys (18 mos. and 3 1/2 yrs) loved it so much that i bought them their own copy. Great songs and a fun storyline...I enjoy watching it as much as they do! The message is pretty powerful, too. Acceptance and friendship are among the many virtues addresses in this DVD. I recommend it to all parents."
1,Quality of DVR,"I usually don't have a problem with the merchandise I purchase online, but in this case I will Amazon keeps asking for my opinion....no problems with the mailing and receiving portion of the transaction that was fine...the quality of the DVR tape was terrible((think tapeing your tv shows on a VCR back in the day and then watching them)) very disappointing...............If your thinking of buying a Wee Sing DVR the children will love it, 5stars*****,just be careful who you purchase it from."
5,Kids love it!,"I bought Wee Sing Sillyville over twenty some years ago as a VHS for my kids which they loved and now I updated to a DVD for my friends that are having Grand babies. I bought an extra one for myself...saving it for my grand babies. Wonderful music with meaning behind it, very catchy tunes the kids will join in and dance too."
5,Wee Sing In Sillyville,"I love this video! I wish they would make more videos about Sillyville and the characters featured in this video! I know that is not practical, since it was made in 1998 and kids grow up too fast, but I love the video! Buy it for your kids, they will love it too!"
5,Love this video,"My family purchased this video years ago for my cousins and to this day, they talk about Sillyville being their all-time favorite childhood video. Now that I have a daughter, I was so excited to find it! I bought two more for my friend's kids!"
4,Excellent Quality,"This headset is a good quality product. It'll last longer than all of those other headsets you can get for the same price. The only gripe I have about it is the way it hurts my ears.. My sister complains about the same thing, after 20-30 minutes of wearing them, your ears will become irritated and turn red. Ours did anyway..But still, unless you have extremely sensitive ears, these are great. I actually scared a friend's dorm mate when I was voice chatting with her, because she thought someone else was in the room with them.. the mic is that clear, no kidding.The speakers are nice too. Good bass, I can turn the volume all the way up on my computer and there's no static at all. These things are definently worth the money."
4,Remember folks...this is SATIRE,"...so remember to open your mind and exercise your sense of humor when you read this hilarious book. I read it in the '80's, early '90's and again just this year, and every time I find another gem contained within its pages. Not only will you be treated to a highly entertaining, biting piece of satire, but you'll come away with lots of new ammo in your own snappy come-back arsenal.As always, you'll look at the world a little differently after this Imus encounter."
2,A disappointment; neither literate nor funny; a ripoff,"This book, incredibly hyped on Imus radio show two years ago, is actually a reissue of his 1982 book, a failure then and a failure now. Readers, especially those who waited in line up to three hours for a signed copy should feel especially ripped-off. And the publisher, Simon & Schuster, should feel ashamed of itself"
1,No surprises.,"I've actually watched the Imus show at various times for the same reason I can get hypnotized by TV preachers -- they're so unbelievably bad that I can't believe anyone buys it. I have never heard ""the I-man"" say anything that was remotely witty, insightful or urbane. I may have missed it amidst the mumbles and gum snapping but I doubt it. So I certainly picked up this book with some prejudice, wondering if I might find myself surprised by a talent on the page not in evidence in his other venues. Nope. Clumsy phrasing, telegraphed gags and heavy-handed critiques. As another reviewer remarked this ain't Elmer Gantry. But then Elmer Gantry was written by a writer."
4,He nailed it... So to speak.,"I grew up in the part of the world where this book is set, and Mr. Imus nailed it. People who compare it to ""Elmer Gantry"" need to quit showing off their Liberal Arts degrees and bring me another beer chop-chop if they want a full 15% gratuity.Its best parts happen inside Billy Sol's head as he steers his life based on the twisted morality he learned out in a part of the world where people believe in God because the land is too godforsaken to have happened by chance. He got the voice and the tone down really well. And any straight man who doesn't wish for his own Step-Edna has no soul."
1,Demands a 0-star category!,"I didn't know who Don Imus was when I picked up this book. I looked at the synopsis and it sounded interesting. Wow was I ever wrong! Usually if I buy a book I don't like, I donate it to the library, but this trash I just had to throw out with the garbage. Obviously I didn't finish it, but I did try the first 35-50 pages. I recommend that anyone that considers reading this book find out who Don Imus is first; only those who can stomach him would be able to enjoy this book."
5,god's other son... imus is audio's patron saint!,"the audio version of this book is flat brilliant. the impact is equal to h.g.wells' ""war of the worlds"" in terms of delivery, and deadpan sincerity. this may be one of the best conceptfiction recordings ever. truly amazing, andhillarious at every turn. step edna, my dominatrixfrom hell... billy sol, my saviour!!!"
3,Could be better,"We have two of these - one of them assembled and has held up fine but the base of the other one could be better. The area of the plastic base where the thin bottom supports attached ripped out, reducing supporting and causing water to leak out of the base. Even when full the hoop shakes a bit, but for the money it is still a pretty good deal - be careful when assembling the base."
1,miss SUPREME DIVA did it again,What can I say that hasn't been said before about my beloved Kristine? She is simply the best. Her voice is so powerful and soulful. It is so sad that her label is not promoting her at all. Shame on you guys! Stronger is indeed a reflection of Kristine. That song is so amazing that I can't stop listening to it. Hopefully she'll be in Montreal again this year at the Black and Blue Party. I gave her only one star because I couldn't give her 10.... 5 stars will never be enough for Miss Perfection W!
5,Stronger,"Absolutely fantastic. . .and that's probably an understatement. Kristine W is back, and she is definitely STRONGER. I love the album version, but the remix version by Johnny Viscious is a dance floor experience not to be missed. The actual album release date is September 12th and I plan to be ready and waiting for it. If this doesn't thrust Kristine W into the mainstream, then nothing will. Don't pass up this CD when you see it"
1,A poorly conceived effort for a good idea.,"I purchased both the book and the cassettes. The book contains many phrases which, as a frequent traveler to Thailand, I find myself wanting to use. However the audio cassettes, which is merely a page by page reading of the book, is an extreme disappointment. What with its five tones the Thai language is extremely difficult for the westerner to grasp - and merely pronouncing each phrase once in rapid fire Thai is not helpful to one who is trying to learn the subtleties of this rich foreign tongue. There are no pauses in the tape for the listener to repeat the phrases - there are no repetitions of the phrases - as in the Pimsler method of learning languages - so one is merely left with a soundtrack to the book - which will leave the neophyte Thai speaker no closer to mastering the language."
2,"Great concept, but poorly executed.","The book version of the tapes fills a void that most Thai - English dictionaries leave in that it provides translations of phrases which most farangs will encounter in day to day life abroad in Thailand. However, the cassettes are merely a rapid fire recantation of the words in the book...with no slow syllable by syllable phrasing - so that a list ener can easily learn the hard to grasp Thai pronunciation. With its five different tones Thai is a difficult language for westerners to master, and these tapes do little to facilitate the task."
1,Thai for lover Book & tape,"Fun and Natural Thai I enjoyed listening to the tapes very much. They are spoken at the natural speed of Thai speakers and are easy to follow when used with the book (the book and tapes need to go together). The content is fun and the tapes are clear. If you are serious about speaking Thai to your lover, these tapes are a must!"
1,Useless,"This is no way to learn Thai. Two uneducated Thai people sitting at a table with a sex tourist reading simplistic sex talk in Thai. If one is trying to learn Thai they will have no success here, since the narrators speak poorly and also way too fast for you farangs to learn"
1,A rip off. Avoid at all cost.,This is so lame and poorly conceived that one would think it was an educational initiative from George Bush. The authors never gave a moment of thought as to how one learns a new language - through building skills through repetition and learning the basic sounds of a language. There is neither here. All there is a poorly recorded (the sound levels change drastically from speaker to speaker) recitation of the accompanying book. The book is a monument to stupidity and nothing short of a rip off.
2,Customer Service was Aweful,"The glove works well... but when I only received the left glove Amazon gave me the run around and I was calling between them and the company that would be shipping the gloves. I took me a little over an hour to get everything sorted out. In the end, it wasn't even amazon that solved my problem. They left me solve my own problem."
3,"Good writing, movie-like plot","Bukiet writes well about blindness, conveying a keen sense of his protagonists' reliance upon others and his other senses in order to stay alive. This could have been worked well into a parable about the Middle East-- how the religious ecosystem, with one holy place on top of another, demands a forever-uncertain reliance on others. This seems to have been completely ignored, however, in favor of a roller-coaster political thriller. It was an enjoyable book, but one that a) only revealed a superficial understanding of the religious depths of conflict in the Middle East and often resorted to caraciatures rather than true examination and b) seemed to dumb itself down to find a more common-ground audience.Bukiet is a very good writer and is capable of more."
3,decently entertaining,"I am a huge fan of Breath of Fire 2 and can play it for hours and days on end. I was hoping the first one would be just as addicting. Unfortunately I was less than impressed, but at least I have yet another vintage SNES game within my collection. :)"
2,"Tepid, in a very British way.","These appear to be made-for-telly movies from the 1970s. The results are mixed. I found ""The Devil's Disciple"" to be the best of the lot, thanks to a lively pace and good casting. ""Heartbreak House,"" at the other extreme, is nearly incomprehensible. Lynn Redgrave's Eliza Doolittle is a pleasant surprise. The rest are pretty dull."
4,"Good collectionn, but missing one thing.","This is a good collection of plays by George Bernard Shaw, including Pygmalion, Arms and the Man, and Heartbreak House. But one important G.B.S. play is missing from this collection. How can you have a collection of plays by Shaw and not include Major Barbara!!!!!?????"
4,Fun,"If you like Shaw, you will definitley enjoy this collection of fine actors portraying his lesser known plays as well as a few popular ones. This is old but worth your while."
2,I wouldn't bother,"Unless you are a Bernard Shaw fanatic I wouldn't bother. These are mainly BBC 1970's 'Play of The Month"" TV Shows. Low cost theater style productions which works with Dickens and George Eliot but not for BS. I haven't been able to watch any play all the way through."
2,Just can't hack it!,"I've tried repeatedly to watch even one of these stories all the way through but just can't get past about half way into them ( and I tried 6) These stories are very effective as stage productions and I've enjoyed them as such but as short films, they are just plain boring and ultra talky. Sorry, not my cup of tea!"
2,One key flaw,"The issue I ended up having with the cross, is the loop for the chain is only bent together and not a solid piece. What ended up happening to me is that the loop kept opening and the cross would fall off. It took a little while before it started to happen, but the effect kept compounding to the point where I couldn't wear it anymore. Besides that though, it is very nice."
4,Celtic Knot Cross,"I am pleased with my purchase of the Celtic Knot Cross. It goes well with my antique sterling chain. The 2"" cross is just the right size. My only concern is the bail. It is only bent to adhere to the chain and seems to be sturdy. However, one piece of the bail meets the other and over time I wonder if it will open and I could lose my Celtic Knot Cross. One should be aware of this when they purchase."
1,"MMS=good, DVD=dreadful","I think MMS is great stuff. However, this DVD is a horrid promotional vehicle. Educated and intelligent viewers will be repulsed by the bumbling incoherence of its primary spokesmen Messrs. Humble and Abraham. Maybe Jim Humble is actually 200 years old, so I should be impressed by what MMS has done for him? The only bright spot is Dr. John Humiston, the fresh-faced American MD interviewed at his clinic in Hermosillo, Mexico. Watch the video for Dr. Humiston alone (he is good, though not great) and be careful with whom you share the rest, lest your intelligence and judgment be impugned by association.Here's the gist of the presentation: Chlorine dioxide is a weak oxidizer which attacks pathogens but leaves body tissues alone. By contrast, oxygen, ozone and chlorine which are far more potent and disruptive to body tissues. MMS can be ingested or injected to blast bacteria, viruses and parasites. Enjoy!"
5,I thi think that it is an excellent text.,I think that the book is very good on the fundamentals of manufacturing and a must read. It serves as an excellent reference book in my opinion and is well worth its high price tag.
3,Had to buy this book didnt want to,"this book was for class. overall it was good at explaining things, but I think more practice problems/questions would have been helpful"
2,Disorganized and Incomplete,"This book is very frustrating to learn from. The chapters are assembled with no rhyme or reason with completely different topics covered in the same chapter. If you are going to do the review questions, plan on getting an additional reference such as Machinery's Handbook as this text lacks the tabulated values required to do the assigned problems. There are several misprints throughout the book as well."
2,Not the best text book ever,"Colorless and high priced, though I bought it at the book store for 88.00. Sections are laid out poorly, but key words and ideas a pre-highlighted. About the same information given in any material science book, just different layout."
4,Quick Delivery,"I received my textbook in the estimated time frame, and it was in pristine condition. Very happy with the provider and I would purchase from them again in the future when I need more textbooks."
4,"Rock Me, Lynyrd Skynyrd!","Get out your lighters and timeworn Skynyrd T, mulletheads, as the ultimate soundtrack of your proud lives is here! The mullet is a haircut bar none, also known as the Ape Drape, the Soccer Rocker, the Shorty Longback, and it is celebrated thoroughly in this 2 CD compilation, not only for its inherent entertainment and party value, but its cultural significance, as well. Okay, perhaps that would be looking for subtext that runs only as deep as an Appalachian township's gene pool, but you get the picture, dude. This collection - infectious, sing mindlessly-in-your-car fun - truly rocks, 35 tracks from the likes of Deep Purple, George Thorogood and the Destroyers and Kansas. It certainly captures the spirited vibe of this free-wheelin', take-no-... attitude, and despite the very infrequent questionable track (The Hollies' ""Long Cool Woman""?), it is an anthemic tribute worth the ...bucks. ..."
1,incorrect facts in the first review.,"i've never read this book beforebut i wanted to point out that the first reviewer needs to refresh his history.the U.S. debt when regan became president certainly CANNOT be traced back though the revolutionary war.during WWII, the united states became, for the first time in it's history, a lender and not a debter country. this is because we needed to financially support the allied countries to defeat hitler, even though we never officially joined the war until after pearl harbour, which was much later.therefore, any debt that accrued when regan came into office would have been debt that was accrued between the 1950's and the 1980's. granted, it took at least 30 yrs to accrue 1 trillion and regan tripled that amount in three years... but i wanted to clear up the historical discrepency.i am in no way backing reagan, he was an advocate for the rich and the ""american dream"" at the expense of the working classes' lives."
3,"Past its ""Best by"" date","When this book was first published in 1963, it was excellent. It has been quoted frequently by subsequent writers and has achieved almost classic status. However, it is now showing its age, especially with regard to archaeology. The new two-volume commentary (vol 1 by Cogan, 2001; vol 2, Cogan & Tadmor 1988 - yes, it came out first) has superseded it. While it is still worth reading, especially for its insights into sources, it is now not the first choice commentary."
4,Enjoyable walk down memory lane!,If you are a current or former professional wrestling fan this game is a simplistically controlled fun time. Get the 4 player adapter and destroy Yokozuna!
3,Great in it's Time,"Back in the day, I use to play this game a lot. and I mean a LOT! In it's time, it had great graphics, great options, and was the type of wrestling game you could really let your mind run wild with, which is what I look for in wrestling games. Every year, 1 wrestling game catches my eye and I'll play it all year till the next great game comes out. When RAW came out for the Super NES, it is the game I played all that year.For the above reason alone, I would have given this game 5 stars. However, I took off 2 stars for Amazon's price. (...) $25 would be expensive for a game that old. Heck, even the NEW WWF RAW for X-Box is [less]. So, I would shop around before buying this game here."
5,great toddler chair,this chair is well made and sturdy. I love that it flips over to grow with your child.my toddler loves it and it's strong enough to hold up her big brother too!
2,Not quite as advertised,"Beware - in the list of specifications, this transformer is noted as being rated at 75VA - This is not the case, it's rating is just 50VA. Admittedly, I should have checked more thoroughly in advance, the it's also clearly a case of erroneous advertising in the Amazon specification description. In my intended application, this difference is (or was since it will no longer work) critical."
1,Artic Smartic,Why isn't this free? It's been out for 96 years and is of no historical/educational value. This belongs in the public domain and should be accessible to everyone at no charge based on it's worthlessness.I say once again (to those who consider buying this insignificant piece of nostalgia) Send me the $$$ and I'll give you something more worthwhile than this rubbish.
3,Rose Falcon,"Rose Falcon is a very pretty girl who obviously has talent in music. But I don't think that talent was completely visible in this album.""Up, Up, Up"", Rose's most popular song, has a good beat, and is a fun song to dance to. But it leaves something to be desired.My favorite song on this album is ""Looks Are Everything"". Rose's voice really sounds good, unlike some songs where she sounds like she's shouting. The song has a good message, and a good beat. Definately worth a listen.The rest of the album, however, was so-so, nothing special. I think Rose needs to improve vocally, and if she comes out with a second album, I hope it will have more enjoyable songs."
4,Primarily Political...,"The book is mostly about the political circumstances surrounding the fall of Saigon (and political events well before April 1975). If you're interested in the military and social aspect of the defeat (as I was), this probably won't be for you. Very dry reading."
1,Never got it to work,I bought this because I have an RCA TV and a Toshiba DVD/VCR. I spent over a week trying the codes and using code search and it never worked with either. There's both time and money I wish I had back.
5,Wee Sing King Cole's party,Awesome movie for young children. Keeps their attention. They will love to sing along.
3,"Well, if THEY like it...","I guess it really doesn't matter if I like it... It's pretty cheesey... but the kids like it. Alot. All three of our Wee Sing (Birthday, Train and King Cole) are enjoyed by 1-5 year olds in my home. Especially the Train one. Songs are catchy and memorable. It's harmless and wholesome. It's really about them anyway, isn't it?"
4,Wee Sing King Cole's Party,"This is my son's favorite video. It may be annoying to most adults, but in a child's eye, it seems to be quite magical. It's entertaining and to hear your child sing the songs is priceless!!!"
3,Wee Sing King Cole's Party,"My young grandchild loves the plot and singing. The graphics and costumes are quite out-dated, but that doesn't seem to be an issue for the group of toddlers & preschool children who have watched it."
2,Wee sing King Coles Party,Brought for granddaughter she didn't even want to watch 10 minutes of it. Disappointed in this one also. She loved wee sing in sillyville and rock candy mountain.
2,Fell apart,"Don't believe that you can wash this even on delicate cycle. The seams ripped apart and the stuffing came out, the first time we tried to wash it. Don't waste your money."
4,Pet Bed,My Yorkies jumped in their bed right away. It must be comfortable to them. Very atractive and would recommend.
3,Dog Bed,I purchased this dog bed for a fund raising event. So whoever won the gift baskent I hope they are happy. But how can they not be happy look how adorable the bed is.
5,Dynamic artistic masterpiece,"This CD ranks among the top 'ukulele cds in the world. His playing is fluid, graceful, delicate and aggressive, capturing the intricacies of the instrument. Hill expresses the traditional ""feel"" of the 'ukulele, taking it back to it's origins in the Pacific, while at the same time forcing a modernizing of the thoughts of what the instrument can do. The second I heard ""Little Wing"" I was blown away. Hill has taken a traditional and relaxed medium and shown that it can be a contende with the guitars and horns of the world. This cd is among my top 5 acoustical cd's in my collection."
5,Incredible!,"In this high-tech media blitz world that we live in (lip synching, backup dancers, product endorsements, playlists, light shows, ""gangsta"" culture, celebrity arrests, marketing departments & promotional ads, etc), it's great to know that one guy with a ukulele and *a lot* of energy, enthusiasm and creativity can get a cd like this out there! I've always loved it when an artist can sit down with little to no accompaniment and figure out how to keep his audience engaged and entertained with his instrument- James does this track after track! Anyone who likes Dawg, Chris Thile, Mike Marshall, Mike Compton, John Reischman, etc. will truly appreciate this album- and wonder why this guy isn't more famous. I downloaded this last night and I will be livid if, in the future, iTunes makes it ""inaccessible because of outdated software"" on my ipod. ipod sucks for taking away music that I paid for just because they wanted to force me to buy another MP3 player. It may not be an ipod next time..."
3,Veruy nice but could be better,"The case is very well constructed, well finished, and designed ok. It is the design where the case falls a little short The case is just adequite in size to hold a SLIM body 17in wide monitor laptop, JUST Adequite. But that's ok. There are sufficent pockets and slip in spaces for papers, PDA'S, and a few small pesonal items. Where the case falls short is they forgot the small but very hard with sharp pointed edge design of the portable battery charger converter. There is no place for it to be stored without bulging out the side of the case, or scratching up the laptop. Try and add the wonderful new wireless mouse and you have two large portrusions looking to be broken. The portrusions are just begging to be bumped and struck flat, and they keep the case from laying flat. A simple end pouch for a mouse and charger would have solved the problem, added no weight or extra size."
3,Good for the money.,"This case is good for the price and is very protective of my laptop. I wish it had more pocket area for briefs or note pads, but you certainly can't beat the value. If you are looking for a simple case to hold and protect your computer, then this is what you want, but if you are looking for a more professional look with extra space for documents, then I suggest spending a little more money."
3,Ok bag,"I like this bag pretty well, but it doesn't have a lot of extra space for things like laptop speakers. The fold pouch on the front can't even hold a couple of dvds without poking out and the slot on the back is open on the bottom, so if you papers in it, they can fall out. I rarely use it anymore. I ended up buying a laptop back pack which works a lot better for my needs. This bag would be better if you weren't planning on carry anything but your laptop and cord, pens, cellphone, ipod, etc with you. It's not great if you plan on carrying anything bigger."
4,perfect fit - and not too bulky,"This case fits my Dell Vostro 1720 perfect - There is just enough room to put the computer in the case and wedge the battery and wireless mouse in beside the computer. My computer is exactly 15.5"" wide. So, it is tight but it works fine. There is ample room in this case for slim papers and CD cases as well. The padding for the laptop seems sufficient and the material appears durable not cheap. Also, it is light and easy to carry. Overall, it is an attractive professional looking case."
3,Sticky Zippers,Great case for holding everything that goes with portable computer. The zippers seem to hang up as you go around the front corners.Both in opening and closing other than that it is great.tc
1,WORST C.D.EVER,THIS IS CRAP! PERIOD......I am 13 years old and know everything there is to know about music. PERIOD.
2,Resorts to Unsubstantiated Leaps of Faith,"I loved Holy Blood Holy Grail and expected the same level of thoughtful research/sleuthing to go into this sequel. I was disappointed.In HBHG, the theories were supported with some form of data, either historical, or logicial, or published, etc. In this book, many of the theories are simply presented and left unsubstianted... as if we are to accept them simply because Baigent and Leigh said so.I started to lose interest when they presented their evidence on the nature/identity of Judas Iscariot. Relying on a similarity between two sounding words does not an argument make!While I found HBHG highly believable, this book, in my mind, destroys Baigent and Leigh's credibility through the usage of flawed, unsubstianted, long leaps of faith.No one who presents compelling theories should rest on their laurels instead of their research."
3,Rocketing to Ennui,"This book begins powerfully, giving the reader fascnating information concerning the Emperor Constantine, the god Sol Invictus, and the formation of early Christianity. From there, it plummets into a disjointed ramble that leaves one with a sense of ennui. However, this book is well worth the price and time for the fascinating information in Section One."
3,Interesting,Very interesting premise based on evidence at hand. An open mind is definitely a prerequisite prior to delving into this book.
1,Not Worth Reading,"This book is a very poor follow-up of the book ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" by the same authors. ""Holy Blood, Holy Grail"" presents substanial amounts of opinion and speculation as fact. ""Messianic Legacy"" does nothing to correct that failure while adding virtually nothing of substance. Some claims the authors make in both books contradict the New Testament without citing remotely reliable sources from the early Christian era."
3,so so,It is not as good as HBHG but is is worth reading it.If you have graet inters in Roman Catholic history you wont be dissapointed with this book.But dont expect to much.First half of this book is great and it is right there where HBHG ended but the second part is way to dissapointing.It goes way of the subject.It is a good read to the half then u can just put it down.
2,Pandering for the dollar,"This is the kind of book that you just can't pick up. After reading ""Holy Blood,etc"" and enjoying it immensely, I expected more of the same. Not so. Instead I got a loosely connected screed about the Bible, Christianity, and whatever the authors could come up with just to fill up the pages. Boring and very disappointing."
1,Get Real!,I wouldn't waste my time reading this crap! This stuff is enough to gag a maggot!Are there so many ignorant people in this world who would seriously believe this? Anybody want to buy the Brooklyn Bridge?
2,Only the first part is needed.,"The first part (about 1/3 of the book) is quite interesting and has a lot of eye-opening information about first years of Christianity, early Church, etc. The other two thirds you can just skip. That is why my rating is five stars divided by three."
5,"More critical than Holy Blood, Holy Grail","The Knights Templar and several lateral outgrowths of it are the root for modern secret societies that exist today. They control the upper echelons of banking, finance, shipping and insurance. They start wars, launder money, run drugs and assassinate rivals at will. Elite families in Britain and America cannot be overestimated in the power, and this book brings things up to the twentienth century."
2,"Messianic Legacy--Not as Good as the Holy Blood, Holy Grail","I wanted to read this book because it was the sequel to ""Holy Blood Holy Grail"" but I was disappointed that much of the book did not deal with the same issues of the first volume. Even though most of the ideas have been disproven, they are still provocative and intriguing. However, The Messianic Legacy fell short for me."
1,Try Holy Blood Holy Grail instead,"This book, a sequel to ""Holy Blood Holy Grail"", was apparently precipitated by the commercial success of its predecessor. It is not nearly as engaging, or as interesting. see my review for ""Holy Blood""."
3,men of virtue,"The book most enlightening and a must on the shelves of any sage's repertoire. More precisely. ""Secret Masters"" by their power not only ""hold"" reality they manifest it - the true intent of it."
2,Plodding and dull,"Once you get past the hype and puffery of ""Holy Blood Holy Grail"" this series of books begins to seem quaint and ridiculous. The writing is unbearably earnest, and may frustrate the reader who is looking for a wild ride. People who already believe that the Freemasons run the world may appreciate it, though."
3,Comfortable Sleepwear,Attractive knit pattern that is not irritating to the skin. The halter is not burdensom is good stretch which doesn't pull or pinch the neck. The dress is a little short and prefer a pantie in lieu of a thong.
2,Poopy Pooper Scooper,"This product is not what I expected. I am a breeder and was looking for a decent ""pooper scooper"" for the yard. This thing is way to short for me. It seems to be a nice product but needs to be a bit on the longer side. I am not tall (5'6"") but this is sized for a youth."
4,Mortal Kombat 2,"Mortal Kombat 2 is one of the best games of its time. If the fighting skills aren't enough, the stories behind each character will make you want to find out more. It'll make you wonder what it would be like if the world of Mortal Kombat was real."
3,The best fighting game except for cheap AI,"All the mortal Kombat games are awesome save 3 which sucks and it the cheapest of the bunch. The AI in these games is nothing but cheap, stupid and pointless. No matter how good you are at these games the AI is magically better. You can beat them to danger then they magically don't die and can trow you in your mid sweep or uppercut WTF!?!?!?!? The player cannot do that?? When you jump they knock you down, if you jump ten times they knock you down ten times and they punch you over and over till you die, they are nothing but cheap predictable losers, just like Midway if you played the MKvsDC trash."
5,Great Game!,"Great game at a great price! Also, arrived quickly and in great condition. I would order from this seller in the future."
4,awesome,"Everything about this game is great with the only flaw being the box is a little worn. However, it is roughly 200 dollars less than buying it brand new, so cheers to the worn box."
1,really draggy,"tried 3 times to get interested in this book - too many half sentences, used phrases that were just not good ""thermosed the tea"" and ""perimetered the building"" Come on!!! Too clever by half. Have not read ""the innocents"" will have to get that one to see if he really can write or not. Gave up on this one. I agree with the reviewer - this book really drags."
1,Really hard to read,"Haven't read a Wil Hardesty book before but the jacket blurbs drew me in. I looked forward to wonderful writing, and because I used to live in Santa Barbara, to a great descriptive narration. What I found was stilted, precious efforts, attempts to coin ""different"" and original words and phrases which nevertheless came off as overly silly or awkward to the max in describing the scenes, actions, and characters. Put it down in 30 pages, though I tried hard to go on. It has gone back to the library."
3,Mooning,"This one dragged. Earlier books held interest easier and longer, this one was a chore. Hope the next is better because he can write."
2,"love wai lana, but this dvd just sucks","I love Wai Lana I always watch her morning shows whenever I happen to be up at that hour. The scenery is gorgeous and so is she! This DVD however, was highlyyy disappointing. Wai Lana is good as ever, but this video really can't be considered a fitness aid. All it contains is clips of different moves, when you click on the title its just her doing the move, no warmups or anything of the sort, no following moves to counteract the stretch like you're supposed to have. It does let you order the moves as you like and then you can play it sort of playlist style, but when you take the DVD out the order is not saved so you have to do it each time, that is if you remember the right order! I ended up selling this back on half.com, getting it was a huge waste of $, time, and effort. Good yoga DVDs are just hard to find-___-"
3,Not her best...,"This is my first oldie by Sherrilyn Kenyon and I have read and loved all her new books. I decided to get my hands on some her older and harder to find books that she had written at the beginning of her career. I was very disappointed in this book. There was a flaw in each main character that I found vastly irritating; the heroine, Alix, is constantly on the verge of tears and it gets repetitive after the first 10 times; the hero, Devyn, has no faith in Alix, even so close to the end. He's so willing to believe the worst in her. I thought he'd be able to rise above his misgivings.All in all this book just didn't grab my attention and I was easily distracted by other things. I love a book that keeps me reading into the small hours of the morning."
4,Premier Premier Premier,"Alieksey is a premier performer premiering the compositions of Sergio Assad. Assad is known as an amazing player, whose performances have an incredible number of musical notes. The project that Assad entrusted to Alieksey, the premier recording of Sergio's compositions, is significant.Vianna brings it off convincingly, offering renditions that are powerful, tender, incisive, and always musical.My personal favorite is Fantasia Carioca."
5,terrific read and great resource,"I have read and re-read this (both the fruit and vegetable book) and love them. They are a great resource for planting tips, growing, harvesting, possible problems and recipes for using for harvest. I have loaned them out and friends have enjoyed them too."
2,Patent book review,The primary limitation of this book is that it is out of date. Patent law has undergone significant change in recent years. It is best to use a book that is current.
3,Small Handbook,This is a small and basic handbook. No details and step-by-step instructions.Probably something you can do without.[...]
2,It's OK for a quick read,"This little booklet provides the most basic information about patents. I bought it thinking that it would be a good thing to supply new employees at my company. Although I think it is OK in terms of content (nothing particularly bad), I am not sure that there is anything interesting enough here to get anyone to really read through it.Most of this information can be found on-line and up to date from government websites. Although I have not checked, it would not surprise me to find this very information as it was created by the USPTO. Unless you are keen to have things in bound form, there really is no need to own this book."
1,great idea poor product,Cheap made production that would not work on any player I had..reordered because I was interested for the tape..that did not work either..black market style reproduction at premium price..should be removed from stock..
4,"Don't listen to others. ""Go West"" is a classic","""Go West"" is your typical Marx Bros masterpiece. For the life of me, I can't understand why it's so despised. Plenty of wonderful verbal comedy from Groucho while Harpo and Chico are great with their unique brand of physical and nonsensical dialogue. The plot moves quick and the terrible MGM romantic subplot isn't so terrible. 8/10""Room Service"" is another story. Very bland and family-friendly. The Bros' comedy is not very inspired here, but the weird setting is fascinating and makes for great ephemera. Watch this when there's nothing else on. 5/10"
3,Another Ok Marx Brothers Duo,"These films are only Ok but if you are a Marx Brothers fan, they are essential to own. The brothers are still full of antics and craziness, but the films seem underproduced and not as momentous as they used to. MGM generally tended to treat comedies as B level pictures and after Irving Thalberg's death, the Marxes were not accepted as A level stars."
2,How is it different from his older version ?,"Well he fixed all his bugs. He thinks he is in spiral model of life cycle publishing, Good Grief!Added few more projects which are poorly written, especially project www redirection - chapter 19. When I am paying 60 bucks, I expect some quality content. Oho, well maybe my expectations are more because he is targettng the student community. They are not paying you to read your book but they will download of some p2p file sharing network. We pay so I think I have every right to demand. The difference is obvious when a book is written by academic professor versus a professional software developer with tons of experience.I would suggest, stick to Richard Stevens, unless you are in that Texas school where he teaches."
4,Thank Capcom for RE4,"I played Resident Evil CODE: Veronica for the Dreamcast, when it was new, and thought, ""There's a good game ruined by poor controls."" When I replayed CODE: Veronica X on the PS2, I thought the same thing.Now, admittedly, I haven't played Outbreak, though I will, but Resident Evil 4 takes the awful control scheme from the previous games and tweaks it just enough to make the game fun. Add in a more well-developed plot, and RE4 alone makes this bundle worth buying.As for another reviewer who dismissed the fun of playing RE4 on a PS2 after having played it on the Wii? For shame. You can't compare the gameplay of a last-gen console with the Wii. It's like comparing apples and arsenic."
4,resident evil essentials,"This is exactly what I ordered, and was received in good time. I would purchase again."
1,Don't Understand,I do not get the game at all....very hard us control players....just did not like these games at all.....the kids though they love it.
4,Execellent,"It is a wonderful book and very complete in the fields it touches. very compact and very helpful. Missing? A more updated version. I also needed help with the gas section because this book was not enough, and definitely not good at all in drafting. The rest is excellent and a must in the preparation for the theoretical journeyman exam. Without it, it would be really difficult to get the license."
4,Plumber's Exam Preparation Guide,This book is extememly well prepared. I use this for reference material with my students. Waiting for an updated version.
4,Good research and strong historical analysis,"Kenyon has received serious criticism and charges of heresy from some of the ""brethren"" of our time. Yet his heart cry for Jesus is so obvious in all his writings, it seems hard to imagine his critics felt justified in their accusations. Joe McIntyre does fine research here into sources that were (a) available and overlooked by the critics, and (b) not reported because of bias. He also does a remarkable job in outlining Kenyon's beliefs and apologetics by contrasting them with leading figures of his time. This was one of the first books I've found that explains why those in the ""faith movement"" believe as they do."
4,For those who already know and appreciate Kenyon's writings.,"I find part of the title,""...the True Story"" somewhat vague. The author makes clear his appreciation of Kenyon's writings. As the author states, this book is not intended to be a biography (although it does contain some biographical information). Pastor McIntyre wrote this book in repsonse to 1 or 2 books written which have claimed that Kenyon was cultish. The author does a good job of showing that while Kenyon was influenced in his thinking by contemporaries, the Bible was his main influence. Pastor McIntyre also manages to be fairly objective in presenting Brother Kenyon as some one with faults just like us. I would not recommend this book for any one not already familiar with brother Kenyon's writings."
1,DO NOT BUY! Wrong item!,"This is not the printer. You will get a 64MB ram module for the printer. Amazon messed up on this and is not correcting the page, even after I brought it up to their attention. DO NOT BUY."
1,"Total fraud, NO KETTLEBELLS IN THIS WORKOUT","This really pisses me off. This DVD is packaged and promoted as a kettlebell workout, but there are NO kettlebells used whatsoever, except in the cover photo. I call that fraudulent. I went through Upper Body Power Sculpt, one of five included 10-minute workouts, which is demonstrated with light dumbells. I thought it was a warmup, but that was the workout. SAVE YOUR MONEY!I've never written an angry review on Amazon.com before, but this is just so obviously someone cashing in on a trend without bothering to buy a single kettlebell! The trainer is in average shape, in no way looks like she works out with kettlebells or even heavy weights.I'd put negative stars if that were an option."
3,Okay,"This is not even close to one of the safest or best Kettlebell workouts I give credit for the 10 minute intervals that allows you to pick the length of your workout. The instructor was upbeat and not annoying, so that's also a plus."
3,Where's the kettlebell?,Instructor uses a dumbbell in all routines. It's a shame because I liked the routines and the pacing. Put a kettlebell in the instructors hand and I'd give it 5 stars.
1,Misnamed DVD (Nothing to do with Kettlebells),"The parties responsible for this DVD decided to jump on the kettlebell bandwagon by calling it ""Kettle Bell Ultimate Fat Burner"", a more appropriate name would have been 'Dumb Bell Ultimate Fat Burner'. The cover states 'No Kettlebell Required' but shows the instructor holding a kettlebell. For all of the workouts, she used a dumb bell and not a kettlebell. Anyone familiar with the two pieces of equipment knows that they are handled and used differently. There was no effort in bringing in kettlebells or how to use one during the exercises.I'm very disappointed and do not recommend this DVD when there are so many other kettlebell DVDs done by qualified individuals."
2,more quads than arms,"I expected more arms than quads, it was okay, but not very engaging or fun. I use this with other videos just to get some extra cardio in."
4,Very good service,"Hello, I just order'ed a Front plate for my Truck, And I like alot. Plus the service was very good & super fast Thank you..."
4,Loved them!,"They made a great impression on our family members. Great to celebrate the birth of our second Child. The chocolate was very tasty, and believe me... I know chocolate. =)"
3,how many days for priority shipping?????????,"Can't say much about the product itself. was a gift for friends in California who had just given birth and it arrived 5-6 days after shipping totally melted. The seller gave early warning before shipping stating the weather had been abnormally hot and that they could not be held responsible for packages missed and left to sit in the heat. I assumed that was not an issue considering my wife was at their home and aware the package would be arriving and I had also purchased priority shipping (additional $8+dollars). No such luck. Be sure whoever you are buying these from gives you absolute specifics before you buy.Just to be fair, I have to say the seller was very quick and courteous with responses to my concerns. Unfortunately she didn't even consider any form of compensation though. I really hate throwing money away and giving a less than memorable gift at the same time."
4,"Good chocolate, nice packaging","I bought these cigars and some bubble gum ones. Everybody loved the chocolate ones...not so much the bubble gum ones. Besides having a nice presentation, people said the chocolate was actually really good!!! I'd buy these over the bubble gum ones again.The only thing I wished was if they gave you more than just 24. Too bad there was not a 'jumbo' pack because these cigars went fast!"
2,Cute costume but.......,"It was a very cute costume. Although it looks more like a wrestler costume, but with a dog costume I didn't expect it to really match what it should look like. The ties were too long for the costume for the size I got. I am gonna assume that all the ties are too long for every size.When I put it on my dog, the arms and body of the costume were too long. Luckily I folded the arms up and sewed it together. The body I could tie in a bow type thing because of the thinness of the fabric.The applicae stuff.....the black around the eyes on the mask, gray stuff on the arms....you catch my drift....came off very easily. From the first time I put in on my dog it crinkled and peeled. I didn't expect much because of the price, but not really like this.I would recommend that if you buy this, to make sure you get the right size and only put in on your dog once because of the peeled of the applicae stuff."
3,breh,"It's okay. Very weird and unintuitive. Two attack buttons, a block button, and a jump button (wtf?).It takes some time to get adjusted to the combat system, but you'll be pleased with what you can do once you overcome that obstacle. Has a good soundtrack with one or two stinkers. One player mode get's old fast once you beat it with all characters, but you can prolly have a blast with a couple of friends and a couple of brews in VS mode.Overall, it's an okay game, recommended for fans of Ranma. Not good like Super Turbo, but not terrible like that other Ranma fighting game that was localized into Street Combat.Get's a C+ from me. Don't pay more than 20 dollars for this game though."
5,The zany anime on my SNES,"The game came quickly, lots of fun, much more forgiving for those who get annihilated on complex fighting games. Very fun!"
4,"good product, poor picture/description","The picture appears to be one piece: it is not. The two piece set is a right side and left side, NOT a middle row seat AND third row seat set. There were no instructions as to fitting the two sections to make them look or function like a one piece mat as pictured (nice camera trick I guess)."
3,FLOOR MATS,THE MATS WORK GREAT. I WISH THE FIT WAS BETTER. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY NEED TO BE TRIMMED. I WAS EXPECTING A PERFECT FIT BECAUSE I LISTED MY TYPE OF VEHICLE. WITH IT LISTING A 2 PACKED RUBBER MAT. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MATS FOR THE 2ND AND 3RD ROW OF MY VEHICLE. IT WAS ONLY FOR THE 2ND ROW AND I HAD TO PIECE THEM TOGTHER.I WAS LOOKING FOR A MAT THAT WENT ACROSS THE ENTIRE VEHICLE. BUT IT WILL DUE.
3,NOT a custom mat,"I was searching for CUSTOM FIT floor mats and this product came up. It is NOT a custom mat. We were purchasing for a 2008 Honda Odyssey with tan interior. Although the mats would fit in the car, they do not fit like the factory mats that came with the car and the tan color is not even close to matching any of the interior of the vehicle.The floor mats themselves appear to be good quality, and if you are looking for rugged floor mats and do not care about them being a perfect fit/color, then I would recommend these mats, but I would probably suggest buying the black ones rather than the tan.But if you are looking for a custom mat that matches your vehicle like the factory mats, then you will be disappointed with these.Also to note, these mats are two individual mats that slightly overlap each other in the second row of said Odyssey and block the floor hatch opening. You are not get a second and third row mat."
2,OK amp,"I boutht this amp for its small size. It was very simple to hook up and does amplify the audio levels fairly well; however, it does introduces more noise into the system then I was hoping for. Also the bypass switch (on/off) doesn't allow the signal to pass through when off, so I can't bypass the amp as expected. I'm checking with Pyramid to see if I got a faulty item or if this is normal operation. I would not buy this item again, but this may be the norm for cheap amps!"
1,Westin Step Bar rusted off at the mounts,"I bought this step bar for my F-150. When I bought it, there was a 5 year warranty on it. It lasted 5 years and 10 months and rusted thru to the point that when I stepped on it to get in my truck, it broke off and fell to the ground. I called Westin customer service and they would not do anything for me on it. I understand that the warranty was up, but I would expect something to last more than 10 months past warranty. I'll never buy Westin again. Poor quality."
1,Needs to be updated.,This video is the most boring video of London I have ever seen. It makes me not want to go to London. Even though it is a DVD the quality of the footage is equal to a quality of the outdated video tapes. It wasn't what I was looking for when I wanted to explore and learn about London.
4,Adventures of a Suburban Mystic,"Amazing story of a very courageous woman. The author colorfully describes her experience with the Hindu Kundalini, which was riviting reading for someone unfamiliar with the energy experience and Hindu beliefs. This book acquainted me with another realm of mystism that until recently I had not explored, and stirred a curiosity to learn more about it. An unexpected twist will prompt the reader to consider a larger plan at work, one that looms an uneasy feeling and questioning ""who's really in charge here"". This is not your typical new age inspirational piece. The author is to be commended for keeping true to herself and having the courage to present her story as it unfolded for her. Very exciting and thought-povoking work. It stirred a multitude of questions within this curious mind."
2,Half-baked,"The title implies that a most worthy concept has found deserving treatment. I, however, found this book to be disappointingly skeletal, spotty, rather facile."
4,Adrift on land,"Winner of a Lambda Literary Award, Barrington's memoir chronicles the years after the deaths of her parents during a cruise ship tragedy. Running from her grief, as well as her emerging desires for women, Barrington travels to Spain to work as a tour guide for a winery. There, she submerges herself in her work and in nightly encounters with various men. It's not until many years pass, that Barrington is able to grapple with her grief and visit her parents' grave in Gibraltar. This autobiography is about the struggle to overcome past tragedies and pain, and to finally embrace the full emotional range of one's self in the journey to wholeness. I was rather enchanted with Barrington's style, yet I felt she didn't delve into the depths as much as the memoir warranted. She does address this in the narrative, where she remarks on how people reacted upon hearing of the deaths of her parents at sea. Everyone does deal with tragedy in different ways, and who's to say which is more appropriate?"
2,Disconnected and frustrating,"The opening chapters, about the author's childhood viewpoint of her parents, and the conflicts prefiguring their at-sea deaths some years later, were engrossing. But the memoir seems disconnected when it then jumps to her young adulthood after her parents' deaths, as she lives a rowdy, promiscuous life in Spain for some years. Somehow this is meant to connect to her guilt about her parents' deaths, but it is unclear, superficial and repetitively tedious. Also, references to issues that seem important to her(e.g., sexual identity) are not followed up. Barrington is a good writer, and I expected a better crafted memoir."
5,works for plants,"I've been using these bulbs on tanks from 5-10g for over a year now. It grows Plants quite well. I use them in my 10g to replace incandescent bulbs. They are long lasting, nice color on the tank and my plants, Shrimp and Fish look great."
3,High Price - Low Quality.,"If you have one of the Marineland aquariums that require this lamp then you have no choice but to buy it. They do not last long and they are very expensive in my opinion. You really have no choice but to buy it if you want a light on your aquarium, so a review is kind of redundant."
2,Poor Fit!!!,"The floor mat comes in two pieces and really does not fit well. The two pieces must over lap a great deal so it looks bad. Also, since they over lap it leaves one side open allowing water to leak out one end onto the carpet of the vehicle. Poor design"
2,Did not fit,These did not fit our ford Transit. They were in two pieces instead of just one like the picture shows. Had to return them.
2,Not as described,The mats came completely different than what we expected. My husband didn't like them so we ended up returning them..
3,"Okay, but pricey","I ordered these for a 2004 Ford F150. The fit is only acceptable. You have to trim the mats to ensure they fit and for the price was not expecting to have to do this. They are relatively thick and of fine quality, they just quite match the truck as expected. The back mat is especially deceptive as it is actually two separate pieces and the middle overlaps. They also do not stay in place very well but that's an issue with all mats so I can't fault the manufacturer for that."
1,CD Stuck in unit,"Originally found the unit to have great sound. But the lack of a dial and very small buttons made it difficult to operate while driving. No custom EQ setting was annoying. I had intermittent problems getting CDs to eject. But now a CD is stuck inside. From reading several forums, it appears that this problem is not uncommon for JVC car audio products."
3,"Gritty, but a cheap price for this stuff","Bought this hoping to save money on a prescription version that costs $28, which I use daily. Can't say for sure whether this one works as well, but it is gritty and not smooth like the other one. I will keep it around in case I run out for a few days, but I won't buy another one."
4,5% benzoyl peroxide,"Business transaction: Received produce thru the mail as expected within 5 business days.Product: Because of the low price, I was concerned the product would be close to expiration, manufactured by some sketchy chinese distributor, or damaged in some way. They are all fine, all came in original packaging... and the expiration is 2010. Happy with the product so far, applies easily, doesnt smell, it hasn't stained my clothes, and cleared everything up after about 3 weeks."
5,Purchased for 2 teenage kids who love the product. Improvements immediately noticeable!,"As long as the price and shipping remain reasonable, we will continue to stock up on a regular continual basis. Percent of active ingredient is just right to clear the skin without excessive dryness issues. Some customers complained of shipping costs, but the times we purchased the shipping was fairly reasonable. Of course FREE be even better. I'm especially happy that this product cleared my son's skin because boys don't have the added option to use make-up to cover blemishes like girls do. So no blemishes, no make-up. His senior portraits came out beautiful! Thanks, I'm glad we found this product."
3,fine!,I mean it came as advertised. I just thought it was a bit weak compared to the brand I usually use. Not bad though.
5,"works well, careful bit drying","Works well to clear up my acne, but of course with it being 5% bp it will dry out your skin. Moisterizers are helpful. Once your skin gets use to this it will adapt. I only use this during my night routine. I think using it twice daily would be too harsh on the skin."
4,"INTRIGUE, SUSPENSE AND JUSTICE","My husband and I both enjoyed reading this book. Having been to the Uncompahgre Plateau several times, and having lived and worked in the same area that the main characters in the book lived and worked, it brought the entire story to life for us. We remember when it happened, although we knew none of the characters in the book. It is very well written, easy to follow, and although detailed about firearms, Mr. Daniels wrote an easy book to read. I highly recommend the book."
5,Very Inspiring!,Full of Great Information and easy to follow! Theologically sound material that prepares the teacher for educating the next generation.
5,Love it!,This is the best smelling essential oil that ive tried so far. I love how the smell lingers in my (and my grandmother's hair) all day long. Everyone loves the smell. I'll definitely be repurchasing.
5,The Origin and the Overcoming of Evil and Suffering in the World Religions (A Discourse of the Worlds Religions),"This is an anthology of a sort; the editor names it ""Discourse of the World Religions."" After the second of five EXPO-Discourses (conferences)held in 2000, this book was compiled to record the nine excellent presentations. It is well-assembled information for readers who are versed in many religions while opening the minds of readers who may not be familiar with any world religions. Questions of evil and suffering have been debated for all of modern human history. This book offers answers to 21st century questioners. The reading level is for advanced high school students,college students plus post-graduates."
3,College,This book was used for an English class focusing on sprawl. It did the job I suppose. I probably wouldn't read it for leisure
2,Misleading,"Bruegmann tries to compare ancient Roman ""sprawl"" and post-WWII developments as the same things simply for their development outside of the city limits. He effectively puts any development in these areas as sprawl without regard for their urban form and pattern.Are streetcar suburbs the same as auto-dependent contemporary developments? Both are outside of the ""city"", but I'd argue they are completely different and not entirely sprawl.Bruegmann also dismisses many alternative viewpoints to his stance (usually in a sentence or so) without going into them in depth substantially. The book also uses some suspect sources that are notoriously biased.The only reason I gave a two-star was for the book's very good source and notations found at the end of the book."
1,A thinly veiled overtly partisan rant,"I appreciate disssenting opinion, however, I do not appreciate when someone tries to present themselves as objective when in fact they are far from it. I would agree with some of the other reviews that indicate that the overall argument is far less than convincing. I would go further to say that at times the authors logic and bent economic egalitarianism is outlandish. I'm sure as a counter argument to outlawing children from 17th century British factories he would posit that the negative result would be increased prices because of a reduction in the cheap labor force. Much of the book is a thinly veiled attack on the left, reformists, academia and anyone who might weigh something other than economics as primary in their decision process."
2,A snoozer for me...,"I put the book aside about 25% of the way through -- a very rare thing for me. It struck me as tedious, repetitive and kind of self-evident. I found myself wondering when I'd get to something compelling, but my interest waned before that happened."
2,"Too ""compact"" for it's own good.","Although this book had some interesting things to say, it was, in general, too ""compact"" for its own good. Bruegmann's arguments against traditional anti-sprawl histories read more like a jedi mind trick than a careful argument. A more careful argument with more supporting facts would have added to the book. As it is, it seems to me that this book will do little to change anyone's view of the 21st century city."
1,Beware of Sprawl Shills,"If you want honesty about half-century of suburban sprawl dominance in the United States, then this book is NOT for you. Once again the truth that academics can be completely out of touch with reality is revealed. To get the full facts about sprawl, especially sprawl culture, sprawl politics and sprawl industry corruption of our political system, then read Sprawl Kills - How Blandburbs Steal Your Time, Health and Money."
5,Even teenagers like it,"It's hard to find games that 16 to 18 year olds will play. Pig Pile has become a household favorite. One of my daughter's boyfriends won't play any other games with us unless we start with his favorite, Pig Pile. I plan on buying one for him to take when he goes to college in the fall. Though the pigs are only used for scoring, they provide entertainment by playing with poses while waiting your turn. The description of play has already been explained by others so I won't go into detail. Suffice it to say, it's great for all ages."
2,Not fun,"The instructions are complicated and I had to read them a few times to get all of the rules. I could maybe see playing this game with a group of adults, but not with children. The ages recommended state 7 and up in one place and in another 12 and up. I disagree, I think most children will lose interest with the cumbersome rules if they even understand them. My suggestion is to do an internet search for the rules before purchasing, read them and if you think it is fun then enjoy! Otherwise another game may be better for you (it certainly isn't good for me)."
1,Hog Crazy!,"Bring in the NASA folks to understand these directions...you got to lay 3 cards here and 4 cards there and hold 6 cards and remember this litany of 'hog washes' and 'ewe turns' and so forth...just no fun--I've read the instructions 10 times--still not getting it...here's a typlical excerpt: '...draw 1 card (unless you do a ewe turn and then you switch hands and turn backward) then proceed counter clockwise starting from youngest to oldest...here is the pile you are trying to get rid of...after everyone has used up all of their cards, the person with no cards left (one having gone out first) can draw 3 pigs, the person going out next (not the winner, the one who went out after the first place person) can draw 2 pigs...'. Anyway--not kidding, there are 200 sets of '( )' in these directions. It's no fun...break out the old maid."
2,Small choice,"A very narrow delve in the great history of gay-aimed dance music, this seems to have been chosen by someone with a penchant for the Record Shack label which produced most of the worst Hi-NRG of the era. Or maybe they just had the cheapest licensing fees. The Carol Jiani and Paul Parker tracks are pretty good, but this doesn't make me want to dance as much as other 80's compilations you can buy. I still say that the best Eurodisco hits are from Europe (especially Italy) and were always better than the Uk or US contenders. At any rate, this is a far too blinkered presentation of what passes for a ""gay classic""."
5,Every dance hit you've ever loved is here!,This CD is a goldmine. Every disco hit you've come to love is on it. Most are long playing versions. Your hips will sway non-stop. My fave: The Boys Come To Town.
3,Not for the kids but downright HILARIOUS!!!,"I saw this oldie in a theater back in the late 70's. No Video or DVD back then. It's a series of classic off-color jokes enacted by a bunch of struggling actors. Some great looking girls, as I recall. The theatre audience would totally erupt at each punchline, it was really a lot of fun. If it was on DVD, I'd most certainly get it, and pass it along to other couples for a few late-night chuckles. But who buys VHS these days?"
4,This kid is the real thang,"I swa Slick about a year ago while writing for the Chicago Music Guide, and I was floored when this guy took the stage. I gave the CD 4 stars because the CD does not reflect how great this guy really is. If you see that he's perforing in your town, go, run to catch his show. I see many performers and you wait for the one's who make you feel as if you just experienced something special. Buy this CD and see his show. This guy will be around for years to come."
5,"Albany Bluesfest, Albany,NY 2006","Everyone who loves the Blues should own this CD! In addition, do yourself a favor and see his show when he's in your area! He had 'em singing,shouting, and dancing all over Albany,NY this past weekend. THE BEST (I never met the young man before-I think Sue's review sounds personal)"
2,Good Groove / Sub-Par Vocals,"Daniel's establishes a groove on most of his songs but it will be a very difficult listing to his CD in the weeks to come. His vocal delivery is lacking and not convening enough to make you stand up and take attention (at least in the way you would want someone to pay attention). It is more of a distraction and takes away from what he is attempting to do.Many guitarists have faced up to the fact of not being great singers and have delegated those duties over to other band members who have those abilities. Hopefully, Slick will come to the realization of this soon and tweak his band configuration.I tend to believe that the other post with the 5-star are friends of Slick and not the general listening public. I recognized too many of the names and know the relationship of them to Slick. But then again, who can blame them. Support the home team.Sue"
5,Soul Shine Blues Festival 09/23/06,"Just got back from the Soul Shine Blues Festival in Bascom, OH. Slick and his band played the final performance and man were they great! He has an awesome voice and he can really play guitar... hard to believe he's only 21. Another prodigy like Derek Trucks!!"
3,"Ooo wee, indeed ...","This is NOT a CD by Walter Hawkins and his family.It is a CD by a southern quartet style group, and it is good for what it is.However, I repeat again that this is NOT a Walter Hawkins CD in any way, shape or form -- regardless of what Amazon has it listed under (and I have submitted a correction form).Even looking at the cover art, I thought it may have been an old pic of the Hawkins family ... like their cousins or something. Artists do that on occasion. Nuh-uh. This is The Hawkins Family all right, but a completely different one than Walter and his crew.And the two music styles are like night and day!Having said that, ""help yourself"" if you like hometown sounding, southern quartet-style gospel. This CD is not what I expected at all ... but maybe this will tell you something: ""Ooh Wee"" is good enough that I have decided to keep it!"
5,Wee Sing Under the Sea,"Wonderful! Educational! We first checked this dvd out to take on a trip to the Oregon Coast for our 7 year old granddaughter. We had hoped it would help pre-teach her how to explore and identify sea life. We combined this fun dvd with other educational books. She loved it! Then we loved it! She watched it 19 times in a week, every spare morning and evening moment, plus in the car. Of course she had every line and lyric memorized. So did we. We had to purchase it! Wee Sing Under the Sea is included in our vacation scrapbook!"
2,Wee sing under the sea,Brought this for granddaughter was disappointed. She loved the old wee sing in sillyville and rock candy mountain. She didn't want to watch this one found this one boring.
2,Wee Sing Under the Sea,"The Wee Sing Series is TOTALLY AWESOME...but my son informs me (in no certain terms...he's 2) that this Wee Sing product is his least favorite. Maybe the songs are not catchy like in Marvelous Musical Mansion or silly like in Sillyville, but his attention frequently wanders when watching Under the Sea."
3,Try other Wee Sings first,"This is the weakest of the Wee Sing canon, and I believe I know why. All of the earlier Wee Sings feature familiar children's songs, while this one has new music written especially for ""Under the Sea."" The songs are okay, but they don't have the appeal of the old favorites we all remember growing up. The ecological message is a little heavy-handed as well, IMHO.The Wee Sing productions are fantastic, and my son still enjoys them even at 10 years old. But if you're new to this series, I would encourage you to start with another title--one of the older releases--to get the true Wee Sing experience."
2,try the other xmen game for snes,"this game is terrible, the graphics are bad, the controls are worse, you cant tell what you can hit and what can hit you...it looks like a bad nes game. its just not worth your time. i only game it two stars bc i do love wolverine and i had expected so much more from this game...why do video game companies always put out bad games for superheros...it makes no sense. only get this game if youre just a huge fan of wolverine and dont care how bad the game is...otherwise i suggest buying the xmen game for the snes...u can be wolverine and its much more fun and the graphics are great. try that one instead"
3,Tile Clippers are good,These Tile Nippers came swiftly and that pleased me much. I used them to create some very creative mosaics in the Pacific Northwest were I hail from and I used them quite a bit. I would consider them a must for any die-hard-mosaic-makers. I sometimes I have use both hands to break the tile as I'm not the strongest one around the block. Must buy!
5,another solid release from Graveworm!,"Graveworm have churned out album after album of the highest caliber. ""Collateral Defect"" is no different. It treads the familiar lines of (N)utopia, but the production in the guitars and keys is much tighter.The ""I need a hero"" cover from Bonnie Tyler is funny at first, but you soon realize that their cover songs are really really good, as long as you have an appreciation for growling that is.Sure Graveworm have changed their song and dance over the years, that's what makes bands great. If they repeated the same sound over and over again, nobody would buy it!They manage a healthy balance between guitars, keys, melodies, and downright brutal vocals. The one thing that made me love Graveworm way back when was the duel death vocals, the ""lower"" and the ""higher"". This variance adds depth to the songs which is then furthered by the melodic and atmoshperic keys.I prefer to rate on a 10 point scale and ""Collateral Defect"" is easily a 9/10!"
1,What a disappointment.,"They did a remake of the song, ""I need a hero"". What more needs to be said?Oh yes, on one track, (I don't remember which, because one listen was all I could take) they even crossed over to the hardcore punk territory.These guys used to be one of my top five, I've got all of their stuff. After this release, they fell right off my list and into the burn pile."
4,"Hondo, Celtic Man In Motion","I had searched for this as a present to my husband for his up-coming birthday. We tried just finding it @ libraries, yard sales, flea markets, etc. for over a year without any sucess. After looking on Amazon....BINGO! How easy THAT was. The book was mailed & received before I even started wondering where in the world could it be. It is a hardback, which was a surprise-Yeah! & in really good condition. This is MY FIRST PURCHASE made by ME directly via Amazon, BUT, it will NOT be my last. Thank you for having quality items & an easy, safe, reliable way to purchase ""hard to find"" items."
2,This CD only has some grooves and a few good songs!,"I only love the songs BYOU, WHO LET THE DOGS OUT, MOVE IT LIKE THIS,and Y,M,C,A. And to everyone who ever said it was outstanding what kind of CD are you listening to. Unless if you only like the songs I listed then go you, go you, go you.stephanie Boalan honest musical reviewer telling you what you need to know about music and only what you need to know about music!"
4,Rather Surprised,"Ok, first off during Australian Idol 3 I couldnt stand Lee Harding so am defiantely not a fan BUT I must admit his first outing is rather good. Vocally he is never going to be the best around but he has had a great song written for him (Wasabi)and he pulls it off really well. Eye of the Tiger he always did well even live. If you are into pop/punk then give him a go, you will probably be pleasantly surprised."
5,Music for the whole family,"Whether you are three years old or eighty you will find yourself first tapping your toes then clapping your hands and finally dancing with a big grin on your face while listening to this c.d.It is rollicking and unpretentious, and sings about everyday things that all ages but especially children will easily identify with."
5,Happy purchase,"We make a little music ""just for fun"" in our house, and Ablum is a welcome adddition. The 4-year-old can be a little resistant to new music--he knows what he likes and likes what he knows--but he was requesting his favorite tracks the first day."
3,Belize and Guatemala - Legacy of the Maya,"I should have read the title more carefully. I was hoping the film would be about the ancient Maya, but it is about modern day Maya, which I can see now by the subtitle. I probably should give it more than 3 stars since, if one is looking for information about Maya descendants, this documentary is fairly well done: good photography, and it is accurate according to information I have come across during my research of Maya history, and also while on a tour of Maya ruins at sites in Belize and Guatemala. But you won't find much archaeology in this film."
5,"Monster Hunter 2. Extreme fun, and challenge.","MH2 is a very fun game. Different from most RPG's because there are nolevel up's, but in it's unique way still a lot of fun. From game-play,sound, graphics, and cinemas; all top notch for the PSP. The onlyother thing to mention is the factor of skill required. In the beginingand middle of the game, the challenge is moderate, allthough latertowards the end it becomes VERY hard.All factors included, the game is awesome, though a little difficult."
1,Bad value,Bought this for my grandson. Was very dissapointed when my daughter called and said he already had that one. Turns out she bought the same one at Walmart for $10. Returned and am still waitng for refund. Buyers Beware
3,Heavy Handle,"The vacuum works well, but the handle is heavy, thus it's harder to push around than my last Bissell vacuum."
2,A little disappointing,"The belt broke the first day! I'm still waiting for customer service to send me a new one, although they said that's not a warranted part. Understandably, but I wouldn't expect something to break on the first day! Also, it's almost too light because it falls over so easily. When using the attachments, you have to make sure not to pull on the hose as the machine will easily fall over on you."
1,performance is poor over time - pet hair,"This vacuum performed well when I first purchased it and for a few months thereafter. Unfortunately though, I have two cats and even with regular emptying, the cat fur now accumulates way up inside the clear plastic. Every two weeks, I have to stick a butter knife way up inside the vacuum and scrape the cat fur off the thing that seems to produce the suction. Because of the design, it is not easy to get the fur off the suction thing. Sorry I'm not using better technical terms. The point is that if you have pets, this vacuum will eventually lose suction. I'm now in the market for a bagged canister vacuum as I want a minimal-maintenance vacuum. Getting on the floor with a butter knife every two weeks just isn't working for me."
4,"Great vac,","I wont reiterate what others have said, but I will say:1. I vacuumed a rug with my Hoover Windtunnel until the green light came on and I could not see anymore dog/cat hair, and then I vacuumed with the Bissell. Much to my surprise, the Bissell picked up even more pet hair and dirt! I never believed the hype, but it did what many have said it would.2. For those worried about the wheels scratching their wood floors, I had a spare belt from my Hoover Windtunnel laying around and I thought it just might fit onto the wheel on the Bissell, so I tried it. Sure enough it fit perfectly, so I went out and bought a second one. The large rear wheels on my Bissell are now scratch proof. :-) Now I have to work on something for the small wheels under the vacuum.I gave it four stars because I broke a belt the first time I used the vacuum when a long thread of a carpet got wrapped up onto the brush. I stopped the vac. in plenty of time, but the belt had already snapped, it seems kind of weak."
1,Maybe I got a lemon....,"I bought this for our cabin. We have both carpet and bare floors and two dogs. Initially, it seemed like it was doing a great job. Within a week I noticed that it wasn't picking up on the bare floors and it was leaving little piles of hair and dirt that it spit out the sides. I frequently changed the collection container, washed out the filter and turned it over to make sure nothing was stuck. Alas, it's just a piece of junk!"
4,Vacumn happy,"Very pleased with function of this Vacumn. I read every review I could before I purchased, went to retail stores to compare the only negative thing I agree with is that is a little hard to manuever,(it is heavy, thus 4 stars) but all the positive things outweigh that. We have 2 cats & I never felt my previous vacumn was getting things clean. Amazon's price and quick delivery is the best and I have purchased many,many things thru them."
2,Major disappointment,"I bought this after reading all the great reviews on the vacuum. I couldn't wait to see what this highly rated item would do to my carpets and floors. However, I was in for a mighty disappointment. I could never get the green airflow indicator to show more than a teeny tiny bit. Could have been shyness but it was very frustrating. I called Bissell and after some discussion and experiments (including taking all sorts of pipes off that were really difficult to get back on) we decided that the vacuum was faulty. I am now waiting for my replacement hoping that this one is more confident and less deficient in sucking power."
1,A Real Piece of Junk !,"Received this item, opened the box, tried to assemble the parts and one of the wheels immediately fell off the vacuum ! The wheel would not stay fixed to the body.The vacuum is very poorly made with lots of cheap plastic parts.Not a bargain at any price ..A real piece of junk ."
1,Broke the 3rd time I used it!,The 3rd time I used this machine the plastic clip that holds the brush in place broke and then spit out ground up plastic all over the carpet. Unfortunately I couldn't vacuum this up because the vacuum no longer worked.It has now been in the repair shop for longer than I had it in my home.It was my 2st experience with a Bissell and will certainly be my very last!!!
2,UPDATE:till now working good,"Reasonable good, pretty comfortable. Since I have it only for few weeks, do not know about the reliability.UPDATE: After 2 years of usage this vac started to work poorly and after 2,5 years it died and thrown to garbage."
1,brush belt melt down after not more than ten time uses,"I bought it a few months ago and after not more than ten times uses (just for vacuum a regular size house), the brush belt melt down. I opened the bottom cover and found out it is very hot around the belt area and the motor axis is extremely hot. It was used in the CA ocean side area; the environment temperature is not high. So it means the design of this product has serious problem. Just image how many belt you have to replace it if it keep melting out in this kind of speed?). My old vacuum cleaner still works without any maintenance so far after nearly 10 year use."
2,bissell 3990,"sweeper arrived quickly & somewhat easy to put together. worked well for several months, clogged up a few times and unfortunately swept up loose edge of rug & beater bar belt broke, replaced belt w/non-manufacturer belt & have had problems since; smell of burning rubber & now beater will not roll on carpeting. does not work as well on bare wood floors as i had hoped. overall, below average in my book."
5,Works for me,"I have been very satisfied with mine. It was easy to assemble; I put it together and before I knew it, I had vacuumed the entire house. I couldn't put it away. The container where the dirt goes couldn't be any more convenient or simple to use. The hose connection works great as well and all of the utensils are readily available on the unit."
5,Great vacuum at a good price,"I have purcahsed this vacuum a few months ago and love it.I was amazed at the amount of junk it sucked up that our other vacuum missed. I vacuumed with the old vacuum, then this back to back. The stuff it still pulled up boggled my mind. Our carpet looks great after vacuuming, and it sucks up all the little bits of litter the cat kicks out, lol.I do not have any stairs, so I cannot comment on its weight or lugging it up and down stairs..."
5,Wonderful vaccum cleaner,"As other folks have mentioned, this vacuum cleaner is a little loud. It does a great job picking up the dirt, and I the brush attachment is the best I've ever had."
1,Don't buy over the internet!!,"Trust the negative reviews, the vacuum came broken to my door. They do not pack it in anything other than what you would grab it off the shelf at walmart. No stirofoam or any protectant. The side of the box got smooshed and so did the vacuum. Whole bottom left side was broken off. Amazon is good to take it back however it takes up to 4 weeks to get your money back. What am I going to do until them with no good vacuum? Trust me, I decided to chance it, I recommend if you want this vacuum, get it at the store, even if you have to pay more."
2,Buy something else,I have had this vacuum for well over two years now. I did my research and decided on this one. My #1 complaint and reason for its dislike is the tip over hazard it has. When using the hose attachment the vacuum will fall toward you. This happens almost each time I use the hose. I have gotten cracked before and it hurts.My suggestion....find another vacuum cleaner without the tip over hazard.
2,2nd one hieght adjustment broke!,"This is our 2nd Bissell turbo upright.Both of them ended up having the hieght adjustment knob detent spring strip.You can't adjust the hieght on thevvaccum,its stuck at one hieght.I feel it wasn't due to heavy handed use,but a cheap,bad design.Its a nice vaccuum,but watch out with the hieght adjustment."
4,OK the second time around,"The first vacuum shipped to us arrived damaged, but it was replaced quickly. This vacuum has a lot of useful features without being too heavy. Only problem is that the main hose has a weak connection to the main vacuum canister so you end up just getting a lot of dust in the air."
2,Disappointed,"I have an old Bissell Clearview vacuum that didn't have the power I needed or the ability to turn off the brush on hard floors so I ordered this vacuum as soon as it came out. The first one was damaged in shipping and smoked/smelled when I tried to use it. Amazon sent a replacement out quickly, but the second vacuum smoked like the first one. The belt had been put on wrong and snapped within five minutes. Bissell sent out a new belt but the burning plastic odor didn't go away. It does pick up dirt/dog hair better than the Clearview, but the Clearview is still used on days I can't put up with the odor. The instructions to put the belt on are not clear so you might want to check out the configuration before it breaks so you will know how to put on the new one. Very disappointed as I have liked other Bissell floor products."
1,Piece of JUNK!!!,"I ignored the negative reviews and focused on hte positive ones because I liked the price and wanted to believe Bissell was a good name. Never again. My husband has had to take the thing apart pretty much every other week. There is always some issue, and always with different parts. I noticed a horrible burning odor while using it, and after much investigation, we noticed the brush was not rotating. My rug is very low pile and I had the setting on four, the brush didn't budge. I had to put it up to six for the brush to spin, and at six, it's too high off the floor to fluff up the carpet, so it looks very matted and dull and the vacuum fails to pick up smaller debris and hair. Bissell customer service is extremely not helpful with the whole situation. Next time I'll spend the extra money and get a Dyson!"
3,"Works fine, controls are kinda lame, get this if you have wood floors","Had mine a couple months now. It really does suck stuff up pretty well and I haven't had any complaints about emptying it. If you have tile and hardwood, this is the Bissell to get. The others in t 39XX range are not as well designed for the variety floors.So my complaints:I wish the on/off switch were on the handle.The hose gets in the way of winding the powercordIt feels top-heavy compared to my old kenmoreI wish the edges stuck out to the sides a little more so i could clean under the kickboard of my cabinets without using the hosebut it's ok... really. I'd buy another for how cheap they are."
5,works great,I love this vacuum cleaner. It picks up everything and cleans all floors. I have mostly hard wood floors and a few rooms with carpet. It is easy to switch the rollers off and on and cleans all my floors. I would recommend this product!
1,wrong product !!,"Although I ordered a ""model # 3611, 3-burner set"" from Amazon.com, what I received was a 2-burner set, incorrectly labelled as being a ""model # 3611"". I then went down to my local Weber dealer and bought their ""model # 3611"" burner set, which indeed was the 3-burner set it was supposed to be. For what it's worth, I paid LESS at my local store than I did for the Amazon.com version."
4,Great Costume,My daughter loves dragons and there was no disappointment with this one. It was well designed and appears to be extremely durable. We were really impressed with this product. Our daughter still uses it for play - we may have this for next year as well. I highly recommend this costume if your kid wants to be a dragon - for Halloween or anytime.
2,too slow for some,The advanced player will find himself bored with this quite fast. The tempos are too slow and the rhythm section too monotonous to play anything interesting.
5,Wonderful book,"I bought this book from Amazon, and I loved this book, it testifies to the primitive Christian healing we long for... Any person of any faith or no faith can read and understand it, and be inspired and benefited. I've known many people who have also had these kinds of healing experiences that come from the original book that Mary Baker Eddy wrote ( Science and Health). Great book, indeed, I loved the book."
5,Cant believe I bought this shirt LOL,"I can not STAND this movie.. But my 14 year old son loves it.. Napoleon is an idol to him I think sometimes LOL. So when he gets this for Christmas I am sure he will love it.. Size is right on, and it arrived quickly.."
2,What do you expect,Not the greatest shirt but the price was right. One critique is the neck hole is extremely small either that or I have a huge neck.
4,Already retro!,"I bought this for my friend Peter. It was only available in a Large size, and in black, but it was a dollar! The shipping stayed the same when I ordered more shirts, so I got four. Now, Pete and I and our spouses can strut about looking like complete plonkers, but happy with our bargain tees."
2,I don't like it!!,"Every Passover I get this CD out and try to play it. Try is the key word here, everyone laughs over the version of Dayenu. I guess I just like something more traditional. If you like strange versions that aren't very good, okay. Otherwise keep shopping, I am!!"
2,Not what I expected,"I was disappointed with this book. I have seen it described as ""Historical and mythological customs, lore, and traditions associated with the eight Pagan holidays"" so when it was recommended to me I bought it. I found it utterly useless in adding anything to my rituals. There were no real, solid ideas I could use to help me celebrate the Sabbats. For what it is it may be an alright book, but if you are looking for a book to give you ideas for what you can do, present day, to celebrate the Sabbats this is NOT it."
5,Review of The Witches' Sabbats,"This book is the work of a scholor that had done extensive work in the Pagan/Wiccan field. Mike is an authority on the Celtic myths as well as the workings of the present day movement.This book came out of a series of papers he wrote on each of the Sabbats. I had copies of these papers and I am now very happy that they have been published, along with other articles, so that the general public has a chance to read them.This is one of the musts for the Pagan/Wiccan for reference in your libraries."
5,Great book,"Mike Nichols is one of my favorite authors. This is another one of his well written, very information books."
2,Factual but Boring,"Nice book, not very intriguing, at times read like an almanac. Good for Carolina facts"
1,not a very welcoming book,"when i was reading this book it was very territorial. god forbid a ""yankee"" or whatever you call it comes and moves down to north carolina. or if your having a bad day and your new to the community, you need to let the community know so that they know to stay away from you. this book is worthless. my advice dont live near the author cause hes going to be in your business"
3,The Good Wife (could be better),"Set in 1939 in Australia, a woman (Rachel Ward) is mostly happily married to a good provider, but is bored in bed. She falls for a local bartender (Sam Neill), who seems to be the Lothario type. But when she literally throws herself at him, he tosses her away. Her doggedly faithful husband takes her back. The potential for something really excellent is here, but nothing comes of it. The characters are too zombie-like to prompt us very much to care about them."
2,The Good Wife=bad,"I dont see how this movie got anything over 2 stars. It was just plain odd. The phsycho wife sleeps with her husbands goofy, childish brother because ""one man is like any other"" in her opinion. It is obvious that the husband (the only character that I cared even a little about)is hurt by her willingness to sleep with his brother but says OK because its what his wife wants. Then, the wife see's Sam Niell, whom I could not find one thing attractive about, and becomes obsessed with him to the point where she leaves her home and faithful, ever patient husband, and moves into town to stalk this bartenders every move 24 hours a day from across the street. The ending was almost fitting, I just wish the train had run over her and that her husband would move on to a woman who deserved him."
5,just as described,The product is just as described. Works like a charmwould order it again in a minute
1,VERY out of date information--stay away,"In August 2007, I bought this book for my honeymoon in Vancouver Island. We hiked two of the hikes listed. One was completely impossible to locate based on the details given: completely incorrect street names (three incorrect street names). We ended up asking at a gas station and were given new street names to locate trailhead and different directions. The other hike was badly misrepresented, with trail names marked differently than the book indicated. A guidebook should guide the hiker; I personally think the author and publisher should be embarrassed to sell this title."
3,Disappointing,"I've been running since 1980 and have always bought Asics shoes since 81. I have been using the GT models for a long time. But since visiting a sporting goods store, and was informed that the Nimbus VII would be a good shoe for my high arches. I bought them. They were great I ran in them for several months. All thought the winter of 2006. So when the version VIII's came out i went right down and bought them for $119.I was disappointed. After just a few weeks of using them there seemed to be no cushioning left in them. The fit just wasn't the same.Since then i have switched back to the GT's. Getting the GT2120's proved to be disappointing also. They seem very flat and no cushioning in the forefoot."
4,Good preparatory tool for test...not enough though,"This book is an excellent reference book for the MCP Exam (152) over Interdev and Web Technologies through Microsoft. Unfortunately, it only covers about 70% of what is on the exam...good news is that it is the best study guide out there I have found as of Aug '99."
5,Excellent book! A MUST for web developers!,"I'm about half-way through this book, and can't put it down. The author writes in casual and easy to grasp language. The example he uses throughout the book is a real-world business example. Since the first chapter, I've learned something new and useful with every chapter, from browser choices for my target audience, to databases for the backend. The subject material is great for the programmer who is just getting into web applications, and those already doing it. If you develop or want to develop web applications, this book is a MUST HAVE!"
3,Not really about InterDev,"It is a very readable book. Going into a lot of concepts of working with existing architecture. I was expecting a deeper dealing with InterDev and was disapointed. It's not about how to use the program, more about what the program can be used for and strategies for doing that. If you want detail on the program itself, wait to get this later."
3,Pretty good book but .....,"The book is pretty good but heavily weighted to the Visual Basic programmer, the author makes no apologies for that and VB IS a good rad tool. However, there are a lot of us Visual C++ programmers that are looking at using Interdev too. The author seems to ignore VC++ until he wats to use the VC++ Source Code Editor in Chapter 11. (At our location, we have VB programmers in house for the VB code.) I like the book, I just wish authors would stop relying on VB because of it's ""ease of use"". I would recommend the book to people who are new to the Visual Studio 6 and VB programmers but I'm still looking for a book that covers the enterprise level development tools well."
3,"best found, but far off topic","So this is the best book I found on Visual Interdev. It has only a couple chapters on it and doesn't try to explain the accompanying JScript library in it...The rest is about the usual enterprise stuff (in the MS View). There are quite a few books to that topic, most other ones do roughly as well.So my wish to a potential author: write about VI and only about VI and try to do it as well as you can. Don't spend more than 1 or 2 chapters on other topics. Thanks in advance."
2,No VI6 book,This book is not about Visual InterDev 6 - VI6 is used only for examples. If you need information about VI6 buy another book.
4,"Good Book, Buy It","Fantastic book, covers most every aspect of enterprise development related to Visual InterDev. My only complaint is that, for no readily apparent reason, the authors insert a page or several of code. In the first six chapters I found myself skipping pages upon pages of code that was inserted, in my opinion, with no purpose. At the point of insert the author was talking in generalities and the page(s) of code added nothing to the discussion. Later in the book, when the authors are being more specific, the code inserts are appreciated. Other than that nit, which simply results in a book that is 20-30 pages larger than it needed to be, I found the book to be a great resource."
2,Not About Visual InterDev 6.0,"This book has alot of good information however, very little of it has anything to do with Visual InterDev. Yes the book does use Visual InterDev at time to show examples when using Microsoft Transaction Server or Queue Server but not about the many uses of VI."
1,"Skims enterprise development and VI 6.0, very introductory.","This book should be renamed ""Introduction to enterprise development concepts"". The author mentions various enterprise development issues in passing paragraphs, and assumes that the reader is a beginner just getting into application development. The sample application is mentioned, but code for the application is barely covered. It is assumed that the reader will install the CD and read the code to figure it out. When code is shown, it seems like it was purposely double-spaced to fill more pages.Visual Interdev is not covered deeply. An entire paragraph to skim the features of VI6.0 is a waste of paper. It is no better than the online documentation that comes with the Microsoft CD. I was looking to understand visual interdev and to tie it my databases, and bought this book based on other reader's comments, but was disappointed. I will return it since it does not meet my needs."
3,Not bad -- for the youngest audience,"My 4 year old and 7 year old love this movie. They don't watch it over and over like some other Disney movies, but they do enjoy the music. My little girl likes the talking bears and thinks that is really weird/cool. My son, the budding musician, loves the scenes with electric guitars. No, the plot is not original and the bears are not cute at all, but my kids enjoy it and frankly, that is the important thing. I wouldn't choose to watch this movie, or most family Disney movies, unless I was accompanied by my children. (Although I did get a kick out of Christopher Walkin, especially in the scence where he is an ""arm musician"".) I think that it is an appropriate, fun movie for younger kids, but bigger kids might be unimpressed."
4,My son loves this movie.,"My 2 1/2-year-old loves this movie--will watch it over and over again. The songs are catchy and the movie is cute. My 5-year-old has gotten a little bored with it, but liked it the first few times he watched it. My son lost the movie so we are back on Amazon looking to get another--it is a must have in our home."
3,Attention -- Mr. Peter Hastings (I know YOU will see this)..,"Why was ""The Country Bears"" released only in a fullscreen version? Why didn't you release this movie in a widescreen (letterbox) version?? Even though the soundtrack was FAR superior to the picture (I liked the picture too, don't be mistaken - I loved the ST) The movie deserved to be released in it's original theatrical version. Things were left out (Missed the Dave Mason poster to Henry's left in Henry's office - The KFI radio billboard as the bus was going into the Toluca Lake Car Wash (On Magnolia @ Cahuenga Bl in N. Hollywood)..etc). I think I can speak for Bear fans EVERYWHERE - Including my buddy Paul Barrie Jr. of ""The Country Bears Playhouse"" - Peter Hastings needs to re-release this movie in the future in widescreen under ""Special - Peter Hastings Director's Choice"" I would be a happy Grizzly!! JG"
4,The Country Bears,"Excellent laid back family movie, appealing to both adults & children alike. A toe tapping road trip where the value of friendship & family are explored to the tried & true Disney formula where kids can get lost in the fantasy & adults can play spot the celebrity 'special guest' all culminating in the usual happy ending."
2,"""COUNTRY BEARS"" SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN HIBERNATION!","This film was so boring that the 9 year old I was with wanted to leave half way through! Other kids in the theatre were just as antsy. The jokes could have been featured on a ""Barney"" episode and the musical numbers, of which there were far too many, were yawners. If you want a great ""G"" movie today, go see ""Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron""."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I hated it--I almost fell asleep! I found myself writing stories in my head just waiting for it to be over! As a little kid I loved the show at Disney World but this movie ruined it for me. I guess toddlers and stuff might like it but for pre-teens, well, let's just say it's not my style."
1,ONE WORD - STUPID,"I saw this movie back when I was in 4th grade and as soon as I found out we were gonna be watching this as a ""Treat"", I dreaded coming to school that day. The movie didn't surprise me, it was STUPID, NOT FUNNY, and I almost FELL ASLEEP. DO NOT BUY THIS, unless you like anthropormorphic bears singing cheesy songs about friendship."
4,Much better than expected,"I went to this movie not knowing what to expect,not seeing any reviews on it at the time. Reminded me in a way of the muppets where creatures intermingle as if an everyday occurance. Christopher Walken is in a wierd comedic role,(still a psycho though). The hassels the group goes through trying to get back together are sometimes dumb but,hey,what do you want from a Disney movie? I've seen much worse! All I can say is if you think you might want to watch it?,do it! I've learned to be my own critic,never listen to other people. Everybody,s taste is different. Personally, I saw it twice."
1,A lot to pay for nothing,"My mother and I went to see this in the theater and after about a half hour of watching patchy ""music videos"" through this movie, we left. That is exactly what this movie was. The plot was thin and the only reason this movie got made was to push this bubble gum pop rock down our throats. What would have been wrong with keeping the Bears the way they used to be and playing bluegrass instead of this bile they were forcing down our throats. If I wanted to listen to pre-pubescent Britney wannabes sing with animals, I'd have just gone home and turned on MTv. Don't waste your time"
5,Bear Video,"This is a super cute movie;It went to the grandchildren who live out of the country. They were thrilled. Thanks, Amazon"
1,Desappointed,"Movie will not work on any DVD player, it says it is from another country. This is unexceptable, how disappointing. And the worst of it is I have to pay postage to return the movie. I will not be ordering from them again."
1,Stupid,"This movie is just dumb all around.It's funny that this is called The ""Country"" Bears,seeing as though,that there is not even a single ""Country"" artist in this film.Except for maybe Willie Nelson at the end credits,but other than that,I noticed NO other country music artists in here.What the hell is Elton John,Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley making cameos in a film that is called The ""Country"" Bears?? We should have seen apperances by some country singers.Not from rock/pop artists.If you are expecting this film to have a country music theme to it,then look elsewhere.The title is totally misleading."
1,Cheated!,I ORDERED TWO (2) SHOOTER SLEEVES AND ONLY RECEIVED ONE (1)! I EMAILED THE CONTACT OF THE BUSINESS AND HAVE YET TO GET A RESPONSE! WHERE'S THE BBB WHEN YOU NEED THEM?
5,Polish Remover,This polish remover does the job and without irritation to the nails or surroundingskin. Great stuff!
5,Stainless Steel is Best,Stainless steel burners are the best. They last very long and keep the heat level constant. My WEBER will last forever
2,Not the best Stainless,I purchased this about a year and about a year later it had hot and cold spots over the grill. I had to clean rust out that plugged holes that the gas is suppose to come out of. The first one lasted many years and never plugged. What kind of stainless rusts? This kind! Probably comes from China.Weber 3609 Stainless-Steel Burner Tube Set
4,excellent product,The first set of burners lasted for 8 years so for little money I've got a new grill well worth the money. Only problem was removing one of the old screws tha hold the burners in. Other than that it went back together in a snap.
2,Not what you see,"I did not get the crossover tube in the box like the picture shows. I had do modify one of the tubes so it would work with my old crossover. Go to weber in the future to get what you need , its worth the extra money."
1,Poor fit,"These mats didn't fit my vehicle at ALL! Very upset. Total waste of my time and money. The mats are nice and would have worked great, but they weren't even close to fitting my vehicle correctly. Why bother putting the matching system on the sales page if it doesn't work? Unfortunately, I was travelling and missed my deadline for returning them, so now I'm stuck with these mats that don't fit, and I can't sell it back because they don't allow that. Oh, and the dealership sells the fitted ones for the same price. Go there first!!!"
2,Beware universal fit,These aren't custom fit mats! You must cut them to fit your application. I would gladly pay more for a better fitting mat.
1,Parallax View of the Classroom,"The author's case for constructivism is predicated on unrealistic notions not only concerning the realities of education, but also the fundamentals of social diversity. The book seems to take the view that the more radical a notion is the more bookworthy it becomes. This concept is promoted by outlandish recommendations that clearly could not be practically implemented ... or even reasonable to consider. The author does not provide empirical evidence to support his opinion. The author seems to rely on a self-aggrandizing style to entrap other educators who may embrace his liberal ideas more as a defense against being labeled the traditionalist villian in this fictional work. Any educator who embraces this book has a parallax view of the classroom ... one that is upside down and inside out. In that case, the problem is not the classroom, but the teacher."
2,"Educators, Read This Book Carefully","If you are considering the constructivist approach to teaching this book is probably as good as any others that address this topic. Brooks and Brooks present constructivism as an interesting array of excellent teaching methods. It is what I would call discovery learning, reminiscent of the 1980's. In other works the authors reveal the defining quality of constructivm and their postmodern philosophy more clearly by denying that there is any real truth for children to discover or learn. If you are a person of faith, I am asking you to think very seriously before you adopt a constructivist approach to teaching, and participate in its hidden curriculum: There is no truth. Can you teach as effectively, or more effectively as a discovery teacher? Pray, ask God to guide your teaching as you work with the greatest gift to us all--the children."
1,Book for course,"This book I used for my college course, it was a good and informative book. I use it as a reference."
2,Not really SciFi,"The only sci-fi element is an unexplained device that can shut down airplane motors in mid flight. It's somewhat entertaining from a late 30's, second-feature on a Tuesday night, type of movie. If it was a TV show today, it would be a second-tier dramady on Spike. The ""classic sci-fi"", ""sci-fi"", and ""fantasy"" tags should be removed. The ""disaster films"" tag should stay even though it doesn't fit the genre. I'm sure you'll know why once you've watched it. Enjoy."
3,Not as complete as I wanted,"While this book shows many hardanger stitches, the directions are wanting with regard to detail. I think if a person had more experience with this type of embroidery it would be more helpful.That being said, after I have some experience under my belt, this book should still prove to be a great addition to my library.Good reference book for the more experienced."
1,Boring!,"This book is very basic, uninspiring and not what I would expect from a reputable company like anchor. Puts me off buying others in the range"
3,Luigi 21 inch plush doll,"Ugh, this is still not the correct size doll as this one is just too huge, but at least it's bigger than the 12"" Mario doll my other son has and I can stop buying these dolls.As with the other 12 inch Luigi doll, this doll has iron-on eyes, ""L"" and yellow buttons, which I detest as they rub off/chip/peel. I'm also not sure why they didn't tack down the sideburns, but they stick up and look like wings.This Luigi doll sort of looks like Luigi, but not really. Any kid who is a serious Mario & Luigi fan, as both mine are, will point out various differences in appearance. Nevertheless, it's a cute doll and my son likes it, but he noticed the dissimilarity to his favorite character immediately.My search for a matching Luigi plush doll is now over. Whew."
3,Cheap looking Luigi,"I bought this Luigi doll for my nephew and it has a 'cheap' look to it. He was thrilled, but the adults could tell it seemed poorly made. The sideburns are held down with one yarn and seem to want to come up. His body seems to be a bit disproportionate.It was much cheaper than other Luigi dolls, so I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Essential...for the time being.,"As an avid Bronson fan I've been looking forward to a book like this one for the longest time. This particular book has been under way for quite a while, having been postponed several times. Now it's finally here, and the result is so-so. Since Bronson apparently has stopped acting now, it's nice to have a complete overlook of all his work. However, what disappoints me a bit is how little Pitts talks about each movie. -There's lots more to be said about these films, many of them classics, but what you get here is all one is allowed to expect from a reference book, I guess. (-Although McFarland have produced similar books on actors with more thorough discussions, like the brilliant one about Peter Cushing's movies.) Also, and it may just be my copy of the book, but the photos seem to be reproduced not dark enough. Despite these shortcomings it's still a sure-buy for fans, but the ultimate fact-filled book on the films of Mr. Bronson is yet to be written."
4,"Enjoyable, but a tad disturbing at times","My son enjoys this book and CD set. I really enjoy some of the stories, as well as the narrator's enthralling renditions. However some of the stories are a bit violent for my tastes."
2,Rehashes well-known tales,"How sad was I to find that several of these stories are rehashes, or just Irish versions, of stories found in other cultures, like Cinderella. No kid needs another version of that tired yarn! I wanted fresh, interesting tales that would entertain me and my kid at storytime. Unlike the other Barefoot Books I own, this volume is dull in color and the illustrations, though attractive, are not kid-friendly. In the soul-cages, the richness of the descriptions are not mined by the illustrator, who might be more at home designing corporate clipart. SO disappointed. The poetry book I bought from Barefoot is so lush and full of such unusual poems that I show it to friends who come over!"
3,If you don't think taking the Lord's name in vain is a sin....,"I love the pictures and a few of the stories. But I did not like the blasphemy. We feel strongly about our beliefs and this is not something I want to read to my child. I feel it is inappropriate especially in a children's book. I would not have purchased it had I known. The stories in this book are pretty scary for younger children. In one story a mother is thought to have eaten her babies when in fact the mother in law threw them out the window to the wolves. Then the mother in law smears blood on the sleeping mother's face to make the idea of her eating them real. Then the mother is almost burned at the stake, saved, and then the mother in law is burned at the stake. Not a happy bedtime story. My three year old loves most of the pictures, but doesn't ever ask to read it! Beware if you are buying this for younger children. I would not purchase this book again."
1,like i said.....bad,this game is uummmm......bad. no story to start off or nothin. they could at least they could tell you how to play. haha no wonder it was soooo cheap. if i had a time travel gadget i would go back in time and knock myself out before i bought it again.lol
1,Doesn't work as advertised.,In the description it says it can reach a distance of 200 ft. in the open field. I find this hard to believe especially since the instruction papers shipped with the item only claim it can cover 30 ft. That might even be an overstatement though. The only way I see this thing working is if you plug it into an ipod and set that ipod directly onto whatever receiver you're hoping to capture the signal from.
4,A STORY OF GOOD AND EVIL,2005. Written and directed by Anders Thomas Jensen. Three Danish Film Academy awards and unnumerable other awards throughout the world. A skinhead must spend three months in the company of an enlightened reverend. Carl Theodor Dreyer revisited. Give it a chance.
3,Adam's Apples DVD Review,"It seems to be a given that dvd's of Danish films will be pathologically telecined. As nearly as I can make out, a PAL 25fps dvd has been re-encoded to 29.97 by dropping and cloning frames, and the result is not very nice. When will the folks that master dvd's get a clue that they can simply s-l-o-w d-o-w-n most PAL dvd's from to 24fps (24000/10001) and get a perfect NTSC film format dvd? In most cases the PAL dvd was mastered by speeding up a 24fps source. Sigh."
4,Sureal Black Comedy,"Mads Mikkelsen is a quirky great actor. As a priest or pastor he shares the lead role in this movie with Ulrich Thomsen playing a hardened skinhead, but starred in VALHALLA RISING where he was a phenomenon. This film is almost a Bosch painting in it's modern way. The acting is solid all around, competent direction and filming, and plot and structure move everything right along. Each character is a minor masterpiece in themselves. Although it's a comedy, its not. This movie is weird, yes, but don't go bashing it or god will get you. See it!"
4,worth the wade through the words,"In very academic prose, Cook manages to make the case for his provacatives views. He finds in the history of the children's clothing industry in the US from 1917-1962, a growing ethos to see the world from the ""child's point of view"" (something he awkwardly calls ""pediocularity""). In painstaking detail in some places, Cook shows how the growing clothing industry increasingly shaped the fixtures, floor plans and overall design of children's stores to be oriented to kids' viewpoints rather than the mothers'. One result, he claims, is that children have gained the status of persons in our culture because their ""needs"" and desires are catered to, not just by the clothing industry, but by all parts of our culture--often even over adults. Among the interesting cases are: how the ""toddler"" was invented by industry and the ""preteen"" girl in the 1950s as the forerunner of today's ""tween."" If you are into this sort of reading, it pays off well."
5,Great recipes,"I bought this cook book as a souvenir of a New England vacation. It's one of the most useful cookbooks I've ever had! In the month that I've had it, I've made 6 recipes, and they have all been big hits. This is just simple home cooking, basic recipes, ingredients usually found in a home. The directions are well written. These are real people recipes."
1,Children of the Rainbow,"It is so sad that this book has drawn so many people down a path so far from truth. The fact is that ancient Hawaiian religion has no resemblance to Christianity what-so-ever. Just as in the case of Native American peoples on the mainland, wannabe's have twisted the ancient beliefs to what they want them to be in order to profit from them. The so called religion that this book touts never was. It's a shame that the wonderful stories from the past have been so sadly represented. The Hawaiian people deserve better. This book is a waste of time as anyone that has actually studied ancient Hawaii can tell you."
4,NBA JAMS are the best on SNES.,"This sequel to the first NBA JAM was a huge upgrade. More players to choose from, player substitutes, more modes, new dunks... I have nothing bad to say about this game.. but there is just one thing I wish it had have had from the first game... and thats the breaking of the backboard. It was so much fun to try to be the first to smash that backboard in the first game.Still, I cant say wether this game is the better of the NBA Jam games or not, but the SNES defintly produced the best NBA Jams, so this game, or the original are the best fun for an NBA slammin', jammin, slam dunking good time.The code to dunk from anywhere on the court is great fun to annoy your friends with. And the unlimited fire code works aswsome too."
2,The Logical End of Modernity,"Shubert M. Ogden is a thorough and consistent liberal theologian. That is, he clearly sees the apologetic task as of primary importance. Furthermore, he holds to the modern notion of autonomous reason. In On Theology, Ogden lays out what he sees the task of Christian Theology to be. That task is to establish a fully reflective understanding of the Christian witness. Theology has the double task of being appropriate to the Christian witness and credible to common human experience. Ogden should be noted in the context as a theologian answering the death of God movement and as a scholar arguing for the importance of theology in the secular university.Ogden is firmly in the process theology camp and is also a disciple of Rudolf Bultmann's project of ""de-mythologizing"" scripture. If you like those ideas, you will probably enjoy the book.... At any rate, Ogden seems to be important as he draws out what are the logical ends of the modern project."
4,Fun train and music,Wee sing likes to put a story with songs that you knew when you were a kid. These kids create places to explore and then take a ride on the train to explore them. Safety is mentioned and fun songs are presented. The train talks as does the caboose. There are fun things happening here. I showed it to kindergartners and first graders and some liked it some did not. My kids loved it. I think it depends on how active kids are and how interested in music. Some kids like a little at a time and come back to it. I got this for my grandkids.
4,Mom Sang Along Too!,"Here's my confession: I actually really liked this video and would encourage my kids to play it! I thought the story was cute and I loved the songs! I would find myself driving to work singing ""Chug-Along the Engine and Cubby the Caboose, going down the Wee Sing traaaack"" LOLKept the kids (and Mom!) entertained!"
5,Great DVD doe Train lovers who like to sing!,My son loves this Wee Sing Train DVD. He learned all the songs and it has taught him to care for someone when they get hurt. A very good buy.
5,Great First Video,My one-year-old daughter loves this video. She dances and claps her hands along with the songs and seems really intrigued by the characters. At 30 min. it holds her attention from beginning to end. It is a wonderful first video.
5,"Wee Sing DVD, great gift because of the memories!","My sisters and I grew up watching the Wee Sing Videos when we were younger. We'd often talk about random scenes/parts from the movie that only we would ""get"". Now that the four of us have small children/toddlers of our own I thought it would be great to gift a DVD version this year for Christmas. Everyone's reaction was priceless and we enjoy playing them for the small ones! The older ones are already busting into the songs we know and love!!-I gave this one to one of my sisters and her oldest (3 years) absolutely LOVES it!"
4,Your Kids will love it,"I bought this video three years ago when my oldest was three years old, and it is still among thier most wacthed videos.Sure the costumes are a bit cartoonish and the script is a bit silly but it has great songs that are easy for your kids to learn and even for adults it doesn't get 'old' or stale. Of the ""wee sing"" videos that I have seen this one is the best especially for the preschool and kindergarten age group. some of the other ""wee Sing's"" like the magical musical mansion seem to be aimed at a slightly older age group (1st to 3rd graders) and grow stale quickly. ""wee signdom"" is also good for the youger age group but my kids don't enjoy it as much, and niether do I."
5,Wee Sing Train a hit again!,"My 16 year old grandson watched this adorable video when he was a little boy, now he has younger siblings who are watching it and they love it too. The characters and songs are so cute everyone always sings along, and dances too."
4,4 stars for delighting my daughter!,"We have rented this video so many times that I had to purchase it! My daughter sings and hums tunes from ""Wee-Sing Train""! She's three years old and it is her favorite. I'm finally breaking down and buying it for Christmas. The singing and the characters are entertaining & stimulating. Until you here the chorus from ""brown carrot, red beet, brown potato, et al."" your life & veggies will not be complete!"
5,Lets rock it again,"Hi to all , Mike and jose lets do this again, This is Sean lead singer of casa on boca freestyle. another sleepless night. We had some great times. We have to rock this magic again and let it live once more. The time is now. Please get back. Miss all of you lets due a reunion"
1,Oops! Too much too late.,This particular edition is no more than a simple collection of Dostoevsky's works that you can buy for $125 from contemporary Russian bookstores here in the US.
2,Not up to the mark,"This KVM switch is not really worth the money. Major issues I have with it are:1. No hot keys to switch between CPUs. You have to toggle the button on the KVM ! (wake up IOGear - almost all KVMs have this functionality)2. When starting up a computer, you must have it selected on the KVM - otherwise the computer will complain of no keyboard / mouse being found.3. When switching between CPUs, there is a 3-5 second gap before the mouse and keyboard start to work on the machine. Shouldn't the switching to be much faster ?The good point about this KVM is that it is USB based and supports 2 additional USB devices - acts like a USB hub.I am sure there are better models out there."
2,IOGEAR GCS104U 4-Port MiniView USB KVM,"Bought this product to use with my MS Internet Keyboard which is a PS-2 keyboard (with a usb adapter). No matter how many times I attached the keyboard to the USB of the miniview, it would not detect it as an Internet Keyboard. Only as a HID Keyboard Device. This prevented me from using the shortcut buttons at the top of the keyboard.Also, when going into games, never of the keyboard keys would work which is strange. I even d/l the latest drivers from MS to get it to work and it still would not respond inside of games. But the keyboard keys work in stuff like Word and Visual Studio.So in all, it just turned my multi-functional keyboard into a generic usb keyboard which only worked in programs other then games. I would recommend staying away until IOGEAR or MS resolves this bug."
1,Garbage,"Bought this a ways back and the scroll wheel quit working at all within weeks. Tried air-dusting it, nothing worked. A hunk of junk."
4,Great mouse but wrong model,"Like Bob said its the wrong model but is still a great mouse, I don't have any problems with it"
3,Does the job,"The mouse is cheap and does the job. It's not an elite optical mouse, but it works fine and costs very little. Using it right now matter of fact."
2,smooth but has flaws,"Well, it was okay.Its smooth and is WAY better the the old one I had, but when I scroll down the arrow will start jerking around the screen, when Im not moving it at all.So when Im about the click something the pointer decides to go somewhere else, usually causing me to click at different locations, or make me close the boxes.Its annoying, constantly corrected the arrow.Or when I scroll and about to click the link, the arrow decides to highlight the whole page.It just has a mind of its own when I dont move it. For those who haave had this problem, know what Im talking about."
3,Simple and efficient,An efficient mouse... nothing special about it ! It does well what it is designed for !
5,"So far, so great","It's a good little mouse, a quiet little mouse (until I press a button; then it clicks/squeaks--a good thing), and works well on my wooden desk even with no mousepad. The light-technology works marvelously as does the scroll button. No installation, just plug in a USB and enjoy."
2,not the same as the one I ordered a few weeks ago,"Both looked the same in the photo, but the wheel on this one isn't fluid like the apparently identical one I ordered a couple weeks ago. Just has a clunky feel overall. is this a knock-off?"
4,Optical mouse works well with optical pad,"If you don't like cleaning your ball mouse when hair, etc. gets inside and makes it erratic, then this is the mouse for you. No moving ball to get gummed up. Uses a laser. Needs a mousepad with some kind of optical pattern to work well. I'm very pleased with this mouse."
1,mouse received is not the one i ordered,The mouse that I ordered is pictured but the mouse i received is not the same one and i was very disappointed. I will keep it and i will use it but i am not very happy .thank you for the fast shipping.
3,"Tight, squeeky button-wheel","I already had one of these mice, and it worked just fine. I ordered a new one for my laptop to carry around with it. This one was not nearly as nice. Must be weak quality control, because the mouse wheel is really firm and squeeky. Other than that, it works as expected."
1,Broken upon arrival,"This product's design is poor to say the least. The entire enclosure (both top and bottom) is plastic and there is only one tiny screw holding it all together. As a result, when I received this mouse it was split in half largely due to the the poor packaging Amazon sends the mouse in. I do not recommend this mouse to anyone."
3,Just a generic mouse,"This is just a generic mouse with two buttons and a wheel. It does everything you would expect a generic mouse to do, and is indistinguishable from the mouse that is shipped with most computer systems. It's fairly well built and somewhat comfortable to use, although it might feel slightly small if you have large hands. The mouse operates accurately on a wooden surface. This mouse is probably as good as it gets for this price point, but it's nothing to write home about.UPDATE: This mouse's scroll wheel is now malfunctioning after 5 months of use. One middle-click now frequently registers as two or even three middle-clicks, which is annoying when closing tabs in a web browser. Even though this mouse is inexpensive at $7.82, the value is quite poor considering its short functional lifespan."
4,good solid mouse,"good mouse, ball on top is maybe a little stiff, but all but the most discerning mouse user will be happy with it."
3,does the job but fragile,"the mouse does not feel well constructed, but it does the job. however it feels too fragile, like it wants to come apart"
1,Not what is advertised!!!,"You no longer get the SBF-96 that is advertised (which would also be a ps/2 mouse, NOT usb). I have the SBF-96 & wanted more. The SBF-96 is an excellent mouse. The mouse they send you is the UAE-96, which is a cheaper lower quality USB mouse. The UAE-96 sells for as little as five dollars. Also, it will NOT work with USB to PS/2 adapters. We already HAD a UAE-96, & it is nothing but problems with freezing for example. This WOULD be a great deal if it was actually the higher quality SBF-96. We sent the first UAE-96 back, & got the SAME for replacements after telling them the return was because of the MODEL they send us. We returned the second set also as they are NOT worth the money being charged (UAE-96) bad."
4,smooth reliable mouse,"I've bought a couple of dozen of these over the years - nothing fancy about it, just a mouse that works reliably and fits well in the hand."
2,Crippled Before a Year Was Out,"Like other cheap optical mice I've had from lesser-known manufacturers, it installs quickly and fits the bill perfectly for a while. Soon, the left mouse button develops ""multiple-click"" syndrome due to worn internal contacts and clicks random numbers of multiple times causing menus to open and close, or links to jump several ahead. Oh well, at this price maybe for a quick fix it's worth ordering, though my ten year old mice thrown in with new computers still work today so it may be a case of ""they just don't build'em like they used to..."""
2,dying after 16 months of use,UAE-96 modelworks fine until the left mouse begins to double click/multiple click on its own when I intend to only single click.A previous review has noted the same issue.Whaddya expect for a made in China $10 mouse right? it's like a disposable product.
1,Cheap made,It says USB port but instead it's a PS/2 port. I got this mouse with my new computer and a few months later the mouse breaks. Steer clear of this mouse.
1,Not as advertised,"The technical specs said ""USB port""; what I received, however, was a PS/2, which won't work on my laptop. Not worth the hassle to return, which is maybe what the vendor is hoping."
2,At least the cursor moves,"Is it worth it to return an $11 mouse that doesn't work when the return policy states that I will only get a percentage of the total back because the package is opened and I will have to pay for shipping? No. So now I have a mouse that has a moving cursor, but nonfunctional buttons. And now the world has one more piece of electronic trash about to go into a landfill. And I'm really curious why the package I received this mouse in says ""Only to be sold with a new computer."" I gave it 2 stars because at least the cursor moves, and it is a pretty comfortable design in my large hands."
2,Doesn't work with USB/PS2 adaptor,"I was replacing an old Logitech mouse which worked through a USB/PS2 adaptor. However, this mouse does not work with the adaptor from my old Logitech mouse."
2,Wrong Plug in,You need to describe the plug in in your description This unit has a parallel plug and mine is a USB This is truly vital information. Luckily my neighbor had one that would work I'm donating thus one to the Computer Lab at the senior center. Someone will probably still have an old parallel set up
4,Looked Fishy But Works Great,"I was surprised to find that this was not in the type of packaging you would find a mouse in a store like a box or clam shell but instead it was in a flimsy plastic bag saying ""For distribution with a new PC only."" It has worked just fine, but had I been purchasing as a gift I would have been sorely disappointed. It concerned me and would have left a bad impression on anyone else I would give it to expecting a ""new"" mouse not one that ""came free"" with something else. So I deducted a star for this. Not at all what I would expect based on the first-quality items received from Amazon in the past."
1,Kawasaki Jet Ski Manua,Excellent book with great diagrams and schematics. Would recommend to anyone using or biung a Jet Ski.BP
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a really cheesy collection of holiday tunes, and despite seeing names like the Coasters & the Shirelles, they are whatever current lineup recorded them. You can do much better with the r&r christmas cd's on Rhino records."
4,"The Legend of John Wilkes Booth: Myth, Memory, and a Mummy","Evans work was more the reason behind the David E. George/John Wilkes Booth legand and myth. He used some excellent resources in his work and did not shy away from the controversial book by Finis L. Bates, ""The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth"" and Izola Forrester's book ""This One Mad Act"". The resources in the back of the book are the biggest plus for anyone researching John Wilkes Booth."
5,Great Paranormal Romance,"""A sexy, well-written modern tale buttressed by the author's knowledge ofNative American spirituality."
5,16 Biggest Hits-Mickey Gilley,"Love Mickey Gilley's voice. He puts feeling in his music. It's a whole lot better than modern day music. Love ""Room full of Roses"" City Lights"" and Headache Tommorrow"". Wiish it was being played on radio today."
1,Off tha heeeeeezy,this joint is aight..cadillac tah be bustin shots at 50 which is kind of a bad idea but this joint is def sumthin that u can bump too and i recomend it
4,Tons of Toe Cleavage!,This shoe is SO cute. I love the pointed toe and the kitten heels. Unfortunately I'm way too conservative when it comes to toe cleavage. A little is fine. But shoes were meant to cover the foot. My foot was so exposed that it actually made me feel like the shoe would come off when I walked. No dice. Maybe if you have slender feet and long pointy toes :)
1,Not to my taste!,"Our family did not care for this product at all. It has a strong flavor that nobody in my family would eat. Even my husband, who eats about anything, would not eat it."
4,wish more computers had trackpoints,these are the same as the ones that came with my thinkpad. I Like the trackpoints with that more computers still used them.
2,Hard to find the right one,"It came with 1 each of Classic Dome Cap, Soft Dome Cap, and Soft Rim Cap.I really wanted a Soft Dome Cap and this isn't the same that came with my laptop. This one is too soft, like the ones offered in ebay for 100 pieces for $2 or something.The soft rim cap is comparable to original quality."
4,"Authentic, but different.","These are packaged in authentic lenovo packaging, but have an older part number on them. They are tagged as 91P8421 while the current caps through lenovo are marked 73P2698 - which this seller also sells, but it got worse reviews. They seem to be of the same material as far as texture and feel are concerned, but the soft rim cap is noticeably smaller than the original soft rim that came with my T400s. Kind of annoying as that's the one I prefer to use and it's not as big as the original. My finger tip doesn't sit flush against the concave rim like it used to. I guess I'll get used to it.. still a better deal than buying straight from Lenovo."
4,Perfect,"Got them for Thinkpad R61, compared to ones on Lenovo webpage they're waaay cheaper (price there was over 9 USD) and they fit perfectly, just like originals. Good price for 6 pcs of trackpoints. To me they're feel just a tiny bit harder than originals."
3,it's ok,"i wish these things were not so easily lost, but it's good to know I can get more right here, at a great price..."
4,"Great Lyrics, Some Catchy Tunes","'Genesis' features Joy's great voice and lyrics. This album has a few really good songs. I particularly like 'Hide', 'Beautiful Redemption', 'Silence', and 'God Only Knows'.Her songs feature lyrics that reflect issues that most of us experience. 'Silence' deals with praying and wondering if God is listening. He is, but there are times when most of us wonder due to our own shortcomings. Another one that has absolutely superb lyrics is 'Hide'. It is very catchy and gets played fairly often on Christian radio.Although there are a few songs that I think are just ok, the ones that are good make this album worth the cost. I recommend it."
1,Try Rachael Lampa or Kim Hill instead ........,"She looks good, the voice is good, but the attitude is so pretentious. And I can feel the no votes coming ..."
3,Isn't the same but not bad,"Well I agree with the previous users. Joy's voice does sound altered. It doesn't have to natural tone to it as her previous albums did liek By Surprise. There are some good songs though on the album. Stay and Hide are not bad songs. Her music has gone from a soft natural tone to a more pop, rockish music. I would recommend legally downloading selective songs or if you catch on to songs easilly I would buy the album."
5,Top notch Christian alternative/pop music,"Joy Williams - GenesisI am a 40-something who wants to share ""with it"" Christian music with my kids. This is one of the best CD's I found yet for that purpose. Really like that the music is good and the lyrics are not weak and wishy-washy like many others."
5,Good Eats,"We are living in Italy for a couple of years so we needed something that could help us survive when we go out to eat. This book is fantastic. We are slow using it because you have to look up every word in the decription of the meal, but the vast majority of the words are there!! We have friends that are fluent in Italian and they were quite impressed with this book. I highly recommend it."
5,Where has this been all my life?,"Picked this up for a trip but am already using it at home... I live in San Francisco where there are lots of restaurants that write their menus in Italian. And no matter how nice the servers are, I always feel like a rube when I have to ask what something is or how to say it. Thanks to this guide, I can scope out a menu beforehand and figure out what things are and even how to pronounce them. And it's a fun read to boot.Maybe this book should be categorized under ""self-help,"" because it sure makes me feel more confident!Great value for the price, too..."
4,Good Book,"Good, however not really needed. Almost all menus were in both Italian and English. This is not true in Germany, where you have to have a translator if outside of the tourist areas."
3,HP Advanced Gloss Photo Paper,"HP advanced photo paper is the paper recommended for my HP B9180 printer. The printer prints beautiful pictures, but I wish the advanced paper was thicker and did not scratch so easy. When printing fine art photo's you have to be very careful and let nothing touch the print, I use a static duster before framing."
4,Great paper Great Price,I have used several different papers and I love this one. Dries almost immediately. The only con I can state is the weight of the paper. I have used some of HP papers that are heavier weight. The price is also a big factor in my purchase of this product.
2,Canon + HP don't mix?,"I have the Canon Pixma 9000 Mkii And I needed to do some enlargements and some other test prints so I purchased the HP Advanced paper (it was what they had at my local office max) I usually print on Canon paper, but the HP for 13x19 was cheaper and the 5x7 was all they had for 5x7. I have my monitor calibrated to my printer so color is usually never an issue. But when I printed my colors were really off and very bright. My pinks were way too dark and the whole image posterized, so I had to mess with my color, brightness, and contrast settings.I may be passing judgement on this paper, but is it that I was supposed to use HP paper w/ an HP printer? But from my tests anyway, HP and Canon do not mix well at all."
5,HP Advance Photo Paper,"This is great paper for my B8500 series HP Photosmart printer. The photos have a nice soft glossy finish. The color and contrast are excellent. I have read that with my printer I should use the HP Advanced Photo paper and it seems like good advice. Other papers may be less expensive, but the HP printer and photo paper were most likely manufactured to be used together for optimal results."
2,"A Brief Critque of ""For the Love of Pugs""","I am a pug fanatic so I naturally bought this book. I was,however, very disappointed in it. The pictures are gorgeous but have absolutely nothing to do with the text. The text is excellent in some portions of the book but is also very detailed and at times difficult to follow. Had the text been illustrated by relevant pictures, drawings, maps etc, the text would have been much more interesting and easy to understand. This book reads as if it were the author's Masters thesis that he decided to have made into a book without putting any extra work into it. With a bit more effort this could have been a great book!"
2,Topic of entire book is history of the pug- cute pics though,"Ok, the photos are adorable. This is a wonderful coffee table book, but if you're looking for a guide to owning pugs, do not buy this book. Basically, the book is an in-depth study of the origin of the pug. It reads like a college term paper, which is not necessarily a bad thing, if that's what you're looking for. The introduction sounds like the author chose every other word from a thesaurus--wordy to the point of annoyance! The photos have nothing to do with the text. I bought this book thinking it was more of an owner's guide to pugs, which is why I'm disappointed. If you are studying the history of the pug, this might be a helpful reference tool."
3,"Look, but don't read","The photos in this book are fantastic, but the writing is truly HORRIFIC. It's clear the author has never met a 12-letter word (where a five-letter word would have done perfectly) that he didn't like. OUCH!"
4,Small but cute,Not sure why I even bought this; I have a glass stove top. Maybe we will use it camping; it might fit a can of beans in there. My four year old daughter likes it more than I do; she says that it is her pot because it is her size.
2,ONLY 1 HURDLE,when it had the word HURDLES i didnt think it would only come with just one hurdle. Not really worth spending money for just 1 hurdle. thanks for ripping me off
1,Get the other one instead!,"There is another dvd titled ""Here Is The Johnny Carson Show"". That's the one you need to buy, NOT THIS ONE! This disc contains only 2 episodes of ""The Johnny Carson Show"". The other disc contains these episodes PLUS an episode of ""Who Do You Trust"" and ""The Jack Benny Program"" (guest starring Johnny), and 2 Budweiser promo films that Johnny and the gang made in 1972 on the Tonight Show set. What's more the other disc is cheaper. BTW, the audio and video quality is very good on the other disc, too. If you liked Johnny or early live television, then BUY IT!! I really enjoyed it."
4,"""There's Johnny""","I have followed the career of Johnny Carson from ""Who do you Trust"" to his last appearance on David Letterman. I was not aware of the show he did called ""The Johnny Carson Show."" The Golden Age of Television was the place where millions of viewers became exposed to great talent. Non greater than Johnny Carson. I live in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, the place where Johnny, Ed and the Tonight Show team came to develop the Tonight Show. I have listened to many stories of the time they were here and wondered where many of the shows elements came from. I now know. Johnny's work on the DVD's I've just seen is the foundation of over thirty years of the greatest programs ever broadcast. His wisdom of keeping these tapes was pure genius. Thank you Mrs. Carson for sharing this adventure with us."
4,A great treat for Carson fans,"I started watching Johnny Carson with my parents when I was 5, and as a kid rarely missed it. I loved it as well as an adult. When I heard about these found tapes, I knew I had to see them. They are great fun to watch. You really do see in his early skits the traits that later made him such a master of comedy. You also get a feel for the culture at the time. There very little political comment, which was probably wise considering the McCarthy era. The skits and jokes were tame by our standards now, but watching this was still great fun."
2,For sure the worst Mega Man game,"I have played all of the mega man games, and I can say that this is totally the worst one. Not only is this a bad game by Mega Man standards, it is a bad game by any standard. The music is so annoying you'll scream so loud, you won't be able to hear the annoying music. Umm, don't waste your money on this game, unless you can get it for under ten dollars like I did. I'm serious, this is a really bad game. If you have a lot of money, and you want a good SNES Megaman game, buy Megaman X2 or X3."
5,A must own,"If you are interested at all in any of the Rat Pack entertainment, then this is a MUST HAVE CD. My only complaint isn't about the CD, but that it should be out on DVD! This CD not only has some of their best songs, but also some great dialogue. I'm hoping that the industry will be able to put this on DVD."
5,Can't Miss CD,"You can't miss buying this CD. Funny, hilarious, wonderful, and way cool. Dean Martin will have you rolling on the floor. But Dino takes a moment to belt out some superb and straight vocals as well. Next Frank comes out and does his thing and later is joined by Sammy Davis.One surprise that will be obvious here; is how Sammy Davis and Dino are actually are a much better sound than Frank. As a long time Sinatra fan, I have been lately buying Sammy CDs [I've Gotta be Me, The Wham of Sam] and Dean's Cd's ... and I am amazed at how superior Sammy and Dean sing vs. Frank; even though Frank got the all the headlines.This is a great CD you'll play alone and share with freinds time and time again."
5,This CD takes you to Vegas in its Heyday,"I was not even born when the Rat Pack ruled Las Vegas. However, this recording transported me to the Sand's Hotel before Vegas began to resemble Disneyland and before political correctness took over the country.The recording is excellent and the performance a treasure."
5,Bliss,"Nothing funnier than hearing humour from another time which is now slightly politically incorrect. Cheesy, funny, great timeless tunes."
5,Best of the Rat Pack,"This cd is a real treat. It's like stepping back in time for an evening of great entertainment. The music, singing, and jokes are all great. This cd is vastly better all around than the Live and Swingin' set (which I also bought just for the dvd). If you are a fan of the Rat Pack or just want to know what all the fuss was about, buy it and enjoy."
4,"Does the job,",Works fine on my Manfrotto 055XProb tripod. The quick release connects at the head of the tripod. Feels comfortable. Much better than carrying the tripod by hand or strapped to my backpack.
5,"Connection of the Church to Israel shown in Ruth 3,000 Years of Sleeping Prophecy Awakened","This book is a must for Christians seeking understanding about their Jewish roots and wondering why Jewish customs have meaning for Christians today. The 12-part section, ""Did You Know?"" at the back of the book is invaluable for understanding biblical Judaism and giving Christians appreciation for their Jewish Messiah's culture. The Book of Ruth is presented as historical fact, but its underlying prophetic message is examined verse by verse with startling insights. The purpose of the book is to encourage unity of Christians and Jews, which will be the ultimate reality when the ""natural branches"" are grafted back into ""their own olive tree"" (Romans 11:24)."
3,A beautiful Bible Study.,"This is a thoughtful, insightful, and yet beautiful bible study of one of the bible's marvelous women. It chronicles a love story in the midst of the disastrous time of the Judges."
4,reviw,"the product was as requested, but the difference to what appeared to be in stock and what was actual seemed off, this caused a delay in delivery for a week or so."
2,Not as great as could be,"This album lacks most AMON DUUL II jewels that appeared on Yeti, Phallus Dei, Wolf City, Vive la Trance, Made in Germany and could never be termed greatest hits. AMON DUUL II is a fantastic Progressive Rock group with remarkable creative and technical skills and this album does not reflect that greatness at all... Most of the tracks come from the relatively weak eighties albums."
4,Informative introduction to polio history,"Knowing very little about vaccines and the history of Polio, I learned quite a bit from the book. Like other readers stated, there was quite a bit of extra information that I skimmed over and the author seems to idealize Salk quite a bit, but besides that I enjoyed the book. He does make a good point about the Salk vs Sabin issue. Salk's solution was a quick and dirty implementation which was very effective. Ultimately a combination of the live and killed virus served to almost erradicate the disease, but salk saved a lot of lives and a lot of anguish by getting a solution out very quickly instead of wading through the proper social channels, which are designed to feed the hosses at the top, and not solve problems quickly."
5,Thrilling Medical Tale,"This is wonderfully compelling story of the race to cure polio, a disease that--if you're old enough to remember--lingered in the minds of terrified mothers and children everywhere fifty years ago. It also offers an indepth look into the life of Jonas Salk, a fascinating man whose drive to cure this disease was remarkable. Well-told, exciting--tough to put down. For fans of the The Great Influenza and The Greatest Generation."
5,Great Game!,"I was replaying Aerobiz but after a while it gets a little too simplistic and easy for me. I looked up the sequel and thought why not? So far I like Aerobix Supersonic a lot! It is a little more involved, as now the world is split into 7 regions, in which you'll need to be #1 in passengers (in a varying number of regions depending on difficulty). Route efficiency is now more involved as far as passenger loads, the stats of the cities you choose, and being affected by your network and interregional traffic as a whole. So if you like Aerobiz, but you want a little more challenege and depth to the gameplay, then this is a great sequel! I only wish I'd been more attentive to the seller from whom I bought the game used, as it'd be nice to have the instruction manual."
1,Sent these back on Amazon's dime...,"I finally got this item and went to hang it... well, all the platforms that the glass sits on are mounted crooked... NO GOOD!!!"
4,Great Balm and Cute Tin,I bought this balm for the tin but found that I love the the lip balm. It's smooth but not sticky and lasts a long time.
2,Better Boxers Abound,"Spend the extra few dollars for a pair of 2-xist or Calvin Klein boxers.If you prefer boxers that are a bit longer than usual, and have a slightly baggier fit, these Abboud boxers might be right for you. However, they have an awful seam that's sure to annoy you between the cheeks. They wrinkle up an amazing amount in the dryer. I'll keep wearing them, but I wish I had bought something else."
4,"A very good, yet very frustrating game","This game is fun to play, but gets very difficult once you get past the first 5 levels."
2,what happened to chris pirsons writing,"Chris piersons first dragon lance novel was excellent, this on the other hand was forced, the charactors are dull and the plot desperate, there are nice touches but they are not enough. I would like to see Mr Pierson do some more, spirit of the wind was excellent."
3,"Neat story, but could we find a replacement for Dezra?","I have read almost all of the Dragonlance novels, skipping the occasional book for lack of interest. This story was interesting, with a good premise based on the Chaos War and its remnants. The story also allowed the reader to learn more about the centaurs, which provided new and entertaining story lines. Of course, poor old Caramon is dragged through another adventure and does his best to uphold his part, but does every writer have to come up with an irritatingly stupid foil to Caramon? The character of Dezra (his daughter)wasn't interesting, continuously spouted inane retorts and dialogue, and generally was a hateful central character. There was nothing to like about her, nor was there any reason to hope she survived her ""quest"". I pray that TSR does not waste any more books on the adventures of the ungrateful, idiot Dezra. Thank goodness this story had a number of central characters. Except for Dezra, this ""Quest"" wasn't bad."
2,I like Pierson but not this book,"I was looking forward to reading this book from Pierson, but I was very dissapointed. (Although I might have high expectations after reading the Kingpriest Trilogy) One reason I didn't enjoy this book is due to the way Dezra treated Caramon. It kind of ruined the story for me.Just don't base your opinion of Chris Pierson based solely on this book."
4,Great addition to The Bridges of Time Series.,"The plot in this book was fast paced, with good, descriptive battle scenes. The characters were well developed over the book. Dezra developed from an immature rebellious teen, into a young woman who could turn out to be good or evil. Caramon was portrayed with great realism and fitted into the storyline well. The centaurs and other species who played a part in this book were also interesting. Overall, the book built up to a great climax which didn't disappoint. I look forward to seeing more of Dezra in the future."
3,"Great charcters, predictible and simple story","I have read many of the Dragonlance novels. All of the original, and several of the 2nd generation titles. ""Dezra's Quest"" falls into the later category. While I found the charcters in this a joy to read, I found several faults with the actual story overall. Yes this book is a typical tsr book, and does seem similar to many other stories throughout fantasy fiction. What the author lacked in story he more than made up for in charcter development and believability. I do however think the auther had the end of his book in mind, and was more concrned with that, than how to reach it. Overall, there was a lot of jumping around, a lot of time lapsing, and a lot of predictablility. The charctaers of Trephas, and Dezra are a welcome addition to the Dragonlance world, and I look forward to seeing more stories involving them."
2,Lacking in so many ways.,"This has to be the worst Dragonlance book I have ever read(and I've read them all).What happened to Caramon? He never was that bright...but he was a fierce warrior. Now for some strange reason he is a complete weakling who has to be protected by Dezra, his daughter?The plot is awful. We are led on an adventure to chop down a tree. Come on...I usually recommend any of the Dragonlance titles to fantasy readers, but you may want to skip this one."
3,not bad,"This is one of the better Dragonlance books, a solid effort which stands out from the trash TSR sometimes turns out. Well-paced and interesting, the characters are cliches, but seeing as how its dragonlance, I can live with that."
1,It Fell Apart!,"I filled it with oil, and immediatly it began to leak all over the place. I had to keep it in a plastic bag because of the leakage. Even though I used the oil recommended for this product I suspect it may have caused the glue that holds it together to fail. After a few days I was using it on a small glass project when it suddenly dumped all of it's oil out onto the glass. Then it fell apart. The grip split down the middle and the cutting head fell off. This is not what I generally look for in a product. It was a waste of money."
1,IT LEAKS,"I DID NOT LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS, SOMEONE SAID THIS GLASS CUTTER LEAKED ALL OVER, I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS JUST THIERS,WELL MY CUTTER WILL NOT HOLD OIL EITHER"
5,Perfect Score Professional Pistol Grip glass cutter,I have arthritis in my hands and I have a difficult time of grasping any type of item without them falling out of my hands. This product has a nice firm grip and makes cutting glass easier.
3,Okay book about lesbians of colour (spelled purposefully),"This is a British anthology on lesbians of color. The lack of Latina and Native American voices in this book is a sign of its Britishness. If you liked the ""Piece of My Heart"" anthology, you should like this. It reminds me of ""This Bridge Called My Back"" in some ways as well. The context is different from America's and this may frustrate some readers. Still, those interested in books about lesbians of color should add this to their collection."
1,Test software is a messy junk.,"NEVER buy this book. The test software is extremery hard to maneuver. It will comsume your precious time and frustrate you.It can even crash your computer.You cannot remove it because ""Remove GMAT diagnostic."" is the only option given and the relevant file is even missing. I do not know how this ""GMAT"" thing got in.It is a shame on Princeton Review to publish and sell this kind of junk software."
4,Useful,"I think that the science section of this book is not as difficult as the ACT tests are. Otherwise, this contains useful information and good practice tests. I would buy this with the Real ACT Book, though, to make sure to get good science help."
4,Clever and Contageous!,This book was very helpful for me in preparing for my ACT. It is filled with an abundance of tips and lessons that take you directly to the information you will definitely need to master! It was easy to study and even led me to want to read further... I would recommend it to anyone!
1,Connectors Won't Work.,"Wasted many connectors due to the fact these connectors don't work. RG6 Cable ends separate easily after being compressed with these connectors, it never happened before using different brand of connectors."
3,I'm a meat-eater..,"This chili is pretty good, seems to have a slight tomato taste to it which actually works well.Unfortunatly, it tries to fake it like it has ground beef, which makes it sort of strange to get used to. If you know what i'm talking about here and are ok with that, I'd guess this is something you would enjoy."
5,Worthington Chili,"My family and I use this product to enhance many meals. They love the chili especially with lima beans and the color is a wonderful blend. We used to drive about 25 miles for this product and the Worthington Link, but thanks to Amazon, we can purchase from the Web. It is a blessing!"
5,Delicious!!,"Very good stuff. You can even eat it right out of the can! Sometimes I mix in a can of petite cut tomatoes and chili powder, and then sprinkle cheddar cheese on top prior to serving. This is good in tacos as well."
4,Just Great,This book was really worth the 2 hours I spent reading it. It was really clever of Baker to give us the flashbacks into Alisha and Mitch's past. It really helped you to understand how they fell in love. The real plot of this story in my opinion was to undercover all the lies that tore them appart. The most hurtful lies were the ones from their fathers. First telling Mitch that his mother was dead. Then Alisha's father telling her that the baby she was having by Mitch was stillborn. Man what fathers would do to keep their children under lock and key. Besides the gloomy parts this book will give you a good laugh. I had to keep covering my mouth to keep me from laughing out loud. All in all this is a great book hope you enjoy.
3,not particularly authentic!,The storyline was okay but the 20th century dialog didn't fit with the mid-1800's story.
2,Bland and greasy,"I was very disappointed with this oil. For all the talk of Picholine olives being more flavorful, this oil is quite bland. While it isn't the worst olive oil to buy, there is no good reason to buy this oil. Many of the supermarket olive oils I've tried have more aroma and flavor."
1,Very poor product,Very p[oor product--hard to fasten--does not stay closed--does not do the job--money wasted--some companies will do anything to get your money
4,Very absorbent. Soft and comfy,Wish the tabs on the sides were longer so it stays put on more active nights. She uses the bumpers on one side which makes it short to tuck in.
3,Soaker Mattress Pad,It definitely holds 6 cups of liquid. I gave it three stars because I really wish that the pad was wider. The part that soaks up the liquid doesn't stretch all the way across my son's twin bed. It's just a few inches short.
4,They work ...,"Cover a decent amount of a twin size bed. Stay in place. Easy to change in the middle of the night. I haven't had them for very long so I can't speak as to how they hold up in the wash, long term, but they seem like they'll be good through potty training."
2,Thin material ripped in washing,"I bought two of these and two of the Quilted Waterproof Mattress Overlays 36 x 54"" and I am not happy with either one. These have torn where the seam of the pad portion meets the tuck in portion that goes under the mattress. They are not made of a quality material and my kids aren't big movers in the night, but every morning I have to reposition these a lot because the bottom just slides around. I think for the money we should be able to get overlays that are better quality. I don't mind spending money for quality. I bought these for my 3 1/2 year old twins as an overlay so I wouldn't have to change the sheets if there was a night time accident. But I would not recommend these, nor the other overlays I referenced above. I have had both brands for approx. 3 months."
3,Better than some..,"I thought this would be great for my son because he moves a lot at night and the other mattress pads shift out from under him. I like the wrap around sides but they are a little hard to tuck in all the way, and this isn't as absorbent as described. My son actually thinks this one is garbage."
3,These were perfect till...,"Used these and theReusable Bedpads - 34x36 in, absorbs 1000ccfor my daughter till I discovered the Chummie.It's a bedwetting cure that worked for my daughter. Worth a try. Highly recommended."
1,where is it?,"It has been over a month and i still do not have it. i am hoping it is a real awesome product you know, like a kid waiting for Christmas."
2,Eh...,"I have used this pad for almost two weeks, and I have had to wash about three or four times. Already the fuzzy quilted top has begun to fuzz up and pill like crazy. The pad protects the bed well but if you don't put the pad in the washer immediately after an accident it retains an awful pee smell, and contaminates other clothes as well. The sides that wrap under the mattress are flimsy and difficult to get in place.I have previously used a similar waterproof pad (from another company) to put on top of my potty-training preschooler's bed sheet. The other pad had a nice smooth sheet-like top and protected the bed from accidents well, up until the time the waterproof material on the back deteriorated due to age/washings (at least three years). It was also easier to tuck under the mattress than this new one. I am not impressed with this pad."
3,Ok.. doesnt stay in the right place,"I bought two of these for my two preschool age boys, they have bunk beds and without a box spring these do to stay in place very well.. I thought the sides would connect under the mattress and they dont.. they also do not cover the whole middle of a twin size mattress.. they edges of the bed are not protected."
5,Excellent!,"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old son who, even with a pull-up on, manages to get his bed wet. This doesn't happen every night but when it does happen you end up giving him a shower and changing his bed sheets. Now it is a breeze to just remove the Soaker Mattress Pad, tuck a second one and call it a night. (If it could only give my son a shower, the pad will not only be great but magical and there wouldn't be enough stars to rate this product!) It is easy to tuck and remove. I have washed it many times and it is still in great condition. I also like that, even though it doesn't cover his bed completely, it does cover most of it so there is no way he will have an accident outside of the pad. This was an excellent buy and I don't know how I didn't discover it sooner."
4,Works pretty well but not wide enough,"We have been using these pads for a couple of months now, and for the most part it works great. My one complaint is that the absorbent part of the pad doesn't cover the entire bed and is in fact several inches too narrow. My daughter's mattress is a standard twin size so I was surprised that this pad wasn't wider. There has been at least once that we have had wet sheets because of this issue."
4,great,"love the activities! As a therapist, it gives some great suggestions on actual activities to do. I love the proactive nature of this book!"
4,Fascinating overview of where medical practice is heading.,"This book offers one of the first bits of good news for physicians who are struggling to deal with managed care. The author provides some interesting and strategic insights on how to get to a new equilibrium between health plans, hospitals, and physicians. There is much trauma occuring in health care today, but this is one book that seems to lay out a logical framework for making the system evolve to the next stage."
5,Entertaining and informitive read,This was a well written book by someone with inside knowledge of the Trump organization. The reader learns a lot about Trump's personal life and the inner workings of the casino industry. Highly recommended.
2,Poor production,"Lets be perfectly frank. The only reason this movie had any traction back in the 70s is because of its sex scenes. This R version deletes all of those. You're left with a piss-poor production with characters that where at best, inaccurately portrayed. The only highlights where Helen MIrren and Malcolm McDowell's performance."
3,Famous film for history,This film carries some factual historical events in a different way..Great acting from English actors.Story line kept my interest up
4,Caligula (Unrated Edition),"Great movie!!! I lost my copy, and replaced it! I showed it to a friend and she loaned it out to someone. I think in total six of my friend have seen it."
3,Not as I expected.,Movie quality is not as what I expected as a Blue Ray disk. It can be done better just take a look at what 20 Century FOX did to the James Bond firm! I am very disappointed about this Blue Ray disk.
1,Not good enough,"The steps were shiney, but not close to the size they were suppose to be. The order was for 54"" steps, I thought since they were for my vehicle, (perfect fit) they would be 2 x 54"" for my 4 door full sized pick up - but I got 2 @ 27"" each. If you add them both up, they are 54"", nice one guys...got this one over on me, might work as a half a step on one door. Also, the recommended adapter to mount them does not fit my vehicle, (was guarenteed to be a perfect fit); I called and was told it must have been mislabeled....imagine that. They got me again. I would not recommend this unless you want to roll the dice to see whatever the packing person felt like putting in the box. It MIGHT fit, it MIGHT NOT fit. You roll the dice. Not one time was I ever given the chance to return them for the correct set I ordered and paid for. Holiday rush? You decide. Me, I'm going to pay the extra money at the dealership from now on. It might cost more, but it IS guarenteed."
4,Great band rising...,"This was one of Doug Aldrich's amazing nineties bands, pursuing a type of rock combining influences from Whitesnake, Badlands,and Led Zeppelin into an excellent and dynamic style,which made them legends in Japan. All the songs are great on this compilation spanning all the albums in the band's short lived career. Serious collectors owe it to themselves to get this overlooked introduction to the band."
1,"Slow, slow, slow","I'm a huge Uncle Tupelo fan, but ""March"" is the forgotten CD for me. And I tried -- over and over. It's wrist-slittingly slow and lifeless. ""Anodyne"" and ""Still Feel Gone"" make my top 20 of all time. This one will remain dusty in the back of my collection, forgotten."
5,Uncle Tupelo's best,"This is by far my favorite Uncle Tupelo album because this is the album that best shows Uncle Tupelo's folk influence. This album has a perfect blend of original songs, and traditional songs the band learned from a Missouri folk compilation tape they heard. Its also good to see a CD that has worthwhile liner notes. The liner notes explain the band's background and the inspirations for the album, which makes for interesting reading for any Uncle Tupelo fan. Out of all the Farrar/Tweedy albums, I rank this one second only to ""Trace""."
5,Best Video Game,"This video game is the best that I have ever played (it even beats out Master of Orion 2). The graphics aren't impressive, but the sheer size of the game is amazing. You can play the game 100 times and each time it will be different. I got this game over 10 years ago and I still play it every few months."
5,The best game I ever played,"I enjoyed this game so much when I was younger. It is really perfect in every aspect. There is fighting, trading, dating, adventure, pirates, royalty, etc... I check all of the time to see if it has been released in PS2 or similar format. I have yet to play a more enjoyable game and hope to see it released on an updated scale at some point in the future."
5,Excellent,"Excellent, doing what is was made to do. Nice chrome, looks like it is part of the exhaust. I will recommend it, if you need to put on 2 inch exhaust."
4,"Nice looking, works well, simple install","This is a quality shield. Finish is nice, clamp brackets are welded, standard hose clamps.This is a great option if you can't find a specific guard for your bike/exhaust. My only complaint is that they only come on one length (7""). My application would have been better suited to a 5"" guard, but the 7"" works well enough. Installation is simple, and it has a nice integrated appearance with the entire pipe/exhaust system if you get the hose clamps mounted so tha that the screw is at the bottom or back of the pipe.Recommended. Mfr. needs to make different lengths."
2,Disappointing,"What a sad thing it is to see a trilogy run out of steam in the last book. Juliet Marillier started out so well in Daughter of the Forest, and while I thought that Son of the Shadows suffered a bit from the classic middle book syndrome, I had high hopes for the end. They were dashed in Child of the Prophecy. I guess sometimes a book is meant to be a stand alone, it is not thick enough to be stretched into three, and in this case that is clear. Marillier uses a fluid language style, but characterization is her weak spot, and it gets weaker as the trilogy progresses. I wish her well; I think she has a lot of potential to grow into. But it is not realized in this book."
2,Kindle Typos are frustrating,"The story itself is good but I am SO frustrated with the hundreds of typos in the Kindle edition. It looks like they used some type of print recognition software that misread MANY words. I do not recommend reading this book in the Kindle Edition unless you like decoding typos on almost every page. I have no idea if the print edition is as bad, I would certainly hope not."
4,"revealing, appropriate end of a magnificent trilogy","At first I was a little disapointed with this book, it seemed a major departure from the previous two novels. However, like the previous novels Child of the Prophcey is very well written; details, people, and especially emotions come alive. This last novel of the triology didn't leave me hanging, questions were answered, and I was definately satisfied, especaily with the nice twist in the end. Overall this novel ends the trilogy with emotion and a profound message illustrated with graceful and detailed writing. I feel like I'm repeating myself, and probably am, but I was just so satisfied with this book, and that is the best way I can describe it."
4,A good finale for the trilogy.,"I gave Book One 4 stars, Book Two 5 stars, and now Book Three 4 stars. It is also very good, but SON OF THE SHADOWS remains my favorite of the three. Recommended reading."
4,Different from the first two,"I personally enjoyed the first two books of the trilogy better, but this was a very satisfactory ending. Fainne is a different kind of main character, struggling to define herself between good and evil. I didn't even always like her, but that wasn't a bad thing. This book has a lot to live up to, finishing up such an involved story, and it does, tying up all the loose ends very well and explaining a lot in the process. Two of the major plot twists I saw coming, but I was wrapped up enough in the story not to care. Definitely worth it."
3,Not as good,"Juliet's writing is exceptional, and I am taken into her world immediately and always. Unfortunantely, the characters are not as interesting, and I do not have any feelings for them. To me, they are simply a story, and not as real as Liadan or Sorcha's stories. I do not think I would read this book if it were not the conclusion to the great first two books."
3,Sevenwaters Trilogy,"Yet another trilogy about how Great Britain caused the death of Avalon. Ho Humm. I read this third book in 4 hours - tomorrow I'm off to a local ""buys used books"" bookstore which gives good prices and buy something more engaging and unique."
3,I'm conflicted ...,"... This book is great! The whole trilogy is great! I love the rising female fantasy writers because of the emotion they build into their stories. But what I don't understand (and maybe this is bacause I am a male) is why some of the up and coming female fantasy authors seem to be hanging on to sexually explicit scenes (or at least scenes with overly explicit descriptions and conversation) such as what one would find in a pulp fiction lust novel. Elizabeth Haydon is another such author who wrote a wonderful trilogy, a wonderful heart-ripping love story, but cheapened it with such imagery. Isn't it possible to have lots of emotion, reveal the evil side of humanity, and still keep it rated PG?"
2,Sappy and contrived,"The first two volumes in the series were better, though occasionally I had problems with reinvented fairy tales, and admire more the writers who actually come up with their own ideas completely. But this book reeked, I'm sorry. In an attempt to be more action oriented, Ms. Marillier falters badly. She should stick to the more romantic fairy tale fantasy she writes. There will always be a market for retold fairy tales, sadly."
1,Had to hold my nose on this one,"I think Juliet should have quit while she was ahead. The first two books were fairly good, even if the first person narration was grating at times. But this last book was unbearable. It had a bitterness to it that the others didn't, a kind of pettiness that was not sympathetic, it was merely annoying. Additionally, I found a number of details historically inaccurate or inconsistent. The first two are worth buying in paperback. This last one isn't worth having at all."
4,Kindle Version - No Table of Contents,I love the Sevenwaters series. I first read this book through the library then bought the Kindle version because I knew I would want to read it again and again. My only complaint with the Kindle version is there is no Table of Contents and therefore no easy way to jump to a particular chapter.
3,Different than the 1st two....,"The heroine is not too likable in this book --- definitely not like the first two books. It was still OK and I did continue on to the Heir of Sevenwaters (somehow the 4th book in this ""trilogy""). In the Heir - the heroine is also not as ""strong"" as in the 1st two books. I liked the 4th book better than the 3rd."
1,Disgraceful Trash,"Absolutely unbelievable. If you had the miraculous experience of playing the PC game Ultima 7, do not be fooled by this cheap imitation. The original game was one of the very first truly interactive worlds, and was a very open world. Not to mention fantastically fun and spellbinding. Now this ungodly filth, on the other hand, should not be allowed to be labeled with the name Ultima. Upon inserting the cartridge into my SNES, rubbing my hands together with anticipation, my first(and last) 10 minutes into the game, I developed a severe headache and had to drink down a bottle of pepto bismol to refrain from vomiting blood. My hopes and dreams were crushed. I had lost feeling in half my face, and had lost memories from my childhood. What I am trying to say is; Abandon all hope ye who buy this game. It would be infinitely more fun to crawl through broken glass and be sprayed in the eyes with battery acid. If only I could give it 0 stars."
1,Get the PC version instead,"I absolutely agree that gamers seriously considering playing Ultima VII should invest their money and time into the PC version. The SNES version significantly changed the story, gameplay and overall experience. Unfortunately, the SNES version serves no substitute to the legendary, influential masterpiece known as Ultima VII.Ultima VII's beauty belongs to the fact that you can play with a memorable cast of characters and have fun doing exactly what you're not supposed to do. Ultima VII gives you the opportunity to act like an obnoxious little Avatar, doing absolutely everything in your power to confuse, frustrate and enrage the characters. The SNES version pales in comparison, and I am afraid I make a gross understatement by saying so.The time it takes to find a copy of Ultima VII and get it working on a Windows XP machine is well worth gamers' trouble. You will have a truly unique gaming experience that many do not know exists."
4,Science Fiction Lives!!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! It's wonderful to see this life affirming story. I have long been a fan of science fiction, but lately much of it has been rather depressing. This book brings back the wonder of the possibilities that might exist and how healthy, rational, intelligent people would deal with the difficulties of being pioneers. I highly recommend this book to anyone who needs a pick-me-up!As a first time author (of literature other than text books) this is an absolutely amazing accomplishment! I congratulate Mr. Pekarek and hope he continues to write! I am eagerly awaiting the sequel and will buy it.I met Mr. Pekarek and bought his book after talking to him. He really believes that life is wonderful! His book reaffirms his life views. Please keep writing Mr. Pekarek!"
4,Great Book ...odd Printing,"This was a very good book with lots of interesting and fascinating developments. I did not like the printing format (style) in that it is as large as a Time or Newsweek Magazine and a bit hard to handle. Loved the content, hated the format !I did buy this from Amazon.Com and am glad I did ."
3,The story and style get better,"I read this book not knowing what to expect. The writing style sounded kind of like an engineer ---- because the author IS an engineer. But I liked the story enough to read the 2d and 3d books in the series. The writing and the story get better. I hope there is a 4th book in the series, as I want to see what happens next. In the meantime, I will go back to Clive Cussler while I try to locate book 4."
2,A Fragile Main Battle Tank,"The tank, although a fun toy for my grandsons, arrived cracked and broken in three places. It was poorly packaged. An hour was spent with a screwdriver and super glue to get the toy ready for use. It is overall of poor quality construction & fit and very cheaply made (including the remote control). The plastic is fragile and the tread is very flimsy and comes off easily (and it is difficult to get back on). The grandsons thoroughly enjoyed the toy, especially the air gun (which frequently doesn't fire unless you tap the toy to redistribute the little yellow pellets). The speed of the toy is too fast; there is no slow speed, just fast or faster. The rechargeable battery pack is poorly designed and difficult to remove, recharge and replace in the battery compartment. A great improvement would be to have a recharging port on the tank itself, so the battery pack would not have to be removed every time it needs to be charged. Overall, the toy is not a good value for the price."
2,hard time returning,"I purchased this for my son's 10th birthday. He thought he would love it, but when we set it up, there must have been a short in it and it did not work at all. Now I'm having a terrible time returning it. Still waiting for help from amazon."
2,not so great,"This tank is a beautiful looking piece if you just want to display it. after charging the batteries for 5 hours like it said the tank would only move about 2 feet then stop for a few seconds and then move another few feet. it took about a minute to turn it around. i changed the batteries in the transmitter but that didn't fix it either. i tried charging the battery for a few more hours but still didn't work. it has a very poor design because you have to remove the battery each time you charge it. although the tank looks really nice, it is built poorly. the additional parts that come with it do not fit, it's like they were made for somthing else then thrown in with this. the gun does shoot very well but the barrel does not recoil like it said in the description. the tracks also seem pretty flimsy and i thought they were going to come off when i turned the tank."
1,OTC(Ohio Tool Co) or CTC (China Tool Co),I am totally fed up with paying good american earned money on China junk.I dont care how good you say the product is its china junk.I am also am disappointed with the same American companies that farm out for cheaper manufacturers.
5,Great service,The product arrived earlier than expected .. so it was a very fast shipping and it proved to be a great gift for a perfect price.
2,"Great live performance, ruined on DVD.","I bought this DVD when it was first released and the video looked very compressed and the menu navigation was messed up, this lead to Ultra Records recalling the DVD and sending me a new copy. The new copy fixes the menu and has improved video quality, but when playing this DVD through my Stereo and Headphones I noticed a major change in the DVD. THE AUDIO HAS BEEN MODIFIED AND SOUNDS WORSE THAN THE ORIGINAL DVD THAT WAS RECALLED. The change wasn't in the quality of the recording, but rather sounded like someone modified the audio track to have a lower tone in audio. I am not pleased with the change and would rather have my recalled DVD back with the original audio recording.If it weren't for the ruined audio I would have given the DVD 4 stars as it was a great show, but Ultra Records really messed up this DVD as I highly recommend no one buy it."
2,"Not the best video edit, but music is amazing",The music is great but the video editing is terrible to say the least. I bought this DVD as I have been unable to make a live show. The editing makes it hard to appreciate the amazing visuals and stage show. For half the intro the camera is panning around the crowd instead of showing the stage/screen. You are better off just downloading the music from beat port or buying the 4X4=12 CD and watching youtube clips. Hopefully he releases an HD version of the Meowington Haxs tour but has a different editor.
2,Pretty bad,"I love Deadmau5. I think he's one of the greatest artists on the planet right now, and was hoping that this DVD would successfully convey the spirit of Deadmau5 live.The DVD is a huge failure. The main reason is the camerawork. I am honestly not sure if the cameraman/men knew that they were filming a live concert. It's ridiculous, literally (I mean literally) 90% of the footage consists of random shots of the crowd doing absolutely nothing. There are times when you just want to yell at the DVD to show the stage, it's insane.The DVD doesn't convey what Deadmau5 is like live, but it is indeed hard to express something like that through video, so that's kind of a given. The audio sounds fine, but not as amazing as it is live of course.The timelapse was the only thing on the DVD I found interesting. Don't waste your money, I would say.I love you Deadmau5, but your DVD sucks."
1,Get what you pay for,"If you are looking for a sturdy shovel that will last, find something else.Construction is questionable. Materials are questionable.The handle fit is loose in the head, and wobbles. The head is riveted to the handle, and the rivet was loose, too close to the tip of the handle and off center. This item most likely break with the first hard use.In order to make it serviceable, I had to drill out the rivet, epoxy the original hole, reset the handle, redrill, replace the rivet with a bolt to stop the handle wobble."
4,Beautiful gift volume,"This was purchased as a gift, and was received with great enthusiasm. The NASB version is supposed to be the most accurate, translated anew from the oldest writings. The book itself is gorgeous and unique: medium/light blue with silver-gilt edges, and comes in a protective binder. It's lovely just to hold the book. Very nice feel. Highly recommended for a special gift, or just for your own purpose."
4,A Thoughtful Integration,"Dr. Bucci's book is a thoughtful integration of Cognitive Science and psychoanalytic thinking. The book is obviously for those who are in the field or are students of the field. She explains basic concepts in Cognitive Science and psychoanalysis in a lucid manner. She is a creative thinker who attempts to cast off what cannot stand up well in light of current science but shows how much of psychoanalysis can stand up better than many critics think. The chapters on her research were not as strong as the theoretical chapters, as she was not clear on what her complex coding system should expect to see in various situations. She has done much more research since the book was published and interested readers would do well to follow up this book with her research articles."
2,A low RA book,"Bucci writes a great deal about what she calls Referential Activity, the ability to put experience into symbols and words in a specific and concrete way. But the book itself shows little RA, with page upon page of densely jargon-backed theoretical discussion, and almost no concrete examples of the highly abstract and difficult concepts presented. This makes it almost impossible to understand much what Bucci is saying without an extensive background in both cognitive science and psychoanalytic theory, a background few share. Morever, Bucci seems to take her integration too far, combinbing the work of cognitive science authors and perspectives that are strikingly incompatible without really dealing with this incompatibility. Cognitive science, like psychoanalytic theory, is a pluralistic, even anarchistic group of heterogenous voices, hardly the kind of unified front that Bucci often seems to want it to be."
3,Pictures missing,A very humorous and interesting rendition of the story. I quite enjoyed it. The only problem with the kindle version is that the pictures were not there.
2,"Reminiscent of _1066 and All That_, but without the accuracy or humor","The basic conceit of Wodehouse's part of this book was to tell a version of the legend of William Tell as if all the characters were ordinary English idiots of the early twentieth century. The effect is rather like that of _1066 and All That_, but without the accuracy, and hence without the humor. Wodehouse's prose was written to accompany verse by John W. Houghton, which in turn was written to accompany illustrations by Philip Dadd. I haven't seen the illustrations, but the verse is much worse than Wodehouse's prose; I'm sure he could could have done it better himself. Wodehouse's style was quite good even early in his career, so the book is readable; it's just not worth reading if you can read his later work instead."
2,perfect 10,"Good quality, although very cheesy narration and video use. The women are absolutely stunning, hearstoppingly beautiful, but there is NO nudity.I wasn't looking for pornography, just something along the lines of the magazine, which I really enjoy by the way. But this disappointed me, I got it because I am missing issues of the magazine and wanted to see the women from them. It didn't happen. Overall, I would recommend against this video if you are looking for a little nudity or erotica."
4,Beautiful!! A+++++,"I ordered 3 of these to mount on my columns under my deck. They look great. The only thing bad I can say is that the glass just sits on the top of the base with nothing holding it in place. Otherwise its stunning. Simple design,true black color,I love them. Amazon should get more of these. For $10.50 each....you cant beat it."
3,Easy read. Pleasant characters,Everyday people. Good mystery without the Gore. I found the reveal of the culprit a little too abrupt. Can't wait for the next book
4,PoppyDone to Death,The continuation of a story in which I felt there were too many things going at once. Too confusing to the avg reader. I have read several series of Ms. Harris and find this one not as captivating as the Sookie Stackhouse series.
3,A little disappointing from Ms. Harris,"The Aurora Teagarden series is probably my least favorite series by Charlaine Harris. The Roe character just seems a little flat to me. However, these books are entertaining and ""Poppy Done to Death"" was an alright read. Like most of Ms. Harris's books, this was a quick read. I just wish that we had gotten to know the character that was killed a little better in the early books in the series. Especially since the character was Roe's step-sister-in-law. (This happens in the first chapter, so I'm not really spoiling anything. Not to mention it's on the synopsis on the back of the book). Roe is a likable character, even though she's a little flat."
3,Poppy done to death,I have read all of Charlaine Harris's books and this one lacked alot. Of all the Aurora Teagardens series this one was boring.
3,misleading photo,"I purchased this for my buick terraza van. I was disappointed by the item, mainly because of the photo. I was expecting one piece that would fit from door to door. Since it says a pair of 2, I thought I was getting 1 floormat for the 2nd row and one for the 3rd row. I got 2 pieces that you lay over each other for the one row. I guess that way it can fit multiple size vehicles. The floormats themselves are very heavy duty and do not slip. I still would have preferred one piece. We'll see how it goes once winter comes and we have more water, if it rolls under one of the pieces."
2,Misleading Photo,"I purchased this for my Toyota van. I was disappointed by the item, mainly because of the photo. I was expecting one piece that would fit from door to door. Since it says a pair of 2, I thought I was getting 1 floormat for the 2nd row and other for the 3rd row. I got 2 pieces that you lay over each other for the one row so I have buy more for the 3rd row which make it very pricey. The floormats themselves are heavy duty and do not slip. I still would have preferred one piece."
2,"Works, but very noisy after a year","We've had this fan for about a year. It still works well; however, within the last couple of months, it has begun to be very noisy for the first 15-20 minutes of operation. I just now looked for the company's website (hoping to find a copy of the little user manual I misplaced), but it seems to no longer have one (it use to be windchaserproducts.com)."
1,Not worth the money...,"This was my 2nd Windchaser purchase. The first one lasted a year and half before becoming progressively noisier by the day. It also quit working on low altogether and medium just barely made a breeze. I loved this fan so much up until its demise that it was worth it to me to purchase another one. BIG MISTAKE! I had the 2nd fan for only 2 weeks before it did the exact same thing as the first. There is obviously a manufacturing/design defect with this model that needs to addressed by the company that produces it. The only saving grace about this purchase was the company I bought it from. Even though I no longer had the original box the fan came in, the return was a breeze. Shop-O-Rama accepted the return, paid for the return shipping, and refunded by money immediately. Even though the fan didn't work out, I would definitely purchase another product from the is company."
3,Good Product - terrible customer service,"This was the 3rd fan we purchased from Livings. This first two are wonderful and working great. The third, however, stopped working within 30 days. I asked for a retrun for a defective product as I had replaced this in a hurry from a local store. Not only did they charge me a 15% restocking fee but I had to pay shipping on this defectived item!!!!! I questioned their decision and was told that was their offer. Will not purchase from Livings again!"
2,Very Noisy,The fan is very noisy and vibrates a lot when it is oscillating.Also I did not see any thermostat with the fan which I saw it one of the reviews for it.Also the customer service number does not work.Overall dissatisfied. Thinking of returning it
1,Princeton Support Stinks!,"I didn't buy this model...I brought the VL173 17 inch LCD monitor. It had a 1 year warrantee. 3 months after it went off warrantee, the monitor started exhibiting a one inch column of pulsing vertical banding. I called Princeton to see what I needed to do to repair it. They said the monitor was failing and there was nothing they could do. They won't work on any of their products that aren't covered anymore. They wouldn't make any suggestions as to what I should do. Just Adios and tough luck. I'll never purchase from this company again."
5,Works great,"I have a Lexar CompactFlash with the JumpShot cable and it works fantastic. Not once has it caused me any problems. Truly Plug-n-Play. I have an 8x card - and transfers are quite fast.One of the other reviewers mentioned that the JumpShot cable would not work with any other card. This is not entirely true. The cable will work only with USB Enabled CompactFlash cards. Not all cards are USB enabled. Watch for ""USB Enabled"" and you'll be OK. In my humble opinion, the JumpShot cable is fast, easy to use, and takes up little space."
1,"Data, no flavor","I can't imagine anyone using this book to choose a place to ski or to plan a trip. It has lots of data, but no flavor. You can get much better info from web sites themselves. A much better book is Ski Europe, by Charles Leocha, which in turn however is not as good as an out of print and out of date book called Abby Rand's Ski Guide to Europe. The book Good Skiing and Snowboarding Guide 1999 has more valuable info including trail maps, (although, in that book very few hotels and restaurants in each area are specified). Frankly, a great European ski travel guide has not been written recently, that I have found."
5,Marineland Cartridges,"Great price on something that I really need. Cheaper than buying in locally, and with more cartridges in the box"
5,Best Filters,I ordered these filters and I received them a few days after. Shiping was very fast and the quality of the peoduct is better than other filters I bought before. I also save a lot of money.
3,Filters clog too quickly,"I like the convenience and cost-effectiveness of buying the 6-packs of these filters on Amazon rather than buying 3-packs at the pet store. However, this type of Marineland filter gets clogged up waaaay too quickly. I wish I had chosen a different filter to begin with because now I'm stuck buying these unless I want to buy a whole new filter again."
3,Aquarium filter has same issues as any,"The blue pad gets clogged up rather quickly in my Penguin 100 Power Filter. The filter itself is wonderful. These little filter cartridges, on the other hand, do what all cartridges do. They clog up within a week or two in an established tank. However, if you rinse them out a bit in tank water when doing a water change, it helps a lot (you can get a month out of them easily this way). And if you are feeling particularly adventurous, some even use Marineland brand activated carbon to refill these bad boys. It takes a little touch and a pocket knife to slice open the top of the cartridge, but you CAN empty the carbon out, refill and reuse until the blue pad becomes too damaged."
1,Pitiful,I bought this book for .49 and they cancelled that is sorry !! they should not have the book listed if they dont have it in stock .!!!
1,Horrible service,I can't rate the book because it was never sent to us. We placed the order about a week ago and it has never been shipped. On the other hand we ordered the book yesterday from another place and it is on its way already. So I wouldn't recommend using these guys. I even sent them an email saying we needed it for school and never even received anything back.
3,Review of Barone's Dawn of Empire,"I enjoyed the setting of this work. It feels very much like anthropology in action--historical fiction on the rise of cities in Akkad. However, I can't give much praise to the writing itself. Barone's characters didn't thrill me, and his plot was to be expected. He tries hard with sex and violence, but that isn't enough to keep me interested.To be honest, I made this decision about 100 pages in, so I could be giving a harsher review than necessary. It may be worth 4/5. Give it a try.Also, I would agree this is a 'brave' book. There isn't much for mesopotamian historical fiction these days, so Barone didn't have many predecessors to consider, and couldn't guarantee a large reading audience."
2,Flawed,"This otherwise well written and interesting book would be better served had the author really researched and understood the times he was attempting to portray. Admittedly this is difficult when one goes back approximately 5000 years. However there are some verifiable facts such as coinage coming into existence only as early as 650 BC and the continuing reference to coins or money makes it impossible to plausibly immerse myself in the story, however well written. On of the reasons that I enjoy reading historical fiction is getting a feel for the times, and it is inaccuracies such as this that destroy the flavor."
3,If you've seen one siege . . .,"This novel is reasonably well paced and does not contain too much superfluous fluff. Nor does it suffer from the common problem of running out of steam towards the end--a common problem in many novels. Nevertheless, I was disappointed not to have learned anything about this era in history that I did not already know. The novel is mostly about a siege--perhaps the first in human history--but an unremarkable siege that seemed little different from other sieges that I have read about. Also, it seemed to me that the names of the characters did not sound like those from a semitic language like Akkadian.I did not get the feeling that I had been transported back to a distant era. In fact, the social fabric of the fortified city seemed very much like that of Chicago gangsters in the 1920's."
3,Dawn of Empire,"This was a historically interesting novel with detailed research behind it. It was, however, overly long and would have benefited from some editing. Worth reading, but too long."
4,Review,"An entertaining read. I liked it for the excellent job on recreating a period that I know little about. The story was believable and well paced. What was excellent for me was the little historical gems that were inserted as part of the story. For example on counting and math. It never occurred to me that math came about as an invention by farmers! The authors explanation made perfect sense though. As did the short section were the main male character learns about farming and how steppe tribes did a form of farming.The characters were believable and Trella, well I had forgotten how young women became women. Historically it is only recently that women have been able to avoid childbirth at an early age. What I thought was unnecessary was closing every chapter with them having sex. At that age most people are rabbits but it became tedious to read."
4,Awesome creature!,"This was not another particularly acclaimed episode, but it is one of my favorite. The crew are doing routine medical examinations on an archeological couple who only request salt tablets, presumably because of the hot climate of the planet. It turns out to be that Dr. McCoy's old girlfriend, who is part of the couple is actually a shape-shifting creature that has to feed off salt to survive, so it goes around killing crew members leaving red suction cup marks on their faces. The creatures true appearance is revealed near the end. Only complaint: it seems that the creature could not get enough salt no matter how many people it kept killing."
3,Interesting premise that fails to deliver,"This episode begins brilliantly. A woman appears differently to everyone that views her. Crewman wander away and end up as corpses. Why do Dr. Crater and his wife have such an unnatural craving for more salt?In spite of being reasonably entertaining, though, the episode settles into a humdrum story that fails to maintain the necessary suspense for an alleged horror story.There is some moralizing that would have been more effective if Captain Kirk had behaved according to the morals that this episode seems to be trying to convey. This isn't really a bad episode but it could have been so much more."
2,This episode gets a C- grade and is ranked 63rd out of 80,"The U.S.S. Enterprise arrives at planet M-113 to deliver supplies to Dr. Robert Crater and his wife, Nancy, whom Doctor Leonard McCoy was once romantically involved with. The Crater's have been on M-113 for five years conducting an archeological survey of the planet's ruins. They are the only known inhabitants of the planet. Crater tells Kirk that the only thing they need are salt tablets. Otherwise, they want to be left alone. Kirk debates this, insisting they must need other supplies and must at least allow McCoy to give them physicals. While this is happening, Darnell, one of Kirk's landing party, meets a beautiful young woman and wanders off with her. When Kirk goes looking for the young man, he finds him dead, his body scarred with suction cup shaped marks. The Captain orders the Craters to beam aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise."
4,"Good presentation, but has a few errors.","I have used this, and previous editions in my AutoCAD classes. Unfortunately, I have to switch texts because Lockhart has not updated this book for release 2000.The presentation is a bit weak in the area of drawing using surveyor measure, and ISOMETRIC drawing is omitted entirely. I use supplemental material for this. Many assignments have minor errors, and the chapter does not always proprly cover how to do the assignment. However, the sample problems are quite good and should interest the student.This book is well organized and takes the reader from the very beginning through 3-D drawing. Presentation style is easy to read, and the size of the book is nice to handle."
4,The Best Tutorial Book I have purchased since 1998,"Ms. Lockhart teaches at Montana State University when this Tutorial R.14 was written. I learned AutoCad from a small Trade school years after I got my Master of Architecture from Stanford. She recommend the usage of the R.14 to make a copy named ""Tutorial"" and download her date to learn the necessary steps to complete the items from her data as lessons. From this Tutorial, I found the missing links or the parts that I didn't understand full well a few years ago.I have seen her newer Tutorials on R.2000 and et al on Amazon, and I would not hesitate to any old pros or neophile who wants to understand better AutoCad."
2,"Excellent program selection, but overblown performances","This was a disapointment. After reading the list of songs included, I looked forward to hearing this CD. The instrumentalists are wonderful in interpretation and presentation, but the vocalists, though technically very good, seem overblown for these songs. Their performances border on the operatic, with just not the right amount of nuance for the repertoire. The soprano fares better than the male voices, but when there is a duet, they never seem to truly blend, but just compete with one another. I remember the great period recordings of Joan Morris and William Bolcolm, some of which are still available on CD(including a relatively new one- see Amazon for title and details), and this CD, though well-intentioned, never approaches that level of sophistication and purity of performance."
1,"Great Picture, WORST Quality","I purchased this unit, and it ran well for 500 hours. After that the ballast began to fail, just a few months out of 90-day warranty. Now it's at $600 doorstop. Many other people have had trouble with this projector dying on them; just google around a bit. Avoid this model, and cheap Infocus projectors for that matter!"
2,X1A is not an X1!,"In December 2002 I purchased an x1 (see my review under infocus x1) and this projector is still going strong and I love it. If you can find a used one, I would still definitely rcommend it. Note that if you are using it in a dusty area, you must clean the bulb filter about every six months (I blew the first bulb at a year by not doing this). However, I had a very different experience with the X1A. The composite video was never as good as the X1 which would seem to be because it has a different, inferior decoder. After a little more than a year it started making a loud buzzing noise and then it quit. Since I only had a 1 year warranty, I decided to just forget about it. I have since replaced it with a refurbished infocus 4805 which so far is working great and is reasonably quiet.Stay away from the X1A. I gave it 2 stars because for the year it did work it was excellent for playing DVD's from the computer."
4,bang for the money,I bought the X1a after much researching during thanks giving weekend (...)and I also bought the 3 year protection plan for $129.99 . I am satisfied with the quality of video i am watching through the projector. I live in an apartment complex and its bright during the day when i have to make the room dark but evenings and night excellent quality. it doesnt start up right away sometimes and i have to turn it off and on few times but that doesnt bother me much. I know its not great projector but for the cost its awesome. also if i get any of the problems the other reviewers have stated then i will be covered by warranty for 1 year by infocus and the following 3 years by officemax.

3,Not my kind of thing really,I was quite disappointed in this book - it was the first fiction of its kind I have ever read and sadly it lived up to all the negative stereotypes. The husband character in the book is such a cardboard-cut out villian the lesbian lover is a virtual saint. However the author has a real talent for making sex scenes erotic. Definitely a book for flicking through ...
2,Information needs to be updated,"Needs to be updated - many restaurants and suggested places have since closed. Even so, there is some useful information in the book."
1,"NOT a RELIANCE KIT....... Wanted 1/2"" Nipples...None","I needed JUST TWO 1/2"" Diaelectric Nipples ...as shown on Amazon reliance Kit 9000105, here in rural Nevada it was worth paying for extra (non needed pieces) to get item wanted ............. this kit does not state it is Reliance ..... no 1/2"" nipples were included ........still need nipples ...."
2,Only Two Players,"I bought this game because we play it all the time at our friends, it's the ultmate party game. You can have two couples playing, and change the difficulty level for each player. So everyone has a fair chance. We play it for hours on end. I bought this since it had Tetris inlcuded. However, from looking at the box, this version has support for only 2 players, instead of four. I was very dissapointed in that the 4 player tourney is what makes it so fun."
4,Emphasis on Relevance to Modern World,This book offers an overview of the Bible with an emphasis on its relevance to situations in the modern world. The beginning chapters are particularly useful to the newcomer to the Bible. Readers will be aided throughout by several maps and diagrams.The editor is an Anglican bishop. There are also thirty contributors from nine different countries.
1,refillable is useless,"When I first bought this I thought it was great to have a smaller spray bottle to cary in my purse or jacket pocket. Now that the refill bottle, that came with it, is empty the spray bottle is useless. I looked everywhere and can't find another non-spray bottle to refill it."
1,Not a kirby game!!!,"This is not a kirby game. It is another puzzle game like tetris but not as fun. It is exactly like a game i have on my computer called ""candy crisis"".... But kirby charecters unstead of candy falling down. What u do is match the objects up and try not to over flow the placement. It gives u two different objects at once and u make sure u match the things falling up to what is on the ground which u can move them over or turn them in different directions to match them. I like the original kirby on the nes so i tried this one and its just a puzzle game. I like all of the other kirby games better because they have a story."
3,Not as dynamic as others claimed,"It was a pleasent read, the writting is not great, the plot is interesting but very slow going. Overall, don't get your hopes up that this will be an awesome book ... it's only ""ok"". At times you'll struggle to want to con't."
2,Lower quality than expected,"I was disappointed in the quality of the book, The Color of Light, which was a book from the Marion County library. It is very worn and the cover is taped in three places. Some pages also are bent."
2,The Color Of Light,"I too found this book a little boring. If you read the first two chapters and then skip to the middle of the book, you can save yourself some time. I loved the end of the book. It kept me spellbound from one page to the next. I just wish the first half of the book could have done the same."
5,A gripping read,"Excellently written, with characters that grab the heart and leave you worrying about them after the light is turned out."
5,The Color of Light,"This is one of the best books I've read. I had never heard of the author, Karen White, before. She is very talented. The Color of Light kept my attention from beginning to end. Jillian had a troubled child hood which she was able to overcome with friends. This is a great book to read while sitting on the beach (or anywhere). I grabbed my Kindle and went down to a NC beach and read a big part of this book while sitting on the beach. It was great! I'm searching Amazon for more of Karen White's books."
4,Captivating,"This is a wonderful book. Has an interesting plot, and characters you will laugh and cry with. I read it for cover to cover in a day- I couldn't put it down. This is the first book I have read by this author, but it won't be the last!"
