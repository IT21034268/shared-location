2,knee pads for average size people,"I bought these knee pads for my son. The top strap has an adjustment for size, but the bottom strap is fixed and to short. This makes the gift unusable for a big man. There are better choices on the market. The price was cheap, and you get what you pay for."
1,Bad software,This scanner has probably good hardware but you can expect big problems with software. The colors of photos scanned from negative film depend on the other shots on the same strip. Unfortunately even if you tell the scanner not to use color correction it does it anyway. Scanning 20+ negs with 3200dpi takes more than 5 hours. It was more or less acceptable for me if I could expect normal result. Unfortunately it happens often that after hours of waiting you have to delete pictures with heavy blue cast and put strips into the scanner in another order and hope that it will work (sometimes it helps).I have asked from Canon customer care if there is another software or a way to configure this one somehow. They answered that I have to ask from Adobe. :-)
4,Nice Dress,"Claude Chabrol does not need to be compared to Alfred Hitchcock. His cinematic view of family obligation, obsession in everyday life, and clich√© rituals (such as weddings) stands on its own. Right before it totally creeps you out.The story of the good son, the good brother, the good guy who becomes an accomplice in the dark deeds of a bridesmaid who resembles Flora, Botticelli's goddess of Spring, begs the question: Which came first, his obsession or the object of his obsession? Chabrol's commentary is a must see, and an added bonus to the film."
3,intriguing idea,"While I agree with a lot of what the sarcastic reviewer below me wrote, I also think you can't expect Shakespeare from escapist fiction. Who cares about the minor unbelievability? It's a FANTASY novel. I liked the idea of the story, it kept my attention and I liked the fresh turn of it.(maybe I'm easily amused....so be it) There aren't many contemporary fantasies out. Sure, it had obvious holes that were filled rather lamely. So what. I doubt Ms. Fitch is going for the Nobel Prize in Literature. As the reviewer pointed out, a good writer leads the reader down the path of unbelievability. But so too does a good reader willingly follow that path. I gave this book 3 stars because it's not the best fantasy I've read, but it certainly isn't the worst. It's not a bad read."
3,"Decent price, slim on the fit","The price on these was right, but they were a very narrow fit, and my husband actually couldn't wear them. They were so inexpensive that we gave them to someone instead of paying the shipping to return them, but it was a little disappointing that they didn't fit. Guess that's why I rarely buy shoes or clothing online..."
3,No answer keys!,I like the structure of the book and how it guides you to learn the ecclesiastical Latin language. What irritates me is there are no answer keys at the end of each exercises. You don't know if you made a mistake or not. This will totally leave you in the dark. SED LUX LUCEAT IN TENEBRIS!!!
1,Worst Seller,"Yes, I recently ordered from them the album Turnaround by Westlife. It was fully packaged and everything. When i opened it up it was the album Allow Us To Be Frank by Westlife. It has been a couple of days since i messaged them with an error. And still no response. I am thoroughly disatisfied with this seller because they are not taking the time to fix their mistake. I better not be charged for shipping it back to them or having them ship a new one. It is entirely their fault and i want to paid in fully if they are going to refund my money or i want the correct disc if they are going to actually send me the correct album. Shop here if you want them to screw you over. I am pissed!!!"
5,Very Different,"This album's really different from Westlife's other albums. It's more uptempo but there still are quite a no. of their signature ballards!!!!.... anyway, my favourite songs on this album are: hey whatever, mandy, obvious, heal, i did it for you(nice lyrics... no wonder it was written by diane warren). thank you's nice too... turnaround's really quite of a turnaround for them. kinda funky which is so unlike Westlife but still good. This's cd's stuck in my cd player now... and i gurantee it'll be stuck on yours if you buy it...."
4,great cd,"I have been a Westlife fan for a couple of years. Another great album, they have changed their style trying out new songs. Each song is so unique. There are more up beat song in this albums compared to before. I have only listen to this album a couple of times. It's a little disappointing to found out that there are no songs that are completely moving like flying without wings, angel wing... westlife is known for their absolutely amazing ballads."
4,Give Us World of Our On and Coast to Coast Material!!!!,"While this album is good, it's not excellent, which is what we fans are used to. It was really nice to hear the remake of Mandy and be jealous of Britain getting to hear it on the radio. Also, there's no doubt that ""Obvious"" will be the next single, as it is by far the best song on the album. Heal is also good but kind of predictable. The uptempo songs just don't quite make it this time though. Hey Whatever is pretty good, but that's about it. Westlife is known for their ballads and that's what they do best. I realize a the guys wanted to try a new direction and though they didn't fail, it's not what they do best. World of Our Own and Coast to coast are still my favorites, but of course those albums will be hard to beat. But, it is Westlife and it is a good album."
1,"no hooks here! In fact, I'm lost.","I guess it's ""like 'em"" or ""hate 'em"" with Westlife. The problem is that I love most euro boybands. Their freshman album even had 1 or 2 strong tracks but this collection is weak. It has no hooks! Nothing sticks in my head. I guess they're going through the motions of song writing and tossing in a few poorly produced covers. Westlife may be forever scarred from the whipped cream to mouth sessions offered on auditions day by Ronan Keating. It's no wonder why close to no one in the USA has heard of them. My advice for 'the team' before any of these songs even got to the pre-production phase would have been, lose those industry knee pads you all wear and think for yourselves."
4,Realistic fun,"My students love Naylor's feisty series. The Malloy girls have recently moved to WV and now are plagued by the Hatfield brothers. The Halloween challenge is to come up with the better costumes. I think our school likes the believability of the books. They are not outlandish, but make anyone laugh as the brothers and sisters try to 'one-up' each other. You can read the episodes out of order, but what a fun series for an entire school year. Read The Boys against the Girls 10 book series for realistic fiction at its most ridiculous."
5,awsom book,"At the begging of the story they all went camping and the malloys girls mom made a choaclat cake and the boys got mad and throug the cake in the river.In the middle of the story the girls called peter in the house and gave him a snack and set down and they were trying to get peter to tell the girls what wally,jake,and josh was going to be in the Halloween parade.At the end of the story the brothers played a trick on the girls.I liked this story."
5,Restaurant Quality,"The first time I ever tried these, I was hooked. The products offered by Omaha Steaks are not only a value, they are all restaurant quality. In fact, I can honestly say that I have never eaten a better Cordon Bleu in any of the restaurants I have visited from California to New York.Once your taste buds are covered by the swiss cheese and chicken, I am confident you will be hooked as well."
3,Too small for my pad...,"I didn't realize that not all countoured changing pads are the same size. Mine that came with my changing table is 19 inches, where this cover is 16 inches. So, as many people are saying, this is way too small and makes the corners lift up. But it isn't the fault of the cover, I just bought the wrong one. For those of you like me who have a bigger pad, buy the Colgate Hi-Rise Contour Changer Pad Terry Cloth Cover. It has plenty of room, and it is much softer than this one. I bought it online, but they are available at baby specialty stores too."
2,An Unnecessary Item,"Of all the items I have received for my new baby. This is one I use the least. I originally put the cover on and yes, it looks nice but it is completely unnecessary. I would no longer get the cover on and I would have to take it off at the next diaper change because our little girl would wet on it. I don't know about anyone else, but I have enough laundry to do without having to add 3 changing covers a day to the load. I don't even use them anymore. They are more hassle than what it's worth. I do put one on if we are having company over just because it looks nice. Changing her on the bare pad is much easier. If she wets while I'm changing her diaper, I just wipe it right up and don't have to worry about washing yet another item."
5,Soft,I used this product while changing baby. Very soft and it always came clean in the laundry. Cheap and easy.
4,very nice cover,"I like this cover. I have it in many colors. My only deal with this not getting 5 stars is that they always seem to snag and little strings are hanging on it, however I just trim them off and it's no problem. They wash and dry great and last forever. I have used mine for 3 years +."
2,Bigger! Please! Bigger!,"I bought this for the mere fact that it would be nice and bright and keep the changing pad from being stained and make it last longer. I am having my first child and have not had the chance to use it yet, but I washed it first and when I went to put it on the pad it was WAY too small. I had to keep trying to stretch it out to make it fit on all the corners! The pad, which fit perfectly into the table, now has gotten two - three inches smaller on each side because this cover has smushed it to a new shape. Maybe make the cover a bigger size knowing that we as the consumers will wash it first and that way it will fit better. It still doesn't fit right but I can't take it back now! I have washed it. So be aware new/current mommies! Get a different brand or look for a bigger one!"
2,Cover shrunk and was rough after first wash,"I purchased a yellow one (from Babies R Us) and emerald green one (from Baby Depot). After using it a few times, I gave up. Recently, I started using them again (after 8 mths) because the vinyl covering is beginning to break up and is not comfortable for my son. I didnt like this for the following reasons:(a) it shrunk after the first wash and was difficult to fit nicely over the pad. it caused the pad to curl up.(b) it got rougher after each wash and fibrous strands started to stray;(c) no way to use the strap with the cover on.Also a tip, with the frequent pee bath my son gave us in the first few months, I needed to change the pad cover almost every time I changed his diaper. It was easier to use the changing pad without a cover because the vinyl sheet was much easier to clean up."
2,They shrink!,"You would think the covers would fit a changing pad made by the same manufacturer, but it doesn't. It shrunk the first time I washed it and now it doesn't fit the pad correctly. The corners of the pad's base are now bent from trying to fit this cover around it. Otherwise, I do like the fact that it is still soft after several washings. Also, as far as the slots for the straps, I guess it depends on what brand of changing pad you are using. The Simmons pad has straps that attach at the base and just come up over the side -- no need for special slots in the cover. But with my daughter we had a different pad that had the straps attached in a different place which would have required slots in order to use them. If you have one of those types of pads, this isn't the cover for you."
3,Confy but does not fit well,"They are very confortable for baby, but after you wash them, they shrink, even if you pay close attention to the directions!!! I am disappointed in Simmons. They could have made them a little larger knowing this."
4,Don't Buy Just One!,"If it had slits for the safety straps it would have gotten 5 stars. You need these for your changing pad and what a time saver. If there's an accident, just change the pad(perfect at night when all you want to do is go back to sleep).They're easy to get on and off. They wash up easily and I don't have any that have stained. They soak up any accidents without dripping or leaking. Get a couple and be prepared."
3,They shrink but they're still worth it!,"I agree with most of the other reviews. The colors are nice, it keeps the changing table warm and the material is soft but they SHRANK the very first time I washed them. I wash them in cold water and tumble dry low. I think they shrink a little more each time. Loose threads are also starting to come out. Now the covers cause the pad to curl up, but it's still better than having my son slide all over the changing pad on a towel or burp cloth."
3,"OK, but certainly not great.","The cover serves its purpose, but I wouldn't say its of outstanding quality. My son is 9 weeks old and I am rotating between two covers. The first thing I noticed was that the material is not soft. Like another reviewer found, it sort of feels like a cheap towels. I am also finding through frequent washings that the material is starting to fray around the elastic. And after only 9 weeks, I am sure I will be in the market for more covers soon."
1,Shrinks,"I read everyone's comment before buying, so I didn't think shrinkage would be a problem for me. I tried the cover on before washing. Little particles were falling all over the place. I read the directions about washing. I washed it in cold water. My mistake was probably putting it in the dryer. It said it was okay to dry. I don't know if hanging it to dry would have made a difference."
3,Wash in Cold Water only,"Unfortunately, the washing instructions are on the packaging, which most people thow away, and not the product. If you ever wash it in hot water, which is reasonable given its for changing diapers on, it will shrink so much it won't fit anymore. Otherwise, nice and soft, pretty bright colors, especially the Yellow and Green. Stay away from the Lavender as it starts to look gray after a few washes."
1,"Terrible- falls apart, not worth the money","We bought two of these changing pad covers. While the colors are pretty and the terry is soft, the cover was covered with pulls and runs in the cloth after only ONE washing. I was really disappointed with this product. Save your money- use a towel or an old pillowcase over your changing pad instead!"
5,Heaven Eyes,The book that I am reading is called Heaven Eyes. In this book it talks about a young girl named Erin Law and her two friends that live in a orphanage because their parents did not care for them. Their orphanage owner's name is Marlene. When they run away they meet another child named Heaven Eyes that can see everything. Heaven Eyes is what started it all.
3,"Good book, slow start, - but stay with it","This is a good book, but it took awhile for it to get to the good part. This book is about three orphans who build a raft and escape down a river and find themselves in a swamp. They meet a girl who is named Heaven Eyes. She helps them get around the ""Black Middens."" The most exciting part is when they are going on the raft ride to the ""Black Middens."" This book would be good for anyone who enjoys reading adventure books. If you like this book then you should read Aquila by David Almond."
5,EXCITEMENT AND DRAMA IN THIS READING!,"Gifted Broadway, film and television actress Amanda Plummer brings excitement and drama to her reading of this imaginative tale.Erin and January have run away from the children's home before; they're both adventuresome and brave for ones so young. But this escape takes a frightening turn when they find themselves afloat on a deep, dark river, carried by powerful currents until they find a one-of-a-kind girl called Heaven Eyes.Now, not only does Heaven Eyes have a strange appearance - webbed hands and feet - but, she apparently has the ability to help these children find their place in the world.This is a story of courage, confidence, and comradery, a haunting narrative not easily forgotten."
3,a good book,"i enjoyed this book, however, parts of the book made me a bit bored. when 3 kids and a mouse 'runaway,' downstream, their raft gets stuck and they meet Heaven Eyes and her grandfather. as the author, maybe David Almond could have cut certain bis and added something a bit more exciting."
5,A pretty great introduction to the sound of the guimbarde.,"This is really, really fantastic. There's a lot of traditional music on various guimbardes from around the world, as the title suggests. There's also a little bit of throat singing, as well as some more modern and unusual compositions by Tran Quang Hai. I'd highly recommend this to anyone interested in the guimbarde, Vietnamese music, or throat singing."
1,Don't waste your money,"I have been to a Finkel and Conti seminar and have read this book. Fortunetaly, I did not pay for the book. They provide no useful information, and promote practices which can be considered highly unethical. I am a real estate agent and a full time investor. If you really want to be an investor, buy ONE book, find someone who is already actively investing, and learn from them."
1,NO value. Buyer be aware!,"The book is definitely nicely dressed, but now I have no faith in its value. Lots of false reviews...Buyer be aware"
2,"In theory works, but reality is difficult","Many of the techniques are working on paper, but the reality is not so easy. It seems to me the easier way how to make money in real estate investing is writing book like this."
5,"Intelligent, open-minded readers only!","In response to the reviewer from Florida (who did not list his name and take responsibility for his ignorant remarks):I have met the author of this book, attended his seminars, and read his previous book, as well as this current one. The techniques described in detail ARE viable and REAL INVESTORS are making a living with them, myself being one of them. You only have a real estate license, which has handicapped you to thinking creatively about real estate investing. Leave the real investing to people like myself who are intelligent, creative, and hard-working enough to implement the book's strategies. My advice to you is to stick to selling houses in the traditional manner. To all others, read this book. The information will help you become even more successful in your real estate investing endeavors."
2,Great Fiction,"The authors are among the most skillful *marketers* I've seen - I'm unsure about their real estate competence. I've received emails hyping this book for several weeks through their mailing list, and I'm sure book sales reflect these tactics. Overall the book is well-written and easy to read. The success stories are highly motivational, but I don't believe the average investor should bet the farm on this method. The book is entertaining, but not a foundation to build a long-term investment plan upon."
1,Highly unethical - scary there are people supporting it...,"I am not a real estate agent, but a beginning investor (no real experience yet, just getting educated and ready). This book leaves such a bad taste in the mouth: win-win situation looks like conning the seller out of property and money using their desperate need to sell. Of course, at all times there exist business people and mauroders, and they both become rich, but in a very different way. I don't believe in become-a-millionaire-in-1-year plans. Thank you, guys, who leave honest feedback. Sorry for those who prefer schemes."
1,Stay away from Peter Conti,As other reviews have said that the author does not spell out the specific language needed for deals. That is because they want you to sign up for their Real Estate Seminars. Stay away from Peter Conti and his company. I have had a very bad experience with them and do not recommend.
4,Making Big Money Investing In Real Estate:,Peter and David are Real Estate professionals helping out the others. This was a good follow-up book. I highly recommend their other book: How To Create Multiple Streams Of Income.Both books are clear and concise. Several examples help clear each step towards the Lease Option. Win-Win all the way.
5,Real Estate Investment,Very informative and easy to read information. Good job on research and the materials revieled.
1,Shark Infested Waters,"Know who you're dealing with here. There are all kinds of people in the real estate business, and then there are sharks....In terms of the book itself, some of the tactics here are simply unethical. Much of the book relies on owner-financed deals. In order to get the owners to accept below market interest rates, the authors suggest labeling the payments ""thank you payments"" instead of interest. ""Just by labeling the payment this way you de-emphasize the need to get an interest rate"" (p. 103). Lessons in how to deceive and swindle, sweet dreams.They also suggest you push for a same day decision on any property. By all means, don't let the owners sleep on it, they might come to their senses!These are nasty people, every book has some good ideas somewhere, but this one was too nauseating to wade through looking for them."
4,Good read with an interesting perspective,"The ideas presented in the book are creative and great ways for people to make money in real estate without following the ""traditional"" system. The real world examples and processes are what make this a great read and a beneficial book. The only negative review of the book that I've read comes from a Real Estate agent which makes sense considering the mental box that most, but not all, real estate agents are in. The book empowers people to make it on their own through knowledge."
1,"To good reviews, Thank You for stopping me!","After looking at the good and bad reviews,I see this book is a set up. Thank you for telling me the truth, those who told the reality of this book and where the 5 star reviews came from. I am to get a call from these guys this morning. I may just let it ring."
3,Going to try to make it work!,"I got the book about a week ago. I have read it a couple of times and taking a few notes. It was an easy read.My goal is to have my first property in 3-4 months. The reason I picked so far out as a goal is because I have a new 4 mo. old daughter. Otherwise I probably would have said a month and a half... I will right back and let you know how it is going...On another note about all the reviews... It seems to me that all the students did 5 outta 5 stars and anyone who either hasn't read it or been able to buy any property gave the book a 1 star. It seems to me people who have not, at the very least, read the book, should not comment on the book... Ranting does not help anything. Anyway, like I said, I'll let you know how it goes... I'll write back in a month..."
3,There is no book so bad that does not have something of value in it,"Too few quotations, too many trivial quotations not enough deep and meaningful quotations from the religious sources. These three faults define this small book, nonetheless does have some quotations of interest, humor and value. But there are many other Jewish quotation collections which are far superior. Consider for instance the Hertz collection of 'Jewish Thoughts' or in more recent times Jessica Gribetz's book of Jewish Wisdom."
1,Very poor content,Don't buy this item. Very very poor quality. Only couple of pharases in each page. I regret ordering this book.
2,SENSOR DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD DESCRIPTION,"When you buy this sensor be aware of what you need, this sensor is not the one that goes on the top of the Motor, This product needs more description so you can know what are you really buying."
4,Good CD; LP is better.,"These recordings are from around 1946, before tape became the norm. They were recorded live directly onto wax discs, transferred to a metal master and then pressed into 78-rpm discs. So the 78s (in case the metal masters are lost) ARE the actual masters.When you hear pop and crackle on such recordings, it's usually a sign that the label is doing something right by not sucking out all of the life out of the recording by trying to reduce surface noise, which is still not possible today without harming the music. Technicalities aside, this disc is wonderful. But if you get a chance, grad the LP version instead, since it has more tracks and the liner notes are at a size where you can actually read them."
1,snap crackle pop,It is apparent from the samples that the songs were taken either from 78's or a copy of the original savoy Lp or both and not from masters. It sounds worse than my LP at home. What a SHAME because the music is great.
5,Excellent Reading,The stories and accounts in this 4 book volume are compelling. Better than what anyone could surmise with what really happened. View points from which the stories are told are something you won't get in history books.
5,THE ROOTS OF R'n'B - A MUST- like no other<<<,"Big Maybelle had a blistering delivery- matched by no one then or now. A must for any 1950s rhythm and blues fan, she could belt it out and tear it up and yet be sensitive. Check out her only film appearance in ""Jazz on a Summer's Day"" 1958 Newport Jazz festival. A shame no live recording was ever waxed. A truly unique performer whose life was tragically cut short, passing away in the early 1970s. ""Pitiful"" is one of my faves."
5,Silicone Grease,I needed this Silicone Grease to install a RV water pump. When I finally got it (I am out of the US and it had to be forwarded) it worked well.
2,Not a Toy It's Silicone Grease,"The grease worked very well for my RV application. I have one issue, the pIcture of the tube is misleading. No where did the. Amazon ad state the contents wt. or volume. When I got the grease it was in a small tube containing about 5 grams. Very small indeed. Oh, the label on the tube did not specify net contents as well."
1,Very Inaccurate,Very inaccurate on ME (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis aka CFS/CFIDS). ME is a common (1M+ in US) and extremely debilitating NeuroEndocrine Immune Disease. They conflate ME (CFS) and idiopathic chronic fatigue and say ME is just a euphamism for depression. Shameful.
3,Only good for slicing and thick fry sticks,"If you only want to make simple slices of the vegetable and thick straight potato fry sticks, this device works well. But it cannot make thin shreds, nor curved slices or fries. Another thing is its plastic surface get stained by food color, such as carrot color. Soap water cannot clean the stains."
3,Handle with Care,Product works well but is dangerous. Is very difficult to open and close. Blade is where lock is.
2,Disappointed in product,I wasn't that impressed with this mandoline. I have a cheaper model that seems to work better. Was disappointed in the item.
2,If it's so sharp then why....?,"This is replacing an old mandoline that worked well but was getting old and rusty. The old one actually works better than this.I really have to shove the vegetables through to cut them. It really shouldn't require the excertion I'm needing to use. If it's so sharp, WHY must I shove so hard? It seems like the potato, onion, or whatever gets stuck halfway thru the slice consistently. I'm wondering if this is what causes people to slip and cut their fingers. It's a little frightening. I'm dissapointed to say the least.Other than that, I think the product is fine. Once you've used it a few times, you remember how to open it and use the options.Not ready to toss my old one just yet though! Haven't given up on this one yet, hopefully I don't lose a digit before that happens."
3,Good but not great,I purchased this to specifically slice sweet potatoes to dehydrate them for my dog. The slicer does an ok job of that. I also have difficulty opening it from the closed position and am always afraid I am going to crack it.
3,Good for slicing,"Good basic product. I use it when slicing potatoes mostly since I generally have to slice more than one, but otherwise not worth the trouble to set up. I would recommend it."
4,Almost Perfect,"This would be the perfect, inexpensive, well designed mandoline if only the rotating/hidden bar on the bottom held more than a french fry slicer. Maybe I'm expecting too much but... they almost made it to the perfect mandoline. There's no narrower blade than the french fy slicer so you can't do narrower julliennes or the 'basket weave' pattern for potatoes and other hard veggies. If you're only looking for quick, uniform slicing and french fy (1/4"") size julliennes, this mandoline is definitely for you. It's well made, works great and is priced really low. Go for it!"
3,Does the job,First of all I want to say that I have no other experience w/ this type of a product. Trying to use the julienne blades to cut french fries takes some upperbody strength and I felt like the base was flexing when I tried to push down on the potato. But I have also used it to slice yellow squash and zucchini and it works like a dream. I love that everything is uniform in thickness which makes it easy to cook evenly. Also a big advantage is tossing it in the dishwasher for clean up & being able to fold it away to store.
4,Easy to use mandoline.,"This mandoline, like most, is really sharp. Do yourself a favor - always use the guard that protects your fingers from the blade. As I was slicing a tomato without the guard, and thinking to myself, ""..this probably isn't a real good idea,"" I took a slice off the end of my thumb the other day! The plastic is very high quality - and dishwasher safe! A really good buy."
3,"Order the Easy Slice, not the Easy Slice 2","Amazon has both an Easy Slice and an Easy Slice 2 on the site. I assumed the ""2"" was a more recent model, so I ordered it. I received the Easy Slice, not the ""2"". Contact the seller, who states that the products are identical. Apparently, there is no ""2"", just the Easy Slice. Since the Easy Slice is cheaper and has free shipping, order that, don't order the non-existent Easy Slice 2.That said, the product is great. Well made, works like a champ. Very happy with the purchase. So I would give 5 stars to the Easy Slice."
5,love this cd,its just good. ive lost or had my cd stolen 4 times now.but its worth bying again.so i do.
2,Buy only if have spare $20 and passionate about the game,"Poorly constructed guide. On the one hand, it has all the basics you might expect; character development details, zone details, and enemy details. They also include some useful tips and a whole chapter on why copying trademark characters is bad taste (hey its they're book, there allowed the occasional tangent).However it was way too obvious that each power, as well as some of the enemies, was researched by different authors. You may be reading about one power for an archetype that is described well, turn the page to the next power and find it poorly described. In addition they have obvious errors in the book. For example they mention a supergroup vault, which COH designers have told me directly doesn't exist.All in all, this is book was obviously slapped together much like a frat kids research paper. Shameful for a proffesional game guide company."
3,Buy the Ring-Binder version! It is more up-to-date!,"After owning the paper-back original version of this guide for COH, I bought the ring-bound version. The ring-bound version is up-to-date through Issue #6 and it is in a totally different printed format than the paperback version. It is also designed differently and probably has much better information in it since it was created well after the game had been out for a long while. Go for the ring-bound version if you want more current information. The paper-back version is good for starting, and most of its basic strategies and concepts will help you design a good character with good powers."
1,A complete waste of resources,"Sadly, this book was outdated and inapplicable the day it hit the stands. Repeated changes to the City of Heroes interface, infrastructure and gameplay have moved the game so far away from this book it often seems to be discussing an entirely different game. In many ways, it is.If you're looking for a quick start guide, strategy guide, or even just a collection of helpful hints, this is NOT the book you want."
2,Strategy guides,"Guide is ok in dealing with chara building and development, but quite a few errors. The maps were great as were the few tips they gave for tactics.Little disappointed no badge listing or how to get them. Only buy guide if you want a little more info on game."
3,Game guide for City of Heros,Not the most up to date information but still helpfull for a beginner with no manuel.
2,An interested observer,This book is not quite what I thought it was - it gives me information that I already have but not the help that I need. I have been interested in homeopathy for years and have used it to some degree - I'll keep looking for more info.
3,A BOOK THAT GIVES JUST A LITTLE STEP...,"VITHOULKAS IS NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR, AND HE MAYBE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE ORGANON AS IT IS. ANY WAY ONE CAN READ A BOOK LIKE THIS BUT IF ONE PERSON IS A HOMEOPATHIST DOES NOT NEED IT, THE ORGANON IS ENOUGHT...I READ EVERY THING FROM VITHOULKAS AND THINK HE IS VERY IMAGINATIVE, BUT THAT IS NOT THE EVERY DAY JOB OF A DOCTOR."
5,The philosophy of classical homeopathy.,"It has been well said that to learn things right you must study from the Masters. This book is written on the philosophy and orthodox practice of homeopathy (h/p) by the living master of classical h/p, George Vithoulkas.It is a complete book that puts homeopathy in the right context from the beginning. It teaches the virtue of finding the correct remedy and practicing patience and restrain rather than the ""fast food"" approach to h/p common today.While it is targeted to the prescriber (or student of h/p) it is highly recommended for the educated 'patient' who wants a rounded understanding on the subject. Furthermore, Appendix B is worth the whole price of the book.This is a book of substance. You may read it overnight like many books but what is important, this is a book to read three times and still come back to it."
5,A modern day classic of Homeopathy.. required reading,"This textbook of the Science of Homeopathy is required reading in all Homeopathic educational programs I know of. George Vithoulkas, one of THE foremost modern homeopaths, clearly explains the HOW and WHY of homeopathic cure, and details the steps in beginning to learn and to practice homeopathy, the Medicine of the twenty-first century."
4,Mistral's women,"Julien Mistral is a painter with great passion for his work. He also has passion for three generations of Lunel women, two of whom are his mistresses and one who is his daughter. With Mistral, nothing can come between him and his work and this obsession, coupled with fateful occurences in the lives of the Lunels is the foundation on which this book is written. Krantz has a way of creating characters which the reader cares about and putting them into situations where their flawed human nature causes many complications in their lives. This book takes the reader behind the scenes of the art and fashion worlds of France and New York, and tells an engrossing and interesting tale. It's a good read!"
2,Not for Me,I found it kind of creepy that all the women in this book have almost a compulsive urge to sleep with this man.To top it all of he's kind of a jerk all the way around.If this didn't have Krantz's name on it I'd assume it was written by a very juvenile male.
3,Disappointing but still good.,"Judith Krantz has written ten books, and out of those I've read six. This is one of those six, and while I enjoyed reading it, I still wish it was better.This is the story of a successful painter, Julien Mistral, and his relationships with three women in the span of about 50 years. Maggy Lunel is one of his first nude models, and they share a brief fling. Teddy Lunel is Maggy's daughter from another man, who becomes a big model, falls in love with Mistral and gives birth to his child. Fauve, Teddy and Julien Mistral's daughter, is an aspiring painter like her father, but eventually learns an upsetting fact about her father that forever changes their relationship. This novel, never like any Judith Krantz before or after it, rambles on forever about nothing in particular, and it is very hard to feel you know most of the characters, let alone really care what happens to them. Read it because it's Judith Krantz, but it is by no means her best work."
1,Hair gel,"I was very upset to open the packaging box to find the product spill everywhere,I'm very disappointed,I felt as if they could have put a little more effort !!!!!!!!!!:-("
4,Rejetting Your Carbs.,My Honda Shadow Sabre Was Never Rejetted After Having The OEM Exhaust Replaced But The Bike Came From Altitude Of Albuquerque To Low Austin And Then The Fuel Was Just Too Lean To Adjust The Popping Out The Exhaust By Carb Adjustment Only. These Main Jets Helped Some But I Still Had To Go Back Into The Carbs And Put In One Size Larger Slow Jets And Then My Problem Was Cured.
5,Did the trick,"Bike had a bad miss when accelerating. Changing the carb air screws would change the range of the miss. Installed this kit, turned carb air screws 3.5 turns out. Runs better than ever."
2,Dull and pedestrian,"Alas, John Cleese, the star of this show, misses the mark here, and Sarah Badel, as Katherine, is not only too old for the part but plays her less as a shrew than an alternately abused or abusive mental patient. Perhaps it's her ""advanced"" age, but I'd never imagined Kate crying, and this mature woman in tears does not advance the comedy. In my opinion, the best Shrew out there is the 1976 TV version, still available on Amazon, starring Marc Singer of ""Beastmaster"" fame. It's athletic, bawdy, energetic -- and funny!"
4,Easy Shakespeare,Jonathon Miller is a master in bringing highly talented actors together to perform in a serious role. John Cleese is like no other Petruchio and my favourite.I had seen this production on BBC in 1987 and loved it. When I finally tracked it down on Amazon I was thrilled. Watching it again after so many years is always a risk but I wasn't disappointed. Even my reluctant daughter (24) enjoyed it too. A gem!
5,Best version ever,"John Cleese in The Taming of the Shrew?!!!That was my reaction, too. But I couldn't resist tuning in, and boy was I glad I did. I enjoyed Richard Burton's version and considered it the definitive take on Petruchio -- until I saw Cleese's. Simply magnificent. That acid wit of his was the perfect tool for taming Kate. Highly recommended."
3,I didn't enjoy this version,"It was dull and mirthless. But I added two stars, one as a tribute to Shakespear's great play, and another to say thank you to Amazon for refunding my money without having asked for it when my old computer messed up my reception. Now that's classy service."
2,size matters,this product is much wider than it appears. - probably would not purchase this type of item again without having all the dimensions.
2,Should have trustd some of the reviews I read,I really should have paid attention to some of the reviews on this product. The odor is absolutely horrid and was left behind on everything it came in contact with. It was so bad I had to toss it in the trash.
2,I don't like the smell,like the size but don't like the smell. it's kinda strong chemical smell and will not go away after many washing...
3,A tad to big,"My wife was very excited to try this one, but over all was disappointed. The rubbery feel and smell are a turn off, as others have noted. You have to use a lot of lube or it snags on the way in. She liked the length and was able to easily use it with both hands or one hand. Excellent for deep penetration but the rubbery texture pulls her pubic hair. Also felt it was just a bit to big around for comfort vaginally, but for anal fun it really does the job. We still use it regularly, but it's not the first toy she reaches for."
5,Cool Jazz never got cooler,This is the apex of cool. Milt Jackson and Frank Wess - vibes and flute are a natural fit and no instruments are cooler than the flute and vibes in the hands of masters. The sad part is the CD is way too short. But if you want a real study of the flute in jazz couple this with Heavy Flute - the cool and the hot. Your CD player will never sound better.
4,Good info,"The book has some good information, although I feel its more general PR topics and not really focused on nonprofit."
2,Too small - doesn't fit 1999 Toyota Tacoma,"The mirror is too small for the driver's side mirror assembly on a '99 toyota tacoma (4 cyl 4wd). The retaining ring is only able to hold one of the 4 edges. The other three sides all have a fairly large gap. It needs to be at least 1/8 or 3/16"" taller and wider. Basically a complete fail. Otherwise it seems fine, though I haven't used it yet because I'm not going to drive around with it unsecured like that."
4,"Good as a tutorial, good as a reference..","Complete, detailed, easy to read and understand, this book should be shipped with every copy of Websphere Server. The best money I've spent on a technical book in years. If you are developing applications with Websphere, you should own a copy of this book. It clearly explains how to exploit J2EE technologies in your application architecture, as well as how to take advantage of the features of Websphere Server. Invaluable as a learning guide or as a reference."
2,Poor Reference,"I am glad others found the book useful. I found it nearly worhtless although I was pleased with the WSAD 4 coverage. However, explanations are minimal and trying to deploy your first app to WebSphere 4 using this book was a waste. After reading and re-reading everything it said, we still had no success so we just dug in, trial and error, several days and finally got it. Discussions on virtual hosts offered us nothing but a few descriptions that only make sense after you understand what a virtual host is. With paragraph after paragraph labeled understanding, I would have thought some would have been imparted - we needed quick understanding in a real project and the way things are today, we needed it fast. The book gets rarely referenced by myself. There is just not enough in depth explanation to save one from the school of ""hard knocks"". A student, with time may get some value as an introduction but overall I was disappointed."
2,Useless for the newbies,"I bought this book because it was marketed as a guide for the beginners and intermediates. Lie.I needed to learn websphere for my job, so after the first few chapters I had to stop because the thing started to fly way over my head. All I needed was something to explain me the basics and the most common architecture and mechanics.This book doesn't do that. Maybe if you are a veteran with Websphere, this might be good, but if you are looking for something to get you started, stay away from this book."
4,Had what I needed,"I recently started a job that is using WAS for their application server. I needed a reference book to help jump start me, and I felt this book did a great job. It covers the install and admin pieces quite well, and I am beginning to go through the development sections. I like the fact that they have a lot of code examples and an overall running project example. I get alot of use from looking at actual working code. The book does use the WSAD(WebSphere Studio Application Developer) tool to illustrate the examples, but I just used my favorite editor and Javac with out any problems. Overall this book explained well the things I needed to know and I would recommend it to others."
1,MANY WAYS TO GOD?,"David Schiller may think that there are a million ways to God but God sais there is only one. I wonder what the use of Jesus sacrifice was if one can enter heaven through Allah or Buddah. None.And that is because there is no other way to eternal life exept through Jesus Christ. This book can only lead a person away from the truth and into deception. Jesus died to take our sins away so that we can come clean before God and so that when God sees us He will see Jesus in us, thus giving us the right to enter heaven without blemish. Believe in Jesus and you shall be saved. God bless you."
4,Couldn't help myself,My 2nd grader grandson checked this out from his library and began reading me one of the stories while we were driving. We talked about the book and his opinion of it. He loved it! and I liked the story that he had read. Our library didn't have anything like it so I couldn't help myself...I bought it! NOTE: It is out of print.
5,A fantasic faith builder-Power over is evil is found in God!,"This is a great story, wonderfully told. I especially enjoyed the section that exemplified the power of God over evil: speaking the word of God rather than relying on mere human strength or devices. It reminds me of the Bible scripture, "" Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord."" It was very inspirational!"
3,It is OK book,"I didnt finish the book yet, but some parts are very interesting. While i was first one hundread pages it was pretty excting, but I got bored after about a hundread pages after. Somepart are fun even after hundread pages but it wasn't that fun. It's OK book."
4,Definitely worth your time,"Classic Lawhead, this book explores a more personal conflict that many will relate to: that of truth, trust, and betrayal. Grail demonstrates Lawhead's personal spiritual position, which brings some to fear and disgust. Yet do not attempt to read beyond the ""Christian"" theme, for that is exactly what the author wishes us NOT to do. Gwalchalvad is you and me. He battles ultimately with the question of to whom he should submit. His passions and lust? His friends? His Pendragon? His God?The adventure is fast paced, do not doubt that. The new perspective of a new narrator is refreshing. Lawhead will break your heart, make you jump for joy, make you hate the villain, and love the victor. That's what fantasy should be about. We all can find ourselves in one of the characters of this book. The question we must ask is, which one am I?"
1,Short book title and short attention span.,"I look back at the time I spent reading this book and ask myself why I wasted three weeks of my life attempting to read and contemplate the text within this fragment of harolded literary masterpieces. Again, like others, I too have felt the uncontrolable urge to jump out of my bed in wild abandon and toss this book into my natural gas fireplace and watch each page sizzle into ashes. I seriously could never stay awake long enough to go through 5 pages in one night, so I had to read it in the daytime. Overall, the book is much, much too boring and I could never go through with reading it again for my fat English teacher."
2,not as good as the others,i found myself very bored and i couldn't finish it. then a year later i read some more (a couple pages) and still couldn't finish it. it now sits on my shelf with a bookmark in the middle.
1,not worth the time,"i've read all the pendragon books. but when i think about them i can only remember the story up to the middle of the Aurther book, the rest is just a blur. WHEN I TRIED to read this book i found myself getting side-tracked,(for long periods of time i would just sit there and stare at the pages, or the wall), this book is really boring. After 2 years i'm on page 45 or 50 or something. And i can't stand the christian theme. i don't beleive in god so i can't relate to this book."
4,Answer to Great monitor,"Hello I would like to ask ""kq6yi"". I have baught a NEOVO F-419, it's a tromandus monitor with a very good brightness and contrast, the picture is very fine respond time tends to be good (25ms) though it isn't best, but I have found no 19inch screen with a better respond time, 25ms is the best at present times for 19"" TFT screens.There's just a thing and taht's why I would like to ask ""kq6yi"", it's that there is a defective (I think) sub-pixel which turns out to be red/blue. BUT on my contract with Neovo there must be at least 4 defective pixels to be considered as defective!! so I think I can't bring it back to the shop and I was wondering how you got a replacment...Thanks a lot.In other ways, AG neovo tends out to be VERY food screens with very atracive prices."
3,review from the Synthesis,"This full-length debut from Sparrow reveals Jason Zumpano (formerly of the Sub Pop band Zumpano) continuing an interest in crafting lush but straightforward power pop. And while the effort is sometimes fresh and infectious, recalling a younger Ben Folds with its sweetly whine-tinged vocals and piano-driven melodies, The Early Years is also a very uneven record, merely dotted with an occasional powerful, heart-stopping hook (the kind that merits listening at all). The title track itself is the strongest here, revealing a layered emotional urgency with its beautifully harmonized vocals and an inspired intertwining of a quick, pulsating violin and drumbeat. Unfortunately, many of the other songs fall somewhat flat, sounding so conventional with their plentiful oohs and ahs, and repetitive choruses that they become familiar enough to ignore.- Willow ElizabethSynthesis.net"
5,Excellent Service,"My order process was professional. I recievied my order within the estimated time frame stated, it was in excellent condition."
2,Ummmm,"I do not know what material this is made of, but it left intense burning. Can only be used wit a condom. I would not recommend this brand!"
3,Beware - no PC Fax capability,"Although this is a multifunction Printer/Fax, there is no provision for faxing direct from the PC. You have to print, then fax the paper document. Ridiculous oversight."
3,Good Information,This is a good book for Law ENFORCEMENT families and will help you get started on the right path in your work life and relationship.
4,good for the family,Bought this book for my wife. She told me that it really explained things to her. Like why it is that I would come home and go for a walk by my self or why I would want to watch a funny show and not talk for a bit so I could unwind. She said that it would really help with my family members also. Help them understand the working 12hr shifts and nights compared to days ect.
1,Not what I expected,"The book I love a cop , was a good title for the book if it was for a spouse of a married cop, but it didn't reaLLY COVER WHAT i EXPECTED , being married to a cop I look for soources that will help me and in this book there was alot of jibber jabber that I wasn't intersted in reading for that reason I'm sending it back . 3 stars to the title which was for me was what made me want to buy it, but don't waste your time unless you and your husband are cops."
4,Good book for those who are married or planning,Myself and my girlfriend have both read this book. Gives interesting insight to the lives of Police families. recommend for anyone
2,Not worth it,"This is a big book, and is laced with the pseudo-intellectual psycho-babble that makes many psychologists seem like they know something. Think again. I should have bought The Badge by Jim Geeting before this book, to get a better understanding at police work or to share with my family about how police life. There's plenty of studies and statistics but really no substances when this book is boiled down.I would skim it if you knew someone with a copy, just so you see what I mean."
1,Worst book on police work ever,"As a former LEO, I expected a good read. But this book is just a pile of garbage. The author knows NOTHING about police work. Unbelievably bad. A waste of time and money."
1,Very dissappointed,I expected more from this book. All it is is excusses for bad behavior expecting families to just accept them.
3,"Ok, but not her best work.","This was an ok story that Ms Small told us but it seemed to me that she was trying to capture the essence of Skye O'Malley in this story. I really enjoyed the Skye O'Malley saga but there is only one Skye and I'd like to see a little more originality. I don't want this to come off as a really negative review because I do have the greatest respect for Ms. Small and throughly appreciate her work. I absolutely have all her works listed in her books as former titles and will continue to patronize her work, I feel her work is always of that quality. This book just didn't hold me captive as her others have."
4,Pretty Darn Good!,"I have always been a huge fan of Bertrice Small, but her last few books had been very disappointing. Betrayed is the best one she's written in a while. The only thing I didn't care for was that Fiona spent so much time apart from Angus. But I was glad to see that at least Fiona didn't end up in some damn harem, because I was getting pretty sick of that same old story in too many of Bertrice Smalls books! Betrayed is worth a read."
1,Disgusting.,"This was a sad excuse for gratuitous sex. Almost zero plot, a young girl sleeps with two men she 'loves' in dozens of places, positions and situations. They may have had their clothes on for maybe 1/2 of the book. Maybe. All in all, a waste of time."
2,Who Cares About These People?,"It started out all right, but soon plunged into long stretches of dry historical facts that read like ""Robert, Duke of Albany, brother of late king Robert III, held hostage by his nephew, Murdoch Earl of Fife, who murdered the last English king, who chose a bride--""Soon I stopped caring who anyone was, or attempting to keep track of them. The plotting was choppy with no vitality or momentum, the narrative pedestrian and unimaginative -- and, come to think of it, isn't ""imaginative narrative"" one of the top goals for a writer? All the characters are cardboard-thin, and the narrative point of view skipped all over the place; sometimes you're reading three different character's thoughts on the same page!And the main plot point, the kind sending Fiona to be a spy...Why didn't he just get someone who was WILLING to do it???Well, that's where I stopped reading, so unfortunately didn't get to the ""gratuitous sex"" parts I heard mention of."
1,Not worth the time and effort!,"Written under the genre of historical romance, this tale could better have been listed as adult. The basic plot of a highland lass, only fifteen years old, finding true love simultaneously with two men is a sheer cover for the unending, gratuitous, raunchy bedroom scenes.Although descriptions of lush landscapes are well-written, the characters aren't dressed long enough to enjoy them and the only emotions portrayed are lust and jeaslousy.For a good Scottish romance, look elsewhere - try Jude Devereaux or Julie Garwood!"
1,The grammar and spelling is horrible in the kindle edition,"The book itself is typical Beatrice Small. A great story set in historical fact. HOWEVER, the kindle edition is so laden with mis-spellings and poor punctuation, that it is very distracting for the reader. I would recommend getting this book in the paper version."
4,"Very good but, would I have liked a little more adventure.","I think she did a great great job. I think the story could have been a little longer. I would like to have found out what the King thought of them getting married and the deception he played on them. All in all Bertrice always delivers a good, juicy, and spicy story."
5,Another Great Book for Ms.Small!,"The story is fast-paced, never a dull moment anywhere in the book.It is very descriptive, which helps to transport you to that time period. I finished it in 3 days. A truly enjoyable read!"
2,Chris Buckley's publishers made him do it,"I am normally a huge Christopher Buckley fan, and I was excited to get Wry Martinis. I knew it was a collection of (largely) previously published work, but why should that matter? Unfortunately, it turns out to matter a lot. Buckley's magazine pieces would no doubt be funny if you came upon them one at a time in a magazine, just the way Andy Rooney could be funny at the end of a 60 Minutes broadcast. Strung end-to-end, however, these short essays just become irritating. Here's one thing Buckley doesn't like. Here's another. And another. The effect is only slightly more appealing than a six-hour tape of Andy Rooney."
3,The line between witty and smart-ass is a thin one,"This is such a disappointment. I loved Thank You For Smoking and White House Mess, and this is what you feared when you first heard he was a writer; a snotty rich creep shows his snob wit. With many satire writers, more is less, but he works much better where he doesn't have to be in a hurry to strike his target."
3,"Humorous, Insightful, and a Little Snobby","Although I truly enjoyed this book, by the time I finished I really had a good sense of East Coast life, especially those who mix in circles where royalty is called by their first names while on a cruise down the Amazon! Some chapters in this collection of essays are laugh-out-loud funny, such as 'Hemlines of History'; others taught me a lot about aircraft and aircraft carriers; still others had me bored and wondering if the essay was supposed to be poking fun at the elite, or written in complete seriousness about a world I know nothing about, nor really care about. Maybe its because I live on the West Coast, and we are more informal, but some of Buckley's concerns and gripes don't seem all that important to me. However, I do recommend this book because it is well written and a wonderful example of the lost art of essay writing."
2,"All in all, fairly dull","The book's high points include a hilarious description of Tom Clancy and an enormously entertaining index. As for the rest, it is fairly lame."
1,very disappointed,"I too brought this cover to fit the simmons contour changing table pad 16"" by 32"". As a matter of fact, I brought two white covers and washed them according to the directions. However, both of them would not fit on the pad. The first cover I tried on was actally ripping as I was trying to put it on the pad. Nice work simmons!! Stick with the mattresses.Update: I was able to return both of the covers at Babies r us, which the cashier labeled as ""defective"", and bought two basic comfort ultra plush changing pad covers. I washed both of those according to the directions and they fit like a champ."
1,Shrinks!!!!,I bought this cover to go with the Simmons change pad and it shrink. I did not dry it and washed according to the instructions. Everytime I wased it it got smaller and smaller and now it doesn't fit. The Especially for baby cover is much softer and nicer and doesn't shrink....I even put it in the dryer.
2,Doesn't Wash Well At All,"I received two of these for a shower gift. We did a preliminary washing of all my sons clothes and linens in baby detergent. One of the covers got a hole in it the size of a nickel, just from the first washing. I had to patch it before we even used it. The subsequent washings over the past few weeks have made them to look like 10 year old towels with pulls and loose strands. We followed the washing instructions."
4,No holes for baby restraint straps,"I agree with the previous reviewers that these are great pads (and you should definitely buy two!), but ours don't have cutout holes for the baby restraint straps attached to the changing pad. I don't know how many folks actually use the straps-- I prefer to just keep a hand on my baby-- but if you plan to use them, you'll have to cut the holes yourself or something."
4,"Has what I wanted, a little hard to find stuff.","I bought this specifically because I wanted some of the writings in the book, so there's not much to say about it's contents. The book is laid out a bit weirdly and it makes it hard to find stuff, but other than that it has what I wanted."
4,Good information,"This book gave me information I have not found in other books of the Germans coming to Texas. The ship lists are not completely accurate, but then none of the others are either. Only a few of the ship lists are included, maybe this is a history of one family and most pertinent to them. The book included lots of good information however, and absent of minutia."
5,A primary source on German immigration to Texas,"This book is one of several primary sources that are a foundation to studies of German immigration to Texas in the 19th century. It focuses on what many consider to be the first wave of German immigration to the state, and is a key, welcome addition to anyone with an interst in that or related topics. Certainly, decisions about traveling across the ocean to a strange, undeveloped land were not easy for the immigrants who made the trip or for their friends and family members who were left behind in German lands. Additional insights into that seldom-explored issue -- the effect of 19th century German emigration on the folks who stayed behind -- is explored in the bookMan of Two Worlds."
4,Cuts through windshield grime,I got this glass cleaner just to fill up a last little bit of an order to get free shipping. I was surprised when it did as good as the Invisible glass product I have been using.
1,a waste of money,this bed air goes out to often and has big bubbles in it wish i never HAVE BOUGHT IT
3,"I like it, but...",After being washed and dried twice one of my two covers has already ripped down the elastic seam. What a bummer!
1,Shrinks!,"I love the feel of the terry cloth but the cover shrinked at the first washing!! Also, it is starting to unravel and strings are poking out everywhere! Color selection is great, but that's it!!"
1,Spend the extra $$$$!!,"I registered for the terry changing pad cover thinking it was a good price and should do the trick!! I was WRONG!!! It started to unravel after the first washing and the softness goes away immediately. Spend the extra money and purchase the Chamois Cover from Pottery Barn Kids. It is worth the extra $5. I have two of them and they wash EXTREMELY well (stays soft, stains come out, etc.) and it has slits for the safety belt. If your baby is anything like mine he is on his changing pad quite a bit and I think he really likes the softness of the Chamois material."
3,Not Pleased with this item.,"I bought this item going by the measurements thinking it would fit my changing pad, boy was I wrong. You have to struggle to get this cover over your changing pad and it is a snug fit on it. I don't recommend this brand."
5,"Fits snuggly, washes well, very happy!","I like that the pads fit closely. I was not terribly concerned about ""smushing"" the corners of my contoured changing pad. If it were any larger would bother me if it slid around. I think a tight fit is safer (a wiggly baby can't losen it at all.) I love mine and bought them as shower gifts for friends too!"
1,A Big Waste of Money!,"My husband and I bought two of these covers in preparation for the birth of our son. The first time I washed both covers (according to the instructions), neither survived. Both covers emerged from the wash frayed and with holes. Considering that these are items that will require plenty of washing in the future, we were very disappointed with the quality. Also, at $12.99 a pop, we expected better quality."
2,Wears Terribly!,"After a few washings, this cover looks horrible. The thread comes loose from the elastic, and there is fuzz imbedded in it. The Especially for Baby brand is a lot better & the cover also doubles as a co-sleeper mattress cover."
2,Not necessary,"I read the books that suggested getting a cover for the changing pad, and I put it on when I was putting our room together. It gives a finishing look to our Changing table -- however once we brought our son home, we ended up changing it everytime we changed him. Granted it's our first child, so maybe you will be much neater when changing your baby, but we are pretty good at it now, and I still wouldn't put it on. It's just another thing to wash -- and he loves lying on the Changing pad with no cover. It's nice to look at, but not necessary."
1,Forget it!,Washed it once according to directions & it shrunk beyond belief! Didn't even use it once! Don't bother!!! Just use a pillowcase & it works just as well...
3,Nice but they snag when washed,"These are great -- we have two so that when one is dirty, we can have a clean one. But they snag, very easily, in the washing machine. A lot of times, I find that it works just as well to use the changing table pad without a cover -- the plastic is much easier to clean up and you don't have to do laundry. A receiving blanket over the plastic cover works just as well, and washes up better ;)"
4,Good Covers,I haven't experienced any problems like the other customers. I've been using 2 light blue covers now for 21 months and they've haven't shrunk and still look the same. They're not as soft and fluffy as they were brand new but that's to be expected. I've never had a problem with the straps since they are underneath the pad and wrap up and around. I have the Simmons changing pad so maybe that's the difference? I like how they have a large color selection making it easier to cordinate with your nursery colors.
3,Good basic covers,"We have four of these covers- one blue, two green, and a yellow. They definitely make the changing pad a more comfortable surface for our baby- he loves just hanging out on them. We leave a lap pad on the cover which is the first line of defense against accidents during changes. This somewhat reduces the frequency of cover washings. Some people have noted that they find these covers unnecessary- I'm sure the changing pad would be adequate by itself, but I just feel like the whole area is cleaner when I can throw the cover and pad into the laundry.Be advised that all our covers did shrink slightly after washing. They do, however, continue to fit well on the pad. The colors also faded slightly with washings."
1,Shrunk in the wash,These covers shrink in the washing machine. The cover now bends the changing pad causing it to rip in places. I will now need to purchase a new changing pad. The cover now measures 27 or 28 inches long instead of the original 32 inches it started out as. This is after only 2 months of use.
2,SHRINKAGE!!!,"I really like the color selection and the softness of this product, but I am very disappointed by the shrinkage. The cover barely fits over the pad (weren't they made to go together?) and the pad itself it turning up at the corners. When I lay my baby down on the pad, he is comfortable, but he sinks into the pad because it doesn't fit properly. It does look nice, though in our nursery, but if I could do it over I would have selected a different pad and cover."
1,Way too small!!!,"I have a standard sized (16x32) changing pad and I bought this cover for it because I liked the color. I was extremely disappointed because it will not fit, no matter how hard I try to stretch it. I am returning this."
3,Old Timey,"My Husband bought me this set, it reminded me of the set my Grandmother once had. The colors are all really vibrant. The only thing is they are not shipped very securely, one of the cups was dented upon arrival. Also found out you CANNOT make Kool-Aid in them, it does something to the metal."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this pitcher as a gift for a good friend, but was very disappointed in the product when it arrived. I could not give it as a gift as it was very low quality and the finished was scratched inside. I purchased similar glasses set from another vendor and was much more satisfied. I am sending this product back for refund!"
3,Good for the Experienced Party Thrower,"I've been throwing big parties for my kids for many years, and this is my first year as room Mom for my daughter's class, and I was responsible this year's Holiday Party. I bought this book in hopes of getting some ideas on what to do to entertain 29 excited nine-year olds for two hours. I liked some of the game ideas in the book, however, I didn't find the book to have a decent party outline or schedule for these games and the like. Luckily I've thrown many kids' parties, so I had a reasonable idea on how to schedule the party, although, I believe a beginner would be lost in party planning if that person depended solely on this book."
3,plimouth,"First of 2 books that are first hand accounts written about Plymouth Colony that I have read.Language of 17th Century England, and I was thankful for the Introduction and the footnotes.Written, I beleive, to help sell the new colony especially after the failure of the Jamestown Colony.I enjoyed reading it because it gives us the real info about Plymouth Rock and the First Thanksgiving, rather than being filtered by later persons.histor"
4,"The ""American Dream"" and Puritan Propaganda","In the colonial stage of America's discovery, Europeans' conception of America appeared to be positive because at this stage the subject was the exploration and settlement of America and that was why Europeans received exaggerating accounts of the New World and its manifold opportunities. The colonizers' tracts and the travelers' accounts exaggerated the romantic attractions of the New World. The vast and abundant resources of the New World were admired, in a propagandistic and persuasive discourse. Both the Puritans and the colonizers (which were often one and the same) wrote exaggerating accounts of their adventures to lure Europeans over to the New World. Mourt's Relation (1622) was written to persuade Europeans that life in Massachusetts was a venture in a plentiful land. The book overlooks the calamities of the first winter and overstates the rich resources of Massachusetts. Yet, it is an excellent read."
1,"Yet Another Book Capitalizing On The Term: ""Sorcery""","Typical high brow thinking. No one but other high brows want to read this droll, boring crap thus the author and publisher resort to catchy buzz words that attract interest. I checked this out at the local university and narcolepsy hit me so fast I thought I was reading A. E. Waite's The Holy Kabballah again! How anyone finds this overly verbose, high brow subject interesting goes to show that one does not need creativity to thrive in a sterile environment.Has nothing to do with the Occult sciences whatsover so if you're interested in the Occult, skip this work."
4,Frisbee Golf,"I purchased this game for our Fun Fair. I was looking for a frisbee tossing game. This is similar to Frisbee Golf. The assembly was quite easy. The overall size is fairly small. To solve the size problem in our Fun Fair, I purchased an orange 5 gallon bucket from Home Depot and placed the game on it. Not only did this solve the height problem, but also gave us a storage device for this game. Other than the small size of the game, everything else worked out fine. This game will be a keeper for next year's Fun Fair."
3,"Cool, but very small, not for serious play.","My 10 year older son ordered this because he enjoys throwing a Frisbee (full size), and Frisbee golf was fun at summer camp. He was really surpised at how small it is. We know it said mini, but it's really mini, like micro-mini. Each disk is 3.75"" inches in diameter. They are very light and small so the do not float well when thrown. He still has fun with it, and it's so small he can play inside the house. But if you are looking for a frisbee that throws well, this isn't for you. It for goofing around in a small area."
3,Nothing special,"I got this product because I incorrectly assumed there would be six standard sized Frisbee. My dogs like to chew Frisbee and I thought this would be a cheap way to feed their appetite. When I received the package I was disappointed with myself that I did not read the reviews close enough to understand that these were mini, the size of a hamburg. My dogs enjoyed chewing them, but they were ready to be thrown out after the first session.Regardless... it is made with thin plastic, which will not last long, and do not through that well. The catching part seems like junk and I plan on placing it in the recycling bin if it is properly marked.This may be good for small children, inside a home playroom, and not outside. Otherwise, I would not recommend it."
4,Good Soap - Doesn't Last Very Long,I started using the natural salt deodorant to get away from the aluminum. I figured using a Tea Tree soap with it's antiseptic properties would help make the sale deodorant more effective. It does but this soap only lasts about 2 weeks per bar with two people using it in the shower. But it may be no different than other soaps. It's the best price I could find for Tea Tree Soap. I like that it has gentle abrasives in it. 4.5 oz bar is a medium size bar. Wish I could find it in a larger version.
1,I did not enjoy the movie,I did not enjoy the movie. It seemed very long. It went on and on forever. I would not recommend it for any age group.
4,Two superb performances!,"As you would expect, Rip Torn turns in a bigger than Life performance, but even Rip can't steal this movie from Tantoo Cardinal. Wow, what a performance! She apparently even plays without some teeth. I've seen her in ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Black Robe"", and I wish I could find more of her. She deserves an Oscar.The only weakness of the film is a miscast (and unimpressive) Michael J. Fox. Treat Williams has only three short scenes, and was okay, but I can't figure why he was cast at all."
5,Love this movie because its where I'm from. VT. N.E.K.,this is also a good flick not just because I am from Vt. Its a good story and well done. its works good to.
4,Pride And Progress,An old man's pride and stubborness does battle with progress in the woods of 1927 Vermont. Fine performances and music make for a film worth seeing.
2,not for me,I just finished watching Where The Rivers Flow for the first time. I got this dvd for Christmas from a co-worker. My work decided that everyone should wrap up a gift from home instead of buying a gift.Well this dvd was a gift I got.I would have never added this movie to my dvd collection. It's not my type of movie that I enjoy to watch. I did think it was interesting. The girl who keeps calling the guy Mr. is annoying. This is still not a movie I would normally buy/watch.
3,griffin itrip,I give it a three. It works pretty good most of the time. Occasionally it has trouble getting good reception.
4,Up to expectations,I purchased my iTrip nano from amazon just a few days ago and today it arrived.the overall look matches the 1st gen nano perfectly. Yet I can see that the sticky pad will only last for so long and without it the nano sicks out at the top by about 2 mm. The antenna is easily found at the base on the back around the griffin label. The usb connection from the iTrip to my computer is a usb mini type connector the same as the psp and a few other mp3 players I own but the connection is just as good as the apple usb cord. The sound quality in a house is as good as the radio stations that come in well even through a wall and 15 feet of air. I have not tried in a car but i can not imagine it being that bad. overall it was defiantly worth the price at less than 20 dollars with shipping.
3,"Works, but has some issues.","The nanotrip itself works great. I can use it in the car or with any radio. The issue with it is when you take the ipod out for charging and then replacing it in the itrip cradle. The connection isn't as good as the initial time and you kinda need to hold it in to make the quality better. So, overall the itrip somewhat becomes useless (since I cannot use it in the car without holding it) It does work somewhat, but the static caused by the poor connection makes it less desireable."
4,Exactly what I needed,"I read many reviews before I bought my iTrip and they made me very wary. I have to say I am more than pleased with the performance of my iTrip and I have not had many of the problems I read about, with one exception. The iTrip is a battery drainer. I too get around 3 hours of use before I have to plug it up. 99% of the time the sound is perfect and I hear no static at all. Occasionally when I'm in the car and I pass a certain spot in town I hear some static, but it's no big deal for me. I originally bought it b/c I had a 10 hr road trip ahead of me. I didn't want to carry a bunch of CDs but I wanted the variety I had on my Nano. It worked beautifully! Now I use it in the car, in the office or anywhere I can find a radio. It has definitely improved the functionality of my Nano."
4,Not a bad deal 4 wireless setup,"First of all I have used the itrip for the mini and it performed well for its purpose. I went to best buy and this product cost 50+ $$$. SO saving money right there. I like the practicality of the itrip, it may not work well with your stereo or car or even both. It depends on you location and the radio your using. For some reason its great in my car and horrible in my brothers. A little staticy on my stereo but minor, I'm not a cry baby about things nor do I expect premium quality sound everytime I use it. If your location is heavy populated and a crammed radio dial then get something else. I also got a car charger with a usb cable to connect to the port on the itrip, the battery can;t handle long hours, so its best to get a car charger for just that. Motorola razor or slider have usb chargers you can get anywere."
3,ipod trans,works well with home stereo but is sometimes fuzzy when used in the car. Must be very close to the radio to work. also the back part loses its stickiness and its hard to make the ipod stay after that
3,Definitely has its flaws,"This thing definitely isn't perfect, but it works. A couple of operational notes: you can't see the transmitter antenna, but if you have your hand over it when you hold it, the transmission goes really bad. The control is not entirely intuitive, mainly because it has only one button that does control. However, set up is as easy as hooking your iPod into; no additional software. A couple of complaints: the radio stops when you are go into the menu of this transmitter; the suction strip is useless (which means having the integrated unit stand upright is a definite challenge). The transmission stopped a couple of times with no reason, and the menu on the iPod was scrolling by itself. Very strange!One nice feature: you can save 3 station presets."
1,"Nice looking, but poor performing","If you are into just looks then get this transmitter. If you want something that works, look elsewhere. I purchased this based on a few reviews I read on an iPod website but when i received the iTrip I was greatly dissapointed. It sounded awful, even when there was not static. Once you start driving the sound is brutal, static, and you have to really crank your radio to hear the music. I like the fact that you can fine tune it, but even when i set it to mono and found a totally dead station the sound was not listenable to me. I then purchased the monster icarplay and it works 1000 times better. usually i am not a big fan of monster products but that product works perfect, on every channel i tried. Stay away from this."
4,Nice if you have no tape deck,"Use it in my car all the time, works well. You may have to deal with quite some static in certain spots though, but have no problem listening to podcasts 95% of the time. If you listen to music, it may not be the best solution. Would not buy it again if I had a tape deck in my car, or any other easy solution to plug my iPod"
2,Wait for it to go on sale.,"I bought this product 4 months ago and it is already giving me problems. It transmits to the radio about as well as most FM trasmitters, but the Nano tends to slide off of the dock area which causes the sound quality to fade. Cool design, bad function."
3,Not bad for the price,Pros:Low PriceFunctionalmini-usb chargerCons:Lots of hissingCan be difficult finding a clear station in your areaCan't really complain as it works as advertised with such a low price tag.
4,"Once I velcro'd it right next to my radio, it worked great!","I was at first quite disapointed with the static and sound quality of the iTrip Nano. Howevever, once I bought a velcro package and attached it right next to the radio it worked great!My advice if you are having the same issues that I had..do the same as I did and also experiment with the best digital station to use."
1,Bad quality control?,"Based on other reviews, it would seem that this product suffers from bad quality control. Form: 4+ stars, Function: 1 starForm: Great design. It integrates perfectly with the iPod Nano. The control button on the side works well but takes a little getting used to. The features it offers are nice on paper... if they actually worked, that would be nicer.Function: I purchased what I thought would be a nice replacement for an older FM transmitter that I use that required being powered by the cigarette lighter. My first attempt to use this product was inside the house with my home stereo... as other reviewers have commented, anything outside of 1 foot from the antenna (high powered, high gain antenna at that) developed static. At 5 feet away, no signal could be detected at all. This was repeated on numerous channels. In the car, the static was always there. I attempted to use clear channels throughout the range and always received the same annoying static."
1,Great concept ruined by implementation,"This little ditty is great in concept but Griffin ruined it by making it dependent on a headphone jack instead of the dock adapter as they have done in their other FM Modulators.The interface is really nice.As with most FM Modulators, either the FCC or the companies who make these things never make them capable of making enough signal strength to actually be useful. Consider the kensington pico adapter or Xtreme Mac's solution (which includes an antenna)."
2,iTrip,"I guess I got what I paid for, $0.01. It's a pretty shoddy transmitter that only works intermittently. I find that I pretty much have to hold it right next to the radio in order for it to work. If you get irritated by static, spend the money for a better iTrip."
1,Junk,DO NOT Buy this product. They must have purchased this from a garage sale. It came in a plastic bag with no manual and did not work.
3,Deception,The product was showed with a pink ipod nano and it does not fit my pink ipod nano. I was displeased with the fact that they said that it would work with my ipod and it did not.
2,not for second generation nano,This item does not work with second gen Nanos. I don't know why the product description fails to mention this. The one page manual that comes with it does not mention this either. You have to go to the mnfctr website to find this out.
3,"works well, could use more power","As with all FM modulators, you get interference. But the compact size is great. I noticed it works better in some cars than others, and depends greatly on the placement and proximity to the radio. Do not try to charge it through the USB port while its playing, you will get horrible sound."
4,Griffin iTrip Nano LCD/FM Transmitter for iPod Nano,I have had my transmitter for about a month.I really like it. It works well but if you are going to use it for extended periods you have to have the charger plugged in while you use it because the battery life was not that great. Other than that I love it.
3,Static?,"I do not have a iPod Nano therefore I do not have the iTrip Nano, but for those of you with static: Perhaps this was fixed in later modules and may render this post useless, but I have found with my 4th Gen iPod and iTrip that if the volume is less than 50% it will turn the transmision off over time. If the volume is too high (above 75%) it will also become static because it's broadcasting too loudly. Again, it may be different in iPod Nanos as Griffin may have disabled volume controls for its iTrip Nano, but that is my discovery. Also station selection is often a problem. I can select 87.9 which has done wonders for me, but from what I've understood some transmitters do not offer that station. Get one that does! In my area it is the best station available for transmission and no competition. Traveling long distances you will find station competition, however, so give it time and it will pass."
1,incredibly disappointed,"this product is terrible. all i heard was static, even if i placed it next to the car stereo. i ended up returning it and purchasing the road trip one. it costs more but i haven't had any problems with it."
1,Bad quality of sound,"Probably due to local circumstances (I used this product in Moscow, Russia) the quality of sound was so poor (as noisy as a far-away radio wave) that I stoped using this transmitter."
2,New Nanos Beware,"As someone else observed in October, the base connections don't fit the new Nano, but the unit seems pretty slick, so I'm passing it along to a friend."
1,Get a hard-wired connector,"I immediately returned my FM transmitter for the Nano. It's very frustrating when technology is released before it reaches an acceptable level of quality. This transmitter literally needs to be sitting directly on the radio or the sound is flooded with static. I'd even try turning it around, upside down, whatever...nothing worked. Even direct contact is no guarantee. Forget about manipulating the song lists. It's very disconcerting listening to music up loud, then getting hit with a burst of static. Maybe other transmitters are better, but I wouldn't bet on it. I bought something called a ""Nano Starter Kit"" for $40 at Circuit City. It had a wall charger, car charger, cassette adaptor for the car, stereo adaptor wires, a case, an extra set of headphones. Even if half the stuff fails, it's better than paying $20 or more for each of those items through Apple or the more popular companies."
1,INOPERABLE PRODUCT,"This product did not match the description - it was a faulty product that did not fit the iPod nano, had to be tossed."
2,Caution,I bought this and found out it does not fit all Nano iPods. At least Amazon is taking it back at no charge.
1,Broken after three uses,The headphone jack snapped in half after three uses. $38 seems like a lot of money for a flimsy disposable product.
3,Okay Product,This product works about ~70% of the time. I live in a fairly rural area so I get better reception than in a big city. The best advice I can give is buy two large rubber bands to snug the nano onto the base. This little trick improved the sound by 60%.Good luck
2,Great While It Lasted,"I loved this product for the first 30 days I had it. It worked well and was nice and compact - no wires dangling all over my car. Then all of the sudden, it has lost its broadcasting strength. I have to hold it right next to the radio (on any frequencey I try) and even then, can barely hear it through all the static."
1,Never again,Did not work. I will never purchase this again. Do not choose this product. Does not work as you would think. Worse few bucks I have ever spent for and iPod. Especially an old model too. Do not waste your time and just upgrade to an iPod with this feature.
1,ITrip for Opod Nano,"In spite of the fact that I gave the seller the type of Ipod I had, the ITrip connection did not fit my Ipod Nano."
2,"If you want it for a Christmas gift, better order in August!","My husband loves Mallomars but the delivery cost was very steep, especially considering they were delivered 2 1/2 months after I ordered them. I won't purchase from this company again."
5,Yum!,"Very fast shipping and we now have 6 yummy boxes of Mallomars to pig out on--I mean savor. It's nearly impossible to find these in any stores, so it's nice to have a source!"
3,Product Description Lies!,"While the name of this product says 1 box (18 cookies), the product description says 3 boxes.DON'T BE FOOLED, THIS ONLY ONE BOX, NOT THREE!(but the cookies are good, so that's why 3 stars)."
3,Mallomars are not worth $10 per pound!!!,"Nabisco makes a much better product than the highly over rated Mallomar, an 8 oz box is $5, that works out to $10 per pound..You want a really excellent cookie then get Nabisco Pinwheel cookies, made on the west coast for $3.67 per box at WINCO, that's for 12 oz of marshmallow/ chocolate cookie that will surely delight you.I've been eating these for over forty years and it's still the best cookie that Nabisco produces!!Safeway,Freddies and Albies also carry them, for about $1 more, GO WINCO!!!"
3,Not Rare After All,This product was represented to me as something only available on-line and for a short window of time yet I later saw them in my local grocery store.
2,Billy Crystal Let me Down,"I ordered this product because ""When Harry Met Sally"" is and has been my favorite movie for as long as I can remember. Billy Crystal's character comments in a later scene in the movie that it's New Years Eve; he has Dick Clark, and Mallomars the greatest cookie of all time. I figured I should at least know what my favorite movie deemed the greatest cookie actually tasted like. Not only was it extremely hard to order (apparently they are only made in certain areas during certain seasons) but as several of my friends and I tried tem we agreed not the best of all time, but not really even that good. (Not fatties, but definitely cookie lovers) We ended up giving the rest of the boxes away. Very disappointed in Billy who I assumed was a pretty stand up honest guy!"
5,Batman Action Figure is Cool!!!,This product is exactly what we expected and we are happy with it. The order came very quickly. That was nice because this purchase was a Christmas gift.
1,Disappointed toy,"My son was so excited to get this toy, but when he took it out of the box he could not get the glove to stay on his hand, and all the other parts would not stay on, they were popping off all the time. He was very disappointed, and so was I."
4,cute crabby!,"we actually purchased this twice, since the first one was lost. My now 7 month old son has really liked this toy since he was 4-5 months old. it's easy for him to hold and seems to captivate him."
2,Not your best choice,"Written at the height of the Cold War, and it shows. There is an abundance of memoirs by individuals who observed or participated in the events of 1917-1924 which make for much better, and easier, reading. Lunacharsky's ""Revolutionary Silhouettes"" is delightful. ""Lenin"" by Landau-Aldanov is opinionated and entertaining. Others include ""Days with Lenin"" by Maxim Gorky; ""Russia in the Shadows"" by HG Wells; ""Encounters with Lenin"" by Valentinov; and many more. If one is looking for a serious analysis of Lenin's political thought, modern writers such as Neil Harding and Lars Lih are more useful."
4,I actually enjoyed it... on the most part,"Well, after The Lion King, Disney has sort of gone... down hill. But, I was not disappointed by Tarzan. It was cute (little girls will love Jane), but had a quality to make it enjoyable to little boys as well. If anyone protests to seeing a cartoon man in loin cloth, see the original Tarzan movies. Hah."
3,Bre's,"Well, for starters, this movie has great animation and an even greater soundtrack. Minnie Driver's english accent is aunthentic. The characters are good, typical Disney characters. However, while I loved the first half of the movie, I found that after half-way the plot quickly disintegrated. A good movie should not only start strong but finish strong. Still, quite enjoyable."
4,"Great, but you'll have to wait to see it!","Loved Tarzan. but the DVD *forces* you to sit through several trailers before allowing you to actually see the movie. This is no fun when your 2-year old is screaming for Tarzan! Disney programmers have single-handedly negated the instant access features of the delivery system. Now we insert the DVD and watch something else until we're sure the movie is ready to play. Disney, get a clue!"
4,*****Wow!******,"This is a great movie but its the kind that you can get a little tired of after a while. I didn't really care for Minnie Driver's voice for Jane Porter; it didn't fit somehow. And while the music in Trashin' the camp was differant from the rest of the soundtrack,it was refreshing and I thought it fit perfectly with the destruction of the camp.Phil Collins did a superb job with the music. I got goosebumps on several parts,he's that good. His singing voice just seems to fit with the wild jungle setting. All in all,a good movie."
1,I returned it.,I could almost put up with the poor audio... but the trailers were too much so I returned the video.I won't put up with this practice and neither should you. Send Disney a message and return your DVD.
1,AVOID THIS!,"This is the most disgusting use of forced advertisement I have ever seen in my life! Disney forces you to sit through **4** minutes.. *_4_* minutes of babble about thier website and other movies. I am returning this and getting the VHS version. My children want to be subjected to Tarzan, not the Disney marketing machine."
1,PROTEST MANDATORY COMMERCIALS,"I inserted my DVD with anticipation, since I heard many good things about Tarzan. However, Disney previews were the first thing to show up on the screen. I was thankful that I was watching a DVD, rather than a videotape, since I could immediately skip to the movie, rather than having to fast forward through the TEN MINUTES of commercials, as I do on my VCR. Imagine my unbelievable disgust when I realized that Disney had ""locked"" their TEN MINUTES of commercials such that I was unable to skip the commercials (similar to the ""lockout"" typically used to display the copyright notice). Since my kids like to watch movies over and over, that means that I will have to suffer through these TEN MINUTES of commercials EVERY SINGLE TIME! If you share my disgust for such ""shove it down their throat"" tactics, please let Disney know. How dare they mandate that we watch their commercials EVERY SINGLE TIME."
2,"Forced Commercials! -- This is DVD, not VHS Disney!","The movie was great, ... the visuals were astounding, the acting and singing were very good, the story was solid (albeit along the typical Disney ""formula""), and the soundtrack was up there with other Disney animated classics.I gave it a 2 out of 5 stars because of the FORCED COMMERCIALS. Someone forgot to tell Disney that this was DVD, not VHS. It's not a tape -- it's a digital format. Disney seems to be attempting to cram all of the rotten things about VHS into their DVDs.All trailers or commercial material of any kind should be accessible from the DVD menu -- NOT PLAYED AUTOMATICALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE! Why on Earth do my children need to sit through non-Tarzan material every time they watch Tarzan. This is so INCREDIBLY ANNOYING -- until Disney changes this practice, I will not buy another Disney DVD."
2,Rosie Ruined it!,"Imagine, some of the greatest animation ever filmed, including breakthroughs in new techniques, and a smooth soundtrack by Phil Collins, yet the film is actually ruined by sound. The sound I'm talking about is Rosie O'Donell's obnoxiously grating voice. It amazes me that the people producing such excellent visuals didn't think this was a problem. She's completely out of place, first of all. She sounds like a heavy metal guitarist in the middle of an orchestra. And what the heck accent is that, anyway? New York? Wisconsin? Chicago? It certainly doesn't belong in the jungle. I like Disney films, but unlike the rest of them, I can never sit through this movie ever again, unless it's on mute. The two stars are for the animation, which alone deserves five, but the three missing stars are for the horrible mistake in casting."
5,My kind of movie,I bought this movie for my great grand daughter and we are having the time of our life watching it!!!
2,This movie is NOT for 3 and 4 year olds,"The listing this movie for the 3-6 year old set is grossly misleading! My daughter saw this movie when she was 4 and was traumatized by the first 5 minutes of the movie. For weeks after she was petrified that her Dad and I would be killed. And ever since that movie she has adamantly refused to go to see any movie in a movie theater. I have tried to convince her that not all movies are as scary and reminded her that the Rugrats movie she had seen before, she liked very much, but she has been digging her heels in for over a year.The death of Tarzan's parents is NOT something a young child can handle. There has got to be a better way of categorizing movies than just a 'G' rating.The animation was pretty good but the story line was ""Disney silly""."
5,Absolutely wonderful,"I didn't think Tarzan was going to be be good just from watching the commercials. After a friend talked me into going to see it this past summer, I am quick to admit that I was wrong. I thought this was one of the best Disney cartoons in years. the villians were actually realistic and Tarzan even tried to save the villian from himself. A little bit too scary and too viloent at times, but overall the second best Disney cartoon ever (I still haven't seen one that will top Sleeping Beauty)."
5,Great Fun - Kids and Adults Will Both Enjoy This,"We own a lot (a LOT) of Disney animated DVDs, and our kids watch them often. Some (like Pocahontas and Hunchback of Notre Dame) get viewed once and then shelved because the music's crummy, the story's slow or dumb, and the kids just don't want to see them again. Tarzan, though, gets viewed again and again. Thank goodness it's a great, watchable story. Lots of action, wonderful job by Minnie Driver voicing Jane, pretty good Phil Collins music, all combine to make this an enjoyable watch. I'd recommend it to anybody looking for a good gift for young kids."
2,Audios/Ad's ruin this! [Buy] the collect. edit.,I was very disappointed with this DVD. With so much hype I was excited to finally be able to watch this movie. I had not previously viewed it at a theater. The DVD opens with 3 or 4 advertisements which can be skipped by jumping forward 4 chapters but that is uncalled for. The DVD DOES NOT have 5.1 audio on 5.0 and apparently the audio was [not proper] because its doesn't take an audio expert to hear that the audio and picture is not matched. At some points in the film what should be matched to a front speaker is actually coming from the opposite rear speaker. Big [mistake] if you ask me. With the 5.0 audio you have NO SPECIAL effects thru the subwoofer. Not to say the sub can't used but nothing specifically sent to it alone.I would recommend [buying] the collectors edition and hope that the 5.1 audio it advertises is true and correlated correctly. Maybe ...the marketing people can move the ads to extra features section or end of DVD.
2,Disappointing,"Tarzan didn't at all reflect how Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote him.He wasn't a knuckle walker, tree surfer. I found it childish thata character who has been around since l9l2 had touches of a musical. I love the fact that Tarzan resembled in the face and hair my favorite actor who played the character himself. I'm a sucker for a handsome ape man."
5,I cannot wait for this!!!,"With the release of 'Tarzan II' recently, which by the way I have NOT seen, it reminded me of how much I really liked the first one. Sadly though, it was no longer available on DVD. Then two weeks later, I hear they are going to re-release it! This is Disney's year, releasing Bambi, Cinderella, Tarzan, Emperor's New Groove, and Toy Story? I am beyond estatic!!!EDIT:I AM very diappointed with the fact that Disney marketed this as a 2 Disc Collector's Edition and they changed their minds at the last minute. Must be some marketing scheme or something, but I am truly not happy with them doing this. If you just want the movie, get this. If you're looking for more, wait a while."
5,A Must Have.....Great Movie. Buy it on DVD!,"I am a collector of Disney movies and Tarzan is an instant classic. It instantly beat out many other disney titles to sit as my 4th all time favorite Disney Movie; rght below 1-Little Mermaid, 2-Aladin, 3-Toy Story. The animation, and story line were great....but, the music & soundtrack is outstanding. This factor alone warrents buying this movie on DVD. My kids and I watched it 6 times back to back on the first day we got it and it has been watched many times since then. We probably would have already worn out a regular video tape. Only 2 little pieces of advice. 1-Buy This Movie! You will love it. 2-Buy It On DVD! You will be thankful that you did."
5,The original king of swing!,"I thought Tarzan was the best movie Disney had done in years, with it's last big success, to me anyway, being The Lion KIng. The animation in Tarzan was truly amazing and Phil Collins was the perfect choice to do the soundtrack. The plot was great and the characters were great. I really enjoyed this movie and I totally recommend it!"
3,This movie need's some skills !,"I admit the begining was ok , but in the middle ok let's just see dull diagouluge I mean you would fall asleep in the middle ! I like this movie belive me I do but lacking others Peeyou ! Bye"
5,Wonderful Change for Disney!,"I bought this movie for my daughter without ever having seen it. What I found when I watched was THE BEST movie that Disney has ever made. My daughter just can get enough of the monkeys, and I can't get enough of the songs! One of the things that makes this Disney movie stand out is it's break from the ""normal"" way Disney does their musicals. You know, where say, Belle is walking down the street and all of a sudden everyone starts singing? In Tarzan, the music is not sung by the characters, it's all in the background. If you only ever buy one Disney movie, buy this one. :-)"
4,Tarzan,"This is a good animated feature from Disney. The animation is quite good especially the scenes of Tarzan swining through the trees. Like many of Disney's recent animation it combines some element of drama. The score features great music from Phil Collins especially the Oscar wining ""You'll be in my heart"". The opening sequence may be disturbing for small children especially the scene were a jaguar kills a baby gorilla. In general it it a good family film."
3,a great disney flim,this was a pretty good one for disney. it had heart and good entertainment. however i felt the for young kids this would not be the best because the movie stars with so much vilonece with taraza parents and the baby goriila getting kiiled.
3,Buena Vista to offer corrected pressing?,"As of this morning Buena Vista Home Entertainment customer service (1-800-723-4763) was collecting names, addresses and phone numbers. They admitted to the audio defect but were waiting for clear instructions from above on how to proceed. Later callers report that they were told that a corrected pressing would be offered in exchange and that owners could either send in their current copy now or leave their information and be contacted later when exact information was available on the release of the corrected pressing."
2,Cute but hollow...,"I'm sorry...lot's of people completely LOVE this movie (including several people in my family)...but I don't. It is cute, it does have some humor, it does have some tense scenes, it is DISNEY, but that wasn't enough to carry my expectations for what Disney could have done with this material.I have read virtually all of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan books, and I can't believe that no one has yet gotten it really right. Disney's offering presents Tarzan as a pseudo-skateboarder sliding and swinging through the trees. What are his feet made of anyway? Again, I'm sorry, but I just can't buy into this version. So much potential, so much disappointment.2 stars."
3,What's all the hype about?,"I recently viewed Tarzan with my children, and truthfully was a little disappointed. Does anyone else feel that Disney's formula is wearing a little thin? OK, so we've got the middle-aged rock star scoring the music. And we've got some famous movie stars playing the characters. Disney obviously has the corner on the family market, but won't somebody in the entertainment field come up with something new and unique? What's the choice for us parents of small children? R-rated flicks or Disney? P-l-e-a-s-e! I am a subscriber to the Disney channel, but it all seems like a setup to me. Watch the Disney channel, see the movie, buy the video. Where are all the Frank Capras of this world? I'm tired of fantasy, I want some really inspirational stories from real life everyday people. HELP!"
2,Tarzan: WHAT'S UP WITH THIS!,"I think Tarzan was pretty good, except for all the violence! I mean, about 6 people died, and that Clayton guy was shooting everyone,Kerjack was not a very nice husband or father, and even Tarzan the ""hero"" of the whole movie was kind of rough. I really Disney could have done a better job."
4,The radical forest,"This film is great! Lots of fun and thrilling action. Edgar Rice Burroughs must be tumbling on his grave, but in satisfaction. Some things as been added and taken from the original story like Terk, Tarzan surfing in the trees and that he don't see where did he came from (London, that is). There is some sexuality, but in a very secretly way because this is a family movie. I recomend it very much."
5,My kids love this movie,My kids love this movie. They are 5 and they ask to watch it all the time. I am glad I got it.
5,Another great movie by Disney,"I don't know why I waited so long to see this movie. From the moment I put the DVD in and heard the beautiful music and saw the magnificent animation I knew I'd be hooked. I was never interested in seeing an animated flic when there had already been many hollywood versions of the story. But, this was truly a wonderful movie.If you have little children, you might want to talk to them before seeing it. In the beginning there are 3 deaths; Tarzan's parents are killed and the gorilla parents lose their young gorilla. I would definately still highly recommend this movie.The animation is colorful and really brings the story to life, while the soundtrack is superb. When I heard ""You'll be in my Heart"" by Phil Collins played in this movie, it really got me choked up.All of the characters, including Jane and Tarzan, are wonderully portrayed and both the animation and voices are great. I would definately recommend this movie to any Disney lover, children and adults alike."
5,They just keep getting better!,"this film is by far, the best Disney film, or any animated film, I have ever seen. Having always been a huge Disney fan I was losing interest when it released box office flops like Hercules and Mulan. However, Disney have more than made up for it with the newest edition to the animated classics. The mix of computer animation and original animation is breathtaking in parts, when Tarzan is swinging from vine to vine! We also immediately fall in love with all of the characters and their personalities. As if that wasn't enough,I was also impressed with the soundtrack too. Rather than having the characters randomly break into chorus like they did in their old films, Disney have opted for a more mature approach and hired Phil Collins to do the majority of the music. Impressive all round and this one (for once it's safe to say it!) is one for all the family that you can watch time and time again! You should definately be taking the magic home!"
2,"Ripping off ""Lion King"" & ""Little Mermaid""","I collect Disney DVDs, so getting this was a given. However, when I watched it for the first time, I was so sad about how much of the content had been directly copied from the two classics, ""Litlle Mermaid"" and ""Lion King"", I lost interest. The story is predictable, as are most Disney tales; however, the presentation was a repeat of other movies with very little of the classic imagination tied so closely to Disney films."
4,Stunning!,"Disney has done an incredible job in delivering a breath-taking visual experience, once again pushing the envelope in animation.As for the story, teens and older should read the book (a classic)."
3,I Like The Movie But..,"The actual DVD sucks. The menu is unimpressive and for some reason, there is like 10 minutes of advertising from Disney. The extras are boring too. I don't want to see a Phil Collins music video! I like the movie. It is funny and visually beautiful. The start is sad, but not as sad as Finding Nemo (a movie that I adore to no end!) As a Disney movie, it is a bit grown up for kids as there are guns and deaths. But hey, I know people who let children watch worse stuff than that, so I'm not complaining. In the end, the movie is watchable, but the DVD blows and isn't wirth the money. By the way, I'm not saying that Tarzan isn't good. Amazon tells us to review the PRODUCT as well as the movie. The movie gets a four from me and the DVD gets a minus ten."
2,Way to Violent for Younger Kids,"I don't let my four-year old watch this movie because of the violence at the beginning and end of the movie. It opens with Tarzan's parents being killed, and closes with a shooting and the (off camera) death of Clayton. When he tried to watch it, he was so scared by the opening few minutes that he left the room."
4,Great fun...but be careful showing it to young kids,"""Tarzan"" is, above all else, a triumph of artistry. The backgrounds and animations all have tremendous depth and beauty. The story TRIES for similar depth, but this is a Disney flick, so you never really get deeper than pat motivations for any of them.But the animation is spectacular, the action is terrific and quite thrilling, and the songs (by Phil Collins) are all very entertaining.If ""Tarzan"" has a major flaw, it's that it, like many other Disney movies, is a touch too violent for young kids. My four-year-old had nightmares about the leopard at the beginning of the movie for weeks afterwards.Of course, none of the violence gets past the ""implied"" level (this isn't ""The Matrix"", after all), but for many young kids, implication is scary enough.So enjoy ""Tarzan"", but be careful about letting young kids watch it, or watch it first to find out where the scary stuff is and cover their eyes when it happens."
5,Classic!,Great movie.. With an awesome soundtrack by Phil Collins. If u have small children some scenes may be too intense .
1,Not a 2-disc edition!,"The movie? Awesome. The DVD? Another Disney rip-off.Touted as a two-disc special edition all the way through the packaging of the Cinderella two-disc special edition, Disney silently changed its mind and charged an outrageous price for a single disc. Even the coupon inside the Cinderella DVD said that this would be a two-disc. Why did Disney change its mind last minute? No official word (and no apology when I complained), but you can bet the answer starts with a dollar sign."
4,Funny and clever,This movie is beautifully animated and has a clever plot. There are some scary parts with the mean cat at the beginning that might be a bit too much for very young children. It certainly was for mine. Probably wouldn't be a problem for children 4-5 and above.It has many comical parts and Rosie O'Donnell's little monkey character was very delightful. Really worth watching.
4,"Great Film, Can Bypass the Previews on DVD","This a must for all families! It does however have a few flaws in sound and the previews. They put the previews at the beginning of the DVD so you have to sit through them, once these previews start, you can not go straight to the menu. You instead have to forward through them. I have found a way to bypass the previews and go straight to the menu. If you turn on the DVD and before the licensing information starts, hit dvd menu and it will take you straight to the menu. (At least my Sony DVD player will) If you hit that menu button to late, though you're stuck or will have to turn the power off and try again. Otherwise, a great story that all ages will love. My 8 and 9 year olds have watched it 12 times already. Phil Collins does an excellent job on the music."
1,Disney's ham-fisted marketing RUINS this DVD,"If you don't like being maniuplated by Disney, which forces you to sit through an endless stream of promotional garbage, then AVOID this DVD. Paying for this will only encourage other studios to start treating their customers like sheep who can be forced to watch anything in the name of ""marketing."""
5,Tarzan Is A Swinging Good Time! My five year old loves it!,"This movie MOVES! It's very fast-paced, fun-filled, action-picked film, that will hold everyone's attention - from 3 year olds, to 103 year olds! There is a lot of humour in this movie, along with some cute sassy-mouthed characters, (typical of Disney!),suspenseful moments with a ferocious leopard, and a sensation of real love and closeness between Tarzan and his adopted ape mom; all of which add to the enjoyability of this movie. The style of animation in Tarzan is truly superb; the jungle really appears to ""come to life"" right before our eyes! In my family's opinion, Tarzan is one of Disney's best efforts to date! Definitely one that's worth owning!"
1,Blech,This movie is just wierd. A guy surfing on trees? Talk about splinters! Sick humor and Rosie O'Donell is annoying. I do not reccomend this video.
5,Is the Greatest Collector's Edition DVD ever!,"Hello, Everyone, I am a fan of this movie, i want invite to you, to know this 2 DVD-set, This Collector's Edition is great, fantastic and cool, because contains, all that someone could know about this movie, for that reason, I haven't seen this DVD yet, but i think, for the information that i know, This DVD will be the best Collector's Edition ever, you can watch all the stuff of Tarzan, you can heard in in spanish or french. Well that is all for now, I am from Mexico. AHHHHHHHHHHHH"
2,shame on Disney,"yes, this is a great film, good video and audio. BUT shame on Disney for abusing the DVD technology. They added 4 trailers and 1 Disney commercial before the movie, right after the copyright info. Just as the copyrights, you can not break out of these commercials or fast forward. Great for Disney, a captive audience every time you load the DVD.Shame on them, since they seriously turned off buyers like myself. If I could return this, I would!"
4,You'll be in my heart,"I must say it is a very good movie. Like I said, it will always be in my heart, but Im sure Disney can do a little better than that. But the movie is fun waching, funny, and recommended."
5,Tarzan,"This is definitely the complete package of what one excellent DVD , love this movie by Disney, perfect for all ages."
3,FORCED COMMERCIALS!,DON'T BUY THIS DVD You and your child will loose time every time you see this movie because the disc has control of your DVD and you have to see the same commercials every time that you see the movie. It's a good movie not disney's best but very watchable but the commerials ruin the entire experience don't buy it on DVD you'll have to buy the VHS version and fast foward the movie after you are tired of seeing the same preview view after view I hope they delete those commercials in a near future so that I can buy this good movie for my little sister.
4,"Forced commercials, think twice about Disney DVD's","My 4 yr old really enjoys this movie, but the forced commercials are very annoying. This hits my biggest dislike of the DVD format, that the player is under control of the disk programming. Disney shows a lack of respect for their customers. This was my first Disney DVD, and I will be very selective in the future."
4,Loved the Movie - Hated the Ads,I would have given this movie 5 stars were it not for the barrage of ads at the beginning of the DVD. Shame on Disney.
1,FORCED TO WATCH PREVIEWS!,"If you like to watch previews before you view the main feature, then by all means get this dvd. The lame execs at Disney have made a decision on your behalf that you are better off watching these previews. There is no way to skip, fast forward, jump to the menu to avoid the ads. They have even exploited the dvd technology to prevent you from stopping the movie, how lame is that! Imagine if every dvd you buy contains at least 4 or more minutes of previews that you are forced to view, imagine real hard because if Disney is allowed to get away with ti, other movie distribution houses are sure to follow."
5,Loin cloth?,"Disney has made the story of Tarzan a classic cartoon. I LOVE this movie.The previews at the beginning of the DVD ""CAN"" be fast forwarded,(Dont know what type of DVD player other reviewers have)I am able to skip over them and get to the movie-but all in all that is what is called ADVERTISING people!!! Movie previews are also on any VCR tapes you buy/have bought-why give a GREAT movie a bad review just because you have a cheezy dvd player and you can't get the dvd to fast forward???? GIMMIE A BREAK PEOPLE!!!!This movie was packed full of action, tenderness, compassion and fun. The music is OUTRAGEOUS and makes you want to get up and dance along. I recommend it highly!!!!"
1,"Guns, deaths, hangings-not a hot one for sensitive children","Guns, death, hangings...alright for Disney and America! OK, OK, I admit it was good for me, but my almost 3 year old cried about the momma, daddy, and gorilla's untimely (read: not suppose to happen this violently) death. I've always had a sensitive guy on my hands so if you do too then stay away! We are sticking to blue's clue's and sesame street! P.S. BOO FOR DISNEY FOR SHOWING A HANGING! YES, IT IS TRUE... WHEN CLAYTON DIES THERE IS A SHADOW OF HIS BODY HANGING FROM THE VINES ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF YOUR TV. CHECK IT OUT! NICE ENTERTAINMENT FOR OUR CHILDREN?"
5,Excellent!,This is one of the best Disney animated films---absolutely fabulous opening sequence! The music is wonderful and fun.
5,-+ The +- Best dvd I have so far.,"Where to begin? how about here...Simply placing the dvd inside of my player (pc) and turning on powerdvd And hitting play I was absolutly stunned.. There where little/hardly any visible artifacts on this disc (where as say ""deep blue see"") has lots and the bars (wide screen blink) The dual layer media on this disc is absolutly masterful, it has dolby 5 (not 5.1 unfortunatly) but the disc contains LOADs of extras.. like a full blown music video's, behind the scenes.. I can't wait for the collectors edition because I will buy that one too."
1,Disneys only mistake!,"I am a 17yr female who grew up on Disney's movies, the Disney channel, and my fav vacations are to Disney world, but I belive that Disney made a huge mistake w/ Tarzan. The opening scene was almost to hard to bear. I have been raised very openly and have never been offened by a movie intill Tarzan. Before I watched the movie I knew that Tarzan would be orphaned, but I had no idea that they would show the blood of his parents and their bodies. I think Disney could have used a less disgusting way of showing that Tarzan's parents had died. I recomed you preview the video before you let your child view it."
3,Disappointing outing from Disney,"It's difficult to put a finger on it, but I was a little disappointed with this Disney offering. The sidekicks just aren't as entertaining as those in Hercules, the villain isn't as evil as in Pocahontas, the ambiance isn't as absorbing as in the Lion King, the songs aren't as catchy as the Little Mermaid .... the list goes on. It's just that this movie doesn't do anything really well, just a bunch of things okay, and so it adds up to only an okay movie. I would have to place it at the bottom of my list of Disney's offerings in the last few years.As for the DVD features, I can't complain about those! The howling during the interactive trivia game (to signify the right answer) got to be grating in a very short time (and yes, I played the entire game - most of it on mute), but still fun. And it's always nice to see videos and things like that. So for the extras, I'll give this a 4."
5,I was saved by a man in a loin cloth.,"It's amazing how fluid Disney animation is. There are so many thing in motion that it is really unbelieveable.I'm somewhat suprised that this film recieved a G rating, but that can be a good thing considering that theres enough subject matter to keep even adults entertained. DVD is definitly how animation should be seen. My only complaint is that Disney could have placed the previews as an option on the DVD menue instead of at the start of the disk. After watching the film several times the previews become a bit much to endure when all you want to do is get directly to the movie."
5,tarzan,"Excellent family entertainment. If you plan to purchase a family movie sometime soon, make it this one. It will be one your children(and you) will enjoy over and over!"
2,"Dull and Stereotypically ""manly""","This is probably one of my least favorite Disney movies. The atmosphere is too heavy, kind of along the same problems of ""The Fox and the Hound."" Tarzan has too many muscles on his body, it's more about the action, the music is lousy, and I don't like the story. They should have stuck with Tarzan trying to earn his family's respect instead of the torn between two love stories. I also pass on those bland uninteresting Phil Collin songs. My biggest problem with the movie is Tarzan's so-called gorilla father, Kerchak. I know he's the protector of the family, but I just don't like that guy. Terk and Tantor are okay for comic relief, but they're no Timon and Pumbaa. All in all, even though this is a jungle themed movie, I don't think it has the same charm as ""The Jungle Book"" or ""The Lion King."" It's just too socially awkward a film for me."
3,Mislead advertising..,"This dvd was in good shape. I'm particular with my purchases because I'm a collector of disney dvds. I purchased this product(Tarzan dvd) because in the picture it stated that the dvd came with a dvd slip case. When I recieved my purchase it didn't have it. I was disappointed because I thought the dvd came in the slip case. If I was aware they didn't include the slip case, I would have bought it in stores. Just like all the others.."
5,Tarzan,Great movie! Movie was shipped on time and came in great condition. This one is a classic favorite!
3,Not Disney's best...,"As a collector of Disney movies, I happily added this movie to my collection. My children and watched it once, then put it back on the shelf and went back to watching our old favorites. As much as the animation of this movie was hyped up before its release, I expected more. The best part of the movie was the character of Jane."
3,Somewhat lacking,I was less than impressed with the movie I was expecting a little more humor and lightheartedness in the movie and I thought it lacked in this area. It does have an appealing sound track and a somewhat different slant on the Tarzan saga but I was left expecting more
4,Breathtaking,Excellent effort from Disney. The animation is absoluteperfection. It almost seems three-dimensional sometimes. All thevoice talents did great jobs and the music was (surprisingly) outstanding. My only regret is that I didn't catch this in the theater. I'll definitely be getting the special edition DVD in April. END
5,ENOUGH WITH THE FEATURES ALREADY!,"I never thought I would ever utter such a profanity! This DVD is packed to overflowing with behind the scenes info. Detailed character development, Phil Collin's demo tape, the treatment, film-to-storyboard. After an hour I gave up! I realized that I didn't like this movie enough to know so much about it. This is excellent news for devout Tarzan fans though, and it's only $29.99! A Bug's Life is still $39.99, so it looks like Disney is coming down a little on the price. Still, this should have been available with the original release so people wouldn't have to buy it twice. Now the big question, how about Tron, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Beauty & the Beast, The Black Hole, The Lion King, Toy Story 1&2 Collector's Editions?"
4,"For once, Disney did it!","I am a 12 year old girl who saw this movie in the theater last summer. I would probably recommend it. Even some of my friends who are up to age 17 loved it even more than me. It includes an awesome soundtrack. I would not recommend it, however, for a parent who's child did not like ""Bambi"". There are two sads parts in the movie, one almost exactly like ""Bambi"". I typically hate Disney movies such as ""Snow White"" or ""Cinderella"", but this movie was pretty good. The part when Tarzan is sliding down the trees is VERY stupid and unrealistic, and I did not see the first part of the movie, so I cannot tell you about that."
4,"One of the few good, modern Disney movies","This movie is one of the few modern Disney movies that is any good. It looks fantastic on DVD and doesn't push any of Disney's usual agenda.There are three problems with it, however.<1> The voice acting by Rosie O'Donnel is horrible. Whatever happened to using voice actors with good voices? Get a clue Hollywood! Just because an actor is good doesn't mean he or she is a good voice actor.<2> The hunter in movie was poorly represented. Any hunter worth his salt will not go around blasting his rifle at anything that moves. Once again Disney shows it's ignorance of hunters and is bias against gun owners.<3> This DVD forces you to either view or skip over about 7 previews before letting you view the movie. Come on people! If you want to put the previews on a menu option, that would make sense, but forcing us to skip past your stupid previews is rude. This alone will make me avoid ever buying another Disney movie."
1,Too sad!,This movie not for small children! I have a 4 year old and I regret letting her watch it. It is so incredibly sad and terribly violent for a children's film. I was shocked! If you or your child have any empathy at all - don't watch it! I would give it zero stars if I could.
3,"Great Animation, Formulaic Story","TARZAN (1999) * * * What's good about it: incredible animation, great voice characterization by Minnie Driver. What's bad about it: generic music by Phil Collins, very distracting voice work by a tiresomely obnoxious Rosie O'Donnell. What's so-so about it: standard, formulaic Disney story which pretty much writes itself by now. The picture and sound on the dvd are tremendous!"
4,Treo case,"Nice case, works well and looks good. Arrived a few days later than anticipated. Good price. Not using belt clip, because it sticks out too much. But intended to use without clip when purcased."
2,ok,"Did not live up to the hype. I know this guy is very popular right now, and perhaps his LIVE courses are great. On video it was just OK. I will state that the stretches outlined are good and the instrustion is detailed however it is all too fast..not relaxing..and don't allow the length of the video to fool you. It boils down to 2 7min segments..that is it. I usually end up pausing it, so I can hold the a stretch position for a decent lenght of time, he tends to just hold a position for about 10 seconds...so if you are looking for a relaxing deep stretch I would not recommend this video. I use this for a quick pre-work out stretch."
1,"I wanted to like this DVD, but it was awful","Way to much talking! Why would the instructor spend sssoooo much time talking. It was grating.This DVD starts with, what else, explanations of of the stretches, a short anatomy lessons, the instructors opinions about physical fitness. After all that, there is a short preview of the 10 poses you are ""going"" to do. Then, a 7 minute routine (still more talking during this) of the first 10 pose stretch.After that, there are more lessons, more talking and a short explanation of poses 11-20 (or something like that). Then more talking and another 7 minute routing of these poses. Why not put everything together. Do not waste you money on this one...there are too many good stretch/yoga DVD's out there."
3,G-shock,"It was a little smaller than I expected. I bought it for my oldest son , but saw how small it was and I gave it to my 11 year old son instead ."
1,Casio G-Shock 2900 Doesn't Do It,This watch was given to members of the press at CES 2007 in January of the same year. Since that time the watch has been in repair twice due to button malfunction. When it worked it was fine. Just before service was necessary a button or buttons would begin to make a squeaking noise followed by failure. This watch may have a battery good for 10 years. but the greatest pleasure I received from this product was gained by throwing it in the trash.
3,Alarm too soft,"The watch face is a little smaller than some gshock watches. I use the alarm a lot and this is much softer than any Casio watches I have had in the past. Other than that it is a basic watch with multiple time zones, 4 alarms, count down timer and stopwatch. Watchband will fit smaller wrists."
1,Bad Watch,"Well, it ran well for the first year. Then the display started fading when you press any of the buttons.Changed batteries twice. No use. Dont waste your money."
4,Seems Ok.,"I got this and am returning it. The watch itself seems nice, but the band is too small for me. I am on the last slot, so it is awkward. The display is very clear, and about 1/4 recessed from the shields of the G-shock, so I doubt it would get damaged very easily. If the band was longer, I'd keep it. Love the idea of the 10 year battery."
3,Alan Kline Rip OFF!!,"Alan Kline who owns all the rights to the Stones early recordings did a great thing in 2002 when he repackaged and release all the Stones early albums. But this time it is a pure rip off, you know The Stones have nothing to do with these releases, the only reason I gave this three stars is out of respect for the music, but if you want to pay $50.00 just to see alot of pictures go head, but if you want alot of music the 2002 re-release of the hits packages would be your best bet."
1,Worst rip off ever,"Seriously, this is probably the worst of the Rolling Stones recent rip-offs. First, the whole charging over $20 for a hybrid-SACD remasters thing, now this. Not only must you be a hardcore Rolling Stones fan to buy this, you must also be rich. $82??? When all of this could fit onto ONE CD. Unbelievable."
3,Rolling Stones,An overpriced set considering all the material would fit on one disc. Graphics were disappointing not seeing the original US London labels on the discs. Only a die-hard fan will be buying set two and three.
4,Great book; mediocre layout,"This is an excellent, authoritative book on maples; however, the layout is disappointing. All the color plates are lumped into two sections, rather than placed adjacent to relevant text. The result is very unsatisfying."
2,Tries to do too much,"The book is a contradiction in a sense. It is supposed to help those new to options trading understand it, but by covering both futures and stock options simultaneously I only ended up confused. I am interested in learning stock options and the books primary focus seems to be on futures. Perhaps having two books dedicated to each of the subjects would be more appropriate for a ""beginners"" book. In addition, the early introduction of examples about ""offsets"" are very confusing and, again for a ""beginners"" book, not appropriate at such an early stage."
1,"poorly written, confused me more than taught me","I bought this book a few years ago and have tried to read it many times. It is very poorly written in that it jumps around from topic to topic constantly. In trying to explain the lingo of options, it ended up confusing me more and I think I have lost knowledge by reading it.I'm moving on to ""Getting Started in Options"" based on its reviews and I hope it is better."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on. The publisher should let this expire worthless.,I was introduced to options with this book around 1999. As I tried to read it again today 8 years later with much gained experience I realized how poorly written and edited this book is. I'm sure it's not the editor's fault as they are most likely not familiar with derivatives. Even the basics of options are botched in this poor excuse of a book. The author emphasizes that you be clear in communication with your broker when taking/offsetting positions. How ironic. The author is not even capable of basic math. 5000 x $.01 = $500? or 5000 x $.02 = $1000? Sad. The product of our American public school system? Don't bother and look elsewhere. You'd be hard pressed to find anything more poorly written than this.
1,Buy at your own peril,The producers of this CD are sticking up two fingers to the listener here. Shocking audio. I could've done better with my old Bush tape recorder from the tele. In fact I think this is just what they did. The songs are lost in the screech and the squalor of this ear-shattering melee. The music would be great if only it had been treated with some respect (or any respect!)Complete waste of my (or anyone's) money!
1,Fraud,"The shirt they send is NOT this shirt. It is an ORANGE T shirt, with the sleeves cut off with""Hulkamania"" across the chest. I would not have paid this price for the shirt they sent me. It does not look an authentic Hogan style shirt at all, just a cheap knock-off. Pretty fraudulent that you have a shirt advertised on your website and you send a different shirt. Great business strategy. I sent a complaint via, I'll let you know what they respond with."
1,False advertisement!,This shirt looks nothing like what's in the picture.. It is orange and is made cheaply. It's maybe worth $5.00. I want my money back Amazon!
5,"Great, speedy delivery. My dad thinks he's ""Hulk Hogan""!","The item was ordered on a Friday, and was delivered Monday morning. My dad is reliving his ""Wrestlemania"" days thanks to this shirt! Can't beat the deal. Hope this helps. -E."
2,FLucking disappointed,i wanted a tank top LIKE the one hulk hogan would wear.. .i think it's called a T-bar tank top or something. even an a-top tank top woulda been better. this is a sleeveless t-shirt... oh well.
1,"Without a doubt, NOT GUILTY","I like Mr. Rob's review of the book. I gave ita 2 b/c it must have been hard for Marcia toreveal her steamy encounter with a hotel doorguy in Europe at age 17. Could have included more details on that.I am gonna pardon her for being so bitter and filled with wrath. Cuz when a person is angry, she often say things she doesn't really mean.With her talent, even if she is not practicing law, I believe Marcia can prevail in other areas. Such as be a good mother and take care of her two boys.Say Mr. Darden is married, am I not correct.??"
1,The Final Verdict,"For OJ to be guilty, you must believe that he quickly disposed of the bloody clothes, shoes, and knives so they would NEVER be found, yet brought the socks and glove back to his home! And then smeared blood all over the console!The coroner who did the autopsies testified ""the forensic evidence says the murders occurred after 11PM"". The limousine driver testified he brought OJ to the airport at that time. When you read this book, note how they avoid discussing these facts."
1,She should be DISBARED,She belongs in jail for impersonating a Lawyer. SHE is the reason the OJ Simpson is walking the streets. This book shows what an egotistical person she was/is.
1,Where's the beef.,"She tells a narrowly focused story, but I really expected to hear how the trial effected her AFTER the verdict. She is also very candid about the fact that she thinks everybody else screwed something up that made her job harder (I agree). Quizical and confused..probably a good read if you're a lawyer."
4,I Broke My Vow,"I pledged to never read one of the multitude of books on the OJcase, but I found this book for only ( )--couldn't pass it up.What a great view of what the majority of Americans thought had happened during the ""Trial of the Century."" The most startling and disappointing aspect of the investigation and trial was the vulnerability to celebrity of many involved. The shameful way Judge Ito pandered was recorded each day, but to find that jurors and even investigating officers fell prey to celebrity was disgusting.Marcia Clark does not paint herself as a ""victim."" Nor does she come off as the loveable heroine. She is quite honest about her mistakes, both personal and professional. And it was the case of her career which ultimately ended her prosecuting professession. She knew she would never again get a ""high-profile"" case and feared that future cases would become high-profile. A selfless gesture?"
1,"Marcia Clark, author, inept Attorney.","A gabby piece of literature. Why this woman let the defense team in the Simpson trial, hand-pick a sympathetic jury, and later, she wonders why she lost the trial... I am dumbfounded. Where did she get her law degree? Toys R us? Send a woman to do a man's job..."
2,Doesn't Answer Bugliosi,"This is a poorly written book. Its more about her and her feelings than the evidence and trial strategy. I was hoping she would defend herself against Bugliosi's critical comments in ""Outrage,"" but she virtually ignored them. Perhaps because there is no defense."
1,Clark proves beyond a doubt that she is a bozo,"After reading this book I have become convinced, beyond areasonable doubt, that Ms. Clark is indeed as big a bozo as sheappeared to be on national television.Guilty as charged."
4,Strength and courage to walk this walk.,"If nothing else we must acknowledge the fact that Marcia Clark had a fortitude and steadfastness that many lack in todays society. She believed in her fight and worked day and night for the truth to be revealed. I admire her will and ability to keep on even when she was blasted by so many. I enjoyed the book, believed he was guilty by the facts presented and all the DNA evidence if nothing else. A great read if you are looking for the truth."
4,Against all odds . . .,"Happened upon this book just before Simpson's recent comeuppance - what goes around comes around - sentence. It is an excellent account by the prosecuting attorney on the against all odds obstacles she and her team faced during this murder trial : inept police follow up, a wet-behind-the ear judge and a mostly black jury whose sole concentration during this trial focused on the irrevelant question of racism. The not guilty verdict rocked the world and must surely have divided the races of the USA back to the days of civil rights."
2,Here they come...,Here they come...People who wish to cash in on someone elses' success. This movie is far from what I expected. The 2+ hours from that cheap grainy camera for his deposition was one complete waste of film. Had I read this in someones' review I would've given things a second thought. The interview with Martin Bashir was so-so. I don't recommend this film to any true Jackson fan.
2,MICHAEL JACKSON THE INTERVIEWS VOL 2,"THIS DVD GAVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE MICHAEL JACKSON IN A NEW LIGHT, BUT AT TIMES THE DVD WAS DISCOLORED AND POINT LESS. IT WAS ALSO BORROWING AND IT WAS MISREPRESENTED OF WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT. I THOUGH THE DVD WOULD BE SHOW MORE OF PAST INTERVIEWS HE DID ON TELEVISION. I DON'T REGRET BUYING IT BUT I JUST EXPECTED BETTER."
2,I felt bad for Michael while watching this,"I bought this DVD really just to be able to see and hear Michael, and hopefully to learn something new. The only part of the DVD I enjoyed was the first set of three, which was a part of his at home interview collection. That was fun to see. The other two parts consisted of 3.5 hours of part of Martin Bashir's interview and some sort of interrogation of Michael from 1993, regarding his music and whether or not he wrote or co-wrote them and if he stole any of them. It was ridiculous and sad to watch but I couldn't turn it off. I felt bad for Michael and wanted these lawyers to leave him alone. I wish this and any and all of those other horrible things said and done to him never happend. I would not recommend this volume. I did enjoy most of volume 2 however. He was a beautiful human being inside and out. I miss him greatly and will always love him. He will forever and always be in my heart."
2,Details,yes it would be nice to know what we are buying and who we are supporting. Once again just putting MJ's name on it to profit. = (
3,confusing,I got this in the mega box set. Some of the interviews are really good. Some of them the quality stinks. The Japan one for instance I had to turn my volume up to blast off in order to hear it. I loved the interview at his home where he shows us his llama Louey that was precious and he seemed happy at times in it. I didn't understand the point of the deposition interview after he had oral surgery and was obviously in pain. They asked him after a break if he had taken a pain killer (duh!) and he said he had. The pill took effect and he was groggy and had trouble remembering what he had said on a previous deposition. What was the point of this?I found it disturbing and cruel to show him that way! I cried when they showed the left out scenes from the Bashir (horrid man) documentary. Michael on his bed so sad and hurting. If only he had found someone who loved him enough to really help him I believe he would still be here with us.
3,"IF THIS IS THE ""MICHAEL JACKSON TAPES""","If this is the tapes from Rabbi Schmulley I would not buy them,Schmulley lied about whay he ""cut ties"" with MJ. He was a spiritual advisor and I do not believe these were tapes that were meant to be heard. I did read some of the book-standing in Wal Mart and it is amazing listening to MJs take on things...however shmulley should ahve known it would be twisted by some readers and media (just see how they tore into what he said about Madonna) Another Rabbi has come out and slammed Schmulley for printing his book-counseling sessions are always recorded but they are not to break confidentiality.I don't know what this is or if it is even that-just ssyin."
1,The fact that we don't know...,"The fact that we don't know...is reason to question whether we want to pre-purchase it. Why the secrecy? Why isn't it published up front about the identity of the creator and content of these interviews? That is reason enough for us not to buy...until we know who and what we are supporting. Like someone said, it seems that everyone is out to make a quick buck at the expense of the legendary MJJ."
4,AWESOME!,"I love all interviews with MJ as he could always hold his own. Always smiling, always polite. I bought both 1 & 2 and really love the one with opera talking between clips after his death. Its heartwarming, funny, entertaining and sometimes a bit sad. But all in all, its a great thing to have if you are an MJ fan."
3,slightly off-track,"Svengali, Rasputin, Martin. If what Mr. Kaiser says in this book is true, then it's too bad that Malachi (why does Kaiser spell it Malachy?) Martin died before INTERPOL, and whatever other law enforcement agencies should be interested, got to him.I'm not Catholic and I don't think the story in Mr. Kaiser's book is Vatican II at all. The story is about a master con-man and even a cult master of international proportions.Malachi Martin is connected so much like a spider to so many people and ""things"" that someone ought to do a really IN DEPTH rundown on the man. I live in a little, out-of-the-way midwestern state, I'm not Catholic, and even I know of people connected in a bizarre, almost cult-like way to Martin and perhaps a mysterious, grissly, unsolved murder or two.I don't think that Martin was incapable of it, assuming that what Mr. Kaiser says in this book is indeed ""a true story."""
2,Not Too Great A Book,"I am a pastor who is not charismatic, so I am somewhat sympathetic to the author's viewpoints. But I cannot recommend this book because, in my opinion, he strains the Scriptures to prove his point. We all may have agendas when we go into Scripture study, but one must arrive at conclusions the right way (with a genuine openess to the meaning of Scripture).John MacArthur's book, ""The Charmismatics,"" would be a much better read. MacArthur comes to similar conclusions but treats the Scriptures with fairness, not straining them."
3,"Good book, was not as shown","I love this book. Marion Thiede not only writes a good story behind the tunes, she also did a wonderful job transcribing the fiddle tunes in both traditional & altered violin tuning in a way a classically trained violinist can understand & includes several pictures of historic, old time fiddlers.I was expecting the appearance of the book to be like the picture shown, with the black & white cover, etc. Instead, I received an old, hard fabric bound, discarded library book from Loudoun high school library...car dealers call it ""Bait and Switch"". (thus, only 3 stars)The description says (I cut & pasted this from the seller's statement) The Fiddle Book: The Comprehensive book on American folk music fiddling and fiddle styles, including more than 150 traditional fiddle tunes, compiled from country fiddlers (Paperback)I do like (and will keep) the book, but would have preferred that the item I actually received would have been shown on the seller's page."
4,The Best Dog Shampoo,"This is our favorite. We have two Golden Retrievers and Vets Best make them clean and smell soooooo good! I always dilute this just a little because it is very concentrated, but mostly because it's EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE (why is dog shampoo more expensive than mine!), so I use it about every other bath. All of the Vets Best formulas are very effective, but we just LOVE the scent. Wish this was more affordable so I could use it all the time."
5,Excellent shampoo,I have used this product for the last five years and it is great. I have dogs with grass allergies and this helps sooth their skin. I only bathe my dogs once a month and this keeps them smelling fresh for the entire time. I also do only natural flea control (the chemicals make my small dog sick) and the tea tree oil in tis shampoo it a key component it keeping fleas and ticks off my dogs. Since I have been using this i have lived on a horse ranch and currently live in a rural area and this still helps with flea control. I would definitely recommend this product.
2,Too harsh for Chihuahuas,"I tried this because the vet's best allergy tablets are superb. Unfortunately, one application of the shampoo, thoroughly rinsed off, and all the dogs had red bellies and more itching. return was simple and pleasant, probably worth a try if your dog is not as sensitive."
1,It's good for my dog,I like it for him. His fur feels so soft aqfter using this product. What else can I say. Great.
1,No itch relief,"This was recommended to me because my dog suffers year-round itching from dust allergy. After using it 2 different times, I was extremely disappointed with the results. I think the strong smell actually attracted mosquitoes to him, and he had NO relief in his itching. Also caused some flakes on his backside. Won't be using anymore of it."
2,Concerned,Ordered for brother's dog & it arrived leaking. Brother got it in his eye but with constant flushing with water he can not get burning under control. Inconvenient. Would appreciate a replacement at no cost & since he is in another state & has health issues I want him to keep the first bottle for the inconvenience. I hope this is fair & would be happy to remove this.Also with the burning very concerned on reaction on the dog. Will it be ok?
2,Save your MONEY,"The information found on the edocumuent - Contemporary Authors/Cyril Houle can be found on multiple web pages for free! Don't wast your money downloading this document.Oh well, I needed another source for my paper. I just don't want you to make the same mistake!Celeste"
1,Irresponsible packaging verification,"I've read other reviews where the 36"" chain was not in the package, which clearly states in BIG BLACK Letters on the box: ""Included 36"" inch Chain"" unfortunately I am one of those reviewers minus a chain, camping trip in two days.... Very disappointing! PRIME membership is useless if you can't get what was ordered. PRIME Irresponsibility!"
2,"Made in CHINA, not America","Paid 3 times the price for this tripod because it was Lodge brand, and the Lodge website says all their products are made in America. I was steamed when it arrived in a box marked 'Made in China'. Texsport makes a better and cheaper one, and at least they admit it's made in China in the description.Country of origin matters these days (probably should have always mattered, but it really matters now)."
3,Saw it coming,"It is everything it needs to be for my purposes and I am sure I will get years of service from it. As I figured, after reading the reviews, before I ordered, I too did not receive a chain with the tri-pod. Please send me my chain to make this a great buy for me. 5 star for tri-pod with quick delivery but I gave it a 3 star for no chain."
4,Missing Storage Bag,"As usual, the item came in a timely fashion and everything looked great, except it seemed as though the storage bag displayed in the photo was missing. After re reading the description I realize that it did not mention the storage bag specifically, although it shows it quite prominently in the picture. The description of the item does not say the bag is sold separately, either. We paid more for this item vs the others offered believing a storage bag was included."
3,Average,"I am a huge fan of Boyle's and I thought this book lacked his usual nervy humor and it was definitely not a page turner. Although it's about Kinsey and sex sex sex it actually got sort of redundant and boring. With Boyle's unigue talents I would think he'd be one of the last writers in the world who could make sex boring, but perhaps he was just being faithful to his subject. I was really disappointed."
1,Boyle had no point,"The very first review by Douglas A. Greenberg hit the nail on the head. On finishing the book I felt Prok was a monster, Milk a wuss, and Milk's wife the only character with balls.As I read thru this novel, it came across too much as autobiographical by a notional participant and seemed to lack a clear fictional focus... I kept asking myself: ""What's the author's point?"" but never found an answer. A novelist who only reports life but does not illuminate it shortchanges the reader.Not a satisfying book. I've recently read a few books by Michael Cunningham, and Boyle's book seemed gutless and colorless in comparison."
2,"Okay, but unlikeable characters",This book wasn't awful and I finished it (it wasn't one of those ones so bad you just stop reading). But the characters were so unlikeable it was hard to really get into the book. Glad it was a library book and I didnt spend money on it!
2,Missed something,"After I read Drop City I grabbed The Inner Circle.Not a good book. TC has a very interesting cogent style but this book was a bit thin in story. I'd suggest bypassing this novel for Drop City, a delightful read."
2,Well below the level one would expect of this author,"I doubt this book ever would have been published had it not been for Kinsey's being a popular subject at the moment. Though the writing does capture a sense of what it may have been like to be involved with Kinsey's research, there is little enhancement of the facts which one may see on any site about Kinsey.The characters are poorly drawn, dialogue very weak. What I had thought would be an interesting and well-developed piece of characerisation and plot grew boring very quickly."
2,Now Really?,"What is the point of this book? Can the readers relate to the book? What is the idea we are selling? The nation was at war and they were exploring the human animal. The premise is not only stupid but a clear insult to intelligent people.I do not believe the writer developed the PROK character to suggest why he did have control of Milk's life. It also does not explain why PROK'S wife MAC went with it all.Some time, specially after 150 pages the book is pure rambling without any direction!!I am pretty disappionted with the book because of its lack of direction.Since I am not getting any good voteswhy not read the real book BY KINSEY?"
2,2.5 stars divided,"I would give the writing 5 stars. I stayed with the book all the way through because of it. I give the story line 1 star. The subject matter in this historical fiction book eventually succeeded in grossing me out. I didn't care for the characters and I admit, I like to be able to relate in SOME way to at least one. Prok was a charasmatic cult leader who appeared to be living out his own personal fantasies in the name of science. Whatever. Has all this knowledge of how many times a day someone partakes in self-gratifying behavior really benefited society? [...] Milk drove me nuts. I kept hoping his wife would be the redeeming character in the whole book but I felt let down by her too. As a mother and RN when the mention of infant and child sex came up I was physically repulsed. I wish I'd thrown the book down then and moved on."
3,Skip it,"T.C. Boyle is a competent writer, but that's the extent of it in this slow novel that is dry of wisdom. Skip it."
5,cool cd,"it's great for kids to listen it encourages them to give there life to JESUS CHRIST and i meet dcp in person,him and l.g.wise,they came to my church in albany,ga. the evangelical faith vision ministeries inc.my pastors are the name is APOSTLE ISIAH REVILLS AND MOTHER ULANIEE REVILLS and that's i like this cd so much,and i would like to buy it please ,THANKS CHRIS JONES"
4,I became an expert making treats with this little book!,Shows how to make almost any kind of old fashioned soda fountain treat. Pictures in color. Easy to follow instructions. Treat your grandchildren to favorites enjoyed during your childhood. Who cares about the calories. Enjoy happy memories making these treats.
4,An introduction to the soda fountain.,"This tiny book is a great introduction to the soda fountain and the elements of soda fountain desserts. There are a few recipes each for sundaes, shakes, sauces, lady-fingers, and ice cream cones. Not very in depth but has good color photos and the recipes that are included are very good. Nice to add to a collection. It includes instructions for making the famous egg cream."
1,Great for a table coaster!,"The say never judge a book by its cover...well, this is definitely one of them. I was highly disappointed with all the content; Little imagination, nothing original and boring recipes. Save you money!!"
5,Buckners of Virginia,Classic - this makes a valuable addition to my genealogy library and adds an ease in documenting points in lineage. A copy of an older out of print book I felt lucky to obtain a personal copy and not have to go to a library and make copies of the relevant pages.
3,This is not a Tom Russell CD.,"While Tom has done two wonderful collections with Barrence, please be aware that this cd is a Barrence Whitfield and the Savages CD.....without the involvement of Tom Russell."
4,Blackfly Season,This was a lovely read. My brother-in-law recommended it because I live in the area where the story was written. Always fun to recognize the various locations mentioned even though the names are altered.
1,Black Fly Season,"Excellent writing. The physical book was flawed. Page 279 becamea Dash With Death written by Claudia Bishop. Page 311, it went back to Black Fly SeasonJune Box"
3,Procedural,"Perhaps starting in the middle of a series has lessened the impact, but I found this to be just average. I'll have to go and look for the beginning."
5,Cardinal and Delorme really shine,"This novel, the third in the Cardinal/Delorme series continues the action in a small Canadian town with the two dedicated detectives hot on the trail of a vicious and elusive killer. The novel moves along quite well with the reader constantly wondering if the police can outdo the bad guy. Delorme and Cardinal are a great pair of characters and the author really plays them off each other very convincingly. Cardinal seems to be more fleshed out in this story. We learn more about his distrubed wife and other demons he has to deal with. I would like to see more about the Delorme character in the next novel which can't come too soon. This is a really good series."
3,Missing a tool,"Did not include a tool I needed to install. I tried to figure out how to put it together, and could only find tutorials that required a special tool I could not find."
4,Calloused hands help with assembly,"I like this gimbal, but putting it together requires a little effort. You'll need to snap the little metal joints into the plastic pieces by prying apart the tabbed housing. It's not exactly easy or intuitive, but it works perfectly once it's together."
3,Confusion of albums - Aled as treble vs baritone,"I like Aled Jones' treble voice well enough, which this album showcases, the cover notwithstanding. However, I REALLY like his mature voice, but unfortunately his new-in-2004 album, for which the cover art is displayed as of 12-20-2011, is only available on amazon.co.uk, and is not available to US residents. (Compare the song lists and the musical samples at the UK and US sites.) Curiously, I can't find the earlier album even on Jones' own web site. I discovered the confusion of albums when trying to purchase tracks I had heard on Pandora. com."
1,Switch and Bait,"On Amazon website I listen to a preview of a song on this album. I liked it so I bought the album. Turns out the song isn't even on here, but it gets better. The song I wanted was when Aled was just a boy, this album he is a full grown middle aged man.Anyway the album is so boring I have never listen though it in it's entirety as I have fallen a sleep each time. That being said if you are looking for a something to fall a sleep to, buy this."
1,I don't like it. Low quality,"There are two things i don't like. One is the product's smell. For me, the smell of Simple Solution was overly strong, unpleasant and persistent. the other disappointment is that the nozzle does not have a stream option. The products i'd used before had 4 positions on the nozzle, Stream, Spray and Off (2 off positions) as you turn the nozzle around. This product only had two Off positions and two Spray positions, no Stream position. This was a huge problem for me, for the purposes i use this for. Sometimes i need a stronger more concentrated stream that i can aim at the stain. Other times i want a spray to cover a larger area and not penetrate as deeply. I want to have both options. Most cleaning bottles i've used and other pet odor bottles had both options. I really couldn't believe Simple Solution would omit something that basic and important. But they did. I tried it again and again in disbelief--two spray positions, two off positions, that was it"
1,Odor Remover? You must be kidding,The so-called cure is worse than the problem. This product smells horrible. Just walking by the room almost makes me throw up. I've no clue how to get the stench out of the carpet.
5,A virulently baroque daydream,"Anyone fantasizing about a catholic church led by an ambitious, (relatively) young, energetic, charismatic, intelligent, prescient, and competent pope, must read this book and realize it's already been fantasized about to a truly wondrous extent. An idealization of theo-autocracy, Hadrian the Seventh bears comparison (if only for giggles) with GK Chesterton's works. Delightful, morbidly absurd and surprisingly engaging, Baron Corvo's quasi-wistfully-autobiographical novel is the epitome of what-ifs, a seminal exposition in the art of might-have-beens."
4,Made in America,"The cornstick pans are perfect, a cooking classic. The pans are heavy - cast iron, and small. The larger pan plus the smaller one both fit in my DeLongi toaster oven -- just what I wanted. MADE IN USA!"
5,PRE-SEASONED CORNSTICK PAN,I love thhis cornstick pan. It was well worth the price. I use it at least twice a week.
4,Reminds the pilot to consider ALL aspects of mountain flying,"This is a good book that reminds the pilot to consider all aspect of mountain flying, not just the challenges of high altitude, unusual approaches and short airstrips. There is significant information about aircraft performance at high density altitudes, special weather considerations in the mountains, techniques for evaluating mountain airstrips, flying non-standard approach patterns. It is not as exciting a read, nor does it give as much attention to specific aircraft handling skills as F.E. Potts' ""Guide to Bush Flying,"" but is the recognized standard for an armchair introduction to piloting an aircraft in the mountains and should find a place on any pilot's bookshelf."
3,A different kind of Zane Grey,"Nothing is new under the sun. This could be true now, To think this was written about 1920 is amazing it just goes to show how people haven't changed. The story is about a young man who returns from WW1 after being in battle for 3 years many battle scars and emotional wounds. Coming home was a dream that turned into a nightmare. It was written in ZG great style but it is not a western, but I really enjoyed it."
2,Not at all what I expected,I was not able to finish this book - it was a depressing story of the solders returning home after WWI. I am sure it is accurate but I had a hard time keeping up with the story and finally gave up on it. I don't do this very often. I have read other books by Zane Grey and have enjoyed them. This one however I probably never finish.
5,Good read,I can't beat Zane Grey for a good read. I have read them all and enjoyed every one. Most are free also!
5,Excellent business energizer for all business cultures,"The kind of stories that ""Art"" tells about in his book, makes me remember that whenever in trouble, specially in business, there's always someone, somewhere, sometime, that has overcome much worst difficulties. There is always a solution for every / anything in life, except for death. We all choose our attitude when facing different situations.Oth√≥n Le√≥n, M√©xico City, M√©xico."
2,not very good,I was disappointed to see that the pore size of this product is larger than many known allergens.
4,The Quiet Gentleman,"As always, Georgette Heyer spins a very good story with a twist. Very entertaining. For those who enjoy reading a light romantic story set in period times you will enjoy this book."
5,Quiet Gentleman,Perfect as usual for Georgette Heyer. Great plot depth and clean writing. She can describe and set the setting in a few choice words. Also she has brought her strong female characters out and into the plot. An excellent read!
3,Okay,"Honestly, it is a rather boring book. I really had to force myself to get through this one. I didn't really take to the players. There was little character development, so you felt like you were on the outside and not embracing them. Lots of castle description as another reviewer pointed out. I enjoyed Toll Gate and Grand Sophey. This one I could have skipped."
4,"Great story, light on romance","I really enjoyed this story all the way through. It is a very well-done book. There's humor a la Jane Austen, suspense, and light romance. Very light. You love the protagonists, but it takes a LONG time to find out that they love each other. I don't think it necessarily sprang up out of the blue, but it is hard to see. Great book, and if you don't mind that the romance doesn't really figure in too much until the end, go for it!!"
3,Not one of Heyer's best,"An indifferent Heyer novel, however, is worth three books by a lesser author.My problems with this book are that I found it difficult to like the protagonist (I didn't dislike him, either; I simply found him uninteresting), I found the plot very easy to predict, and the romance seemed to me to spring up out of the blue. Most of Heyer's novels are much better than this, with beautifully-drawn characters and believable romances.If this were by anyone else, I probably would have given it 4 stars, but it's only an average Heyer novel and not an outstanding one."
3,Not her finest hour...,"Too much description of the Castle, too many uninteresting characters-I cannot like the heroine, and don't feel very drawn to the hero either. Cannot begin to compare with the best of Ms. Heyer's work. I read it right after re-reading ""Frederica"" which was probably unfair, but ""Gentleman"" really suffered by comparison! Can't really recommend it."
3,"Enjoyable, not excellent","Triumph is the first SP book I've read after the original story. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't excellent. I found the beginning to be very drawn out; it took me a very long time to read the first 75 pages or so, before it got going. Once it did start, (with Theresia and SP meeting for the first time) I found it to be fast paced, and I looked forward to reading it. However, the long beginning brought it down to a 3 star book for me. Also, the ending wasn't really explained at all...one second, literally, Robespierre is the tyrant in charge, next paragraph, well, no spoiler, but suffice to say he's not. Even in real life, the change was not so dramatic, and surely Orczy could have written a page or two more explaination.Furthermore, I was disappointed that while St. Just, Andrew, and Tony were mentioned, that was about it; they were barely in the picture at all.A fun adventure.....but not much more than that."
5,Loved it!,"Loved it - a must for any Scarlet Pimpernel fan! I read the original years ago but only recently discovered that Orczy had written numerous sequels, and I'm enjoying every one! Working through the plot twists is like following Columbo as he tries to solve a mystery; it's no surprise that Orczy also wrote detective novels. The whole concept is just so much fun! Interestingly, though, she remains true to the historical reality of the period at the same time. Enjoy!"
5,Good and Bad,"I bought this book for my wife who loves the series. She said that the book was excelent, but beware, the editing is HORRIBLE. You have to be prepared to translate quite a few words in the text. It must have been edited by a computer becuase no human could be such an idiot. She said that it is kind of funny after a while, but she did enjoy the book."
2,Slow start to the series,"This was the second Mickey Rawlings book I read and I thought the ""Cincinnati Red Stalkings"" was much better. I thought that the characters in ""Murder at Fenway Park"" were not very well-developed or differentiated from each other. I also thought that most of the middle of the book consisted of Mickey going from here to there without advancing the plot or doing much detecting. I look forward to reading the other books in the series but don't recommend this one."
4,introduction to phonetics,This is a good introduction to homeschooling preschoolers in phonetics by an experienced Montessorian.
4,"Great Workout, Just Not For Me","Although I would call myself an advanced stepper in terms of stamina and strength, I'm completely hopeless with routines that are more than basic athletic steps. Rob Glick is a fantastic instructor and the routines are great for the right person (if you like Christi Taylor or Cathe Freidrich, you'll love Rob Glick), but despite stubborn efforts on my part, I just can't master his style.If you consider yourself an advanced stepper and are very familiar with both dance and step terms and are comfortable with routines that continually change, you'll really like this workout. If, like me, your favorite step workouts are more basic (Gin Miller, Gilad, Kathy Smith), you might struggle with the frustration level you'll encounter with this workout."
5,It's SADE!!,"If you're a TRUE and DIE-HARD - SADE - fan then you must have this CD! Enough said!!!! Sit back, relax and enjoy some of SADE's more popular hits in a jazz sax way...this CD will soothe your SADE inspired soul."
5,My Dog Loves It,It was easy to use and soft enough for my little dogs fur and skin. She also loved it when I brushed her cause she gets hot spots that itch and a regular comb/brush is too hard and hurts her. All in all a great product.
2,Looks Nice...,"While the rubber grip is nicely made, if falls a little short. I didn't feel that it was a good scrub brush, it did not feel right or lather well. To make matters worse the bottle leaked..."
1,Applicator not effective,"The applicator is a hard 2 ounce plastic bottle which you fill with shampoo, BUT, impossible to squeeze shampoo out of. The body brush is nice and soft, so my dog liked it. If you are looking for a shampoo applicator that is easy to squeeze do not buy this one."
1,dog shampoo brush,This is definitely not worth wasting your money on. It doesn't hold enough shampoo for any dog bigger than a chihuahua and the bristles are so large and rubbery that they stick in the fur and you can't get a good lather up. Would not recommend it.
5,Experience is Relevant,"As the author of this book, I happy to hear criticism and welcome people sending me their opinions. However, it is important for people to understand that this book is for people who have have no experience with beta testing or are looking to improve an existing program.If you have already a successful beta program, you do not need this book. If you have years of experience in conducting tests, this book will only confirm what you know. It is focused on best practices.If you have a beta program and it doesn't work or if you have never beta tested before, then I believe you will get a lot of benefit from this book(...)"
5,excellent service; great quality,book arrived by promised date in promised quality. would certainly do business with seller again. book is an interesting read for anyone in the beta testing business.
2,Tell me something I don't already know,"I was disappointed with this book. I've worked 10+ years asa software developer and manager so I guess I've seen everythingbecause this book didn't present any ideas/processes thatI hadn't seen from working in the industry. The examplestended to be cute little stories which were lacking any realdepth. I would have rather seen some real ""war"" stories writtenup in detail. This isn't a keeper"
5,Not just Waikiki,This book is great. It is set up according to region and then by activity. We did several of the hikes and they were great.
5,GOTTA HAVE IT!,"I just got back from a week trip to Kauai last month and this book was a life saver! Anytime I veered from the book, I was either lost or got stuck eating not so good food. I feel like I really was able to make the most of my week by having this book to point me in the right directions. Everything about this book was great! If you're going to Kauai don't make the mistake of not having brought this book with you. It's absolutely a must! Enjoy Kauai, it's beautiful! Oh and Kipu Ranch Adventures is awesome ... just like the book said. Staff were great and I never thought I'd see such beautiful views. Two thumbs up!!"
5,Awesome travel book!,I purchased this book for my sister prior to her moving from CA to Oahu AND she loves it!!! Last year I purchased the same book covering the Big Island - I read it from cover to cover before vacationing on the Island and it was like being on a professional guided tour! I highly recommend this read and give all my thanks to the author for the wonderful memories!
5,Can't wait to use it!,Lots of information that you never would think of..highly recommend this book. No detail left unnoticed..from bus schedules ..maps..tours ..restaurants..even local no trespassing issue's! awesome book
4,Oahu Revealed,Was a very well done. Like the details in the book about hidden trails and beaches. The only thing is that I wish the maps were a little bigger.
2,okay,"Was just okay, used the same title book for Maui and was great. Did not agree with most of the things they suggested"
1,What a couple of cynics!,"I understand that the some of the layout of the book is helpful, especially the hotel placement in Waikiki. I live in Honolulu, and a friend of mine who visited us last week brought this book with him. We all found this book to be generally negative about places, and wondered if the authors had visited some of the places more than once before forming opinions. After we got over the negative offense of the book, it basically became more a target of our own bad humor.If you want a true experience of Oahu - I'd say make friends with a local. Otherwise, don't believe everything you read."
5,Great Book,This is definitely the best book and reference we could have purchased prior to our trip to Oahu. I downloaded the Kindle version and referred to it daily while on the island. The maps came in handy and the recommendations were spot on. Thanks to this book our trip was a memory of a lifetime.
5,Couldn't have found a better guide book.,"This guy is amazing, his books are so easy to read, he has all the information you need including phone numbers, prices, exact location and directions and all the secrets and tips he can offer. It was a nice read, he really knows his stuff and he's comical at the same time. I now feel prepared and safe to travel to this destination after reading this book."
5,Best Guidebook,"This series are by far the best Hawaiian guidebooks available. (See my review of the Doughty book on Hawaii.) You won't believe the detail in these books. You get hotel reviews, maps, and much more. Nothing was left out. All of this and access to a great website too! If you are going to the islands, get the whole series. You have to see them to believe it."
4,Book was spot-on for great things to do,"Without telling our Oahu dwelling friend what the recommendations were in this book, he ended up picking hikes and places to eat for us that were listed in this book as things to do. So, I'd regard this book as the real deal - these are the cool things you should do and see while you are on Oahu. We even taught our friend (who has lived there for 15 years) a thing or two based on what was written in the book. The only thing I didn't care for in this book was the writing style - it reminded me of one of those goofy tour guides who tries to inject comedy as much as possible. I'm all for a good laugh, but when I'm reading a guide book, I really just want to know the facts. I'd definitely buy this book for someone who was looking to vacation on Oahu if they don't already have a local contact."
5,Even the locals agreed this book is dead on accurate,"I spent 1 1/2 weeks on Oahu working with a client. I had a weekend and evenings to tour. Used this book extensively for maps, directions, weather information, restaurant reviews and places to go -- and avoid. In every instance my expectations were exceeded. The authors even include history of the spots (where appropriate). I would bring ""the book"" to the client each day, and they pointed out places I must see. Even they were impressed with the accuracy! Oahu Revealed is a ""must read"" for anyone who wants an enhanced view of what to expect when visiting!"
4,"Oahu Revealed: The Ultimate Guide to Honolulu, Waikiki & Beyond","All ""Revealed"" books have a lot of useful information about each island. Each needs to be used while planning your vacation and taking notes specific to what you are going to do."
5,This book is AMAZING just like Oahu,"I could not believe how easy this book made our trip to Oahu. Every thing we wanted to do it had tons of information! We never went anywhere without it! Even the questions of where do you want to eat- they have completely right, honest opinions of everything even down to the shave ice and shrimp shacks! Tons of info and ideas on activities and luau's...simply amazing! We bought and brought 3 other books, and I dont even think we bothered to open the others, this is the only one you'll need! I'm excited to visit the other islands now since they have a book for each Hawaiian island! :)"
5,Another great book by Mr. Doughty,"I have the book on Maui and have used it thoroughly. I didn't think I needed the Oahu book since I was stationed at Pearl Harbor for two years. I thought I knew the island pretty well. Well, not as well as I thought! This book pointed out new places, and certainly updated me with all the places I was familiar with and of course provided the absolutely new things. No one should leave home without it!"
2,Our first visit to Oahu,The pictures are pretty but that's about it. I was looking for a really great drive guide but found this to be sort of a regular guide. There were so many stops with tourists all over. I guess I expected too much.
3,This may be okay,"I traveled to the Big Island, thinking I would take an excursion to Ohau, which I didn't. I also purchased the book for the Big Island, and it served me pretty well, albeit it lacked some of my requirements, such as reviews of some restaurants, and locations of some coffee farms. I just suspect the same would hold for this book, I just don't know.The way I look at it, any additional info you may have for a location in which you find yourself should be considered good, I suppose. If I had it to do over, I don't think the cost of this book is worth it, what with the AAA Travel books being free of cost, and provide quite a bit information on the islands.These books tend to provide a lot of the history of the Islands, as opposed to a really good travel guide, but that may be what some travelers wish. I found it sufficient to learn the history of the islands on the internet and the library. Some may not wish to spend the necessary time to do this."
2,Oahu revealed,A waste of money. Outdated material. Nothing here I hadn't seen before. You should give me money credit on my next purchase.
5,Paid for itself the first day,This book saved us over$50.00 in free parking alone. Very informative. It brought us to sites that other tourists missed. This book really made our trip to Maui!
1,Poorly organized travel guide,"I have used a number of guides for Hawaii. This is the most poorly organized one of all. The author fails to group by location so when traveling to areas one must search through a number of sections to find sights, food, lodging and other essentials. The author is also completely wrong on the translantions and current usage of the Hawaiian language. Living on the island of Molokai with the largest native hawaiian population, one has an opportunity to hear how the words are currently used. They are certainly not as described by Doughty. Lonely planet is a much better guide."
2,Ipad kindle version has no photos,You cannot see the photos or maps needed on the kindle version of the book.The tips are much better on other islands.
5,Oahu Revealed,"This book was very helpful in our travels on Oahu. It showed us many sites we would have missed had we not had the book. It is clear, detailed, descriptive and always gave the right directions. We had rented a car and were able to see as many of the sites as we wanted. A must have when traveling in Hawaii!!"
5,Great travel book!,"My husband and I just got back from Oahu and before we left we bought this book. This book is a great tool and guide to Oahu. It tells you which locations are ""real gems"" and what is ""not to be missed!"" It also gives recommendations to locations that aren't as popular but definitely worth seeing. It is easy to use and also includes maps. It offers suggestions on what places to visit as well as dining and shopping. We used it every single day and we would have been lost without it! Definitely recommend this book to anyone visiting Oahu!"
5,Cover versus Content,"Admittedly, the cover is a little boring. But don't let that put you off. This is not a distant ""satellite view"" of Oahu. This is Oahu close up and alive. Of the Oahu guidebooks I have looked at, this is easily my first choice. Even if you're just going to stay in Waikiki, Oahu Revealed has great advice on hotels, restaurants, and things to see and do.But where the book becomes particularly valuable is in its descriptions of the rest of Oahu. For anyone wanting to know how to find great snorkeling, hidden beaches, fun surf, hiking trails, or anything else Oahu offers from kayaking to skydiving, this book can get you there. The descriptions are so compelling and intriguing that I've read the book through twice--and I'm still planning my trip. The cover may not catch your eye, but the interior is full of beautiful photography and thoroughly useful information."
3,outdated,"Probably an excellent book at the time of printing,but very outdated 2005. Many hotels, atractions and restaurant have been outdated and changed, so it is not really helpful in that area.Beautiful pictures and nice description of the island and its history"
4,Useful and full of information,"I purchased this book for a trip I was taking with my husband for our anniversary. I choose this book because not only did it look like it had a lot of general information, it also had a lot of fun facts and details that might be overlooked in other guidebooks. I was very pleased when I recieved the book and saw that it had all that I wanted. Not only did it have tidbits on everything I wanted, it also gave directions and recommendations from people who actually visited the location. I like knowing that the research is done and that I can rely on the information that's given me to. :)Only con would be that since it does have so much information it wasn't that convenient to bring with me everywhere we went. I just had to make sure I thoroughly read up on the locations we were going to when we didn't bring the book with us. I highly recommend this book for those who want to know more than an overview."
4,Best Missed Travel Book on Oahu,While this company does not do a great job with rating many hotels it is an awesome book written by people that live there. I originally checked out the Kauai book from the library then bought it and this one. I really feel like I got a better insight as to what I really want to do vs the more popular travel book companies. These people actually check out their picks without letting the companies know they are doing it. They do have two ratings for hotels that I like and used to pick my hotels out. My 16 yr old neice and I are going to have a better time because of these guys.
5,great book,this book was exactly what I was looking for. lots of information about eating and and playing. I would recommend it.
5,Best Guide Books for Hawaii,The only guide book that gives you current detailed information. They even post updates online between editions. Things tend to be poorly marked in Hawaii and so the mile marker details help get you where you want to be.
5,What every travel guide should be,"I'm a bit of a travel guide nut, and after buying everything I could about the island, this is the one I'm bringing with me to Oahu. Fun to read, opinionated, and chock-full of information, this is what I want to read, not just for the information, but for the insights and YES, for the writing! I made the mistake of putting this one on my nightstand to read before bed, and I couldn't stop."
5,Oahu Bible,My wife and I just spent 28 days in a rental house on Oahu. A copy of Oahu Revealed was on the coffee table. I had brought another guidebook with me. We ended up using Oahu Revealed exclusively. It is without doubt the best guidebook I have ever used for anywhere in the world and I have traveled extensively. It is a fabulous guidebook and no one should go to Oahu without it.
3,Not my favorite of Doughty's books,"We purchased this book because we were quite pleased with the Kauai and Maui books, but weren't as impressed with this book. This may be because our Oahu trip was our first to Hawaii with children, and these books aren't especially tailored to a family vacation. More descriptions of family-friendly events, more restaurant and hotel reviews and less really-off-the-beaten-path sites would have been preferred for our family vacation. However, if you are looking for a book that tells you more about the hidden Oahu, this is probably for you. As with the other books, the author is candid and fair."
3,Psylocke Light-Up action figure review,This toy is hot. The figure on that toy is just stunning.She looks like a super model. It also comes with others items but they are too small and easy to lose. The Light up bit is eighth rate at best. It's just one teeny/tiny light that grows and weakly I might add. Overall Buy it if you love Psylocke but don't buy it for the light up bit. I give this toy a 6 out of 10.
3,Psylocke,Well I like this toy. I wouldn't trust doing excessive motion with her. She was really cheap and I love old action figures so I bought her.
5,Soothing bedtime book....,"Originally I took this book out of the library to give it a chance and ended up renewing it twice. I loved it so much, that I bought it for my 18 month old daughter for Christmas. This book has eight different stories relating to different things; rain, birds, horses, trees, ocean, elephant, garden, heart, and they're somehow assoicated to music. The first time I read it, I almost fell asleep because I found it to be very soothing and the rhythm of the poems to be melodic. My husband felt the same way the first time he read it. It's definitely a good book to wind down for bedtime."
1,tapping on the wall is more accurate,"Ok, it *may* just be that my walls have textured paint on them, but even so, this thing is horrible. It claims there's a stud or *something* every few inches, and sweeping back over the spot multiple times may confirm or deny that. I took to sweeping an area several times from both directions to mark places that seemed to at least be consistent amongst the noise. After it was all done, I just took to tapping the wall to hear the reverberations to confirm. Get something else."
1,Same useless junk as the older model,"I guess it's pretty hard to make a stud finder / electrical finder the works at a decent price. I'm not sure what is updated about this model, as it's just as bad as the old one. Moving it over my textured walls makes it freak out 90% of the time and need to be reset. Sometimes it will lock up on the ""found a stud"" mode and stay there no matter where you move the unit to. If you press to hard on the unit to keep it firmly against the wall, it will make it find a stud or find AC wiring. Sometimes it says it has found AC wiring, and then if you reset it and scan it again, it finds nothing.Bottom line is, it gives so much conflicted data that it is useless. What good is a stud finder and AC wiring finder if you can't trust it? Great job Zircon."
1,This studfinder is garbage. complete waste of money!,"I picked this up after putting up some drywall to figure out where the studs were, and it was completely useless. 99% of the time, i missed the wood. i returned it the very next day.Zircon should be ashamed of themselves for even marketing and selling this garbage.NOT RECOMMENDED!"
1,Hammer solved the problem,"I actually found this stud finder to be accurate, though often took a few passes just to be sure. My problem was, over half the times I put it to the wall and pressed the button, it would just beep and the LCD and LED would just flash. Nothing I did would make it even pretend to work at that point. In the end, I took a hammer to it; problem solved. Complete waste of money, do not buy this thing!"
1,One star is very generous,"There is a trail of a single star for this item because it is a waste of money. And almost forgot: a waste of your time. Tap the wall you'll be more accrurate, I mean it. Or spent a little more."
4,Works when used properly.,"Works when used properly. As a previous reviewer mentioned, you have to hold it on an area and let it calibrate, then move it slowly until a stud is indicated. I usually do it a few times to verify."
1,Anything but Zircon,"This model of Zircon stud finder is completely useless and the company makes no effort to solve the problem. The tone and display give completely random signals indicating a stud whether there is one there or not. I emailed Zircon and after three weeks, no response. I bought the Hanson magnetic to replace the Zircon. Not so high tech and not as easy to use as the Zircon would be if it operated properly, but it gets the job done. Tapping on the wall is better than the Zircon."
5,Fully satisfied,"I bought this and I, am fully satisfied. It works wel, it is easy to use and meets my expectations."
1,Don't Insult Trash By Calling This Abomination Garbage,I bought this pretend studsensor at Lowe's in late 08 or 09. I tried it out and it seemed to find studs okay at the time but I didn't actually try to put a screw or nail into a stud at the time. Fast forward to Christmas 2010. I was trying to anchor my son's new computer desk unit to the wall. Unfortunately this hunk of plastic is only good at beeping and flashing an occasional red light. It couldn't find one stud through normal one layer drywall. Everywhere it saw a stud there was none to be found. I will never ever ever ever buy anything these thieves from Zircon make again. I wonder if they got anyone electrocuted with false readings. Don't buy this.
4,Unjustified bad rap.,"I just bought one of these at a local hardware store. It worked well for me. It was accurate enough to find the stud edges. I scanned a few times to confirm the stud locations and the repeatability was good. I think you have to put it on an area where you don't have a stud first, then wait for it to calibrate before scanning. I noticed that quite a few of the reviews are older. It is possible that Zircon improved this scanner, or, the problems reported were due to operator error or impatience. Anyway, I would recommend this product to a friend."
3,"Biological Psychology: An Introduction to Behavioral, Cognitive, and Clinical Neuroscience, Sixth Edition","The pages on this book are white clean and crispy. It contains a lot of great graphics and pictures all over and in colour. Very clear lettering making the reading easy and it is loaded with Biology, Psychology and Biological Psychology terminolgy."
4,Fun and cute link toy,Bought this for my 6 month old daughter. I like it because the links are a little harder to pull open so I can hook it onto a strap (carseat or stroller) and she can't pull it off easily. Very cute. Monkey's ears crinkle and there is a rattle in his body.
1,Not soft,"It wasn't as expected. The monkey was not very soft, quite hard. Our baby had to sit up to play with it because while laying down the teething rings can hit her on the head and leave a small mark."
4,Roasting Pan,I got this pan because I love the Cameron smoker. The pan is definitely heavy duty and can withstand the heat of my restaurant range. I am not crazy about the ridged bottom but all in all it's a good pan.
2,Made in China,says it all. Less than middle quality. Already off-chrome in many areas. Scared to use it but too much hassle to return it.
1,Disappointed,I bought the Teac system that was not remanufactured and was also very disappointed in the quality. The CD player did not even last 6 months! I would not buy another Teac product.
4,Fine for the price,"I bought this system over 5yrs ago after much research and ""review reading"". For the money it delivers well and has served me flawlessly these many years. Just don't expect it to perform like a high-end system that would cost 10X it's price. The unit is not built to be able to handle large rooms, but sound quality for a small one would be just fine. The compact size and sleek finish are it's strengths. I'm an audiophile and my main system dwarfs this one, yet I still feel this is a quality unit for the price."
5,satisfied,arrived before estimated date. many previous orders from this seller which always are on time and in excellent condition
2,SUCKS ON GAMECUBE!!!,"I have played the game on PS2 and I loved it! I heard that the XBOX version is a little better [probably because of graphics],but for the Gamecube, I think in my opinion it does not work at all! First, the controls for the GC version are much more hard to learn. Second, the graphics suck on GC! The only go graphics in the game are the cutscenes on GC. Anyway, if you have a GC, you can buy it as a collecters item if you liked the movie and comic books, anyone else, only rent it."
5,Addictive Reading,"This book has a story and characters anyone can relate to. These elements had me read the book from start to finish continuously. This is a definite must read, touching on morals without preaching about it."
2,Not impressed,"I ordered this book because it had such high ratings, howebver I didn't really get this book. It contained too much fantasy."
3,USE A MEASURING CUP!,"I love the concept of the disposal liners - no more bottles to clean! However, as one user mentioned, the measurements on the liners do not match the measurements on the bottles. When I measure out 6oz in a measuring cup and then pour into a liner, the reading on the bottle varied as much as 1oz! (the bottle read 7oz when there was only 6oz of water in it). I always use a measuring cup to make my baby's formula."
2,LEAKS,"I was prepping bottles and put 5 liners into 5 bottles and one right after the other all 5 started leaking. Those were the only 5 but with how expensive they are I shouldn't have that issue. It also was extreemly frustrating having 5 in a row and milk spilling everywhere. I have since decided to switch bottles, because of the cost and the frustration. I used these with my oldest but I just don't want to deal with buying liners all the time for another 6+ months."
1,These leak!,"I currently use Playtex Drop-ins but will be switching to something else asap. The Drop-ins have been really easy for me while at work (I pump in to them, store 8 4oz drop-ins in a gallon ziploc in the freezer and then in theory they go right into the bottle for thawing/warming and feedings with no bottles to clean) BUT... they leak. Consistently.Caregivers have lost entire bottles because the lip pulls away from the edge of the bottle and the whole liner just falls right out. They have also has issues with the liners tearing. Apparently the plastic gets warped, weak and brittle after being frozen and thawed.Do not waste your money or your milk!"
4,Great but with setbacks,"These liners are a great idea in theory. I only use them because my baby like the latex nipples and not many other bottle brands have latex nipples anymore. The measurements are a nightmare, I have to guess how much breastmilk I am pouring in the bottle. The only thing that helps is that I pour it in from a lansinoh storage bag and that gives me a better idea of how much I am putting in.With regards to leaks and the liner lip pulling free and falling out, I only experienced that with the 4oz liners but that was because I was overfilling them. However I am always worried about this happening so I screw the nipple on very carefully. It would be great if the nipple ring was clear so you could see if the liner is on the verge of pulling free or not."
2,Pretty good but has weird odor,"Very happy overall, seems to help my daughter. Except that the liners have weird, ""plasticky"", smell - each and every batch I buy. I couldn't get a reasonable explanation why the smell and this is unacceptable. Have seen the odor issue mentioned here and there when I googled for it. Will try the 8oz liner and if that smells too I'm all over with Playtex. If it wasn't for the smell I'd give 4 stars."
2,Drop-ins leaking,"The item arrived on a small box, neatly arranged along with other items, however when me and my wife used the drop-ins liners we noticed some pinhole like holes when we filled the drop-ins liners with water. Out of the first 20 7 have holes in it. We are pretty disappointed with these. :("
5,Great Product and Great Packaging,GREAT would be the word for this purchase! Too bad I could only purchase online from overseas as it is very hard to find this item in where I reside.
1,waste of money,these leak and don't colapse use the older rolled liners they do not leak. and you can see them colapse like they should
5,Love love love this system!,"I love these bottles! I breastfeed and my son takes these bottles so easily when I'm not around. They are easy and convenient! I'm not sure how they would do with mixing of formula, but it seems it may not be so easy because seeing exact measurements are rather difficult.I recommend these to everyone! No problems with excess gas and you know you are getting a fresh, clean liner everytime! Love love love them!"
5,baby product,"I was pleased with the product, however I made two purchases and the shipping charges were not combined though the items came from the same web site."
4,Convenient doesn't quite colapse like it should,"I have been using those for months and will keep using them. They are convenient because it is easy to prep a per-sterilized bottle without having to worry about cleaning bottles. I usually rotate with 4 nipples so I always have at least one clean to put on the bottle and it is ready.The bags don't seem to collapse as the milk is drunk. This might be more an issue with the bottle itself than the drop-in.First few times I wasn't careful in positioning the drop in and ending up pouring the most of the milk on baby due to a bad leak. After doing that twice I was more careful in positioning the drop-in.Conclusion it is a great idea, time saver on cleaning."
4,Bags for Playtex Baby Bottles,These are bottle bags used with Playtex bottles for feeding a baby. These bags are excellent and do the job well. I enjoy shopping on Amazon its the best way to shop!
5,"Work great, haven't had any problems","These work great for the playtex bottles. I have had no issues of them leaking, as long as they are put on properly. The number on the drop ins don't exactly match up with the numbers on the bottle."
5,Love The Playtex Drop-In System,"I have tried First Year BreastFlow bottles - (which were great for preventing nipple confusion the first month of life), Avent bottles, Madela bottles, and Playtex Drop-ins...My family's favorite are the Playtex Drop-Ins system. Because the milk is in a collapsible container, you never have to worry about air getting into your baby's system. By far, my baby had the fewest gas/colic problems with the dropins and the milk was the easiest to suck out as well.I have recommended these bottles to anyone who has cared to ask my suggestion."
3,Convinient but ...,"After trying this product for one day, I realize that the baby definitely likes it more than the other ones. It's not much about the liners themselves but rather the shape of the nipple that came with the original box. Not having to wash the liners is great but I am going to stop using this because it's disposable. I would rather handwash the bottle than resorting to the convenience of the liners. Imagine all the plastic liners that you will have accumulated by the time your baby is 2!!! It's a waste."
3,"love them, agree need measuring cup","I love these, however the measurements are inaccurate. Make sure you measure the water for the formula separate. Other than that I love the convenience!"
5,Marriage Made in Heaven or Too Tired for an Affair,"I have always enjoyed Erma Bombeck when she had a column, but the children were small and I never had much time to read. Had I gotten a book like this one, I could of breezed through raising children and marriage with much less guilt. It is one of the funniest (because it's so true) books I've ever read. I am now a collector of Erma Bombecks books. Chapters titled,; ""How Much Happiness Can We Finance?"" The book for me was filled with memories from the 50's and 60's, and how it used to be. I found myself laughing outloud and shaking my head at the humor, yet truthfulness, that Erma shares with her readers. I'm getting two more of her books for Christmas, and am getting several others on auction. If you need a laugh, kick out some of those endorphins that need to come out and lighten you up, don't miss Erma Bombeck's, ""Marriage Made in Heaven or too Tired for an Affair."" It's fantastic!"
4,"Ah, nostalgia- for those poor souls of the","""silent generation"", between the ""greatest"" & the ""boomers"".They can relive raising kids, borrowing from your in-laws, sex 50's style, dealing with the 60's etc., all with the wit & wisdom of Erma Bombeck.This is more like a memoir, probably the last in a series, that rings true sometimes, of course, with exaggeration to humorous effect.Not much to complain about here. She is a good writer who started small had an understanding, supportive husband & achieved national celebrity.If you are of a certain age, you will laugh."
2,Yummy but overpriced!,"Omaha Steaks shipped these quickly and the product was well packaged. It cooked up well in the microwave when following the directions. Broccoli & cauliflower was absolutely yummy and delicious, but I was left wanting more. The serving size is ridiculously small considering the hefty price....and I even got it on sale. The sale price is WAY too high for the two tiny servings."
3,Still Good,"I liked this product better when it was all in one package, but it is still good (tasty) even though it is split into two smaller portions."
2,I hate them all,"The writing style of this book is wonderful. Stone certainly has an excellent command of the language. The writing in this book was all, however, which I did actually enjoy. I don't believe that Stone wrote the book as well as he could have. The plot would have been good had Stone not made every character a figure of my hatred. I hate them all. None of them have any moral values. They all live according to themselves. It embarasses me to think that our country actually went through this selfish stage. ""She set about separating another high from the dope on the sheet of paper."" Drug crazed hippies. This book is about evil, selfish people focused on drugs. I did not like this book because of the lack of moral values that the characters have."
1,Unable to Understand,"I found this book very hard to understand. There are a lot of characters most of which are in one scene and didn't have much significence to the story. Throughout the book I only understood about five sections. The author used words about drugs that I couldn't understand, I didn't know what a ""fever"" was or ""getting off."" Many of these words I have never heard before. Each scene of the book was short and insignificant. The author bounced from scene to scene making it difficult to use information from one, very short, scene to the next. In the end of the book you realize there are only three important people and all the rest were fill in's to add to your confusion. I had to read this book for a school project and found it boring and frustrating. It is hard to have to read a book you don't understand."
2,Review from City High School Student,"The book Dog Soldiers has a good story line, but the writer makes it kind of hard to understand the story. I like the idea of the book, but I don't think it is written very well. The business about overseas drug dealing is very realistic. It seems that lots of drug dealers get their drugs someplace where it is cheap, and bring it back to the United States, and sell it for big bucks. The main characters are Ray Hicks, John Converse, and Marge Converse. Ray Hicks and John Converse are in Vietnam at the beginning of the story. John and Marge are married, and Marge works at a strip club, and John is a reporter in Vietnam. John Converse, and Ray Hicks are drug dealers. The story gets hard to follow when the characters are running around all over, because the writer doesn't explain who everybody is, and what they are doing with them. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good book."
5,A great American novel,"I first read ""Dog Soldiers"" when I was a teenager and was deeply impressed by it. But judging from the reviews here this is a book that you will either love or hate with no in between. So be it. Stone is probably out of reach of most mainstream readers. The only bad thing I have to say about Stone is that he sold the film rights of ""Dog Soldiers"" to the wrong people. It was made into a very terrible movie called ""Who'll Stop the Rain"" starring the highly overrated Nick Nolte."
5,blood brothers,"Odd that no one immidiately connects the dots here to Jim Thompson. The era is a shift from Thompson's stark-dark pre-60s scene but the brutal pulse, beastly characters and buyway wandering all speak to a killer story well worth wandering. There are some absolutely stupid reviews going on here from school kids and wadheads. do yourself a favor. Read this five star quick and get Stoned."
5,"Vietnam, the 60s and heroin. What could be better?","This may not be considered a ""Vietnam Novel,"" but the story begins there and the in-country scenes are as well written as any in the genre. What develops is one of the most thrilling chase stories in crime fiction. Stone is a great writer and the story flows as smoothly as the Sai Gon River. The denizens of his making in the drug trade stateside are as bad as I can imagine and real. Another innocent who doesn't have a clue about what he is getting into and pays the price. A terrific read and worthy of the accolades.Ron Lealos author of Don't Mean Nuthin'"
5,Great Chase!,"I remember this book with great fondness. Great characters and a break-neck plot. Good for escape, but also has a message from a terrific writer."
4,Keeps your attention,I would just like to say I had never heard of the author or the book until this year. As part of our contemporary Literature course this was the first book which was allocated that we read first. It is part of American Studies at University of Canterbury in New Zealand.I really enjoyed Stones style of writing even though it is abit depressing. Overall the book was captivating and showing students like myself some of the realities and aftermath during this time.
4,Typical of the era with a little extra...,"Interesting story line reaching from Vietnam to California and around some strange thinking people. Everyone is after a little rice bowl and piece of the pie, but they are too messed up to run with the big dogs so to speak. It all gets mixed up and kind of crazy, which is how I remember those times myself. Good read, tho."
2,This won the national book award?,"I may be completely missing the point of this novel, but I found it to be completely devoid of any coherent observations of any culture or ""counter-culture"" or, for that matter, anything beyond the method the protagonists used to get high on each different page. I might have been able to give this book a higher rating, despite its lack of commentary, social or otherwise, were it not for the fact that plot dragged along slowly, causing me to wonder if it would ever end... Perhaps this novel would have been better off at the novella length, perhaps not. I have the utmost repsect for Robert Stone and have, in fact, thoroughly enjoyed A Hall of Mirrors and Children of Light, but I seem truly to have missed the point of Dog Soldier"
3,Bizarre book!,"Drugs and corruption are the themes of this novel by Robert Stone. In a disjointed way, Stone shares his feelings during the time of the Vietnam War. He tells a story of a journalist, a strung out wife, and a dealer. There is not a single person in this book who is ""normal"" -all of the characters are addicted to drugs. The writing is so real and descriptive that I felt like I really was living with Converse, Marge and Hicks. The bad part was that their lives were so out of it! There is a great deal of profanity in this book, which sometimes gets in the way. The book is very complicated because there are so many characters and each character is different. If you can keep the characters straight, this is a good book."
2,I threw it against the wall,"A plodding plotline, unsympathetic characters, and a frustrating inattention to relevant details. This book doesn't move. I was bored, bored, bored. I didn't care a bit about the characters, because Stone gives me no reason to. I was eager to start this book. How disappointing. Threw it against the wall."
3,my review,"While reading Dog Soldiers by Robert Stone,I could not stand it. Iwas shocked by what I was reading. Now that I have finished the book and have thought about it,I feel that Robert Stone meant to shock people with a story filled with corrupted characters to show hoe life in the counter culture of the 1970's was. The characters are so realalistic it makes the reader almost sick to hear their story. Another feature of this novel that I feel makes it good is after you get into it you don't want to put it down. Once again I think this is because the reader has been shocked and like the characters in the novel, they are waiting for their next fix."
4,Great movie with little extras,"If you expect the same extensive extras as released on the Collector's Edition LaserDisc by Lumivision, you'll be disappointed. Unfortunately, special features like behind-the-scenes photos, production material, original sketches or isolated music & effects track are missing. Only the commentary track, the special effects footage and the original theatrical trailer are included. But in return you get for the first time a Dolby Digital 5.1 version of this originally mono recorded cult classic."
4,Wha...,"entertaining but my question is. why did this get four stars and starship troopers 2 has been bashed at every street corner, they are the same filmk different story and universe. that being said its an entertaing flick of paranoia and fear of everyone around you not because of who they are but whats inside them. people say its not an original film but list time i checked they arent and other movies with alien space-slugs using people as hosts. body snatchers actually replaced them with alien copies. in this they are the same people just infected."
4,A campy classic,"An underrated near classic, The Hidden is a B-movie that strives to be better than it should be, and it nearly succeeds on every level. Kyle MacLachlan stars as an otherworldly cop after a criminal alien lifeform that can jump from one person to another and has a taste for fast cars and heavy metal music. Michael Nouri stars as MacLachlan's human partner, and they work great together. While The Hidden is surprisingly well done, there are a few gripes; first off you can tell this movie was made in the 80's, and the relationship between MacLachlan and Nouri's daughter is never explained, not even in its straight to video sequel released a few years back (which was godawful), and the flamethrower is obviously foreshadowed in the beginning of the movie. All that aside, The Hidden is a surprisingly good sci-fi flick that fans of the Terminator series or the Aliens will enjoy."
4,Never seen anything like it.,"The Hidden is a great movie to watch around 11:30 PM on a Friday night with a big bowl of popcorn and soft drink. It has the feel of a low budget movie, but surprises you with its graphic effects. The effects and movie plot manage to maintain one's interest throughout the entire movie.Although some parts may be a little gross, it falls in line with movies made during the '80s.I would definitely recommend this movie."
5,Great Ride!,"Good story, great acting, great special effects, and lots of action! I wanted this in my collection."
4,The Hidden: A Sci-Fi classic.,"I saw this movie years ago, and had to have the DVD. The alien bad guy is hilarious."
1,Awful.,"The Hidden is boring sci-fi action. It's basically a cliched and derivative plot that features lame shootouts, excruciatingly bad dialogue, inept direction, and lame acting. Stick with The Terminator or Invasion of the Body Snatchers."
3,Non stop action and fun to watch!,"If you like bad guys that don't care about anyone and is smart and devious this movie is for you! It should be a classic for its unique script and is written well for this kind of movie. The alien can take over any animal, but doesn't know about them/us until he is part of them. I thought about giving it 4 stars, but it has a few technical flaws that bugged me. Have fun!"
4,hidden giant snail like alien,"""jame?!"" , its kyle machaklan-whatever the spelling rt. now--from dune in his equal best showing in film in another great movie. what a very cool orig. movie here from the involvers of elmstreet fame. bad thing-some fx flaws and other lil flaws in the movie and at the end is mike nouri now kyle the alien? that i can remember for now. this is an interntl cult fav, underground, w/ some dark comedy mixed emotion, very stylish type film and from 1987 with very cool and orig. sound fx. No, kyle here is not data"" from star trek nxt generation. famous remembered quote from this film ""i want the car, i need the keys, thank you, bye, pow"" that certain human takeover was the funniest, my bro in law laughed. see ya, c."
5,Incredibly Entertaining!,"This movie is a hidden gem and enormously entertaining.It's a fast- paced account of normal people taking turns being inhabited by an alien being and suddenly turning into out-of-control killing machines. It guess it kind of sounds dumb, but seeing it is better than describing it. The characters in here are wild.Kyle MacLachlan plays his normal mid-80s strange character, a la ""Blue Velvet,"" ""Twin Peaks,"" etc. Here, he is the FBI agent....or is he?On the first viewing I found Michael Nouri's role as too abrasive, taking away from some of the fun of viewing this, but, in future viewings he was more tolerable. What also helps this film is a little bit of humor thrown in here and there.It will probably wind up as a cult classic."
3,good service,The product was out of stock but you did your best to send it to me as soon as possible. I appreciate this kind of service.
4,Good memory at a good price.,I purchased this memory to upgrade a 1yo MacBook. I had no problems after installing the memory. Crucial makes a good product and I would buy their prodcut again. Amazon had a better price than [...] and I would look here for my next upgrade.
5,mac mini,"This works great in my 2007 Intel Core 2 Duo 1.83GHZ mac mini. If you're shopping for ram for this computer, make sure you get some that's DDR-2, 667 MHZ, and 200-pin."
5,"Worked Perfect for MacBook 2,1 (13"" Late 2006)","I was very hesitant, because of reading all the mixed reviews of memory either not working, causing fan issues, etc, but I am happy to report this was a completely perfect, cheap solution for this old MacBook. I did not have any issues whatsoever. With the extra memory, I was able to upgrade to OSX Lion (from Snow Leopard) and it runs soooooo much better than it did with 1GB. As some have mentioned, only 3.2GB is actually usable by the OS, even though all 4GB is reporting in ""About This Mac"". This is not an issue with the memory but a limitation of this MacBook. It's still the best/cheapest option to upgrade to the maximum memory possible. It definitely breathed new life into this old guy, that and a bigger faster HDD."
5,What I needed,This was a great purchase. My inlaws wanted to spend (didn't WANT to) 800 on a new laptop that wasn't that old. They h ad 2gb installed and could go up to 4. Short version is they LOVE it..and at about 45 bucks this was a no brainer to get them a couple more years on their computer. And of course all the son in law points!!
5,Works wonders!,This memory upgrade made my 2007 Mac run smoother! Doubled the RAM and Macs need a lot of it. Computer recognized the additional RAM quickly. I would recommend this upgrade.
5,Works great!,I have an Acer Aspire 5610-4648 loaded with Vista Home Premium (32 bits).Bought it used (like new) a few months ago. Works great. Simply said.Upgraded from 2GB to 4GB RAM. I see good improvement in speed in general.
2,Did not help that much,"I got this 4gb crucial memory ram for my early 2011 macbook pro and it did nothing. My pro originally had 3gb ram (2x1.5gb)and 320gb hard drive. I use final cut pro, Google chrome, and a ton of video editing things for movies and clips i enjoy making. I also usually have a ton of tabs open. When I installed the 2x2gb ram from crucial i saw a slight difference. My friends with the same model macbook pro bought a 2x2gb ram from another brand and his macbook pro is much faster than mine."
5,"Not much to say, it did its job!","It arrived quickly in the mail and after a simple installation, by my techy bf, my computer (2007 macbook) is now much faster!"
5,Working well,"I had a computer with only 1GB on it, and it was s o o o o o o slow! With these chips added, it now moves at a more satisfactory rate."
5,Perfect memory and Great price!,Crucial CT2KIT25664AC667 200-Pin SODIMM DDR2 PC2-5300 CL=5 Unbuffered NON-ECC DDR2-667 1.8V 256Meg x 64 2GBx2 4GB KitI purchased Crucial DDR2 PC2-5300 2GBX2 4GB Kit and it worked like a charm. I installed it and I didn't have to do anything else. It was the correct ram and it's working great. The price was terrific! I highly recommend this product and Crucial's guidance on choosing the correct modules for my computer.tm
1,My fan won't stop after install ... 2007 Mac Mini,"I have a 2007 Mac Mini Core Duo 2GHz for reference. After installing this memory my fan kicked on and never turned off. The memory appears to be working, but as another reviewer stated they must be missing a temperature sensor that affects fan function. This small issue turns my normally quiet mini into a train coming down the tracks. I would definitely suggest researching this memory for your specific machine before you click the purchase button. It may save you the headache of dis-assembly, assembly, dis-assembly, assembly, return, purchase different memory and then dis-assembly, assembly again scenario I now face."
2,not impressed !,Before I bought this paired 4gig combo pack (2gx2g=4gb)for use in my Toshiba Tecra A8 I had been using a 1gig stick and a 500k stick for a total memory of 1.5gb (unmatched/paired. I was so happy when they came! The shipping was ouber fast came in like 2 days. I have had the new memory instald now for about 2 weeks and to be honest I think my computer might actually be running slower??? I had better performance when I had my old memory installed! Not sue why? my comp says that I have 4g installed but it sure hasn't made a hill of beans difference like I thought it would!
5,Speed,I believe speed laptop is more faster.This laptop i do not use very often.Do not have enough information now.
5,Runs great for Apple MacBook (Late-2007) with Snow Leopard!,I prefer this over Kingston any day. I had a Kingston that died on me when I had a 2007 Mac mini. I seen that Crucial uses Micron so I was pretty much sold since Apple uses Micron as one of the OEM memory suppliers. If you want reliability get the Crucial Memory it's priced a lot cheaper than going to Apple and ironically Apple uses the same company Crucial uses for it's OEM Memory.
5,"Perfect in a 15"" MacBook Pro","Purchased this memory to replace the OEM memory in my 15"" MacBook Pro (2.2ghz Core 2 Duo) and max it out at 4gb. Works perfectly, no compatibility issues in over 3 weeks of use. Much better deal than the ridiculous price wanted by Apple or so-called Apple ""expert"" resellers."
3,Did not work.,"Memory errors after one week in use. Patriot was very good supporting its warranty, but the cost of shipping to exchange inexpensive memory almost makes it throwaway. Came with bare bones kit. Did not work."
5,Easy upgrade,Works perfectly in my dell latitude d820 notebook. Easy upgrade from 1GB and no problems whatsoever so far.
3,Description of Book - Taken From Publisher's Web Site,"There is an unseen, spiritual brotherhood operating among us. They have been in existence on this planet for well over 400,000 years, offering guidance and service to those who ask.The call themselves the Brotherhood of Intuition.They serve in a very active manner at this time because of the great transformation all people on this planet are making as we progress towards the next century. Awareness is being dramatically increased as the Christ Consciousness even now permeates all realms in its inevitable manifestation, enabling those from all countries and religious stances to quicken their intuition in a meaningful way.It is the express purpose of this small booklet to introduce you to the Brotherhood. Furthermore, it is felt that by doing so you may learn how to contact them yourself as your own intuitive senses are redeveloped."
3,Jesse Jackson,I wanted to read the book to find out more about the life of Reverend Jesse Jackson. Information about his chlldhood was the most enlightening element. I am glad I read it. Basic biography - no shockers.
3,Worth the read - but take with a grain of salt,"A lot of the information presented in this book is outdated. Current research is not included. Also, be ware that it has an alarmist feel to it and may not be completely objective in its stance."
2,General and shallow overview,"This book is bad for beginner and practically useless for a master. There is no comprehensive description of training complexes, footwork drills and other important details, which were completely omitted. It gives just an overview of the system in general, so the reader can have some vague feeling of what Giron escrima is."
2,Not what I expected,"I was hoping for a better famous quotes kind of book. This book is loaded with quotes by people I never heard of. I make pretty good quotes sometimes, I could be in it. Well put together, just not what I had hoped for."
3,Wish it were larger,"I liked the quotes, but wished there were more. Someone out there, please put together a large book of quotes."
5,In love w/my home girl tank,What can I say? Gwen's got the illest taste and it shows in all things Harajuku.
4,Decent quality unit,"I bought this headset to wear while putting in time mowing the lawn. The noise reduction is good. The radio is quite directional which makes it less than ideal in use, but I bought it to use the audio input function from my smartphone and I can listen to podcasts or music. I think they should throw in at least one audio cable, or dispense with the special plug requirement that this headset uses. The dual pin audio plug is in no way superior to a regular mini jack, and still requires some tweaking, bending of pins, etc, to make good contact.I've also used the headset at work and the 'surround aware' facility of this headset is cool."
3,"am reception very poor, sound excellent","The sound reduction system with a dial to allow conversation but still stop the noise is excellent. Highly recommended. However, the AM station I listen to, which has an antenna close to me, and reaches 90 miles to the West and about 35 miles to the East, is very in and out. On a lawn mower it is horrible as every time you turn, the sound level goes up or even totally silent. You wind up cocking your head for best reception as you mow. Not sure why the am reception is so poor. I have other radio that I use to garden and it maintains volume no matter which way I face. I have not tried the FM as I don't listen to it."
4,I like them,"I bought these to listen the radio ( music and football games) when I am mowing the lawn or working in the yard. I had an old pair of AM/FM headphones from Radio Shack that have great sound but are falling apart. I looked long and hard before buying these. I came to the conclusion that these were the best headphones on the market for my purposes for a reasonable price. After using the for some time, I can honestly say they are good but they could be better. They are well made and they have good sound. The ambient sound mic is a nice addition too. My big complaints are that they are too tight, the ear cushions could be softer, and the dial tuner is very narrow in its reception range. You have to pin point the station you want by moving back and forth until you are right on the frequency. A digital tuner would be better. That said, they work and I am happy with them."
5,I wished i had bought them years ago,I work in a noisy factory envirement and these headfones block out the noise beautifully and i can listen to my radio station and not my workmates next bench over. There great
3,Problem with headset,"The unit worked as advertised EXCEPT the AM radio is sensitive to direction. When I turn my head to a certain direction, while listening to the radio, the station fades. This is very annoying while working in my shop or mowing the lawn. This happens only with the AM radio not the FM radio.I talked to an engineer at peltor and they are aware of this problem,but they do not seem to be planing to do anything about it."
3,Pretty good headset,"I got these hoping for the best of all worlds. I'm usually the cut guy, so I need to hear what's being shouted at me, but its a pain to take off a headset between cuts...That said, the quality of what you hear from the outside mic is ok at best. You can hear what other people say, but there is a sort of low background static.Also the radio jack is not for your typical mp3 player, it is for a 2way radio, I think. Anyway, I thought it would accept my player, but needed to buy a $30 adapter cable to connect. Boo. My mis understanding, but they could have mentioned the jack type. you also can't change the volume of the input from the radio on the headset(only on the player, again probably not what these were designed for).The radio works well, and also the sound reduction.The Skinny-Hearing protection,and radio = greatOutside mics = okconnect to mp3 player = poor"
2,Peltor AM/FM radio headset,I have a severe problem with both AM and FM stations fading out. The dial also drifts. The set is comfortable and does an excellent job of blocking out unwanted noises.
5,Works Great,"This headset works just great. It is comfortable to ware. It blocks the noise of my T190 Bobcat just fine. The radio is nice. If I had to complain it would be the cost of adapter that plugs into my MP3 player, $24. And it was hard to find. But sound quality is good."
2,Bad choice !,"If you are looking for am AM/FM headset to take to the race track or to use with your scanner DO NOT BUY THIS HEADSET !( Besides having to buy a special 30 dollar connecting cord) This product will not work with a power spliter.The ""drift"" on the Feq. dial is horrible. (if you can even find the station )!& the dial has NO numbers so the AM/FM STATIONS ARE TO FIND. For 100 dollars you get 50 dollar quality."
4,I wish I could wear them all the time!,"Just what I wanted. Station tuning knob could be much better. Stations very hard to find and keep dialed in. Outside sounds in thru the microphones is just great and sound proofing of outside noise perfect. A great product, considering I could not find anything better. I would have paid up to $300.00 for better. Doesn't exist though. For what it is intended to do it is very adequate and reasonably priced.I have used the headphones for over a year now. The only complaint I have is the tuner. The stations don't stay tuned in and are very hard to adjust. This needs to be digital for the money. I am now not so happy with this product."
4,Great features,"This product delivers as stated. Sound attenuation is excellent. Ability to adjust volume to hear important/normal sounds is great. Comfortable for short term use. Only negatives: 1. hot if worn for over 30-45"" at a time. 2. tuner on radio is very sensitive, digital tuner would be nice."
2,radio sucks,"Headphone is great for hearing protection, but the radio reception and tuning is terrible. I'm very disappointed with this product. I intended to use it while cutting grass but it is difficult with the radio stations reception constantly fading in and out. Not worth the price, that's for sure."
3,fabulous ear protection but can you find the station you want?,"The sound attenuation on this unit is great, much better than the ones it replaced. Also, they are pretty comfortable, though like any over the ear muff type item, they can be a bit hot. Also, the sound quality on the radio is pretty good as is the ability of the unit to pick up someone talking to me as they walk into my shop while running power equipment, even with a 3hp dust collector running in addition to the machine I'm using. Helps to not be startled. All of the above deserve four or five stars. However, the fact that the radio doesn't have any presets nor does it provide any indication of where you are on the radio dial qualify for one star. A major annoyance and that deserves one star. So overall, I give it three stars."
2,Worked for a bit,"Ordered after my contractor swears by them. Had the headsets for 4 months and the radio has stopped working, of course just after it becomes non-returnable. They were great for as long as they worked, just not very reliable. Also, the radio dial does not show what channel you are on, so its just turn and guess."
4,Peltor Radio Headset,"I have had the original Peltor Work Tunes for several years, but FM reception was lousy. These have much better reception and are not affected so much by the direction I am facing. Although I would have liked digital tuning, this headset holds the station much better - the last headset had to be retuned each time I turned it on."
3,A little short of expectations,"The noise cancelling feature works well. I bought the Alert so I could listen to stuff from my i-pod while at work. This works good, but in order to use your MP3 player at all you have to purchase an accessorie cord which is completely proprietary to this headset, (and also made by Peltor), at the cost of 30.00 + shipping. Given the cost of the headset itself you would expect the cord to be supplied with the unit. The FM radio works OK if you have a good strong signal, but the AM cannot seem to pick up even the strongest signal which is annoying to me as I like listening to talk radio. If I had to buy another set , I would dig around a little harder for another brand"
1,Be aware of european model #,"BEWARE OF MODEL NUMBER, Ordered 2 of the headsets they work as advertised, EXCEPT I was sent the following model # M2RX7A-77 which is the EUROPEAN version, the FL6N cable DOES NOT WORK with this model number, I contacted Peltor America and they said the FL6N cable will not work with the EUROPEAN model ""M2RX7A-77"" I am returing the product becuase of this. Purchased from Altatac through Amazon, spoke to Altatec on the phone and they had no idea what I was talking about, just said that is what they recieved from Peltor."
5,Peltor M2RX7A,"My husband uses heavy equipment for farming(60's era farm CAT). Loud noise all day long. With these headphones he was able to listen to a variety of radio stations while almost completely blocking out the engine noise and was able to hear subtle changes as conditions changed. They fit well, snug, and he is ready to take them off at the end of the day, but they are comfortable. The batteries are lasting well and are easy to change. The surround sound (lets you hear soft sounds like a voice with the noise blocking on) works well. I have another friend who has used this headset and said it blocked out the sound of hammer blows while he was able to talk to a co-worker. Cool! I like these better than any other radio headset I have purchased."
2,Unpredictability and Stupidity are two different things....,"I have to agree with the first reviewer. I did not feel stupid when I couldn't predict the heroine's actions; instead, I felt that she was not as intelligent as she is supposed to be. I am a fan of spunky, unpredictable heroines--try Midnight Kisses by Kimberly Raye, High Energy by Dara Joy, almost any book by Jillian Hunter, Julie Garwood or Jill Barnett. They have heroines who are fun (and funny) without compromising their intelligence.In this book, the heroine is working on her doctoral dissertation; however, being told she is smart doesn't do it for me. Ms. Riley should SHOW that she is smart, and frankly, her actions (and reactions) are as dumb as they get.Yes, this book is funny and sexy, two things that I appreciate in books that I read for pleasure. However, if you want a heroine that shows at least SOME sign of intelligence, try something else."
2,Outside pots,"Do not imagine that this book is about growing herbs inside in a window garden. The chapters are almost exclusively about pots outside. Even the chapter on the indoors is about propagation. The subjects of topiary, kitchen herbs, and some basics on planting and dry land herbs are included.There is a section on making hypertufa containers, but no diagrams are given and we only see the finished containers from above - and then only the top edge. Most pictures are taken from above, so it is hard to see the containers. Pests and diseases are covered in a short section, but there are not pictures or diagrams to help you with these either. For some herbs they tell you what the herb is but not how to grow it.More practical information is needed. There are lots of pictures, but in many pictures the herbs are not identified. It's a nice little book to look at and give you ideas on arranging your container grown herbs or other plants, but an instruction-helpful resource, it is not."
5,Just have to have it...,These guys are random (in a good way) and give a great read. A plethora of information & Beautiful pictures inspires Lots of ideas!
5,Awesome Taste,"The taste is amazing. The powder actually has black tea leaves listed as an ingredient. No blender needed. Just use a ""Blender Bottle"", the powder mixes easily and foams a little too. I highly suggest you try it if you're tired of the typical flavors of whey protein."
3,Fuzzy Dice,"I LOVE my new dice! (Because I am a D.C. Fan for LIFE)....The only thing that caught my eye was.... the fact that the Blue Dice was kind of mis-shapen. (meaning: it was not completely in the shape of a square. Kind of rounded on the end and you could see where the thread was sewn in on the dice.)Other than that, I LOVE Amazon.......I ALWAYS recomend you to my friends and family. :-)"
4,fans,well i bought this to complete my husbands collection. He really said it was kiddish . But my son loved it for his room .
3,Wrong sign,"This is the plaque I ordered, but not the one I received. What I got was nice, but still disappointed since I was sent something different than I ordered and can't seem to get a response out of anyone about it."
4,farrar shows well live,Just some excellent live performances of jays work. amust if you love americanna or roots rock.
2,Please someone tell me where else I can find this song,"I have heard this whole CD and it's nothing special. One song is very good and I do wish to have it. It is the first song, ""Things don't have to be this way"". I do want that song but don't want to have to pay for this very ordinary CD to get it. I have not been able to find where else it is so if someone knows I would sure appreciate you pointing me towards it. Thanks."
1,Newsflash - Farrar Loses Plot,"Guess what folks - another solo disappointment from the most boring man in alt.country. Jay Farrar has completely lost it - every damn song on this record is boring, save for Cahokian, which is merely trite and re-hashed. Do not waste your money on this garbage unless you love the rest of his solo work, in which case you should have a lobotomy. Listen, dear consumer, buy the Uncle Tupelo best of and then Buy Son Volt's TRACE and Wilco's YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT. Then forget about Jay Farrar.P.S. He is even more boring as a solo live act than on record."
5,Zen at it's best.,"Chinul, could very well be considered a Bodhisattva at least. Anyone interested in Korean Zen, or Zen as a whole, would do well to purchase this book."
2,Boring,"This was sooooooooooooooooo boring. First off, it only shows 1 book signing-all you see is Michael sitting in a music store in N.Y. for over an hour signing and signing and its soooooooooooo boring. You can tell he's not into it. And it's November of 2001 so 9/11 just happened. When the camera pans outside to fans, you can see the busted out windows of nearby buildings. I didn't like this DVD and wish I hadn't have ordered it. I would have much rather have seen Michael Jackson on tour somewhere other than what he was doing in N.Y. Not a good timing for him."
4,For the Less Handy Handyman,"I gave this review the title ""For the Less Handy Handyman"" because the ""real"" masons in the work group looked upon this trowel with some disdain... you know, the pros can ""magically"" do all the tricky stuff with the same finishing trowel. For us less experienced stucco volunteers, it was handy for inside corner work and it gave enough wall coverage to make ""invisible"" transitions. So, if you aren't an expert, you might like one of these, too."
5,Jukebox Gems 1967,"I bought this cd mainly for song by The Left Banke Pretty Ballerina,but there is alot of other good old songs on this cd and the sound of this cd is good. In the Track Listing it list the correct songs,but who ever listed the artist next to the song listed the wrong artist. These songs on this cd are by the original artist. This cd is another gem in my collection."
3,VERY RICH - NEEDS IMPROVEMENT,"I love stuffing and dressing & Zatarain's products but this mix falls short. It calls for one half stick of butter and the cooked product is really oily. Butter is all you can taste. Perhaps more cornbread would help? Also the product is bland. I hope to see a ""New & Improved"" package of Zatarain's Cornbread Stuffing Mix on the supermarket shelves soon! There rice mixes are wonderful."
1,Doesn't work,'Universal' it is not - failed to link up to any and all electronics we tried it with. Don't waste your money.
5,"Great price, works as described...only one small complaint","Cheap, works, retains the programming codes so you don't have to re-enter them a lot.Only thing I don't like is the shift button. You have to use it for several things when controlling the DVD player, and it doesn't have a light up button or anything, so you never know if ""shift"" is currently selected or not. This matters when you press a button and it performs its alternate function rather than the one you intended. A light-up button indicating ""shift"" is activated would have been great.Other than that, it all works. It's nice to have a remote that DOESN'T have 300 buttons. This one is simple enough to use...I control an ancient Sharp VCR, a Sony flatscreen TV, and a new Philips DVD player without any problems. Codes were simple and all worked fine. Best couple of bucks you can spend!I would give it a 4 if it cost $30, but because of the incredible bargain and only a small complaint, I have to give this product 5 stars."
1,Not Quite Universal,"The package says guarantee to work on all devices... BUT None of the code works for the Toshiba TV I have, its not even one of those exotic brands! contacted the tech support and they said I will have to buy a more expensive remote from their company and MAYBE that will work. Think twice before you buy people!"
3,not upgradeable remote,I got this remote about a month ago only to find out that it does not work with my Insignia DTV tuner. I contacted the company and they said that I need to purchase an upgradeable remote to make it work because this particular model does not have the code for my DTV tuner.
4,One for all Universal big button remote,I bought it for a TV we have ine the office and it works great. Very easy to set up. We are pleased with it.
3,batteries,"Occasionally doesn't work. If I spin the batteries or pop them out and put them back in the Remote will work again.Otherwise, we really like it. Easy to use and program."
1,Disappointed,"I had previously purchased one of these and had no problems. This transaction I bought 4 and not one of them works correctly, ie: the DVD button operates the VCR; I can't change the channel down only up; the book gives a code for a 3 device unit but no instructions for how to program it. I e-mailed them over a week ago and no one has e-mailed me back. Finally for the review I couldn't send this without putting at least one star. I didn't want to put any stars. Why can't I not give it any if it doesn't deserve any?"
1,instructions missing,"I couldn't get this to work on my parents TV/VCR/DVD combo although the code was there. However, even if I had, there are NO instructions on how to USE the device, ie: record with the VCR, or play the DVD. People might say that remote controllers area all the same, and I probably could have figured it out, but for my 80 year old+ parents it would have been useless.I would have rated it zero if I'd had the choice."
2,Very Disappointing,"After such high hopes, I have been nothing but disappointed in this product. At first I could not get it to work with my small Sylvania TV. I tried not only the five codes given in the book, but all of the codes. I could, however, set up the SONY VCR connected to the TV. After sending an email to the company,I received instructions (pretty much the same as the book) to set the remote up. After numerous tries, it worked. However, the remote only works occasionally for the TV, some days off and some days on. It works all the time for the VCR. At least, it was not expensive, but I hate the thought of having to purchase another one and going through the same process again."
5,Awesome remote control. I definitely recommend.,"I highly recommend this remote control to anyone who is looking for a simple remote at a very inexpensive price. I used this remote to program my TV, VCR and DVD player and had it operating all three devices within 5 to 10 minutes of taking it out of its packaging. The only feature I would like, which is doesn't have, is glow-in-the-dark buttons but for this price I cannot complain. I am very happy with this product and would certainly buy it again."
1,didnt ever work,I received the product very promptly from Amazon. Opened it up and put batteries in it. Nothing. It never worked. I emailed the manufacturer. No response. I am was very disappointed and will think twice about buying something like this online ever again.
4,"Works well on my 13"" Toshiba TV","The remote for my 13"" Toshiba TV started acting up recently, difficulty with some buttons while others were fine. I cracked it open and cleaned the contacts, but it didn't help. I wasn't sure this remote would work after I saw another reviewer who had problems with his Toshiba TV. There are four codes included for Toshiba televisions and mine ended up being the third. Programming is easy, you just press the device button (TV, DVD, VCR), hold SET for two seconds, then enter a four digit code.The only problem I'm having is working the menu. I can get the menu up and select items with channel +/- buttons (using SHIFT), but I can't find a key to open the selected menu item in order to manage channels or adjust the picture. It looks like I should be able to operate the menu using buttons on the TV itself, so I'll manage."
3,"Good, but not great. . .","I loved the history of the Sparrow family and the in-depth descriptions of nature really helped set the scene, but I had a hard time getting into the book overall. In fact, I started it three times before I finally read it all the way through. It is a good story, but I had a hard time caring about the characters, especially Jenny.Would I read it again? No. Would I recommend it? Maybe."
2,"Good potential, but doesn't live up","The premise for this story is one that interests me, 'gifted' women and the stories of their lives and love. Something about this story was just boring to me. It jumps around in an unpredictable way that isn't easy to folow. I just really didn't like it. Too bad, good idea."
2,Disappointed,"I loved Practical Magic and looked forward to this one, but by the time I reached the end, it was a sheer chore just to try and finish. Hoffman does a fantastic job with description but I think she focuses way too much on that front. I felt no sympathy for the characters because really, there was a serious lack of development in each and every one of them. The idea of the Sparrow women and their gifts and their history was an interesting start, but that was really the only thing good about this book. Believe me when I say I never throw books away because I always donate copies if I don't want to keep them, but with this, I tossed it BEFORE I even finished."
2,Groan,"Groan, don't authors have editors anymore? I guess Ms Hoffman is looking for a movie contract. This is a labored read and I couldn't muster up sympathy for any character, except maybe the serial stalker. If you miss a description, don't fret, it will be mentioned at least a dozen more times."
4,Good Character Driven Magical Realism,"This is a story of magical realism and 3 generations of women trying to handle the legacy of the Sparrow family and their own relationships with each other.This is my first Alice Hoffman book after hearing so much about this author. I really enjoyed this story and the character development. This is a character driven book, yes, there is the whole dad in jail story line but it is not the main story.The main story is about these generations of Sparrow women and how things that happened years ago to their ancestors can have an effect all those years later.I did enjoy this book and plan on reading more by this author!I would recommend this to anyone who likes magical realism or character driven storylines.3 Stars"
5,Will Purchase more books in the Probable Future by Hoffman!,"This book is filled with great character studies, with the sense of the time period, and has curves and spins that were not expected by this reader. An excellent read, and I was recommended to this author by another author I love who says that Hoffman is her favorite author. I understand why. Five stars!"
4,Hoffman creates illusions and spins a memorable tale,"This is my third Hoffman book - and I continue to be entertained by her imagery and the way she describes things. For example, I hope to never forget the types of rain one of her characters share.These reviews range - to those who were critical - I ask - have we who are ""reviewing"" ever written something ourselves? Do we have any idea what it takes to write?!I do think Hoffman is extremely gifted and look forward to her continued writing. The way she writes about mother - daughter relationships always sheds more light on this volatile relationship."
3,Great beach reading but thats about it.,"This book was a simple and fast read. I think its perfect for the beach or a vacation when you dont want to tackle anything too challenging. The story is about generations of women (but focuses on the most recent 3 generations) who inheret a gift on their 13th birthday (ie cant feel pain, can see how people will die, tell when someone is lying). I enjoyed the book for what it was but it didnt pull any emotion from me or make itself all that memorable to me. The book was written at a medium pace so it didnt bore me. I enjoyed the premiss of the book and the authors stories of the previous generations, but I feel like it lacked that something special to set it apart. I dont think its a waste of time to read but I also dont think you should make it your number one book to get!"
1,DON'T USE THIS VENDOR!!!!,"Can't honestly rate this item, as it was shipped to me with some sort of unidentifiable dark brown, sticky substance all over the outside of the jar and was disposed of immediately. The product might be good quality, however after reading ratings from this vendor, I wouldn't put anything edible from them in my mouth, they are downright nasty and should be investigated."
4,Very Good!,I thought this was a very cute-light hearted movie. I really enjoyed the romantic love story and it had some funny scenes as well. I just wish there was more to it. When it ended I wanted more and that bugged me a bit. Its worth owning!
2,A Subtitled Mish Mash,"I'm a person who enjoys this type of film and yet found this one to be lacking in so many ways. The story line has whole a person could fly through and the conection between the two main characters was stiff and had very little impact. Recommend instead: Fingersmith, Bound or, Better Than Chocolate as the above three will not leave you wondering or disappointed."
3,"Delightful, Believable","The romance between the two women is fairly believable -- not too far-fetched. A lot of the craziness of the males surrounding them is a bit out there, though. There seemed to be a bit of difficulty creating realistic male characters. But, again, the women's romance was decently believable."
3,A very tough read,"I read the book as part of a history class for seminary. I needed another book just to decipher what his points really are. I appreciate the subject, I wish that someone would write a newer book that is a more engaging read."
3,"Enough with the ""Neuromancer"", already...","The whole first chapter of this book is a piece of low-grade Gibsonesque cyber-punk. The only thing missing is a reference to an Ono-Sendai ""Samurai VII"" cyber-deck. (This chapter is especially amusing, since the author makes references to ""loading TSR programs."" MS-DOS ???) Why are the authors killing trees with that kind of garbage in a book on malware technology?The rest of the book is fairly informative, although it seems to be padded with a lot of supporting information about things like good vs. bad random number generators. People who have enough background to understand the threats the authors are describing probably don't need a refresher course in algorithms. People who DON'T have enough background probably won't be helped by the cursory treatment of these subjects given in the book.All that being said, this is probably worth reading if you can get it for half off retail."
3,Not that bad...,"The title baited me in. I was apprehensive because I didn't see much of a use in malware for crypto, or rather I didn't see how it could be productive. I was surprised to find it was rather useful and has added a trick or two to my malware analysis toolkit. You need to have a pretty heavy crypto understanding to make use of it though."
5,At Last! Freedom from the AC Power Cord,"Purchased a Garmin 276C through Amazon, but the battery did not hold charge very long. Should have complained but months went by. Bought the bullet and purchased a new battery. Works as intended and I have my freedom back."
5,Perfect,"Perfect fit for the GPS. They last about six hours of continuous use, so if you are riding all day long, you will need a backup. Well worth the price."
4,Battery replacement for Garmin 276c,"This battery was bought to replace my original battery, despite having purchased the Model 010-10517-00, 010-10517-02 model was delivered, which has a capacity less than that requested. Apparently it worked normally, I will try, but I'm with her for only two days. Let's see how it will behave."
4,Professional Development for high school library collection,"Sent wrong book...but, reimbursed full payment (including shipping) and was willing to locate correct title. Vendor communicated with me through email until problem was resolved."
4,Exactly What I Ordered and Delivered Fast,"Badge reels are high quality and arrived quickly. I only needed one package, so that made the cost of shipping as much as the reels themselves. Still, I am quite pleased with this seller."
3,Cheesy but watchable,"First of all, this 1980s-vintage film about an Iraqi story seems incredibly dated after all of the experiences we've had with Iraq since then. It appears as though the movie was filmed partially in Egypt or Israel and doesn't give a very convincing appearance of Iraq. Most of the actors are Americans or stock Arabic-speaking actors from the time and not necessarily Iraqis. However, in spite of these drawbacks which give the film a bit of a cheesy flavor, it is an engaging version of a true story. It's definitely an interesting 1980s-era romantic war movie. The setting is the mid 1960s just before the Six Day War and before Iraq was under the control of Saddam Hussein."
4,Very good fast film,This is a very fine film with great music. Good acting although a bit dated. Very provocative retelling of a true story of a woman spy who seduces an Arab pilot to get him to fly new technology into Israel. Very interesting piece if Israeli and middle East history. Fast paced.
5,Great movie,"It is a very entertaining movie. It is very fast paced, and you will never be bored watching it."
3,Ok movie but too long,"I usually like Asian horror movies because they tend to have more suspense and less gore than American films. Unfortunately, the guardpost came up short on suspense.The first 45 mins or so were good since the film kept you guessing as to what the real issue was - ghosts, demons, virus, or just crazy soldiers. Once you find out what is causing the deaths, the best part is over. But unfortunately, the movie isn't. At about 2 hrs, there was just too much of the same stuff at the end. I knew how the film would end before it happened, though I was surprised at what took place with a few of the characters.This movie is great if you like long, drawn out conversations and don't mind getting confused with all of the flashbacks. There is some drama and a few scenes make you gasp, but there are not enough of them to make it worth spending 2hrs on this film. Fortunately, the movie was free with my Prime membership so I wasn't too upset."
3,Need an editor,Interesting storyline but could use a better editor. The flash backs were confusing and failed to provide the desired effect.
2,i probably would have liked it,"I liked what I saw of it, but for some reason, no matter where I went, the video and audio started to unsync after the first act. I never got past Act 1."
2,Wont last too long,"I liked the smell of this perfume but it won't last too long. After about an hour, the smell is gone. It is more like a splash than a perfume."
3,No Staying Power...,"The fragrance is inviting. However, the scentbecomes faint within three to four hours. Not worth the price..."
1,TERRIBLE PURCHASE!,"This is my very first TERRIBLE experience purchasing from Amazon; I have shopped here for numerous years and had never had this issue.This is a Bvlgari Jasmin perfume; it smells like industrial alcohol. I tried it several times since it arrived yesterday, and it smells nothing like the original one. I have used the Bvlgari Jasmin for years, and now it has discontinued because the company launched Bvlgari Jasmin Noir that I don't like, hence my attempt to purchase the original Jasmin from the Internet rather than stores and Bvlgari, itself. I still have a little bit of my previous Bvlgari Jasmin perfume left, so I compared the scent and sprayed each on one wrist; the one I just purchased from Amazon smells like alcohol where my old one, though it has a few drops left, smells like how it supposed to.I will be returning this.Thank you,D.D."
5,LOVE IT!,"This is an absolute must if you like lightly scented fragrance. Bvlgari gets a ""10"" for this incredible contribution to the wonderful world of perfumes and colognes. I've been wearing this scent for years. Actually believe this is my signature scent. LOVE IT! So glad to find this on Amazon.com. Thanks so much!"
3,Great toy but not for agressive chewers,"I was looking for a toy that my Border Aussie puppy would be challenged by and that would hold his interest. This toy worked great and he loved pulling the balls out of the cube. But after a couple months, he managed to chew through the binding around the openings. After repeated mendings, I finally got rid of the cube but kept the balls - he loves playing with them and loves the squeakers inside."
5,76CS is Awesome,"If your on the road or in the boat, this is the GPS for you. Has been Great. The only thing better would be Voice Navigation in the car but it does beep when a turn is coming. Highly recommend the device. The magnetic compass keeps you pointed in the right direction even when at idle."
2,GPS Driver problems,"I purchased the Garwin 76CS, then soon afterward purchased both MapSource 'Bluechart' and MapSource 'City Navigator'. The 76CS seems to be in perfect working order, however, once I installed both MapSource programs and unlocked them, either the MapSource programs or my computer will not recognize the GPS unit. I have tried to update the drivers to no end, and I am still having no luck. I have spent around 4 hours on the phone with someone in Garmin's technical department; this has not solved my problem.If anyone has had a simular problem with getting MapSource to recognize the GPS 76CS unit, [...]Thanks.KA"
4,Works well,"I purchased this with the Bluechart Maps on CD. I find it very useful navigating my local costal waters. Of course a big screen would be better, but then it would not be portable."
4,A Book Every Mother Should Have,"I am so sorry to see that this treasure of a book is now out of print. It is chock full of wonderful ideas for mothers to help them to make their homes into fun, exciting, educational places for their children."
5,Notable Black Women Review,I found that this book is very informative for research and for your own information on different types of black women.
3,okay but could have been better,"Shake It Off was yet another smash hit for Mariah Carey upon its release in the late summer of 2005, but all in all, I feel like the song is a work in progress.It's a catchy song, but I do think that the song should've been sped up just a little faster and given more of a beat to it... in that case this song would've been a great Janet-ish dance song, but instead the way it is, is just a catchy r&b; number that has potential but doesn't live up to it. I think this would've made a great r&b;/dance song the way only Janet can make them if they had the guts to just speed it up a little more and given more of a beat to it."
5,Good Single,"Besides ""Shake It Off"", there is a B-side type of song called ""Secret Love"" that is not on the Emancipation CD. I found it very catchy and had it stuck in my head after the first time I listened to it. I think any Mariah fan would enjoy this single because of the video that can be played on your computer as well as the rare song and cover photo."
1,AWW GOSH TERRIBLE,"Mariah really needs to give up. She is getting old and her voice shows it. Not a great album. I really didnt enjoy this album at all, Id rather spent the cash on booze."
3,"Shaken, Not Stirred","For somebody like Mariah Carey, she has really came back with a vengence this past year with her album The Emancipation of Mimi. While it has been a strong revival, there are very few tracks that actually have been fair but not really over the top. her latest single, Shake It Off seems a bit more mellow rather than hypnotic or upbeat like her two previous singles, We Belong Together, and It's Like That. Although it is strong for awhile, and I fairly enjoy the track, I really could've expected quite more from this latest track from a really remarkable diva like her.Song: C 1/2-"
2,I'm Going to Tell You Something That'll Make You Shake Your Head in Disbelief,"Let me give y'all the heads up on this song. It was supposed to be on Janet Jackson' ""Damito Jo"" album, but it never made the cut. Mariah and Jermaine Dupri changed some of the lyrics and- WALA!- another wack song that could be sung by anybody. At least it's not as annoying as ""We Belong Together"", but it's still just as weak and soul-less. A year from now everyone will have forgotten about this song. Actually, let's give it a month."
1,Still Waiting,I purchased this book on 2009 December 14 and I'm STILL WAITING for it to arrive!!!!!!!!!! I will NEVER order anything from this seller again!
5,A great read,"Having grown up on the Atlantic Ocean, this story was captivating to me. It is almost unbelieveable how dangerous the ocean can become in a matter of minutes; the author, Tom Waldron, did a great job of describing the fury of the ocean at it's most violent.Waldron put the story together in a logical, readable format. He included a lot of interesting information about how the ship was built, the history of sailing ships, especially clipper ships, and even included numerous pictures, so one is able to attach faces with names in the narrative.Interesting to me was the description of the life on board the Pride -- lack of space below, lack of showers, etc. A very primitive existance. The vivid descriptions of the storms were captivating -- made the book hard to put down.Finally, the section about the aftermath was most compelling. Waldron described in detail the suffering and emotional roller coaster the survivors went through until their rescue. I recommend this book highly."
2,Outdated,"Reminded me of the old gloves, only lacking the quality.Poorly made will not recommend too many good choices available."
4,"Works pretty well, the best I've found","We have a cat that decided he wasn't using the litter box for a while. We've tried other products like Nature's Miracle (which didn't work for us) and the smell always persisted. As you might know, this smell is just horrid.A coworker suggested Simple Solution, and so far it's worked the best out of anything we've found. Make sure to follow directions (blotting up the liquid after letting it sit for a bit) because otherwise it spreads the mess around and doesn't work nearly as well. While it dries, it doesn't smell bad (again, Nature's Miracle made the smell worse while drying!) and just smells like generic cleaner chemicals.Afterward, the smell is definitely less, although it still smells faintly if you get on the floor and smell the carpet directly, and also sometimes during hot days (it's been 100 degrees F here). Overall, we are super pleased with Simple Solution for the cat accidents."
4,very good,"this product works just the way it says it does. removes stains and odors the 1st time used. very happy, and would order again. only complaint is that it could of been packaged a lot better. cap was broken on arrival. box was pretty banged up with not much packing material inside. luckily nothing spilled and i am using it in a differnt spray type bottle. hopefully next time a little more care is put into the packing and shipping."
5,Simple Solution Stain & odor Remover,"Been using it for years, works great. I have 3 cats and 3 Chihuahuas. Sometimes accidents happen but Simple Solution works first time, everytime."
3,Beef Straganoff,"January 3, 2012I purchased the Beef Stroganoff from Omaha Steakhouse last week. It arrived in a small tray covered with plastic. I didn't really read the instructions for preparation ... just got out my trusty skillet and lid. I popped it out the container and addded just a couple teaspoons of water and let it simmer. It simmered about 15 minutes before I tasted it.. The sauce was delicious and the beef was tender. There was only one thing lacking [noodles]. There was only a tiny beef of egg noodles and alot of meat. Nonetheless, it was tasty. I give it 3 stars."
5,Great Sandals!,Naturalizer are my favorite shoes. Always comfortable right from the get go. The sandals are great. Nice to have shoes to come in Wide sizes also.
2,Lorca fan,"This film is a complete failure. The film never seems to commit itself to taking an actual stand on Lorca's death. The charectors are a banal typecast and hypothesis of what Spain suffered under the Franco regime. The actors are miscast as Spaniards. First Lorca was just over feet tall and pretty ugly by his own accounts. Andy Garcia is tall and handsome, kind of misleading no? They could have at least used some camera tricks to disguise this. The film's holds little historical accuracy and is unengaging. If one wants a better perspective on Spain durring the civil war, I woulds say ""Silencio Roto,"" or even the Orwell inspired ""Land and Freedom."""
4,"Very Moving, if not completely historically correct","This movie was very good. Given that, yes, some of the lines were cheesy and there were some questionable characters(the cab driver and Gabino). Nevertheless, this movie did bring to life the lives that Lorca touched and the beauty of his work. Andy Garcia gave a wonderful performance and his acting was so touching. The only thing that irritated me was that there was a sex scene. I know the old saying,""Sex sells"" but come on! This was not a pornographic movie. This was about a poet and his death. I didn't particularly want to see Esai Morales ""get it on"" with a childhood friend. That was unnecessary. Otherwise, I was moved and inspired by this movie. I bawled my bloody eyes out at the end. Good movie. Please watch it."
3,"Nice cast, terrible idea","The filmmakers really dropped the ball here by concentrating on a reporter trying to find out what happened to Lorca, and almost ignoring what made Lorca so great. The name cast here is very good, the film has an epic feel to it, but Lorca remains a mystery and the ending seems to be lifted from one of those Spanish language soap operas on Univision."
3,A nice introduction to the legendary Al Andalus,"Not everyone knew Garcia Lorca or Andalusia (Al-Andalus, Arabic version) that well-or at all-but this movie will give you a romantic introduction to a remote province in today Spain. The setting took place during the Spanish Civil War, not too long before World War II for those short on their history, but the roots go back to the days when Al Andalus was governed by Muslims.Garcia represent those poets who died at a young age but left masterpieces on their traces. If you like long-historic-romantic poems and controversial plays, then try his works for a size. As a warning, the movie doesn't dwell too deep into the life of Garcia Lorca, rather on his shadowy murder and the endless effort to reveal it. The final outcome still to be discussed and debated properly, but the message into finding the truth-no matter what the cost-is clearly and excellently displayedI personally don't watch movies, but this had to be a significant exception."
5,Very moving,"Although not completely historically accurate, the movie was beautifully done, with wonderful performances. Marcos Zurinaga is the son of my first grade teacher, so that's pretty cool! It's a pity that his fantastic movie, available only in Puerto Rico on video, called ""La gran fiesta"" hasn't been widely distributed in the States."
5,"See this movie, buy this movie.","This movie is beautifully acted, wonderfully filmed, and is the best film I have seen in months. If the Acadamy was not such a bunch of world class idiots this movie would have won lots of metal."
1,"Over produced, underwritten melodrama.","Woefully inept dramatization of the fate of Spanish poet Garcia Lorca. Top-notch cast is thrown away, while the period detail is totally wasted. A good director (not to mention a good screenwriter) could have made this Oscar-worthy. Instead we're stuck with a tepid ""what if"" senario which puts you to sleep long before it makes you think. Sole point of interest is the poetry recited by Andy Garcia as the title character, but for that you can read the author's work and skip this embarrassment."
4,Okay...,I'm a college student. I bought for carring my scores. Not so cheap..But looks cute and strong. Okay..
4,A Classic,"I thoroughly enjoyed this collection of essays on the South. I've read all of Woodward's major works and this rates as one of the best because, throughout, you can see his engagement intellectually with difficult theories and histories. The sections where he engages ""the ironies of Southern history"" are fascinating because he completely challenges the American myth of success in global affairs. His addendum on the aftermath of the Vietnam War is timely as well.His sections on William Faulkner, John Brown, Southern identity, Populism, and Reconstruction are first rate and describe histories as concisely as anything in print. His also goes into some of these issues very well in ""The Origins of the New South."" I cared less for the chapter on Robert Penn Warren because I don't think much of his work has aged well and the chapter on the Guilded Age is less coherent.In sum, this is an important part of Woodward's canon and speaks very well to his importance as a thinker."
2,Poorly copied,"If you are thinking to buy this book - don't. It is a poorly copied version of the stories. You'd be better off buying an actual reprint, especially for the money. This was pricey and poor quality. Other reviewers are misleading as they are referring to an actual reprint, not a copy."
5,A Very Overlooked Album,"This cd is awesome! I love it and am glad that I was able to find it hidden away in a cd store. Not many people have ever heard this album, BUY IT! The songs on here are wonderful. Half Mile of Hell and Lone Star and Coors are my two favorites. Once again Ian is able to write and sing from the heart and he has done an outstanding job! This cd is a must for any Ian Tyson fan!"
4,keia's review,"ok i loved the story. at first i thought well its just gonna be one of those boring stories about boys getting trapped on an island. but as the story progressed, i really just could not put the book down. i loved the way golding uses the boys in the story in comparison with the real world. all of the boys' characteristics each symbolized characteristics of a human being. the book was amazing i recommend that if you get the chance to read it then you should. the island at the beginning of the story is in a state of perfection symbolizing ""Eden"" and by the end of the book it is an image of hell. this shows the transition of good to evil without civilization."
4,True Masterpiece,I thought this was a wonderful book and I think that anyone who has ever wondered what it was like to be trapped on an island should read this book. I think that this was one of the great classics that will never die out.
1,"Lord of the Flies, a black book",This book was sooooo black! Anyone who thinks otherwise can contest it with me.
2,I think that this book needs a little help.....,This book has some definite issues. I was forced to read this book during my sophomore year. The beginning of this book was really slow getting started. When reading this book I was really lost. Towards the end of the book it got a LITTLE better. I would highly recommend have your friends rent the video and all watch it together.
3,"A good book, but...","I love Golding's style of writing, but our English teacher had us read very closely and that was hard. If we didn't have to nit-pick at details, I would have given it a 5. BTW, THANK YOU CLIFF NOTES! YOU'RE A LIFE SAVER!!!"
1,THE WORST,I had to read this book over the summer for an advanced placement english class and it was very confusing and boring. It took me about a month to finish it. There was way too much symbolism and not enough story line.
3,Lord of the Flies,This was a pretty interesting book. It was a little morbid an gruesome at times but overall I thought that the authors point was clearly understandable. I give this book three stars.
1,"Really BAD, twisted and depressing",really depressing and sick minded. Our teacher made us read it and i am sooooo glad it's over
5,A drinker in the BVI,"I've just returned from a wonderful few weeks in the British Virgin Islands where I happened upon the ""The Drinking Man's Guide to the BVI"". With its cartoons, limericks and humourous anecdotes, the book is a really fun read.More importantly, it's full of excellent description of the BVI's best restaurants and wateringholes. We made full use of the freebees (drinks and food) by presenting the booked whereever we dined and so, at only $12, the book paid for itself many times over.I'd recommend it any visitor to the BVI who enjoys the odd tipple. Imagine what fun the author had in researching it!"
2,"Good thriller, lousy DVD.","Bravo MGM; you've managed yet again to screw up a great movie with a terrible DVD. -It's actually an ORION picture, and I'd hoped that they would've cared more about its appearance, but no such luck. Of my 100+ DVDs, this is one of the worst looking with dull colors and a fuzzy image. (Let's hope they're more careful with their upcoming Woody Allen ORION collection.) This is a rather oldfashioned straight-ahead action suspenser like they just don't make them anymore in Hollywood, but it's difficult to be thrilled about that when you know you can enjoy a much sharper version on TV. Hackman, Heard, Cassidy and Jones lead a good cast, but in order to see them clearly we desperately need a remastering of this otherwise wonderful movie. Until then, avoid like the plague."
4,A great political espionage film,The Package is one of the best films about the end of the Cold War. The plot was interesting and easy to follow. The characters were impressive. I don't think that this was a weak or depressing film at all.
3,POLITICAL THRILLER WITH OVERTONES OF THE JFK ASSASSINATION..,"..only in this case, its a Russian premier they are after. The ending, i.e., the very last scene is a macabre twist, which leaves the audience intrigued about who was running it all. Overall a predictably Hollywood production with some inspiration from Oswald findings. Occasionally a well-done action sequence or two injects some life into the picture, but it never really grabs fully, instead leads us to a quick, anticlimactic ending which doesn't reward us for our patience. The pace is commendable, the characters sacrificed for the plot (as in a typical thriller) and the twists and turns are engaging. Worthy rental, nothing more nothing less."
4,A Great Political Suspense Thriller,"Andrew Davis directs this 1989 political thriller starring Gene Hackman and Tommy Lee Jones. A great spy thriller that keeps its audience in mystery and suspense until almost the end. Along with 'Hunt for Red October' and 'Patriot Games', this is one of the better spy/political thrillers to come out of the late 80s and early 90s.In this film, Gene Hackman is an officer stationed in Germany who's assigned to pick up a miscreant soldier (Tommy Lee Jones) coming from Berlin. Hackman loses his precious cargo when in the US and finds some very strange inconsistencies as he searches for him. Uncovering a major political plot, Hackman races against time to clear himself and expose the culprits.An excellent political thriller with very good acting on the part of Hackman and Jones. A good movie to either rent or own."
2,Skip it,"The Package was quite a disappointment considering the presence of Gene Hackman and Tommy Lee Jones among others.A U.S. sergeant witnesses the assassination of a high ranking American military officer during peace talks held in Germany between Washington and Moscow. Shortly after the incident he receives orders to return home accompanying a prisoner. Things quickly become more complicated when `the package' makes a run for it...In short, the acting is all right (though nothing great), while the plot and the dialogues are average and below average respectively.The movie does bring to mind The Fugitive, though this film does not really provide as much entertainment.Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers and the poor choice of lines and weak plot.In a nutshell, it's a mediocre movie and that's about it; no masterpiece here... 2.2 Stars"
2,Yearning for Kojak,"My husband and 19-year-old daughter abandoned me in the TV room about halfway through. They didn't miss much. Tommy Lee had some funny lines. Gene Hackman was good, but it was painful to watch, knowing how much more he can do. I have to watch ""The Conversation"" about 5 more times so I can wash away the bad memory of this clunker. The motivations of the characters were beyond contrived, the music was on the level of Baretta, and the minor players were utterly forgettable. The best scene was in the first quarter of the movie, when Hackman and Jones meet, and some sparks fly. Once that's over, you can watch something else."
2,Pre-packaged thriller cliches,"Gene Hackman plays a career army man who is duped into transporting a prisoner to the US as part of a complicated assassination scheme in this tired, contrived relic of Cold War paranoia. High ranking military officials on both sides are in cahoots to derail disarmament talks and Hackman, along with ex-wife Joanna Cassidy, are the only ones who can stop them. Stock secondary characters are on hand to provide a piece of needed information or pull our heroes' fat out of the fire and then die on schedule as required by the screenplay so that the viewer can feel the Sense of Danger and Urgency. The twists and turns of the plot are uninvolving and the climax is thoroughly conventional. The talented cast does what it can to elevate the proceedings."
2,Lame politcal thriller with a decnt cast!,"This move is a lame political thriiler with a decent cast! Watch this movie only you are fans of Tommy Lee Jones,Gene Hackman , John Heard ot Dennis Franz! Or if love the director's work! i personal like his movies, but I prefer ""Under Siege"" to this movie any day!"
3,DVD The Package,"A Gene Hackman film is generally good, regardless f the plot. This film is no exception."
5,The Package,"Having seen ""The Jackal"" both versions, I think this sort of remake of them is far above par and quite more realistic, with a grain of salt, but the main interest of this movie is Gene Hackman and Tommy Lee Jones. Both actors give an exemplary rendition of their roles and should have gotten oscars. Unfortunately, the plot and scenario do not lend themselves to Oscars. Still highly recommended, I plan to see it again."
2,"Strannix, are you there?","Why did it seem like Tommy Lee Jones was doing his 'Strannix thing"" from ""Under Siege"" in this movie? The plot winds into predictable end that makes you say ""Where have I seen this before?"" The movie seemed like a ripoff of so many other political/assassination-type flicks I've seen before. Not many surprises (if any) in this movie."
2,Look for Region 2,"I received the video ""The Package"" which we were really looking forward to viewing. It didn't work. My fault, because it was marked Region 2 on the video. I didn't realize that it would not play on a VCR in the U.S. I would have thought the vendor would have looked at my address and double checked that I wanted a video that only worked in a foreign country. My Bad - but never again!Worse yet, they would have excepted a return but paying to ship it back would have been almost equal to 50% the price of that video!"
1,The Package aka Killer-Brigade in Germany,"Wanted the American version of this movie, but after waiting a month received a jacket with the title Killer-Brigade and everything was in German. Not sure if English is available, but this is not what I bargained for. Tried to send it back, but the postage that I had to pay to Europe was almost twice the cost of the movie so I kept it. Never will deal with this company again. This is out and out deception."
4,wonderful mystery!,"I really enjoyed this book, will be reading more from this author!! He really keeps you interested throughout."
3,"Good, but not the Best!","I enjoyed reading this book, but found it to be disappointing compared to AFTER DARK. I was just waiting for something more exciting to happen. However, I would recommend this book to anyone who loves suspense."
4,This book like all his others are excellent.,"I have never read a book of Margolins that I did not completely enjoy. He has an extremely dark mind, which is quite similar to Steven Kings. He assunes an air of innocences as he entangles the plot into an unstoppable read. The endings always seem to surprise me."
4,The scariest Mystery I've ever read,"Very good plot - full of twists and excellent tension building scenes. Sometimes the tension was so tight that I almost couldn't stand to read on. A good job of building up to the answer to who dunnit. Complex, but believable. If you want to curl up with a good scary read, read this book!"
2,Doesn't Rise Above The Routine,"The author has an interesting plot but the story doesn't rise above the routine. There are abundant novels about serial killers nowadays and grisly descriptions galore. This one doesn't stand above the crowd.I won't give anything away but toward the end of the novel one of the victims has a gun on the serial killer. She describes what she is going to do to him. The reader's reaction is, ""Oh, for Pete's sake."" Every reader knows what she describes is not going to happen. If this scene was meant to heighten suspense it did not. A very careless and silly blunder by the author. It would have been so much better, and a shocker, if the lady had actually fired a bullet into the killer's kneecap. Or both kneecaps. THAT would have been a surprise."
5,Excellent,This book will scare the pants off you. Really captures your attention immediately. You will really zip through it.
3,"Too predictable, the book","The book started as a great page turner, but ended with as a dud. The author had a chance to nail an awesome, less predictable ending, but choose to wrap the book up neatly and quickly. I would call it more of a story than a mystery. The mystery is over half way through the book."
3,"Not bad, Not Good","Having read so many thrillers and mystery book in the past, I predicted the last half of this book. Even though I knew what to expect, I still enjoy but will say that its not too bad and its not all that great. Characters were really well develop and the plot wasn't too bad. Overall its an average book. For a good read try ""Bone Collector"" by Jeffery Deaver, J.R.R Tolkien's ""Lord of Rings"" series, or any of John Grisham's books"
5,Best Book of The Year,"I have always been into murder books, but this is the best one I've read yet! I started reading it for a cless project and I can't put it down. I haven't read the ending yet but I'm pretty sure who the killer is. I would recommend this book to anyone no matter what books they like to read."
1,This is not a good book!,"I can't understand why people rave about this book. Technically (as a police procedural or plotting ), this book doesn't work at all. The first technical flaw that raised my eyebrow occurred around page 60 when they allowed the husband of the last victim to become part of the investigational team. No police department in the country would allow that to happen - I don't care how well-connected someone may be. Unfortunately, I can't specifically comment on the plotting without giving away the ""surprises"" (which, by the way, there were none). Suffice it to say that I didn't find anything in the book based in reality or half-way ""believable."" The psycho-babble just didn't ring true. I labored through this book and I couldn't wait to get to the end just to see if I had it figured out. Well, there wasn't much to figue out; and the ending? Please. I didn't buy any of it! It was a lousy book."
2,Unbelievable,I really mean 'unbelievable' or silly or u get the idea.On a scale of ten with ten being best - this book would get a two from me; and that two is because it is quite readable but the overall story is ridiculous. Enough said!
2,BESTSELLER???? REALLY???,"I'm sorry, i dont understand what all the hype is with this book. I found myself losing patience with the predictable plot over and over again. Theres no real 'suspense' here just a lot of gore thats bareley believable and is, i guess, supposed to shock you into being suprised??? Whatever, i've read better books, way better...many that havent made it into the best seller lists.(which makes me wonder what really drives these lists)This is a lifetime movie on steroids. If thats your kind of thing... enjoy.( and yes, i AM a woman)"
2,"Unlike other Margolin books, this strains believability","Usually an excellent story teller, Margolin has relied on a completely predictable ""plot twist."" Worse, the twist depended on his experienced and other-wise intelligent protagonist doing something that not even a half-wit attorney would do (nor would even a half-wit reader believe)."
1,One of the worst,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The plotting is beyond belief and full of holes. People are dropping like flies and no one seems to care. Darius murders his own wife and little daughter in cold blood and still gets a pardon? Years later four other bodies are found in one place and police are heard laughing at the scene of the fifth murder, only a few days later. I could go on and on but just had to get this off my chest."
4,First-rate suspense writing . . .,"This is the first book I've read by this author, having had him recommended to me by several friends, and I wish I hadn't waited so long. His plotting is complex but understandable (if you pay attention), his characters are very true-to-life, and the action is nicely-paced. In this case, it's a serial killer (sort of), a lady lawyer who becomes his attorney (without at first knowing what he is), a D.A. who tries too hard, and a governor about to be confirmed to the Supreme Court with a secret in his political past. This would probably make a terrific movie, but I don't know what you could cut to get it down to size. I'm definitely going to be reading more of Margolin."
5,Gone but not forgotten,Fantastic thriller all the way through .keeps you wanting more and more . The writing is unreal real page turner. This is one of the best reads in a long whole. To all who read it enjoy
1,blank!,"I did order this set several months ago, but am just getting around to watching it. The first disc in the set is blank, and I am being sent in circles when attempting to return"
3,Not Happy,"I purchased this item because it was it was suppose to fit my Sansa View, well it didn,t come close and was not worth the time to send back."
2,I completely agree with E.F. Williams.,"I bought this product from amazon, even after reading these reviews, because ipodlounge gave it very high marks. But I had the same problem, it doesn't fit quite right, and curls up away from the screen at the top, plus has a gap in the back that's not necessary. Luckily I also purchased the Contour Design Showcase hardshell case for my new ipod, and love that one. So at least one of my cases worked out!"
5,WoW,"This book is great,I'm an experice wrestler in collegit,Greco Roman and freestyle. i have also done some sambo and judo.this book really gave me a cutting edge. it help me beat people on the streets who wanted to ""test"" my skill,outside of mats and rules.y goal is to be in the FC some day and this book will help any one from a 6 yearold to a eldely"
2,A good price but .....,"The sound is good, when you listen to the radio.The sound is good, when you listen to your MP3 player through this machine.The sound is NOT-SO-GOOD when you listen to a CD. You can 'hear' the CD player when it plays your CD's. You can hear the machinery of the CD player itself. If you turn down the volume, I could hear a high pitch sound coming from the player. You can hear the CD playing BUT you can also hear this ""sound"" too. NOT GOOD. I tried two times.......I returned the origianl player and got a new one......same problem.Byer beware!!"
2,Review,Pretty good product. The shipping came really fast. It's a nice stereo for the price that it is offered at.
2,Not impressed,"This is the first and only Vonnegut book I have read. I was unimpressed. The dialogue was mediocre. The characters were mediocre. The plotting was mediocre. Character development was poorly executed. Plus he's a horrible futurist. His ""future"" has held up worse under time than virtually any other SF book I can think of. It's completely unbelievable."
4,Not so funny,This is Vonnegut's first book and is not the typically satirical comedies it is more of serios view of a second industrial age. The book is very thoughtfull and worth a read if your a Vonnegut fan you need to get this book because it provides intersting difrences from his later works but I would not suggest this as a first read of his books.
4,A slow starter,I've read a couple of Vonnegut novels and have fallen in love with his style of writing from the very beginning. He's is the first author i've had the pleasure of reading where i'm not consistently looking ahead to see how many pages are left in the book. Every book that i've read by him i find myself upset when the story is done. Player piano is no exception. Since I enjoyed Vonnegut's books so much i figured i'd start with his first published novel. This book started off slow but it wasn't tough to follow the story line and stay somewhat interested. By the end of the book i found myself in awe of Vonnegut's insight of the human race. He seems to be able to see the world from a much higher plateau. One part i found particularly interesting was after the rebellion the only listed injuries to the immediate crew were caused by them trying to tame their own people from causing too much harm to the city. Overall a very enjoyable reading experience .... now it's on to Sirens of Titan.
5,Great Book!,This a great mind-opening book. I recommend it to all distopic literature lovers and the ones who want to discover it.
4,Pretty Good,"It wasn't the greatest dystopian I've read recently, but it was still pretty good. I felt that the society Vonnegut created was believable, and he did a great job of displaying the emotions of the people made useless by machines."
2,Doesn't nearly aproach Vonnegut's potential,"Although I consider myself an avid reader of Vonnegut, I was surprised to find that I couldn't help finding this book kind of childish in the simplicity of it and its message. Don't get me wrong! I love Vonnegut. I'm just saying that this book happens to be an exception to his great work, possibly because it was his first and his style hadn't fully matured then. The true Vonnegut books that I recommend reading, are 'Slaughter-House-five' and 'Mother Night.' Please don't dissmiss Vonnegut as a bad writer if you don't like this book or hear that it isn't good. It is not in any way representational of what Vonnegut can do. Go read 'Slaughter-House-Five' and you'll witness the true power of Vonnegut's art."
3,For die-hard fans,"I have been a big fan of Kurt Vonnegut for many years, and I've enjoyed several of his books immensely. This one got lost on my overstuffed bookshelves for many years until I recently found it. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the many other books I've enjoyed by this author. That's not to say it wasn't good; this man vs. machine story set in the future is dated and relevant at the same time. The description of ""future"" machines is unintentionally amusing, considering our computerized world, yet the theme of man being displaced by machines is still timely.The books starts off slowly; if you can make it through the first third, you'll do OK. It never really builds beyond that point, but it's never boring, either. Still, fans should take a look at this one, because it's early Vonnegut, and he's beginning to show the style and humor that have made him so popular."
2,The only Vonnegut novel I did NOT like,"Vonnegut is a humane, funny, and unpredictable writer. I have read all of his books and short stories, and this is the only one I just did not like. The style is very straightforward, and in a word, boring.If this is the only Vonnegut you've read, it is not representative of his work as a whole. Try ""Breakfast of Champions"" or ""Slaughterhouse Five"" to discover his simultaneously hilarious and heartwrenchingly (what a word!) prose. Read Vonnegut's ""Welcome to the Monkey House"" for one of the best collection of short stories around."
3,Hard to get into.,"I have read three Vonnegut books. I loved Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse Five, so I decided to read his first book, and was disapointed. It was good, but it took me many tries before I could really sit down and get into it, and that doesn't happen to me very often. It has a really slow start, and I can't decide whether it ends up being worth the trouble."
4,An Accurate Prediction of the Future,"I think most of the reviewers missed the boat on this one. This is probably one of the most accurate predictions of the future I have read. All it needs is an update in computer nomenclature, and this could have been written yesterday. Think about it: How many craftsmen have been replaced by the kind of machines he describes? How many ""engineers"" are walking around today, who have never physically built anything? How useless is a high school diploma in today's job market? Planned obslescence, artificial economies-The only thing he got wrong was the world war (at least for now). And yes, I realize the irony of writing this review on a computer."
5,"From a different perspective, mine.","When Vonnegut wrote this novel, I was a young lad and lived in the same upstate village of Alplaus, NY. Kurt was a PR person for General Electric. And, so because of this he became associated with GE scientists. When I first read Player Piano, I was amazed at the similarity with that small village. As I read, the fictional characters became evident. Local village scientists. I won't name names..I found this somewhat interesting having know some of them as a youngster. Kurt used to rent a room above a nearby home. Mrs. Cheney's. Just to go and write. And, remove himself from his house which overlooked the Alplaus Creek.This is just a bit of literature history that few know. Just an insight. Trust that you enjoyed it. And, how great authors get their background for novels. Yes, he did use my mom as a very brief character. They were friends."
4,one of Vonnegut's best novels,"One of Vonnegut's best novels; certainly his most traditionally narrative and coherent. In the glorious future, machines have freed man from most types of labor, and simplified the categorization of people. Everyone is tested scientifically for IQ, personality, and aptitude; everyone's life determined by the tests. Most people spend most of their time bored; they cannot compete for the few real jobs available, most of them in engineering, and must choose between the Army and the Reconstruction & Reclamation Corps. Only the few, like Dr. Paul Proteus, have IQs high enough to make them more useful than computers. Proteus gets involved in a minor revolution, but it is ultimately to no end. Progress is inevitable, but what is good for the body may not be good for the soul"
3,Uncertain,"Well, for the price, you would think that they would atleast stick. There is no adhesive in these. Nothing like a bandaid. I have to use medical tape as soon as I put them on. I read that you have to wash them daily? Kinda weird. I do, but it doesn't help with them sticking. I don't know if they are helping my scar or not, it hasn't been very long. But I'm very dissappointed that I have to use medical tape, cause now I can't wear them during the day without looking like I have a war wound. I was expecting to just put it on like a bandaid and go about my business..there is more up-keep then I had hoped for."
1,This stuff is terrible.,"Doesn't stick, is thick & ugly, and doesn't work. Even when reinforced with various kinds of bandage tape, in the morning I would find ""migrated patches"" on my bed sheets or PJs. Also, I saw no improvement in my leg scars."
2,minor improvement,"I used it for about 6 weeks and saw only marginal improvement. I was treating two scars, so I wasn't about to go drop another $30 on something that wasn't working too well to begin with. I also had problems with them staying on; they made me sweat under the patches and then they'd bunch up and fall off. Not recommended."
3,Move the speaker!,"It appears that the speaker is located on the power plug. My power socket is inside my center console, so I would never hear the voice directions. I guess it's back to the Magellan 700 page."
2,Hard drive failed on two seperate models,"When the unit is working, it is a 4-5 star unit. I received my first 2620 for Mother's Day 2 years ago. I live in Fl and have traveled all over FL, Hawaii, Alaska, NY, Canada, Washington, PA, and most of the east coast states. There were road updates and many points of interest that were out of date but overall this system, we named Betty, has been a life saver. Before the warranty expired in the first year, ""Betty"" would continue to recycle the boot up screen.Garmin customer service was great. They stated that this had been a known problem in some units and replaced her free of charge. They even transferred all the way points. Within another year, the second unit is now having the same problem. Garmin has offered the option to fix/replace the second unit for $150.00 and a 3 month warrenty.I plan on doing more homework into other GPS models to ensure I will be able to get more than a year use of them before I spend another dollar."
3,frustration,"I purchased this unit to help me on a recent trip to Denver. When I went to use it in my rental, no maps could be found. I called cust serv and they sent me a new one the next day. Plugged the new one in and it was searching for signal for hours. Turns out certain cars have too much stuff in their windshields and it blocks the signal. Cust serv sent next sent an external antenna the next day and this fixed the problem. The unit works fine after all of the wasted time. Their customer service was very nice, but they only operate Monday thru Friday. I was able to use the unit for two days of my vacation. They should have more useful info on their Web site and offer more hours for customer service."
5,Great Lower Cost Auto GPS,The data base on the HD is excellent and it correlates to satellites very quickly. I would reccomend the optional external antenna.
2,Great System for a limited time.,"This was a great system for about a year or so, when it worked. The problems started occuring one by one after about a year.- The remote control stopped working first- In about 2-3 months after that, the unit stopped being able to read the maps completely.I tried to contact their customer service department and they were helpful in replacing my remote control. However to get the dang unit to work again, I would have to pay them about $300 (not to mention the original charge of $1,000+ for the unit).I would not recommend this specific product (Garmin 2620)."
3,not what i expected,"an awkward interface, really old maps, clumsy set-up. i wish i had gotten the magellan. for this level of money it should work easily and well. this doesn't. but if you are the type of person who misses dos commands on your computer, this could be the navigator for you. just wait until you are in the bronx and it puts you in the wrong place and then tells you it doesn't have the a strong satellite signal. a lot of trouble for what what should seem straightforward. a lot of hype, a lot of money, and just not worth the trouble or the money. but make me an offer..."
1,2 defective units in a week,"Unable to find if this GPS is any good, since first unit started rebooting after 1 1/2 hours, then the replacement unit I received a week later began rebooting when first turned on.According to Amazon, ""the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement."" Interesting, while the 2620 is still offered for sale."
5,A hard Struggle,Small Steps was really a great book. I learned alot about the disease Polio and It was very interesting. Its about a girl named Pat who gets Polio at a young age and fights a hard struggle to get through it. I was so glad when she drank that milk shake and she could finally swallow and eat agian. It was like the milk shake saved her life. I really suggest this book to everyone and they will learn so much about Polio and that no matter how hard something is you can never give up!
5,Important part of history,"This book gives a child's account of a very devastating illness. For most young people today polio is not a threat. This telling of the times will help youth know what a positive outlook, support and love of family and friends, and dedicated medical staff can do to help overcome serious illness. It also strongly has the message that we must be kind and helpful to others. Peg Keret gave so much just by telling of her experience.thank you for such a meaningful story."
5,Courage,This is a very good book because it tells a story about a young girl who gets polio and her journey through it. She never stopped beliving in herself. This is a good book for any reader.
5,Peg Kehert's Small Steps amazed me!,I love Small Steps! It made me feel like I was in the hospital going through what she was going through. Peg really expressed her feelings. She is a great author. I'm sure it brought back good and bad times when she was writing this book! I will never in my life forget about this book!!!
5,"I thought it was an excellent book, !","I thought the book was excellant because it was about a little girl who had three kinds of polio. She found lasting friendships with six other girls who shared the same illness. It was filled with compassion, grace, and true to life experiences."
4,a great begging to an epic series,To tell the truth I am not a huge king fan. I have tried to read a few of his books and just couldn't do it. Then one day a saw this book and thought that I might give it a try since it looked more like a fantasy novel than his usual horror novel. I had to read only about 10 pages in and I was hooked. I really like how he kept a lot of the stuff having to do with the tower a mystery. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because it seemed like I had read the first chapter in a mutch larger story. Anyway if you like or don't like King this is a good book and I will now begin to read the sequal. Great job mister King you truly have a lot of talent when it comes to writing storys.
5,Intensely engaging.,"With ""The Gunslinger,"" Stephen King hooked me for life. Never before had I read a tale so haunting, so eerie and engaging that I was forced to read it again and again. Brilliantly devised situations and desolate landscapes focus the tale about the inner workings of a troubled hero. King produces his most memorable character to date in the form of Roland. His quest, shady and romantic, urges the audience to read on."
5,Introduction to the Dark Tower,"The first volume in the Dark Tower series might not be as good as the rest, especially in the raw writing of Stephen King's earlier days, but I still loved it and had fun with it. I gave my only copy to a friend my freshman year of high school, and now I kind of regret it. The thing I love most about this book is it's fantasy elements, and the Man in Black is a great character."
3,The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger,"The Gunslinger is the first novel of this epic series, The Dark Tower. The Dark Tower shows stephen Kings's excellent achievment.I recomend reading this book.A few of the characters are Roland and Jake Chambers. Roland was Jake Chambers predecesor and a gunslinger. Jake is the boy that Roland met at the Way Station. Jake was hit by a cadillac in the other world,because Roland chose to pursuit the man in black rather than save him.Other characters are Cort, The Man in Black. Cort was Roland's teacher in Tull. The Man in Black has no true identity. I really enjoyed reading this book, when you start reading you really get hooked into it and dont want to put the book down."
3,A so-so start to a great series,"This book was one of King's first, written his senior year of college and it has all the flaws of a budding novelist. The language is sometimes verbose and the imagery is a bit abstract, but all in all this is a good first chapter to the Dark Tower Series and a must read, if only for Walter's diatribe at the end of the book."
4,A good yarn with lots of twists,"I usually never read Stephen King books. However, I was intruiged by the title of book 4, so i bought it and when i realized it was part of a series, i ran out and bought books 1 & 2. I started book one and was immediately drawn in to the world that he created. The character of Roland seems to be very deep--i never know when something from his past is going to come up. I didn't like the character of Jake. I don't really see what overall purpose he served--other than the one he did. I can't wait to start the next book."
3,"Not one of Kings Best, but it has possibilites","I must admit that I am used to Kings books being faster paced with a lot of information about the characters. This book was not like that. Roland is a gunslinger trying to get to The Dark Tower. The book leads you through the desert of Rolands world with a few flashbacks to younger times. The flashbacks were interesting as I was always feeling that I wanted more information about Roland, the main character. I guess I will have to read the rest of the series to find out more. All in all this book is an ok start to the series ""The Dark Tower"" and I will read the next book ""The Drawing of the Three"" to see where King leads Roland."
1,Unreadable,"As a huge King fan, I finally decided to start reading the Dark Tower series. Unfortunately, this first book is pure drivel. I had to force myself to read beyond the next word. While I was hoping for a saga on the level of The Stand, instead all that exists in this book is an incredible disjointed series of stories that go nowhere and are so intensely boring that they are impossible to follow. Epic fail."
1,All the positive reviews are misleading,"Gunslinger is the worst book I have ever had the mispleasure of reading. DON'T believe all the gushing reviews that praise this trash. The characters are flat, the story is skeletal and the book reads like fan fiction. It was probably King's grade school writing assignment -- no kidding. The grammar is awful. The book abounds with errors and incosnistencies. I couldn't wait for it to be over."
1,BIG LETDOWN,I purchased this book because of all of its glowing reviews. Imagine my surprise when i began reading it to find it repulsive and not the least bit entertaining. King has had many wonderfull works in his career but this series is deffinatly not one of them. Boreing and not worth the effort.
3,"The Gunslinger - It grows on ya, what can I say","The Gunslinger is not your typical Stephen King book (though to use typical and Stephen King in the same sentence seems a tad odd at best). The Gunslinger is one of those novels that you have to be concentrated to read, it has it's own language (kinda like Lord of the Rings in that sense) and will given even the most determined reader difficulty. I say all of this not to deter you but, just to warn you. In general it took me awhile to get through this book as it took me awhile to get through Fellowship of the Ring by Tolkien. The book overall I'd have to say is one those books that grows on you as time passes, and your exhausted somewhat by the end of it but, not really in asmuch a negative way."
5,Greatest Prologue,"This book is the start of the arguably greatest series of books ever written. The GunSlinger starts us on a journey with Roland, a man who is looking to find the Dark Tower to stop his world from decaying into debris. This book gives excellent detail, back story, gun smoke action and horrific underground creatures. A perfect book for Horror and Fantasy fans alike."
4,In the beginning...,"The Gunslinger begins the saga of Roland, an old west style gunfighter lost somewhere in a strange parallel world. It is a classic story of good vs. evil and only begins a race to the mythical Dark Tower. This book is a short fast read that sets up the plot for the Dark Tower series. The characters are imaginative and interesting, although King leaves allot of holes in the puzzles their pasts (to be pieced together in later installments). As a stand-alone book, it's average King but it's obviously essential if you want to try on this epic multi-book quest. A decent read that will leave you scrambling for answers in Part 2."
3,"Not the best book ever, but the gateway to greater things.","I did not find The Gunslinger itself to be an enjoyable read, at all. The pacing was odd, the voice was bleak, the writing rather juvenile, even after a clean-up attempt by a much older King, and the ending was nigh incomprehensible to me. After reading it, I had absolutely no plans of pursuing the Dark Tower series further.But!A friend (to whom I am eternally indebted) practically force-fed me the second book of the series, The Drawing of the Three, and from there I was hooked. The rest of the series captivated me. It made me laugh and (toward the end) cry so hard that I occasionally had to put the book down and compose myself before I could keep reading. These days I'm an evangelical DT fan, pestering everyone I know to try the series. It's just such a bother that I have to tell everyone ""You won't like this, but read it, the other six are amazing."""
3,A must re-read after the other 3,"What you must remember is this is a prolog. A long prolog, but a prolog just the same. It is an introduction of characaters. I read the books and listend to them on audio, ( mom has gone blind and can not read any more, she gobbled the 4 book series up. Mom liked W & G more then me.) and I really like Frank Muller. F.M. is an excellent reader, If you are going to do the series, you have to do 1. Its a little slow and when I first read was disapointed not realising it was a prolog. but I would suggest you read ( or listen to ) first before going to 3 which is great. By the way book 2 is also a prolog!"
2,All Cult Classics Are Not Equal,"Hmmmm. I got talked into starting The Dark Tower by several friends who (a) know I have read most of Stephen King's work and (b) have taste that I largely agree with. So I've now made it through the first (short) book that makes up the seven-book series. I had started it many, many years ago and quickly abandoned it, finding it not up to his other works and just not interesting enough to make up for that. Having now finished it, I can say I think both of those facts remain true for me. It's too purposefully mystical and I think largely kind of silly (though not fun-silly). However. I'll continue with the series. I'll read the next book (which I've been told is infinitely better) and eventually probably read all seven. Because I'm that reader who, once he starts, finishes. Unless they start to feel like the kind of head-spinning fun-less work that this one was. At that point, I may abandon my quest. But for now, I'll give the impossible dream a shot."
2,Reading with Tequila,"The Gunslinger, the first book in Stephen King's Dark Tower series, is a strange tale, a sort of post-apocalyptic western with magic. The elements are rarely seen together and I can't say that they mesh all that well.The book bounces back and forth through Roland's life. The flashbacks to his childhood were infinitely more interesting than his present chase of The Man in Black. Seeing bits and pieces of what makes Roland chase this man beyond all hope of survival is the only thing that makes the story bearable.Sometimes too fast, sometimes too slow and always too confusing, The Gunslinger is not an enjoyable read. As much as it pains me, I have to admit not liking this book. The afterward by Stephen King describing his writing the book and his plans (or lack thereof) for the series make the reading worth it. I've heard many promises of good things to come in The Dark Tower and can only hope that struggling through this book will be worth it."
1,tried again,"Tried to read this yet again and yet again have no idea why people like this book. Slow, plodding, awful dialog."
3,Filler,This is all just filler because this new rating system is crap and I don't have that much to say about this product.
1,Still don't know what is going on or care....I gave up.,"I was listening to the Audio CD version and after about the 5th CD, I didn't care anymore. And still didn't know what was going on. I don't care about the description of the fire etc..."
3,Don't bother with the sample chapter download,"I had heard a lot of good things about this series, so I thought I would check out the sample chapter to see how I liked it. Unfortunately, the sample chapter download for the Kindle is nothing but author forward, with no story included. I may buy the book anyway, but certainly not based on the sample.Unfortunately, I can't submit this review without actually rating the book, so I'm giving it a default of 3 stars. Please be aware that I have NOT read the book, yet, so this is not a real representation of the book itself."
1,What IS this mess?,"Generally, when I read a book, I know who I am reading about, and am going from place to place in a logical and chronological sequence, with sufficient reason given whenever an unexpected timeshift occurs. Instead, I am given a character whom I know NOTHING about (his name isn't even given until midway through!), chasing someone for god-only-knows-what reason, going somewhere with no area description at all, and randomly switching time periods to somewhere and somewhen which, again, we know nothing about. How ANYONE is expected to be able to follow this is beyond comprehension."
5,This book rocks,"If you thought Stephen King was only about horror then you my fellow readers were wrong. Stephen King has created a whole new world of adventure, love, terror and impossibilities from his own imagination. In the beginning Roland, the last Gunslinger, is chasing a man named Walter across a desert. During his chase he meets a boy named Jake from New York. Jake was sent to this world by dying in his own. Over a period of time Roland grows fond of Jake. And Jake like wise grows fond of Roland. But Roland is so obsessed with the Dark Tower that he would rather Jake die than loose the trail of the man named Walter. In the end Roland finally catches up with Walter and learns about his future from him. A future that looks rather promising."
2,slow and difficult,"I have read every Stephen King book but 3 and those are next. This is one of the worst. It took me a year to plod through this short book. That being said, by the time I finished I could not wait to pick up the next one in the series. I think of it this way, it was like the first chapter in a book of normal length. I'm about to start the last book in this series and just can't wait. To everyone out there who may have just read the first and gave up, DON'T. Keep reading."
4,The First in the Saga is a Worthy Introduction,"""The man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed.""Mention these words to a reader of King's Dark Tower saga and you will be able to see the effect that the Dark Tower has had on his or her life. The Gunslinger, the first in the series, pales in comparison to, but is a good indicator of, the quest a reader is embarking on when choosing to read the series. While most would agree that this is one of the weaker volumes in the series, it is a great start and sets up the story to come. Definitely read this book. If you like it, continue on, but if you don't like it, do not judge the entire series based on this one. At least read the next book to make your decision on whether or not to continue with the series."
4,Good start of the series,"Being a constant Stephen King fan, I have not really paid much attention to this series over the years. But decided when I got the Kindle to jump in. It seems to be quite a story, fasinating, scary, and even thought provoking. I am very happy with this book and have started the next. But I know that Stepehn King will not disappoint."
3,"This book is just ok, but you have to read it. NOW!","I had to make two attempts to read this book. The first time, I put it down about 50 pages in, bored. I decided it just wasn't for me. A decade later, after having so many people lambaste me for not having read this series, I tried again.I am so glad I did.This first book is just OK. It's a decent read. It isn't anywhere near King's best (and it shouldn't be, being so early in his career), but it is SO WORTH READING. This mediocre book starts you on one of the greatest literary journeys you will ever take. Get this book, power through it, and from there onward this entire series is 5-stars all the way!!Hile, Gunslinger!"
1,Rewritten to be better?,"If this is so, I can only imagine the original mess. The work is erratically plotted, spotted with pointless obscenity, useless characters and vocabulary errors--and contains not one element which draws me to continue. In ""On Writing,"" King talks about ""creating a place you never want to leave."" I couldn't wait to leave the world of the ""Gunslinger"". It's a shame. I like the way King assembles his words. I was hoping for something I could read without becoming nauseated. (Not NAUSEOUS!)"
2,I thought I was settling in for a long and epic series....,I'm not really sure what to say other than I was unable to finish it; I got to around page 140 but picked up another book and never finished it.
3,Sample is bad!,"I agree with the previous reviewer: the sample is bad. It is all intro, no actual text from the story. How can I make a buying decision based on this?"
2,A Dissappointment from a Great Writer,"Stephen King is a terrific writer, but The Gunslinger was a disappointment. Most of the book had just enough suspense to keep one reading, but it was boring and the ending was unsatisfying. Some events, such as the characters being attacked by the slow mutants, were put in simply for suspense; and had little to do with the plot."
3,Hoping it gets better,"I have read this first book of the series and frankly am not too sure why it has such a following. Fans of this series compare it to LOTR and to me they have nothing in common at all. I guess it just isn't my kind of story. The forward mentions movie The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and I do see a similarity there. Mainly in that the Good is maybe not so good, the Bad is maybe not so bad and the Ugly...well, yeah he is ugly. But in a way they are all ugly and all bad, with just a hint of some good thrown in. Some say it is the quest that they like, but after reading just one book, I can't see that the quest is that interesting. I don't know if I will read any more of this series or not. I give it 3 stars because for me this is an average book with an average story. Nothing great about it and I am not sure if I have ever read anything worse than this, maybe years ago when I had to read something for school."
5,The best yet,"This book had me hooked from when I started it and read the opening line of ""The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed"". The world that King creates is so strangely like our own. The only thing about this book is that he spends too much time on flashbacks and doesnt explain enough about them. It takes only a little away from the book and the rest is enough to keep you reading long into the night. I cant wait to get the next one! Keep writing Mr. King, and give us a 5th book soon!"
2,"sorry, this one just didnt grab me","I just want to say it's not a problem with the author. I have read It, The Stand, and Under The Dome and loved them all. I look forward to reading more of King's work. This one sadly just didn't work for me. The world just wasn't explained enough, couldn't understand the character's motiviations, some kid just gets dropped out of the sky from another dimension, high speech vs low speech (what does that even mean anyway). It got to the point I was so preoccupied figuring out wha and what everyone was that I lost track of the story I was reading. Just distracting.I got halfway through, realized I didn't remember half of what had already happened, and didn't care how it ended. I hate giving up in the middle of a book but it just would have been forced."
5,"The Gun Slinger ""Dark Tower Series""","Excellent! This is a good read. It starts out a bit slow, but soon captures you and draws you into the story."
2,Not impressed,"My favorite part of the book was the thoughtful and candid introduction by King, ""On Being Nineteen."" It's downhill from there. Being in between books by Rothfuss, Abercrombie and Martin I grabbed this thinking it might measure up. Not even close. I'm not going to say it's awful, and was a step up from the last Sci Fi book I read, Neal Ambrose's Snow Crash. But I found myself dreading the book, which is not the relationship I like to have with what I'm reading. It seemed clear that King wrote this at an annoying age, when we all think we know everything and are the deepest souls in the world. Much of the story sounds like a first year college student, just discovering mushrooms, blabbing on about the infinity of the universe. I'd love to know King's honest opinion of this book. I'd be proud of it for sure, but would probably provide an intro later in life, like he did, making sure to explain that I wrote it at 19."
5,Unbelievable imagination,"The Dark Tower novels are like Tolkien on steroids. King weaves characters in and out as their purposes are fulfilled, aiding Roland in his quest for the Dark Tower."
5,Inspirational,"The very fact that it took Stephen King years to finish this book is something of an inspiration. It is an excellent introduction to the very real world of the Gunslinger, of Jake, and Oy. Apparently inspired by the Lord of the Rings, I think it surpasses even Tolkien in its sheer scale and ambition - If not with this first chapter in the Dark Tower series then certainly as a whole. Anyone who has readBlack Book Part 1: The Devil's Bloodwill know how influential this story can be. Bravo."
2,"Necessary background, but not a great read","The Dark Tower series is a must-read for Stephen King fans and The Gunslinger (Volume 1) is necessary to fully understand the back story and the rest of the works. That said, it's not that great a book on its own. It has a different feel and pace from the other books. Fortunately it's by far the shortest of the series. So put in the effort on this one to enjoy the rest of the series. I found The Drawing of the Three (Volume 2), The Wastelands (Volume 3) and Wolves of the Calla (Volume 5) to be the most entertaining on their own while still advancing the overall series thread."
2,Huh?,"This is a surreal work of fiction. It starts out slow, goes nowhere and makes very little sense. Not sure what all the hype was about. I certainly will not be continuing with this series."
4,Good start,"This novel is indeed a good start to a series, however there are too many flashbacks without any real discriptive histories. The character Roland isn't developed like King's other characters, he seems to try and grow without letting the readers have a foundation. I've started book two, and can say honestly that King's growth as an author is evident."
3,What the Heck is Going On?,"""The Gunslinger"" has no easily understandable plot. It is the introduction to the epic that follows. In the beginning, I was hopelessly confused. I had no idea why Roland was looking for the man in black, where he was, where he was from, or what the heck was going on. By the end of the book, I knew a little more, but not enough. Maybe that is why so many are addicted to this series.Beware: this is a bloody, dark, and violent tale with a main character you aren't sure whether to cheer for or despise. Is he a hero.....or what? Now I will have to read at least the next book in the series to see if I can learn any more. But this book in itself was an unsatisfying read. I don't know if I want to sign up for the 7-volume-epic ride. Especially if they are all as bizarre as this one."
4,The Gunslinger,"As many other people have said, including Stephen King himself, this book is quite a bit different from his normal horror-style books. The writing in the book is done well, and leaves a certain amount of mystery that leaves you wanting to read on about Roland of Gilead, the gunslinger himself. Unfortunately, the vague past given about Roland can leave people confused or just make them loose interest. The first book is slightly different from the later books, but it is interesting in its own ways. The little links to our world definately add to the story, making you really think about the world you're reading about. This book is definately worth reading, but be prepared to have the urge to read the rest of the sprawling series."
1,how the mighty have fallen....,"Stephen King is one of the greatsest writers, alive or dead. However, when I came to read the start of what I thought was going to be a fantastice, un-put-downable series, I was sorely disappointed. I read it all in one hour, in the hope of finding a half decent paragraph which made any sense, but I didn't. Never mind, King, one failure out of many successes isn't so bad, but still....."
1,feels like rambling to me,"poorly written story. much of it seems rushed and just doesnt make sense. i am a fan of steven king horror books, but this story sucks. i felt no excitement or sense of completion at the end of the story, no sense of climax. i know this is a series, but there is no sense of reward when finishing this volume."
1,Dark Tower,I enjoyed all 7 books in the series up until the last title - The Dark Tower - only to find the ending a complete disappointment. This was especially disheartening since the series itself took about 10 years to come out and I had been waiting years in between for each volume. I have enjoyed most of the Steven King novels I have read particularly the non-horror titles such as Dragon Tears and The Dead Zone. This final novel in the Gunslinger series however disappointed completely. I would like to see it republished with an ending that is fitting of the talent of the author.
1,It's a guy thing.,"I couldn't get into it. I'm a woman and I was either bored to tears, or felt like I was watching a western on TV for the millionth time. Maybe like some Clint Eastwood westerns, it appeals more to guys than women. For me that was it anyway."
5,Roland begins his journey,"I am not going to go into detail, I see a this has already been done quite well. This is the first book in the Dark Tower series and it was great. I thought the writing was superb and the story enthralling. If you enjoy Stephen Kings novels be sure to check this book out. I recommend this book."
4,Better than expected...,... and not as good as the second book. Looking forward to reading the rest!!!
3,I love King but was not ready for this.,"Now I have read about 5 of Kings books and most of them were written in a way that flows and is very enjoyable to me. This book however, seemed to jump around alot and be hard to stick with. The storyline was interesting and the action is awsome but the overall writting style put me off and that is why I gave this book 3 stars."
2,Mmm....,This book is light compared to his other stuff. I didn't mind it though. I'm half way through his second novel Drawing of The Three and I'm liking it much better.
1,Really Boring,"Not to totally down Stephen King (because I am a fan!) I couldn't get through this book. I'm sorry, but it was just so BORING. It is a western, which is not what Stephen King writes. It wasn't a pleasant read for me, unfortunately. Sorry Stephen, but this series was just unreadable for me!"
3,"Great Book, bad sales",I love this book and couldn't get the second one in the series quick enough. Felt the same about the third. That's when it happened. I have been reading these on my Kindle and when I went to get the third one it is not availiable from Amazon. Are you kidding??? I can buy the paper version from them. I love the Kindle system but this may be the straw that broke the Kindle's back for me. I actually got the book for a dollar cheaper and down loaded it to my iPad. No problem at all. So Amazon it sad that you can't even support your own stuff.
3,Enjoyable enough to continue on to book 2...,"I've been a Stephen King fan since I was about 9 and 20 years later I'm finally taking on one of the Dark Tower novels I've heard fantasy nerds rave about. I find this entire genre perplexing and have held my nose up around those who enjoy this sort of thing.King seems to just be warming up in this brief novel (and at 8 books and counting, he certainly was just getting started) about The Gunslinger and his quest to capture ""the man in black."" As I sort of figured I would, I enjoyed the opening salvo, an ode to westerns. The further the book got the more the narrative turned to talk of wizards and fate and Fate. If this were anyone other than an already highly regarded author such as King, I would no doubt have been rolling my eyes in parts. Some scenes were rather memorable and exciting and I loved the paintings included. I look forward to reading book two with equal parts excitement and trepidation."
5,i don't know,I had a hard time liking roland because he let the boy die but was happy that he saved the boy in the drawing of the three
2,Cup of tea...,"I have tried for a long time to like Stephen King... starting quite a few books (simply because all my friends read him) and seldom finishing them. This was no exception. I guess this simply isn't my cup-of-tea style of book, although I assume he is a good writer."
5,the best of the series,"I had never read a stephen king book when i first read this, 10 years ago, and i was certainly skeptical. Long story short, I was blown away by the style and how captivating the story and characters were. The world's concept alone is mind blowing: wild west meets post-apocalyptic meets King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table meets the Wizard of Oz. It's crazy stuff.This is a truly great story and, in my opinion, the best book in the series."
3,Intriguing...,"The first part of the part was strange and a bit confusing. Perhaps that was the point. The second part of the book picked up the pace. Jake was a memorable character and the choice of the gunslinger with regards to Jake broke my heart. The meeting with the man in black was a bit anti-climatic. However, by the end of the book, I liked the gunslinger, even with his terrible flaws. I will continue with this highly acclaimed series."
4,Don't read this book and give up on the series!,"I read this after a friend read it and loved it. I read it and thought it was mediocre at best. However, I refused to give up on the series and possibly miss out on a great saga, and I am very glad I didn't. After I read part II: The Drawing of the Three, I came to appreciate this book for what it is; a prologue of sorts, much like ""The Hobbit"" in the LoTR Trilogy. This book introduces you to Roland, and starts his massive quest for the Dark Tower.Each book in the series leave enough questions to keep you reading the series and wanting to understand everything. As the saga progresses, everything starts to add up and connect. That said, judging the series on a single one of the books would be a crime. I loved this, though it isn't his usual captivating horror. A masterpiece."
4,A biginnig of great siries,"When you will read this book you won't understand a lot of things (where, when). but dont afraid to waste time this book is so intresting and beutifly written that you will find yourself buying the following books in this siries.in them you will discover a holl new world that will follow you in your dreams. King succeded to make a wonderful mix of fantasy humor action and science fiction that I never met in any book. (I gave this book only 4 points comparing to the others in this series, atherwise it worse 5)"
5,A fantatick read for people whom are willing.,"the four books in the dark tour seares will slowly pull you in. you will become a companin of Roland, the most intregueing chaireator that king has yet to create. it is a vertuial gumbo of steven kings books draging you through time space and Dimension. remember it starts slow dont just stop at the first book you wont be disapointed."
2,"Confusing, not his best","While reading this book I kept having to go back a few pages to an entire chapter to see if I missed something. The story jumps around in such a way that it is difficult and sometimes impossible to figure out what has happened.The parts of the story I understood I liked, not loved. Apparently this book took some 13 years to write, and I think part of my problem following it was when the writer would set it down for a year or two then pick it up and start writing in a different way with a different idea of who the character was supposed to be. I could be wrong but that was the idea I got from reading this book.I heard my friend raving about how great this series is, I picked it up to see what she was talking about. After reading it front to back (and several chapters two or three times) I still have no idea what the fuss is about."
3,Hard to rate,"This one was hard to rate. It's a very strange book. There is some fantastic characterization, as always with King, but then again the story barely makes sense at times. One thing I didn't like was the ""fated"" feel of everyone in the story. It damaged my suspension of disbelief, as I felt the author was so clearly making everything up and shaping it so things had to go his exact way. In short, there is some fantastically good imagery, and some might love it, but I didn't get drawn into the story because I found people to surreal."
3,Worth Reading to get to the Others,"This was one of Stephen King's earliest attempts at writing a novel, and it kind of shows. It's slow at times. A little grey. There are some great action scenes, but mostly you end up not caring much about the main character and not understanding the world that he lives in.However, the very next entry ""Drawing of the Three"" is one of the best in the series, and The Gunslinger is required reading to understand it. It's worth getting through the 220 or so pages to get to the other books in the series. And the Gunslinger isn't completely unenjoyable. It just doesn't live up to the rest of the series or the greater story of the Roland's quest for the mysterious Dark Tower."
4,well written!,The Gunslinger is a well written book by stephen king. I look forward to reading the rest of the books in the Dark Tower series.
4,Not the best Sci-Fi/Fantasy but very good it is,"This Serie Is excellent, it provides a very easy entry into fantasy/sci-fi. altough it's always hard to understand in the beginning (all the parts of the serie I mean) all books get more interesting towards the end. It's like you get sucked in, and the best of King's trademarks, creating a whole imaginative world with words, is optimal in these books. ""just""four stars, because of the hard start, for the rest it's very recommendable."
5,Modern Magica Realism,"This is a fun frolic into the early dream world of Stephen King. It's magical realism says that anything can happen in this book, that nothing is taken for granted, and for that reason the reader is absorbed. This writing approach reminds this reader of ""The Morning Tree,"" by Austin Reams.The Morning Tree""The Gunslinger"" is clearly King's first books because the plot appears to be created from moment to moment. There is no distinct end: rather each chapter seems to stand on its own as a short story, which is not a detraction. The subsequent books in this series are reportedly more developed. This reader looks forward to them all."
5,wow,"I'd always wanted to read some Stephen King, but I scare far too easily. A friend suggested this, and I was instantly hooked! I'm not usually a fast reader, but I finished this in one weekend...One of my fav's now!"
5,excellent,"this is Stephen King at his darn best!with this book, he has created a magical world. i only hope he can finish it before leaving this planet. at the pace he is going, it doesnt look pretty for us Gunslinger fans."
3,What . . . . happened?,"What a strange little book. The entire series is weird, but this one is just ... plain ... strange. That's not to say it's not good ... in a strange sort of way. You should read it first, just to get the feel for how strange some of the much longer (and better) books later in the series can get, but this is the poorest of the four out so far. I finished this irritated by the gunslinger (although he hadn't reached the heights of irritatingness he would reach in Part IV) and his little friend, Jake. I don't know why I'm recommending this, but I am. Strange."
5,very good,"Stephen King added a new twist to his writing humor. This book is a solidly good from start to finish. As they say a ""must read""."
3,"A little boring, but necessary","I'm about halfway through the Dark Tower series after trying years ago and never getting into this book. The Gunslinger is a little boring, but is necessary to understanding the other books in the series. The rest of the series is worth it, so keep going and finish this one, even if it is weaker than the others."
2,Convoluted language,"The story jumps around a lot with little in terms of segues. It was tricky at times to even figure out what was going on. I suppose I expected more from the book he allegedly considers to be his magnum opus. I really wanted to enjoy this book, but I had no idea what was going on."
5,Epic begining,"So for years I have heard about this series and wondered if it was really as good as everyone has said. After a brief pause from reading, I finally got the reading bug again and decided I had to give it a try. At first I started reading this knowing full well it was all lead in and it might be slow, but in one sitting I had already finished 100 pages. Still I was unsure if I liked it but as days went by I found that I couldn't stop thinking about this book. I had to know what was going to happen next and I had so many questions that it drew me in every time I picked it up. Stephen King did such a great job with this first book, that even though it is setting the stage for what is yet to come, and it posses more questions than it answers. I was so entertained with each new section that I can't wait to get the second to continue with Roland on his quest for the Dark Tower."
2,"Boring, But You Must Read This Series","The first book in the Dark Tower Saga is definetly slow. It took me a long time to even get myself to read the book. I have to say, don't judge the series by this one book. You have to invest some to get the true value of this series. To this book I have 2 Stars, but the series deserves a 5. Give the series a chance, this first book is really short, and the second one really gets the ball rolling. I know it's asking a lot, but it is well worth it."
4,It was good.,It very much had the feel of a beginning to a long saga. Some parts were faster than others. I'm heading for the next one.
4,Mixed Feelings,"I've read the whole series, and honestly that is the only way that this book can be appreciated. When spoken of in the context of the series it is a magnificent piece of work that leads your mind into realms of thought that you never knew existed. However, when it is looked at as a single book it is fairly weak. It ends with only a hint of closure that the dark man was found. As another reviewer has stated this easily could have been merely added onto the second part of the series (The Drawing of the three), and then it would have bolstered the strength of both stories. My four stars are generous when they rate just this book, but when used as a rating for what it fortells of what is to come, it is a pitiful grading scale because mere stars cannot define its impact."
3,Not as good as it could be,"I admire Stephen King tremendously for his writing skill, but I thought ""The Gunslinger"" was something of a disappointment. It's a lot shorter than his other books (it only took me 4 days), but that may be a good thing in this case, since the story seems to wander with no purpose. There are veiled references to some things in Roland's past, but hardly anything is revealed. There are several mentions of the Tower, but nothing is explained until almost the end, and even then it's vague and doesn't fill out the story nearly as well as I expected. I just picked up the second installment of the story, and I've heard it's a lot better. I hope so."
3,Typical stephen king,"If you like Stephen King's other books then you will probably like this one. It is dark, sinister, and yet compelling in the fact that you want to know what happens next. He's a writer who can hook you in at the very get go and keep you guessing the entire book. You have to read it for yourself in order to know what I am talking about - but I doubt you'll be disappointed..."
3,not one of his best,"Not one of his best, I'm not sure if I'll read any more in this series. I guess it could get better, but not sure I want to invest in them. usually his books start off with cant put it down stuff."
2,Stephen King disappoints for the first time,"Considering how many novels I've read by Stephen King, and considering that he is my favorite author, I am devastated that this book disappointed me SO much! Some of King's earlier works are not among his highest rated works (according to me) but this book is lower than all of them. For the first time I had to force myself to keep reading this book through to the finish because I simply could not get to any excitement. Ever. True this book may simply serve as an introduction to King's ""magnum opus"", but to save his readers from allowing the tragic dismay at the lack of excitement and unfulfilling plot from dissuading them to continue on with the series, this book ought to be combined with the second. After all, this book left me feeling like I had wasted $9.00 on what I thought would be a sure bet. I'm sure that I will continue on to ""The Drawing of the Three"", but I will not be buying it."
2,"Confusing, long, and dry","I understand that this book is just the first in a large series but there were so many loose ends that the novel was rather confusing throughout the story, even in the end. None of the characters aside from the main two hang around long enough for you to become attached to them. Compared to other Stephen King books that I have read, this was definitely on the lower end. Many of the characters in the story were also rather disappointing. Most characters hardly stick around for more than a couple chapters, and others are simply memories of the main characters. In a story with very little background, this just adds to the complexity of the story. I am giving the second book a chance now just to see what the hype is all about but I would recommend just picking up one of his many other novels instead."
2,It was horrible for me,"I know this is a stephen king book and I loved other books by him but still, i just couldn't read this one.It was boring. It put me in a dark mood. I could hardly care what came next. All the dust and the heat and the general background in the book made me want to wash myselft.In short, I tried twice but couldn't get past twenty or thirty pages into the book.I'm not sure what other people would learn from this review but anyway, this is it.I can only recommend people read the start of the book before buying it."
3,The Beginning,"Here is where it all starts. The gunslinger, with his donkey.This book, for me personally took two times to get through completely. The second time I attempted this book, it was a lot easier. I think that the last half of this book was a lot easier, and better paced that the first half. Roland is hard character to get to know, but once you understand him, he haughts you and you can't forget him.the character Jake is well-written and hard to forget. The man in black is an easily erasable, no-big-deal character. There are some things in this book that seem like ""not a big deal"" at the time, but are kind of a big deal. As, always, a well-written novel."
2,meh,"I'm really trying to like this story, but it's just not keeping my attention. Usually I enjoy a Stephen King book, but this one really just sucks. I don't understand the hype behind the Dark Tower. It was going to be my first e-book, but my sister talked me into The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, which despite the popularity was a fantastic book, the 3rd installment of the series was getting a little stale, but 1 and 2 were great. I stopped reading The Gunslinger and am now quite happy reading World War Z, I started it yesterday and can't put it down."
1,I threw it in the garbage,"the gunslinger is so painfully boring that not only did i stop reading it half way through, i also pitched it into the garbage can...don't waste your time or money."
1,One of Stephen King's Worst Books,I didn't like this book. It seemed to be a story about nothing. What more is there to say?
1,Not one of King's best,"The Gunslinger never drew me in like some of King's other novels. The characters are too shallow for one thing. The story seems to just drag on un-necessarily as well, which is pretty bad considering it is a fairly short read to begin with.I might read the rest of the series eventually, but for now I'm in no hurry to be disappointed further, by such a great author."
5,Amazing,"I read all books in this series and I was disappointed with the ending. To be fair, I think it's because I had unreal expectations. Up until the last book this series was my favorite (above The Lord of the Rings and the Ender's Game series). The only problem I had was his last book, but only because of how great the six books preceding the finale are. King does a great job of character development throughout the whole series and in some of the gunfights it really feels like you're there along with the characters pulling the trigger. Despite the last book I love this series and recommend it to anyone who asks about it."
3,just wasn't for me,"I have friends who absolutely loved the whole series, others who were so-so, but got caught up in it. It didn't grab me enough to commit to all 7, so i stopped here. Just not my thing i guess."
5,Greatest Story ever told,"The Gunslinger is the beginning book in the Dark Tower series, in my opinion, the greatest story ever told. The narration adds even more character and imagery to an already awesome tale of a strange character in a strange land on a quest that ulimately speaks to the largest unanswered questions we all have.Enjoy the listen."
4,Good introduction to a series,"This book was a very decent introduction to a cool series. It wasn't one of my favorite King books, but as far as world-building goes, it really hit the spot."
3,"Good begining, Good ending, Sleepy middle","I first read this book in 1999, before I really did much writing of my own. I loved King at the time, but didn't find this one good enough to hook me into the series. As I wrote more and people found out my genres, more and more people said, ""You got to read this series."" So, I picked it up again a couple of months ago. I was sucked in by the main character's visit to the town, which was early on in the book. Then I grew quite bored and found myself going off in my head as I moved through the pages. It wasn't until the very end that it became interesting again. So I've started book two and am over half way through. So far, it seems much better. But we'll get back to that later."
5,Tight and enticing,"I loved this short book. It really fired me up to read the rest of the series. It's deceptively simple but the image or the man in black being pursued by the gunslinger is a potent one. It works! The rest of the Dark Tower series follow on of course and are, collectively, one of King's finest achievements."
5,A Great Work And Introduction Into the DT Realm...,"This book is often underrated as the bad egg of the Dark Tower series, but it is probably the best introduction one can imagine into a world so unlike (and at the same time eerily similar) our own.It is very apparent in this book that Stephen King had no idea what would become of the series, especially after you've read the later DT books, but it is still masterful. The storyline is straightforward and the characters are defined. Even Sheb, the pianist who briefly comes into the story, is memorable.The whole book has an underlying sense of this: The Gunslinger good, Man In Black bad. Don't mistake it as simple, however, as it is not. The Gunslinger may be good, but he is not perfect. He betrays his young friend, Jake, and allows him to fall to his death. Jake's last words ""Go then, there are other worlds than these."" still remain rooted in me as memorable.This book is truly a masterpiece. Read it, then the rest of the series."
5,Start of an Epic,This amazing story starts out with the Gunslinger chasing the man in black in a world that has moved on. The book is just great. It entraps you in the gunslinger's world and makes it where you don't want to leave. This book is loaded with lots of action and it is very exciting. The world seems like the Spaggitti westerns with Clint Eastwood and that is a good thing. The gunslinger is just an amazing character that just simply cant be beat. I believe this book is for anyone but if you read this one you will want to read the others.
3,Another eye opener.........,"A good sequel to The Wall Street jungle, but probably not necessary once you have the picture that it's a rigged game."
1,Not a good read,I don't know what book these other people were reading buy I don't get it. This thing goes through some long history about the author and a senator. The print is hard to see and the charts are worthless. The author is in an era when tape reading was the latest thing. Save your money and buy something else.
3,Not too bad.,"Pretty good early 70's Swedish film. Didn't end how I thought it would, but not a bad movie. Oh...and I LOVED the hot scene near the end!"
4,The Other Side of the Story,"The majority of books about war and military fighting gloss over or ignore the troops and their emotions and reactions. For example both Eisenhower and Bradly gloss over the military debacle of WWII, the extended battle in the horror of the Hurtgen Forest in late 1944. The terrain there was (and is) incredibly difficult. This battle, fought for no good reason, seriously drained the fighting strength of the American Army and set up the scenario for the Battle of the Bulge. Regan covers this battle among others in a short but vivid manner. Afterall, this battle was the cause of the only GI executation of WWII, that of Pvt Eddie Slovik. Charles Whiting, in his book, ""The Battle of the Hurtgen Forest"" goes into greater detail but Regan does an adequate job capsulizing the battle in just twelve pages. Regan's review of other battles are equally well done and thought provoking. For the budding military historian, this book should be on the ""must read"" and own list."
3,"Interesting, yet fails to provide insight.","This book is interesting in that it can teach a new reader a few points on how to motivate soldiers to go beyond what's expected of them: yet ultimatly it fails to educate. Everything that Regan infers is logical to anyone who undersatand human behavior. Ultimatley, the book fails to provide any insight into the reasoning behind certain actions taken by soldiers. Mr. Regan fails because his inferences are basic and expected. This is a fun book in that it is interesting to a reader who only seeks a few good stories; but if a reader seeks to learn the motivation behind exceptional soldiers who are ready to sacrifice everthing for country, I suggest you look elsewhere. This book is light reading for an uninquisative mind."
1,Dissappointed!!!!!,For the price of this I thought this would give some backround on some of the birds in my area...but didn't find any....the pics are somewhat ok. Would not recommend this. Was very disappointed.
3,3,"Ich m√∂chte ganz neue deutsche Disco Fox Songs: Suche ausserdem die Songs: Weil ich dich liebe, Die Manage ist leer, Nicht ein Wort davon ist wahr,Gib mein Herz zur√ºck, Du und die das geht nie,Mitten in der Nacht"
1,A small problem,The problem here is that there is absolutely *no evidence at all* beyond hearsay that any of these supposed entities actually exist. We can all perhaps look forward to the next edition when the author might put forward hardcore proof of the existence of these beings. A Nobel prize might be in the offing!
1,Disappointing,"I disliked this book immensely - the research was poor, the exercises were contrived, and the author does not appear to have an understanding of what he is writing about. What a waste of money!"
1,Disappointing :o( Contrived,"Not up to par with Animal Speak. This ""Faerie"" book seems contrived & cranked up as propaganda to put the Fae of many cultures, as well as the Elementals of Nature under an artificial construct of male rule. It seems someone's ego got away with them here. It is not really about what the title suggests. Very misleading.If you believe the realms of the Fae & the powers & beauty of nature should be modeled after ""man's kingdoms"" & ""societies"", instead of the other way around, go for it. Otherwise you will be as disappointed as many, by a closer insight into the mindset of a modern male author, you hoped would do better. I'm very sorry to say I can not recommend this book. In fact IMHO it is a heartbreaking attempt to usurp the Fae, for misguided use."
1,Disappointing...,"I was used to Ted Andrews writing in a style that was methodical, approachable, accurate, and mystical. Unfortunately, I do not think he is well acquainted with this subject, and I don't think he is comfortable with working with the Fey. I hold nothing against him--the rest of the works I have read which he authored are very well done. However, I would not recommend his foray into the Faery realms. I believe he needs to do some more work if he truly wants to improve this work. I would encourage him to take some time, meditate, learn, and put out a revised edition of this book at some time in the future."
3,Good information,"I picked this book up when I was given the Unicorn book by the Ted Andrews, and it was interesting so I thought I would take a look at this one.It has very detailed descriptions in it but all of the pictures are black and white, which was kind of disappointing. I think this is a good book for doing research on the subject in that it is very descriptive and provides some of the author's own experiences as a guide to be followed, which are very dramatic.There is a meditiation exercise which is begun to be used halfway through which is very redundant and mediocre. I would have rated this one higher only if the pictures had been in color and maybe had more of them because then it would make it more artful and a nice coffee table type book to have laying around, but that and the nature of the exercise were what made it seem like not too bad but not great either. Maybe this would be better if revised with more exercises added, more pictures and more art."
4,Excellent info!!!,"I only had two problems with this book: 1. The pictures were black and white 2. The author really seemed to think that there was much spiritual gratification that comes from reading fairy tales. If you think so, this book is for you. Otherwise, just skip over those parts, because the book was still a very comprehensive resource on info on all types of faeries and elementals"
1,Don't Bother,"This is just another example of someone with his finger in too many new age pies. His books have been about so many different topics, he can't write one that is clear, well thought, and well researched.I'll admit, there are some good points and ideas here. I just didn't feel that this book was believable. I wouldn't recommend it for beginners in the craft.Go for Aoumiel's Green Witchcraft series, or Edain McCoy's A Witch's Guide to Fairy Folk instead."
5,Fairies are no longer just Astral Beings!,"In this book the author brings the Fairy Realms to life. He explains and shows you how to get in contact with them in the here and now in tangible reality. You don't have to learn how to astral project in order to experience them, they exist among us all the time. Funny experience: Woke up one morning and the dishes were clean in the dish washer when the night before they were dirty. My wife and I examined them and were left scratching our heads. I said maybe it was the fairies. She laughed and scoffed at the idea. She opened the refrig and pulled a new bottle of soda out and when she opened it it exploded all over her. No the bottle was not shaken up. I laughed and told her not to scuff the little people. This book is a definate worth read."
4,Hard to Resist,"This isn't quite in my Top 4 Heyer's, but it's a very near squeeze-out. Even if Pen and Sir Richard weren't a most entertaining couple, the hilariously incomprehensible speeches of Jimmy Yarde would themselves be sufficient to earn this a place of honor in anyone's bookshelf!"
4,A Romp through the English countryside,"A deceptive start to this book leads one to first believe that it will be yet another book about females masquerading as men.Georgette Heyer gives this old plot her own inimitable spin as she turns this into a wild romp through the countryside - with people after both the Hero and Heroine (often for the same reasons).Lots of fun, and lots of romance make this a great read."
2,not her best,"Bit repetitive. I got really tired of worrying about folks cravats, as I might have if I'd lived then. Nonetheless she writes better than most contempory regency genre."
4,Light hearted fun,"Georgette Heyer was extremely fond of the lethargic, intelligent, sarcastic male character; it was inevitable that she will make such one into a hero in one of her novels. Both the hero and the heroine are extremely appealing characters; the plot is rather simplistic for a Heyer novel (even for her romance), but the characterization of the hero (see above) and of Penelope more than make up for it. Penelope is indeed one of my favorite Heyer females; she is intelligent, charming and innocent, and is believably appealing for such a character as the hero to be (finally) a woman whom he can fall in love with. A gender switch confusion adds to the fun (though it's not made too much of). Strongly recommended."
4,A screwball comedy with rather too many coincidences,"Sir Richard is the titular hero, a wealthy, handsome man who is being pestered to marry and keep his noble bloodline going. His short-sighted family is pushing him at a cold-blooded woman whose family is floundering in debt. Feeling trapped, he encounters a lively young lady who, also feeling pressured to wed (her cousin, who looks like a fish) has taken matters into her own hands, dressed as a boy, and intends to run off to a childhood playmate. Sir Richard decides to accompany her on her expedition, and they have a series of adventures that somewhat strains credulity. Although it is easy to see what each sees in the other, there is not actually any romantic zing; rather, there is a great deal of charm and humor. I don't consider this one of the best of Heyer's books, but it is a very good read."
5,A quality product at good price and free shipping,"If you do some research, you'll find that not all Oil Filters are created equal. Some popular filters commonly sold at many places and highly advertised are not the best according to many tests. Purolator Oil Filters have consistently rated among the best in the industry and cost just about the same as the filters found at walmart, checkers, auto zone, etc."
3,Caution This is the 3W Unit!,"There are several lights on Amazon and those listed as 3W can be found cheaper. I suspected that a 3W light would be too weak so I found one that did not have 3W in the title. Ended up paying more for what was ultimately less :( The unit did connect to my HDR-XR550V easily and locks securely into place. Although the ""auto"" does work as designed it appears as though there is no ""auto"" off as quick when back to sufficient light levels. The manual says it will take up to 5 minutes to recognize sufficient lighting to shut off; thus, sucking camera power while on unnecessarily. The only way to seemingly shut if off sooner following low light conditions that has triggered ""auto"" is to physically power down the camera. Not what I was expecting, but at least I have light...I guess."
4,Great buy,"The product is easy to use, adds distance to the Sony Nightshot & Nightshot Plus modes of my camera. I did not notice a significant battery drain while using the light."
5,"One light, two jobs.",This light is great! I keep it mounted on my video camera and I never miss a shot due to low light. The light really improves indoor shots. The IR light is an added bonus for capturing night shots that the built in IR just can't reach.
3,Good Video Light but very pricey,"Im using this HVL HIRL video light with a Sony HC7. Nightshots do get enhanced brightness (though not very much brighter that the unaided HC7 nightshot capability). Having said that, I must admit that it illuminates a roughly 3 ft (1m) circle more of the surroundings than with an unaided HC7. The visible range video light is not any brighter than a fairly powerful spot light which one can get in Radio Shack / Auto parts retailers.So all in all, its a good compact video light but I'd not want to pay anything more than 30-35$ (I shelled out $75+ since I had no clue of how useful it actually is). So my advice, just dont buy unless its below $35."
2,OPE or Advertising media,"Ordered this magazine in July 2006 based upon the description. Got my 1st issue, Sep 06 in late Oct. Crammed with advertisments pertaing to help in running a business, no real article at all. Then it didn't come. I emailed Amazon in Nov, asking that I receive the missing issues, extend the subscription for the missing issues, or refund my money. Later I received a November 2005 issue and a Nov 2006 issue. I emailed Greenmedia about this and have yet to receive a reply. The two Nov issues I received are also packed with advertisments.Not much to read at all in the way of maintaing Outdoor Power Equipment. It does list page after page after page of business's that do though.In my opinion if you're looking for a publication that talks about small machines and the small engines that power them, avoid this this one !!!My 2 star rating is based entirely on the smooth paper and nice pictures."
5,2004: The Return Of Suffocation,"2004 so far has seen some of the biggest and most important names in metal come back including Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, and Slipknot. But no return came compare to the return of death metal greats Suffocation. Souls To Deny is their first new album in over 10 years. This album is so brutal, so piledriving, and so heavy from start to finish. Ever song is great. Frank Mullen's growls just grab you by the throat, while guitarist Terrance Hobbs just shreds and tears you to hundreds of pieces. Mike Smith is one of the best death metal drummers ever, man his work is just as brutal and fast as it was in the past. Suffocation Rules.A final few words to all the Anti-American losers out there:I'm an American Death Metal Fan, and I'm damn proud of it.AMERICA RULES, LOVE IT, OR LEAVE IT!"
3,OK for now,"Well Suffocation are back and haven't slowed down, even after the long hiatus. I must say though I thought their song writing abilities have suffered a bit. I think back to the complexities of Pierced from within and Effigy of the Forgotten and this album disappoints in that respect. The solos off those albums always blew me away. Usually jamming a million riffs into an album always threw me but Suffocation managed to pull it off. However that is my only complaint. The drums are solid and handled by the original drummer, vocals are sick as ever and the bass is solid. The production quailty is probably the best of all the suffocation albums and makes the music hammer you in the face. Any suffocation fan will want this one."
4,they're back,"they're stil good but i think the riff are not that original like in ""Effigy of the Forgotten"".Mike Smith beat the hell out of his drum, but i feel something is missing, that's not his style or he just try to make it different from his past work.the production is not as clear as Effigy (Scott Burns rules).but after all that, i give 4 stars because this album is enjoyable"
5,This band deserves every credit they get...,"Wow, one of the best bands in deathmetal history and i own all of their albums which i wasn't sure if i would be into suffocation's "" soul to deny"" but turns out that they still got it and still brutal as ever. Truly amazing production and not a bit dissapoint or weak or mediocre at all. Higly recommended."
5,The guys haven been back with a solid release album.,"Suffocation is a band that reigns high in the deathmetal world, for their brutal and crushing sound aswell as their sirious subjectmatters/lirycs. I know that when i got my hands on souls to deny, i knew that i woulnd be letdown at all. All the tracks are impressive and its so original which makes me even more happy. If you love pure deathmetal? Get it!!"
1,Cashed in the fags,I saw the Surgery impalement on MTV.com yeah YOU read right MTV my god how low has this band gone i`m so discuted i sold all their slow and boring albums f ck em what a embarressment to death metal.Yes people the truth hurts suffocation are now a wimpy MAINSTREAM band on MTV i wouldn`t be surprised if they wear skirs as well.People ditch these traders and stick with Cryptopsy LORD WORM has returned and their new album is gonna be a screamer.
5,Informative humor,"Doris North's natural humor comes through in flying colors in this book. If you know anything about the medical field, you'll enjoy the firsthand accounts of a woman in medicine at a time when there were few. Even if you're not in the medical field, you'll learn, laugh and grow to love Doris' book."
3,not what i asked for,I ordered jalapeno pepers and the supplier sent me chipotle... i love chipotle but that is not what i paid for...
2,"slow shipping and ""lacking"" a part","two main complaints1) it seems there is a hole in the rear ""cross"" bar of the boat for a ""sail"" or other vertical piece... but no item comes in the box and there is no piece to order (see the 26"" version for what the post/ sail should look like. This ""missing"" piece significantly reduces the beauty of the boat and therefore now looks like it has a missing piece2) the vendor eKitron was VERY slow in shipping... I paid the extra cost for expedited shipping (cost ~$25) and they still took 7 days to ship! (and never provided me with a tracking number). When I called to check on the status and ask for a tracking number, they only had an answering maching and did not return the message.Lacquer Sashimi Serving Boat 17 in."
5,Great strap,What can I say... I teach several Yoga classes a day and prefer the quality of the straps with the metal buckles.
3,Good product but don't like pre-seasoning,"I've been using cast iron griddles for decades. When we retired to the Philippines I gave away my old favorite to my son. Missing it I ordered a Lodge and had it shipped to the Philippines. The Lodge griddle is very well made, a good product but I don't like Lodge's slightly pebbled ""pre-seasoned"" finish. I am pretty expert at seasoning/maintaining cast iron cookware. A smooth finish on the surface of the griddle would make it easier to to establish the perfect seasoning that is the great pleasure of cast iron. The rough ""pre-seasoned"" finish the griddle comes with stands in the way of real natural cast iron seasoning."
4,grill'em,"Cast iron is great to cook just about everything, or to re-heat food specially pizza and tortillas. You get that restaurant look on pancakes and with bacon don't even mention it, just use a bacon press to get a nice result. When ever you wash any cast iron item just put it on the stove and flame dry it, to keep it from rusting. That works for me."
2,"12"" lodge pro logic square griddle","I really wanted a square skillet from Lodge for a long time. This one is highly disappointing. It sits flat on a surface when cool however, it warps as it gets hot and then flat again when cool. Not what any cook wants. The eggs run away from the uneven surface and bacon grease leaves the skillet entirely. Good luck with yours but I can't recommend this one."
1,heats unevenly,I am very disappointed with this pan. It heats unevenly. Making grilled sandwiches is difficult because you need to keep rotating the sandwich to get it completely grilled. Making pancakes is worse. The pancake only cooks in the center of the pan.
4,Sq Griddle,"Quite heavy and durable, cleans up quickly when hot. Great for grilled sandwiches or french toast.Turn down if gets too hot, cast iron retains heat easily."
1,WORST GRIDDLE EVER!!!,"If you want to make the worst pancakes ever, then buy this griddle. I have never seen a pancake that was burnt on one half and uncooked on the other half of the same side. I wanted to buy American, but this isn't the way to go. This was a waste of my money."
5,Pre seasoned,"Bought this to replace Teflon coated one. Nice heavy griddle. I use mostly cast iron and do not think it takes more time than any other pans to clean, you have to wash any of them."
2,Uneven heating,"I wanted to love this griddle because I have other Lodge pans and the size is great. That said, even with preheating, this griddle does not heat evenly - the center gets much hotter than the corner areas. For pancakes, I rotate them just to have some even browning. A disappointment."
1,very disappointed,"I'm trying to replace my teflon with other things, and have several other cast iron pans that I use and like. But this pan is awful. Heat distribution is VERY uneven, even after letting it heat up for a long time. The center burned, and the outside didn't cook, on high, on low,and forget about the corners ever cooking. And this is on the largest diameter gas burner on my stove. A waste of money."
5,The best pan in the world!,I was so excited when I got this Lodge pan and have used it almost every day since I got it. I heats more evenly than anything I have had in pans before (excepting my regular cast iron one which I also love).Got here in good shape and the price was great!
4,Back to Basics,"I purchased this item because I was so sick of buying nonstick products that only work for a short period of time. So I decided to go back to basics and get cast iron. Cast iron has proven the test of time. I agree with some of the other reviews, that this particular item does not heat evenly. The corners do not get hot enough. However, I am going to keep the pan because I don't have the health concerns with cast iron as I do with the nonstick pans."
2,Not that great.,I have been looking for this pan for years.I was so happy to find them I bought two.I wish I had not bought them.Hot spots and surface is sooo ruff.
2,Nice idea but...........,"I thought this pillow would be the answer! Its a great idea but one insert is to flat, two inserts is ok, all three memory foam inserts are way to much. And pillow ear? Oh my aching ears, I have had pillow ear pain before but never like this. I am not sure my ears will ever be the same, and sadly, I probably have to stop using this pillow! It needs help :)"
4,Good smooth jazz!,This was bought to replace one that someone damaged. I had to have it. It's that good. 2 of the best trombonist around.
4,Good product.,"This works on par with mothers showtime spray lubricant and as final once over the car so it's perfect. Good for using as a pad lubricant when cutting, polishing, and waxing."
5,Handy little bottle!,"I have a very unique finish on the tins of one of my bikes; it's a triple plate gold with a clear coat finish and for six months I couldn't wax it, polish it or generally touch it. Even now I have to be very careful with the products that I use on it, but I've never had a problem with Meguiar's final inspection. In fact even when I wasn't allowed to wax the finish, I still could use FI 34 to remove dust from the bike. When I don't have time to wash, polish and detail the bike a quick squirt of this ingenious product and a wipe down with a MF cloth and I'm on my way. Bike looks new!It lasts and lasts too - although that could because I'm using it on a bike! Ultimately, always have a bottle of this in your garage regardless of your vehicle type."
5,Not just for cars!,This product was recommended by the store where I purchased my glossy black baby grand piano to use on the finish to keep it protected and glossy. Works like a charm!
5,A Public Relations Star is Born,I am an instructor at a large university and I teach public Relations on a frequent basis. This will be a requirement for the next class that I teach. A great book indeed!
2,Rehash of Rules We All Already Know. Save Your Time.,"The book was highly recommended by Blogger, radio talk show host, author HH, unfortunately I found it lacking. The book rehashes ten communications rules we have all heard before (use short sentences, stay on message and repeat, etc.) and it gives (glaringly obvious), examples of communication success stories ( e.g. ""plop, plop, fizz, fizz""....., and ""Just do it"", etc.).I'd say pass on this one.This is the first review i have ever written, this book was that disapointing."
1,Dollar Bookstore Find,"Luntz' Words That Work are words that mask the truth. Clear, concise messaging should assist a citizen's understanding of an issue. Clearly that is not Luntz' intent. Identifying and selecting words and phrases that listeners find most comfortable does not insure truth telling. Truth and accuracy should always be the goal."
4,Very useful.,"Very useful, Thanks Oscar K for suggesting this book.I like the DVD version also for use in my travel laptop."
4,"Favorite quote at home "" it's not what I said, but how I said it""","Mr. Luntz helps you understand that what you say is not always what people hear... Often because your first words have closed off the conversation being ""heard"", or has caused the listener to begin thinking about their counter argument without fully hearing all you have to say. This book helps you stop and think about what you want to say before you begin to try and say it."
3,Great title!,"There is nothing in this book with which I would disagree. However, that doesn't mean that it doesn't have it's problems. All of the other reviewers have pointed out many of it's fine assets. It would be helpful to someone just starting out in writing. But I was disappointed! From its title, not what you say, but what people hear, I was expecting it to explore that specific concept. The difference between the transmission of words and their reception. If it does, its buried in there somewhere. I was very excited by a book that had some fresh insight into language. My biggest gripe: now that someone has put a book out there that supposedly covers the subject, others will be disinclined to do so. A more honest, but not great title would be: Tips on 21st century writing. Parting shot: it does take forever to make rather simple and obvious point, which would be okay if it was about the subject which the title suggests."
3,SPIN RATHER THAN ELOQUENCE..,"Luntz re-packages material that's been around for a long time. There are no revelations in this book.I thought of Lincoln as I read this book. Lincoln certainly knew how to package his thoughts for common folk, and he wasnt condescending or patronizing with the words he used. Lincoln used timeless words that resonate with every Age. Luntz is no Lincoln."
2,Brevity as an Effective Communication Skill (would that it were!),"Mr. Luntz sites brevity as an effective communication skill, yet he goes on and on and on with his examples and repeats himself throughout the book.He uses the book as a vehicle to promote his Republican platforms, which is boring and annoying.He is a little impressed with himself and is not afraid to share that with the reader. An especially distasteful example of this is his self-serving introduction about performing for Democrats and celebrities at Ariana Huffington's home.He tries to imitate Steven Levitt's style of writing but he's just not that interesting or cool."
2,Words that Work,"Disappointing. Deceiving title. I purchased the audio version of this book on line simply based on the title. I thought I'd be getting a book to ""introduce"" me to some colorful and effective words. Big mistake! Too political! Had I known this, I would never have purchased the book."
2,Disappointing,"For someone extolling the virtues of word effectiveness it's shocking how many grammatical errors the author makes. While there are some fascinating aspects to the book the negative aspects outweighed the positive ones. I was also distracted by the author's arrogance and right-wing stance. The buzzwords made the book read like an ""infomercial."""
2,It works only if I an given a fansy speech.,"I need hard core stuff for the current work environment. I don't need to know how to deliver some fancy speech. This book was very disappointing to me, only because the author outlines non related issues that are not relative in the work place."
4,great words,"An informative book with ""great"" words. Pay attention - you'll start to hear and see these words everywhere."
3,A lie is worth a thousand pictures,"I give this book three stars because it is readable and transparent. But read it with care.He says credibility is important yet he lies on every page and argues in favor of lying, as long as you can get away with it. His subtitle is ""... it's what people hear."" Now I suppose he would claim that the phrase ""death tax"" is only a name and cannot be a lie, Yet when people hear ""death tax"" they surely hear ""tax one's heirs must pay"" and, indeed, the purpose of the phrase is to get them to think exactly that!In the section named ""credibility is as important as philosophy"" he repeats the lie about Gore inventing the internet with neither reference nor apology. There is no doubt that Luntz is a clever young man and is handy with words. He would have made a great insurance salesman. I am sorry that he did not settle for that."
2,"If you're not planning to write political speeches or ad copy, leave this one on the shelf","The jacket might play up helping you say the right things to get a promotion, get on a booked plan or get out of a ticket, but that advice takes up ten pages of the book, total.The rest might interest you if you want to know how to write a winning political speech or make people buy your company's product. Or, perhaps if you'd like to be beaten over the head with the history of successful ad campaigns and are fascinated by trivial knowledge about TV jingles. If you like rambling books that circle back to ""clever"" points made earlier, you'll love it.But if you were hoping the book might be relevant to your own life otherwise, you're SOL."
2,Freshman material,"I am always suspicious of people who insist on putting ""Doctor"" in front of their name. My suspicions proved true. this book is well suited for a high school or college 101 level communications class. It's all about superficial tricks with language. Perhaps George Orwell read a similar book before he wrote the famous ending to his work ""1984."" Luntz advocates using words that are appealing to the audience. When you read how they were applied in political campaigns you can see how we end up with the contentious Congress that we have today. If you buy it, get a cheap used copy."
4,In political context?,"It's not what you say, it's what they hear - it's an insightful perspective, and Frank Luntz have done a great job of illustrating his point through numerous in examples in 'Words that Work'. Not surprisingly, a lot of people interpret 'rhetoric', and the entire process of positioning a concept as manipulative, but let's face it, all of us have our biases and because of that, the choice of words matters.Frank Luntz offers some great examples of how language affects our interpretation and reactions. Likewise, he also offers some good advice on 'words that work' - imagine, efficient, etc. My only complaint is the lack of generalization of the concepts beyond the political (left) examples from Frank's own experience. All the same concepts apply to businesses, and our personal lives, but there is little to none discussion on either."
5,"If you want to communicate better, buy this book","Great book from a man who knows how to communicate. Don't let tags such as 'conservative' or 'Republican' prevent you from basic truths about communicating more effectively. Frank Luntz knows what most politicians, business people and marketers do not: It's not about them, it's about your audience. Or to put it more effectively, ""It's not what you say, it's what people hear.""If you want to become a better sales person, a better pastor, a better politician, a better leader, or a better communicator then buy this book. If you have the greatest idea in the world but can't tell people what it is, it's worthless. If you have a vision but can't get other people to follow, you will never lead.For me, this book boils down to one word: Results.Frank Luntz writes a great book to help anyone who wants to communicate better."
5,If words are important...,"If you place a high value on words, then Dr. Luntz's book is a must read. He analyzes everyday language and offers suggestions on how to sharpen and polish the words we use. ""It's not what you say, it's what people hear"" is an appropriate sub-title. This is worth the money you will pay!"
3,Uninteresting,"I thought the book with help me with my daily use of the language, but it was boring. I stopped reading it. I hope to come back to it"
1,Don't bother,"There are a few very interesting stories and some interesting comments. By and large, it is a ""7 Habits"" wanna-be and he spends way to much time talking about himself. A bit of common sense will cover the territory he tries to cover in this book.In the last section where he promises to tell you the words that work to get you through everyday things like traffic tickets, he basically says make up a good story and lie like a rug."
1,Waste of time,"This book should be titled ""Words That Work If You're Talking to Dumb Rednecks"". It's entire premise is to use small words and short sentences so the lowest common denominator of the population doesn't get confused by what you're saying. This book will appeal to the Jerry Springer crowd."
1,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in the book because the author didn't write what he purports to have written. This isn't a book about clear communications rather it is a primer on how to use language to manipulate your audience. It would be most applicable to people in advertising and politics especially the spin doctors (left, right or in the middle)."
1,Another Right Wing Spin,"Since the November 2006 mid-term elections, for the first time I actually enjoy listening to right-wing talk radio - Hannity, Limbaugh, Boortz (the Limbaugh wanna-be), Savage, etc. Why do I listen? I enjoy listening to them and their callers whine about their loss!!!Even here, in writing their reviews, the right-wingers are still in denial that the country has changed direction.However, I do recommend Frank Luntz's book to Progressives who want to gain a strategic insight into how the right wing operates."
1,Good to read if you want to induce a coma.,"I have a theory about people who rate products with one star--they are basically clueless whiners. So, when I read the one star reviews of Luntz's book, my first thought was that these were just some pedantic elites with sunburns on the inside of their nostrils. I'm going to have to change my theory because they were right.Most of the main ideas are fairly common knowledge. I thought Luntz would get into more of the psychology of his work, but he drones on with example after example after example. Frank, we got the point after the first example.Click on the Table of Contents, read that, and you will save yourself a few bucks."
3,Good insight,"A very interesting insight into verbal trickery and the assumed intellectual limitations of voters. For a scathing analysis of this trickery see youtube, The Daily Show/Frank Luntz."
1,But what if I hear this?,"But what I hear is a deeply mendacious piece of self-promotion, which speaks at length about the author's achievements in public life, but which cannot keep its own promises. The blurb claims that this text ""raises the curtain on the craft of effective language."" Yet this is not a book about effective language; rather it is about manipulation. It's not about getting your message across; it's about getting people to agree to a message that has been tailored to elicit that agreement, whatever its real content might turn out to be.If I'm wrong about this, then the author is by no means in control of his own message. If I'm right, then the author is by no means in control of his own message."
1,"Save your money, read Strunk and White instead","Aside from the personal anecdotes, there is little in this book that is original or frankly (no pun), all that helpful.For example, most of the points he includes in his chapter ""Ten Rules of Effective Language,"" are far more effectively (and wittily) presented in the old standby Strunk and White and like writing manuals.Most of the rest of this stuff can be picked up in your average self-help book or a marketing manual.And yes, I've heard Luntz on radio and seen him on TV. He comes across every bit as disingenuously as he does in writing."
2,"Too little insight, too annoying a voice","I had a terrible time listening to this ebook, as I found the voice most annoying.A certain amount of horn-blowing is expected from an author, especially one whose main field is advertising, but the amount of self-promotion in this book was really unacceptable, particularly in light of the minimal number of insights actually in the book.There are (unintentionally) humorous bits, though. As when the author spent several pages telling about the importance of brevity. :-)The book may be better than the audiobook - at least you won't have to listen to that voice."
2,Bad Reprint,"This is probably one of the best Plane Trigonometry books in existence, great explanations of proofs and a great way to see how they did trigonometry ""back in the day."" However, the quality of this reprint is bad. The size of the book is deceiving. When you open it up you have a little 5x3 inch square of writing in the middle of the page. There is about 3 inches of blank space on each side surrounding it. This may be good for notes but the text is really small and a pain to read, not to mention the text itself is light in some areas. I know I'm returning mine to get a better one."
4,New Orleans History.,"I love New Orleans, and I love historical novels, so this book was tailor-made for my tastes. I enjoyed the book. The heroine is wonderful, and her quest for her identity and her past is really gripping. It's a long book, but it doesn't seem so as you read through it. That's the test of a good book - can it take you out of yourself so you don't even realize what's going on? This one does that."
2,New Orleans Legacy,"This paperback was shipped quickly which was great. However, the condition of the book was much less than advertised----very yellowed, stiff pages; looked very old and not appealing to read."
4,mark twain sam australia WA Perth,"This movie was a lot better than I expected. Fabian Carillo is actually a decent actor as well as a martial artist. The fight scenes were very good but I felt while watching the film that it needed a little more spice; more action, suspense that sort of thing and that's the only reason why I rated this 4 stars.A decorated war hero and covert agent, Danny Silva returns home to East L.A abd finds his neighbeorhood has been taken over by a violent street gang that is headed by the brutally corrupt Bishop Thorn (Gary Busey). Danny must now take a stand; against all odds he wages a war with only his fists to return the streets to his people."
1,lame actioner with Busey and Lamas in horrible roles,"Lame action movie about a mexican karate guy who goes after a group of thugs called The Latin Dragon. He also has criminal Gary Busey (Lethal Weapon, The Lost Highway) and his bleach blonded badguy henchman Lorenzo Lamas (Renegade) on his case as well. Corny action scenes filled to the brim with lame dialouge. Could Lorenzo Lamas be anymore bad in this movie. Save your money and your time from seeing this crappy flick of stupid proporstions. Also starring Robert LaSardo (Tv's General Hospital, Blue Streak)"
4,Good Comfort Cooking,This book is a little different that most as the author's personality is intertwined in the recipes. Personally I enjoy it since I understand that when she says milk she means non-dairy and butter is actually margarine. I'm not the type to have a fit if a little interpretaion is needed. The recipes are good and I feel comfortable cooking with her style. Just go in knowing you might have to think but just a little.
1,A very biased author,"I couldn't make heads or tails of the previous review, so I clicked on the author's Amazon Page. I'll paste what the page says, but I take from it that Symonds not only explores but probably glorifies Michelangelo's alleged homosexuality.I don't care about Michelangelo's sex life. I do care whether a biographer presents an *objective* account of his subject's life.""John Addington Symonds (5 October 1840 - 19 April 1893) was an English poet and literary critic. Although he married and had a family, he was an early advocate of male love (homosexuality), which he believed could include pederastic as well as egalitarian relationships. He referred to it as l'amour de l'impossible (love of the impossible). A cultural historian, he was known for his work on the Renaissance, as well as numerous biographies about writers and artists. He also wrote much poetry inspired by his homosexual affairs."""
2,charger,"This charger seems to work when it wants to. It doesn't like to stay hooked up in the Zune and before I know it, my battery is almost dead. Other than that, it works great when it works."
2,Not a big fan - good price but for how long?,"I have gotten two of these. One after the first broke. Well, the second broke and not even from abusive activity. It just only had life of so many uses untl the wire weakened and failed. Shame. A little better quality would have everyone using these because of their good price and quick shipment."
5,Unique approach to SPC,"This book is great! Through numerous real-world examples, it takes high-level ideas and makes them understandable. I highly recommend this book for anyone using SPC."
3,The story is more exciting than the book,"Frank Donovan's 1969 rendition of one of the greatest adventures in American Navel history leaves something to be desired.The Story is direct. The USS Essex travels to the South sea's to raid the distant whaling grounds of England during the war of 1812. The book covers the situation leading to the decision, the trip around the horn, the dealings with the various governments there and the natives and its eventual end in battle.The best parts of the tale are the dealing with south sea natives, they tell an unknown story about diplomacy and force in an unfamilar culture some of who's lessions are useful today.The story suffers from the decision to cut off the story after the final battle not giving more conclusion of the characters in play except for the ESSEX itself.For those unfamilar with the tale it will be a good read, for all other the account is passable."
2,Not sturdy enough,"Maybe my kids were too young for these books, but they stopped working shortly after getting them because the tab that attaches the animal to the book to make the noises detached. In fact, two of the tabs were broken even before using them for the first time and I had to send for replacements. They are great books and the kids loved them while they worked, they just need to figure out a way to make them more durable."
1,Bad Don't BUY IT!!!,"not worth it i tell you, if you like the strokes music you will defiently not like these versions of them, mostly metal it is a very bad remake of is this it. don't waste your money people!! i made that mistake!"
2,Meh...,"OK, if you got it because you love The Strokes, it might not be the best thing to buy. I love The Strokes and I honestly didn't like the sound of most songs. But, I do admit, it is really cool way to listen to how a song can be reinterpreted musically."
3,"cute, but don't need that many at one time",I got them for a halloween party. Didn't really need 40 of them.They were easy to apply and easy to remove.
2,Surprise,"I was expecting a book, not a catalog. I didn't find this useful. That said, it's a very beautiful publication."
2,not inventive,"most of Waterworks shown in book are based on historic styles, somewhat modernized. I would call this a vanity book. Lots of text. And I would not give them the credit for Inventing a Bath Style."
1,Avoid,Extremely low quality. Bits perform like weak pot metal. Center holes are off-center. First three bits I tried broke on first use -- in each case when gently removing a steel self-tapping screw from plastic. Vendors should be ashamed to sell this junk.I replaced it withthis set from Klein; much better quality.
1,ok but bits very brittle,"The bits are ok but they are basicly one or 2 uses each. The spanners especially snap right off afrer removing a couple a security screws. Just realize that these are cheap for a reason, if you want a good set move up to the Klein bits"
4,"facil, practico y divertido!","I volunteer in an ESL program in AZ and have found this book very useful in several ways. The book is divided into topics (ie Finding a hotel, Let's order some food, etc.) and the vocabulary is often introduced in a short English story with 'difficult' words translated into Spanish below. As a non-Spanish speaker, this has helped me to be able to nod my head when students are discussing the meaning of a new English word amongst themselves. There are many pictures in the book to accompany new vocabulary. The majority of the exercises are done in English without translations provided. The directions, however, are given in Spanish. Although it is not a text we use in class, it has been helpful for creating additional activities and I would quickly recommend it to any student looking for support materials for independent practice."
4,Loses one star for some inaccuracy,"This book is gorgeous and informative, however there are a couple of mistakes i found in the Maori section: women's tattoos are on their chins, not cheeks, and ""mana"", meaning pride or esteem or honor, is misspelled as ""manu"", which means bird. Perhaps there are other mistakes in other sections which i don't know about, but these ones take off a star from what is otherwise a very lovely book."
4,KISHON,"Originally hesitated about buying the books because the deal looked too good. The seller properly identified the condition of the books and we were very satisfied with the transaction.Kishon is a quite humorous and this book is very good reading. Light, humerous, and entertaining."
3,hey there,what can I tell ya..one great book..I read too far afield before this one..different kind of book..yes..more complexed..but this one is a litle tiny book compering to too far afield...Local is more then anything It will truly crack u up kind of book..at the same time..hey..Grass makes u think of any other current writer as being a schmuk at leat in his writing history and analyzing branch..some less then 300 pages..this book is a straight kick in the stomach...leave u breathless and thinking...whats was that little lady's number?Nadine Gordimer...Who cares...Long Live Grass !
1,The does not provide insight into the subject of Control,"With the exception of one chapter, this book is about a narrow and unproven approach to control system design: The L1 theory. There is almost surely no real life plant that carries a controller based on this design. Additionally, the authors present a mathematical treatment of an engineering subject, but the treatment fails to give the experienced control engineer any insight.From the point of view of mathematical control theory, the book is simply a watered down version of a few topics in infinite dimensional optimization and functional analysis. It is based on an application of the Hahn Banach theorem to a formulation of the control problem. It also contains a lot of mathematical facts, but it does not tie them well to control theory. So the mathematician will get little insight into the subject of control.Here we have a book that is neither useful to the engineer, nor to the mathematician."

5,Jesse Winchester is the Greatest!,"If you aren't familiar with Jesse Winchester, this is the album to get. He is one of the best at fusing a variety of types of american music into hauntingly beautiful ballads. A true American Master."

4,The RamseyFMA200 5/8 Wave broadcast antenna is a good antenna. The only problem I had with the antenna was the tuning proceedure,"The only problem I had with the antenna was the tuning proceedure. If you're going to tuning down near the bottom of the FM band, (88.0 - 89.0), adjusting the movable upper element to the suggested length gets a little tight because the upper element is not long enough to be securly clamped to the lower element. I was not satisfied with it's tightness so I did use a little waterproof tape helping secure the two element a little better to each other. The Electrical connection is good regardless. Also the spacing on one group of set screws was off so only one screw could be used. The antenna lives up to it 3.4dB gain, it gets out there, even mounted only 15 in height."
1,Insult to injury,"Seriously? A freaking box that holds all the seasons together?! If I wanted to buy all the seasons again, I could buy them all individually! If you're going to cancel a show that was FINALLY starting to return to its former glory, atleast give the fans a little something to remember it by! I mean look at the complete series for LOST. They treated their fans with respect, and gave them something more than just a box containing all the seasons. Forget this. Let me know when you decide to do the complete series of Heroes right! Also, when you do, would you mind releasing it on Blu-Ray, and maybe a few extras?P.S. How about instead of wasting your time and money on that piece of **** Cape show, you put it into giving a good show proper closure...or atleast a proper box set."
1,Region 1 ??? Region Free ???,"Don't get me wrong, the Blu-rays play perfectly fine; and I love HEROES. I actually bought this set specifically for the Season 4 bonus disc; since I have the bonus discs for Seasons 1-3. Both my Blu-ray player AND PS3 spit the DVD back out stating a PAL disc/Region 2 could not be played; the listing and Blu-ray.com show the playback as 'region free'. This Amazon listing show it as 'region 1', the blu-rays are playable, but apparently NOT the DVD; so this review is towards the product for sale; not the content."
1,Danger! These can damage your ears!,"The built in radio is capable of creating 96 db of sound pressure at your ears if you are listening to a loud rock station. Anything above about 85 db for any extended time can cause damage. You may think you're protecting your hearing with these while operating loud machinery, but if you turn up the radio loud enough to hear it, you could be in danger."
5,AM/FM headphones,I use it tuned to my Sirius reciever to wear in and around the house.Picks up the signal well and is light and comfortable to wear with good noise cancelling.
4,Good isolation,These have very good noise isolation. Audio quality of headphones is adequate for my plans.
2,Not good reception of local radio stations,The receiver is weak and I have difficulty receiving very good reception from our local radio stations. I am not satisfied and would not recommend purchase of this item.They are comfortable to wear. That is the only favorable comment.
2,Digital Work Tunes not Durable,"I've purchased three sets of Digital Worktunes. I use them 1-2 days per week. One radio failed in less than a month and was replaced by the manufacturer. The other two failed in a little more than a year after they were out of warranty. I like them while they work, but can't help feeling cheated when they fail so quickly. I'd willingly pay more for a durable product."
2,Philco,"Ladies & Gentlemen, save your money and don't bother to buy these if you want reliability.Shortly after I purchased these, the electronics quit working. It was very static and would shut off for no reason. This situation got very frequent over two weeks and finally quit working totally. All functions were affected: am/fm radio and the input jack. The batteries were not the problem. Also cheap flexable plastic battery door that broke completely off because of cool weather making it stiff.I finally had to toss them in the trash can because was totally unuseable. I gave them 2 stars because they do block sound very well and fit your head comfortably."
4,Great for PodCasts,"As hearing protection, like other Peltor products, it is great. The tuner and the audio quality are ok, but nothing to brag about. The sound is a bit shallow. However, where this product shines is simple ability to accept an audio input such as from an Apple iPod. I listen to podcasts and during my lawn work and am very thankful to be able hear the audio over the sound of my mower. I love this product, but the average audio quality won't get it 5 stars. Still, it is good enough that I will not mow without them."
2,Disappointed with reception and durability,"I have used my headset almost daily for a year and would gladly welcome a better product with the same features. The reception is poor compared to any other radio I use. It's fine for strong stations but cannot pull in others that I routinely listen to.Then, in the 13th month the stereo started to cut out intermittently (the non-radio side has no sound). The company offers a 12 month warranty and their rep declined to extend the warranty, which I find discouraging.I'd like to see a quality product offered by another company. It appears to be a very simple feature set.Update: After paying for a repair to restore stereo to the headset the on/off switch appears to have failed after about 18 months of use. So now I have hearing protection without any audio. I am waiting to see if the manuf. will help me this time and would be happy to update this review again if the situation improves. But I still say that there is room for a more durable product here."
5,One Happy Daddy,"My kids and I purchased these headphones for my husband for Father's Day. He had headphones for decreasing the noise of the tractor while he mowed the lawn, but he found it quite boring--it takes over an hour to mow our lawn. Now he doesn't mind mowing the lawn as he jams out to the tunes that play on the radio. These Peltors get great reception and they block out a good deal of the noise from our tractor. My husband said, ""This is the best Father's Day present ever!"" :)"
1,RETURNED,"The performance of this radio was totally unsatisfactory. I returned it. Could tune in very few stations and it would not hold those. In these days of electronic ""miricles"" this radio was a joke. I ordered a better one in the fiftys with Bazoka comics. ABS"
3,Rethiking really made me rethink!,"Very intresting, eye opening concepts in this book help to explain some of the disconnect I have been feeling in ""church"". Very helpful in gaining a better perspective. What to do after you read this book will be the bigger question."
4,Great Review of Biblical Church Planting,"Great review on the growth of the early church, particularly from Acts, and the approaches used by Paul, Peter, Silas, Barnabas, etc... Viola examines the common practices of the early church meetings, meals, meeting places, and leadership. Provides an in-depth examination of the church model that changed the known world at the time."
3,"Not as Good as ""Pagan Christianity""","OK, I'll probably catch a lot of flak for this, but I just wasn't that captivated by this book. I am in agreement with most of what Frank says, but I had a hard time getting through this book -- to me it just seemed to ramble and wander a lot. Now, I *did* read Pagan Christianity first, and it is a first-rate book -- maybe that is why I was disappointed in this one, as it is actually the first volume of the trilogy."
2,"Great to see there's a problem in Christianity, has other issues that detract from the issue at hand","I think Frank may be borrowing heavily from a truly groundbreaking work calledThe Normal Christian Church Lifeby Watchman Nee. He also references two other books by Mr. Nee -The Body of Christ, 10 packandThe Glorious Church. Unlike Frank, Mr. Nee is known to be very humble, not self promoting, and he actually died after about 20 years in a prison in China which he had the option of leaving before the Communists took over.As King Solomon said, there is nothing new under the sun, including in Christianity. The Bible includes everything, we just need to really get into the revelation of everything that is in it and live it in our daily life. So, what is groundbreaking aboutThe Normal Christian Church Lifefor me is how the recovery of truths in the Bible it contains are unveiled and presented for living a normal Christian life."
1,Cute story but....,"the woman needs an editor who knows basic English grammar and punctuation. I'm not a stickler online, but in a published novel? The three errors on the second page alone were so distracting that I almost gave up.The young man who's been suspended from school for his computer hi-jinks and his holographic adventures with two older gentlemen are fresh and welcome additions to the salt-of-the-earth-folks-in-a-quaint-small-town genre. I hope that the author rounds out her main characters a bit more in future installments, because they have potential."
1,A Miracle for St. Cecilia's is no miracle of a book,"Okay, maybe it doesn't deserve a 1 star, maybe a two, but only for effort. The author is trying so hard but falls so short of being an interesting book. An avid reader of Jan Karon's 'At Home in Mitford' series, I had high hopes for this book. But it is so heavy handed with the religion that it is very uninteresting, and this from a very religious fellow. The writing isn't fluid but stilted and weak. I kept trying to like it but just couldn't."
4,fun reading,"Having lived in the Litchfield, CT area for 35 years, I especially enjoyed the descriptions of the locations in the book. Characters are believable and certainly all things happen for a reason---not always easy for us to see. Enjoyable reading."
2,Not so sure if I would recommend...,I ordered this book for my stepdaughter and opened it to find subject matter regarding the pleasures of masturbation and how to shave pubic hair. I would have liked to have known this before purchasing the book. No where does it say that these topics are covered. The book is supposed to be about journaling ideas for young women not lessons on the birds and bees.
4,Judgement Time,"Love this game. Best Dredd game to date. Bought it after watching the new movie, which was surprisingly good, and brought back memories of playing this. Great buy."
3,Mindless Shooter,"All you do in this game is shoot everything and everyone. There is not much of a reason to do anything except kill every chance you get, and the Sega Genesis game was done much better."
5,durable toys,"The Schleich models seem to make much more sense to me for younger children. They are less expensive and much more durable than the Breyer models. And, they are cute and fully acceptable to my grandaughter who loves all things horses including the fantasy variety. The knights and such do not interest her, but they look like they would be a fun set for a boy. Educational? Perhaps, as in the sense that she knows now what a pegasus and a unicorn are. She gets a great deal of fun from them."
2,"Nice toy, s-l-o-w delivery","This medium size Pegasus was ordered thru Amazon for my granddaughter's birthday, along with a number of other gifts. Everything else arrived in plenty of time for her birthday except for this Pegasus which came nearly a week after the party. The figure itself is very nicely detailed and well-made, but its late arrival was a disappointment. For that reason, I have given it two stars instead of five."
3,safety glasses,They're nice looking glasses and comforatable to wear. The down side is that I can see the frame in my side vision. I bought them for work only to find out that I have to wear black or clear only. So I use them for gardening.
3,Not very easy to listen too,"I read the reviews on this and bought it based on what other people said. I did not enjoy this and found the rhythm, sounds almost annoying to my ears."
1,crap!,"I play music and I am open to a lot of new agey things, have lived in yoga commune, am indian etc.(I know that sounds really weird but I'm just trying to say I'm very into/open to new agey stuff), but I thought these cds were crap. I got it in a vroman's bookstore. Bookstores are rare these days and I appreciate them so much, and I often find they have very exciting products due to the competitiveness of online book shopping. But I believe this product should be taken off the shelves, because I didn't get anything out of it. My musical sense leads me to listen to different things for calming, healing, energisisng etc. I plan on getting a refund. But,I see that everyone else has put excellent reviews, so maybe they are getting something out of it."
4,Relaxing,I have many CDs of this type and by Dr Thompson. He delivers what he promises: a very relaxing massage of the brain. I do warn against listening to this while driving or walking as it definitely zones me out in a few places.
4,interesting...,I still dont understand how this is supposed to help but have not listened to over and over again... Is also great to falling asleep to. ;)
1,does not fit properly,"I bought this to protect my ipod nano. What a dissappointment. The case fits fine, but the problem is you can't plug anything into your ipod with the case on. I tried both my earbuds and my idog and I couldn't hear through either one. The case does not allow enough room for the cord to plug in properly."
4,The Blues to Cure Your Blues,"This album has a wonderfully calming effect. His voice is sad, tragic, and joyful at the same time. The melodies are original and poignant. In fact, I listened to this CD so much and carried it everywhere - I need to buy a replacement since I've managed to leave it somewhere when I wanted it somewhere else - very badly. I was a newer blues listener at the time, but this album cemented the music into my soul. I highly recommend it to anyone who isn't sure about the blues."
5,In a word- GREAT!,"As an independent film maker making the switch from 16mm to digital, this book has been indispensable. Not only does it show how to set up your studio, but also gives you estimates of the cost to step into this brave new world.And what I found truly inspirational was the CD included with the QT movies of other independent animators. Seeing other people's work has always been the best motivation for doing my own. Thank you for putting this together to save us from time wasted trying to figure this out on our own."
4,Good Premise Behind This Book,"As a society we are quick to look inward to analyze our dreams when in actuality we should look outward. The premise behind this book is excellent. The material, however, is a tad dry and tough to get through. If you can finish this book, you will feel truly enlightened to yourself and God's voice within you."
4,Dreams,"I read the book years ago and it has become one I have referred to many. However, being out of print, I could not find a copy in any local bookstore or catalogue. One search in Amazon not only located the book, but gave me several options as to price and supplier. Delivery was a bit slow, but now I have the book and look forward to sharing it with my daughter as a birthday gift."
5,Comprehensive Guide for the Beginning Writer,"Ray Frensham's guide to screenwriting encompasses everything one needs to know before sitting down in front of the computer or with a pad of paper and a pencil. He explains how to adapt fictional material for a screenplay or how to give life to an original idea. He also includes exercises such as watching films and critiquing them.The difficult subjects of character development and story structure are thoroughly covered. You put the book down after reading just a chapter and feel as though you could write a screenplay that day. Frensham also includes suggested reading at the end of each chapter and a plethora of websites (some no longer functional, however) for writers to market their work."
5,Technical Writing Direction at Its Best,"Teach Yourself Screenwriting is one of the best ""how-to"" books I have in my library. From concept to delivery, it covers every aspect of producing a viable script. I am amazed at the examples that Frensham provides his readers; they are unrivaled. This is a must-read for every budding screenwriter."
4,HELP FOR THE ROOKIE WRITERS!,"I appreciate this book, as a tool for starting out. I am working on my first script, which is based upon my first book. Thanks for the great reviews, and experience from the other writers. This is like a peer group, smash it or trash it session. Good Luck to all of you.I also purchaed the ""MOVIE MAGIC SCREENWRITING"" software. Next books will be: ""The Screenwriter's Bible"" and ""How NOT to Write a Screenplay""SHOCK THERAPY PUBLISHING llc."
4,informative yet boring,"this book covers pretty much everything about screenwriting.it teaches you everything from structure,dialogue,characters,re-writes,but it makes it kind of difficult for the novice screenwriter.the author talks to much and confuses you.also as you read,there are excercises that you do.apperently the author wants you to be working on a screenplay while reading this book.bad idea.finish any book and then start your screenplay so you wont be confused."
3,Good Fantasy,"'Horn Crown' is an immensely entertaining epic fantasy. The plot culminates in a classic good vs. evil matchup.At times thought it seemed that Norton gave more attention to detail than plot. She goes to great lengths in describing an ancient castle at the expense of action. I found my mind wandering as I read the three pages of describing stones, hallways and tables. I didn't realize the story had resumed until I was two paragraphs into to, necessitating a re-read. There were several such instances.A good book for a cold night."
4,The voice of 21st century youth,"23 years old. Disillusioned by the artificiality of California. Searching for real meaning. This is the premise of ""Tails: Swimming Both Ways."" It chronicles her adventures as an ""angel,"" traveling the world without money, depending on the Universe to provide.I felt myself growing younger as I read this book. Her search for herself; her sporatic alienation and naievete... it is the story of every child just becoming an adult. At the same time, the book is an adventure, full of wild fun: sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll. Fysche's unapologetic experimentation is the definition of youth, as is her bold rejection of any and all rules dictating proper English.""Tails"" is a page-turner full of questions poetically sought. It will touch the hearts of all those 20-somethings out there, and those old enough to remember what it was like."
1,Abysmal,"As a postgraduate student of English Literature, about to start my PhD, I was disgusted to read this excuse for a waste of paper. 'Fysche' claims to have invented a new form of English, when in actual fact Geoffrey Chaucer spelt and wrote more legibly, and was a great deal funnier. 'Fysche' has merely combined text messaging slang with 'netspeak'. This makes little to no sense at best, and reads worse than written work produced by kindergarten-aged children.I am extremely glad that I did not have to pay over $20 to read this immaturely-written, inane rubbish, instead I borrowed a copy but I regret the few cents I spent on gas to get to the college library and back.Anyone who has even the most basic grounding in English literature and/or language should avoid this book. Literature is supposed to be coherent and well-structured, not resembling a linguistic train-wreck."
5,Communication Breakdown,"Fysche has stretched the limits of the english language in ""Tails."" The oft criticized, rarely understood Fysche delivers a stark autobiographical journey in this book. It is a real page turner and a great read. I recommend this book to anyone and I can't wait for ""One Fysche, Two Fysche, Raw Fysche, Gold Fysche!""Keep up the great work Feesh!"
1,semi- DOA,"It won't respond to the remote. (I know the remote is working, because it controls my other Sony DVD player) Furthermore, the front panel display works only intermittently.I will now see how good the seller is about taking it back and giving me a full refund. (I just went to Walmart and got an NS57p for the same price.) I'll post on how helpful they are. If they make it easy for me to send back for a full refund, I'll give the seller a top rating. Otherwise ...."
4,couch potato,"Although I have had this player a short time, it has played every DVD I have put in it including my wifes Thai DVDs. The Panasonic combo DVD/VCR player that this Sony replaced would not play any of my wifes DVDs and on occasion would not read some of mine until I reinserted the DVD. (to be fair to Panasonic, the VCR section of the player worked fine and the sound and picture were both good). Getting back to the Sony player, the sound and picture quality is great and seems to be an excellent match for my 36"" Sony TV."
4,Great For The Money - But Cheap Construction,"Like other reviewers have said, it plays everything very well.Mine worked fine for about a week and then stopped playing. The drawer would open & close but it wouldn't play a disc.Throwing caution to the wind, I disconnected the cords, removed the 5 screws (1 on each side & 3 in the rear) that were holding the top cover in place and took it off.Lots of room inside - could easily be made 1/2 the width.Plugged in the unit, opened the drawer, put in a DVD and noticed immediately that it wasn't spinning. Gave it a slight nudge and it took off and began to play the disc.Put in another disc and again it needed a nudge to get going. Sprayed a bit of silicone grease on the top bearing of the drive and it's been playing fine ever since.Thought I would share this with you all, in case yours also becomes sluggish."
2,"Great player, doesn't last long",I only got 2 years out of this player. It still plays retail DVD's but playing DVD+R and DVD-R discs is a nightmare. It either doesn't recognize the discs or its a garbled mess on the screen. I also couldn't fast-forward or reverse anymore. It looks like the laser is going bad. It is just a matter of time before it won't play retail DVD's anymore. I guess Sony makes their players disposable to last only a few years. They want to keep you coming back so they can get more of your $$$. If you are looking to buy this I would avoid it and try another model.
1,Bad experience,"I bought the DVPNS50P, which is a similar, if not the same, player. It worked well enough, until it stopped working, about two months after I bought it. Of course I bought the Sony, rather than a cheaper off-brand, thinking the thing frizting in two months would be less likely.So, what I'm writing about is the customer service: ridiculous. The unit qualified for ""exchange"" under the warranty. This means I had to bring it not to Best Buy, where I bought it, but to a UPS Store, and have it packed and shipped, at a supposed discount ($20!). Overnight service for me? Think again! So far, I've been waiting 17 days for the new unit.You would think Sony stood by their products, and that they could therefore afford to take better care of their customers when their products didn't work. This bargain basement customer service would seem to indicate Sony doesn't stand for reliability anymore!"
2,Disappointed and confused,"Our disappointment in this product is based primarily on the zoom feature. When you zoom in/enlarge a picture, the size icon (+2, etc.) remains on the screen. We wanted to use this player on a small tv in the exercise room, and when you view letterboxed movies, it helps to be able to zoom in once or twice. None of the other DVD players we have owned have done this. It's hard to understand what sony was thinking when they created this feature."
5,excellent,lives up to Sony's reputation. A no frills player for those of us that just want to enjoy watching rented movies.
5,It's a Sony,What's not to love? As always Sony has put out a product that is a mixture of cutting edge innovation and reliability. I have had the DVD player for awhile now and am just as happy with my purchase as the day I purchased the DVD player.
3,Not what I expected. Very disappointing.,"Many years ago I purchased this book in its original version - written and illustrated by Dick Bruna with the English Verse by Eve Merriam. Our family created the tradition of reading this book every Christmas Eve. Now that my boys are adults and have children of their own I had searched for ""Christmas"" to give them this year in order that they could continue the tradition. I was thrilled to find it! The cover is the same as are the illustrations. But the text is very different. Gone is the wonderful rhyming text that my sons could recite as the years passed by. They will get the books this year, but I will include a hand written copy of the original poem. What a disappointment."
3,Good and bad points,"I love the simplicity of the book, and the fact that the Holy Family are depicted as having dark brown skin. What I don't like is that the story doesn't follow the Biblical versions of the birth of Christ. This book is better for children under five since beyond that age it's too simple."
4,Generic Lincoln Logs,"Just like Lincoln Logs...only cheaper (or, I should say, less expensive). Quality is on par with the ""real thing."" The color is slightly different, but you'll only notice that if you're mixing the two. Nice canvas storage bag. Enough to build one nice building (see product picture). You may want two (or more) sets to increase flexibility."
1,not worth the money,These slippers were great for a few days then the soles lost all the cushioning and were matted down. Even after running them through the washer they were flat.
3,Comprehensive but a little lengthy,"If you've ever wondered what to do on a da then this is the video for you. Includes activities for kids, too. Everything you could think of doing on a da is in this video so next time you find yourself with nothing to do on a da then do a da do today! However it does seem a little boring at times but some people may appreciate the in-depth look. Especially those who like das."
5,I Do Da,"I love to do things on a Da, and now I know more! If you like to Da, then this is a must have. I found the vaseline suggestion a little over the top, but then again, I've never had so much fun da-ing before. If you da - then this is your da title for sure!"
5,Finally!,"Finally a Bryan Adams 'best of' with 'One Night Love Affair'. It was almost like he was thumbing his nose at those of us who loved that song.Only one hit I see missing from this: 'Do I Have to Say the Words'. The song was not a favorite of mine, but why leave it off an anthology collection? I just hope we get the edited single version of 'I Do it For You.' I hate that long version. Regardless, I can't wait to get this collection."
4,A Full Adams Retrospective,"Bryan Adams leaped to stardom in the mid 80's and continued his hit streak until the mid 90's. Disk one has all the essential songs on this compilation. Songs like ""Cuts Like A Knife"", ""Run To You"", ""Straight From The Heart"", ""Lonely Nights"", ""Heat Of The Night"", ""Heaven"", ""Somebody"", ""This Time"" and ""Summer Of '69"" are worthy of classic rock status and timeless hits. Mr. Adams scored his two biggest hits from movies, ""(Everything I Do) I Do It For You"" and ""Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman"" but they are overwrought, sappy ballads. Disk number two is for diehard fans only. The DVD is a recent live concert and although a nice added bonus, not essential viewing."
3,good mix,This cd contains a good mix of well known bryan adams as well as some not quite as well known. i really enjoy it!
4,works well,these work well but the plastic end caps always fall off and they dont fit tight into all pole cups.
3,cute for pictures of growing kids,"This is like a soft stuffed animal that is long and has a measurement on it with plastic envelopes to hold pictures of what the kid looks like as he/she grows, cute idea. Not a super high quality but good enough. There are no beans on this just in case the name confuses you as it did me."
3,About a rare make,"This is one of the few books on the American Motors Corporation, unfortunately. The company had an interesting history with its highs and lows before it went out and deserves at least one ultimate paperwork on it. I bought it because I wanted technical and production information on the Pacer. And exactly this is not the topic of the book. It is a documentation with very minimal text (mostly the straight written history from the beginning of the consortium to the end in the nest of Chrysler and Renault), no trivia, no frame articles, no test results, no tech data or detailed figures.On the ""plus"" side of the book are the nice b/w photos with cars shown. The quality of the book is okay for the price.At least, I am still waiting for the guy/girl writing the fundamental, colored, illustrated book on American Motors..."
1,Sharp corners stripped my wheels out.,I got this hoping to better support the high power of LiPo batteries in a Stampede VXL 4x4. But metal edges are sharp and stripped out my expensive wheels. I wouldn't recommend these metal hubs with plastic wheels.
3,Good......but could be better,I had recieved a set of these bottles as a baby shower gift. One thing I did like about them was that the wide bottle made shaking up the formula very easy. The problem was with the nipples. We contstantly were having problems with the nipples pushing up and into the bottle causing the whole thing to spill onto our daughter. I have spoken with a friend who also tried these bottles and she and her husband had the same problem with the nipples. I have since switched bottle brands and now use the Playtex nursers and have had no problems at all with them.
2,Ughh. Not worth the price.,"I have given this product 2 stars. It might be a fab bottle for you, but personally it was a nightmare for us. Just make sure you have other bottles on hand, in the event your little one doesn't like Avent. For the 1st 6 months of my daughter's life, feeding was a horrible experience. The nipples are pricey & don't fit any other bottle. My daughter got to the point where she wouldn't nurse from a bottle. I ran out & bought some cheaper nipples & bottles and finally found one she would take.Yes, the nipple on the Avent bottle is more like a mommy's and baby does have to work harder to get the formula or breast milk out. But there are other brands out there that are just as good (I personally think) than Avent. If you want to be trendy...go ahead & spend the money. Just make sure you've got those other bottles ready, just in case. I wish we had!!!"
1,Not worth the $,These bottles are not worth the $$. They get more air bubbles then any other I've tried and you have to purchase their special nipples for bottles none of the others work. Even the slow nipples for newborns pores milk out too fast and my baby gets an upset stomach.
2,"Leaky, leaky, leaky","I bought these bottles because of their great popularity. However, no matter how dry each part was, they constantly leaked. The nipples never look clean, they get very filmy looking, even after boiling or putting them in the dishwasher. My daughter had a lot of problems with gas and these bottles contributed to that. I switched to the Dr. Brown bottles, and she slept better, and did not have these painful gas problems. The bottles also cleaned better than the Avent."
2,NOT worth the hassle!!,"I bought these bottles because of all the recommendations I have read. I wish I didn't. They leak all the time. No matter how tight (or loose) I screw the cap no, they always leak. Also, because my son's mouth has to open so wide to fit the large nipple, the milk is constantly dripping out the side of his mouth and down his chin. The only good thing about this bottle is that he doesn't have a problem switching back and fourth between nursing and these bottles. However, I would still recommend you try something else first."
2,Too leaky!,"I have used both the 4 oz. and the 9 oz. bottles to feed my 3 month old son, and the bottles are so leaky! The problem seems to have gotten progressively worse over time because now they leak to the point that I'm not sure how much my son is ingesting and how much is soaking his bib and burp cloth. I tried adjusting the nipple and tightening or loosening the collar - nothing has stopped the leakage. I have switched to Gerber New Traditions bottles with no problem so far. I gave this product 2 stars instead of 1 because the nipple shape is very similar to the real thing, and that's always a plus for someone who wants to combine bottle and breastfeeding."
2,Avent Bottles,"The only nice things I can honestly say about these bottles is that my twins can easily switch from breast to bottle with them and that they are easy to clean and mix formula, BUT... THEY LEAK! This is most anoying when you have two screaming babies and the bottle is leaking as you're trying to make the bottles. For how expensive these bottles are, they should not leak. I have tried various ways of putting the caps on, etc., but they always leak. I don't have this problem with generic, cheap bottles."
2,These bottles are a joke!,"The problem with these bottles is the newborn slow flow nipple flows too fast. Milk just squirts out when you turn the bottle over and my daughter chokes and she is covered with milk down her chin and neck. Plus, by the time she is half way finished there are so many bubbles inside she gets very gassy.(we make formula ahead of time to avoid shaking the bottle)They have leaked occasionally around the neck.We switched to the best bottles, which are Dr. Browns. They work great! No bubbles or leaking and easy to clean."
2,leaks too much,"this bottle started out ok until after about 5 months of usage, it started leaking around the collar no matter how tight the collar was screwed on. this was so annoying, especially at night when you are sleepy. you have to remove the collar and nipple, put it back on, turn it upside down and pray that this time it wont leak (after going through this a few time you will want to throw the bottle into the wall). eventually you will get lucky and the bottle wont leak but for the next feeding you go through this process all over again. try the playtex disposable nurser (the drop in liner is fabulous), buy the one with the avent-like nipple. so far this is excellent, no leaks and no wash."
1,Leaky Bottle,"At first I thought these bottles were great! Now, I hate them. They are always leaking. When I shake the bottle to mix the formula, formula flies all over the place. If not then, when I tilt the bottle to my daughter's mouth and she eats for awhile, when I take it away, formula drips all down the side of the bottle, all over her and my hands. I do not recommend this bottle to anyone!"
2,Leaky Bottles,"I used Avent bottles for my 21 month old, but experienced many leaks. However, I decided to give them another go when I had my son in November. Once again, I had the same problem, they leak constantly - I even shook the bottle on a recent flight to mix the formula when it sprayed all over the passenger next to me - quite embarressing.On the positive side, when they don't leak, my son seems to like them, they are easy to clean and work well with the Avent microwave sterilizer (which I wouldn't change for anything!)However, if I do have any more children, I will probably use a different brand of bottle."
2,Disappointed with this System,"I am very disappointed with the Avent bottle system. I purchased the Avent hand breast pump and Avent bottles 8 months ago when my son was born, and I am frustrated with the poor performance of these products. The bottle seals are prone to failure resulting in a great deal of leaking, and it is difficult to achieve and maintain effective suction with the Avent pump. For the cost of Avent I would expect a more reliable product. I would not recommend purchasing Avent products, and I plan on invensting in a different brand with my next child. Wish I would have saved my money the first time around by avoiding Avent."
3,LEAKING IS A PROBLEM!!,"Please bottles are great except for the fact that they leak. I tried to be extra careful not to tighten the cap to much, yet it seems like I still end up with one leaky bottle. I think the seal is too sensitive. These bottles are too expensive for the seals to break that easily. The nipples and shape of the bottle are great!! But that leaking problem can get very annoying."
2,These bottles LEAK!,These bottles are so frusterating! They leak all over the place. The only thing these bottles are good for is mixing formula. The wide neck bottle makes it easy to pour the powder.
1,Leaks!!!,I purchased the Avent Starter set and they worked wonderfully for about 1 month - then they continuously leaked. I bought new nipples/bottles and just ended up being a waste of money and a huge problem. My daughter would not take to any other bottle -- I finally found playtex natural shape and would highly recomend anything from playtex.
1,"Leak, Leak, Leak","As a breastfeeding mom, I wanted to provide my son with an easy transition to bottle (for when I pumped). I purchased AVENT after reading the reviews on all the baby product websites. I even read the reviews about the leaks, but because there were so few, I thought it was just a fluke. Wrong! They leak-- a lot. They don't just sprinkle, they poor. My husband and baby were soaked every night while attempting to bond. Other people will tell you that it is all in how you twist the top on--not so much! Who has time to turn a top just right? You can't twist too tight or too loose with this thing. I want to be able to just get it ready quickly and feed my crying infant! I bought the Dr. Brown's wide mouth bottles instead and they have been wonderful!!!! No special mechanics because they make their bottles for people who need ease! Do not buy AVENT!!!"
1,Avent leaks!,Bottom line...these bottles leak! Not every time but when you have a hungry baby and formula is spilling out all over them they don't want to wait until you can fix it. The bottle gets sticky. They need changed and sometimes you will need to change clothes yourself! I tried all the little tricks you read about online but eventually one will leak. And for the price of these bottles one is too many! Do yourself a favor and buy the Dr. Browns. It's a little more cleaning but less aggrevation and happier babies. Also they are nicer to hold!
1,Waste of money,For the price of these bottles you would like it to last more than a month. BUT IT DOES NOT. It leaks BAD. If you don't mind you or your baby to smell like formula then it's great for you. But I would not buy again or give as a gift to anyone.
1,Waste of money!,These bottles leak and are a waist of time and money! I read instructions throughly and bottles still leaked after a week of use so I decided to purchase the original Platex bottles and I am now satisfied. Sometimes new isn't always better.
2,"LEAKY, LEAKY, LEAKY!!!!",These would be good bottles if they didn't leak! Milk ends up all over parent and baby. Not a good choice!!
2,Leaky Avent,Is there some magic way to get these bottles NOT to leak? Do the cap & nipple have to be perfectly aligned in order not to drip all over my baby ( & me for that matter)? Going to use evenflo comfi exclusively now. They do not leak.
5,Love at first sip!,"These are the best bottles ever! They are a little ""pricey"", but they are worth every penny. My baby gets very little air in her belly since we started with these bottles. They are heaven sent - my baby has a full happy little tummy!"
4,Avent Follower,"I have been using Avent products for my firstborn since the day he is born. He is now nearly 6 months old and the bottles have not given me any problems. To counter the problem of leakage turn the cap counter-clockwise, hear a ""click"" before you screw on as per normal."
1,Don't buy them,I have tried five different types of bottles and these are horrible. Don't waste your money. Dr. Brown's is the way to go!
4,good bottles,"I breastfed and formula fed my baby and the avent bottle was very good for me because it's wide at the bottom of the nipple just like a breast, so the baby would suck fine from both and didn't realize the difference (like some baby does and then they don't take one of the other anymore!). The only thing with Avent bottles is that they aren't the easiest to clean, but they are worth their price. Just make sure you tight kind of hard the cap otherwise it will leak. I will recommend them to people that breastfeed and bottlefeed."
2,They definitely leak!,"I like the Avent bottles because of the shape of the nipple. However, the bottles leak like crazy. It's annoying because whenever we give our son a bottle, he ends up getting all wet. I'd really recommend trying another bottle."
1,Very leaky bottle,"We've been using these bottles for 3 months now. We experience leaks about 20% of the time - always at the most inopportune time. Sure there are many reader suggestions on how to try and prevent leaks, but these are hit or miss. How hard can it be to design a bottle that doesn't leak? Buyer beware."
2,over rated...,we couldn't tell any difference in the amount of gas our baby had...we tried practically every bottle available and the old fashioned plastic bottle with the plain nipple worked best.
2,my breastfed baby would not take to these,I recomend only buying one until you see how you baby likes the nipple. My baby could not latch on the these huge nipples with his tiny mouth.
2,not for my baby,"My son is breast fed, but we have given him an occasional bottle. He refused these. I got them because of all the great things I heard about them. I thought it would be easier for him to switch back and forth. No chance. He hates them. He hate the Playtex disposables too. He now takes Gerber bottles, traditional and New Traditions."
3,worked 50% of the time...,"I like the nipple flow on these bottles for my newborn, as well as the small bottle size, but I found that the nipple only vented air back into the bottle properly about 50% of the time. The rest of the time, my baby would nurse until the pressure was too great, de-latch, and air would flood into the bottle through the nursing hole."
1,Avent bottles L-E-A-K!!,"We've assembled nipples and rings while wet and while dry, and we still experience leakage about a third of the time we use these bottles. And when I say leakage, I mean BIG POOLS OF MILK spilling out onto our daughter's clean clothes, sometimes when she's very sleepy. If an Avent bottle ever leaks onto something really nice, I'll consider sending the company a cleaning bill."
1,Too Fast!,I used the slowest flow nipple and my baby had formula spurting out the sides of her mouth! Also these were very bubbly! I switched to the Playtex Disposable System and have no problems ever since. Do yourself a favor and don't buy too many of any bottle until you find one that works for your baby.
5,It's The Best Baby Bottle Period!,"We have to admit that after 3 weeks of our son crying after feeding time even though we burped him and burped him he still had GAS!!!! We tried the Playtex Brand. We tried the Johnson's Brand. He still got gas after feeding. I did some research and figured that the Avent system just might work. He took to it without fussing and low and behold NO GAS!!!! Of course there was the ususal burping, but afterward no crying and no gas. Thanks Avent! To those out there who say they get the dribble when feeding, I say: It's not the bottle on the bum. It's the bum on the bottle. You're feeding him wrong. To those who have problems with the formula coming out too slow or not at all, I say: Hello, have you ever heard of using a sterilized needle to clean it out? Nipples do get clogged you know. It's not the manufactures fault that you aren't keeping it clean. Remeber to sterilize both the bottle and the nipple. You need both working properly for a happy healthy baby."
1,They leak. A lot.,"These bottles leak. It doesn't matter how you assemble them, or if you assemble them wet, or dry, or in space, or in a cave. They leak. Terribly. And Avent knows it. They will even replace your leaky bottles if you call 1800 54avent. Of course the ones they replace it with also leak. Buy Dr. Browns instead."
2,leaky bottles,The bottles kept leaking I thought I had done something wrong. I tried buying new nipples but it does not matter. I use them just to store formula.
3,They would get 5 stars if they didn't leak!,"I like these bottles. I like they way they look. I like the wide design. I like the easy to read markings...pretty much everything except that about 25% of the time they leak. A lot has been written about this that they leak if you over-tighten them. Well, it is difficult to judge what is tight enough (so they don't leak) but not too tight(so they don't leak) I shouldn't have to put that much thought into making a bottle! Avent needs to work on this and make it so they NEVER leak. Then they will have a great bottle!"
3,Wanna get wet?,"I bought a few Avent bottles on the recommendation of my doctor. My daughter was having trouble breastfeeding and these nipples helped train her to open her mouth more to eat. As great as that was, I found the leakage quite irritating. A lot of times as I took the bottle out of her mouth, it leaked all over her. With a newborn, there are enough things to clean and take care of. The leakage didn't help! But again, the nipple shape and size were a great help."
1,Less Gas and Air???!!!,"I purchased these bottles based on that Advertisement thinking they would be great to have for my newborn. HOWEVER i was horribly mistaken because these bottles are no different than any other normal bottle. They definitely do not reduce the amount of air my baby gets. I totally think this is false advetising in its finest, especially for a first time mom like myself trying to find a good product for their child. Go with PLAYTEX!!!! They are absolutely wonderful bottles and my daughter gets NO AIR!!!"
2,Milk ends up everywhere,"The advent bottles and nipples are terrible. My baby would not breasfead so I switched to bottles. The advent bottles with a newborn size 1 nipple tended to let too much milk flow through them. The baby spit up a lot of milk and it went down her chest. Also, she was sucking in too much air. These are supposed to be newborn nipples with slow flow, but they flow way too fast."
3,OK bottles,"I've pretty much only used Avent bottles since I started bottle-feeding when my baby was 2 weeks old. The bottles are OK but not without problems. The main problem is that the nipple ring doesn't always screw securily into the bottle, and more than once I've ended up spilling a lot of the milk (that's very painful when you work so hard to pump every drop out). Their nipples also don't seem to be any better than other nipples. My baby has sucked plenty of air through them, and they certainly didn't help her take to the breast. Moreover, as they are larger than usual, you can't fit them into formula bottles (now that she's taking formula).But all in all, I'm not unhappy with them and I keep using them."
3,Leaky,"I started using the Avent bottles when my son was 3 days old, at first I had no problem with them, but eventually they started leaking. It is a problem espcially at night when you have to change his clothes and yours too. I am defintly going to try another brand."
1,"leaky, leaky, leaky!!!!!","I breastfed my daughter for nine months and then chose Advent while weaning, hearing that they are the best for weaning. My husband and I are so frustrated, they leak constantly. My child's clothes and carseat are ruined. We tried tightening the cap and screwing it on loosely, the bottles still leak. It it unfortunate, as the nipple and bottle shape seem to work great with breast fed babies. I am greatly disappointed."
1,"I don't like them, and neither did baby","First of all, they do leak. I haven't tried just not tightening them so much but I didn't think they were that overly tight.I tried these with my now three year old, and my 2 year old triplets. None of them,for some reason, liked these bottles. They're too big, they're also odd shaped, so they take up too much room in my already full dishwasher. T hey did nothing for my babies stomach aches and gas. I got rid of these and got plain older Gerber (costs less) for the triplets and Dr. Brown's to help with my son's gas."
4,I like the bottles but...,"I like the bottles but the leaking is an occasional problem. I have just read the suggestions on this feedback forum and will try not to overtighten the bottles. I haven't tried any other type of bottle so I cannot really compare them but I do know that when I do have to burp my baby, he seems to burp with just a few pats on the back. Very easy. I think the bottles have something to do with this. UPDATE... After using these a year now I can say the fix-all is indeed not to overtighten the lid. I read later it distorts the silicon of the nipple causing the leak. Once I figured that out, I quit hurling them leaking and full against the wall."
1,Bottles LEAK,"These bottles were recommended to me, but unfortunately my experience with them was never good with both the 4oz and 9oz bottles. The bottles LEAK when you're shaking the formula, on your baby, and in the diaper bag if not in an upright position. I thought that the problem was with one bad bottle but it keeps happenig - after bying all the accessories for it I find myself looking for new bottles. I gave it a good try, my baby is almost 4 months old but it hasn't been worth it."
3,Bottles leak after extended use,"These bottles are great in the beginning, but the more you use them, the more likely the nipple will fall (not quite getting the lip to where it needs to be) and leaking occurs. It is very frustrating! Most of mine don't, but when I grab the few that do, I get nothing but puddles. My only suggestion is to be cautious when using these and check to make sure the nipple is in correctly and not partially falling in."
3,Not So Bad,"These bottles are very nice, but they do leak. My husband has had many fits with leak problems. My daughter really transitioned to these bottles well, so it was worth my time to troubleshoot. Once I adjusted the nipples on the ring the leaks stopped."
