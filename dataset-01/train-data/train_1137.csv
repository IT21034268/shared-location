4,unique book,Lots of celebs in this one. Looks like deCadenet has compiled photos from the 80's to today. Unique and very personal and intimate feeling.
4,Touching,"Rare Birds is basically a collection of photos that look like they should be taped up on the walls of a teenagers bedroom, if that teenager was the coolest girl at some hip downtown New York private school. This is a good thing. The book is a nice slice of popular culture in the early aughts (almost all the photos are of celebrities like Keanu Reeves, Drew Barrymore, Nick Valensi and the other Stroke boys) but the photos are also sweet and intimate. There is real affection between subject and photographer. It is a look into what Amanda De Cadanet's life might look like in its most idealized form. Its true that Rare Birds isn't the most brilliant or original book of photography out there, but clearly that wasn't De Cadenet's goal. It seems more like she wanted to show the photos and say ""here I am. Share with me."" And at that she does a beautiful job."
2,celebrity hacking at a real art-form,"There is nothing redeeming about Ms. Cadenet's photography, except as a document of the people she slept with. and its an impressive litany of boy stars that she has serviced...unfortunately, the camera skills she utilizes are not as impressive as her personal offerings....by a long shot. taking the lead paved by Hiromix and Terry Richardson, the premise behind her attempts, are the 'snapshot' window into her volatile, star powered life. but most of these badly lit, movie star and rock star 'moments' feel staged, superficial and lacking the unseen touches and bold reality that carved out a niche for Hiromix and Terry.I don't believe Amanda ever achieved a celebrity status indepedent of the boy stars she was servicing, and for the most part they all seem aware and weary of the photographer's presence. time to go home Amanda."
4,"when it rains, it pours","i am going to keep it short. this album has more highlights than pitfalls. there are tracks (Hare Krishna) that only work if you listen to the entire album in one sitting. if you normally shy away from bloated double albums and/or albums with storylines (however vague), this may be the album to change your mind. song 10 is perhaps the most emotionally ""right-on"" representation of bitter heartbreak ever recorded. my second gripe is that the quality of recording shifts from track to track, leaving some songs lacking in either treble or bass. in the end, however, the raw energy on ZEN ARCADE is amazing, if not exhausting. if you like this album, try METAL CIRCUS by Husker Du."
5,Essential,"Husker Du at their prime. For me, their golden years were in 1983 and 1984 when they released the brilliant Metal Circus -ep and this classic album the following year. This is where they started to move from all out noisy hardcore to more melodic stuff but weren't as soppy as they'd become. (sorry) You can not possibly overestimate the effect this massive and genius collection had on the alternative rock scene. Just don't play it in the car when your parents are sitting in the front. Believe me, I've tried."
5,best husker album ever,"its a hard listen at first, especially after the latter candy apple grey.The music is perfectly put together with each other, every song moving into the same direction.flawless and still one my all time top 5 albums...you cant go wrong with this album, just dont give up"
5,"""krsna krsna, hare hare""","you cant go wrong with any husker du record but this one gives you it all, it brings together the hardcore the band played at lighting speed leading up to this record and also showcased the power-pop and melodies to come. its the band at its most ferocious, wall of noise best, the band at its most melodic and beautiful, the band at its apex. just go buy it you wont be disappointed..for extra fun go find the actual record..a double album with a gate fold...this is an epic recording and an import one in the history of indie-underground-alternative whatever music."
3,Eh....,"One of the most overrated albums of all time. This has some amazing songs, but it has a ton of stinkers too. And the damn thing is just too long."
3,Very Average,"This album seems to get more critical acclaim than Citizen Cane and I for the life of me can't understand why. Just for containing the long boring, annoying instrumental Reoccurring Dreams it should lose that status, but there is tons of other unlistenable stuff as well. Even one of the best tracks ""Turn On The News"" has incredibly simple minded lyrics that take away from the power of the music. There are some good tracks scattered about like the awesome ""Pink Turns To Blue""(the only necessary track), but even paired down to a single album this would not be a classic. Other Husker Du albums like ""New Day Rising"", ""Flip Your Wig"", ""Candy Apple Grey"", and even ""Warehouse: Songs and Stories"" are far superior works. Even the EP ""Metal Circus"" has more worthwhile material. Husker Du is an awesome band so if you are just now discovering them do not start here because you will never understand why they are so highly regarded."
2,Unhinged and unimpressed,"2 1/2Huge (had no idea Pearl Jam alone ripped so much) influence and occasional gnashing success aside, this early alt-rock sounds tired, whose songwriting absolutely falls into the overrated category even if offering a prototype for more adept angsty audio thieves to plunder."
2,Lookout,"I came across this album because I so often saw it mentioned as an all time classic album. I was very dissapointed. Most of it is very much in a hardcore punk vein. Many of the songs seemed indistinguishable to me. I did like the song pink to blue. Some of the instrumentals are listening. I don't dislike this style of music, but when there is so much of it and so little variance on one album I find it hard to get"
1,I did not get the item ordered,This product never arrived although we ordered it several weeks ago. The other books we ordered came two weeks ago.
3,TMNT,"Its a good game, but a little boring, kids were bored after an hour. I don't think I'll be purchasing anymore Ninja turtle games. The seller is good. Game was in good condition and got it on time, but the game itself nothing exciting."
3,old-school,"I think the game is fun if you're not looking for something with a really involved story line - something you can pick up and play for a few minutes while in the waiting room at the doctor's office or something. (Which is exactly what I wanted, so it worked out perfectly.) The controls are simple but the game still manages to be challenging, despite the fact that it's repetitive. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something to kill time. (It's also one of the less expensive DS games, which is always good!)"
5,We've listened to this every night for almost 6 years,"This has been the night music for all 3 of my kids. The CD has been in use EVERY.SINGLE.NIGHT for almost 6 years. I still like it! The quality is great, and it is in tune, which is so rare in kids CDs. My kids can't go to sleep without it."
1,Off the mark,"I was looking for a miracle cure and this fell just short of the mark. My little guy hated riding in the car so I thought if I could lull him to sleep then I could get my errands done. He just cried over the music. If you are going to have to listen to this cd yourself just know that the lyrics are a little different then the ones I remember and they heart beat track drowns them out at times.When the car idea didn't work I tried to use the cd after breastfeeding and/or before bed. However, it didn't work at home either. In the end his Fisher-Price Natures Touch Cradle Swing was our lifesaver. Even when we had trouble getting him back to sleep after late night feedings.To those Moms suffering from sleepless nights I hope you find what works for you."
2,Will Calm My Baby if it Doesn't Drive her Crazy First,"My daughter needs to have music playing when she sleeps. That's just a fact because we in a house in the city. This is the weirdest cd I have ever heard. It doesn't really stop her from crying but it does sometimes put her in this weird daze. It does not help her sleep, in fact, it keeps her from sleeping and after a while, she is agitated until I turn it off. I'd say if you don't normally play music for your baby she or she may fall for this. I'd recommend just playing any CD that you currently own on repeat mode during naps. The point of playing music is so that when a baby re-enters the light sleep phase, normal sounds in the home don't startle and awaken her. If you feel that you must buy something specifically for your baby to hear, I recommend Woody Guthrie ""Nursery Days"" for your baby. It has become the soundtrack of our lives."
5,Wonderful CD,"I had no idea who Patrick Fiori was until I stumbled upon this CD 3 years ago in Paris. After listening to the first 3 tracks I bought it without any further hesitation. He has a smooth clear high voice which is easy on the ear. The music, being sung in French is too marvellous for words. I don't understand a word, but it's great!! Buy it, you won't regret it!"
1,"This is an awesome record, but do NOT buy it from Radioactive!!!!","One star because this is an unauthorized bootleg. Shame on Amazon for stocking it. Radioactive is a private label that ""reissues"" out of print records by poorly digitizing vinyl and then pressing CDs without permission from the original artists, and without compensating them. Wait for a legit reissue.For more info, see: yogarecords[DOT]com[SLASH]press[SLASH]radioactive[DOT]html"
3,fish scale,fish scale is servicable- not too great for small fish seems to be more accurate over 5 lbs but nice with a tape measure to get fork length- i would reccomend for someone who fishes alot to get bragging rights but not for a person who wants certifiable weights.
2,Ehh,This product is just ok....Its very light and feels cheaply made...The hook for the fish is kinda small yet bulky at the same time and its a spring weight that isn't as easy to read vs digital. The measuring tape is ok...it sticks a little but is pretty flimsy....overall id skip this product.
4,...and here's the same song with Dez singing instead...,Not the essential album by this band since these are the demos. And many of these tracks are featured here in 3 variations with three different singers. Some of these songs you don't find on THE EARLY YEARS or are different versions. The early flag stuff is gold and Chavo's versions here give the songs a more snotty adolescent fit. I like. A bit different from the out your gourd psycho streak heard from Rollins on DAMAGED (essential!) You'll need this to complete the collection.
5,It rocked. It was totally punk.,"I'm 29, and in band. My prior band (if I reveal the name, i reveal my identity) was also really punk until people noticed us. Our influences included Black Flag, Bad Brains, The Melvins, and Scream (which i was once in) as well. After i heard this album for the first time, i was hooked. It just rocks!"
1,NO GOOD !!,"Compilation of the pre- Rollins era of the band,featuring LOTS of sub par demos and rehearsal quality tracks by the 3 different singers.Do yourself a favour get THE FIRST 4 YEARS instead,which is a killer comp of official 7 inches releases,comprising the same 3 previous singers without redundancy and a sound so powerful it ll crack your ceiling,guaranteedI m a huge fan of the Flag but put this cd on E Bay after the first listen.This cd is a f...ing ripoff,not suitable for even the die hard fans !!!!!"
5,Terrific!!,Bacitracin is hard to beat for wound healing and these little packets are very handy to store and to carry. Expecially for Moms of yound kids who may fall at any time. Slips easily into a purse.This is simply a great product.
5,WODERFUL COMEBACK,"I think it's great that Mattel makes Delancey dolls once agin(if you ask me,Delancey is the most original,everything else is already seen).And it's a wonderful comeback as well.Dramatic,almost.This doll is gorgeous and the poll and everything else just make me want this doll even more.And I think it's a perfect timing as well,because it's never too late or too early to launch a great toy.So I say,Mattel did it agin,proving that My Scene aren't copying Bratz."
5,Hi! Wishbone da dog.,"Wishbone is what one might call a amazing dog.Has more adventures than one can count playing a variety of people.It really cute to see him put a hat or shirt or pants and play Hercales,Sherlock Homes,Frankenstien,and all sorts you would think would be very akward on four legs.And did I forget? OF COURSE HE TALKS!A high funny voice that seems to match him well.In this one a cowboy hero is what he's playing having to fight a drunken ranch hand along with his pal I think called Bill.I don't want to give away much more but It's a good family movie thats exciting and interesting.In real life(For Wishbone imagines his adventures in another time)His owner and friends are trying to keep the mayors name clear.In this movie the Kids have become Teenagers so It's the later years of Wishbone.Anyhow I didn't give spoilers and I hope you got the idea of the movie.ARF!"
5,Crucible of Terror,"Excellent story. The brutality of the Nazis and their willing accomplices--the general German population--is mind boggling. The similarities of how the Nazis gained the confidence of the people, and what's happening today makes the hair stand up on end."
5,Excellent!,Beautiful story about hope and where you can find it even when everything around you dead.
5,Faith under trial,"An outstanding example of what a lack of humanity, under the evil influences of Satanic rule, can produce. This coupled with a persons recognition of spiritual truth and embracing it under such brutal conditions, and the obvious Divine help he recieves through it all."
3,UK's Wasted Youth,This is the UK version. From the East End of London - Ken Scott and co - very VU - with some P Furs thrown in (plus a little Only Ones)..They were the next big thing in the late eighties - but never got off the ground. A surprisingly good LP nontheless..Rocco went on to form Flesh for LuLu..Do the caveman!!!yeah!!Warning do not confuse with the USA's Wasted Youth..
4,Fast Shipping!,"I was really surprised how fast the opener came. SO, fast in fact that it came just in time for me to locate the ""lost garage door opener""--but now my husband can have one! Thanks!"
5,Works great,"A quick and prompt transaction.This garage door opener easily programmed on my Liftmaster Garage Door opener. Press and hold the button on the door opener, press the button on the clicker. You are done. Battery was included."
1,Wrong product,Compnay sent wrong products twice - They made me pay for the return mail both times plus extra postage. Not happy.
1,Send another product,"Some weeks ago I bought this control for my garage door, the seller send me another model instead this one arguing that it's also works with my garage door, the other product was cheaper and it didnt work. I leave EEUU, so I can ask for refund. I don't recomend to buy it also takes 2 weeks to arrive."
5,Chamberlain Remote 950CB,"I ordered this to replace a worn out remote on an older 1/2HP opener. It arrived within the time promised, the setup worked perfectly, and it was very economical."
5,Technician,"Brand new and worked like a charm, can't complain, besides, it was more expensive here locally. Thanx Appreciate it.Raul"
5,Gate controls,Great product quality at a great price. You save me a lot of money because my other choice was to bye a new gate motor system.
2,Not what expected,"Purchased it expecting the 2 volume set, instead got one book. Decent condition, but had to return it in hopes of finding a complete set. Felt a little deceived."
2,Only One Book,"I totally agree, why are they telling ""Volume Set 2"" and giving only 1 Book.. Received only one book... Really this deceiving."
3,Love and Friendship Review,"I found the style in which Jane Austen writes very entertaining and captivating. The use of letters to describe all the events in the novel that the main character Laura experiences or hears from her friends Marianne and Isabel. This novel is increadible especially because Jane Austen wrote it at the age of 14, when weighing it against her other sucessful novels, this is not her best piece. I recommend it to any reader who is willing to appreciate the language over the substance."
4,An excellent history of the British Battleship in WWII.,"Peter Smith writes what is probably the best book available on the British battleship, and by extension, the battleship in general. I pride myself on my knowledge of British naval operations, but was surprised to learn a great deal. The depictions of the Mediterreanean/Malta operations, as well as convoy actions are especially good. In what is perceived as the first ""Carrier war"" it is striking to see the vital role the battleship played. Smith is quite correct when he states that Britain could not have won the war without her battleships."
5,Great book for beginning fly fishers!,This book is well written in a light yet very informative manner. The author's cut to the basics and keep it simple. Well worth the price and the reading.
5,A Great Wodehouse work!,"By Jove! This is a wonderful Jeeves offering! No one is better then Wodehouse at putting words together! You will really laugh with this - and perhaps that is just what you need if you are reading this! Go ahead, enjoy!And if you love Wodehouse, here is a very funny who-dun-it and Wodehouse's only mystery - its rare, so enjoy it too!Death At The Excelsior: A British Humor ClassicBoth very well recommend!"
3,Five,This book was a Christmas gift for a family member. It was one she asked for. I did not have the opportunity to read it.
3,Well... one out of two ain't bad,"I loved David Dorsey's ""The Force"", particularly for its vivid andsympathetic chrarcterization of the Xerox sales reps he observed atwork. So I was delighted to see a novel by Dorsey... until I opened itto see a ""dramatis personae"" list. For fewer than 20 characters? In arelatively short book? What -- was I going to have trouble keeping themstraight? Unfortunately, yes. Dorsey's ad agency characters all seem tohave the same urbane, jokey tone, and his urban black living-on-the-edgecharacters are even more puzzling, lapsing in and out of Ebonics likebad actors (or an author who isn't sure if it's racist or realist) andbeing overly based in stereotype (the basketball-playing gang-banger,the voluptuous caramel beauty). Mr. Dorsey is an EXTREMELY skillfulnon-fiction writer. I would love to see what he'd do with a real-lifescenario involving a Euro-American who works in a predominantlyAfrican-American company. But this book fails like crazy. If this isyour first"
2,amazon only shipped 1 small package,"I only received 1 small 7.3oz package instead of pack of 6, severeal cookies are broken also. When I call amazon customer service, they want me to mail this one back first and then possible send me the other 5. Too much hassle, I just gave up. I'll never buy cookies from amazon again."
2,Doesn't work on heavier cane.,Too Weak to hold my heavier cane. Will not open enough for a larger diameter. Sildes up to the top of the cane. Surface to hold cane on table not very sticky.
2,Not Good,"Doesn't balance like they make you think, only way it stays is if the cane tip is touching the ground.."
2,Too small to grip .. keeps falling off.,"It's a wonderful idea and it might work on something VERY narrow (about 1/2"" around), however it does not work on any of my canes. The circle is too small .. it only reaches about half way around and that isn't enough to ""grip"" the cane. It keeps falling off."
5,Loon Lake novels,"I love these novels. They have great characters and are fast paced. Mystery, mayhem and fishing - who could ask for more?"
4,"Sharp, smart songs.","I remember seeing the Adverts as a teenager, and loving the sharpness of the songs: good songs, wry and smart -- The Adverts were about something more than Gaye Advert's mascara.Immortal Rich demonstrates that TV Smith has lost none of his songwriting flair. Intelligent, observant songs, well-produced, well-sung rants about the state of England, soul-selling, and the way things are going ('The Thin Green Line' about the green wellie wearing english middle-classes, is a treat, and painfully accurate.)The high point of the album is probably The Day We Caught The Big Fish, which does rather feel as if it wandered in from a different album."
1,Sugar Free Jelly Belly Beans,"These sugar free jelly beans are not a successful substitute for diabetics to use. They are individually wrapped and very difficult to unwrap.I was so frustrated by trying to unwrap that I threw them away. The taste is not superior to the sugar frees available at retail stores and sugnificantly more expensive, not including shipping charges. I believe that the one pound weight advertised included the advertisment, making the net weight less that a pound."
1,More work than they are worth!,"Each tiny jelly bean is individually wrapped! This is not bargain buy. You are paying mostly for wrapping!The label had ""sugar free"" penned in by hand. It did not inspire confidence."
2,Overpriced?,"I just purchased this product from a high-end, specialty gift shop for $6.00. It was the exact same item."
3,Little Itty Bitty Jelly Beans,These are little itty bitty INDIVIDUALLY WRAPED jelly beans. The taste is not so bad as far as sugar free jelly candy goes but I would not purchase again because of all the work that went into unwrapping all of them to put into a small bowl.
2,Subpar but with good qualities.,"Ok I had bought the 1991 Red Krayola - The Parable Of Arable and the sound quality was great however the track cuts were not right. the first track hurricane fighter plane was actually two free form freakouts Hurricane and Transparent Radiation all on one track. So I have sought a reissue with the track splits that were right. I found this one and it suits that purpose.Now The sound. Wow bad job. This was reissued, claimed to be re-mastered, and they must have transfered direct to the computer, or cd, right from the record and with bad equipment at that. Ok so I now at least know how to put the proper track cuts in the first one I bought. Unless someone comes out with a reissue that has great sound and proper track cuts."
1,they smell,"These hangers are coated with something that smells really bad. It could be a metallic or petroleum based odor. They are made in China, which makes me wonder if the coating could be lead based paint, since they are brightly colored. I do not recommend these hangers to anyone, especially people with young children."
5,I love him even more....,"If you are a fan, you will really enjoy this up close and personal performance. His velvet voice reaches beyond the screen and right into the room with you. A Must have for your collection."
4,"Wine,My Woman,and a Great Performance","This was outstanding, my wife and I watch it twice the first night. We have also shared it with friends who share our view as well. Wish the little boy showed more emotion, but the audience made up for him. I recommend this to all Valentinos who want to have that special night with their senoritas"
3,Different But Decent,"I knew almost nothing about LinkedIn before watching this disk. Disk does not play on TV DVD's; only on computers. I learned a lot. A lot I did not need. It covers areas from all sides. How to find a job, how to post an ad advertising a job. It may be too much information for most people. Oh yeah the videos are listed on left side of screen (unlike typical DVD). You click on chapter and video plays. You can only play one chapter at a time. This is why I gave it 3 stars but it does have a lot of information. Probably more than you will need."
1,Irredeemably boring and corny,"SPOILERS FOLLOWFaerie Tale Theatre's ""The Princess Who Had Never Laughed"" is very, very bad. Starring Ellen Barkin, Howard Hesseman and Howie Mandel, it tells a bland story with worn-out humor that is old the first time one hears it.An extremely serious king, played by Hesseman, has forbidden laughter in his kingdom and condemns his daughter to constant study. The kingdom's comical rebel, affectionately known as 'Weinerhead' Waldo, goes on his silly way oblivious of the king's disapproval. Frankly, though, the jokes Howie Mandel tells are so cheesy that it's hard to see where he's breaking any rules. Through an unlikely and dull series of events, Mandel's Waldo ends up plying his shtick for the king and princess, played nicely by Ellen Barkin.It pains me to write this review because I do appreciate much of the other work produced featuring Hesseman, Barkin, and Mandel but this Faerie Tale Theatre episode should have never seen the light of day."
1,So disappointed,I love power acoustik but with these I do not know what happen I got my tweeters the next day I opened them and the tweeters had rust on it and it smelled like it had been over powered I was very disappointed and they didn't sound good at all I think they just repackaged the tweeters
3,bad wiring,"sound alright for the money, one of mine quit working due to wiring issues...not worth the time to deal with product replacement. just remember you get what you pay for."
2,"Don't know how to feel, wouldn't buy again.","I played them loud and within the first ten minutes the right one blew, I had them as replacements for my tweeters on a component setup. The cross overs should have protected them even more but not the case. I haven't replaced them, I just don't listen so loud anymore. Bottom line is you get what you pay for. I threw the package away and for ten dollars didn't bother with the return."
1,Not Good,"One reviewer suggested attaching a set of components or caps to make these tweeters work correctly. I have tried every variation of proper mf. cap to try to set these straight. The sound changes, but nothing stops the incredibly awful hum and distortion these put out. The second you unplug them, everything sounds better again."
5,Awesome Tweeters !!!,Put these in a 2001 Chevy Silverado and the sound is fantastic !!! Great sound for the money !!!
3,ok,"Cheap price, they would of gotten a 1 star if i was just setting them up without being able to tune them with my head-unit. They will kill your ears if u set them up with a stock hu."
1,Shot in the dark,Just installed on motorcycle and they don't work. Very low muffled sound. Almost like they were blown before I got them. There are no instructions or markings showing which pre-installed wire is + or -. So I tried them both ways before turning up the volume. Neither way worked. Just bad speakers. Take a chance if you want. I won't again.
2,Terrible,"These are horrible, no matter what I set my crossover at. They catch highs and hang, they elevate s's, and it sounds terrible. Buy some quality ones."
5,You can buy this book for only $18,You can buy this book for only $18 at the author's own website. Fascinating Womanhood was her first book and is Excellent.I am appalled that people are trying to get $50 or more for an $18 book and want to make sure that others know it is available for less with a little more searching. Just search for the name of her first book and put a net behind it : ) I believe that Helen Andelin died in 2009 and her son has taken over the business.
5,Air America Secrets Revealed!,"If you want to know what really happened in Laos during the Vietnam conflict from someone who was really there, this book is exactly what you need. A no-nonsense, naked account of a CIA pilot's wartime life, both in combat and off-duty. The real Air America, in vivid pictures and words, straight from the horses mouth."
3,Not Damaged.,"Okay, this disc is a showcase of what happened to Black Flag. Two years after Damaged was released, Black Flag, along with Henry Rollins, released their record My War. The first three tracks are good, and ""I Can't Decide"" is one of my favorites by them. Then songs like ""I Love You"" and ""Swinging Man"" are kind of cheesy. ""Forever Time"" is okay. Then suddenly ""Nothing Left Inside"", ""Three Nights"" and ""Scream"" are epic and rediculously boring long s**tty six minute long tracks. My opinion, by Damaged or Nervous Breakdown."
4,pretty good,"well if it wasn't for the first two songs, id probably give this one 2 stars. 1-6 are good. Punk rock with a lot to say. the rest are just depressing slow songs that run for way too long (with Henry rollins screaming and moaning into a microphone as if hes dying) When i first heard this i only listened to 1& 2, my favorite songs on the album. until i had the time to listen to the whole album, i thought this was black Flag's best cd yet. the first 6 songs make up for its flaws though. i think it was still worth getting. before getting this get ""Damaged"" first."
3,"the ""new direction"" Black Flag","This was the first album that sent Black Flag in a ""new direction"". Musically more planned out and aggressive then basic 3 chord punk like their previous releases. Tracks 1-5 are the best tracks on here , but after that the album gets dull and boring. It's ok"
1,gimme a break......,"this album sucked when it came out,and doesnt fair much better 20 years later -really,really thin and crappy production also doesnt help the lackluster songwriting.if you are seeking out a ""hardcore"" album by one of it's founding fathers,dont start here...."
3,half of this album is great,"Black Flag's first new recording in two years is the first to cross-over the band into metal territory. Longer solos, less speed, and a growing experimental jazz influence knock this band out of the straight punk category. The first half of the album is excellent, with raging anthems ""My War"", ""I Love You"", ""Can't Decide"" and ""Beat My Head Against the Wall"". But then the second half of the album descends into utter sloth, possibly the slowest, most agonizing attempt at Black Sabbath imitation ever. Listen to the first five songs, then cut it off."
5,"""My War!""","""My war, you're one of them!"" Henry Rollins fires the first volly on Black Flag's final effort to rally it's fans against conformity.With tracks like ""Can't Decide,"" ""My War,"" ""Forever Time,"" ""I Love You"" and ""Swinging Man"" It is side 1 that truly makes this Black Flag operating within their finest hour because you can hear where Henry Rollins was going. The Rollins era of Black Flag needs to seriously be revisited by all Black Flag fans who have not done so already. Read, ""Get In The Van"" and listen to the Rollins era again and you'll be asking what I've been ask ing for the last 10 years when is Black Flag going to get nominated for the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame? All Black Flag albums had anthems or an anthem to give their fan's a reason to live to fight another day in search of a better tomorrow!"
4,A mangled second sublimity,"Yes, this is not the white hot peak of DAMAGED, ah well, of course, yet this psychodrama of fornicating rhythms and joltsand blastings is a close second, and really, from only the lasttwo songs: THREE NIGHTS and SCREAM are among the best things ever vomited by the great Ginn & riotous Rollins; even SCREAM alone is worth the price of admission.Clearly Flipper had influenced these songs, as well as the song Damaged, and Flipper's GENERIC---probably the greatest album ever made after 1980---combined with Damaged, and with this album, likely constitute the zenith of civilization in the late 20th century---O pity the poor youth today, blathering feminist & Judeo-Christian sickness, keeping their legs and minds closed, just saying NO to every form of pleasure, and worrying about their avarice-leaden ""careers."" As Henry says: ""I'm supposed be mature/I'm supposed to act my age.."" ohhhhhhhh yeah."
3,2nd step review,"Our kitten did not like this as well as the KMR milk replacement powder. Also this powder did not dissolve or mix with the water as well as the milk replacement powder. I'd stick to the KMR milk replacement and by the time you would think of buying the 2nd step, the kitten will be drinking water."
4,Pretty good,"I'm currently in the process of weaning my 6 week old baby, Jean-Luc. He wasn't interested in just having his formula in a dish, but when I started mixing some of this in he started to slurp it up after a little coaxing. It was so cute to see his little whiskers all messy!He seems to like this product well enough, and is happy enough to have several servings of his ""kitten gruel"" each day.Hints if you're having trouble weaning your baby off formula: try sprinkling some ground up dry kitten food on top (Jean-Luc really liked the smell of it by the pieces were too big...a pinch of it powdered on the gruel was enough for him to stick his nose in and realize he liked it) or try breaking up a treat on top."
5,Great Book for the average Joe!,"Another good book in the Master Visually series. Even as a computer tech I found this book very informative. The average non-geek computer user out there will find plenty of ways to tune and tweak their machine without doing any harm to the computer or themselves. Just follow basic instructions. Most high end techies will find this book pretty basic but it is a book I can recommend to my clients. I'm not a book reviewer but once again it can be said that ""a picture is worth a thousand words""!"
2,review,"just not i was looking for.needed a more simpler book.one that takes ms step by step.good ref throught, just not for me"
1,Rip OFF - Thieves!!!!!!! B E W A R E,A $ 3.50 item cost $ 98 to ship 2nd DAY!!!! I NEVER asked for 2 day asked for partial refund - NO!!! WILL NEVER EVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN!!!! Did NOT need in 2 days. I ordered end of April & stil have the item go give as a gift in JUNE!....B U Y E R B E W A R E......
5,MJ Plate Holder,I was looking for a stand for my Michael Jackson decorative plate and the stores I went to didn't have any stands which was a surprise. I then went to Amazon. com and saw exactly what I was looking for. The plate arrived in good condition and my MJ plate looks beautiful on it. When friends come into my home they love the plate and the stand. It looks beautiful together. Great value. I enjoy shopping at Amazon.com.
4,Nice plate holder,"Bought couple of 6"" & 12"" plate holders after reading other reviews. They are as nice as described, but one of them has some minor scratches. I am happy with them, they definitely do not look cheap. But the shipping is fairly expensive since they are really light. The shipping label shows less than $5.00 shipping and I was charged over $14.00. Consider the items received are with quality and saving the trouble of physically hunting them among different stores, I think it's worth it."
3,well...,"It's a decent book. I think David Frum has a bit of an ego problem, though, because some of the things he writes about seem unlikely to have happened for someone who was hired as an economic speechwriter. If you're looking for a book to really learn about President Bush, there are definitely better ones out there."
1,is the author selectively blind?,All you have to do is look at the shape this country is in to know that the author has not been honest in his appraisal of this president.
2,Davie's Bushwhacked is a better book,"Although Frum's book is interesting and fairly entertaining, it falls short of offering a thorough critique of Bush's actions.Instead, it plays the role of cheer-leader, pumping up Bush's very limited abilities and glossing over his embarassing lack of diplomacy and statesmanship.Frankly, a much better book on this topic is Bushwhacked by Michael B. Davie - but only if you're interested in a balanced, insightful and analytical look at the world's most powerful individual."
4,GRAP - Good Read for those with Ambiguous Personalities,"This is the best photograph a reader can have of GWB. Frum has done a good job with this book, with great amount of details and aspects of the current presidency. GWB is the sort of person one can admire or not, difficult to find a middle ground due to his strong and defined personality. He is a man that knows what execution means and the implicit costs that that carries. At the end, you can determine the quality of a person by the caliber of his/her enemies. As with many other good presidents, in the US and other countries, we will see the very good results of this presidency in the long run."
1,The Right Man? AN EDUCATED VIEW,"THIS IS A A QUICK REVIEW FOR A BOOK THAT CARRIES NO WATER!!i thought the author- david frum- ignored all the complications and ill business choices that were ignored during bush's run for govenor of texas in the 1990's. also, mr. frum's inability to present the 'other side' of bush when he ran for the presidency; his rocky past with business affairs as well as his inexperience in foreign affairs- these matters have come back to haunt us today, by both economic and diplomatic areas .overall, this book is very one-sided, it left me asking more questions than ever about our president: is he the right man for the job? could we (the american people) have picked a better person for the most important position in the free world?"
2,"Comment of ""Objective & Accurate"" reviewer.","The review written by Kyle ...should not be used as a deciding factor when purchasing this book. The Junto Society claims to be ""a place where you can depend on learning the facts, not the political spin on the issues"" however the website is so ultra-conservative in content that there is nothing left but spin. They ""encourage you to sign the petitions that we support on this site, and to email your representatives regarding upcoming votes"". How is that a place where you can depend on learning the facts without political spin when only one viewpoint is given?As for the book, I don't think anyone will come away with the notion that George Jr. is anything more than they thought he was before reading the book. It's not an in-depth study of the man or the office. How can anyone decide that Jr. is ""The Right Man"" based on this book? Simple. They can't. This book would be more useful on your coffee table as a coaster instead of reading material."
3,Great bk. Also read Careers In Computer Graphics & Animation,This book is good. Also read Gardner's guide to colleges. Gardner's guide to animation scriptwriting.
1,Nonsense,"Truly, this book is mindless propoganda:""George W. Bush was hardly the obvious man for the job"" why was this? And really, are we to expect any sense from the man who wrote the speech portraying North Korea as part of the axis of evil - a move which pushed N. Korea to throw out UN inspectors and develop nuclear weapons.Moronic."
1,Islamphobic,"I read the book and found it, especially in the chapter ""religion of peace"", to be full of Islamophobia. There is a difference between being conservative and islamophobic, which is equivalent to anti-Semitism. But, then one should not forget this is a book written by the coiner of the ""Axis of Evil"" phrase. Also I frankly doubt the credibility of Jewish writers wanting to tell us about Islam and Moslems, because if i wanted to learn more about the Jews I wont pick a German writer! Especially if a German writer is telling us about all the wrong things with Jews and their culture."
4,A great behind the scenes account!,"I am about finished with this excellent book! I have enjoyed it for many reasons. Being a member of the military and having some idea of media relations, speech writing and our government , I find it fascinating to read about the ""behind the scenes"" details of the workings of the White House. A truthful book about such things during other presidencies would be just as interesting I believe. I hope that many who are both for and against George Bush will read this book with an open mind! Great job David Frum!"
4,"The Right Man, and the Right Book.","The hype of this book was nothing more than hype. Don't get me wrong, this book was excellent and gave you an almost true inside look on how the west wing works, but falls short of the complete insider's view. The best part of this book, it gives the names you hear everyday a character that the news cannot deliver to you. You find out how Karen Hughes acts and feels, and how the administration works, from the no marijuana after college rule, to the suit colors Bush makes his staffers wear. This book is a very interesting one to read and you fall right into it."
4,Good book from great author!,This was a well-read book from a man questioning Bush's leadership prior to September 11. A great read from an interesting perspective.
5,Unflinching Portrait of a Great Man,"The thing that impresses me most about this book is the way David Frum doesn't shy away from telling about the unpleasant things that happened during Bush's first six months in the White House. Looking back now, it is hard to remember a time when Bush appeared weak and somewhat powerless, but during the first part of his presidency, that's where he seemed to be. Tragic as they were, the 9/11 events are what turned around Bush's presidency and where he found his definition as a true leader--the first President to be a real leader since the '80s!Reading this book has helped me to appreciate our President even more than I did before. He is a real human who makes real mistakes (like all of us) and isn't afraid to own up to them and try to come out a better person for it."
1,Is there a 0 star?,"I can't believe that an average person who doesn't know the danger of Idealism can be elected to being the President of this country in the first place. It is even more surprising to see an author to mix up religious issues with political issues in a country which is supposedly having the most educated people on earth. Why would an author become so demagogic and take much advantage from pubilc ignorance and linguistic embellishment to praise this President who only cares about tax cut that would benefit the rich people? Aren't these problems obvious enough? Is he the right man? Definitely yes for rich people. Is the author blind, or does he think that the readers are blind? I can't believe that so many sheeps think that it is a good book."
2,Nothing Much New...Skip It,"This book was a dissappointment: the recipe seems to be one part rehash of news events during the first 2 years of Bush's presidency plus one part bland observations of a White House insider plus just a dash of insightful rationale to support the title. Regretfully the book's most interesting parts (such as they are) are the author's first hand accounts about himself: his being asked to be a speechwriter, what happened to him on 9/11, his departure from the White House inaccurately reported by one of the cable networks. One might forgive the author for spending so much time discussing himself rather than the title character if only he had provided some genuine insight into the inner workings of the White House, but what few tidbits that are provided are few and far between. If you want to revisit the headlines during Bush's first 2 years, this book provides a decent summary otherwise its an unfulfilling appetizer without an entree."
3,Of the 2 former Bush speechwriters' books,"I liked Matthew Scully's ""Dominion"" better. While I enjoyed Frum's book I didn't see anything really new or exciting behind the West Wing closed door. On the other hand Scully's book will change your life!!"
1,Right for what? Armageddon?,"What a joke! It is almost laughable if it weren't for the fact that this country is going down the tubes led by the so-called ""patriots."" Bush has always been a failure in every endeavour he has undertaken. From school to the oil business to managing a ball team to Governor. The man cannot even address the nation with bumbling his words and making little to no sense, yet this makes him 'right'? Ha! The only right thing he has done is finally coming forth and admitting that iraq had nothing to do with 9/11."
2,nothing new here,"unfortunately, I share the opinion above. there is nothing new here. Frum is a very skilled writer. But he didn't have much to say here. too bad."
1,Bush is CERTAINLY not a good president.,"George W. Bush is NOT a good president at all. Look at our current deficit of 400+ Billion Dollars. Look at the fact that Bush based a whole war on 1 piece of faulty intelligence that the CIA was completely divided over. Bush took us into Iraq because he said that Saddam had tons of illegal weapons and lots of uranium. Rumsfeld said there was overwhelming evidence. Bush was wrong. Now Iraq is in a horrible state of affairs, with looting, rapes, and complete instability. More GIs are dying by the day. And Bush goes and yells ""Bring em on!"". This is NOT a 50s Western. Real people are dying. I don't think Bush can understand that. That is why he is not a good president."
3,Great bk. Also read Gardner's Guide to Careers In Animation,This book is good. Also read Gardner's guide to colleges. Gardner's guide to animation scriptwriting.
4,Taking the Gospel Message to the Managalasi People of Papua New Guinea,"""Poking Holes in the Darkness"" is the story of Jim and Judy (Jaki) Parlier's work as Bible translators among the Managalasi Indians in the Jungle of Papua New Guinea.In a first person narrative Jaki highlights the progression of nineteen years of life among the Managalasi's from her perspective; the adjustments she faced and the challenge of adapting to the culture of a Stone Age people group, steeped in animism, in fear of spirits, with no written language.Jaki's writing is candid and genuine, sometimes funny, always rich with insight; a simple telling of her spiritual struggles, her faith walk, and filled with heartwarming stories of individual Managalasis.""Poking Holes in the Darkness"" is packed with emotion, eliciting deep feelings of empathy, identifying with Jaki's loneliness and impatience, her joys and victories, and her grief and sorrow. A remarkable story...highly recommended."
4,Great but not her best,"I am a huge fan of Patricia Veryan, and The Riddle of the Lost Lover is consistent with her great work of the past. She has written better, but this book was enjoyable nonetheless. The plot was exciting, the romance was sweet, and I couldn't put the book down until the end. I love Toby and Paige! They are typical examples of Ms. Veryan's sparkling humor and wit. I hope they get their own books eventually. All in all, I really enjoyed this book."
3,A satisfying ending...,"Finally, the long-awaited sequel to Riddle of Alabaster Royal. This book was written in the typical Veryan style with wit, danger, and, of course, romance but I found myself wondering where the humor had gone! I found it for the most part to be in the character of Pierre, de Coligny's little boy but I couldn't find it in too many other places. I'm glad Jack's problems were resolved and the plot definitely offered some surprises. I have read everything Ms. Veryan has written and will continue to read them as they come."
2,Not nearly as good as the smaller versions.,Just received two stacked together in a big shipping box. The outside item was cracked at two corners from the top to the bottom. I have purchased three of the two size down and two of the one size down and they all arrived intact and seem to be a lot sturdier. This size wobbles when you pick it up. I would not purchase these again but the smaller one I would buy more. I have had the three two-size smaller ones for about a month and really love them.
1,Not much of a revision,"I was surprised to see that this revision contained very little additional or revised information. During my travels up north, for example, I found in several cases that certain lodgings that had been shut for several years still appeared in the ""new"" edition. Coupled with other dated or inaccurate information, it appears that the authors actually visited and researched few of the locations that were off the beaten track. It is almost as though Lonely Planet have cornered the travel book market for Thailand, and there is little incentive to put a great deal of effort into the new revisions, since it appears that nearly everyone going to Thailand buys the LP guide anyway."
3,Could have been better,My friend and I took the Lonely planet and the Let's go travel book with us to Thailand. We found Let's go a lot easier to use. Lonely planets' index was useless causing time wasted while hunting through the book looking for info. Let's Go Thailand had better maps and was easier to follow all around.
2,Skip This One,"Sometimes, I think Lonely Planet has become so popular on the backpacking set that no one even questions its substance.When I was in Thailand, people referred to this as their ""Bible"", an incredible overstatement. It isn't that the information was wrong, just incomplete when it seemed to matter.I think there are other guidebooks that offer better information, even though budget travellers are made to believe it is the only series for them. Shop around before you buy this."
2,"Not a ""Bible""","I agree with some of the other customer review that this ""guide"" is far from one of the best. The information is sometimes wrong (unfortunately at the most inconvenient of times). In addition the book is hardly a ""guide"". The walking tours, for example, give you little information and simply plop you at a site. This is more of a handbook to accommpany a map. The book seems to inspire the kind of tourism where one looks, but does not realy try to understand the culture around you. The worst part about this book is that it is not arranged well. Each area you visit is arranged by ""activity"" like accommodation or food. This is particularly annoying in the Bangkok section, where one has to constantly flip from section to section in order to figure out anything about where you are in the area of town you are visiting. On the positive side, the recommendations of accomodation are decent. Overall though, I recommend to get another guide. Lonely planet has gone lazy."
5,Another Lonely Planet Success,"As most of the LP books, this one is a good guide. It offers you from a good review of the history of the place, places to eat, warnings and even parties dates.The pages don't wear off easily, and it can be bent in your daypack with no problem.Definetly it's a ""must"" if you want a guide-book in thailand."
5,Red Laser is Great,I just got mine and pointed it after dark out into the woods.. easy to put a dot on a tree a few hundred feet away. This is a very good laser Going to try some prisms with it.
2,Don't Cha Wish This CD would get banned,"Ok, OK maybe not banned, but this certaintly won't be in the kiddie section. I being young myself of course did NOT buy this CD. Why? Cause it's discgracefully inappropriate! 'Don't Cha' is basically about a girl teasing a guy cause his girlfriend ain't 'hot' like her. It's a rediculous song and yet EVERYONE loves it. Why? I guess because they are all bad like that. The ONLY song worth listening to is stickwitu which is the ONLY song that is decent from them!! Other than that i would have giving this album 0 stars if i could. So in other words, this is NOT a album for Kids! And would you know they tried to make dalls for the Pussycat Dolls? HAHAHAHA, but the parents were like NOOO!"
1,"AKR, you are forgiven","In fact, we both give this one star, and that's all that really matters, as long as no one s**ts on my opinion. Oh well, that's what makes the world go 'round!As for PCD, I'm too lazy to review it, I'll post here tomorrow."
1,"To pete ""snake""","Cool your head dude...how can you be a christian and curse so much?? and i see you also like iron maiden? they have some demonic looking artwork on some of thier albums...and calling people fags aren't very christian likeand i listen to some of those songs that you recommended and they are good...may i recommend that you check out some songs by michael w smith, crystal lewis and nicole mullen...have you heard ""redeemer"" by her?...its nice"
1,"To pete ""snake""",its cool man...sorry about the bad comments i made about you...just be careful with iron maiden their music isn't all that good for christians...i'm a christian as well and sometimes i listen to music i shouldn't be listening too...like PCD...anyways its all cool.
3,"To pete 'snake""",i bet you are one of those guys who dress in black and walk around like you know music and always insulting everyone that doesn't like your taste in music...while secretly you listen to britney spears while you are alone at home in your mother's basement...you're the fag!
4,i give it ok,even though there's only one girl singin it was pretty decent i mean beep is a good song but just to many beeps that's anoying i don't know what advice i should give well go buy you will not be disapointed if i like it then you have to like it pcd forever
1,Do people really think these chicks are empowering????,"Seriously? Come on. For real? People have actually given this piece of garbage of an album 5 stars? And they truly believe these skanks are empowering? What has happened in our culture that crap like this passes as music? In one breath, they're trying to steal a man away from another woman, convincing the guy that they're ""hot"" and ""raw"" and in another breath they're saying how they wanna stick with the guy they're with forever. I just don't get it. How can you be a total man stealing whore one minute (and completely full of yourself while doing it I might add) and then the next you want to be the loving faithful girlfriend who wants a long lasting relationship? Their singing abilities are average at best, and if they weren't half naked all the time, bending over chairs, thrashing around like wild animals, and singing about how sexy and hot they were, nobody would be paying attention to this garbage. This is the epidomy of why sex sells."
3,Fast Beat,"It's not one of my favorite cd's, but it's good if you're on the treadmill or working out. It has a fast beat to pretty much all the songs."
4,Not what they initially seem,"Some people assume things about this group that are just not true. Yes, these girls somewhat rely on their sex appeal to give them a fan base, however their songs attract women, and are not completely distasteful. Their songs put women first, unlike copycats of theirs who use sex appeal in both their look and their lyrics to turn everyone off. Christina Applegate was the actress who initially stuck with the Pussycat Dolls when they were still a burlesque group, and other actresses like Pamela and Carmen merely passed through to get their chance to become a part of the Pussycat Dolls for a short time, not to fuel their image."
3,Just what I expected,There are no big suprises it's pure PCD style. The first songs are well known by charts and the others are also quite good except of the Tainted love cover which I don't like that much.The Album is kind of old now and it's time for a new one.
4,Fun Girl Music,"So the PCD are not the Beatles. They don't claim to be. This music is fun booty shakin music that should not be taken too seriously. Its fun for a girls roadtrip to Vegas. Its fun, mindless music and thats all it is."
5,the spice girls of today,"All of these girls have their own look to them, and no two members are the same. Nicole is the lead vocalist, and the other five are backup singers. I feel that she is the only Doll whose voice is good, because she is the only one on here who sings. I really like this CD. This album features remakes of Donna Summer's ""Hot Stuff (I Want You Back)"" and Soft Cell's ""Tainted Love/Where Did Our Love Go"". Along with PCD's Don't Cha featuring Busta Rhymes, Beep featuring Will.I.Am, and Stickwitu. Also has songs that sound a lot like Broadway (I think they are). This album gets better song after song, andI think if you buy this cd, Don't Cha, Stickwitu, and Beep won't be your favourite on the album. I guarantee you're going to love it."
1,"weak album, don't buy it","weak album, don't buy it. From the first track to the last you feel there's a lot missing to make this an o.k. album."
2,PCD is a little played out.,"I used to like this album, when it first came out. But know its just so boring, and the lead vocalist Nicole's voice is so annoying. I only like ""Right Now"", ""Bite the Dust"", and ""Feelin' Good"". The Pussycat Dolls are a little boring now, and they cannot perform live good."
2,THEY SHOULD STOP!,"I dont like any of these songs except ""Stickwitu""It's very pretty and actually has nice lyrics. I'm not putting them down like hatred but these girls are 30 yr old woman trying to sound like 20 and 18 year old.This should be there last album they make."
2,People give this 5 stars? Why?,I think that if you are going to use a drum machine it would be a good idea to learn to use the tempo key. The first eight songs all played at the same speed making it seem like I was listening to one really long boring song with lame lyrics. I'm sure the videos must be better as this group must rely on the T and A factor. It is also a shame to remake songs worse then they originally were as this group does on several occassions. But there must always be a plus side for every action so here is my attempt for wasting the $14.00. The disc does make a good drink coaster.
4,PCD takes away the stress,"PCD is an overall good CD that will get your mind off of things and take away the stress. Most of the songs are updated versions of the 80's classics with some interplay. I always enjoy listening to the songs because it's edgy and upbeat. 'Tainted Love', 'Wait A Minute', and 'Stickwitu' will be favorites. If you're a girl and you get all your girlfriends together, play this CD because you'll all end up singing to it. All songs bring out the eccletic vocals and sassiness PCD has to offer."
1,RUBBISH,"Piss on this trash, ""Don't Cha"" is the stupidest song to hit top 40 radio this decade which is REALLY saying something considering the absolute BS that is modern music. And to think,10-15 years ago musical inspiration had reached a zenith with bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Oasis, Blur, Pulp, Stone Temple Pilots, Sublime, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, The Verve, Radiohead, R.E.M, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More, Janes Addiction and many, many more...god how i miss those times"
3,It's ashamed Nicole Scherzinger is so HOT but an't nothing but a big tease!,"I love this band the pussycat dolls they are really talentive and they are pretty hot. The song ""Don't Cha"" is my favorite one cause it's a dance song that really gets me going I do wish my girlfriend was hot like them. The song ""Must stick with you"" is them showing their more mellow side and not always have so much energy. ""Busta Rhymes"" and ""The Black Eye Peas"" are in some of thease songs on this ablum. Now this is what I hate about Nicole Scherzinger. The song ""I don't need a man"" I'm affended by that like she's too good for us men and the song ""Beep"" she's saying she turned so many guys down cause all they want is her @$$ well what she expect she looks good. Nicole Scherzinger should go back to ""Eden's Crush""."
2,What's with all the covers?!?!?,"Catchy tunes, but what's with all the covers??? And tainted love? Man that just doesn't sound right!!! The lyrics seem very shallow from what I've heard, especially don't cha (or however they spell it :s ) lol, anyway, if ya just lookin for a couple of fun tunes to dance to this seems ok :)"
4,At first,"When i listened to the first song ""Don't Cha"". I wasnt really feeling PCD at all. Its still not one of my favorite songs by them even with Busta on the record. But after hearing ""Stickwitu"". I was like okay, maybe i should give them a chance. Then came ""Beep"" i was feeling the song from the outset and the video is on point as well. Especially the beat. Then ""Buttons"" with Snoop Dogg after that. I was like i'll go ahead and take the plunge. I really like the cd overall. There are a couple other songs that i like on the CD. Including ""Wait a Minute""."
1,Don't cha wish that they would stop?,"I am a 12-year old and yes, everyone listens to this record in my age. But I think the Pussycat Dolls have no talent. All they can do is showing of their bodys and doing Sex-Songs. I mean, just listen to the text: ""I don't give a 'beep'/ Keep looking at my 'beep'/Cause it won't mean a thing if you're looking at my 'Beep'"" or this one: ""Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me"" This is just really gross! I don't understand how you can give THIS 5 stars."
1,COME ON!!,"This music right here is a perfect example of showing just how far down music has gone in the past few years. Stickwitu you have got to be kidding me!!""stickwitu"" not even a word and when I first heard it I was utterly disgusted and said to myself because teenagers are just used to this crap they call music these days this will be a hit. Absolutely atrocious!!"
1,Wow...this is awful,"If you are dumb enough to buy this crap then you probably are not smart enough to read and comprehend the English language. Therefore writing a review that captures how awful this is, is most likely a waste of time. But here it goes. Given the state of low quality, overproduced crap that currently litters the airwaves, this is at the bottom of the barrel."
1,Why is anyone suprised?,"Sex sells - this is a fact in American culture. But why is everyone so suprised that a lack of talent has made its way into the music industry? This has been going on for ages. Recall Milli Vanilli - their good looks marketed music that they weren't singing. Apparently, it was thought that the original singer wasn't handsome enough to sell the music.As far as a lack of talent goes, this applies for many artists in the hip hop and pop industries. With today's technology, an artist needn't be able to carry a tune or sing in harmony - the machines will do it for them. As long as the background beat is catchy, Americans will buy.Still appalled? Boycott bad singers and don't buy their albums. Let's start with The Pussycat Dolls and Britany Spears."
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...Girls who gave up spice for a bit of milk...Pussycat's are not a new manufactured idea, and at times they are a wee bit o' fun. But a whole album it doesn't make."
4,this is a pretty good CD,"The PCD CD is good, but i didnt expect it to sound so much like a musical. to me it sounds like a broadway show thats what held me back from giving it 5 stars,but not every song sounds like that, as you can tell by the ones on the radio, but its a good CD because they actually sing good and have good beats. my favorite songs arebeepwait a minutestickwitu& I dont need a man.the PCD's stick out from other girl groups. normally they would sound like little barbie dolls singing, but not these girls, u cant compare them to anyone else. their sound is unique, so buy this CD if u think u like what ur hearing. dont listen to those BAD reviews because they are just jealous. u wont be sorry...i wasnt anyways"
3,Not all songs worked,I love the songs but my absolute fav song is buttons & it doesnt work during the whole song. It skips on multiple songs. I dont need a man and stickwitu
4,Songs grow on you,"I like the 1st, Don't Cha Feat- Busta Rhymes, and 4th track, Stickwitu, the best. For some unknown reason, my 4 1/2 year old likes the 5th track, Buttons, and makes me play it over and over again in the car when I drop her off to preschool. The other tracks have grown on me as I've played them."
5,Sassy,"I really love PCD's cd. Its a fun cd to listen to while crusing down the road! While its mostly very upbeat, there are a couple of slow tunes, too."
2,freaks of the week,boy these girls got the looks but not too much else going for them reminds me of some spice girls wannabes they could have did this and they would have had comeback album of 2005. they should have made out more they would have gotten more sales.
4,Shockingly Good,I actually like the CD. I'm really glad I bought it. I assumed it would be a pop-girl band album but it actually sounds good. The tracks are fun to dance to and the singers are quite talented.
5,Suprisingly GREAT debut!,"WOW! First word that comes to mind! This is a superb and very solid debut. I was wondering if & when they were coming out with a full length CD and I could not be happier that they did. I am not even going to mention ""Don't Cha"" simply because everyone on the planet knows it and I think everyone on the planet is sick of it!!! LOLThis CD is the best mixture of R&B;, dance, Pop and Hop/Hop. The songs are catchy, the lyrics are catchy and the voices are catchy and memorable. Maybe a few too many samples but it actually works in their favor and does not go too overboard.It is one of the best CD's I have gotten in a while. I kindof had this preconceived notion that they could possibly be a one hit wonder but every song on here seems hit worthy.All songs are stand out tracks - but MY favorites are: ""Buttons"", ""Beep"", ""Right Now"", ""Wait A Minute""Go out and purchase......Promise you will be pleased."
3,Great if you're into this sort of thing...,"I am all for having a good time I really am. I just don't know if this cd can do it for me.I bought this and I will use it to work out, but not for much more. I just didn't have the soul, depth, or creativity I look for in an album(yeah, I said album, what you gonna do?). There is something to be said about 'artists', 'musicians', as opposed to 'performers' and 'entertainers'. They usually don't have the depth to keep me as a follower.I liked 'don't cha', 'beep' and 'buttons'. Mainly because they are a little sensual and I can work out to them.My tastes vary off the beaten path so I should have known mainstream isn't the place for me. If I get to annoyed with this, the beaten path of a truck will be where this cd goes."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Do not and I mean do NOT support this so called group. What happened to the days where women wrote deep down, emotional feelings in their songs and didn't use MTV to sell their music? So don't be surprised when all these girls are found working at a strip club soon in your town. Who in the hell told them they can sing in the first place? So avoid like Britney Spears, J. Lo,Trina, Lil Kim, and so on. If you want a female artist(s) who writes great music and don't use crap a** lyrics, get Aretha, Chaka, Diana Ross, Mary J. Blige, Toni Braxton, Whitney Houston, Tina Turner, or Janet's Velvet Rope album (though it's sad how she uses her image more...but it's still a great album)"
5,A Great Album,"Every on as heard Don't Cha on the radio and if you liked that you won't be disapointed by the PCD album. The vocals are great and so is the beat. I'm not a huge fan of the original tainted love song, but I do love the PCD's version. The album is all about fun and the girl's realy can sing."
3,"Decent CD, hot women","If I could only rate this CD based on the looks of the women, then it would be a five, however, I'm rating the music on the CD. I rated them average because they only have a couple hit songs, namely ""stickwitu,"" and ""don't cha,"" and most of the other songs are not really that good. Just like most CD's, you'll just like a couple songs and thats it. What they do remind you of is the Spice Girls, just a little hotter version of them, and a little better songs."
5,Nothing but goodness,"This album is fun all wrapped up. The album is full of good song after good song. Their remakes of Hot Stuff and Tainted Love/Where Did Our Love Go are both superb and really do justice to the originals. These girls are more then just hot looks and steamy videos, Nicole and the rest show how they have a great pair of lungs that can belt it. Whether you want a bouncy tune like Beep or a sweet song like Stickwitu, it is all right here. You can't buy this cd without finding a few songs that you will love."
1,Pathetic,Where do i start? First of all the lyrics are just dirty. Second of all This is the worst pop music i have heard and trust me i have heard some bad pop music. What is this music teaching are society? I see little 10 years old buying this junk. And who is the record company letting them record this? Oh by the way they have incorrect grammer on the track list notice stickwitu. Its funny to hear how pathetic they really are. So what a good laugh? Listen to them.
1,PCD album review,"I have only once anything so bad in all my life, and that is Madonna's new album Confessions On A Dancefloor!They are ugly and have no talent"
1,Didn't the Spice Girls Break up?,"People still buy this garbage? WHY? Dont you realize that you could spend your 15 bucks better, like you could buy 15 Spice Girls albums, since they are all in the bargin bin, and thats where these Women will be in a few years. They are easy on the eyes, but not on the ears. Save you money. Wait for a reunion of New Kids on the Block."
5,Didn't expect somethin' like this!,"Don't Cha - 20/10 My mother even likes this one! Great song.Beep - 9/10 It is a good song. Will.I.Am didn't do his best.Wait A Minute - 7/10 Not my favoriteStickwitu - 1,000,000/10 Wow! This is the best album on the track!Buttons - 8.5/10 I liked the beats, but the lyrics aren't so good.I Don't Need A Man - 9/10 Its great.Hot Stuff (I Want You Back) - 9/10 Decent song.How Many Times, How Many Lies - 10/10 This is a great song.Bite The Dust - 8/10 Not the best.Right Now - 7/10 Could have done better.Tainted Love/Where Did Our Love Go - 9.5/10 Great song.Feelin' Good - 8/10 This is okay.PCD was a very good album. We will be hearing more from the Pussycat Dolls. The beats were great to dance to, this is a very great album I have in my collection.~Waffle~ Music lover"
4,Better than I thought!,"I bought the album having only heard the hit ""Don't cha"" but I quickly found myself won over by the whole album. It's filled with catchy danceable music.""feelin good"" Is a standout as a really good song. I have the whole album playing in my MP3 player all the time!"
1,even you can make millions!,"It's really not the Pussycat Dolls or their songs that bother me. There's been worse pop music. It's me that bothers me. I'm disappointed in myself that so far I haven't I haven't been able to think up a scheme, like this group, to make millions off the vast number of idiots out there. Could you imagine the producers of this group and the girls sitting around in an expensive hotel room laughing their butts off rolling around in the dough saying: ""can you believe this!?! ahahahaa! I knew there were tons of gullbile idiots out there but I didn't think they'd fall for this again!! cheers!"" (clink sound of champagne glasses)I mean I'd call them marketing geniuses but really it's so obvious you wouldn't think it would work these days. Make a group consisting of ""hot"" girls and throw in some manufactured tunes and ""sexy"" lyrics. Boom. Millions.Oh well...off to work on my plan. Hmmmm we haven't had a boy band around in awhile..."
1,PCD=Overpaid adult entertainers,That's really all there is to them. They can't sing and their music and music videos look and all sound the same.
2,"Hot, but I wish I could say the same for the music","First of all, the only ""Doll"" who even sings is Nicole. She isn't a great talent but her hottness and good beats cover it up. Most of the songs are just about sex mainly for the guys. If you are looking for something to play in a club, it would be great, but not good music"
1,80's style vibe with a up-date of the Spice Girls,"good safe musical Eye-candy that is short on musical substance,but catchy on a Hook or something to get your ears.""Don't Cha"" is there bread&butter cut. they have Novelty written all over them,but every few years a act like them makes some noise&then it's off to working the drive thru Window at Mcdonalds so enjoy it for now because I ain't expecting them to last."
3,TO THE PRODUCERS OF PCD: DROP THE OTHER GIRLS AND PROMOTE NICOLE!!!,"My young niece had this CD, at first I thought, just another flash in the pan like, What was their name? Spice Girls right? Anyway, I think lead singer Nicole Scherzinger is pretty, has a nice singing voice and is a good dancer.That's why I believe the producers/promoters, should just drop the other not even qute five flash dancers and promote Nicole Scherzinger as a solo artist. Even though she looks more like Shelia E. (female drummer in Prince NPG band in the late 80's) she has the style, a sexy image and potential to be the next Beyonce, Aaliyah, Janet, J-lo, Vanity, Madonna whoever."
2,Not that great,"I heard them do their one song on Dick Clark's New Year Eve special a year ago, so I bought this on impulse. A disappointment. Oh, well, it'll happen when you're trying to get out of the 70's."
4,Don't Judge this the same way...,"Okay, let's get this out of the way: this isn't a disc you're going to judge at the same level of most other albums. the purpose of the Pussycat Dolls is most definitely NOT to wow you with their vocal ability and deep, meaningful lyrics. But more importantly, just to have a little bit of FUN. Is it so wrong to have a group that isn't out to prove anything? They have a good time singing about female empowerment. They bring girls a positive message that hasn't been out there with the Paris Hiltons of the world running around. Sure, they dress risque, but they just want to show men that while they are beautiful, they aren't going to be taken advantage of. Highlights are the singles plus ""Buttons"". Just listen, and don't think so hard."
2,Just good. (2.5 Stars),"1) Don't Cha- Catchy and edgy, but the rhythm is too plain. 7/10.*2) Beep- Catchy, but gets extremely boring after a few listens. 6/10.*3) Wait A Minute- Slick, yet almost-boring. 7/10.**4) Stickwitu- Sweet, but again plain. 7/10.***5) Buttons- Very sexy and slick. 9/10.6) Don't Need A Man- Just okay (filler). 6/10.****7) Hot Stuff- Again, just okay. 6/10.****8) How Many Times- Boring (filler). 5/10.***9) Bite The Dust- Good. 7/10.**10) Right Now- Just lazy (filler). 5/10.*****11) Tainted / Where...- Near-horrendous. 4/10.12) Feelin' Good- Again, horrendous. 4/10.*****73/120 - 61%: **1/2"
2,If You Go for Style Over Substance...,"Choose this.If you go for substance over style, perhaps not this.There's no denying the invaluable drink-coaster use of this CD though. Buy it if your ""Chronicles of Life and Death"" finally gave way under the Martini."
5,A masterpiece,"This album is perfection. These lovely ladies are incredibly talented, great singers, and fantastic dancers. ""PCD"" is the world's best debut since Britney's ""...Baby One More Time."" Pink Floyd, move over. The Dolls are here!"
1,Stay away,"If you're learning to use Maya, this is NOT the book for you. from the get-go, the instructions are NOT clear on what they want you to do. The Solar System was a few pages and it took me 3 weeks to do it because I had so much trouble. They tell you to rotate things but they don't say by how much or what direction. and they leave you in the cold. Stay away. Now I may be hasty because I'm learning maya myself, but this book is NOT helping."
5,Introducing Maya 8,"I've been toying with Maya for several years but never abie to get my head around it. That is until I discovered Introducing Maya 8. Lucid, Logical and even Entertaining. Dariush Derakshani's macabre sense of humor makes it a great read as well as a valualble learning experience. The tutorial projects are easy to follow and immediately present practical application which is lacking in most of the books I've tried to read on Maya. I was actually excited to move through the chapters with a growing confidence in my beginning mastery over Maya. I come from Painting and 2D compositing and was able to readily grasp the ""nodal"" approach which had eluded me with other dry Maya texts. Finally, a book which allows a 2D brain a transplant into 3D. If you want to quickly move into 3D with a fun and witty teacher..get Introducing Maya 8."
5,great book for learning 3D,"This book is by far the most user-friendly beginner's guide to Maya I've come across. It begins assuming no knowledge of 3D apps, and works it's way into some pretty sophisticated stuff concerning texturing, anmimation, modeling, etc. I think the key to it is the writing, which is peppered with smart humor which is well-timed. It reads like taking a class with an engaging young teacher, totally knowledgable yet fun. Highly recommend."
4,Wonderful!,"I may be biased since I spent a weekend at a folk string-a-long with David Schnaufer as one of my instructors but I grabed this CD that weekend and as time went on got a few others of his. He shows us how very versital the dulcimer is and that it is not restricted to just mountain folk music. He plays along with an orchestra, swing, blues, some jassy tunes, etc. It was a pleasure hearing him in person and I can relive his performance and teaching through his CD. I do recomend this recording to anyone who loves music!"
5,The Guide to Dog Survival,"This is a no nonsense concise guide for training and rehabilitating an agressive dog and also their owner. Pam Dennison gives precise step by step positive training techniques that will create a lasting bond between human and dog. It is a must read for the agressive dog owner, but is also common sense training for any dog owner. Her use of positive reinforcement of good behavior rather than punishment for bad will make many dogs' lives happier. Her suggestion to keep a daily log of training is a great tool and she supplies a template. I've already seen great results using her techniques with both my dogs. This is a must read for all dog lovers, easy to read, and full of valuable information and insight."
1,not what I expected,"It took the author 4 YEARS to rehabilitate her dog using her method, and its easy to understand why. Nowhere in this book are you taught how to nurture trust and respect from your dog. The advice on training specific commands is worth reading, but probably not what most people that buy this book are looking for. The books I bought after reading this one were so much better. I would highly recommend the books by Patricia McConnell instead. Her 'How to be a Pack Leader' booklet is awesome and sets the stage for success with her other books, Feisty Fido and the Cautious Canine."
2,How to Right a Dog Gone Wrong,"Book is decently written and information logically presented. However, it does not really provide adequate details for application of techniques. It indicates that basic obedience is the fundamental method of correcting dogs who show aggression, but does not give adequate in-depth specifics to support the title's promise."
5,Abby's the best!,"This book is the best, since Abby's the best baby-sitter! I really miss her in the new series, Friends Forever! I wish that there was a real person like Abby, so I could meet her! Please write some more regular BSC books, Ann, I really miss Abby!"
4,Very Good case for the money,"This Guitar case is very good case for the money, if almost any acoustic guitars. good seller. paded meterial, easy to carry around the guitar in this bookbag type case."
5,Bag,Very good fast service. The bag is perfect fits really good and the pouch in front holds all my stuff thanks.
2,you get what you pay for,"i got this bag after reading a couple of psitive reviews on it, i dont know what i was thinking, do not get ths bag, unless you just want to protect your guitar from dust, it offers no protectiono your guitar investment, padding is so thin it almost not existing"
5,Perfect for my needs,"Just got my new bag today - fast shipping, came in good condition. I was surprised and pleased that the bag is roomy enough for me to insert a little extra padding of my own if I want it for my smaller guitar, yet has ample room for my larger guitar. The straps are great for carrying - easy on my back... Highly recommend this gig bag."
4,like it,"could have been a little more padded, but it works for the purpose gets meback an forth from my lessons."
4,Good!,"My son was excited to get this. It was a bit bigger than what I expected, but he loves it. Good quality."
4,"Death of Satan, Life of Evil","Delblanco brings up many good points in this extremely controversial book: Satan has not died, people simply dont fear him as they used to; why should we when we can blame each other. Evil is a human act. The work of the Devil is everywhere, but no one knows where to find him. Delblanco is very precise and unbiased, although; real evil did exist in Germany during the holocaust, Delblanco dosent blame any one race for evil, but states that evil is the only way for humans to deal with life. Men need to place the blame on somebody, and throughout the ages it has become harder and harder to blame it on an idea like the devil: why not, simply, blame it on someone of another race? Overall this was a very good read, although, it can slow down tremendoulsly, the overall thesis is very easy to believe, and rather scary to think about."
3,who is to blame?,"This book was obviously titled to sell books and not explain what the book is about. First the book talks about the history of slavery in the United States. The author seems to talk forever about slavery. From this point the author talks in circles about the blame game. Since our society does not believe in the devil as we once did, we have diseases and disfunctions to blame for the evil we do. The author is right in his presumption that people people look for and need a scapegoat. The author argues that satan served as one easy scapegoat for all that is wrong with the world. The rules of socirty have went askew since Satan died. As a result the author argues we hunger to get the devil back. Because the book talks in circles for so long about the same vaguely realted points, I would only recommend this book as a paperweight or a reference for hardcore fans on the subject. It is merely stating what most already know."
4,Basic Stuff,I liked the book but expected more. I've been in the work place for about 10 years and wouldn't recommend it for someone like myself. This book is ideal for a recent high school or college graduate.
2,Over British Columbia,"I was disappointed in this project. I have other ""Over"" travelogs, and they are quite nice, thus I bought this one.The voice and it's dialog are irritating to listen to. Grandiose speaking in a whispery manner, giving little actual information. Frankly I was glad that there were some unvocal spots in the video.The photography is great as usual. If I watch this again, I will do so with the sound off, and my own music playing."
3,"Fine content, mediocre quality","This 1996 production is not up to current high-definition video standard, and the audio soundtrack is 2 channel stereo. It's a disappointment as a Blu-Ray disc."
1,in a blue zone?,"After purchasing several videos on a recent trip to USA and enjoying them at our home, I was eagerly awaiting these products --- but they wont play here in OZ. Can it be that you market internationally some products designed only to work on the USA DVD system - not international? I thought that problem was only for video tapes?"
5,"Brutal, yet melodic","As it's been mentioned by other reviewers, this is an amazing album. I don't even remember how I stumbled onto Misery Signals, but I'm very glad I did. The best way I can describe this band is to say that they mix hardcore vocals (without cheesy HC lyrics), complex heavy, yet melodic riffs, and pummeling DB drumming to produce a progressive, Hopesfall meets hardcore type sound. Actually, the slight similarity to old Hopesfall is what really attracted me. The best part about Misery Signals is that they cannot be easily compared to anyone else!If you're looking for something crushing, monstrous, yet simultaneously beautiful, pick this CD up. It's a breath of fresh air amongst other bands in the stagnating metalcore scene.""One Day I'll Stay Home"" and ""The Failsafe"" are worth the price of the CD alone. Amazing songs."
3,Updating required,this author was just on the karel-andrew show on KFI 640AM in LA about her book & you show it is out of print?
5,Excellent CD,"Personally, I think this is a splendid CD. It highlights many old favorites from Disney, including most of my favorites, such as Part of Your World (one of my favorites) and Beauty and the Beast. Julie Andrews and I have much in common, apparently. This is an excellent source to get favorites, personally selected by someone who knows her Disney.Contrary to what many are saying, if you actually pay attention to the title of the CD, you are able to tell that this is just a collection of favorites, not actual favorites. If you were so compelled to buy the CD and eager to hear Julie Andrew's sing, then you would know that she is unable to produce such a project like this. (Hence the ""selects"", not sings.)All in all, if you're looking for a CD to revisit your favorite highlights, this is the one. Definetly worth the price (though that's not very high)."
1,Just another compilation album,"I totally misunderstood the description of this CD. I expected Julie Andrews to be singing her choices of Disney hits. Instead, these are the songs from the soundtracks of the original movies. So, if you are a Disney fan as I am, you probably have most of these exact tracks in your collection.For some different arrangements of Disney classics, check out ""Wishes!"". Bette Midler singing ""Baby Mine"" is lovely, as is Tony Bennett singing ""The Bare Necessities""."
5,Masterpiece,"For Julie Andrews rabid fans it's something to behold, a rarest of all rare. It is a cd that I thought would never come to light. WE're still waiting for ""Rose_Marie"", ""Julie and Carol At Lincoln Center"", ""JUlie Andrews Live At Osaka"" and ""Love Me Tender"" to be released as cds. I wonder if Sepia records couldn't do something about that..."
2,It might be very imformative,"once you get past all of the man bashing. I agree that women are natural healers and inclined to such. But have mercy... I was offended in the most hilarious way. The offensive part is obvious almost immediately. The hilarious part (in all of it's irony) is that she's so closed minded in a field that takes a very open mind to practice with success. I think our dear author might have some healing of her own left to do. None of us are perfect, not myself for sure but I couldn't really get into her teachings. Her prejudges make her hard to take seriously."
3,"Great, but could it be any more separtist?","If you can get past all the separtist language in this book, you can find all sorts of good advice on natural healing techniques. I have practiced some of them, and they work wonderfully...I recommend it to anyone wanting to get into natural healing, if you can get past all the separtist language and the hostility she displays towards men"
3,I do love her view on the Nature of women,"But I have to agree she is a bit overboard when she speaks of men. But I do love the way she speaks of the past times when in order to birth, you simply asked a friend with children to be your midwife. I do believe that people could benifit from that kind of knowlege now. But overall she is rather hostile, taking feminism to a whole new level, I believe she has some unresolved men issues."
1,Troubled mind disquised as Informatiive,This book like most of Diane Stein's publications is filled with half truths and obvious unfounded bias against men. While she does provide some helfpul information her statements following them and Her pontifications that men have caused all the the evil and harm in the world belies her offerings as healings. She evens demonstates an obvious hostility towards dogs. What information she does present is so skewed and reworked to justify her intense dislike for a great many entities in the world that it does little to promote any of her socalled nautral healing. Her refusal to recognize that women are part of the humanity and that men are not less than human is untenable and shameful for someone purporting to teach natural healing. We are all healers and we all should be both men and women
2,Pure Intentions and Technique are Important,"Ms. Stein needs to overcome her bias towards men. This bias is found in many if not all of her books. So you would have to read this book and make an effort to ignore her ego-attitude towards male human beings.For those who want to tap in their mystical powers for service to others(Love) and not for themselves(Ego) check out The Lightworkers Way by Doreen Virtue. I and a friend of mine both agree that her teachings, intentions and techniques are purer and guard against the voice of our egos or lesser-selves."
1,My grandson didn't like it,"As we started reading this book to my 4-year old grandson, he made a face and said in a disturbed tone, ""I don't like this book."" Maybe the cubism turned him off."
5,packs a punch,"This little book has so much information in it...i was very impressed. it was more of an overview of information without getting too in depth. the book pointed me to other resources to look into more. The writing was very interesting, not boring."
4,The Secret terrorist,This book was shipped used and was in excellent condition. This book is very educational on the true course of history as it related to the new world order.
1,"Have you no shame, Mr. Vedder?","I'll admit it, back in the early days, I was a real big fan of Peal Jam. They rocked, and , more importantly, they stood up for those less fortunate than middle America. Than I head the song 'Daughter' and I learned that Eddie didn't have sympathy for at least one disadvantaged group in America: The mentally handicapped. On that track he cruelly and heartlessly mocks the vocal affectations of those with mental disabilities, just to get a cheap laugh. I'll admit it, his impression is dead on: He totally sounds like a 'tard. But is it really appropriate to mock the mentally handicapped, particularly when one is involved in so many fashionable, liberal causes? Well, no. The time for fratboy humor is over, Mr. Vedder."
3,A good pre-trip read,"We bought this slender book before taking our 4 kids on a trip to London and wanted reading material that would give them a sense of the place; it's an overview of the major sites loosely tied together with a mystery narrative. It also contains a list of about 20 must-sees described from the point of view of Robin, the fictional narrator; also a glossary of British slang terms. It's not great fiction, but it's a good starting place for kids wanting to know more about modern London. I wish the 2 kids in the story (ages 12 and 14) were more enthusiastic about the places they visited... they give the impression that London is a stodgy place through which their parents drag them... but it all comes out right in the end."
3,learn the formal first,"I think that the course is only an introduction to the Korean language. It is good for that and no more. After having been in Korea for 2 years myself, it might help you to know that you will get a lot further learning the formal way to speak, that is, the more traditional longer form, than you would by using casual korean. Koreans are highly polite in everyday situations, they will be more welcoming to a foreigner who can use the traditional way of speaking first most. The course focuses on that well. Drawbacks are the price and the expectancy to repeat long phrases at times, overall though you should be able to get some benefit from it."
2,promises pie in the sky but delivers very little,"I agree with the reader from New Zealand: these tapes is for beginners. Most of the material on these tapes I learned my first year in Korea.The product comes with a brochure, telling the consumer all about how wonderful the product is and what a brilliant scholar Dr. Pimsleur is. According to this brochure, ""extensive research has shown that we actually need a comparatively limited number of words to be able to communicate effectively in any language."" That is not true. According to a word frequency chart compiled at Yonsei University in Seoul, it takes 3000 words to read 85% of written Korean. It takes 6000 to raise that to 90%.If you want listening practice and adequate grammar instruction in the same package, your best bet might be Elementary Korean by Ross King and Sae-Hoon Yeon, ISBN 0804820791."
3,The female mumbles through half her words,I've gone through half the CDs so far. The male voices come through clearly. But the female voice....I am still not sure what she's saying half the time.
3,History rather than cooking,"I simply bought this book expecting some mouth watering knish and blintzes recepies, lox and herring and you name it... real jewish foods. Instead, the author collected whatever the Jewish people ate, whether it belongs to the Jewish cuisine or not.. I mean ""TABBOULEH"" ??? and since when was Hummus or Kibbe a Jewish cuisine??It will take a lot of time to go through all of this, but if it is ""just Jewish cuisine"" you are looking for, this book is not for you. I gave the author 3 stars though, based on the ""literature and history"" information in each chapter. But then it is a cook book not a history book that I wanted. At $7 , used, it is fine... No more than that. And by the way, perhaps I missed it, but this book does not have ONE picture in it... Don't you love seeing what you are / will be eating ??"
1,"Modern Welding ""LAB MANUAL""","BEWARE The ""LABORATORY Manual"" is just a book of TEST FORM'S with no answers. 350+ pages of questions. It's probably fine ,if all you want is a book of TEST QUESTIONS. This is EASY to explain in a brief caption in a sales paragraph , since this is not at all mentioned ,and is followed with the review's of the real,,useful,books,,I feel this is just ""PLAIN FALSE ADVERTISING"""
3,Why is the year and revision not on the front cover?,"I bought the hardcover and this workbook that goes along with it (or so I tohught). It turns out the workbook and the hardcover books have been released, modified, and re-released over the years. I have a 2004 hardcover and a 2000 workbook. The workbook has questions that aren't covered in the hardcover.I am annoyed because I now have to hunt down a 2004 workbook to match my 2004 hardcover. I have to hand in these tests from the workbook for class. What makes it hard to track down (over the internet) is the cover doesn't tell you which book you are ordering. Neither does any description I can find.This would never have been a problem if these books followed a standard (like other books) of making it obvious on the cover which revision of the book you are buying."
2,Hannibal: Enemy of Rome,"Have you ever had someone try to explain something, and you don't understand it? Well, in the book, Hannibal: Enemy of Rome, has a very similar situation. The book sort of gives you two different stories.The author goes through the same adventure as Hannibal when he was a live. That can make the story very confusing because you have a mind set of reading about Hannibal instead of reading what the author went through. The book was very interesting when I read about what Hannibal and his men went through during the war. Also, the author uses very difficult vocabulary, and was very difficult for me because vocabulary is not my strong suit.Over all, the book wouldn't have been that bad if the author didn't write some much about what he went through. I think that if he wrote my about Hannibal that there be more interest in the reading the book. In my opinion, Hannibal would have been an awesome book, if it followed the title."
1,"Not Punk, Pointless.","If you're looking for Black Flag music, this isn't the album for you. This is spoken word and instrumental. Yep, I missed that on the cover when I purchased the album and regretted it.The spoken word might have a few nuggets of gold in it, but not enough to buy the album or continually listen. The instrumentals aren't good enough to stand alone. Plus, I believe in the immortal words of MC5: ""Kick out the Jams,..."" Punk was the answer to self serving instrumental pieces like the ones that fill the last half of this album. This album reaffirms my belief that artists shouldn't break boundaries just to break them. It usually results in mediocre art.For the die hard Black Flag fans, embrace this album. I'm not trying to stop you. For music fans, avoid this album. It's pointless."
2,what the hell?,"when i bought this i wasn't expecting to hear boring instrumental music , and rollin's beatneck poetry. Black Flag is a good band but their musicianship isn't very good , especially to put out instrumental songs. buy some of the others like First Four Years , My War , and Everything Went Black instead"
5,Author of Out Of Focus...Again/Freelance Writer,"I loved this book, and purchased copies to be used by each of my children as they raise their children. I made a point of showing it to my four oldest grandchildren, ages 11, 9 and 7, who were all excited about a book I brought for them on money. I know that it made them feel not grown up, but also motivated them to read Smart- Money Moves for Kids for ideas that they can use themselves. As a former teacher I believe that one of the biggest mistakes parents make about their children is that they disregard the fact that children are quite capable if we allow them to be. It's important that the adults in their lives not only treat them with respect by soliciting their ideas, but also provide guidance for them as they learn about making important decisions about finances.Smart-Money Moves for Kids is always a great gift for children as well as for their parents. Expectant parents would appreciate copies as well."
2,Does not find my Motorola phone,"I have tried everything to get this software to find my phone, It wont find my contacts or allow me to do anything using the software. Motorola has been of no help either. I guess this is just another one that does not work with some phones. Mine is listed as one that is compatible with my Motorola W385 Verizon phone.Wish it did work. I wanted to be able to use my phone as a modem on occasion and to back up and add contacts."
2,"Great for doing backups of contact list, not for customizing phone","This is the basic software for the cellular phone. It was easy to install and had an easy interface to use it. It will copy all your contact to your PC or to another Motorola cell phone. Or you can transfer your contacts from the PC to your phone. You can make changes on your PC and the phone will accept it.The LAN cable connection isn't great and would disconnect often. You can only use the LAN cable that is supplied too, you can't use another.You can't add music or pictures to your phone using this version of the software. You do have the option to pay for the better version which isn't worth it to add photos or music. Motorola has placed a lot of restrictions on this software and their cell phones."
2,Wrong model delivered,"I ordered an Okidata B6300N, but I received an Okidata B6300. The ""N"" is very important because it stands for ""Networking.""The printer I received is not networkable. Only the B6300N is networkable.Usually products are correct on Amazon, so I am surprised they screwed this up. Now time to send it back. Furthermore this printer did not include a toner cartridge, which costs more than $100. :("
4,Ian Ballantine,"He is a great vibraphonist and I like this cd and the tunes. I feel that he rushes thru them a little, which is why I eft the 5th star off, but, it is really hard to find solo vibraphone cd's, this one is well worth hearing, and, he really does play very good."
4,Deep Fried Desert Grissle!,"I'm an Arizona native and these guys used to throw oranges at my friend when he walked to school. Although they kind of drifted off into obscurity after their last real hit ""backwater"" in mid-ninties, this album is their crowning achievement. Amazing that it's now 20 years old and still continues to delight and confound those who discover it.Oh yeah - reviewer Janitor X is a complete moron. He also gave Pavement's Crooked Rain and the Pixies Doolittle album one star.He's one of those idiots you see driving a datsun pickup blaring Mastadon out the window. It must be weird to be retarded but not know it, huh?"
5,"Better than Nirvana, even Nirvana would agree to that! Buy!!","I first picked this up in a 2nd hand record shop awhile back having heard nothing but Nirvanas Meat Puppets covers. For about 2 months afterwards, this CD was all I could listen to, I still listen to it regularly. the fast solos and sincere vocals made me feel more alive than any other CD ever has. The lyrics are witty and the vocals are beautifully sloppy especially the harmonies (i assume) between the two brothers. The songs range from really short country punk ('Split myself in two' and 'New gods') to psychedelic rock-ish instrunmentals (aurora borealis). The bonus tracks particularly (the naieve sounding)'What to do' and 'Teenagers' (a crazy punk noise-fest that turns into one of the most atmospheric pieces of music you ever heard) are not to be missed."
5,"all right boys, let's get way out there now","You will either find this unlistenable, or it will instantly become one of your favorite albums of all time. If the former, go listen again. one day you will get it.p.s. best road trip music ever made."
2,I don't get it.....,"After attending a Dinosaur Jr. gig a few weeks ago, a buddy of mine got into talking about how great the Meat Puppets were/are. Now that was one band that somehow I missed during the SST glory days, so I decided to pick up this one and ""Up on the Sun"" to check them out. Uhh, well, just what IS all the fuss about? This doesn't rock at all, there's no decent hooks or songcraft, I played it once and will probably never play it again. Other contemporary stuff of the day, say for example ""New Day Rising"", just smokes this, as well as the above mentioned Dino Jr. Very disappointing...if you want to rock, look elsewhere."
3,Meat Puppets II,Pretty good CD. I like the original tracks found on this that Nirvana covered on their Live From New York album
3,rather listen to nirvanas,"This is pretty good, im not a fan of all there songs though, And i would definetly rather listen to nirvanas covers of there songs on there unplugged cd. Some of these reviews anoy me, for instance, futhermucker, a person who probally listens to good charlotte. I recmomend this to big fans of them...there decent"
5,Great reading!!!,"This was a great book. I read it in 3 days. I had a hard time putting it down. Hary Constance told an honest and personal account of his life and experiances in Vietnam, the Navy, and at home."
1,Brute But No Brains! Does Not Have The Right Stuff!!,"Here they go again, another Navy SEAL trying to glorify their day's done by with more John Wayne type adventure stories, with no real substance. When are these guys going to get it? Just becauce they can jump out of a plane, shoot a gun, or swim a little further than the adverage GI Joe, they think they can write a book. Not all SEAL's have the RIGHT STUFF to author a book, and surely Harry Constance has proven this to us time and again, in Good To Go. It takes brains, and not just any military brute to tell a good war story. This book is loaded with so many inconsistencies it was hard to follow. I agreed with reviewer, Dave Clough from Chicago that there was no flow from chapter to chapter, just a bunch of war stories. Don't waste your money on this one, rather go out and rent the GI Jane video with Demi Moore for a better night of Navy SEAL entertainment."
1,ANOTHER BORING FICTIONAL ENCOUNTER OF VIETNAM,"This book had terrible writing and I have to agree that it was just another glorified war story (or stories, since they didn't flow). How many times do we have to hear about the trials and tribulations of the VietNam war? And more so, who cares about these Navy Seals? Move on with your lives and quit boring us with the dreary details. This was nothing more than a work of fiction with the facade of fact. Can anyone write a book these days? Apparently so."
5,A fascinating and yet troubling account of war and politics,"Through the actual accounts of a very special person, the reader is given an eye-opening glimps of how our finest unsung heros affected the war and how the war affected them. Told in a graphic and yet at times entertaining way, this book should be required reading for anyone who really wants to know what Vietnam was like."
3,"I Love Myself, I'm a SEAL","Once again here we go with an I love myself SEAL story. It started off on a good note but about half way it got repetitive. The story almost mirror-imaged Richard Marcinko's ""Rogue Warrier."" (Who can tell the biggest fish story.) I give him credit and respect for being there and serving our country, but the story got to the point that the reader knew who was going to be the hero on any given operation.I was looking for something with more substance and depth and all I got was just another action hero clone"
5,"Honest, Strightforward, brought back good times & bad times","The book is well written and puts you right in the middle of what was going on. I spent five tours in Nam and the stories shared in the book are correct. How do I know ? I was there. The book was easy reading and flowed from one story to the next. For the reader from Seattle if you do not wish to hear about the trials and tribulations of the VietNam war why did you read the book? Who cares about these Navy SEAL's? Anyone who fought side by side with them and a lot of other warriors who would have ended up as POW's if not for the actions of SEAL's, Marine Recon and Army Green Barets. From your comments it's easy to see how you feel about VETERANS Of Foreign WARS. There is only three reasons a persons such as yourself makes commits such as you have. 1. You are a wanna-be who never had the sand to do anything. 2. A SEAL took your wife or girlfriend away from you,or 3. Somewhere, someplace a SEAL adjusted your attitude."
5,FOR THE REAL STORY ON NAM-READ THIS BOOK!!!!,"HARRY CONSTANCE LETS YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST. HE TAKES YOU ON A ROLLERCOASTER RIDE WITH ALL THE UPS AND THE DOWNS!! HIS EXPERIENCE IN THE TET OFFENSIVE WAS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!! THIS WAS A HARD BOOK TO PUT DOWN, I WAS UPSET WHEN I FINISHED IT. TRY THE BOOK-YOU WON'T BE LET DOWN."
5,the book is action packed.,"good to go,is a true account of a navy seal. it is a book filled with action. telling you stories, of a pont man in vietnam. if you like miltary history books. then you will love good to go."
3,This book is for an intermediate practitioner not an advanced one,"I bought this book thinking it would show some really challenging poses that i can't yet do. There were some ""extreme"" poses, but for the most part it wasn't worth the money I spent. However if you are an intermediate practitioner looking for a challenge then this book is for you, but if you already can do scorpion, legs behind the head, King pigeon, etc. then i would have you just get B.K.S. Iyengar's Light on Yoga or Dharma Mitra' Poster or book. There are more challenging postures in these books than in this one."
3,good but could be better,"I agree with the reviewer who wanted to give this 2.5 stars.This is an interesting book, and the topic it covers is one that needs to be addressed: a detailed analysis and instruction of intermediate andadvanced asanas.The book includes some photos of the asanas, and it includes an explaination of the position and how to get into it.Unfortunately, it only includes a few pictures. I wish the author had included more pictures, including pictures of the different stages as the yogi/yoginis enter the picture. ""Troubleshooting"" information would also be useful. The book should be about 50% longer. It's not a bad book; it just needs more detail and more pictures.Still, it's good for inspiration."
3,A little drawn out,why are we taking so long to profile the stories of the people in the book? No real direction of where things are headed (or how many more books we will have to buy!) entertaining nevertheless.
4,I liked it,"Well I have to say that I really liked this book. I won't go into the plot, enough others have done that. This is the second in what should be a series of 4, with the next coming out in July, I believe. This series will stand up by itself, or you can also read Guns of the South and How Few Remain, which can also stand alone or make an excellent continuation. Guns is of course in a different universe, but we can't have everything. The only problem I have with the book is that there are large number of characters spread across the entire continent. The problem becomes trying to keep track of who is on which side and where they are at. I wish a list of characters were included, or each section began by telling the date and location of characters. But as I said we can't have everything, but then again (I have to brag) I do have an autographed copy."
4,"""Another Winner By The Master Of AH""","As usual, Turtledove does an excellent job showing us this alternate WWI through the eyes of his diverse characters. Not only do we see the actual fighting, but we see what goes on behind the lines. Canadians living under U.S. rule, working women dealing with rationing and Western Union death notices and a Socialist woman doing what she can to end the war. The Confederates also have a major problem besides the USA. The blacks in the South have begun a full-scale Socialist Revolution. Turtledove also shows off new inventions thrown into the war, such as flamethrowers and tanks (called barrels by the USA) No matter what side of the conflict his characters are on or what their beliefs are, they are written in such a way that you can't help but care about them."
4,This book was too long!!!!!,Harry Turtledove takes too long to get to the point. That I have to read two more books to get to the end of the war is to much! Otherwise if you like alternative history pick this book up.
4,"Better than the first volume, but still slow moving.","I have to admit I was underwhelmed with the first volume, but this second installment is much better. I think that the number of characters is still to large and there are a number of implausible events and strategic circumstances. (Living up here in North Dakota, I can't believe the USA hasn't taken Winnipeg in two years. After all, its only 80 miles from the US border across some of the flattest and most wide open terrain in the world!)That said, this book and series is a rip roaring yarn. Just be ready to suspend some disbelief. AND THE USA BETTER WIN!"
2,"Stop with the plot shifts, I'm getting dizzy!","I like Turtledove, but the method he employs in this series, changing from subplot to subplot every 2-3 pages is nauseating. Just trying to remember who's banging who (literally; sex is a central theme in all his books) is mind boggling. Just when I begin to remember the difference bewteen Captain Morrell and Sergeant Featherstone (and they keep changing rank as well) and the plot picks up in intensity, boom - it switches to some completely different subplot. It took me longer to read this book than the past 5 books I've read combined!"
5,Another 5 starrer from Harry,"If you like H. Turtledove, you will, of course, read his latest. If you don't like him, then you are out of luck. If you haven't read him, read one and you'll be hooked. So...get hooked...."
2,Disappointing,"Turtledove's The Great war: Walk in Hell has few virtues. It has poor character development and literally none that are sympathetic. Its treatment of blacks is particularly offensive. In Turtledove's world blacks are as despised in the north as they are in the south. Yet after being crushed in a Marxist rebellion, blacks are welcomed into the southern army where they flock to fight for the country that held them as chatel and continues to ruthlessly suppress them. The book does a disservice to the 100,000 blacks who fought for the north. Basically the book is an excuse to demean blacks and to use the n-word."
1,Same thing all over again,"I hate to give an author I like only one star, but this book is really only a copy of the first one. Yes the plot goes on - if you consider the many small story strings a plot. If instead of jumping back and forth between 15 different small plots which never touch, Turtledove had written 15 seperate stories, not one of them would be worth reading !!! As it is it is tolerable, but only because I hate leaving something unfinished."
4,A great sequel,"Harry Turtledove's Great War:Walk in Hell was an intriguing book. The writing was well worked and imaganitive. The reason I gave it 4 stars was the amount of unneccesary sex scenes. Other than that I liked it. Some of the other people thought the amount of characters was confusing but I found it helpfull, I could see all the aspects of war. There is an artilery commander, farmers, sailors and infantry. This shows how the war effects different parts of life. I thought that it would be interesting though if he could show how the war is going in Europe. Turtledove must have done a lot of research and it shows in the realism of this novel. I am anticipating the next part of this series, The Great War:Breakthroughs."
4,Good value,"This was bedding I sent to my son away at college who had forgotten his quilt. The whole group was only $31, and with super-saver shipping, it arrived within 5 days, delivered to his appartment. I had previously looked at Target and Kohl's for cheap quilts, but they don't offer free delivery like Amazon does, so I feel I got a great value with this."
1,Sweethearts Comforter,Never recieved item. They claimed it was not in stock after I purchased the item! Big Disappointment!
1,lousy quality and design,don't waste your money on lousy quality and design in Tommy Hilfiger bedding - not even worth it was free
3,fine addition to the FAERIE TALE THEATRE series,"RIP VAN WINKLE is a fine addition to the FAERIE TALE THEATRE series, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and starring Harry Dean Stanton in the titled role.Rip Van Winkle (Harry Dean Stanton) is a good man, he's just a too much of a dreamer is all. His wife Wilma (Talia Shire) has had just about enough of his loafing ways, the house is falling about their ears and there's no money.When Rip goes hunting in the forest he happens upon a group of ghosts, who offer him some of their stange green drink. Sleepy and confused, Rip sleeps away in the forest (for 20 years!).Once awake, Rip now finds himself in an entirely different world to that he knew only yesterday. What has happened to Rip Van Winkle?Featuring great performances from Roy Dotrice and Tim Conway. Harry Dean Stanton is suitably-bewildered in the title role, and Talia Shire has a ball as the frazzled Wilma."
4,Faerie Tale Theatre: Rip Van Winkle,"Atmospheric and delightful version of the Washington Irving classic from Faerie Tale Theatre. Francis Ford Coppola creates a spellbinding film with Harry Dean Stanton turning in a great performance as the man who liked to sleep alot! Talia Shire is wickedly funny as Rip's wife, Wilma. Alot of people probably think the same thing as I do, that the sets are a little too fake such as the sheet used for water when the goblins talk about their misfortunate shipwreck. Overall however, it's another excellent episode."
2,Not impressed,"I didn't feel that this adaptation of Irving's story stayed true enough to the original. The character development in the beginning was weak, and the encounter with Henry Hudson's crew was really stretched (unnecessarily). I was glad I didn't pay a lot of money for this."
5,Teach yourself visually,this is a book on windows xp and everything you ever wanted to know and how to do things with xp windows
5,Nice collection of classic games,Just what i was looking for 15 old school quarter eaters in your pocket.you can also record your glory moments and save them. Adjust the games to your level of play etc.I do hope they bring out a second one consider it bought if they do.
4,Great arcade classics,"If you are a retro gamer, or are too young to remember these games the first time round, then buy it. A bag load of classic arcade games from one of the best developers, Konami."
2,NOT MY TASTE!,"I am not culturally a SUGAR person, so all the rave reviews were a surprise to me after I tasted it. You have to be a SUGAR person to like it. Hot taste...nothing special."
3,no title,"Although nothing happened til page 133 of this 303 page book, after that it was pretty good, if overwritten as the style of the times dictated (1931). Actually, this could make a good movie, with striking visuals, especially if a little magical realism were used. It takes place mostly in and around Picadilly Circus, London, in the course of one evening in winter, sometime in the 1920s. As in all novels of the time, it dwells on the plight of the post-war soldier, the wildness of the times, lapses of morals, etc. John Osbourne is a very memorable character, as were the two Pengellys."
4,Rollins be awesome yoyooy,Wowowowo mad awesome cd... very very cool. this is what true punk is really is... Henry at his best. I love this album... if you love old school punk ... get this mad awesome
2,decent at it's best..,"Do you people actually listen to this album, or give it a good review because all of your heroes tell you to? Have any of you actually heard the REAL versions of these songs, or are you just talking out of your arse when you ramble about it's genius?If you like this tripe, do yourself a favour -- pick up ""Everything Went Black"" or ""The First Four Years"". Chavo, Dez and Keith do wonderful jobs of singing the songs written for (and sometimes by) them. Most people wouldn't put up with a bar band covering classic Black Flag, so why do they think that the third or fourth versions of some of these songs are so amazing?If you can't get over Rollins lust, check out ""My War"" and/or ""Loose Nut"", the two good albums from his stay in Black Flag. But ignore this almost worthless piece of plastic."
1,Punk Shmunk,"So what's the deal with this stuff anyway? Either it's just an act, or Rollins and company are VERY disturbed individuals.And it ain't music. It's just replusive, deviant anger mixed with noise."
1,junk,"Junk that people who know nothing about music, especially punk, hail as a masterpiece. All attitude and speed but no hint of a good sense of sound or how to write music, even for simple music. Black Flag was one of the bands that contributed to the down fall of punk rock. All image, attitude, speed, no talents like Henry Rollins, clothes, etc. all the superficial [stuff]that makes bands popular and famous. This album has no musical quality."
1,PUHLEASE,"MORE NONSENSE BY WANNA BE TOUGH GUY ROLLINS AND THE GANG. POSSIBLY THE WORST BAND EVER. STILL LAUGH OUT LOUD THINKING OF THAT ""TV PARTY"" VIDEO. THIS ONE OFFERS MORE MUSIC FOR THE POMPOUS JAGOFF WHO CAN'T FORM A THOUGHT FOR THEMSELF AND HANG OFF EVERY SPOKEN WORD THIS OLD KRUSTY PUNK CAN MUSTER. MORE DREK FOR THE STARBUCKS CROWD. YIKES."
5,The cream of the cream!,"This is one of the first hardcore records and simply the best! All the songs on it are real classics, espacially rise above, spray paint, six pack, tv party, room 13, depression, paded cell, life of pain and the two damaged songs! And Henry Rollins is at his best on this cd! Go Buy this right now!"
5,An Apotheosis of Punk,"There are records with lots of good songs on them. And then there are records that so perfectly articulate what ""rock and roll"" is supposed to mean that normal praise seems asinine.I've played this record when I saw no point in living - wallowing in its frustration and pain. I've played this record when I was too ecstatic to sit still - exulting in its raw power. Take it as a measure of its greatness that ""Damaged"" spoke to me with equal eloquence on both occasions.If you've ever been young, if you've ever felt alone, if you've ever been angry, if you've ever dared to hope in the face of powerlessness, this is *your* music. Play it very, very loud."
5,My Tape Died,I had this album on tape for years. Now it is stretched beyond recognition. Black Flag will never get the credit they deserve ... How punk is THAT? Here they are at their most raw and powerful. Intensity thunders out from this record.
5,It Still Rocks After All These Years,"I first heard ""Damaged"" in the early 1980's and immediately became a Black Flag fan. I recently heard it again, and it still packs an angry punch. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to explore 80's punk/hardcore."
4,"It's not for everyone, but....","The Damaged album is one of the most intense pieces of music I've ever listened to. Uncompromising, vitriolic, crushing and thoughtful, Black Flag's first recording featuring Henry Rollins makes today's soft-sounding pop-punks sound like Bing Crosby.""Damaged"" is all about Greg Ginn's burning riffs blended with the lyrics that denounce social injustice, excess, laziness and every other by-product of taking the easy path. This record is not for everyone. Blink 182 and Green Day fans will probably crumple, whimpering, to the floor through ""Rise Above"", ""Police Story"", ""Depression"" and ""Room 13"".There are a few bands out there that have the same sound, but few have the relentless ability to stay true to their vision that Black Flag did when recording Damaged."
5,"Raw, powerful, amazing 80s harcore punk","This is definitely Black Flag's best cd ever. That says a lot, considering that Black Flag put out so many rockin albums. Damaged is full of energy and rawness that almost makes it sound like a live album. Thats one of my favorite things about Black Flag- the pure, unbridled energy....I wish I would've been alive to see these guys in concert. Anyway, my favorite tracks are 'Rise Above,' 'Six Pack,' 'Depression,' and in my opinion the best, ""TV Party.' The whole album is great, however, and its quite hard to pick out standout tracks when they are all so...good. Buy this album, if you are a fan of 80s punk like Bad Brains, Minor Threat, and the Dead Kennedys. And to all the Blink and Sum41 fans- sorry, but you need balls to listen to this rad album."
5,Quintessential Punk,"You CANNOT consider yourself to be a fan of punk rock without loving this album! It has everything:nihilistic themes, humor, fast, short songs, great guitar sound, and awesome, yelling vocals. Do yourself a favor and buy this album."
3,Somthin' Goin' On Here...,"While I've never been a big punk fan, I do enjoy this album. There just seems to be something more going on here, than on most punk albums.And if you are a big punk fan, don't use my rating as a guide, as you'll likely enjoy this much more than I did."
2,raw power ripoff,"This record is vastly overesteemed. Alright, I'll grant you Rise Above and Depression but the stuff in between isn't so hot. If you don't have it, get a copy of Raw Power by the Stooges instead. The songs are just as 'damaged' and violent but somehow extremely catchy."
4,"good, but flawed","Really this is more of a 3 and a half star. I'm sure you've heard all about this album before, with it being called one of punks greatest albums. It is good and it's definitely punk - fast, short songs and Henry Rollin's vocals are vicious and biting.However, there are flaws. One is the production - it's terrible. But that really doesn't matter because it adds to the punk spirit of the album. Overall this is an alright album and worth it just so you can have heard it. It's clever, and some songs, especially TV Party, have good points and can be pretty funny."
5,True Punk Rock,"This is definately one of the best punk rock albums ever by one of the best punk rock bands ever. All of the songs on this song are awesome-my favorites are ""What I See"", ""Gimme Gimme Gimme"", ""Spray Paint"", ""Damaged II"" but their all awesome! Black Flag hits incredibly hard--after I listened to this for the first time, I felt like I got hit in the face with a brick. Greg Ginn and Dez are awesome on guitars, and Rollins growls and screams out some really good lyrics. Also check out the First Four Years album for some earlier stuff, and My War, Wasted Again, etc. You should already have this!"
3,I've Had It,"I know I'm in the minority here, but I think Black Flag's pre-Rollins days were their best. Keith Morris delivered Ginn's lyrics with just the right sense of snottiness and wit so as to make their juvenile angst sound both funny and very honest. Rollins, on the other hand, plays it straight, bringing the band - and hardcore punk in general - dangerously close to self parody. There's a few stabs at out-and-out humor on ""Damaged"" and for the most part they're painful (there's no way anybody can honestly like something as stupid as ""T.V. Party,"" is there?). This album still gets 3 stars for songs like ""Rise Above,"" which capture some of the old magic in their blend of catchiness and brutality. Black Flag was the most physical of the big hardcore bands and you can definately hear that on this album's better moments. Still, I'd rather stick with their early work (it's collected on the compilation ""First Four Years"" if you're interested) or, better yet, Minor Threat."
2,"ok, but seriously overrated","this is proof that Rollins always took himself too seriously, and Ginn too. Get the first four years, chavo or dez cadena ""keep"" it more real, esp. Dez's damaged. My War is when they started getting in a good direction then lost it, imho. I remember getting this back in the day (94!) and being totally stoked, maybe if you want people to call you HC, then you have to get it, this album may be hard, but not it has no core"
3,Ok cd...,"Classic, Ok Cd. Henry Rollins anger clearly shows, My favorite is tv party and Rise Above(I prefer the Misfits Cover) Overall good American Punk/Hardcore. Anti-Everything.couple songs I like. It's interesting."
3,Damaged,"Yes this was a 5 star LP, but beware of the neutered CD version, being an old punk (37) I was around for the live and mind blowing LP versions of this band. It pains me to hear the weak CD qaulity of this ultimate roar..."
5,Damaged,"Damaged being Black Flag's debut album and 1981 and is a very aggresive album and showcases some of the best of hardcore punk. Songs that standout on this release are ""Rise Above"" , ""Police Story"" and ""Damaged I"". All the lyrics are included but not a list of who plays what. 5/5."
4,More anger and pain,"Damaged is....damaged! Urban angst, frustration, raw feeling all coiled up and ready to explode. Have to admit that ""TV Party"" must be the worst early Flag song! But the rest of the album is pure fury, chaos, and South Bay Los Angeles disgust. Highly recommended."
5,Absolutely Essential!,"The rawest, most visceral album ever made. A classic. It still makes me want to break stuff."
3,ESSENTIAL ? - not to me.,"This album is considered by many as the greatest hardcore/LA punk album ever made. To me it hasn't been a life-changing experience. Sure, there is the attitude and the energy that drives the best hardcore albums, but their musty sound and Rollins's at times irritating vocals make this album sound pressing in the negative meaning of the word. There are some excellent tracks, like ""Tv Party"", ""Rise Above"", ""Six Pack"" and ""Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie"" , but tracks like ""Depression"", ""Room 13"" and ""Damaged II"" just don't do it for me... If you are a hardcore fanatic or a Black Flag/Rollins fan, this is recommended, but those who haven't made their minds; give it a spin at the local recordshop before rushing to buy this one."
2,two stars for rise above ..zero for the rest,"Anybody who was around when this album was released knows this was the beginning of the end for Black Flag. I admit its far better then any of the boy bands pretending to be punks(blink, good charlotte etc.) out now. Somebody commented on how ""groundbreaking"" this album was because they couldnt find a distributor. Sorry but your confused too. This album was punk for the mainstream frat boys and others just like blink and green day are now. Pure crap if you want to hear raw punk buy the first four years."
4,the last good Black Flag record,"Henry Rollins is to Black Flag what Sammy Hagar is to Van Halen. He joined after all the truly classic material had already been written, but led the band to their period of greatest popularity. This is the first album Rollins recorded with Black Flag, and the only good one. On this album, Rollins mostly sings songs that were part of the Black Flag repertoire from the period before he joined. Later, when Rollins started to contribute to the songwriting, the quality of the material plummeted. But this album is great. Buy this album together with the ""First Four Years"" compilation, and you'll have all the Black Flag you need. ""First Four Years"" includes the great singles with Dez Cadena singing. Compare the Dez version of ""Six Pack"" with the much-weaker Rollins version on ""Damaged."""
5,o fasho,"wow, black flag is where its at! i will admit i dont listen to any punk or hardcore besides black flag. not the biggest fan. but i am a huge metal and classic rock fan. (doors, black sabbath,pantera) etc... i love albums that u can listen to from front to end and be like damn, lets play that again. im into the albums by black flag with rollins as vocals. this album through ""in my head""... while this is probably my least favorite flag album with rollins(roll your eyes) it is stil an unbelievable album for its time. the pure energy off this album is amazing. i think why i like black flag so much is greg ginns riffs and rollins vocal approach. i would highly recommend buying this beast of a record. also check out my war, slip it in, loose nut, in my head, and family man."
5,LOVE IT,Black Flag is amazing This is my favorite CD out of all of them. Rise Above and Police Story are my favorite songs. They are genius! You should also check out the Black Flag cover song HATEBREED did!
3,Pretty lame,"In 4th grade, we had to watch this movie. It totally sucked! The setting was totally crappy too. But, when I found it Tim Burton was involved with this movie, I liked it more!"
2,PHP Unexplained,"I've found most books in the Bible series to be quite good and in-depth. This is not the case with the PHP4 Bile, which barely scratches the surface on the subject of the greatest open-source server side scripting language (PHP). The book is very simplistic, yet at the same time not descriptive enough of the simple examples it gives. Two exapmples in ch 27 did not work without having to change the coding. The book offers very little above and beyong the online manual. The book would better be titled PHP4 Bible For Beginners. If you're looking for a good explanation of useful php functions with real-world examples, buy Professional PHP Programming from Wrox."
4,Excellent resource for both vets and newbies,"I had a database/dynamic webpage assignment for a course I was taking, and instead of following, in lemming style, the rest of the class in using ASP, I decided to give PHP a shot. Prior to this point I had looked at PHP for no more than a few minutes. This book was an excellent resource... It both teaches and acts as a reference at the same time. I would suggest this to anyone who is considering picking up a PHP book.Take note however, things may be a bit tough to get started on if you haven't had any experience programming in C/C++ as PHP syntax is very similar. My C++ programming experience was rather meager prior to learning PHP, but just being familiar with some of the syntax was a great help."
2,"Examples too complicated, some errors, but adequate overall","The first thing I noticed working through this book is that most of the examples are pointlessly complicated, and not even useful in the real world. There is no real layout to how functions are shown... you're given an example or two, and that's about it. Rarely do they give a detailed list of parameters, and how to properly use it. No appendix of functions for easy reference, either. The most disturbing problem is the glaring errors in the book. The biggest error is the assumption that register_globals is on, even though in recent versions of PHP it defaults to off. The code does not mention where this will matter, creating some very frustrating searches through the real PHP documentation on how to properly use a variable. I've noticed many other errors in the use of functions in the book. There is no errata on the website, either. This book is two years old, and shows it's age. Get a better PHP book... there's plenty of them."
1,Call it PHP 4 Beginners Guide,Very disappointed with this book. I have bought several other Bible series books and was very happy with them. I have had this book for a while now and everytime I run into a problem I grab the book and it gives me no help. The index is very poor ... you can't even look up a simple function like urlencode cause it isn't there! This is probably fine for a beginner but that is it cause once you get going with PHP there is no way you can use this book as a reference!!!
3,"Not the level of quality I'd expect from the ""Bible"" series","I am an admirer of the ""Bible"" series of books, especially the Javascript Bible by Danny Goodman. This book is not of the same caliber. It covers lots of materal, but not in the depth seen in other Bible series books. It also lacks the excellent organization that I see in other Bible series books. That this comes without a CD of example code or a searchable PDF of the text is another dissapointment."
3,"good book, but not for newbees","You will find widesread function list, but the online documentation will be the better choice. Otherwise in this book there are so many examples, but also to many mistakes. Conclusion: If you have experiences with PHP you it could be helpful to buy this book, otherwise you shouldn't!"
4,Good Book,"This is good for a person with some PHP progrmaming experience. The author covers all of the areas pretty thouroughly, but at some points it becomes boring. I admit though that it would be hard not to make it boring. Definatley buy this book if you are serious about PHP programming."
5,Another gem from one of the best!,"Glory Train is another stellar offering of gospel gems by Randy Travis. The variety, both musically and selection wise is superb. Randy uses that expressive and emotive barritone beautifully here. ""Were You There"" makes this listener,wish they had been. He gives it such importance and power. ""Up Above My Head"" and ""SWing Down Chariot"" with the vocal harmonies of the Blind Boy's Of Alabama make these such enjoyable listening. The entire album is a genuine touch of trials and triumps, sung by one of the greatest country stylist of all time. Don't miss out on the blessings this album has to offer. Great job once again, Randy."
5,Travis Going His Own Way,"I like RT because he is not afraid to explore his own musical directions, wherever the spirit may take him. The old time spiritual feel is complimented on this collection of recordings by a masterful interpretation on Travis' part. Congrats on a big success :) A song I wrote called ""Changes"" is modeled after the Travis graceful style."
4,Nice for my old RC. Not meant for the current RC Supreme design.,Works fairly well. A little hard to pick up primers into the tubes. Maybe it will loosen up over time? I am spoiled with the dillon tubes that are very easy to use with the dillon priming on the SD press. Still much much better than hndling the primers individually with your fingers?
2,Mailbox,"This is a cheap mailbox and it feels like it and works like it. I put it up but it would not stay in place.However, it was a mailbox and served its purpose"
5,Alone is Pearl Jam at its best,This single is one of pearl jams finest. I have to say the best song on the CD is Alone. Why this was never released is beyond me. If you are going to buy a single make sure you pick up this one.
1,Academic psycho-babble,"If you want nonsensical academic psycho drivel, get this book, but if you want to succeed with women, get the Louis and Copeland book instead."
1,Do not confuse with the other book of same title,"This book should not be confused with another book of the same title written by Ron Lewis and David Copeland which is the best and most practical book on the subject in print. This book is not only vague and impractical, it is full of broken syntax which makes it a headache to read. I assume that all or most of the praises this book has collected was posted by mistake. It is the other book that should get the praises."
1,No substance whatsoever,"I don't know how this book got so many five-star ratings. Did I read the same book? It has no substance whatsoever. It is all some spiritual babble-speak. Here is a typical paragraph:""When a woman is drawn to a man it is because she wants to experiance the male voice of the universe. She is aware of this. She is very much in touch with herself as the female voice and tends to assume that you have a parallel awareness of yourself. A man's inner experience is to feel the might and majesty of the universe. Women know that too and their highest wish for you is to draw your power through the veil of their outer form to their inner subjective world.""If that helps you with dating, then buy the book. Otherwise, you are much better off with another book with the exact same title."
1,what a bunch of slop!,"This book bites the big one. A bunch of psycobabble junk. Like a cheap John Gray knockoff. At least John Gray is interesting. For a real dating book, try The Passive Man's Guide to Seduction."
2,Not my kind of book,"I found the language very vague and the ideas difficult to follow. As a result, I gleaned only a rudimentary understanding of what the author was trying to say.Frankly, part of me suspects the author concocted a lot of pseudo-metaphysical jargon to disguise the shallowness of his message. I have no problem with ethereal concepts but I prefer straightforward language, and at least an attempt to describe the concepts as specifically as one might describe an orange or a goat. But it seems that this kind of language speaks to many people...so if youre that kind of person, this book might be just what you need.Like most guys, I'm interested enough in getting chix that I will read numerous books on the subject, just for the exposure. And in that respect I guess this book was worth buying and reading. Other than that I can't say whether this book is really any good. I can only say I won't be using it."
1,Do not buy this book: save you money,"Yea, like the other guys I bought this book along with some of the other dating guides and really got burned. I really hoped Anthony would deliver the goods, but this book really was Un-helpful. I have read other books and at least learned something new, but this book was really stupid. Have you ever noticed that people with Ph.D.'s can often be the biggest idiots? This guy with all his macho bravo probably couldn't get a woman if someone put a gun to his head. I really wish I could get my money back for this book. Save your money and buy some of the other books out there like Don Steele or Graff."
4,Worthwhile,"Read this book and I believe you will gain some insight and inspiration. This book is a short, easy read, but the information will help you examine your view of women and how to relate to them. It has some visualization exercizes in it that may seem like drivel to some, but visualization is a proven technique so why not take advantage of it. The book may help you resolve issues that bother you from past relationships and help you move on to better relationships. I have experienced the power of this information first-hand, and I don't use the word power lightly, because that is the feeling you have after reading it. Even if you are already in a relationship that is working it is worth reading. I bought this book to help me figure out what I had done wrong in my last relationship and it helped a lot. Another worhwhile book is Light Her Fire. Good Luck!"
1,This book Sucks!,"I made a mistake and purchased this book instead of a book by the same title by Ron Louis and David Copeland. The quality and the information is boring, useless, and written in an overly academic style. Anthony doesn't stand a chance in the dating literature when there are other books out that propose a ""street wise"" approach. Besides, the information was hard to apply and didn't seem to be tested by real men in real situation.I recommend that anyone skip this book and purchase something else."
1,Don't waste your time and money!,"This is a worst book about women that I have ever red. Instead buy ""How to Succeed With Women"" by Ron Louis, David Copeland."
5,Do what's in this book and don't act,This books keys into the differences between men and women that count. It shows you how to get real with women and how to use what they do to you to connect with them. The book is sincere and loaded with practical wisdom. You don't have to be an actor to use the exercises and make rapid progress. I learned more about how to enjoy women too.
5,A Great Resource,O Croinin's book is an accessible and exciting source of information on Gaelic culture - a must read for anyone interested.
3,Harvest Moon on a Desert Island,"If you like the daily chores and gradual increase in complexity of Harvest Moon, you will like this game. Compared to the first Lost in Blue: the story line is less compelling, and you do spend a lot of time at first just staying alive. After you discover the first few tools, it gets much easier. On the plus side, the mini-game to build furniture is much less frustrating than it was in the first game, so you can get the furniture and shelves more easily. I find this kind of game addictive, and I have enjoyed it very much."
4,Lost in Blue 2 is a great game!,"As a fan of games like the Sims, this one is great. I spend HOURS every day on it and still there is so much game left. I haven't been able to complete it in a few days or a week like many other games. Some of the mini games are frustrating (like making fire, building), but I highly recommend this game. I have purchased many DS games and this one is the highest on my list!"
2,Very Tedious and Depressing,"This game simply is boring and almost sad. I like the idea of the whole survival aspect but all you really end up doing is constantly looking for food (which the characters don't like), resting (really fun...), stopping for water, and trying to figure out why you bought this game. It can be sad in the respect that your characters always seem to be slowly dieing and all you can do is find random food items, cook and eat them ( doesn't help them much), and then going out to get more food items. It is very repetitive and even depressing to some people, especially younger children, my sister hated it! Overall a good idea but very repetitive and boring.Lost In Blue 2"
2,"Ok, if you like tedious boring stuff.",I got this game expecting an open ended style game. But there really is just one way to succeed. It was difficult at first to find the balance you need to survive but it wasn't fun enough to stick it out. The actual game play is clunky and the graphics are poor.
5,An Old Punk,"The title should be ""a great disc never found"". I had this album on tape back in the day and nostalgia creeps up on me everytime I hear it(and I become more annoying). I still can't figure out why people prefer trash to good ol' solid rockin bands. These guys made me think a little differently about what great music was back when the majority of what I listened to was The Exploited, 999, The Damned, and so on. This album rages, although to look at the cover you would never know it. The good Rev. Horton Heat should take a page from these songs and remember what blown out cowpunk rock & roll sounded like in the good ol' days of Ronnie Reagan . Take a chance. Buy the disc..."
5,An Absolute Must Have!,"Pictures, references to specific historical and some lesser known places, explicit detail on mannerisms and etiquette--this book is everything that you would want out of a travel guide. DK has always done a wonderful job with their books, but this one has truly outdone all others!"
2,Eyewitness Guide to Australia,"I purchased this book on the recommendation of our travel agent. It is very disappointing. There is no information about any wildlife parks, such as the Koala Park near Sydney and others. I found much more information on the Internet. The companion book (the map book) may be more helpful - the map part - but it is very large and difficult to refold. I expect books for tourists to have information about areas to tour - and in Australia I think that wildlife parks must be mentioned. It is possible that the Internet will take over for travel books if writers don't provide information that tourists need."
3,Great Pictures and Maps...but could be better.,"With its wealth of maps, I will certainly take along the book during my travels. As a person going to Australia for the first time, I feel that the book could provide a larger listing of lodging recommendations. If you want a book with lots of pretty pictures of the land, then this is the book for you. But if you need a book to help you plan your vacation, look elsewhere."
5,Fascinating!!!,"Really neat info on how insects keep warm/cool down and why they move in those ways - shivering, bouncing, etc. The text is really easy to read and interesting to get into - the drawings sprinkled in throughout help make understanding that much easier. I don't have a science background - just have an insatiable hunger to learn about our natural world and this book definitely filled one corner of that hunger......Ever see a dragonfly stand up like its doing a headstand? Well its not because it like the head rush (or maybe that too but the book doesn't talk to that) - the reason they do that is on p. 66 - ""When the sun is directly overhead some dragonflies assume the 'oblisk' position, which minimizes surface area exposed to solar heating while maximizing the area available for convective cooling."" ....all to say, it was a hot day and the dragonfly needed to cool down :) Excellent book!"
5,Litter Locker refill,This product is great for storing used cat litter for at least a week without odor.
5,Petmate LitterLocker Plus Refills,Love these! Price much better than anywhere else and shipping time was pretty good too. Would recommend ordering from them!
4,Petmate Litterlocker Plus Refill,"This item really does keep odors at bay. My only complaint is when it is full and ready to be cleaned, it is very heavy. I can deal with it though."
5,Great deal!,I used to buy this product at PetCountry or other pet stores. I found it at Amazon at a way better price and have been buying it here ever since.
1,Horrible Read,"If you like the most boring, theoretical read...go for it. Actually, I found this book a great non-addictive substitute for sleeping aids. I could only recommend it to someone with insomnia."
3,Supererstition perhaps!,"Since owning my first car I have bought deer horns of one make or another. I have never hit a deer, so maybe they work, but I take this belief with a grain of salt. Take this story for instance; the very day I installed these horns, about three hours afterin fact, my wife and I drove through a wooded area and wouldn't you believe it, a deer ran right in front of our vehicle. Maybe these horns caused the deer to start running before we got to it, we were driving about 45, but I don't really think these things work, but maybe. I will continue to put deer horns on my vehicles, but more out of superstitious duty than out of a belief that they really work. Also, as far as humor is concerned, when you recieve these deer horns the package has a picture of a car with a deer right in front of it. Go figure!"
1,No customer service,"I called Deer Alert (Custom Accessories, Inc) 2 weeks ago at 1-800-962-6676 and left a message on a woman who works for customer service's voicemail. I explained that one of the whistles didnt have a hole through the back, so it wouldnt work. I gave her my phone number and explained the problem. Still no call back. I went and bought from another company."
4,Would be good to know if they work,"I have had these deer whistles for a few months after a deer run across my truck and she got killed and my truck pretty damaged. Clearly, I have no evidence if they work or not. If one does not have a deer accident one may believe it is the whistles that work. If a deer runs across one's way one can believe it was a freak accident. Does the manufacturer have any evidence they work? Have they done any controlled experiments?I use them because I hope they will help, almost the same way as superstition works.One thing for sure is that the manufacturer was helpful in telling me how to relocate them in one of my cars. I called and they did return the call. That was refreshing."
1,Need another,"This item was sent to me with one of the, broken they said they would send another then never did"
3,Made a deer look,"I gave these to my girlfriend, who drives a deer-laden path to work every day. She's had them for a month without incident. She said that a deer on the side of the road ""looked at"" her while she passed one time... So it didn't drive the deer away, but didn't run into her car either (which has happened before). I'm still feelin good about the product."
3,working as expected in Grille of Volvo,"Needed expert help to place them in Volvo Grille but seem to be working with smaller animals, Crows, Vultures, raccoons and deer now seem to either freeze or get out of roadway when car approaches. My set was Black not chrome as pictured.One had no opening in back and made whistle noise when air was blown in through front. Other on had large whole in back of cone section and when air was blown in I didn't hear any noise. Not sure if this was 'defect or intentional'.But I placed both in grille about 16 inches away from each other facing outward. Did replace their supplied tape with 3M double sided tape that I had. Allowed them to set up/dry time of 24 hours before driving vehicle anywhere. Do not remove these when washing car that was reason to use 3M tape rather then their supplied double sided tape. Plus units placed on shelf behind grille for added protection."
3,forever war,This was slow at times but interesting concept. The main person was hard to get to know and not sure of his idea or desire in life. was ok
3,dated but good,Although we have a intergalatic war set in the 90's this book has it's good points. Haldeman creates an unlikely hero with depth and emotion that draws the reader into the story despite the somewhat slow begining. The time dialation and future shock that our main character suffers upon his return to earth gives a since of lonliness and displacement that can be felt. The ending was surprising and well recieved by this reader. I would have given this book higher marks but I felt it needed more action and some attention to giving the enemy aliens more depth.Still a good read though.
2,A little overhyped...,"After reading the glowing reviews I was really looking forward to reading this book. In a nutshell, too much telling and not enough showing with little to no character development. Finishing this book was a challenge as I did not care about the characters or ""The Forever War"". If you want a great war book by another vietnam vet check out Matterhorn."
3,Don't know what all the hype is about,"I read The Forever War because it was listed on Amazon as one of the best books of 2009. Truly I don't know why. I like science fiction and this was just so-so. The ending made all the reading at least worth it but I would not recommend it. Its difficult to follow, does little to develop the plot and the characters come and go to quickly for you to care about them. There is a graphic sexual scene that degrades women. It has little to do with the story and lets hope that is not what future military careers hold for women."
3,Nobody wants to read a Science Fiction Novel about Viet Nam,"The above is an excerpt from the author's note at the beginning of this book, which was woefully missing from any of the Amazon reviews or customer reviews of this book.Haldeman writes a good war novel, if a bit antiquated (the original copyright *is* 1972). However, this is not a science fiction novel, and I found myself a bit disappointed by it. I've given it a three-star rating because it *was* enjoyable, but not as much as some of the other SF (Hamilton, Asimov, Cherryh, etc) I've read recently."
2,Not bad but nothing new,"After Old Man's war and so many other ""battle"" stories, this one just didn't offer anything new or different. I wasn't overall impressed."
2,I dont get the hype.,There were some really great original ideas in these pages. the main character and story just didnt do it for me.
3,Not my Genre,"So it's not that I didn't like this book, but my friend recommended it to me and told me it was a great read.Granted, it was a good read, but I got lost about 10 chapters into the book. Now this may just be my style of reading, but it was confusing, so maybe my mind isn't that imaginative. I wish I could have finished it :/"
4,Good read,This was required reading for a class and I found myself really enjoying it. The time travel aspect was fascinating and the parallels to the author's Viet Nam experience were easily seen.
3,Not a good end to an otherwise good book,"I was really into the book all the way until the end. I would go on a rant about how the end was so terrible but it would be full of spoilers. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because I really liked the main characters but, again, the ending ruined it for me.As a side note, I know this book is older than a lot of the other sci-fi/military books that I've read and so a lot of those books borrowed ideas/concepts from this author (and others). However, I feel like some of the newer books handle the technology aspect a little better. I know they have the benefit of actually seeing some of these advancements being within grasp of reality and most of the older writers were just making it up as they went along. But I feel this might of contributed to the slight disconnect that was always prevalent."
5,Loved it!,"I'm a huge fan of Heinlein & this book blew Starship Troopers away.As you'll see from my reviews of other authors/books; I can be a bit tough on poor grammar, prose, etc.No complaints on the basic mechanics of this guys writing & to top it off; the story was extremely entertaining..."
5,Exceptional,"The minute I read this book, I couldn't stop recommending it to everyone. I love science fiction -- even though much of it is driven by ideas (about technology or first contact) instead of characters. This is the rare book that combines a brilliantly simple idea (the time dilation effects of interstellar warfare) and a strong character. Must read."
3,Good read for sci fi fans.,"The only part of the book I didn't care for was all the time jumping. Made it hard to follow in some places. But overall was a good read. Some parts were a little slow, hard to stay focused. But I do recommend."
3,Forever War,Long time since I've read science fiction. I was fascinated by the imaginative detail about survival in deep space. Loved the coping skills learned by the soldiers. Saddened by the conditions left on Earth.
3,Ok but slow to get going.,"It took almost a third of the book before I got hooked to keep reading. The author is predisposed with hetro sex and drugs. I only wished he had given more info on how society had devolved since the first deployment. Would I read it again, no. Not bad for the price."
5,This is one of the BEST sci-fi ever,"This book is just simply FANTASTIC. It it perfect for bed-side or bathroom reading. The chapters are short and the sections in them are only a few pages long. Just pick it up and read for 5-10 minutes when you can. Haldeman gets right to the point of things. There is no flowery speech that goes on for pages to just describe a guy walking down a hallway. It quick paced and cunning. GREAT work. You may also like: Armor, Ender's Game, Bodyguard, Legacy of Herot, if you liked this one."
4,It was worth reading,"I decided to try and read this since it is considered to be one of the best sci-fi books of all time. It started a little slow and I wasn't sure where it was going but as I ended up becoming more engrossed in the lead character's story by about the half-way point I couldn't put it down.This is NOT an action packed adventure story, it's a story about man who cannot get out of the military. I would consider it more of a drama. You can definitely read the parallels to the Vietnam war and I could understand why it may have been controversial back when it first came out.Overall this was a good read and would recommend it to anyone interested in the sci-fi or anti-war genres."
4,Interesting futuristic look ahead,"Saw a quote from this book in the Experience Music museum in Seattle WA. It prompted me to order it and both my husband and I read and enjoyed the book. The technical descriptions in the early part were only somewhat understandable, but the look at the future was compelling. Especially for a book written long ago."
4,A Sci-Fi Classic,"This book frequently gets mentioned in the same breath as Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers,"" and, in that light, it usually (and properly) gets second billing. Still, this is a solid and enjoyable piece of military sci-fi, and its tongue in cheek tone keeps it moving along even when the story line is a little flat. The characters are very well developed, and, if you don't start caring for them by the middle of the novel, you're probably clinically dead. Definitely worth the read"
5,Real Sci-fi,I read it a long time ago and it is as good today as then. I highly recommend. The real deal.
1,The Foever War,"I was very disappointed. The book won Hugo and Nebula awards, butI can't figure out why. I do not recommend this book. Very postVietnam: anti-war, counter culture and sexual revolution trash."
3,Is it homophobic?,"I to was introduced to Haldeman through SF magazines & anthologies. Yet it seemed like this book said if we accepted homosexuals they'd take over. Even if you believe homosexuality is a sin, they still have a right to live as they choose. Just like people have a right to be Buddhist or Muslim or whatever. I hope I missed its point."
3,The Forever War,"I ordered this book because my niece was reading it for he literature class in school. Unfortuneately, I have not read it yet."
5,A new classic,"Bought this as a gift for my husband, an avid scifi reader who prefers much older books to the modern. Here's what he had to say: ""Ranks with the classics of science fiction literature; thought-provoking, well-written, difficult to put down. Deserves all the awards that it won."""
5,Good Science Fiction,"I had wanted to read this book for a while but just didn't get around to doing it, I am not disappointed in it. Awesome storyline, unlike anything else I have read. Haldeman creates insights on the sociology of the future and addresses concerns such as economics, sexual orientation, and overpopulation. It's one of those books that makes you think if the future portrayed could possibly be our own. Another fav of mine to add to my science fiction collection."
4,"Old Feel, But Interesting","The Forever War is indeed a ""classic"" bit of Scifi, which is a good way way of saying that its good fiction, but you can also feel some of its age in the way things are described. On the whole I enjoyed the book, it really did make me wonder though what we will do with ourselves if we ever manage to create a workable system of interstellar travel that still has to deal with relativity. I'm not sure we'll be able to handle it as a unified culture. And if we can't stick together, well, lets hope we cast the seeds far and wides so they can't ALL get themselves into trouble."
4,Interesting sci-fi story but the hightlight is the theme of evolving society.,"I enjoyed this book without loving it. The sci-fi storyline was interesting enough however the highlight was the commentary of an evolving human society.It is certainly worth a read if you enjoy visions of the future.I didn't realise until i had finished when the book was written, it has stood the test of time well and some of the themes are more relevant now than ever."
4,Excellent,Enjoyed this very interesting look at the realities of interstellar travel and the futility of war. Shades of US invasion of Iraq in the themes of this book.
2,"Slick writing, correct politics and an unsatisfying story","Some reviewers ask how this snoozer won awards. No mystery here. Slick writing, hip 70's views about sex, politics and war equals Hugo and Nebula awards---simple as that. I disagree with reviewers who say the battle scenes are exciting. They are written purposely NOT to be exciting, NOT to be satisfying, NOT to be involving. This is an antiwar novel, not an enthralling story. If you read novels for symbolism, political analysis and hard science, then this is your meat. If, on the other hand, you need a story with characters you care about as well, then trySisters of Glass, SF by an author who's first priority is telling a story."
2,Insightful but Homophobic,"Upon finishing Joe Haldeman's ""The Forever War"", the author's text stayed with me for quite a while, but perhaps not in the way he had intended. While I was impressed by the story's insights into the pointlessness of war, what stayed with me the most was it pervasive homophobia. Rather than coming away from the book thinking about the nature of humanity and admiration for Mr. Haldeman for writing such a wise and compelling story, I simply came away feeling sad. Sad for Mr. Haldeman for detracting this reader from the wisdom of his insights into the Vietnam war by his inability to see beyond his own prejudice and sad that friends and reviews would recommend such a homophobic book. With all of its insights, the book's greatest irony is how it could so movingly point out one form of human stupidity while pervasively supporting another."
2,Dated and Demented,"The first several chapters read like a high school short story writing project. Filled with adolescent fantasies of orgies, drug use, and no character development. After the first ""section"" the story does start to mesh some. The main problem is the logic presented for human changes over the centuries just doesn't seem realistic. In the end I felt very much like I had read a 60s pulp sci-fi story. No character development, very dry, and I'm sorry to say very boring. When it won a Hugo it must have been a very bad year if no competition could beat it. Read Vernor Vinge instead."
5,A fine taste for the absurd,"This is one of science fiction's finest, best books. It took a Vietnam vet with a degree in the sciences to get it on paper, but Joe Haldeman takes you down twin tracks in Forever War. The main character slogs through a set of adventures that rank as great writing mixing Hemingway in equal parts with Oscar Wilde. AND there is that little extra added complication of those campaigns taking place at the end of a relativistic 'crack-the-whip' that brings him back to a society that is less and less his own.Buy this book, like I do, every couple of years. Re-read it and then give it to someone you know who likes to use their brain. You'll enjoy it all over again, and you'll end up with a large circle of friends."
2,Dated and pretty disappointing,"This book was very highly praised and I very much looked forward to reading it. I liked its anti-war message and theme. It was a good analogy for how alien and lost veterans of war must feel when they return home.But I have to say overall I was very disappointed. It seemed very dated. Its depictions of sex were juvenile and overdone and didn't really add anything to the story. I found there was nothing in the story that gripped me and kept me turning pages, wanting to find out where it was going, and what was going to happen next.If you like a good strong plot, then look elsewhere."
5,An impressive classic - a must read for all sci-fi fans,"A work of incredible imagination that takes your breath away. Peppered with acerbic humor, e.g. weapons so advanced that it renders all but hand-to-hand combat effective. It will haunt your imagination for a long time. Highly recommended."
5,Sci-Fi At Its Best,"This book is simply sci-fi at its best. The world that Haldeman creates is simultaneously complex and beyond human comprehension, but yet completely understandable."
3,Interesting concept,"The concept is novel. The Characters are okay. A good book, worth reading. Not my favorite, but then there's no accounting for taste..."
3,"Interesting in some areas, but lacking in others","I have mixed feeling about this book. While I enjoyed the discussions of battle and the concept of reletivistic time, I felt that the book really suffered when trying to predict the future. I understand that this story is a Vietnam allegory, but I just didn't find it that interesting."
4,An awesome adventure and scifi Nam experience,"This book is cool. Get a look into how much a country and a person can change during war. The earth Mandala returns to after each combat tour mirrors what it must have been like to return to the U.S. from Nam after so much social change in the 60s. The bureaucratic shenanigans do not change in the future, and in the end, nobody thanks the soldier for defending them from nothing. The joke's on you. I was somewhat disappointed in the ending, but on the other hand, I was impressed with the ending before the ending. A fun, recommended read."
2,Couldn't Get Through It,"I'm not sure if I was missing something with this book, which seems to have a good number of fans, but I just couldn't get through it. Got to 40% on my Kindle and just gave up. The characters are just so remarkably flat and interchangeable that I didn't give a crap what happened to them, and for the most part, couldn't even tell them apart."
3,Blah!,"This is an average book. There are interesting ideas in this book. While there are moments that show me the author served in the military, it falls well short of feeling real. The characters sound like they work in an office more than elite soldiers. Some parts I enjoy, but most of the ""combat"" sequences (or serious training concepts) are painful.I wouldn't recommend this as anything other than a standard military sci-fi. The author's experiences don't come across."
2,"Unfortunately, I Was Expecting So Much More...","based on the reviews I read. But I was highly disappointed.Mr. Haldeman started with a great concept and theory. Unfortunately, the novelty of the concept just couldn't overcome the weakness of the storyline. It had no staying power and I became disinterested in what would happen to the main character. By the end, the story was just dragging on and I couldn't wait for it to finish.And the finish itself was so lame. Talk about anti-climactic. Usually the reveiws here(Amazon) are pretty reliable, but I guess this book was just one of those rare occasions where I'm off-kilter with everyone else."
4,Great introduction into Haldeman's work,"I am very impressed with this novel. I had questions about wear the story was going in the beginning and even through the middle. But as the it comes to a close, the entire story makes more sense than expected. I look forward to reading his other novels."
5,Well-written classic that stands the test of time,"Sci-Fi stands out as a genre that doesn't lend itself to getting better with age, making The Forever War impressively exceptional."
4,"Dated, but very good","What do I like about this book?The writing is crisp, clear, no-nonsense. Stuff happens: no dawdling, no obsessive detail or woolgathering. Haldeman's dry sense of humor isn't apparent until near the end of the book, which is unfortunate, but he's always good for a few interesting observations.I also like the fact that the book is some 250 pages long. THANK GOODNESS! I am getting so sick of wading through 500 page door stoppers. Brevity seems to be a lost art these days.What don't I like about this book?Well, Haldeman's crystal ball definitely needs polishing. His version of 1996 (and 2017 for that matter) is quite...interesting. He seems a little obsessed with homosexuality, too; just a wee tinge of homophobia there. But oh well.Overall, nicely done. Fun, fast read. And heck, great work for 1974."
2,"Interesting, but anachronistic","I never read this book until recently. I can see why it is a classic in sci-fi, and I greatly enjoyed the detail it gets to with the physics, especially the time dilation that is the centerpiece of the book.The Vietnam allegory is very transparent to the point of seeming amateurish.The author's obsession with sexual orientation alternates between amusingly juvenile and disturbing.Also, while it is only mentioned occasionally, women being required to have sex with men on demand, by law (early in the book, assumedly not went Earth switched to a ""homo life"" norm; his word, not mine) is simply creepy.Also, the omnipresence of legalized drugs dates this book badly as well.While an interesting story worth reading, it has aged badly. The anachronistic viewpoints and society of the 70's are distracting at the least. Also, almost all of the technology is out of place, being too primitive at the start and painfully so at the end, given that a thousand years have passed."
5,Epic,"Very brief read. Knowing that Haldeman saw Vietnam first hand makes the whole book much more vivid; although nothing in the book directly references Nam, the discussion of cultural isolation experienced by soldiers adds a very human touch to this classic."
5,Review of Haldeman's 'Forever War',"Haldeman presents a compelling and thorough alternate world. His work, while entertaining, presents a clear analysis of the relationship between time, war and personality. I was especially interested in his analysis of shifting social culture in an overpopulated planet. The writing itself is straightforward, free of florid description, and yet his detailed plot offers itself to many important problems facing the future of humanity, and to any individual living in a time of war."
3,Sad story,"Read due to a recommendation. Interesting premise and written out of Vietnam experience. Good anti-war story, but you have to like distopia's to really appreciate it."
5,Great,This book is great. I think I found my new favorite science fiction writer the only problem is the ending is a little weak.
3,Question for readers,"Is it commonplace for the author approved edition from AVON (1997) to have so few pages, 202 to be exact?"
4,Time-space continuum at its best,I have only recently started reading sci-fi novels and came accross The Forever War a bit by accident.From the first page the narrative had me hooked; the main character starting-out as being 'just normal' and ending-up as being extra-ordinary. The action flows incessantly and never ceases to get dull.I especially liked the way society (and the codes of conduct and acceptable behaviour) back on earth changes throughout the story. A highly recommendable read.
3,a little boring,The story goes on and on -- a forever story -- but it never really takes off with anything truly powerful. It's just another run-of-the-mill war story set in the future.
5,Haldeman is a very good writer,I recently reread Forver War and it was as good as the first time. Also recommend some other SF military type stories such as Doherty's AREA 51 books and Dickson's Dorsai books.
5,Very good book!,"I really liked this book. First of all, ""The Forever War"" makes a greatly entertaining read (if only for the hell of reading). Though militarization and blind obedience (no matter how good the cause) causes my gut to wretch with pangs of utter puke, this book is a good and ""frank"" account of the possible psychological, moral, and socio-economic aspects of war. I learned a lot from this book and I recommend it highly and without reservations."
4,"read it in a day, wish it was longer","This is an interesting book, but it doesn't seem to climax anywhere. Interesting ideas, if not a bit ecentric."
1,"Silly, boring, waste of time!","Don't bother with this book. I forced myself to read halfway through this book before resigning to the fact that this book is just plain 'silliness' wrapped up in sci-fi technobabble and hippy-love politics.The main characters are 'elite' conscripts (what conscripts have ever been elite?) simply because their IQ rates >150. They smoke weed whenever they like in service, the female conscripts are legally obliged to have sex with male conscripts as part of the 'perks' of the service and have assigned random sex every night (which they rush to with open legs, of course, in sci-fi land...)The story is very slow to develop and even by halfway through the book hasn't even really started.This book would probably appeal to teenage boys with military-sexual-alien fantasies.For a mature good sci-fi military book try Lee Stephen's Dawn of Destiny.Note that 'The Forever War' has 11 ratings of 1 at the time of my writing this review, and Dawn of Destiny has all 5-star ratings."
1,Strictly for Teens. . .,"I've enjoyed several sci-fi books through Amazon and generally find the reviews helpful. For this one, I can see why teen males would find it ""deep"" and give it high marks. There's plenty of sniggering sex-and-drugs-in-space, all told by a jaded and self-obsessed main character. For grown-ups in the 90's, however, this book is awfully stale."
1,disappointed,This is not a book to be cast aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force. Supremely disappointed. I read this just after reading Starship Troopers. Forever War is nowhere near as good.
2,Not too good.,"I will be concise.This book is highly overrated. This ""science fiction masterpiece"" doesn't come close to the engaging prose obtained in his short stories.For starters, this world is poorly detailed, hardly any historical info of his ""future world"" was given and I'm sure Mr. Haldeman could somehow have integrated some of that info. into the story.Secondly, where's the detail?Oh, of course detail is given, but at sparse intervals, and even then it doesn't present any real feeling of atmosphere.Lastly, where's the emotional depth?All this book is is one superficial view of human emotion; its just a poor atempt at a futuristic action story. If you like overrated,propaganda backed,literary drivel then this book is for you."
3,"Imaginative, But Not Enough Battles","I thought this book was pretty good; it was imaginative, had theme, seemed realistic and was well-written. However, since its title is The Forever War, I felt disappointed that the only real battles to which the reader is privy take place near the beginning and at the end of the book. That's right -- plenty of prepping, training, new weaponry and base-building, etc., but just two battles. Hence my rating. I can hardly believe it won Hugo and Nebula awards; must've been an off year...."
2,Overly Hyped,"I heard a lot of great things about this novel and was somewhat disappointed when I read it.The main character is one dimensional stereotype (stoic army hero, with a degree in physics, of course) and the author spends a little too much time trying to explain his theoretical world (the main thrust being that every time he travels in space to go to battle, he returns to the distant future).As in a lot of bad science fiction, there is a little too much emphasis on the sex life of the hero and not enough on story and character. I was still hoping that there might be some final redeeming twist in the end-(like maybe the aliens he had been battling were really just distant future versions of earthlings) but alas there was no such reward in the end. Just a cheesy ending.I think the author had a lot of cool ideas but they just didn't gel around a good character/story. Unfortunately this is very common in Science Fiction."
2,Definitely not for me,I have nothing positive to say about this book. I really tried to complete it but I couldn't even finish it.
3,The best work of an overrated writer,"Sure, there are notable, surprising themes of homosexuality present, but all in all, the novel starts out promising with its ideas and rather shockingly with its military edge, which begins to dull as the story goes along. No need to simply write a sci-fi Vietnam with the outmoded issues of that times prevaling. The test of good sci-fi is timeless. And this novel fails that test. But it's an okay read."
3,Only So-So,"I had mixed feelings about The Forever War. As military sci-fi, it fell somewhat flat for me, the action lacking intensity and punch, the technical details being vague, and the nuts and bolts of warfare and space flight in his universe being less than the sum of their parts. The speculation about the future, aside from being dated, also struck me as a bit too outlandish - but then again, one is given the impression that the book was never meant to be taken all that seriously. So on those counts, I was disappointed. However, it is an easy read, and the central gimmick - the effects of time dilation - was enough fun to get me through it in just a couple of days. If you do read it, enjoy it as broad comedy."
2,Boring and dated,"I read a lot of sci fi and can't understand the enthusiasm for this novel. Even though the main character is a reluctant soldier the description of military hardware and tactics seems to take up more than half the book. And then their's the author's obsession with homosexuality. It's so obvious that he was reacting to the changes going on in the late seventies, and was less than sympathetic. So he made it a big theme, which was in the end mostly a distraction. The end finally addresses a question about the enemy introduced as soon as the fighting starts, but in a way that was almost predictable.There are a lot of great sci fi novels from decades past that don't feel dated. In my opinion, this is not one of them (though this is obviously a minority opinion)."
4,VERY OLD RERELEASE,I enjoyed this book back in high school in the early 1970's. save money by buying this book at a used book store.75 cents to a dollar and a half tops. good read
4,"Now, war is personal.","Originally published in 1974 by St. Martin's Press, the cover says this Eos Paperback (2003) is ""The Author's Preferred Edition of the Groundbreaking SF Classic."" In the Author's Note, Haldeman points out that he wrote ""The Forever War"" about his experiences in Vietnam. But the story examines war on a much bigger scale, along with how the very real effects of the physical laws of time and space - as well as societal change - can impact both us and the ones we love. ""The Forever War"" displays more compassion and less irrational flag-waving than Robert A. Heinlein's ""Starship Troopers"" (1959)."
4,Nice Space Opera,"No fantasy world here. Just a nice space opera. This could be another ""young readers"" take on ""Starship Troopers"" or even ""Stargate SG-1"". It's a great little escape that doesn't require a great deal of thought or analysis. Just choose a rainy Sunday afternoon and let the time pass."
1,"More jew, commie, spaceship prison porn","Jew authors claiming this book is chicken salad when it's really chicken s***. I couldn't finish it thru the race-mixing, slave/master, military cult-worship tripe. No plot, just a good title doesn't make for good reading. Stick to Bradbury or Clarke."
3,Good SciFi read,"Good read, but the author seemed to be a little bit preoccupied by what sexual relationships would be like in the future."
2,Unless it's going to have a very surprising ending,"It's not a bad book but I am reading it since I started it. I don't want to hurt the authors feeling,sorry... I find it hard to keep tabs on the characters, the story itself or what you may call the ""big picture"".Spoiler alert:The time travel is a nice touch but it somehow goes wrong instead of making the story more interesting."
3,I haven't actually finished it yet but...,"So I sort of purchased this book on a whim as a way to familiarize myself with my kindle and the buying process and what not and the little preview blurb was interesting enough. I think I'm about 8 or 9 chapters in and I've enjoyed it so far, I can't really say anything about the plot or people yet as I've honestly only just gotten the basics. I'll probably come back to edit this with more thoughtful input when I finish."
2,Couldn't get into it,"Although I am a sci-fi junkie, I did not care for this book. I gave it an honest try but did not finish it as it was too out there for my personal taste. I suggest sampling the book before purchasing."
5,Gritty sublight war than holds your attention.,"One of the most unusual books I have ever read about a war across interstellar distances, because it is fought with sublight vessels. Soldiers go off to fight, not coming back for twenty, fifty or a hundred years. Upon their return they find nothing recognizable, and the military becomes their home. Missions are sent across fifty years of travel time to fight at system that are no longer important, or at people the Earth is no longer at was with. Haldeman wrote a masterpiece with this one, which may be beyond those who are fanatical about Star Trek or Star Wars (both of which I love, but not to the point of thinking they are the best examples of scifi out there). I recommend this read to stir the imagination and see space war at it is most likely to be, based on the restrictions of relativity."
4,Why Did I Wait So Long,"I don't know why it took me so long to read this, but I am glad I finally got around to it. One of the best military sci-fi novels I have read."
3,100 Words or Less,"My main problem was the forever war really didn't have that much ""war"" in it. A large portion of the novel seemed the preparation for war, waiting for war, thinking about war, and the time between the war. I supposed that's to be expected, but unfortunately I found those sections somewhat boring.I suppose my main complaint is that nothing seemed truly detailed and in-depth. With the characters bouncing around between being soldiers or trying to not be soldiers, nothing felt cohesive. That's too bad. The writing was good. The idea was interesting. But this simply didn't deliver for me."
4,more science than adventure,"i don't like to write spoilers in my reviews so i'll try to speak in generalities.the main character was very well written and his story interesting. his descriptions of alien worlds i feel was lacking but the description of the science behind space travel and the methods they used to endure them was very interesting. the sex partner aspect i felt was odd as women are not like men and to assume that woman have the same sexual urges as a man is a little ridiculous; science has proved quite the contrary. but it served its purpose and it didn't distract me. i fancy a happy ending, i don't have to have it but i will always want it so i'm glad the story had one.good read, you should read it!"
3,Enjoyable but overrated?,"I know it's supposed to be kind of a classic but I wasn't particularly bowled over. I found it engaging and occassionally exciting but never really engrossing. Mediocre character development is somewhat offset by the mind-blowing idea of fighting a war under the circumstances of ""time dilation"" caused by traveling vast distances at near light speed. It picked up another star because of its exciting and satisfying ending."
3,Average,"Sometimes effective social commentary written in the shadow of the Vietnam War plays less well as time goes on. Action scenes virtually nonexistant. Interesting concept of ""forever"" war.Don't look for heroism, or even rancor, which may leave some readers unaffected. Why draft ""elite"" anyway?"
4,Great Science Fiction,"If you like Science Fiction with a an emphasis on the 'Science' then this is a book for you. The speculative nature of the book makes it very interesting, and it is amazing that it was written 25+ years ago."
3,Good... but is it a classic?,"Haldeman's ""Forever War"" is one of the most respected alien war books ever written. However, I think much of that comes from its Vietnam parallels. Now that the millennium has dawned, it's hard to see his aliens as Viet Cong or the military brass as US politicians. What's left is a good story that falls a bit short of its own reputation.This edition does restore the middle of the book detailing the protagonist's stay on Earth after his first tour of duty. It's good to have it back, but it doesn't even compare with books that have tackled this subject better such as Stanislaw Lem's ""Return from the Stars.""In summary, if you must read a book about alien warfare, read ""Enders Game"" or - the one that started it all - ""War of the Worlds"" before ""Forever War."" Haldeman's classic is good just not classic."
4,War is He--.,"At first, I was turned off by all the sexual references, but as I continued (someone told me it was a classic) I soon saw the relevance. Especially at the end. I was surprised how well it fit into the storyline. Good read."
5,Aspects of the future you never thought of,Love relativistic physics and this book looks at an element of it I had never thought of. Amazing book that gets you to really think about how the effects of light speed travel could affect war.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Having known about The Forever war for many years, I read it and did not quite see what all the accolades is about. I think that the idea and concept is great, but I find that it have not been made into the story it could have been, there are parts to the story which are very well written, but I do not think the story as a whole really is tied in to a believable full story, and I find the ending rather trite and not really how the story should have ended.There is a great setting for a grand and epic set of novels, squeezing it into one small volume may be why Haldeman had such trouble in getting it of the ground.It is an okay read, but it is far far far away from what I had expected."
4,War Novels,"Okay, so I was at the bookstore (will not mention which one, but really there is only one that sells new books in Lakeland Florida), and a customer approached me. He told of John Ringo and how cool his writing was. I promised to check into his war stories. I then recommended the Forver War by Joe Holdeman. The book is a fantastic journey with a veteran through the future of war. I think it will rock your world and would recommend you trying it out as well."
4,Library Book,"The book was in good shape, but it was a Library Book. It still had the card in the back for checking it out. It just made me wonder how or why the library was selling books, of which my copy was sold again.The story was as advertised... quite interesting."
4,I liked the story,"It was an interesting read. The author spins a good tale.I liked the plot and the characters.The editing was generally okay in this edition, with just a couple of jarring exceptions."
5,Easily one of the best SF books ever written,"I can understand why the book has remained popular for so long. The Hugo and Nebula awards were well deserved. I highly recommend this book, and will reread it often."
2,Pretty good sci-fi -- but no classic,"It is scary to read the glowing reviews of this book. True, the book clearly parallels the Vietnam War. But that is precisely what only the worst kind of science fiction would attempt to do. I don't want to be reminded of a certain time and place when reading a sci-fi novel, the setting should be universal and the possibilities endless. Dating the novel even more are the insipid references to ""required by law"" conjugal relations between the soldiers. This is more of a teenage male's fantasy than an honest, thought-out depiction of a possible future. But, all that being said, the writing was good and the plot interesting. I recommend it as an pretty good period piece, but any intelligent reading of The Forever War marks it as clearly dated. The book was written in the 70's and reads like it on almost every page."
4,"Short, effective, and almost powerfull.","This is a well written war book, that is very much in line with most of the 70's science fiction that I have read. It is full of odd sex themes, and non idealized violence. The book focuses around a drafted soldier named Mandella. He fights both the enemy and time over three campains. Each time he goes on a campain he loses more and more time relative to where he grew up. Each time he comes home, the world has moved on agian.This book is really about the displacement that soldiers feel when they come home to a place that has changed and moved on since they left. And the war itself is a not well hidden metafor for the Vietnam war. The problem that I had with this book is that I am not nearly old enough to remeber Veitnam, or it's imediate side effects. This book does not quite have the power to be a real classic. It is a very good short action novel, it just doesn't ever quite involve the reader enough to be considered one of the great sci-fi novels."
2,Equally understanding of human nature and military science,"Wow, where do start with this one. It starts off interestingly enough - the cream of the crop - the best and brightest - recruited to be an elite military unit to go off into space and ... become cannon fodder. Its as if a Marines recruiting poster took itself seriously. In a world of tactical nukes and lasers, platoons keep a tactical spacing between each other of ... 20 meters... I apologize for the sarcasm but its hard to avoid. There's nothing in this book approacing believability when it comes to humans interacting or anything to do with the military. Even the science disappointing. There's absolutely no depth, as if the author is an avid viewer of the science channel, and thought it would be fun to write something about the last episode he watched.There are so many interesting concepts in this book, any of which in the hands of a skilled author would have made an excellent read. Too bad... Really too bad."
1,Lousy,"Honestly, I have to buck the trend here against all the critics and people who loved it. Compared with a work like Ender's Game or even less, I beliewve this book is a one. Simply monotenous."
3,As Good As Genre Fiction Gets,Enjoyed this book immensely in the 1970s. Not quite so much the second time in 2011. Readers who rhapsodize about this book and others like it Dune and Enders Game come to mind are advised that it might be time for them to broaden their reading when they finish highschool. You are probably ready.
2,Underwhelmed,Interesting idea and shame that the content was so hollow. Really quite a dull plodding read with no real plot or depth to the story.
3,Good not great,"I read this after the Old Mans War trilogy... Good, not as engaging... Not bad either. More ""war is bad"" preachy and less just interesting story."
2,Why the hard language?,I was very disappointed with the author's use of the f-bomb so frequently that it ruined an otherwise very compelling story for me.
4,Gorgonzola Torte,"Torte is very creamy with alot of cranberries and nuts at the bottom. Excellent flavor, but use a simple cracker or melba type toast, so as not to take away from the flavor of the Gorgonzola. If you freeze the torte first, it will come out of the plastic container, for a nice presentation on your table."
5,I always wished I knew Kobie in real life...,"In the fourth book of the series, 14-year-old Kobie finds herself facing freshman year without her best friend. The year before, Gretchen had been in a serious car accident, which caused her to fall behind in her schoolwork and require repeating eighth grade. Naturally, she's horrified at the prospect, but determined to try making the best of her new school.But just about everything that could go wrong, does. Like some sort of weird Murphy's Law, Kobie attracts the wrath of Jeanette, a tough older girl, and Sandy, a kindhearted follower...both of whom, in their own ways, keep getting Kobie into trouble.When Jeanette threatens to kill Kobie, she decides to take matters into her own hands...This book is laugh-out-loud funny, one of Ransom's finest."
3,Fifteen and Holding,I loved this book. I was very sad when I found out that it was out of print. This book is about a girl who has to go to a diffrent high school than her best friend. At her new school she gets into all kinds of adventures like wanting to be in the popular group and wanting to get away from her follower Sandy. Then Jenatte starts to give her a hard time. This is a great book for all ages.
1,"Oh, no!",This video is nowhere near as appealing visually as the CD was musically. I am so disappointed in this product
4,Bob Marley wails again.,"This comes with a documentary as well as the 13 video selections that span Bob's career with the wailers. It's too bad the DVD doesn't include all the cuts (16 tracks) that the CD of the same name does (""Legend - Bob Marley""). I would have especially like to have seen a video of ""Waiting in Vain"" which was covered by Annie Lennox (formally of the Eurythmics) on her ""Medusa"" CD (I highly recomend ""Medusa"" if your a fan of Annie Lennox, or the Eurythmics). This is a good addition to your DVD collection for Bob Marley fans. There are three other (or more?) DVDs of Bob Marley and the Wailers on Amazon. If you enjoy documentaries sprinkled with video exerpts from from Bob's career there is also ""Bob Marley"" recently released on DVD. I have personally purchased four DVDs of Bob Marley from Amazon. I guess it doesn't get much better if you enjoy reggae music."
5,Great Video,I purchased this for my daughter. She loves Bob Marley and everything related to the man. She said the video was great. She really enjoyed seeing live footage of him.Per my teenage daughter...this is a must buy.
3,Decent,"The music selections on here are fine. I was disappointed with the ""Stir It Up"" video edit - the producers should have thrown more bread at the Old Grey Whistle Test blokes to get the entire performance. The documentary is filler - not very good. I recommend this, but there is better Bob stuff out there."
2,Shake,"I think interesting best describes this children's workout video and I am not sure that I intend this to be much more than mildly complimentary. Even I watch enough children's television to know that Kari Anderson is not exactly in touch with children. My three year old even commented that the tape was ""cheesy"". Unfortunately, I think that the instructor just has a poor, if sincere, understanding of children and the effect is a lacking rapport.Not a complete zero as the children have moved around a bit and it served the purpose we were after which was to encourage exercise. All-in-all, I rate this tape as highly as the average gym membership--money spent on unused services."
5,An inspiring set of legal history,"The primary holdings of some justices are emphasized: Marshall, Jackson, Frankfurther, Black, O'Connor and Rehnquist, and some others. The history and social backgroundm, and the interplay among Congress, President and Supreme Court help viewers to develop a general view of the reasoning behind their holdings.For law students, this is a great set in the sense that you don't need to try hard to memorize why Marshall preferred a strong national government or why Black is a strict originalist. After understanding their political view under the historical background, the answers are obvious."
5,"Great, Informative Set","this is a Great, Informative, Fun Set. Hugo Black shines! Where are our current Hugo Black's?"
5,Awesome stuff!,"This is the good stuff. I had known about the benefits of guarana for some time, since some of the original ""energy drinks"" like Josta. However energy drinks (even the lo-carb versions) all have jitters or crash. My wife bought some guarana powder a few months ago, and since then I've replaced my morning energy drink with a protein shake with a spoonful.All the energy, no jitter or crash. Awesome. As for the product specifically, the guarana is quality. No chunks or impurities. The package looks small but is just very well packed. There is a legit 250 grams here which should last you some time.As with all guarana, you need to mix well. Mixing with a spoon in juice or something won't have good results. Blending in a smoothy is the best bet."
5,This is the real deal,"Better and much less expensive than any energy drink. Use this powder to power up your fruit smoothies in the morning. Forget red bull, monster, amp, nos, and all other expensive, sugary drinks. Pure powdered guarana IS the natural source. A teaspoon or two a day blended in to your juice and you are ready to jump start your day !"
5,Good,"Livraison propre et soignée, livraison rapide. Je suis satisfaite. Très bon service client merci beaucoup je recommande ce vendeur. Cordialement"
5,Squirrel on my shoulder,"I often wonder why squirrels have not been domesticated as pets. I have come to see them as my favorite species on Earth, and I have rescued a few baby squirrels in my time.This is a book about getting to know squirrels close up - one in particular - Sammy - a newborn ball of hairless skin and a not-yet unfurled tale.This book tells his story. There are pictures of him cuddling up to his human saviors / ""rehabilitators."" You see him being nursed by an adopting cat. You mostly see him as being unbelievably mischievous.Sammy is an orphan who enters a human home and human hearts. He overwhelms with high doses of cuteness. The photography is outstanding, but so is the subject. The images are crisp and the printing job does them justice.This is a must-have book. If you have the money, go for it, for whatever it costs, even $95.You might want to try Ebay, however. I bought mine there for $15..."
4,Into the Ice,"If you enjoy books about hardihood in exploration, extended sea voyages in small, ill-found and poorly provisioned sailing vessels and human endurance in extraordinary (if ill-advised and ill-conceived) adventures this is a book for you.Williams describes several hundred years of fruitless searchs for the Northwest Passage, describing not just the journeys but their social, political and financial backgrounds. This he manages with a surprisingly light touch and attractive illustrations of original charts and sketchs from journal entries made by officers and crew.I happened to pick up this book in a delightful bookshop in Sitka after 10 days in the jigsaw puzzle of coves, bays and rivers that is the west coast of Canada and Alaska, so the descriptions of the exploration of that area by Cook and Vancouver were especially resonant."
5,Great primary sources all in one volume,A collection of primary sources of documents during the crisis of 1914 and during the war.A wonderful cross-section of the documented and a brief but infotrmative overview of each.A great start for any research into the period.
4,Live is better,"Oceans is a good song, but the best thing is you get Why go, and Alive in the live concert setting, this is a must have for real PJ fans."
5,Best machine offered I found in web or stores.,"I made extensive research of many different brands and price listings. I decided on this machine because of the feedback left by others. I am not disappointed, it meets all the expectations others wrote about. I truly recommend to you this product."
4,mailbox,This mailbox was written up as having a lock on it...it didn't. I called the company and they quickly credited my money back. They responded quickly and appropriately. Thank you for that.
4,I JUST LOVE WILLIAM CONRAD--AND THE DOG!,"I actually got this first season in two parts. It reminds me a little of COLUMBO, since one of the producers is involved. I would rate the intro as the best of any show. I hope they release all the seasons! You can't beat the older crime shows. You see a lot of nice scenery, and at a slower pace. ENJOY!"
3,Doesn't read well on the Kindle,"I have been using this book for a few days now and find that the exercises are very good. However, because the publisher put the left hand fingering in the black fret-position dots on the chord charts, the charts are very difficult to read on the Kindle. I even put them on the Kindle reader on my desktop machine with a large display and the fingerings were still hard to read, although much better than on the Kindle's small screen.For that reason only I give the Kindle edition a three-star rating. The Kindle edition is much less expensive than the print edition and comes without the DVD. But still, a book of exercises written out in diagrams should have completely legible diagrams. If the left hand fingerings were written under the string on the diagram as I have seen in other books it would have worked better. I would have much preferred the classical guitar method of writing the fingerings next to the notes on the musical staff to this."
2,Kindle 3 version.,On the Kindle. It was too hard to read the illistrations even in landscape mode. Get the print version. Probably a great book.
5,Great,"This is a great movie. Some people might think it is dumb, but I don't. Do not watch crap like Saving Private Ryan, because this is the real deal. This shows what a Jewish family living during the holocaust had to go through. I goes into the 'secret annex' and all the cramped space they had to live through. Check out this and The Diary of Anne Frank which was just made on DVD 2-5-04, These are both really good movies."
2,"Riveting, but diappointing","Dramatic portrayal of the famous diary that showed the world what life was like for Anne Frank's family during an oppressive regime of terror.The actress portraying Anne Frank overacts and I found the overall performance less than it should have been. The drama was well acted by Mr. Kingsley who saved the film from having been way too long and poorly acted. Supporting cast was not too bad, but the whole film is too long for most people to sit through. This one is for the History Buffs."
5,very powerful,"This is one of the more powerful movies made on the life of Anne Frank. It looks at Anne's life in Amsterdam before the war, her time in hiding, and what happened after they were betrayed. the scenes in the camp are very hard to watch. the final few parts in the camp had me in tears and I normally do not cry during movies. I suggest everyone sees this movie. It will change your life to some degree."
5,MOVIE IS WONDERFUL,"I have seen this film when it aired on ABC, and I thought ABC/Disney did a wonderful job with it. This details the life of Anne Frank, in a very neat and wonderful way. You must see it!"
4,Anne Frank - The whole story,"At first, I bought this DVD because I love the story in the period of II World War, especially in Europe with Nazi. This film let me see all the image that passed through this period.I forgot the name of the girl who plays Anne Frank, She is Extra. This film is not easy to understand in detail and also not commercial. It need theconcentratation till the end. It seems there are two or three versions with the same title But this is a good one, interesting diary writen by Anne. If I would be in 1940."
5,Anne Frank,"The Anne Frank movie was amazing!! I watched, I cried and I loved it, I absolutely hope everyone sees this movie. It will melt your heart knowing that a little girl and others went throught such terrible acts from other human beings, this is sad to know but its very necessary for us to live a life of repect and love for one another, just like our Savior said. Thank You,"
4,AS POWERFUL AS SCHINDLER'S LIST ( Anne Frank 4 1/2 stars),"Anne Frank gets 4 1/2 stars, NOT 4.ANNE FRANK is the powerful story of a teenage girl put through the horrors of the concentration camps. This is the only movie I have ever seen that made me break down and cry. This movie in some ways is more powerful than Schindlers list because it put these people in prospective. It felt like you knew Anne, so you felt what she was going though throughout the whole movie. Disturbingly powerful, I loved this movie."
4,REAL LIFE,"I really liked this film because it brang to life the diary of Ann frank and made you imagen how bad the Germans where to Jews. eithen thought this film was sad what made it sadder was that it was a true story, also that if they would have stayed alive a little longer then thay would have survied..."
5,Amazing!,"It's been a long time since I've watched this movie but I remember seeing it as if it were yesterday. Not many movies about Anne depict her life after the 8 were arrested aka her life in the concentration camps, Bergen-Belsen to be specific. This video is top notch and has the best actors you could wish for. It's also amazing that they actually look alot like their characters, especially Hannah Taylor-Gordon as Anne and Ben Kingsley as Otto Frank. More I cannot wish you to get this movie if you want to watch A video about Anne's life ay home, her Secret Annex, and the camps."
3,Good TV movie,"Ben Kingsley is one of the great actors of our time. His performance here as Otto Frank conveys quiet strength in the face of unfathomable sorrow. But the episodic nature (where the commercial breaks are too obvious) and the tour de force allotted to young Hannah Taylor-Gordon verges on becoming a pity-party. This is, after all, a Disney film.Would I use it in the classroom? Probably not, because of (brief) bare breasts in the concentration camp, and because the teleplay by Kirk Ellis [""The Three Stooges"" (2000)] plods toward the inevitable without capturing the irrepressible spirit that the unfinished diary leads us to believe ought to be there. One ought to feel uplifted by Anne's presence; instead, one feels, ""What a waste; bad Nazis!"" True enough, but that's only part of the story."
4,Good Movie,This movie gives a good insight on what Anne Frank went through during this horrible time. I only wished to see more of the wide spread result of Hitler's insanity.
5,Anne Frank The Whole Story,"this movie is amazing i loved it and it brought me to tears, this is very good and well made. my teacher showed it to our class in 8th grade and i went right ahead and bought it for myself. although some of the scenes are very graphic and shows brief nudity it was well worth the purchase. i showed it to my entire family and i had 4/5 people in tears including myselfWould Recommend to ANYBODY 100%"
5,anne frank the whole story,"there is more to the story if anne frank and her diary. this is family that was well off and forced into hiding to escape hitler's attempt at genocide. we meet the franks 3 years before they were forced into hiding with other families in the attic of his spice business. we meet the people that were their lifeline while in the attic, having to remain silent during the day while the business was open. the story didn't end there. somehow, the gestapo got word of the people living in the shop attic and took the 'refugees' into captivity. the next years were brutal at the hands of their captors. Not all survived, and that is the rest of the story. award-winning actor ben kingsley is featured in the role of otto frank and lili taylor, whom we met in 'mystic pizza' with julia roberts, shines in her portrayal of miep geis, whose heroism gave the family a chance to avoid the concentration camps of ww11."
5,a beautifull film about anne frank,this lovely film follows anne from when she was like 10 years to her death at 15. it is so sad and uplifting at the same time. watch it you wont be sorry.
4,wiper mo-mo,"i'd give this item a 5,but they should say some thing about the circuit board,which is sold sep.(my c.board was good)everything else was great.i got the mo-mo sooner than expected"
5,"Engaging, funny, sexy book - leaves you wanting to read more","The first thing I did when I finished reading this book was to search for more books by this author. I gobbled up the second book as quickly as the first...Marly Chance has a light, engaging style that reminds me of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series. Her science fiction world is interesting and left me wanting to find out more about this planet, their culture and the role of guardians and trackers. If this world is so male-dominated and agressive, how do they govern themselves without endless fighting? Why is linking so necessary for the safety of women? Hopefully, Marly Chance will tell us more in her next book. I can't wait."
5,Good reading for those of you who like steamy novels,"Marly Chance is a young writer who definitely knows how to write great steamy novels. Oath of Seduction is a fast read with no extraordinary plot, but it kept me hooked from the first page to the last!If you are like me, looking for a hot read with a bit more than just emotionless get-to-the-act characters, this book should be for you. The futuristic setting reminds me a bit of ""Warrior's woman"" from Johanna Lindsey. If you liked this book and are up for a more risqué reading then do not hesitate further...And if you like strong woman with strong personality that keep men at bay with snappy retort, read the 2nd book of the series: Oath of Challenge (have a look on her website marlychance.com)."
4,Light and erotic and an enjoyable read,"I bought this book wanting some spicy erotica, and the book delivered exactly what it promised - hot sex in a futuristic fantasy setting. It seemed to be more suited to short-story format, rather than a whole novel. I certainly hope that the sequel will give Chance to opportunity to draw a more complete picture of the Shimerian world.I liked that face that Sharon, while totally shocked and out of her element, did her best to cope with the changes in her life, even though ""going out for a beer"" was indeed a stupid romance novel heroine things to do...All I can say was that the ""linking"" scene, with Tair, was definitely the hottest part of the book. I can't wait to read more about him in the sequel!I find it unfortunate that the smaller publishing houses have such difficulties with editing and quality control, but otherwise, this was a light and very enjoyable read."
4,Hot! If you are looking for something erotic...,"I loved this story. It is graphic and really sexy. In addition to a lot of sex, it is a love story about two people. The alien world and story created by the author is compelling enough to keep your interest between the sex scenes. I highly recommend this story."
5,Hot book,Both Oath of Challenge and Oath of Seduction are hot books. Great reading but not for the light rommance reader. I can't wait for the 3rd book.
5,Great New Author with New Ideas,"I've been a fan of futuristic romances for years (I hesitate to say how many), and am always looking for authors with new things to say in the genre. In my opinion, Marly Chance is one of the best new authors in this genre. She skillfully blends the two genres so that both the SF fan and the romance fan in me are satisfied. I'm looking forward to future work by this author."
4,4 1/2 Stars,"Note spoilers in this review.The alpha male character here has some very romantic feelings and dialogue that are nicely written in this story. At first I was a little worried with the main female being written as a mousy librarian which doesn't appeal to me, but it made sense as it was her excuse as to why she didn't live life to her fullest desires. I would have rated this story 4 1/2 stars if that awful linking thing wasn't in the story. It seemed counter to the Shimerian males possessive/covetous natures that they'd be okay with that level of contact with their mates and the intimate kissing later - if it had been an ongoing menage, that would have made more sense.Anyway, will definitely try the next one in the series.-----------------I just changed the title of my review to up my rating to 4 1/2 stars. I have found myself going back to re-reading this story quite a bit because the dialogue of Liken was so romantic and dreamy! His words definitely reinforced the title of this book!"
3,Good...,"This version of the CD is an Austrailian import. It includes Animal, Jeremy, oceans (Why the 2 ""Ten"" Tracks?) and Alive live at the 1992 Pinkpop Festival. If your in it just for the live track get the oceans single which has THE EXACT TRACK FROM THE SAME SHOW. It also includes 2 more songs from the 1992 pinkpop festival. If you are a collector, get it. If your just an average fan who wants the Animal single, get the US version which includes animal (Live) and Jeremy (Live)"
5,One hell of a rock song,"Of pearl jam's second album, 1993's ""vs"" animal aptly shows just how hard rocking pearl jam can get. Altough at first listen one might come to the thought that animal is almost an even flow pt 2, that is not the case. With it's catchy, yet angry vocals and a pretty impressive solo, animal to this day remains and one of pearl jam's carrer defying tunes."
3,"Interesting, but not mind-blowing.","I enjoyed this CD because of the genuine pain and resent I felt in Henry Rollins' angry prattle. But, I think Henry's trying just a little to hard at being a sophisticated intellectual type. His lyrics are kind of inept and silly, and the first CD is really repetitive. But, some parts are certainly interesting, such as when he talks about what it's like being on the road, and his experiences with women. Moreover, Henry's voice and his descriptions of mental anguish and personal torment have a kind of subliminal effect. You start listening to him and pretty soon you can relate to what he's saying."
2,No Protection,"While the case does feel very nice and is easy to get on, it offers no protection whatsoever for the inside or outside screens and the camera lens. The only purpose this case serves is to protect the casing which is not as important. Also, the edges slip off easily, so it constantly needs readjusting for it to stay on."
3,not what i expected,"SO the picture that they show is NOT what this product looks like. There isn't a space on the front for the ""M"" logo, like is shows in the picture.Also, the cover is poorly designed. The phone cannot close all the way, which i am afraid will put stress on the hinges. also, inside, the bands that hold it on interfere with navigation and texting! i will NOT buy again."
1,"Cheap, but servicable","Doesn't fit the keys, but has protected the phone well enough. I wouldn't get this one again, but it was super cheap."
5,Highly recommended!,"The case itself is fine, and my Razr V3 fits perfectly inside it. It has no effect on your ability to use the phone, but keeps dust and moisture away. All of the areas that need to be open and accessible on the phone are kept open and easily available/visible. Highly recommended!"
5,Center Line is Amazing,"I've read almost every one of Joyce Sweeney's book and I love them all, but this one is my very favorite. You will never predict what happens in this story and with the characters. The stereotyping is minor and seems to have been done purposefully, and it works perfectly with the story. The characters are flawed to different extents and are realistic and true to life. The plot is incredible; it will keep you guessing the entire time. You will think you know the characters and what you can expect from them, but they'll turn around and surprise you. It's amazing. You HAVE to read this book. I read it three times the day I got it. You won't regret it."
4,Great Book,This book is really good to have in the car or for planning a trip. It is really handy having the maps next to the description. Good accurate maps and great insight.
5,great book -- very helpful,We followed the book for a 5 day trip on the AuSable and it was very helpful. Reportedly the book will be updated and available soon in a new version.
5,Wonderfully helpful book,"What a great book! I am a beginner kayaker having never kayaked a river before - and was nervous even thinking about it. This book was very descriptive and informative. We did the Platte River from Loon Lake to Lake Michigan and it was a blast. Very relaxing. The maps of the rivers were great as was the description of the landings and portages. Looking forward to my next river, and this book will help decide which one!"
4,good but not the best,"This is my first review and im hoping I get some good feed back from this. Anyways this cd is worth the price if your a big fan of guitar instrumentals and a big fan of the series. As all great things are the have a down fall, this soundtrack to many bad techno tracks!!(3) That really makes it a pain to listen to some times but when it gets down to great songs that are hardcore like kill dog as a sacrifice to dog then you can see the musical genius behind it. Also The guitars are right on cue and the sound is awsome!!! I can say that this is the worst soundtrack of all, still has its great songs, but people might not like it because it conatains no lyrics at all. It also does things alittle different like add some kind of mood to the levels that it portrays. Whether it be the elegance of chase of irony, or the heavy sound of kill dog as a sacrafice to dog this is a keeper for fans and rock fans alike."
4,Awesome,"this soundtrack is great for those who love those awesome guitar riffs and solos from classic rock. no singing at all, but more focus just on instrumentation. but after a while, you don't really know which songs your listening to..they get sort of mashed together...i had to keep checking the cd case... but love the game!"
4,A great introduction to the sport,"This book offers a great introduction to waterfowling. It combines beautiful photographs with advice from a pair of experts on ducks, equipment, and hunting techniques. It is easy reading... I strongly recommend it."
5,a must for duck hunters,this is a great book for duck hunters especialy for people just getting into waterfowling.it has beautiful pictures of all north american waterfowl.also gets into everthing you need to know about duck hunting in some detail but is very easy to understand. a must for duck hunters!
3,A book worth having,"I have had my copy of this book for a while and I always take pleasure in picking it up. It is visually lovely, and gives a nice ready account of ducks and duck hunting equipment and technique.I would only like to see improvements in two areas. First, I think it would be worthwhile to include a section on dogs and another on the international variation of duck hunting techniques and lore. Second, a simple cooking guide under the same cover would also be a welcome addition to a well rounded presentation."
5,What every waterfowler needs to know,"As a British wildfowler, I found that this book gave an extraordibnary insight into the American ways of duck hunting. It is a book that I will be buying in some quantities to gift to my American hunting friends on my next trip stateside."
4,"the song ""Jeremy"" never ages; sweet surreal tune","i gave the CD only 4 stars because only the ""Jeremy"" song is my favorite, the other songs are good but did'nt sound the best to me; besides, 5 is the highest rating (heck, you aint gettin the best always! ;) Now, the song ""Jeremy"" itself, I'd give 5 stars mainly because I think I can listen to it anytime. I think songs like these are once-in-a-lifetime, it's something about that tune, surreal and always new... try it, you'll enjoy it."
5,footsteps and yellow led better just as good as jeremy,"i picked this cd up about a year ago not for jeremy, cause i have owned ten for ages but for the other two songs. Both of them are fantastic, yellow led better i had already know about from its radio play so i know i had a winner there. But the song that immpressed me the most and is possibley the best song on the album is footsteps. its a greatly song song with fantasic lyrics. This is a must buy for any pearl jam fan or fan of music for that matter. All three songs are fantastic. Also if your thinking of getting any other pearl jam single cd's get Merkin Ball, Dissident and the singles sondtrack all contain excellent unreleased pearl jam songs except for dissident which has some live pearl jam songs on it such as rearview mirror and even flow."
5,Incredible... Yellow Ledbetter is amazing.,"Without a doubt, Yellow Ledbetter is the best song ever written by Eddie and the rest.... I've never before heard a song so sad, and so uplifting..."
5,Yellow Ledbetter is worth it alone!,"1.) Jeremy2.) Footsteps3.) Yellow Ledbetter""Jeremy"" is an absolute perfect song, ""Footsteps"" just proves to you how amazing of a lyric writer Eddie Vedder is. If you listen to Temple of the Dog you will the music Stone Gossard wrote that Chris Cornell sings to. Now Eddie put his own words over that, and truly it is a better song. ""Yellow Ledbetter"" is my favorite PJ song and to most fans theirs too. This song is perfect, and it's the first song that Mike McCready wrote music to for Pearl Jam."
5,It took forever to find....,"Ten became one of my favorite CD's soon after I bought it. But, to be honest, Jeremy is one of my least favorite tracks on the album. So, there must be another reason I bought this CD. There is: Yellow Ledbetter. Few band produce the quality stuff PJ does and Yellow Ledbetter is simply the best of what they've released. I only wish I could've owned it sooner. You won't be disappointed."
1,VERY BAD DON'T BUY,keeps on dropping connections...gets stuck and you would have to reset...this is the worst router ever...do not buy..I wouldn't recommend it to anyone...
1,Keep resetting !!!,Everyday I have to manually reset this thing and do the setup all over again... it just seems to forget everything it stores during setup every now and then and then I have to start all over again... whew !! really tough !!product sucks !!
2,Not-so-good-gear,"The router looks nice , setup was ok . But as others remark it drops the connection just like that every now and then , and every couple of days you need to unplug it because it plays dead ( won't connect to the ISP ) .Now it could be many things as there are many parameters including ISP , cable modem compability and P2P usuage but I've done all I can ( firmware , forums etc. ) , neatgear support is not help at all and if i knew that I wouldn't buy it .And I'm still waiting for my Amazon-Netgear rebate 3 months after ."
3,Mac OS X users - you need to shell out money for drivers,"Yup...I know what is says on the box: wi-fi compliant and works with Macintosh. it does, and here's how:1. ignore ALL Netgear data and ""advice"".... worthless.2. from Netgear's own site, they say you have to go to Orangeware.com and download the OS X drivers... it's another $15 - fast and easy, but another $15 not advertised.3. on a Netware CD for the router, dbl-click on the html file to gain access to the router for setting the unit up... click/fill in as needed.Definately not an 'out of the box' experience for Mac types, but once working, it has done fairly well. I gave it a 3/5 because unlike others in this thread, it hasn't died on me (yet?). Would consider other vendors with recent hindsight.Regards,UPDATE: Well, it's been 90 days... and the router works fine, but the card died. Switching to Belkin. Save yourself the hassles. Lower my rating to <1 star."
2,I can't recommend this unit,Pros- Looks nice- Easy to setupCons- External ac/dc adaptor- Has problem dropping connections (possibly due to overheating). Netgear forums blasted this unit.- Was performing firmware upgrade and it failed to upgrade - had to send it back.Had to send unit back at own expense.- Netgear support has somewhat long wait times and the phone tree can be confusing.
2,Beware of upgrading the firmware online!,"This router worked fairly well - until I tried to upgrade its firmware. In hindsight, I should've downloaded the file and then loaded it from my computer. But, I accepted Netgear's invitation to upgrade via their site, online. Realizing the danger of interruptions, I had both my router and my computer on backup battery power, as a hedge against any power outage. What I hadn't counted on, was the loss of my internet connection - right in the middle of the upgrade! Now, the router has no IP-address, and no way for me to communicate with it. Netgear tech support was less than useless, once I could actually get them to reply. Their only advice: use the ""reset"" button to put it back to the factory settings - which I'd already tried, having read the manual myself. So, scratch one router. I went ahead and bought a Linksys to replace it, and it seems to be a lot more reliable anyway."
1,not worth the hassle,"I don't usually write reviews, but this product failed after just six months. I also had another Netgear router fail immediately. I just can't recommend them after all the time and hassle it takes to discover that your hardware is bad. I have an apple airport...and of course it ""just works."" I've ordered a Belkin pre-N and will report on its efficacy."
4,"Decent Setup, Great Range","The router was quick and simple to set up. The direction were clear and easy to follow. I had some difficulties with the card, but a productive phone call to Netgear solved the problem. Support was obviously from overseas, but patient and easy to follow. Great product! This is my first attempt at a Network and wireless is nice."
1,"Don't buy it , I tried 2 models and none worked !!!","This router is really fast when it works. Unfortunately, it reboots constantly, even after upgrading to the newest firmware. First, I thought it was defective so I returned it for a replacement. The second one had exactly the same problem. Neatgear has to work this out and release a new firmware upgrade."
1,I do not recomend this book,"We have a violant world out there now, why expose a already violant brain to this book. Not ment for a godly person to read. I left it in a airport, didn't even want it in my house"
1,Open Letter to James Patterson,"Alex Cross deserves so much better. Don't rush us through moments with his family, give him a less ho-hum case and give him a girlfriend with a personality. There were no decent females characters in this thing at all let alone anyone to compare with Kate (Kiss the Girls) or Jesse (Along came a Spider) And Gary deserved a much better swan song. The previous books had conflict, suspense and likable down to earth people, while this is just a mess of gore and explotation of a potentially great character. If you can't give Alex Cross the way I know and love him, I'd prefer if you never wrote another book about him again. I encourage others who feel the same to make themselves heard."
1,Graphic Gore and little else,"The premise sounded intriguing but didn't deliver. I found this is the book to read if you want to know what a body looks like after the facial skin is torn off--you get the idea. The shock value of frequent disembowelment and dissecting of victims was what was relied upon by the author to hold your interest. I could think of real page turners that are written without all this gore. I didn't find the hero likable or interesting, just muy macho. I give this one 1 star because the author can make you visualize the grossness of the murders quite well."
2,Kiss the Girls was the only good book in the Cross series.,"I've read the entire Cross series, and the only one that I truly liked was Kiss the Girls. Cat and Mouse read like a bad romance novel too many times. The other parts were a predictable suspense novel. The characters were stereotypes, you didn't care what happened to them. I also didn't like the structure of the book, how it was split into two parts. The only reason you might want to read this book is if you want to find out what happens to Soneji. Not that the plotline of Soneji/Murphy was written all that well in the other books. Kiss the Girls is a better bet than Cat and Mouse, and Jack and Jill wasn't too bad either. Kiss the Girls is more suspenseful and has a better story. Jack and Jill isn't as trashy."
2,Strong start and then a limp to the finish line.,"James Patterson usually writes fast paced novels that thrill you to the end. After Gary Soneji dies in Cat and Mouse, this book takes a nose dive. The second half of the book was a great disappointment. The identity of Mr. Smith is obvious from the beginning and the character is very uninteresting. Dr. Cross' insights into Mr. Smith's psyche and his so-called solving of the mass murders are ludicrous. For added drama, Dr. Cross and his family are viciously beaten (ho hum), but I never believed that any member of the family was seriously injured. Only a half-hearted effort is made to keep you in suspence. The end of the book was simply stupid. Perhaps if James Patterson made every chapter longer than a page and half, he would have done more character and plot development. Patterson can do, and has done, much better."
2,My first and last Patterson,"Having read so many raves about Mr. Patterson's work I looked forward to reading Cat and Mouse. What a disappointment! It was deficient in believability and good dialogue. Mr. Patterson, have you ever really listened to a little girl speak? Her dialogue was like much of the plot - unbelievable. I was bored rather than thrilled with the action when I was not being repelled by the brutality. The author really overreached in trying to scare the reader. I stress ""trying""; he did not succeed with this reader. Nobody seemed real - not even the ""good guys"". I was indifferent to Dr. Cross, Sampson and Christine as they seemed so inauthentic. Grandma was the only distinctive character. The writing is really quite amateurish, repetitious and cliche ridden. I gave it two stars for the rapid read it provided on a long plane trip. Next time I'll bring along a Jonathan Kellerman or a Susan Isaacs for snappy dialogue and engrossing characters."
3,A page turner I got tired of.,"It was a page turner, as are all of Patterson's books, but I can't say I really enjoyed it. There was a strange twist in the middle, but that seemed a little contrived. I have one more Patterson book on my ""to read"" shelf. After that, I think I'm going to another author for awhile for my mystery/adventure stuff. I will stick with Patterson's graphic novels. Check this out:Maximum Ride: The Manga, Vol. 1"
1,Pathetic,"One of the most pathetic excuses for a novel I have seen in a long time. I needed something easy to fall asleep, but the level of this book was just insulting. It was so bad that I had to post my first comment EVER on Amazon. Painfully obvious, completely divorced from reality, unconnected and patchy story, incomplete, childish... The hero is full of himself, his grandma is full of herself, his kids are too, the bad guys are full of themselves, essentially - everybody was on an ego trip: best, strongest, hottest and brightest. The characters had absolutely no depth, and while I know that these novels don't aim for that, it would have been nice to try. Descriptions mostly involve naming what food they ate. The most insulting part is where the author completely ignores the near-tragedy of a family, which keeps behaving and living as if they all only had a bad dream... Can we give a 0 stars?"
2,oh so bland.,ive read 2 books now of pattersons and both left me feeling like ive wasted my time and money. his characters are one dimensional. cross for example is as vanilla as they come....boooooring. the only thing that saved this book from a 1 star was a scene involving a dog house. one scene out of the whole book. every chapter involving cross fawning over his love interest ( his childrens principal) was laughably bad and merits skipping. the way patterson chose to create his villain was unoriginal. if youre looking for bathroom reading material and not a serious read this might be for you. otherwise save your money.
3,Clunky and repetitive,"The first third or so of the book is great. Alex Cross is a well developed, intelligent, likable character -- although, I do think James Patterson tries too hard to show us what a wonderful, unique person Alex Cross is. I got it after the second time, Mr. Patterson. The third, fourth, and fifth times just start to annoy.After the detective is taken out of the action, the story turns downward for the middle third of the book. What happens next is only loosely connected to what came before, the common threads being the two different killers' hatred for Mr. Cross and how driven yet unoriginal the two killers are.Somewhere near the last third of the book, Alex reenters the plot. Because he's such a great character, the author managed to save what would have been a less than mediocre book.The book has the feel of a rush job, something the author didn't have the time or desire to work on. This book is really two noveletes stitched together with the seams still showing."
3,Overhyped,"I will KISS (Keep It Short and Simple): (spoiler warning)Soneji and Mr. Smith seems indistructable villians, but their endings are rather dissapoiting. Soneji was killed in the middle of the book and wowed to kill Alex Cross from his grave, the threat was real, but the execution is rather weak (Soneji's friend did the dirty work, yeah right...).As for Mr. Smith, the way he left the ""clues"" are rather laughable. Dissapointed to see him resolve to killing himself -- which he failed -- he was shot by Sampson instead.But I must say the interactions of Alex Cross and his family/lover/friends/colleagues are pretty nice. Unfortunately this is a Detective novel, not suppose to be a love story... :(Should have been better."
4,cat-a-roo,"This book was very well written mystery thingy of death. It kept me interested for just about the whole entire thing. It's a fine book and if you have the time to read a book about cats and mouses...but not...then read it...or don't. I really don't care, I'm just bored as balls right now!"
5,"EXCELLENT!! One of the best books, suspense-wise, I've read.","I sure wish James Patterson could write as fast as Danielle Steele! I can't wait until his next book arrives. Cat & Mouse will surely be a major motion picture. So suspenseful!! Everyone I've loaned my book to agrees and now they're Patterson fans just like me. K Pacheco Attleboro, MA"
3,Nothing new if you have read the other Alex Cross novels,"Patterson seems to be trying to capitalize on the recent interest in his Alex Cross novels (due to the movie Kiss the Girls) by trying to pump out another Cross novel. If you have read the other 3 Cross novels (or any of them, for that matter), you will find nothing new or surprising here. In this one, Cross actually gets hurt and, as in the other novels, gets involved in a romance. ZZZZ!!"
4,A weaker addition to the execellent Alex Cross series,"I felt a little letdown by the eventual confrontation with Cross's nemisis - Soneji. The build up was superb however the actual final meeting was not on the scale I had imagined. Mr Smith was uninteresting. His identity obvious from the start. The chase to catch him was uneventful, and the other characters such as Sampson and Kyle Craig were greatly under used. However as always the narrarative flows at a superb pace, and although not as good as the previous novels , roll on the next case."
1,A complete waste of time and money,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. As two other reviewers noticed, Patterson makes excessive and superfluous use of both italics and exclamation points. Very tacky, not to mention annoying. The characters were insipid and the plot was fragmented.I bought this book at the grocery store because I needed something to read. I would have been better off reading the instructions on my bag of rice."
3,Not bad...an average Patterson's thriller...,it's a book for late lazy sunday afternoon when there is no football on t.v.
4,Another Great Cross Story,"Wow .... I am reading the Alex Cross series in order and there has not been a bad one yet. Cat & Mouse is another excellent thriller with converging story lines and terrors. Patterson gives us great characters to care about - including Cross and his kids, his partner and best friend Sampson and, of course, Nana. The killers in the book are pure evil (Lechter-like) and their methods of murders are often heinous. Can't wait to pick up the next in this series!"
1,never delivered,a Christmas gift for my adult daughter...thanks a lot...it still isn't here and i ordered it in plenty of time...today is 12/21...need to make it up to her? send her the entire series at your expense...i am so disappointed...so disappointed
4,"Poor recording, but an exciting story","I have not read many of Patterson's Alex Cross novels, but those that I have read so far have generally been exciting and suspenseful. Cat & Mouse was no exception. As always, I can live without the sex that Patterson inevitably includes but without a doubt he knows how to write a thriller that will keep you on your toes. One downside to this audiobook was that the quality of the recording was not that great--there are two readers and they were obviously recorded in different conditions; the two recordings just did not seem to blend together very well.Overall, while the poor recording quality was distracting, I did enjoy this book and look forward to listening to more Patterson novels soon. His books, with their short chapters, really do work well for my commutes."
4,Cat & Mouse for Kindle,"This was my first book back in the 'Alex Cross universe' in over a year. It was also my very first complete read on the Kindle. With regards to the Kindle version, there were typos. Words were just flat out wrong, looked was used in place of locked, etc. It was only ever one word so it wasn't too distracting but it was still a little jarring to get in to a rhythm of reading and then stumble upon one of these typos.Aside from the imperfections in the Kindle version, I thought this was a very good book. James Patterson keeps you interested cover to cover. He has a writing style that I love, consisting of a lot of very small chapters. Which is great for people who might just want to grab the book to read for a few minutes. It gives you a natural stopping place.I would recommend this book to a friend, but would advise them to start at the beginning of the Alex Cross series (Along Came a Spider) so they are up to date on the back story."
1,Defective DVD,The sound went out half way through the darn thing. I may have enjoyed it more if there was sound...
5,Best Alex Cross Book Yet,"Anyone who likes Alex Cross or James Patterson will love this book. It's scary, suspenseful, and amazing!!! I loved it!!!"
2,A real disappointment!,"I'd never read any James Patterson before, but was in the mood for some light, easy fiction. What I got was so poorly written and predictable that I couldn't believe that it's on the best seller list. The plot is boring, at best, and the characters are so cliche that the book becomes irritating after the first few chapters."
3,A Let Down,"I has been anticipating this novel for about 3 months, but when I finished it I wondered why. Patterson started off great, but with too many insane twists and turns, I would have too say that he failed."
4,With Alex Cross as the main character how can you go wrong,James Patterson continues to keep me at the end of my chair with every book. Once you begin the book it is almost impossible to do anything but finish it. I also really enjoyed this book because of the scenes in New York which I could imagine so vividly.
3,Great at First...Then it stinks,"At first, I thought this was one of the best books ever written. I read the book constantly for the first day that I picked it up and all of a sudden it got to be the worst book I had ever written. Patterson reveals who Mr. Smith is, with about 150 pages to go and then the entire thrill of the novel is gone.The case of Gary Soneji does carry the book. I give the first half 5 stars and the second half 1 star. So that gives me three stars. His next one (Pop goes the Weasel) is much better."
3,looking for a nightmare?,"""Cat & Mouse"", by James Patterson, aims to be a thriller. You will realize how twisted, crazy, bizarre, and extraordinarly interesting this book may be, as it slowly pulls you away from your personal world. With unthinkable settings and vivid descriptions, this book will grip you from beginning to end. Character development is sacrificed for the thrills, however.A notable facet of the story is that author James Patterson writes in first-person from several people's point-of-views. At times a reader may be torn apart wondering which side he is supposed to be on.If you're looking for a bizarre plot with unpredictable twists, this is a book to read. However, after your first time, this book is no longer interesting. It's a one-time-reading, so enjoy."
4,Good follow up - but I have a question ...,"I found Cat and Mouse to be almost as good as Along Came a Spider - and that's saying a lot! Here's my question for those of you who have read this... I must have been falling asleep when it explained how Gary Soneji got out of prison, can anyone tell me where to find it in Cat and Mouse? After finishing the book, I scanned the first few chapters but couldn't find it. If you know, please email me at unman@home.com Thanks! This was a very fine book."
3,Eh I've read better,"Okay, I really liked his other three Cross books. I also REALLY looked foward to this one. I pick it up and am intrigued by Soneji. I liked that part. I also liked the injury--new detective part. But then I got to the motive of the second serial killer and I felt like I was watching something with the plot value of the 60s Batman series. Read everything excpet the final part and the book is great."
3,"Predictably violent, predictable ending","Having read others of Patterson's books, I'm not exactly sure why I picked this one up. I find way, way too much gratuitous violence, weak characterization, little if any motivation for crimes, a flirt with psychology, and basically a lot of bad Nero Stout look-alike vocabulary. It is not a BAD book. I particularly like Patterson's habit of writing VERY short chapters. I can put it down anytime and not miss a thing!!"
2,Skip It!,"The only reason I finished this book is that it read so quickly, much like finishing a really bad movie on the USA network. There were just too many holes in the storyline. Too many instances where the serial killer could have been caught (maybe Patterson should have studied up on the FBI's techniques and the technology they currently have). First Patterson I read...and the last."
5,The master of the nonstop nightmare has done it again,"Patterson has done it again. He brings back his brilliant detective hero, Alex Cross. Cross must once again match wits with his nemesis, diabolical madman, Gary Sonjei. Sonjei has vowed to kill Cross and his entire family. Cross battles his enemy from Washington to New York. This novel also has a great subplot about a equal brutal serial killer named Mr. Smith who is terrorizing Europe and the F.B.I. agent named Thomas Pierce who is obessed in catching him.This novel like the others boast suspense, great plot twists, and chilling villians. No one creates twisted minds better than Patterson. How both stories comes together is a testament of the storytelling power of Mr. Patterson. Another shocker worthy of Hitchcock!"
1,Waste of my time,"I can't believe I read this thing. This is nothing like his previous books: ""along came a spider"" and ""kiss the girls"". The characters in those novels had personality. This book was a repeat of the past novels, but more predictable and defiantly more boring. If you liked this book, you'll be amazed by his previous books on Alex Cross."
4,two books in one! Pierce warranted a book to himself!,"Enjoyed the book immensely, a pity I read it out of chronological order. Just had to read along came a spider immediately afterwards. Soneji killed off too early, i felt. Room for more suspense though wondering if he really is dead! Good escapism, doesn't pay to analyse the plot too carefully. Gobsmacked at the end!"
1,Patterson is much better than that !,"Those who've read Patterson's Along Came the Spider or Kiss the Girls would expect a good thriller and suspense. That's not what happens with Cat & Mouse. We go through several attempts of describing horrible acts on a supposed psychological persecution and some bad interpretations of the evil human mind... mixed to a flawless familiar life where Alex Cross's girl friend and children are beautiful, intelligent and perfect. Our hero Alex Cross is the best detective in the force and can do everything, including play a piano like Liberace!! It's too much ! For those who read other Patterson's books, this one is very disappointing."
3,"Worth reading, but not his best work.","I've read every Alex Cross mystery and they've all been a great thriller ride ... lots of suspense, interesting characters, good social commentary ... that leave you wanting more. ""Along Came a Spider"" is by far the best of the series and probably one of the best thrillers I've ever read. ""Cat & Mouse"" had some great parts, but I thought bringing back Gary Soneji was a short cut to crank out another book. The story surrounding him lacked a certain level of the ""grab you by the throat"" suspense I'm used to in a Patterson novel. The parallel story was interesting and definitely suspenseful, but its ending was disappointing and didn't really tie up any loose ends about how the killer was driven to such insanity. To Patterson's credit, though, the book's ending left me anxiously awaiting the next installment in the Cross series."
4,Another book I couldn't put down.,"Once again Patterson has proven that he can keep a reader on the edge of her seat and interested in every tiny detail he writes. I enjoyed stepping into the life of Dr. Alex Cross once again in the this next book in the Patterson series involving the sharp detective and criminal profiling skills of Dr. Cross. The way Patterson is able to bring so many dimensions of the character's life to the reader helps establish a relationship between the two. I like the fact that Patterson writes short chapters, moving quickly from one scene to another. Patterson has so many puzzel pieces scattered throughout his story that it amazes me how he always seems to bring everything together in the end. This is another great book by a great author."
1,Shallow and predictable,"This is the first Patterson book that I've read. I find it difficult to believe that Cat & Mouse flourished on the bestseller list. The characters have no depth and the plot seems to be put together as the book was written. It seems there was no idea put forth before the book was started. Usually, if I read a book by an author, and I like the book, I will read more books by the same author. In this case, I was severely disappointed and I do not plan to purchase any more Patterson books in fear that it is written in the same poor style."
1,"Unbelievable characters, wooden prose","This may be the worst book I've ever read. I thought it would keep me entertained on a 12 hour flight, but I struggled to finish it. The characters were so one dimensional and unrealized that I didn't really care whether they lived or died. All characters were caricatures, not people. The plot severely strained my ability to suspend disbelief. This is an absolute stinker of a book."
4,reader,Another great novel by Patterson. All of his books are easy to read and hardly ever make you wishing he would get to the point. I almost did not want this book to end but all good things must come to an end... He keeps you suspended and the details he gives make you wonder if you saw the movie or read the book...
2,Just another Alex Cross book,"This is just another Alex Cross book, except this time it's not as good. The book went really slow and had a poor plot which was confusing and quite predictable as the book winds on. It's one of those books which you can't put down but which never ended."
1,"dire, plotless and amateur","The first few James Patterson novels were excellent. This seems to have sapped his creative juices dry as the plot in this book held less intrigue than an episode of Scooby Doo. Clumsy writing, annoying constant chapters (cheap trick to convey fast paced action.. perhaps writing properly would help instead???) and halfway through the book a moment that has you howling with laughter, with so many changes of narration perspective I gave up trying to work out exactly who was spouting what...Very very disappointing - in the corner Mr Patterson and wear this pointy hat...."
1,"Good plot, but tarnished by obscenties and violence","When I bought this book, I thought I would be getting a good suspenseful story. To be fair the plot was very exciting and constantly kept you turning the pages. I think the short chapters and the storylines were very interesting. However, I got a lot more than I wanted. The language was explicit, the violence gruesome, and the sexual references obscene. Surely, the book could have been a lot better without these things. They were completely unnecessary. I was so disgusted I threw the book out and was mad I had wasted my money on it. It would be better to spend money on books like John Grishams' The Partner. It offers the suspense without everything else."
2,First and last Patterson I'll read.,"Wow--two serial killers for the price of one! But this ""doubling"" technique diminishes both stories. I was surprised to learn Patterson has several books to his credit. For much of the first half it seemed the author was saying ""Golly gee! I'm a writer!"" The characters have no real distinguishing features--none stand out. I felt uninvolved, distanced from all of them. It read like a movie script--one quick scene after another. Lost interest several times. Skipped many of the ""sensitive"" (boring) scenes. The ending of both killers were anti-climactic cop-outs. This should have been stronger considering the subject matter. I'm disappointed."
3,"Great beginning, poor ending","James Patterson starts his book well. He has a lot of suspense and a lot of action, but the end leaves something to be desired. He lets the book go; it's as if he just got tired of writing and ended it quick. He really should have spent more time on the ending. He rushed it."
3,The car trip got longer -- not shorter.,"Interesting plot that had gore to keep you interested. Took way to long too cover the plot. Wanted the tape to finish a couple tapes prior to the completion. Had a fatal flaw because the cops knew of someone who existed that only the criminal knew about - it was the last ""straw."" Maybe it was covered in the book."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read.,"I used to like James Patterson. In the past few years, however, his books have become increasingly tedious, predictable, and boring. This one is the worst. Its badly written (I don't think he has any sentences longer than about 10 words, and he certainly doesn't have any chapters longer than 3 pages) I only bothered to finish this book because I had paid full price for it -- which compounded my mistake; I not only wasted my money, I wasted my time."
1,Mainstream Drivel With An Obvious Ending,"I could tell right away who the real murderer was & why & how they would catch him. This man does not know the meaning of suspense. Since only the bad guys seem to have any spark, I found myself rooting for them instead of the blandola hero. If the FBI is actually as clueless as depicted in Patterson's novels, I fear for the welfare of our country's citizens. And the sappy romance without the smallest element of originality (all the men find only supermodel-type women endearing) was just more than I could bear. As they smooched, I retched. The writing was so bad that the lame story loomed even lamer in the landscape of bad books the American popular presses keep popping out."
2,"overdone! Needs focus, direction.","I found this book more convoluted than an elephant's intestine. It had ""I'm writing for Hollywood, hope the studios are looking at this"" written all over the watered down, overcooked story story. Gary Sonjei had AIDs, this was supposed to be ravashing his body, yet he showed no signs or the overused disease. It was gratuitious, as were all of the chase, shoot 'em up scenes. The tale lasted too long, needed a couple of hundred pages cut, several characters who added nothing but names and cinfusion needed to be edited out. Killing the villain (Sonjei, who was cheapened in this tale) early on, stopping the story to inject the love scenes, introducing another villan for the second half of the book, showed how unfocused Mr. Patterson really was. It felt like he did a cut and paste from scenes he didn't use in other novels."
1,Will never read another,"This book exceeded every preconceived notion of how bad a book could be. James Patterson seems allergic to both long sentences and chapters, giving it a feel that it was transcribed from Morse Code on an old telegraph machine. The bad guys are one dimensional. The good guys are one dimensional. The plot is thin and contrived to the point of hilarity. Nothing about this book is convincing except in removing all desire to read another book by him. Avoid at all costs!"
1,Had to force myself to finish it,"It took me three months to read this book. No, I'm not illiterate, I just let it collect dust on my bedside table while I started and finished other books. Alex Cross had no flaws, the villians had no redeeming qualities. There was no twist, no suspense--it's not that I guessed who the killer was in the beginning, I just didn't care. Maybe I'll try another Patterson book in the future, but not until the boredom Cat & Mouse produced fades from my memory."
4,Cat & Mouse,I wanted to check if this was as good as the other Alex Cross titles and it didn't dissapoint me.
1,Just a very short question??,"I realize that I just did a skim reading of this book..but somehowmissed something..Did it explain HOW Gary removed himself from a Maximumsecurity prison?? I may have missed it. Overall, this book was BAD!"
2,Disappointing read,"This was the 1st book that I read out of the ""Alex Cross"" based novels. Perhaps one needs to read the others before this one, however I doubt that it would change the outcome of this review. The plot dragged on like an old record. It was a struggle to finish. There is an interesting twist of events, however the sluggish journey to that twist is too long. The twist that could have been really great was almost matter of fact. Literally one minute the reader is bored stiff, then out of nowhere it's solved and over, seemingly with in pages of the end of the book. Very dissapointing read."
5,Cat and mouse,"great book, loved it, loved it. more of James Patterson i'm his fan for sure. Rebieanna"
3,"Ok, but check out the other 3 previous to this one.","It was alright, but it didn't hold a candle to ""KISS THE GIRLS""."
3,Not the best of the four Cross books,"I've read the other three Alex Cross stories and this book did not pack the same punch as the others. Note to potential readers: While you do not have to do so, I really believe it helps to read the books in sequence."
3,"A good Patterson story, but not his best","While this story started in true suspenseful Patterson form, it fell short at the end as it got too emotional and predictable. It was certianly not in the same league as Kiss The Girls."
5,5 Stars-AGAIN for Mr. Patterson!,"Mr. Patterson is an excellent writer. From the reviews of many of his readers at this site, I can see that most of them will agree with me. Although negative comments have been made about his characters and plots, I think that since it IS a book--NONFICTION at that--some things have to be overtly imaginative and creative to keep audiences' noses in the books. He deals w/ reality with a touch of unreality--enough excitement to keep the reader going. I praise him for stepping over the boundary of a white author with black characters, which is a big step in this arena. He keeps the characters real as possible w/o making them boring. He hits on all aspects of Alex Cross' life, which is reality--no part of one's life is separate from the others. Much prasie for James Patterson and his Alex Cross Novels! He, Sidney Sheldon, and Steve Martini are the masters of suspense!"
3,OK,"This wasn't as good as ""Kiss the Girls"". I was a little disappointed. The personal stuff drug on too long!!! This could have been a 3 hour book."
2,"predictable, overdone, confusing","I have read at least five or six Patterson books; this was my least favorite. I found the narrative confusing as Patterson switched from first to third person and then switched people narrating in first person. I was disappointed in the way he chose to end the Soneji episode and move to the Mr. Smith scenario. I would have liked to see more of Soneji. In that regard, I had the killer figured out before Alex did. And finally, I thought Patterson overdid the descriptions in the various bloodlettings that seemed to go on endlessly in the book."
3,"worth reading, but not as good as kiss the girls.","I am ready for for another cross book. this one(cat and mouse) was so how disappointing,especially the love scence between christine and cross,as well as the pierce character. I need more edgy stories :romance between cross and a white girl would have made the story as good as Kiss the girls and along came a spider, because america is still not okay with interracial love stories.so Mr. patterson write more of those controversial love stories in your book.still a worthy book to read."
4,I never would have guessed!!!!,This book was a great mystery. When you find out who the real murderer is it is so surprising. The storyline was good and the telling was great. This was the first James Patterson book I have read but I will definitely read more. Thanks for the great book. Couldn't put it down...A real page turner!!!
3,OK,"I am a reader who has enjoyed Patterson's books in the past. I am, however, becoming weary of Alex Cross novels. Patterson needs to work on more believable character development. Cross is the perfect detective, perfect, father, perfect friend, perfect grandson, perfect lover, perfect human. Uh-huh. And how many people with all of those traits have you met in your lifetime? His conversations with his children (especially his daughter) are so unbelievable as to be annoying. Character development is such a key, integral element; when it is weak, the entire piece of writing suffers. The plot is a nice blend of twists--albeit there are some holes but the plot is entertaining. I just do not feel that this work can stand on plot alone. I would not recommend that readers avoid this book but I definitely recommend they do not pay full price for it."
1,"I don't like Cross, OKAY?","To date, I have never finished an Alex Cross novel. He is remarkably boring and too predictable. Sure he's a detective with a heart of gold (He drives buses for poor kids, he slaves in the soup kitchens for poor kids...heck!), but he needs to toughen up. Anyway. Cat and Mouse is jarring, slow, and unimaginative. I think Patty is trying to escape the confines of Cross seeing as though several recent novels (When the Wind Blows, Cradle and ALL) have been offered. Oh! And who could forget that Diary one. I finish every Patterson novel that doesn't involve Cross, but I am however going to pick up Kiss the Girls, because I have heard that that one is a real, genuine corker. I think I might even buy the Diary one in paperback, because I know for a fact I will finish it. Cat and Mouse...nah."
2,Very disappointing,"Cat and Mouse went awry and James Patterson didn't have the time or desire to go back and fix it before the publication date.First, I'm not a fan of the Gary Soneji character who Patterson dotes on in all his novels. I liked having the threat of Soneji in Jack and Jill, but as a main character, he becomes a tedious, repetitious attempt for Alex Cross to create a psychological profile. It is plain annoying. Then Mr. Smith felt like a scrap of writing that Patterson had lying around that he wanted to use somewhere. The second, first person narrator through the mid section of the book was an obvious and unsatisfying attempt to attach it. Bad!What's good? I love the primary characters. Alex, Nana, Jannie, Damon, Christine Johnson are excellent. The relationships are outstanding. John Sampson is also a very cool character and was severely underused in this story. Tom Pierce got too much focus and Sampson was forgotten. James Patterson falls way short in this one."
4,Cat and Mouse,"Another good Alex Cross novel. Overall, the story is good, but I didn't like the way Gary Soneji ""went out"". The Mr. Smith clues that led to Alex Cross solving the puzzle was not the most believable way in which to lead someone to an answer. Still, the story is exciting and full of adventure and suspense."
5,cat & mouse,the Alex Cross series of novels by james patterson is always good reading. I read it in one day on my kindle
3,It's James Patterson and it's Alex Cross,"If you like the Alex Cross series from James Patterson, you will like this. It's typical of the series, and it will keep your attention and interest.However, the Alex Cross series reminds me of the soap operas on TV...there is always a bad outcome that (if you read the series) you could have predicted. Honestly, no detective would stay with the force if they got the number of threats, violent acts against self and family, etc., that are experienced by Alex Cross. If your family were subjected to the violence and fear you see in these books, they would all be in a padded room somewhere. No one with a lick of sense would ever allow this constant state of fear to be inflicted on their family, especially not their children!Although I like these books, I have found that I need a break from them after I read a couple. The outcomes become a little too predictable when you read too many in a row. This isn't great literature - it's just entertaining."
3,One word: Disappointment,"The fire that was written in ""Along Came A Spider"" has completely gone out in this book. The only reason I rated this book 3 stars is because my favorite villian of all time, Gary Soneji, is back. The book is good, but only for the first 1/3 or so. There are also some questions left about the Soneji character, but none as big as HOW DID HE GET OUT OF JAIL?? Patterson never touches upon this...Also, the Mr.Smith character is dull and flat, I never completely got absorbed with that part of the book. I became so frustated after (and at!) Soneji's demise that I threw the book. I guess I should have left it where it lie, because I was very disappointed with the remainder."
4,Patterson puts Cross into action AGAIN..,"In this suspense filled plot, Alex Cross goes after Soneji and Mr. Smith. The pages are once again filled with alot of action, some places did capture me and I couldnt put it down until that chase or fight or some other plot was over.I couldnt help but notice though, that the way Patterson was developing his characters sounded more like a movie script than a book at times.But still it's James Patterson, it's Alex Cross and it's definitely worth the read!"
4,"Explosive in first half, mediocre in the second","James Patterson, the masterful author of such great titles as Along Came a Spider and Jack & Jill has returned with a lukewarm title that I enjoyed in the first 200 pages but was not too impressed by the second 200 pages. I loved the fast paced short chapters of Soneji's violent rampage, but got bored by Mr. Smith. Soneji kills quickly in this novel, but Mr. Smith slowly kills in ver violent scenes. I also think that Soneji is not dead, and if he is, I will be disappointed evenen more. I would give the first half a 10, but the second half a 5. I would recommend people interested in reading Patterson to read either Along Came a Spider or Jack & Jill first, which in my opinion, are the best (Kiss the Girls ain't to shabby either) better luck next time, James."
5,Another page turner by James Patterson,"""Cat & Mouse"" is another page turner from James Patterson. Read it in two sittings. Have loved all of his books. I agree with some of the other reviews that ""Cat & Mouse"" isn't quite as good as ""Kiss the Girls"". His plot and happenings are starting to get to the edge of believability. He is a master at developing his characters - Alex Cross & family and bringing out their feelings."
3,Good plot,"The story line of this book and the action was certainly enough to keep my interest but I find that Patterson is not as much an excellent writer as he is a good story teller. His descriptions of the main characters or ""the good guys"" are just too good to be true. Alex Cross is perfect in every way and everyone in his life is brilliant, beautiful and loves him more than life. That can be distracting. I found myself rolling my eyes at the character descriptions and non-case related dialogue, but glued to the pages when the police work and crimes were unfolding. Patterson's books are sometimes like a beefed up Danielle Steele romance. If you can deal with that, it's definitely worth reading."
2,Cat & Mouse,"I think that James Patterson is a fine author who can write astory that will keep you enthralled, willing to know what is coming upwhich makes you, glued to your seat. This one however, I just purelyhated. The charcters were flat, so was the plot, being aspredictable. I consider myself a fast paced reader, but this thrillertook me at least 3 weeks to finish. The ending is believable andtastelessly brought on. Scratch that, the WHOLE plot and every eventis pretty much predictable. My worst regrets are A. Reading this bookand B. Not returning it.If I were the reader, wouldn't waste yourmoney on this tasteless, lifeless,... non-James Pattersonnovel. Sorry James Patterson, I pity you for even spending time towrite this book. Cradle and All was far better."
1,"Sloppy, unfinished effort","What do you get when you're way behind on a deadline and about to lose a lucrative contract? You get Cat & Mouse: two rough drafts of two different books slapped together and foisted onto an unwary public as a single finished novel.What an embarrassing effort. This book is badly in need of some serious editing. It is clumsily written and full of repetitions, more like something written by a junior high student than a nationally acclaimed author. There is absolutely nothing to recommend this book. The Soneji story is a major disappointment. Apologies should be made to Alex Cross fans."
4,Who is the cat and who is the mouse?,"Cat and Mouse is an epic and unforgettable story that will keep you on the edge of suspense. James Patterson unfolds a new murder story in front of your eyes making every detail vital to solving the case. Patterson starts his story in the midst of Washington DC where our protagonist, Alex Cross, works as a homicide detective. Cross is to meet his old nemesis, Gary Soneji, who has come back to take revenge on Cross and his family. He starts by killing innocent commuters in train stations without a pattern and tries to come for his family. He tries to draw Cross to meet with him so they can settle this once and for all. Cross must stop Soneji from killing innocent commuters and from killing his family. While all this is happening, a brutal murderer by the name of Mr. Smith is killing innocent people all around the world. Cross must team up with the FBI to save his family and stop those two heartless killers."
3,Typical Patterson,"This is my sixth Alex Cross novel. I did not read them in their published order, so certain character developments were lost on me. Regardless, I thought 'Cat & Mouse' was an enjoyable read. However, the first half of the book was so formulaic and cumbersome, that it made the plot twists toward the end necessary and less surprising. Patterson did a better job intertwining two plots and two killers together in this story than he did in later ones. But he seems to always create the exact same sort of predator and prey--he is by no means a diverse novelist. That said, if you're a developing Patterson fan or on the cusp of obsessive, pick up this book. Otherwise, there are far better reads out there."
2,Not the greatest,"This was my first Patterson book, and while I may still try some of his other works, this one was not interesting or gripping in my opinion. The character development was weak. The novel is full of twists in the plot, and has a few good moments, but the people seem too simple to really grab my attention. If you have not read this author before, I would try a different book first. I have heard that some of his other books are quite different from the books in this series."
3,"Okay for a quick read, but not exceptional","This was the first Patterson novel I've read, and I'm not sure if I'll read another one or not. First, I thought the murders committed in the book were overly-violent. If that's not something that bothers you, you may like this novel better than I did. The other thing that bothered me was that I found some of the plot twists a little beyond belief. I like plot twists that are cleverly constructed so I find myself thinking ""yeah, why didn't I catch on to that?"" not ""where did that come from?"". Maybe I missed something when I was reading the book, but I just found some of it too far-fetched for me. I did find myself wanting to keep reading, though, so it wasn't bad. I guess I just prefer other authors better than this one."
4,Alex Cross novel are my favorite,"I love the Alex Cross novels. I like James Patterson in particular as an author. The new Alex Cross movie is coming out in October, but Morgan Freeman will not be playing Alex Cross. I'm going to have to get used to a new actor.Cat and Mouse is one of the ones I haven't read yet. I'm almost 3/4 of the way through it now. I like Kindle because I can keep books with me on a single tablet and read them at my leisure."
3,It is what it is,"Cat and Mouse is what it is. With that in mind, I actually really enjoyed it and read it very quickly. James Patterson does get a little too trigger happy with ending one Chapter and starting the next, even though it's the same scene. It was never ""annoying"" during the read, but it was amusing in a negative way. The good news: while neither of the villains are especially original, they are both very entertaining and interesting people to read about. The twists 25% predictable, 75% surprising; in other words, definitely had an inkling of what was going to happen with major characters, but didn't quite know for sure. The dialogue is pretty weak, but the non stop, fast moving action makes up for it. If you're looking for a light read for a beach, this is a good option. No thinking cap needed. Straight up popcorn fun."
4,This one's not the big cheese!,"Patterson has a contrived story at best and this is certainly not one of his best. Alex Cross is our all-time hero and he's fleshed-out in this thriller becoming the warm, human person to which he has evolved. And we want to see him healing and on the road to happiness. What we don't want to see is a psychotic killer battering Nana Mama and the kids! This book could have ended with the end of Soneji very nicely. The addition of Mr. Smith was a contrived fiction that didn't add true value to the book and he certainly wasn't worthy of repeat performances as was Gary Soneji. Mr. Patterson should read his former Alex Cross books and go back to that winning formula."
1,One of the worst books I've ever read,"Seriously, I could not believe how bad it was. Really no redeeming values at all.The author uses exclamation points contstantly! Instead of writing to create drama, he uses punctuation! And italics!You learn nothing. It's a waste of time, unless you just want to shake your head and wonder that the book was ever published, or be motivated to write yourself, because if he's a bestselling author, surely you can be as well.Please stick to Elmore Leonard, Thomas Harris, Walter Mosley, etc., for your mystery thrillers. This one is just plain bad."
1,"Total waste of money and Boring, ...","Although I kinda liked Hide and Seek, had some doubts after having read Jack and Jill, I bought C&M. I did not even finish it. At first I thought it was some kind of re-write of Jack and Jill, but as I do not know the ending, ... Precious time wasted."
2,Unfortunately James Patterson is no Ian Fleming!,Alex Cross isn't 007 or even in his league. What a disappointment. No page-turning suspense. No shocker. No fun and games with the reader. Guess that's why Alex Cross never made it to the big screen. Save your money.
1,Abysmal.,"As a rule, I finish every book that I start. Thanks to this book,I may change the rule. This author stole 6 hours of my life from me that I will never be able to get back. A ""must miss""."
1,"Disoriented, contrived, disappointing.","Were it not for my rule to finish every book I start, this book would have been closed and put away long before Gary Soneji met his demise. Mr. Patterson piqued my interest with his previous books but Cat & Mouse was a big disappointment.The storyline was halting and contrived. The dialogue weak and not fitting to the characters. The editing was sloppy and contributed to an already weak plot that frequently wandered off into unsatisfying and unresolved tangents.The overall impression with which I was left was that of an author with a large advance, a tight deadline, a potential movie deal and no insight into where he wanted to take the story. Perhaps the story wasn't what was important to Mr. Patterson in this novel. We can only hope that the next novel will gain from all that was lost here. If not, the author has permanently lost a reader."
2,Two separate stories,"There seemed to be two separate stories in here that were only vaguely related: The hunt for Gary Soneji and the hunt for Mr. Smith. It was also suprisingly predictable. The novel also lost credibility with me when the author jumped from Alex writing in the first person, to writing in the third person, to the other detective writing in the first person. I think this was one of Patterson's weaker novels."
3,Patterson has written better,"Cat and Mouse was good but not nearly as good as his other Alex Cross novels. I absolutly HATED the ending, although the rest of the book was alright"
2,Have I read this before??,"Right from the start of this book everything seemed familiar..and I don't mean just the characters. Although Alex Cross is an interesting subject Patterson should change the plot of this detectives life/work more from book to book or move on. This book even refers to ""Along came a spider"" and the simalarities of the ""bad guy"" in both. I am a fan of Patterson's but I'll be sure to read the inside of the cover more carefully before buying next time."
2,Read this if you love graphic gore and little else.,"The premise of this one sounded intriguing. I found out that this is the book to read if you want to know what a body looks like after the facial skin is torn off--you get the idea. The shock value of frequent disembowelment and dissecting of victims was what was relied upon by the author to hold your interest. I could think of real page turners that are written without all the gore. I didn't find the ""hero"" likable or interesting, just muy macho. I give this one 2 stars because the author can make you visualize the explicit details quite well."
1,"Grim, violent and boring","This is the first book by Patterson that I have ever read, and I do not intend to buy another. This is also the first book in a long time that I made a conscious decision to quit reading after the first half. The story was grim, violent and boring. How did this get to be on the best seller list? It's brain garbage!"
2,This author can do better,"I must say after reading James Patterson's latest I was very disappointed. Really it is two stories combined into one. Niether of which is terribly indepth. While it is ""Finishable"" all I can say is better luck next time."
3,bad quality control,It was very difficult screwing the stem into the top part of the mirror.The threads were damaged.I finally had to use a pliers with brute force to get the two attached.I ruined the finish on the stem by doing so.The mirror itself is very nice.
4,What She Wanted,I bought this for my aunt. It was exactly what she wanted. I wish it were a little more stable. It seems to wobble a little and I wish it would telescope a little taller. But it came in good condition and she likes it.
2,Complicating a simple subject,"Although there is a plethora of information available through this tool and many interesting techniques, I found the workbook to be very complicated. Not to say that the information was difficult to comprehend, yet the action reading program somehow made the entire process of learning phonics more complicated than it should be."
2,"information is there but the presentation, is boring","Ms. Jeanie Eller is a pioneer in phonics education, and her information is right on. But personally from a teaching point of view, this approach is not very interesting to the student and needs to be more interactive in its approach."
4,Action Reading Fundamentals Home Phonics Tutorial Prog,"I really cannot give complete review, I have not had the class yet. But just looking over the product everything seem to be good."
2,Nauseatingly biased.,"Good footage, and overall a o.k. documentary, but the moments of unscholarly and silly slander in the commentary are too frequent to warrant owning this.There are many WW2/Nazi documentaries, and this one is a good example of why so many people think they can do it better."
3,Interesting,"Pretty good. Very interesting footage I'd never seen before. Had to cover a lot of ground quickly but as an insight into AH's personality it was fairly good. I'd also recommend the book ""Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics"" by Frederic Spotts. I was surprised at one error. It was stated that 6 million people died in the camps. Actually number is difficult but generally is considered to be over 11 million."
4,NO typos!,"This book jumps right into the action on page one.It then goes back and forth between the present and the past until the past catches up with the present.We learn a bit about Rebecca Schwartz in chapter two, but it is in chapter four that I really got to know and love her; she tells us about a shopping trip and takes us to her apartment.NOTE: Keep in mind this book was written in 1982 - thus the ""current"" fashions, nobody has a cell phone, you can't just Google something, and $25,000 was a lot of cash.There are NO TYPOS in this book, it has good editing and grammar, grown-up language - I don't mean swearing, I mean very little swearing and no young-adult slang, there are even some ""big"" words that sent me to my dictionary.This is a fun read and I'm going right on to book #2 in the series.This IS a good stand alone book, you do not have to read #2 to get any answers or closure."
4,Very enjoyable,"I'm going to go a little corny, and make a bit of a parody of a Taylor Swift song. No, don't groan, come on! I knew you were trouble when I started reading... Okay, fine. I won't sing, or make a parody.What I will do is tell you that Death Turns a Trick, featuring Rebecca Schwartz, is a mystery, adventure, comical, and so much fun! I'm one for cozy mysteries with plenty of things to guess about- that's what I got. Rebecca always lands in trouble, from what it seems. But she's got a good head on her shoulders, and add in her stubbornness and unwillingness to let go until she's figured out what she wants, and you've got a great mystery heroine.I enjoyed the book, and will most definitely be looking for more from Ms. Smith, especially if Rebecca is front and center."
4,Death Turns a Trick,"Cute story about the untimely death of a hooker and the connection to the accused murderer (her brother) and his attorney girlfriend. I found it interesting and entertaining if a little bit unbelievable. Some typos, but I can't blame the author for that. I'd give the author Julie Smith another shot."
1,Death turns a trick,"Don't waste your time on this one. Unbelievable plot, characters almost unbelievably dumb. I couldn't manage to finish it so maybe it gets better at the end."
5,Storm Surge by William Neil Martin,"I live in Gulfport,MS. The author has captured the realization of Hurricane Camille into depth. The book brought back memories of that night and the devastation for days afterwards. I personally was impressed on how the author mentioned local sites and locations in 1969, most of which no longer exist. Storm Surge is an exciting, fast-moving murder mystery. Outstanding book."
5,Nice Ride But Watch Out On The Install,"Shocks give a very nice ride but watch out on the install of the front ones. I sheared the left front shock mount off when removing the old one. I had sprayed it with PB Blaster but it still sheared off. Other side will be different, right. More PB Blaster and heat the bolt with a torch. Start turning and it's coming off like butter and then, there goes the other one too. No worries, just drill a hole in the existing stud and thread it to put a bolt in to hold the shock on snug. Watch out though, don't snap the tap off in the new hole. After one succesful adaptation that was my second mistake. Haven't corrected that yet but the shocks are great. Rears install like a piece of cake. On my 96 Ford Ranger pull the spare tire down to access the mounts easy. Great ride though!"
1,COUNTERFEIT,"As a Portmeirion collecter of twenty five years, I can assure you that these are counterfeit products. I received six of the drum shaped breakfast mugs. All were an off color. All the botanical names were typed in the wrong typeface and slanted. Even for fakes these are of partiularly poor quality."
3,Missing saucer,The package arrived with only five saucers instead of six. Now it will have to be returned. Lots of extra work and so disappointing.
4,Wow! Love these boots.,"I'm definitely a boot girl, so when I saw these camouflage boots for less than $30, I was psyched. They fit well and don't squish the toes but also don't make me look like I have huge feet. The side pockets ARE functional, so they're great when wearing pants/dress/skirt without pockets. I recommend getting some kind of padding to put between the feet and the soles of the boots, though; without a little padding, the boots are hard to wear for long periods of time. But, WITH Dr. Scholl's (or the cheaper equivalent), they're just great!"
5,This is a great introduction to Buddhism.,"This book approaches Buddhism from the standpoint of the Chinese Ch'an tradition, became zen when it was transmitted to Japan. It is a great book for beginners, and explains the basic beliefs of Buddism. It also emphasizes practice (the application of Buddhism to life), and especially meditation practice. It is one of the books I give away often to people who ask me about Buddhism."
2,Dissapointing and frustrating,"The bulk of this book is step-by-step guided exercises that I had hoped would demonstrate the myrad features in Photoshop Elements. A CD containing art work and support files required by the exercises is furnished with the book.Unfortunately, my experience with a half dozen exercises left me less than pleased. Some of the exercise steps described items in Photoshop Elements that didn't exist. In some cases I found things that came close... I think. My guess is the author was working with a different version of the program as he was developing the book and never went back to check things with the final version. A further complication were several instances where the instructions called for files on the CD that didn't exist. Finally, the author provides cookbook-like instructions without saying what it is you are trying to accomplish."
1,Not true does nothing for black heads,"this did nothing for me im better of getting black head remover strips from walmart then this! it did smell really good though, it made me want eat it then use it lol"
5,An ideal gift to the one you love and care,"The title of the book may be problematic without knowing the content. For those who love books of nature are likely to miss this one and for those who are serious readers on leadership may be disappointed. Perhaps a subtitle, something like ""thoughts of life through nature"" to go along with the main one is needed. Anyway, I love it."
5,Beautiful and thought-provoking. A superb gift for the boss,What an incredible adventure for the mind and the eye. The pictures enhance the concept of leadership and the concept of leadership enhances the meaning within the pictures.
3,Beautiful-- but deadly!,"BLAZING ANGELS 2: SECRET MISSIONS is a drop dead gorgeous game...with some of the most exciting airplanes ever invented...or NOT invented. Its a ""what if"" World War 2 scenario, pitting your team of Allied pilots in desperate missions against Axis ""super weapons of the air"". Its a lot like ""Crimson Skies""...and is a graphic joy. That being said, its almost incredibly hard. The missions are multi-part, and are sometimes so vague or confusing as to their goals, that you die or run out of the time-limits many too many times. Some missions mix straight forward bombing and strafing missions with incredibly difficult precision attack targets. Its fun, its challenging, but I found it ultimately frustrating. Now I'm an ""older"" gamer, and my reflexes are not up to the younger ""Top Guns""...so if you're a hot fighter jock, pick up ""Blazing Angels 2""...you'll enjoy the challenge."
3,Son loves it - Dad likes it okay,"I bought this game for my 10 year old son. He and his best friend (9) love it. I (46) play with him and think it's okay. No blood and guts, so that's good. Just a fly around in different airplane with ranging speeds, weapons and maneuverability (sp?) shooting the bad guy ships, planes and bases."
4,"A fun, challenging game","If you are like me and don't play many air combat games, this game will be a challenge and if you stick with it, one will continuously improve their flying and air combat skills. It has been, for the most part, an enjoyable play. I would have given Blazing Angels 2 five stars except for one thing: as each mission has several components, and takes awhile to complete, Ubisoft did not provide a way to save after completing each component, which was quite frustrating especially when I did not have enough time to complete an entire mission. If you have to quit the game, it would always resume at the beginning of a mission, not the next uncompleted component."
3,"Ok, but low res and maps are VERY small!","The game is ok, the planes could have been simple like a real WWII aircraft instead of adding tesla coils and guided air to air missiles on planes that should have been harder to fly and had realistic weapons.The missions were weak and the maps were easy to fly right ""off of"" (die). This game went from concept to product WAY too fast, they should have actually made at least 1 thing realistic!I would not recommend this game."
1,Excitement at the expense of sound instruction.,"There is no doubt that this book will hold kids' interest -- but it uses violence to do so, and that is not appropriate for advent devotions. As fiction, it adds considerably to biblical truth. It is hard enough to teach kids that the bible is not just another nice story, and this fictionalized account makes that even harder. This book can do more harm than good. Find another choice."
4,A Great Advent Book,This is fun to read aloud at Advent with the family. It's a nice story that follows a boy through a series of adventures leading up to the birth of Christ. It's divided into chapters that can be read one per night during the advent season.
5,Great devotional for advent,We are reading this book for advent right now. Our 5 and 7 year old boys are really enjoying it. It is exciting and suspensful. A great book to prepare our hearts for Christmas.
4,Excellent new family advent tradition,"I am an adult and read this the same time my sisters read it to their children.We are all in different cities and this was a great way to feel connected during the holidays. I thought it a little violent for some of the children (ages range of nieces and nephews 4-11) but everyone seamed to do fine. The thought provoking lessons are good for ages 4-104. I understand their are other books in the series---I look forward to next year.P.S. I must admit that I was so intrigued I sometimes read ahead--""bad Aunt Sherry"""
5,A Great Journey for Advent,"As all of the previous reviewers have said so well, this book is a wonderful book for journeying through Advent with children. I am sure that that is true. I, also, as an adult, have enjoyed using it for my own time of prayer. At the end of each story about a shepherd boy 2000 years ago there is an encouragement to apply it to our own journey to Christmas this year. I am a Catholic. I was raised a Presbyterian. And I believe that Catholics and mainline Protestants (Presbyterians, Lutherans, Methodists, etc.) alike will enjoy this book as we celebrate Advent."
5,Loved this book!,"This was our 2nd purchase of this book as a gift for someone we know. Our own copy of this book, we have used this story book readings for our family 3 times already! It is excellent story telling, by far the best of all Arnold Ytreeide's books (though all of them are very good). Nearly each story leaves you on a cliff hanger so you can't wait to read the next. The cultural and historical setting are very realistic for the time. This is a great resource for family reading times for the Christmas season. We have also read Ytreeide's - Bartholomew's Passage which was also very good and also ends at the birth of the Messiah. Amon's Adventure was a wonderful read as well up to the death and resurrection of Christ. We are looking forward to Tabitha's Travel's this coming Christmas!"
4,full of suspense but also contains bible lessons,"I really liked this book. It is divided into 25 days for advent I and found myself wanting to read ahead because there seems to be a cliffhanger at the end of each day's reading. There are several plot twists, some I saw coming, some not. There is a lesson at the end of each day's story, most with verses from the Bible.My only complaint about the book is that the villain, ""Decha of Megiddo"" is like Freddy Krueger or ""Jason"" from the ""Friday the 13th"" movies, he just keeps coming no matter what injuries are inflicted on him. The author even seems to forget that he should be injured and not able to do things he does at the end of the book. But your kids will probably forget too.And of course, it's only really good for one year because after that your kids will know what's going to happen. The daily lessons are tied in with the story, so they wouldn't be as useful by themselves."
5,Family Advent Tradition,"This book was out of print for a while, and I was happy to see a new publisher pick it up. Our family incorporates this into our Advent traditions, reading a section each night (as laid out in the book). At bedtime, our three kids (ages 4-9) sit while I read, and even my husband sits in (and reads to catch up if he misses a night). Each night ends on a suspenseful note, so the next evening the kids get ready for bed in record time so that we can read that night's story (finding out how last night's climax was resolved, and again ending with them wondering what will happen next). It is a family strengthening story and tradition for us. This is one in a series of three books (Bartholomew's Passage and Tabitha's Travels are the other two) which we rotate over three years, then will start the cycle over again. I bought these two copies to give as gifts."
2,Very limited stopwatch,"This stopwatch has one very serious defect. If one wants to time individual laps and then read the accumulated time at the end of the event, he is out of luck.I suppose most stopwatches have multiple timers to perform this task; even cheap watches can usually do it, though their buttons and displays are too small for easy use.It never occurred to me that the feature would be lacking in any modern digital stopwatch.If you need that feature, beware."
5,I can see in the dark,"These night sights are awesome. Reputation speaks for itself. The only problem is Meprolight warranty is only good if you fill out the waranty, send it in and post mark it within 10 days of purchase. When it takes 10 days to ship from Amazon your warranty is worthless."
5,Norton Antivirus,Norton Antivirus 2007 downloaded to my Dell XPS no problems. My dell came with Norton.Excellent product
3,The dilemmas of the working mother,"This is a story about a woman who is torn between her responsibilities as a mother and wife and as a doctor. She witnesses tragedy and pain, and superstitiously believes that if she tries really hard to fix all that, her son would be spared. She becomes so immersed in this belief that eventually her marriage falls apart and her family fragments. This book is successful in explaining how highly intelligent and educated people can make horrible decisions based on nothingness. I think Perri Klass does a very good job portraying the love that a mother feels for her child. In many instances the main character is caught relishing on her beautiful son, and her love is expressed in many sweet ways. The plot is interesting, not a page-turner, but this is nonetheless a good book to take along in a long flight, or to read by the pool."
4,Intereting this FATS CD,"Many changes in the ""Stop"" settings while playing, keeps the selections interesting. Shows the many voices of the organ. Same tempo during most of the selections, could have mixed in some quieter/slower for a change of pace. (Try George Wright for example.) Consequently, this CD can get tiring if used as background musik while working or doing other activities. But, since I am an organ enthusiast, I am generally happy with this CD. It plays well on by car CD."
3,FATS AT THE ORGAN,"ALTHO THE RECORDING IS OF EXCELLENT QUALITY , I PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT HAD I KNOWN THAT IT WAS RECORDED FROM GINKED UP PIANO ROLLS. I THOUGHT IT WAS REMASTERED 78'S WHICH GIVE A TRUE PICTURE OF HIS ORGAN TECHNIQUE.THE SERVICE FROM THE VENDOR WAS.HOWEVER.EXCELLENT."
4,Design With Models: A Studio Guide to Making and Using Arch,Gives helpful methods of design methods intergrated with the model creation process. Things such as representation of materiality and techniques in the process of model creation are described. Very nice tool for those looking to branch their technique past 3D/2D computer and hand drawing design.
3,Great for beginners,It describes materiality and techniques for model creation but quality of the picture in this book is poor for the price i paid.
2,"Conceptually sound, but not particularly specific instructions","I used to require this book for a class I taught. As an advanced model maker, I found it quite interesting, but my students complained that it was not particularly helpful in terms of ""how to"". I have since changed my required textbook."
1,"very disappointed. I received an old version, not the one offered online.","I tried to contact the seller but never responded. The item received was an old version, not the one claimed online."
3,"Beautiful pictures, but...","The quality of these cards is great and the pictures are stunning, but I wasn't happy with the collection of animals. I had purchased them, expecting to get a set of animals familiar to a young student, but instead, most of the animals were quite obscure (a few I hadn't even heard of) and there was very little variety; mainly reptiles and aquatic life. Maybe they'll come in handy when my kids are quite a few years older, but for now I have a stack of 56 cards, with maybe 3 North American animals."
3,Love the details,I love the detail of these flash cards and the pictures are great but they are so thin that I cant let my 2 year old use them. He bends them all up
1,Kookery,"Sadly, a rather predictable Christ-myther rant. Typically for the genre, the author has not consulted any primary sources, choosing instead to focus on publications of dubious authority, from hyper-Presbyterian polemic (Hislop's ... more ""The Two Babylons"") to confabulated works of ""freethinkers"" like G.A. Wells, whose own works are full of assertions that are not and cannot be bibliographically supported. Even the title of the book is less than honest : far from being an examination of the evidence, it is a jaw-dropping tour through a psyche so distorted by its own assumptions that it is literally incapable of entertaining for a moment any thought which has not been produced by them. From the publisher that also brings us the quasi-factual fantasies of Zechariah Sitchin and a (pseudonymous, one assumes) Joan d'Arc; possibly useful in busy households as a hedge against a shortage of toilet paper."
4,This is the Bible of physical conditioning,This book is a must have for anyone serious about improving their athletic performance. Filled with no-nonsense information for everything from strength training to aerobic conditioning to nutrition to biomechanics. This book is very technical and the information is very daunting. You must have a background in exercise science or sports medicine to fully comprehend everything. A big drawback to the book is the descriptions of exercise technique. The illustrations are sloppy and there are some outdated exercises featured that could be potentially dangerous to many athletes. This book is only five years old but the exercise science field changes fast and an updated version would probably make this book five stars.
1,Disappointed,"Not at all what you see in the picture. I could have picked these up at the local spoof store. the ants in the picture look big enough for children to pick up - these are nowhere near big enough. VERY disappointed. I was on a time crunch and had them shipped express. What a waiste of time and money! I had to give these ants one star, but they don't deserve it."
2,Plastic Picnic Ants-Package of 144,had a picnic party and used the ants for little gag decor.fit the theme. hard to find this type of item after halloween (needed in summer month)what you would expect them to be. the package seems small but 144 ants go a long way.price good.recommend for a joke or gag gift person!
5,ok,I did not realize how small these were when I ordered them. I found a different use for them then what actually bought them for.
3,Look at all of those ants!,I used these ants as part of a project for a garden lesson for preschools. They made their own ant hills and tunnels on paper and glued the ants in the tunnels. It was a hit!
2,picnic ants,the ants didn't look very real but I bought them for a picnic I was having for friends - just to make sure we had some ants!
3,Kubler-Ross Facing Death,"I was a little disappointed in this film, because it is a biography of Kubler-Ross and doesn't deal much with her groundbreaking theories. If you are interested in the woman, however, rather than the dying process, this is a GREAT film."
3,Let my people go,"For anyone that has an interest in South Africa or Apartheid, this book is great. Not many people know of Albert Luthuli but he played a major part in the uprising of the non-white people. Its a good book. Read it."
4,nice,Nice; the ones i got were a little lighter than the picture. But very clear and lots of fire.The only reason I rate them down slightly is that the diamond might not was well be there its so small.Decent price decent stones.
4,"Exactly what I needed; however, note of caution about orientation of rack","The world may be turning toward digital-only video, but mini-DV tapes still offer a measure of back-up not afforded by digital media.This storage rack is very sturdy, and perfect for keeping tapes organized.One word of warning: unless I'm mistaken, tapes should not be stored over the long term with their spools horizontal to the earth, as would be the case in the picture of the rack. Therefore, if hung on a wall or set on a shelf, the rack should have a ""portrait"" orientation. On the positive side, it's perfect for putting safely into a drawer."
3,10 Minutes/Scene is Too Long,"The scenes are beautiful but to stay for 10 minutes each is just too long. I don't see any artistic effort by the photographer. The camera is just placed in one position and that's it! For future productions, I would recommend some action to let the viewer see more surrounding, birds flying, anything other than looking at the same scene for 10 minutes. Kinda boring! sorry!"
5,A little bite of home,"This is the best cookbook for native New Yorkers who want to get a little taste of home. (We know you can't get a good bagel or pizza anywhere else -winkwink)... Plus, this was a used book in excellent condition and I got it for a song- the best $0.61 I've ever spent...."
1,Wonderful book for any former Brooklinite,"I loved this cookbook! It not only has the recipe for Lundy's famous Manhattan clam chowder, it also tells about Fox's U-bet Syrup, the Dodgers, Flatbush, the old Flatbush & Kings Highway cafeterias, Ba-Tempte pickles,Coney Island, Sheepshead Bay & much more....Detailed stories & recipies of all the neighborhoods from Williamsburg to Mill Basin....Many ethnicities & recipes for many of their foods: Irish, Italian, Polish, German, Jewish. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful! It covers the decades from the 1940s through the 1970s and would be esecially fun for folks who are baby boomers, like myself. Brought back many memories and I've tried many of the recipes -- they still work and are very good. Bravo!! A very good cookbook and a very interesting history of Brooklyn. Highly recommended Book."
5,Thousands of feet below you,"Her poem from this volume ""Thousands of feet below you"" is circulating on the net right now."
3,Most of Kneales work is wonderful,...but this isn't. The stories are solidly written but driven by a feeble theme relating to the injustice and and lack of understanding the first world has for the third. It may be OK for some poncey Oxford dinner parties but most of us want a little more insight and entertainment. The characters are mostly odious posh poms who the reader has a vested interest in seeing die from page one. It's almost as emetic as watching Bob 'pretentous wanker' Geldorf talking about Africa.
4,Produce has no seal,I just wish this product had a security seal on it. I'm a little nervous to use this without one.
1,"First ingredient makes me say ""no thanks""","Sodium Lauryl Sarcosinate doesn't seem safe once I looked into it. I really wanted to try it out too. I think Auromere is better, although it has laural sulfate and its last ingredient is anethol. Kiss my face was ok, it just has tree oil which I didn't like"
3,Record company is Sponging the Sponge!,I am here to tell you what I think of this .....(cd single...not!) Best of Sponge. First off they are only three albums out and only 2 albums are even used to make this. Somehow the record company dropped th sound quilty a tad. So the songs are not sounding quite as good. They is no comments abot the band and only a cover. The art is not very decent. I ca tell that Sony was cashing in on Sponge. Heres whats off of: Rotting Pinata 1. Molly (Sixteen Candles)5. Neenah Menasha6. Plowed8. Rotting Piñata9. PennywheelsHeres whats off of: Wax Ecstatic2. Wax Ecstatic (To Sell Angelina)3. Have You Seen Mary4. Got to Be a Bore7. I Am Anastasia10. VelveteenThis album lacks some songs off of Rotting Pinata which is sad to say the least. This album lacks anything off New Pop Sunday which I guess shouldn't surprise anyone. This Best-of to me seemed to be aimed at people who don't really dig Sponge and only want they few radio hits.
4,BeeGees into the 21st Century,"I'm surprised that I haven't come across the comparison sooner. Most people think of the BeeGees later years in disco and forget their early years ~ ""To Love Somebody,"" ""Words,"" ""How Can You Mend a Broken Heart."" The songs came from deep places in the heart with a sound that expressed those deepest emotions. Thanks to Blunt, we can now hear those heart-thoughts in the 21st century."
2,"Just one ""good"" song....","This album is centered around just the one song, ""You're Beautiful"". That song, while lyrically confusing, is musically good, and entertaining. To be sure, Blunt's unusual singing voice is at times a breath of fresh air compared to other ""singers"" who just shout...but it is also his downfall. The whole album is sappy. ""High"" is only an ""ok"" song and ""goodbye my lover"" just oozes with sap....and it's getting pretty thick. If you're into that sort of stuff, then this is a good album. But be prepared to not feel much happiness in this album. I don't know what did it....Blunt is a former British military officer, but his music style is too wussy. Key point: while you may have a ""beautiful"" singing voice, as some say, your song content doesn't have to be as effeminate. But the album altogether isn't horrible...and may be a welcome change of pace."
5,Awesome Lyrics,"If you have any taste in music, this is a great artist and a great CD. The song 'Goodbye My Lover' is hands down one of the most well written songs I've ever heard."
3,"Light weight, but good","I first heard James Blunt late 2004 from the talk of a music discussion board. The songs I heard were High and You're beautiful. The lyrics are not the most profound, the falsetto (not too many voices can do this well)takes some getting used to, but I loved the melodies. He caused quite a stir in th UK, but I did not think he would make it in the US music scene. No doubt the push from VH1 helped. His voice is more comfortable for me now...yeah he grew on me...so I will stick to 3 stars. I'm not that upset I purchased this."
4,caught my attention!,heard briefly and loved it. went looking for the cd and am still enjoying his very unusual voice and amazing lyrics.
5,Love it!,"james blunt has great lyrics, most of them end up feeling kind of sad but i wouldn't say in any way that its depressing. Its what you listen to when you are feeling thoughtful and introspective."
3,Good Old James,James Blunt reminds me of someone who has lived a long time. He sings with such heart and soul and his songs really make you think about the words and their meanings. This is one of my favorite albums and I listen to it almost daily. I truly think you will like it as much I do especially if you are a child of the sixties or seventies.
4,"Good, but could do with writing some new songs.","I think the songs on this album are, although they are good, are to widely played and played to much, such as 'your beautiful', which i hear everywhere i go.Apart from that this was a beautiful record with so much charecter. You could really feel him singing the song, and i got right in there.If you want my advice, defiantly buy this record.Sam Worrallrating:4 stars!"
3,"Not fully convinced, but nice to listen to.","James is a man with a great talent and a good future in the music industry. However i do think he lacks the guitar and singing ability to convince true music fans. I do sometimes wonder ""why listen to Blunty boy when you have got Jose Gonzales"". James has great commercial appeal but i do think his record sales will suffer from ""bluntlash"" because when he realeased your beutiful hundreds of thousands of people went straight to the shops and bought the album, so people have already heard his songs so he cant release anymore. I like it but im still doubtful."
1,"In the tradition of Yanni, Kenny G, & Michael Boulton!","If it were scientifically possible to cross-breed Rod Stewart with a Central American 3-toed sloth who makes mating calls out of its armpits while in heat, it would sound like Mr. Blunt.If you own a restaurant and had to chose between playing James Blunt or a repeating sound loop of fingernails being scraped across a chalkboard, go with the fingernails. Your Janitorial cost savings would be ten fold thanks to the smaller amount of people who need to rush to the bathroom and vomit while listening to ""You're Beautiful"". . . ."
2,plastic music for girls,"Processed-sounding and contrived. Teenage girls will love the soul-searching lyrics that actually aren't soul-searching at all. It might be interesting to get Mr Blunt out of the recording studio, take away the studio musicians, and see what happens. There's some talent perhaps under the perfect-sounding sheen somewhere. Buy The Velvet Underground instead."
2,Not the best we can do,To all overseas readersThis really isn't the best the UK can do. Not quite sure what all the hype is about.
1,hey blunt take the plum out of your throat,james blunt the worst singer i've ever heard his plummy back of the throat singing really makes me want to rip his vocal chords out god he so annoying i really can't understand why women love him maybe because of his cheesy sweet lyrics your beautiful pass the bucket mateand his new single is so corny it's laughableso he was in the army where's the politcal lyrics abouthow recruits get beaten by the officers like we've all seen in the newspapers helloit's all nice and sweet to talk about love but god there's better subjects than thati'd rather listen to kate bush's new albums and david gray's new classic or daniel powterthree great singer/songwriter who can actually sing
1,Smarmy over-rated and over-played,"I purchased 'Back to Bedlam' after reading that James Blunt was being hailed as the male Tori Amos. Being a Toriphile I was intrigued and very excited to hear this album. What a disappointment! I tried. I listenned to this album at least 10 times and just cant stand it. Sure its up close and personal but its uninspired and lackluster. Its like listening to bad, adolescent poetry set to elevator music! ""You're beautiful"" makes me want to hit myself in the head with a hammer til I'm dead. No wonder Weird Al Yankovic did a parody called ""You're pitiful"",(available for download on his website). 'Beautiful' could very easily have come directly from a love-note passed in middle school algebra class. Lets hope Mr. Blunt stays off the subway and to all the women in the world, PLEASE AVOID DIRECT EYE CONTACT WITH JAMES BLUNT! I gave the CD to my secretary because she expressed an interest. She hates it too!"
1,Tautology at its best,"My Goodness, the entire CD sounds the same. Whiny and weak. The best song on the entire album is ""You're Beautiful"" and it sucks! The whole listening experience makes you want to drink liquid plumber. I know many people are into Mr. Blunt, but not I said the cat."
3,A tribute to Jim Morrison?,"No, it definetely doesn't sound like The Doors! James Blunt's ""Back to Bedlam"" reminds me more of Daniel Powter, Keane or even Coldplay... melancholy in the lyrics and in the sound of almost every single track...I just wanted to point out to Ingeborg from Norway, who has written a very useful review explaining all tracks one by one, that in my opinion track 7 ""So long Jimmy"" is entirely dedicated to Jim Morrison and not to a friend of James Blunt who has passed away... The lyrics tell so much about someone who made great songs and who didn't live long, and in the end of the song we can hear a bit of ""Riders on the storm"" sounds... absolutely great!What makes me think too that James' face on the cover looks so very much like Jimmy Morrison's! The first time I saw this album in a shop I thought it was an album of The Doors!A tribute to Jim Morrison?"
3,Back to Bedlam,"This is marvelous, for a teenager, for 40 somethings, to absolutely any age. Very easy to listen too. I can't get enough of this CD. I have told EVERYONE about James Blunt. Trust me I don't normally get excited over music."
1,Deserves zero stars - shouldn't even have a record deal,"James Blunt song ""Beautiful"" is the worst song I think I have ever heard in my life. It is worse than ""Fish-heads"" (at least that song was amusing). He has no talent. Simple songwriting has produced some of the best pop/rock songs ever, but simple and low quality just equals bad. I actually find this CD insulting. Record companies wonder why no one buys CD's anymore, it is because of ""singer-songwriters"" like James Blunt.""You're beautiful. You're beautiful.You're beautiful, it's true.There must be an angel with a smile on her face,When she thought up that I should be with you.But it's time to face the truth,I will never be with you.""I bet there are over a million 13 year old girls in this country who could write better lyrics than that..."
2,back to bedlam,"Other then ""You're Beautiful"" and ""Wisemen"", this is a pretty crappy cd! James' voice sounds the same in every song. When I first heard those two songs I thought WOW, this guy's cd must sound fantastic. I was wrong, really wrong. I have to agree though that some songs are somewhat catchy, but it's nothing special. ""Voice of an angel"" my butt, his voice gets annoying after awhile. He sounds like he's getting over a cold or something. Not recommended, unless you're a fan of You're Beautiful and Wisemen, or better yet, download the songs."
1,just gotta say,"James Blunt makes me cringe. His ""sincerity"" feels so so calculated, even if it isn't. I feel like he is the sensitive musician you see in a bad comedy, (I just saw JUST FRIENDS) if you know what I mean. Also to compare him to Elliott Smith is absurd, wrong, and insulting to Mr. Smith. It also seems to me that Blunt is the Huge Corporation attempt to attract fans of good un-mainstream music. I truly would not be surprised if Alanis Morissette fans dug this. And Morissette fans frankly don't have any taste. Also, I noticed that this review has been looked at by the most people... Blunt is apparantly what people are checking out, and that's sad, when there is so much more out there."
1,"Simply ""Beautiful"" lol","OMG .... this cd is sooooo beautiful..... I LOVE LOVE LOVE that song ""Your Beautiful"" because it's like so emotional and (no pun intended!) beautiful. It makes me cry like every time I listen to it. I would totally buy this cd just for that song b/c it is so meaningful...For example: ""You're beautiful, You're beautiful... You're Beautiful""OMG OMG so awsome.... like you can totally see the girl he's talking about and he's so in love. omg. this song is just so amazing. OMGM GOMOGOMGMOMOG"
1,The male Celine Dion,"Hey folks. If you like Celine Dion and emotionally vacuous power ballads that profusely effuse about love but in actuality have nothing to say about real emotion, then this record will tickle you in places that you didn't know could be tickled. However, I am not one of these people, and as such I would not buy this album or recommend it to anybody with a modicum of emotional intelligence. Do yourself a favour and stay away from this album at all costs, and perhaps buy a Kelly Clarkson record -- she does the same thing but with a less annoyingly cloying falsetto. Thanks for your time."
4,Good album - a bit Beatles-y,OK we've all heard James Blunt's song You're Beautiful on either the radio or the TV but the album is more than that. For a start you have to really listen to the words and I just love his voice. The album has some adult language but I don't think that detracts from the songs which I have been playing over and over since I bought the album.I'm not a big fan of the Beatles but I think James has been influenced by them at some point. Move over Robbie Williams you've got competition!
3,Love him or hate him....,"This CD is fantastic. One of the best to come around in years! I have a 300+ collection, and since buying this CD, I reach for it most. Every single song is either thought provoking, sad, witty, all these different, strange emotions at once. His show at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia was unforgettable. Don't be put off by the negative reviews. If you want to listen to something unique and beautiful, buy this CD. You will not regret it!"
5,Soundtrack of my (current) life...,"the song 'beautiful' is what got me to listen to the rest of this album. the first two times through, it was still growing on me, but i continued to listen to it. the third time through, i knew i was in love. yesterday i listened to it eight times! james has an amazing ability to make you feel emotionally attached to his music. this one's gonna be at the top of my list for a long time."
5,WOW!!!,"This is the best CD...I can listen to it over and over again and do...""Good By My Lover""...gives me goose bumps...his voice has an interesting warbly quality about...I like each and every song on it...and definitely will look for more CD's by him."
5,Beautiful,"I initialy saw this on my son's wish list, and realized ""You're so beautifu"" was on the CD, and also bought it for myself. The lyrics are thoughtful and at times intense. My only negative is that when listened to from beginning to end, there is a sameness to the music. I still highly recommend the CD."
4,Very nice,"A nice easy to listen to CD. James Blunt has a sexy, calming voice. I love this CD so much, I play it all the time and sing along. The Hip Hop crowd is not going to like this at all, but if you like Elliott Smith, James Taylor or Damien Rice, you will like this."
2,David Gray on helium,"I dunno, man... I was open to this, I really was, but I just can't quite ""go there""...A little too corny (the reviewer below is right), a little too heart-on-sleeve sincere. Something, too, about the timbre of his voice - it's just not pleasing. Pts. for trying."
2,Mediocre Mainstream Pop!,"I heard James Blunt's ""Back To Bedlam"" playing in a local music store at the local mall and to me it's just mediocre pop and nothing else. This guy sounds like he's been listening to The Bee Gee's since he was ten years old. Atleast The Bee Gee's had talent, something this guy doesn't have! I hate ""You're Beautiful"" it's so mainstream pop and syrupy it's sickening. As a matter of fact the whole cd is just that! ""Cry"" and ""Billy"" are about as weak as you can get, both crappy acoustic guitar tunes. Let me tell you James Blunt would have never have made it in the seventies. Artists like Cat Stevens, Paul Simon, Gordon Lightfoot, Jim Croce, and James Taylor could run rings around Mr. Blunt. It's too bad, but our music industry is hopeless!"
2,"Good singer, weird marketing strategy.","If Blunt's music is so great and if he is a military war veteran.... why does he have to grow his hair into a Beatles mop and in his video take his smelly shoes off in a ceremonial zen-like fashion? What's is all that about? We can also do without all the potty-mouth language. It's overdone and it's impact is long gone today.He has a good voice and his songs are fine.... now James, clean up your language, stop pretending to be a member of Paul Revere and the Raiders, and know it's okay to be well groomed and looking sharp... and you will get 2 more stars from this reviewer."
1,worst album...EVER,"This album is a cynical exercise - nothing more. Do not allow yourself to be sucked in by such sentimental tripe. This album is Boring, repetitive, banal, just plain BAD. There is no muscianship or songcraft. Honestly, James Blunt is the worst ""artist"" I have ever heard and he should NEVER have been allowed a recording contract.It's fifteen minutes and counting for him..."
1,Back To Bedlam,"Purchased as a gift for my Mom, who hear the song ""You're Beautiful"" on the radio. I didn't realize that the CD has ""adult lyrics"" - profanity and not the radio version of the song. There is no reason to have to swear in a love song. I was very embarrassed when she informed me of this."
4,better than expected,I bought the CD for basically one song. I was surprised when I liked the whole record. Not to mention this guy is a real cutie.
2,no need for explicit language,I don't quite see the appeal of the trend for explicit language in music. I think it would be much better to just leave it out. Whether you sing it or speak it its just plain offensive.
2,Keep the Profanity out of Ballads!,"I absolutley loved ""you're beautiful"" when i heard it on the radio. BUT i got the album and the song was RUINED with the ""F-ing high"" line!!! Its totally out of place. Now i wished i had bought the censored version! Who would of known he'd put an ""F"" word in such a sweet gentle song;("
5,I like it!,Its a nice mellow cd. All the songs are catchy. It is a well rounded first cd. Nice bathtub music!
3,Ten stars for the first three songs,"Here's the breakdown:10/10 - High (he really can and knows how to hit those high notes, unlike Josh Kelley)10/10 - You're Beautiful (Wow is all I can say. I hear a little bit of Rod Stewart in his voice)10/10 - Wiseman (I'm starting to think that this guy does not do a bad song, but I'll keep listening just in case)7/10 - Goodbye My Lover (If this song was 3 minutes instead of 4, it would have been 10/10)4/10 - Tears and Rain (Now I'm starting to think the first three songs were a fluke)2/10 - Out of My Mind (Now his voice is starting to get annoying)9.8/10 - So Long Jimmy (Okay, so it wasn't a fluke!!)4/10 - Billy (How many songs do we need about Billy!)2/10 - Cry (zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz)1/10 - No Bravery (It was a fluke!)Check out Daniel Powter. He's from Canada, but doesn't do a bad song."
2,Pseudo-serious pop,"The production is lush. Mr. Blunt has that kind of raspy tenor that sounds sincere and inoffensive at the same time. It's elevator music, the kind of music some people put on to chill. Kem, Norah Jones and a long list of others make this kind of candy. It sells because it fills a need. But is stuff like this memorable or profound? No. Look at the lyrics of this CD. It reads like bad high school poetry. Are the melodies particularly interesting? It's the kind of stuff someone with very modest musical talent can thump away on a piano or guitar.Why the hype for this CD? I have no idea. It's a pleasant enough listen and is well produced. It's decent enough music to smooch to. I can point to tens of CDs made this year that are of this ilk that haven't been selling nearly as well. Someone has to be anointed by the press, and this is James Blunt's turn. Lucky guy. He's won the lottery with rather ordinary music."
3,Be careful...,Be careful; there are two versions of this CD. Originally I purchased the one with explicit lyrics and regretted it. Later I purchased the one without the foul language and enjoyed it much more.
1,No Warning,"I was unaware that James Blunt's Back to Bedlam CD came in two versions-- clean and filled with foul language. When I ordered the used version, I saw no warning that there would be expletives in songs I had heard without profanity. This should have been put right in the description -- I am unhappy about the CD, and upset that such beautiful songs are ruined with inappropriate language."
5,Great New Find,"Heard this album in London a few months ago, just as it was taking Britain by storm. Nice mix of ballads and catchy tunes that listeners can relate to. Blunt's lyrics often seem like poems put to music rather than just songs. Especially moving is ""No Bravery,"" about a soldier's experience in war. ""Goodbye my Lover"" will hit home for listeners nursing broken hearts. And probably everyone can relate to the episode described in the chart-topping ""You're Beautiful."" Best of all - you can actually understand the lyrics when they are sung!"
5,Blown Away.,"Usually I buy good old fashioned 'Rock'. (In fact the day I bought this album I also bought QOTSA, Foo's and Aerosmith.) But of the four this is the one that is the most compelling. Beautiful, soulful and refreshingly honest lyrics combined with great hooks really draw the listener in. It makes you want to listen to the words rather than just hear the album as background music. Not bad for an ex squaddy!!"
5,Outstanding!,"What a fantastic album. For me, the standout track is ""Goodbye my Lover"". It brings a tear to my eye with the sheer emotion of his voice and his lyrics.Of course, ""You're Beautiful"" is just that, a beautiful song. I have to admire the intensity he brings to every song and I highly, highly recommend this album to everyone. He is just outstanding!"
1,I could barely get through the first listen....,"so I gave it another chance. I still didn't like it. I consider myself somewhat of a singer/songwriter aficionado, and I gotta tell ya, this guy won't last. Whiney voice, mediocre songwriting at best and just plain boring. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. For some real talent, check out Nick Drake, Elliott Smith, Damien Rice, etc."
3,Back to the Drawing Board,"With a dial set well away from AM, middle-of-the-road frequencies, it was by chance that Blunt appeared on our radar. There he sat at the piano, one evening presenting the mood music for Michael Parkinson's chats with celebrities.Appearance on such a format should have served as an indicator of Blunt's talents. Still, his waif-like intensity was winning as he soared through the lament,'Goodbye My lover'. The promise of this pop-ballad does not extend to the remainder of the disc. His voice and sensibility, pitched near early 70s Barry Gibb and Elton John, is likely to net a similar audience. It's just that there is a wearying sameness to the songs, the vocal idiosyncracities and arrangments, that collectively dimish the compelling,'Goodbye'. The adolescent corniness of the lyrics suggests that, were I to pursue Blunt further, he'd need to solicit other writers or deepen the game with his muse. Given the mega success of this outing, neither course is likely."
4,James Blunt-Back to Bedlam,"Great Album. A few favourite songs were ""So Long Jimmy"" A soulful tribute to Jimi Hendrix---( a guess) Very clever weaving of Jimi's song/album titles into the lyrics, and ""Goodbye"" A great break-up/funerary/moving on tune."
5,Excellent!,I heard one of his songs on the radio - bought the Cd on the strength of that one and was really impressed. It's true what one of the other reviewers said - it is the sort of album you can put on and listen to the entire CD without being disappointed. Buy it!
2,blah,"I didn't purchase this album but I borrowed it from my dad out of curiosity. I must say that James Blunt is one of those types of artists that seems to have it all....(ie cool voice, emotional lyrics etc) however his ability to write a catchy song (save You're Beautiful) is simply void. Someone in this list of reviewers compared him to Elton John. LOL....That's a good one. This disk isn't horrible. But it's not particularly inspiring either. Nothing on the disk motivates me to listen a 2nd or 3rd time.By the way, we were unfortunate enough to get the CD with the f-word explicative in the song, You're Beautiful, which blared out with our 3 kids listening in the car. Thanks alot, James."
4,wow!!,"james blunt has the most melancholic voice i have ever heard of...when i first listen to the single,you're beautiful,his voice really caught my attention....he sounded so sad and yet victorious in a way....other noteworthy songs worth listening in this album are wiseman,tears and rain and high..."
4,Good Music,"I'm always keen to the UK music scene. I had to check out why the Brits have had this album on the top of their charts going on two months now. I had watched the video online of ""You're Beautiful"". He's got a great voice and is a good songwriter. The Brits got it right again. Love it!"
3,"I like James, But didn't care for this Album",I saw him on T.V. But the songs sound nothing like what you can get on the MP3. I like 1973 so when I bought Back to Bedlam the lady should have warn me about the language in the C.D.
2,"Okay Songs, Irritating Voice, Horrible Grooming","The songs are no better or worse than rock songs written over the past 10 years or so. Nothing new or innovative there. ""Beautiful"" sounds a lot like ""You Are So Beautiful"" by Joe Cocker... which was also a huge hit 25 years ago, but who NO one listens to today.The voice? As good as most garage or grunge band lead singers. Scratchy, irritating to a mature ear, raspy, though he occasionally slips into a falsetto, so some may find that novel and ""cool"".... it's basically a gimmick and better suited to a female voice.The grooming and image? Hey James, the ""bed-head"" look went out about 3 years ago, sleepy head.... and no, you don't look like Jim Morrison."
1,Vulgar,"It would be nice if what we hear on the radio matched what we thought we were buying. I pitched the cd because I can't play ""You're Beautiful"" in front of my kids. Thanks for nothing; now you know why people download it for FREE! You punish the very people who PAID for your music."
3,Not Enough Illustrations,"This book does give a short sketch of each saint.However, there are only black line drawings. Amazonoffers lots of other material about saints that arebetter. The age group for this item is about 10-14 years."
1,"great illustrations, terrible text.",While there is no doubt that much of Eastern thought can be paralleled in such a classic tale. Green destroys the magic (obviously he never read the novel or any of the other Oz books) while he applies smarmy psychology. Aunt Em and Uncle Henry disfunctional! Dorothy suffering from guilt over her parent's death. Give us a break! He also fails to credit any of the other writers who have worked in this area. The illustrations are charming and suckered me in.
4,Helpful but a hassle,"This maternity support belt fits great and helps support my ever growing belly, i got it when i was around 23wks, i wish i had gotten it sooner. The main complaint i have with it is that you have to take it off and on every time you use the restroom, and being a nurse in a busy ER this creates a huge hassle for me."
4,really helped from 20wk+,"I bought and used this maternity support on recommendation from a friend. I loved it. It was so helpful, especially when I was exercising (with weights & while doing jacks, etc) and out for a walk/run. When I went without it, I would be in pain the next day, and felt like I was walking around like a old woman. With it, I wouldn't have any pain the next day. It was wonderful!It does bunch up in the back some. I did like how the back was designed so that when it bunched to fit my curves it didn't make it uncomfortable or unsightly."
4,Good support but not comfy sitting,It is very helpful when you are on your feet or walking. It is not comfortable when seated & increases my acid reflux. But I love it for shopping & walking.
4,exactly what I needed,"I got this when 7 months pregnant. I tried this one on in a maternity store prior to purchasing on Amazon so I knew which size to get. It seems to be true to size they recommend. The velcro never comes off on its own. It rarely catches other clothes, and even then has not been damaging. You can't really see it through clothing, unless I wear a very tight-fitting shirt. I was even surprised that I don't have to adjust it when I go between sitting and standing. My only complaint is the strap that holds the first piece in front of the abdomen extends beyond where the velcro for the back part would go, which makes it harder for the back velcro to stick. I've found that if I put that front strap looser I don't have that problem but it's a bit more cumbersome putting the back on. My favorite part is how tall the back support is - sometimes my back pain is high and it feels really good to have support there."
2,Not for Me,"The belt wasn't too uncomfortable, but it definitely didn't help me. Every time I had it on I think our little baby girl wasn't comfortable and kept moving, which made me even more uncomfortable. It got me wondering if it would change her from a good head down position to another."
3,OK for the money,"I am in my seventh month and have varicosities and ligament pain and a belt was recommended by my doctor for both. While I don't feel it helped much with the varicosities, it did help relieve some of the ligament pain. It is good for when I am up and around walking, but not very comfortable while sitting down. The front section is not wide enough for where the velcro from the back support hooks on so the overlap has started to bend and show more under my clothes. Overall, I am glad for the support it does give, but I would shop around for a different brand next time."
3,Effective but complicated,"When I got this product, I followed the instructions/picture on the box in order to put it on since there are 3 different pieces that all velcro together. It is effective and supportive, specially when I'm chasing my 18 month old around the house or bending down to pick up toys (I'm currently 8 months pregnant with, what i've been told, a 'big baby'). However, when I sit down, the back pannel rolls up so I have to adjust it everytime I get up. And since I have to use the restroom 15 times a day, it becomes cumbersome to put it on and take it off all 15 times. Other than, good product."
2,Not what I expected,"This is three different pieces that all velcro together, it isn't quick or easy to put on. It did however help prevent back pain while I was packing and unpacking my home during a move at 7 months pregnant."
4,Nice-looking t-shirt!,This is a very nice-looking t-shirt. I think the shirt itself runs a little small but the graphics are outstanding. My son loves the shirt and can't wait to show his navy buddies his new t-shirt!
4,Bings croons some jazz while Bix blows some hot riffs...,"Bing Crosby is probably the most underrated jazz singer(with the acception of Doris Day) who really was singing jazz while stiff singers like Irving Kaufman and John McCormick were as stiff as a rod. Crosby(who was highly influenced by Louis Armstrong's singing at the time) and Bix(who was also influenced by Armstrong's playing, but never imitated him) are featured here of course with Paul Whiteman's somewhat dated band, while Whiteman's outfit was playing dated uhm-pa-pa's Bing and Bix we're jazzing it up, which Whiteman didn't like at all, however Bing & Bix did add a lot of jazz content to Whiteman's outfit. This CD is mainly recomended to fans of Bix and Bing."
2,Bix Is Missing,"These are interesting early Bing recordings, but Bix is virtually nowhere to be heard except lost in the horn section of the Paul Whiteman band. A flagrantly misleadingly named album."
3,Doesn't stop a determined raccoon.,"Bought one of these units to protect a 30 x 50 foot garden from raccoon depredation. I mounted five wires on steel T-posts using the appropriate insulators, and used four ground rods, each 6 feet long. The unit supplies adequate electricity to the wires for most animals, but I found that a determined raccoon learned to charge the fence, jump between wires (they are 6-8 inches apart) and devour my cantaloupes (got photos on a trail camera). Apparently by moving quickly enough through the wires he did not receive much of a shock. To stop him, I added standard chicken wire (2 feet tall, anchored to the ground) behind the electric wire. The chicken wire and electric wire together seems to work, as he hasn't been back. The 3 or 5 inch insulators work best for this kind of setup because they keep the electric wire far enough away from the chicken wire to prevent it from grounding the electric wire out."
3,Needs a larger battery,"This is a okay solar fence charger, with the exception for the dinky little 6 volt battery. I've been using it installed on about 800 ft of single strand charger wire. When it cloudy for two days, it usually takes a full day of recharging before it regains optimal operation. Changing to a larger 6 volt gel cell 4 ah cured this problem but had to add addition separate enclosure to house the larger batttery."
5,Solar Electric Fence,"So far so good, our mini molly mule and pony haven't broke thru the vinyl fence yet. When they do approach it the shock is good enough to keep them at bay."
4,Great for Small Office,"It connected easily to our ITT EKS-616 system. It's been working great for over a year; we just bought another one. When I got it, the ear pieces were pinching horribly. Even tho I bought it thru either Amazon or Ebay (can't remember), Plantronics was quick to send out their newly designed ones. They also helped me get the settings tuned for the best quality. We're very pleased with the performance - small office, not constant use - mainly for long calls or eternal hold situations. I wear mine with the over-the-head connector and if I am using it for long periods on an active day, I get a sore ear from frequent pushing of the connect button. The new one, tho, seems to have come with a cushion, so maybe it is not causing that kind of soreness. Spring for the HL-10 lifter - it's worth it."
2,Cheap parts,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002CWPS6/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgI bought this tectonics CS 50 last year the first one I got was broke, this one works fine but, the Silver switch broke it's made of cheap plastic otherwise this unit works fine have no problem talking on it to the Bluetooth unit the only problem with it is my Mac does not recognize it to listen to read with us tried several times to get it to work but to no avail if I was Amazon I would look in to this unit. I am writing this review by talking it to my Mac computer. Walter"
1,return policy,you are losing me as a customer.i purchased this item-it would not charge.I was sent a replacement-it would not charge.I returned both items as requested and spent $11.48 for return shipping.i was reimbursed $2.52WHY SHOULD I BE OUT $8.96 FOR SENDING BACK TWO PRODUCTS THAT DID NOT WORK.
4,I Love Florence,"This is at least 2 different discs. I would imagine the feelings invoked are different for those who have never been to Florence. This will provide some of the ambience. It is not a teaching disc, but more of an experience. You do not have to study it, just sit back and enjoy. For those who have visited Florence it is an nice stroll through the lovely city. Maybe it would even spur one to go back."
3,Rusts easily,"This mail box fits perfectly on my front porch post. However, it began to rust almost immediately. We live on the salt water, but I would expect it to resist rust better."
2,Picture is Deceptive DO NOT BUY,When I first saw this I thought that it was four trucks. The price seemed right for four trucks. I had purchased a similar truck at Kohls for a fourth of the price so it only seemed right. When I got the package there was one truck and my boys are not loving it at all.
5,Excellent guitar and affordable,"I have been playing guitar for 22 years, but am not a ""gear junkie"" as I have been playing the same electric since '90. I have always wanted a Les Paul (played them many times in Guitar Center) but have been unwilling to part with a few thousand dollars. A friend turned me onto Rondomusic after he purchased a Strat knockoff for under $100. I played it and was quite surprised by the feel and sound of the guitar. So, I took a chance and purchased the AL-3000 2TS Flame Top for $400 plus shipping. I could not have been happier. It feels great, plays great, and sounds great. Yes, it isn't a Les Paul; but for $400 you cannot beat it."
1,Sucked!!!,"From my daughter-in-law (who loves horror movies) - If I could, I would give this movie -10. This movie was terrible... The beginning is slow, then it acts like it might turn around and be good but it drags out to a disappointing ending and leaves you hanging with an unsolved problem. The Calvary have their heads up their asses the entire time and don't care to stop and listen to what others are saying or take advice from the Indians who have been living with the ""mystery"" murderers and know exactly what the hell is going on and how to kill the ""monsters"". Anyways please don't wast your time I wish I would have used this time to catch up on sleep but instead I wasted my time here."
1,The Burrowers,"This movie was terrible; it starts out very slow and goes on and on. From start to finish it had nothing to offer, the monsters at the very last 5 minutes were done right, to bad you had to wait to the end to see them. Save your money this one is from 1 to 10 a 0."
3,Interesting story and plot.,I enjoyed the film but I have to say that I will not be watching it a second time. Okay movie for a late night sleep over.
3,Could have been better.,"Heavy on gore, no real plot developement, just monsters eating everyone. Nothing new here, however the cinematography was excellent, it just seemed like it was missing something to me."
4,The Burrowers,"this movie kept me on the edge of my seat wondering who or what it was that was coming for these people, until, oh! my goodness, this movie was very creepy to say the least."
4,Fun Western Horror Flick,"I found this movie to be very well done. Being a horror/thriller/mystery aficionado there are certain things I look for in a movie, especially a horror or thriller movie. First is story line, I found the story to be quite believable and very well acted with multiple layers to the main story arc. We have the western setting complete with pioneer settlers, Indian conflict and the military. The writers and director managed to create dimension with the characters through using fairly accurate historical elements. Secondly, Production Value is key to a good movie experience. The cinematography was excellent, as well as the sets, costumes and special effects. This is no low budget, grind house student film. It leaves you thinking - who are the real monsters in this movie? Is it the burrowers or the humans?"
4,Burrowers review,"Thought this movie was well acted and had an excellent kick-ass plot. I am gonna watch this movie again and again, its one of those movies that gets better each time you watch it. Bet it'll be a classic before too long."
1,BORING! BORING! BORING!,"This is the most boring ""horror"" movie ever. OMG, can a movie be more tedious? Just soooooo boring, w/ scene after scene of more tedious so-called buildup. And, the cinephotography is so dark, that you'll think something is wrong with your TV. I never used to like westerns on tv when I was young; it took forever for anything to happen. This movie is the same way-slow, slow, slow, and nothing happens. PLEASE don't waste your time. It's horrible. Just a total waste of time."
3,Interesting Idea...,"This one has one thing going for it and that's its setting. The horror western is a virtually unsuccessful genre with few entries of note save ""Curse of the Undead"" and ""Ravenous"". The creatures are fascinating but highly derivative of the alien in ""Xtro"", sort of like Linda Blair's backwalk down the stairs in ""The Exorcist"" or the quickly glimpsed creature from ""In The Mouth of Madness"". They aren't shown in detail enough and when they are the facial features look a bit crude and unfinished. Worth a look for creature feature fans but some of the acting and characters had all the appeal of a TV miniseries. Always good to see Clancy Brown though... even as a a good guy."
3,Clancy Brown is in it !,"Clancy Brown is in it and thats good, the countryside and horses are beautiful and well filmed, thats good. But other than that it pretty well failed."
3,Good Fun,"Well worth a viewing. A perfectly entertaining little film. A simple idea with ,frankly, fairly poor special effects but the overall product was fun. Well acted, well paced and just smart enough. I'm generally disappointed by purchases like this, but I'm glad I gave this one a shot."
3,Tremors with a great twist,"If you remember the movie ""Tremors"" staring Kevin Bacon, you will like this movie. It is a rather another version of underground ""creatures"" but are much more gruesome than those in the other movie. Set in the froniter day, just like a certain sequal, this movie seperates itself in a couple of aspects, first because the native americans know of these creatues and have even already given them a name and secondly the creatures are way more out of this world. The design concept of the creatures is outstanding and the way the director intermingles them with the actors is done magnificently. The acting is above average, the down side is that the movie becomes pretty predicatble and the ending is somewhat the same as most of these types of movies. It does have plenty of moments of brilliance and is worth watching, however, if you are looking at this as a true horror movie, then you will be disappointed, it is more of a thirller movie."
2,burrows,"Not enough depth in the movie...a little week, I was expecting a good western, what ever happened to just good o'l westerns!"
4,Put this on your watch list!,I found this movie was pretty tense not knowing what was going to happen.I would definitely recommend this! If you like westerns and subterranean creaturesand Indians then you will have no problem with this.
3,Nice surprise,"This is a fun movie, it is not a waste of time. Get your pop corn, cola and what ever else you need and get entertained and if your not check your pulse."
4,A pretty good movie,I really enjoyed this one. It kept me interested throughout and.... WOW it was a really good movie. Acting was great. Well written and loved the monsters! A must see!
1,Complete ripoff!,This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The whole movie is spent out in the fields where a bunch of cowboys play cheap 'horror' tricks on the viewer! Unknown mish-mash of actors and not much money spent on production either. What's left to watch? What could they produce other than sucking your money and wasting your time? Skip this one.
5,The OED of beekeeping!,"For the seasoned or beginning beekeeper, this tome has everything you might want to know. More than complete, surprisingly easy to navigate, HIVE AND THE HONEY BEE is the bee all and end all."
5,A great gift!,I would recommend this to anyone who needs an easy way to remove makeup that doesn't require soap and water.
1,"new photos, or same as in the ""twins"" book?","It would be very helpful to know whether the photographs depicted on these cards are the same as -- or different from -- photographs appearing in Underhill's ""Twins"" book. Do the cards in fact duplicate photos already in the book, or are they new-and-unique shots of the twins? Would someone who has purchased both the book and the cards let the rest of us know? Thanks."
2,Packers were not paying attention,"Whoever packed this product did not get the pieces right. We did not receive enough pieces to make the number of frames promised. We did receive something that had NOTHING to do with our product, and we're unsure if it was trash or should have gone out to someone else. Pathetic."
2,Not helpful,"I used this book as a help while studying for a pharmacokinetics course in pharmacy school. I found it to be of little use for this purpose.Reading one chapter to learn a concept was not helpful as there was little focus on important details, just a lot of little picky information that really wasn't necessary. And looking up one particular piece of information was even difficult as vague examples and rambling sentences made reading the entire chapter a must.As a review tool, the problems at the ends of the chapters were not helpful, either. The problems went from too easy to fantastically difficult with no in between.As a student this wasn't a helpful reference or study tool."
5,Wow! I Found It!,"This was my first response when I saw Phil's album on Amazon.com. I first heard him on Daystar Television and was so inspired by not only the enchanting Godly sounds that came from the group's instruments, but the inspiring words that Phil spoke. This is truely a piece that you want to share with everyone you know. I am proud to share this CD by purchasing it for my friends to hear them say, ""where did you find this guy, The CD is awesome?"" Trust me, you will not regret owning ""The Quiet"", it is truely a masterpiece. C. Moore, Petersburg, VA."
1,Too bulky for use in a carseat,"This is too thick and bulky to work well for my child riding in a forward-facing carseat. She likes it b/c it's cute and wants to wear it, but it forces her head forward and when she falls asleep her head is just hanging down uncomfortably."
3,Different from image,"Just purchased this for my grandson. It is very soft and I think he will enjoy it. IT does NOT look at all like the presented image. IT is solid yellow, spots and ears are same solid yellow. Grandson kept saying WHAT is it? I also purchased a different brand pillow in shape of Monkey which he recognized immediately."
5,Perfect!,"Been looking for one of these for a while! Glad I waited to get this one. My 16 month old son loves it and after one use, began putting it on himself when we'd go for a ride in the car. Soft and cuddly and the size is not too small at all. I'm thinking of getting one for myself too."
3,Get out of shape easily.,It got out of sahpe easily after my 3 year old used it several times. Too bad cause the idea is good and it did stop his head from bending forward the first couple times when he fell asleep in the car.
2,Save your money,"This does not work. It's not too thick and not long enough to be functional even for a small baby. It actually makes my daughter less comfortable when sleeping in the car. At best, it can be used by craming it in the space between your child's head and the car seat as a ""prop"" but it certainly does not work well in it's normal capacity.Would not recommend or buy again."
2,Noodlehead Travel Buddies Neck Pillow,"Didn’t know when I bought it that it was for a toddler. I might have been shopping too quickly but think I would have noticed. It was very flimsy for support, but again, it was meant for an adult who likes horses. Oh well."
2,Not comfy,"We used it once! The head of the animal makes it very difficult to position the baby head. Also, the material made him to sweat."
3,Too bulky for a 2 year-old,"This pillow is very cute and my daughter loves holding it while in the car. It is actually too big for her tiny little neck (she is 33 inch tall and only 22 lbs), so it doesn't really serve the purpose of supporting her head. It will probably work a lot better in couple of years!"
2,Black bear,Feels soft and comfy but doesn't do it's main function which is to support the head. Am disappointed with the product
4,Noodlehead allegator neck pillow,Got it for my 3 year old. He loves it as it is cute and does the job. Quality is good.
4,Nice comfortable neck pillow,"I bought this neck pillow for my son, because we have a long plane ride before us. He used it on a ten-hour car trip recently and he loved it very much. Very soft and comfortable- and added bonus: they can play with it!It was great that this pillow is machine washable; however, one part of the stitching came apart, even though I washed it on cold and gentle cycle.Overall, very nice pillow"
3,Would have been good but tore easily,I have to agree with a review that the fabric is much too thin. I recently bought this for my daughter since we will be doing some flying in the coming months. We have not even left and the green fabric is already torn and balding in some spots. I really wanted this to work too!
2,Too soft,I needed some neck support when my 18th month old son falls asleep in his car seat so I purchased this item only to find that it is too soft to provide the much needed support. His head still slumps ackwardly to the side even when I use the lion head to try and help ease the slumping.
3,"cute, but too small","I bought this for my 9 year old, and while she liked the fact that it was a cat, she said it didn't go far enough around her neck to be useful for sleeping in the car, and that it was too tight. She gave it to her sister, who is a small 7, and that sister likes it, although she hasn't used it for a long trip yet. I think she just likes the cat... Bottom line: cute designs, too small for kids old enough to appreciate the designs, too thick around the back of the neck for little ones in car seats.."
4,"Seems okay, didn't keep around neck.","This one was definitely smaller than the dolphin one. My son (4 yrs) used it more as a pillow in the traditional sense than around the neck. For that image, the dolphin was a little better as it was thicker. This one works better for smaller kids as it was not as large.I don't find that this style has ever worked for me as an adult as it doesn't give much support to the next. I was hoping with the kids having smaller necks that this style would work better. I did not find it to work well for them, either."
5,Must-have item for road trips,"I recently purchased this item in preparation for a road trip, and I'm very happy with it. It is soft, well-made and very comfortable for my 6yr old son, and he still uses it often even though we returned from our trip 2 weeks ago. Great item!"
3,Travel Buddies Dog Pillow,"I purchased these for my 9, 7, & 4 year old. They are really too small for my 9 & 7 yearold but it is almost too small for my 4 year old. So really more for very young children. They are very cute and besided being too small would be perfect."
3,was excited about this pillow,"I bought this neck pillow for my granddaughter, who has gone from a carseat to a booster seat. She falls asleep frequently in the car, so I thought this would be perfect. When it arrived (right on time!!) it was really dirty on one side. It was in an unsealed bag and looked like it was either run over or stepped on. I cleaned it the best I could since it was a birthday gift that I didn't have time to send back. She loves it, but it doesn't hold her head in a comfortable position if she falls asleep. So, I'd say it is great as a stuffed animal, but doesn't do what I thought it should."
2,"Color of Dog Received was Blue, not white & brown as pictured","I purchased this pillow as a gift to go along with the book ""If You Give a Dog a Donut"", but the neck pillow that arrived was light blue with dark blue spots. The picture of the pillow shown was of a white dog with brown spots (just like the one shown on the book). While the quality of the pillow is acceptable, the color is not. Unfortunately, I am stuck using it because I don't have time to find something else."
2,Too Small,"I bought the alligator and the cat for my 4 and 8 year old at Christmas. While they are VERY cute, and both kids like them, the pillow is too small. I bought them specifically for our long trips in the car and I will have to go out and buy some other kind of travel pillow, as these are too small to be a good neck pillow. Would be great for a very small child though."
2,Not impressed ...,I wasn't impressed. It didn't accomplish what I thought it would and didn't provide the neck protection I thought it would on travel. I can count on one hand how many times we used for our twins. I ended up giving away to a non-profit. It just doesn't provide enough support.
4,Mommy ended up using hahahahah,"Hey there,Somehow was too big to fit around toddler's neck comfortably.But mommy enjoyed using it...hahahahahKind regards.Sincerely,Shannon"
1,Still Waiting,"I placed an order on December 13, 2012 for the Cat Noodlehead Travel Buddies Neck Pillow. It is now January 27, 2013 and it still hasn't even been shipped....I am completely disappointed with the service, or the lack thereof."
5,What's Not to Love?,This is a pillow and a teddy bear. What more could you ask for when taking a long trip in the car with the little ones? My three-year-old even asks for it when we're just going on short trips.
5,"Hello, Mr Moose!",The pillow is cute and appealing to children of all ages. It is child-sized which means it will last a child for years and years to come and it's washable!
2,Too big for our 1-year old,"We bought this product for a 2000-mile road trip with our 14-month old. We found it was too thick to be helpful in keeping her head propped up in a good position as she slept to prevent wheezing. If we put it around the back or sides of her neck, her head would fall forward and her breathing wouldn't be smooth. If we put it around the front of her neck, it wouldn't stay put or she would pull it off. On the positive side, it worked reasonably well for me and my 16.5-inch neck, but we will be looking into something more wedge-shaped that goes around the front of the neck for the next trip with our toddler."
5,Great Kids Neck Pillow!,My son loves this super soft and cozy neck pillow! Perfect size for a 2-5 year old.He sleeps better and longer in the car now that his head doesn't slump forward.
2,I wish I had waited - this pillow is not comfortable for a baby,"My daughter is 10 months old and I bought this for her the month before she was born. So far, it is WAY too big for her. When I put it around her neck, her head is propelled forward in an uncomfortable position. Imagine using one of those Boppys in the car around your neck and you get the picture.As far as construction goes, very plush and fairly high quality. It came exactly as pictured.I wish I had waited until she was born because I think it would have been obvious to me that this is unnecessary. I am hoping that in a few years this will be the right size and she can get some use out of it. So far, it just sits at the bottom of her toy box."
2,Not a great product,I bought this hoping I could use it for my son to give more support to his neck when he falls asleep in his swing. The product I received is more yellow than orange and it is way to big for him.I won't go through the trouble of returning it and I hope that it will work for him when he is older but hopefully he won't need it then.
2,Average at best,"These sheets fit and fulfill their function, but hardly feel like ""velvet"". The cotton is rough to the touch and starts to ball up with knots after just a few weeks of use. Bottom line: you get what you pay for!"
3,Great Buy!,"Melba Toast is a great buy on Amazon.com. We had been buying it at the supermarket, one box at a time. We paid approximately $3.50 a box and on Amazon we paid $2.19 a box. We have opened 2 boxes and about half of the Melba Toast in each box had broken pieces. Amazon needs to put a label on the shipping box to handle with care."
2,Good Toast Chips,Old London melba toast is good tasting if you like small pieces. It is packed loosely in the box and so far out of 6 boxes I've only found two slices not broken into pieces. Nothing like paying high dollar for toasted bread that is basically small pieces when you open it up. They definitely need to work on their packaging.
3,Not the best planner.,I chose this planner beause it is ring bound so you can add pages if you need to. Unfortunatly the paper in the binder is extra wide so normal paper does not fit right. Also there is no guest list which was disapointing and there isn't much space for writing ideas. I ended up buying another 3 ring binder and combining the two. The timeline was nice though because most timelines are 12 months long but I only had 6. The timeline in this planner is 6 months long which was helpful.
2,Disappointing details,"This book is beautifully presented. Unfortunately, the information inside is scant. I learned more surfing the web than I did from this book."
5,A really good book!,"The Beginner's Guide to Silk Painting is a joy! Easy to read with lots of demonstration illustrations. For the beginner, the book offers a number of easily understandable techniques and projects that give you a sense of accomplishment. A great purchase!"
4,pretty good,"I like this pillow a lot. A little firmer than I prefer. During a long ride, I have to adjust it a lot or I'll end up with a headache."
3,Made really good,Neck pillow is just to big for the back of my neck. So it did not work for me.My husband loves it.I received on due date
5,Exceptional Show!!!!!,"I can't believe CBS didn't give this show a chance. It was exceptional!!!! I'm glad they've got the DVD, at least. Wish they would have continued it but it's not looking that way. Maybe some other network will pick it up. Great, great show!!!"
5,Swingtown Don't Leave Us Now!,One of the best shows of 2008.I found my self loving this show more each week. Susan had a complex relationship with herself and therefore had complex relationships with everyone around her. I loved her journey and am deeply saddened to see it come to an end.It would be great to see this series move to a premium cable channel like HBO or Showtime.
4,Worthwhile,"It's a good show, but I doubt that CBS will renew it. That is a shame, because it was actually pretty solid. The content is fairly tame despite the subject matter. Perhaps the show will be picked up by another network; I can picture this being even more successful on FX for example.Another reviewer compared this program to ""The Ice Storm"" and said that the movie was better. Duh! ""The Ice Storm"" was fantastic, based on an amazing book, with an Oscar-winning cast and director. That is a MUST SEE flick, no doubt about it. ""Swingtown"" is a different experience, but it is still entertaining and worth your time.If they do continue ""Swingtown"" I will definitely keep watching. If they don't continue, you will probably be disappointed with the way ""Swingtown"" ends. I'm not holding my breath; CBS is probably going to cancel."
1,STOP PUTTING EVERY SHOW ON DVD!!!!,"Why does EVERY show rate a G-D DVD??!! The show fails, and yet...there'sa DVD!!!!"
5,Swingtown 1st Season,We enjoyed the show when it was on TV and now can enjoy the first season. The price was reasonable.
5,One Of The Best Shows Of 2008,"I found SWINGTOWN to be one of the best shows of 2008 - Well acted, well written, well produced. The controversy that surrounded it when it began I think was unwarrented. While yes, there are some scenes of 'swinging', they are not exploitive or tasteles. There is certainly nothing more 'provacative' then you usually see in a daytime soap opera. I think the show focuses primarily on the lives of the main characters who are caught up in a time of change and discovery. While not a perfect show, it is certainly better than most of the garbage that passes as entertainment today. It is original and creative and that alone makes it surpass most of the rehashed series on network TV and certainly any of the endless reality crap that we are subjected to. I hope the DVD set does the show justice and that there will be a Season 2 to follow next year."
1,For once the movie is better,"This book seems like it was written as a trash novel designed to stimulate 19th century schoolboys, who couldn't care less about characterization and just about every other literary ""gimmick"" that makes a book worth reading. The romance is flat and uninspired.This is simply an adventure story for kids {before they grow up and realize how...stupid it is!}"
3,A Shard of a Novel,"This slim volume contains what E.M.F. managed to write before writer's block set in. There is no real plot - the book ends before the plot has any chance to develop - so what you get is a handful of characters and scenes in typically Forsterian style.One cannot help but wonder - would it be a good novel? My impression is that it would not. Certain elements and scenes have been used before (close reading reveals especially similarities to A Room with a View), and there is little new and striking. The central conflict between action and ideas would probably be too little to sustain another novel after Howards End.In short - a necessary reading for any true Forsterian and it is very good that it is finally available in a mass-market paperback (the Abinger edition is very difficult to find) but not necessarily for the general reading public. General reading public, however, should immediately aim for the next novel Forster managed to complete: A Passage to India."
3,"Worth reading, but just barely","I rate this as a mediocre writing effort. To me, the characters were not really well developed and the story, while emotional, was not that interesting. It was worth reading, but I wasn't really sorry to finish it, so I can move on to something better.If you want to read a better, even great, Vietnam novel, I'd recommend you try Fields of Fire by Webb, or Close Quarters by Heinemann, or Better Times than These by Groom. Fragments pales in comparison to those works."
1,Beware,"Used this tea as directed, Drank several cups during the day. Had the worse tummy ache ever that night. Beware."
3,Didn't work for me,"This tea tastes good, it is a licorice flavor, but it didn't work for me. My gas symptoms didn't improve, it seemed to get worse. But not every product works for everyone, even my doctor told me that. Heather's products like her peppermint capsules and tummy fiber are excellent."
2,Not that great,"I don't like the taste of this tea, and it wasn't as helpful for digestive symptoms as I would have hoped. Trader Joe's makes a cheaper (but still very high quality) organic tea with fennel that tastes better."
3,Not too bad,"This product works some, but it by no means totally eliminates flatulence. It may calm it down a bit, but you can still feel it. It does have a mild, pleasant taste, though."
2,Bland,"I don't usually leave low ratings on items, but I was really disappointed with the taste of this tea. It smells really great, but the taste of the brewed tea is really bland, and does not correlate with the aroma of the tea bags in the box. I love fennel tea, and usually buy mine overseas. When I ran out, I purchased this product instead. Sadly disappointing."
1,Strong Fennel,"These are larege tea bags, with about twice as much in them as in Alvita or Seelect fennel tea bags. When I brewed up a cup according to the instructions, it was just too strong for my taste. Maybe you like your tea strong or need it that way for your condition. After trying it several times, I concluded it was just too much for me and went back to other brands. They leave me feeling much better than this does. For those who would need or enjoy it, I'm sure it would be very good."
5,Works for Gastroenterologist,"I rarely leave comments on a product. That being said, I can not say enough about this tea. I work for a gastroenterologist who was looking for an alternative to the traditional medications for IBS. We use it in the recovery room after colonoscopies and give a sample to the patients to take home. Every patient that has been back to the office for a follow-up appointment has nothing but praise. If you suffer with IBS, give it a try."
5,"Great product, a life saver for people with IBS","If you have digestive problems and have tried anything modern medicine can make for you this is your life saver!! I have IBS and I am gluten intollerant as well. After seeing doctors and took all kind of prescriptions (which it helped a bit) I decided to go the old fashion way and try fennel tea. This is the good stuff!! the package came quickly, the tea is real seeds very fresh and organic. I can finally have a peacful meal without dreading the consequences. My tummy is calm and my digestive system is back on track. Its like pouring water on fire :-) For best result follow the instruction.I looked every local food store and could not find a decent organic fennel tea . I was also impressed by the quantity you get for the price.Thank you Amazon !"
4,Personal Poems,"Wandering fires was written by my grandmother's sisters, Mary and Violet McDougal.It is a compilation of intense short poems of the early 1900's. Some seem quite firm and compelling, to me. I like it a lot. I hope you agree."
5,Excellent book to help one get the most out of Mac OSX,"This is a wonderful book for all us souls who use OSX. The techniques are almost always a way to either solve a particular problem or learn a particular tool. I have only gone through about 30 of them, but each one has made my life either a little easier or a lot. A couple of examples are that I know understand how to best utilize the Finder and am no longer intimidated by Terminal. The style is breezy and very easy to understand without being condescending or dumbed-down. Strongly recommended"
4,Boat Hull Only,"Remember this is the hull only, if you wreck the full version. It was what I needed, old one met with tree, boat lost. Took out equipment from wreck and put in this hull, running again."
3,"If you like Edgar Cayce, this is for you","I was expecting more of a dictionary to be able to look up images that occur in my dreams. This book is organized as a series of rambling discussions of different dream experiences and the author's selection of Edgar Cayce reading/sayings to clarify the dream experience. Perhaps, if an editor shortened the book by half, it would be more readable for someone like myself. Also, I did not find the Edgar Cayce remarks to make a lot of sense. But if you are an Edgar Cayce ""person"", perhaps the commentary will make more sense."
5,this duet was past due,"I love this song michael, and janet man this was a good song and was the best r&b song to me in 1995."
2,Hell hath no fury like a pop star scorned!,"So, MJ is angry at the paparazzi, the general public for its criticism of his perceived unusual behavior, and an invasion of his privacy.Michael, have you forgotten that you have spent your entire life in the public eye?Michael, did you not know that fame has a price?Michael, do you have to use the f-word so often on one version of ""Scream""?Michael, what do you think I wanted to do after shelling out fifteen bucks for ""Invincible""?I think I can SCREAM louder!"
4,High Quality,"This is a great item...the metal is finished so there arent sharp edges, its strong even at 5 feet tall, the screw holes are recessed so you can set them flush when you screw it to the wall.Just one warning, the bracket holes are the horizontal clip type and not the regular vertical bracket type!"
2,"For an outline of what you need to know, ok - for real test prep, pass please.","With effort and the internet, this book may work for some people, but for most people this book will simply fail as a test prep. Many points that are brought up in the book are not explained and will require additional research on part of the reader.Telling the reader that ""you need to know...(insert general topic related to PCs)"" doesn't really help prepare for test.Also, another bad point: factual inaccuracies. The one that annoyed me the most was the author's description of bluetooth and the claim that it required line of sight (like IrDA) to work. Bluetooth has been around for a long time and it does not require line of sight.Only good point I can see this book is it is relativly cheap, and if you have been working with computers for a long time and need a certificate to prove it, this book may help you know which subject matter needs more review."
2,Get the complete study guide,"This book is outdated and not very useful. If you know the material, it is simply review. If you don't know it and are really trying to study for the test, this book does not have enough information. Skip it and get the ""Complete study guide"". By looking at even the sample tests of that book, you can tell it is a much better read.Don't waste your money here."
1,Worst Study Book,"I agree completely with reviewer Brenden Davidson...This book is filled with so many errors that it's not worth reading. I've spent more time researching facts that I thought were wrong, than actually using this book to study.Some examples:Bluetooth is an infrared technology??? ATA-3 has better performance than ATA-6???I am extremely disappointed with this book and highly recommend you buy a different one. I wish I could get a refund."
1,A+ Third pass with a new book should be the new title,"I wanted to prove to everyone that this book was good, until I failed my A+ twice. I bought a new book and passed right away. So what if it's cheap, it will cost you more in the long run.The writer lives about an hour away from me in Anderson, Indiana and people say that people there are simple minded and make fun of the place constantly. So what was I expecting."
3,Okay for a brush up.,"This is a decent guide if you are already knowledgeable and need to get a review. However, if you are starting from scratch you should get a more complete study manual."
4,A+ certification,"I needed this book in order to study for my networking certification for my job. so far, very helpful."
4,Excellent bowls.,"I am very pleased with these bowls. They are perfect for all sorts of things that the teeny, weeny bowls that come with a service of this china are too small to accomplish (must be a European thing.) The bowls are a nice size for tossed salad, soup, stew or pasta (of course.) They are very pretty and arrived extremely well packed with not a scratch on them."
1,Bowls arrived broken due to very poor packaging.,"The bowls arrived today in their box, in 100's of pieces, tossed into a bigger box with completely inadequate padding. It is no wonder they are all broken. Today is 1-6-2010. Buyer beware. I love amazon, but this is second time breakable things have arrived broken, due to poor packaging."
1,Unhappy with product,I received two shipments for this product. They were both received broken into many pieces. The dishes had no protection during shipment. Please notify shipping department to pack these items correctly!
5,High level thinking and writing on marketing,"The book provides a brilliant and easily digestable historical overview of ""old"" and ""new"" marketing and corporate strategy. Upon this foundation the book describes the current state of commerce and makes reccommendations for successful corporate strategy.If you have read several marketing related books, the material may not seem revolutionary; however, the writing and clear thinking in this book puts it in a league of its own and creats its value. The book very effectively synthesizes history, theory, and the current state of corporate strategy and notably enhanced my thinking on marketing."
2,Nothing New,This book has focused too much on E-commerce.It does not provide something new on the issue of strategic marketing.I feel disappointed with the famous author.
2,One Among Many,"The book begins with great promise with the authors doing a great job of capturing the impact of the internet, globalization and hyper-competition on the concept of marketing.The authors introduce a new marketing paradigm called holistic marketing, and present a ""holistic marketing"" framework. The rest of the book is devoted to describing various elements of this framework.The book dissappoints from the point this new framework is presented. It ends up being a compilation of information on business systems and applications for customer-centric marketing. The latter half of the book lacks depth. All said, the book doesn't stand apart from some of the others on this subject and is one among many."
1,Please pass this one by...,"What a disappointment. Wish I knew what Roger Corman had to do with them. We watched several and he was not mentioned in the credits at all. To add insult to injury, disk #3 was damaged and glitchy. We thought that all the movies needed a guy in a rubber monster suit to improve them. This is a virtually unwatchable set. We love Roger Corman movies and have the best of the worst. This is awful. It was about 3 hours of my life I'll never get back. I would have rather changed the litter box. Twice."
1,An unbelievable plot combined with flat characters,"Having read the first few chapters on the Baen site, I was intrigued. The book seemed to have all the making of a good techno-political thriller, though even then it seemed a little bit overdone. Unfortunately, from about Chapter 3-4 onwards the book took a turn for the worse...much worse. The character's motivation were really bizarre, and their reactions to the plot's meanderings were even worse. I strongly recommend giving this book a pass."
3,great book,Loved this book as a kid im sure you will also.it us a great comparison of different personality typesArtwork is simple but nice
3,better editing please!,"I own many Naxos Musical Journey videos; most are relaxing - beautiful scenery accompanied by beautiful music. In a few the choice of scenes to show seems off, considering the landscapes, city sites, etc. from which to choose when editing. In this one there is nearly 8 minutes of harbor scenes in Oslo, showing closeups of sailboats, their riggings, etc. A lot of this time could have been put to better use in my opinion. Most of the rest of the video is very nice. As with all of them, an occasional subtitle letting the viewer know what is being shown would be helpful."
3,"Been there, envisioned that",Soothingly tribal new age of the not-too-offensive variety nonetheless gets by on similarly stereotypical sounds of shaman showboating.
2,"Those who left never really ""part of the fold"" to begin with","I bought this book hoping that it would provide a glimpse into why Mormons leave the LDS Church. While it did accomplish this objective in a limited sense, I was disappointed that include a majority of stories by what I consider to be ""cultural Mormons"" (born in the LDS Church but not practicing). I guess I was hoping for a view of Mormons who, after study and thought, left the church because of doctrinal differences, historical problems, and so on. Many in this book claimed that they had never read the ""Book of Mormon"" from cover to cover or had not read it seriously. So while the stories were interesting, many of the people in the book were never really ""part of the fold"" to begin with (head and heart -- never really ""converted"" to the Mormon faith)."
4,A teenage coming of age story,"The plot appears to be a near future sci-fi story about an old man who is turned young again through the miracle of science, and the wacky hijinks that ensue. But as I read through, I came to realize that this book is about the teenage son; his coming of age story. The old then young again father could easily be replaced with a father having a mid-life crisis, and the time setting changed to anything after 1990 with no effect to the plot. That said, it is still an entertaining read, and I am glad that I read it. The characters are well put together, the interactions believable, and each person has their own backstory which accurately describes how they came to be. his is a well told tale, worth your time to read, but won't become an everlasting classic."
1,Too much soap-opera not enough sci-fi.,"The original rejuvenation is the only real piece of sci-fo in the book, the rest is slightly over-the-top and, more importantly, uninteresting soap opera.Didn't bother finishing it once the pattern of boredom set in."
1,Waste of time,"This book sadly fails to deliver anything close to the author's usual standards. Despite the fact that his book is supposed to be about man's first attempt at rejuvination, that plays a very small part in the book. The rest of the book is dull and boring a lot of the time and fails to engage the reader. Also the emphasis is primarily about his son."
1,Dull.,"Everything else I have read by Peter F. Hamilton is vastly more imaginative and entertaining, and I intend to purchase his next book based upon all those others."
3,Okay,"Okay book, however sometimes lengthly and the writing could be better. I love Peter F. Hamilton but I know he does better."
2,Not my idea of a science fiction.,The story was a disappointment to me because I thought it was a science fiction story. The only science was it takes in the future and some complications with making a person young and healthy.
2,Peter Hamilton's worst work,"A maundering, tedious tale of the lives of a mid 21st century family, who are simultaneously unlikeable and shallowly rendered. This is interspersed by Dan-Brown-esque middle aged fantasies of relations with far younger women. And, compared to Hamilton's best work, this is all poorly written. If you're in the mood for a dose of British SF, skip this and re-read something from Iain Banks instead."
3,"OK, but wait for the paperback","I love near-future but it's difficult to pull off the technical details. This book pulls it off, and with a premise that everyone can relate to. The characters are generally strong and I enjoyed the political backdrop (without being whacked over the head with it).What drove down the enjoyment for me was that Hamilton seems to insult the reader's intelligence by regularly telegraphing major plot developments well in advance. The two greatest surprises in the book were foreshadowed pretty heavily, and as far as I could tell for no good reason. If I want that sort of thing I'll watch network television.Lots of sex, so if that's offensive take a pass.Worth my time, but not worth hardcover $$."
2,Choose any other Hamilton title,"What utter crap.After reading the Night's Dawn trilogy and Fallen Dragon, I eagerly snatched and bought this one. While the concept of rejuvenation hasn't been explored fully, and the way in which Hamilton deals with EU politics of the future is entertaining enough, the novel's degeneration into bad character development and description, lousy ending and all-too-predictable scenes made me wonder if it was the same author.All in all, one star for the steamy scenes - just because you don't get much of those in mature SF - and one star for the well-developed world - because after all my ranting, it is still a good setting. But the book as a complete work is bad. Very bad."
1,Love his books...hate THIS book...,"I have absolutely loved Peter F. Hamilton's novels, but this book was unreadable. Is is one of the few books that I have ever stopped reading midway through. NOTE - as pre-reading for the Commonwealth series, you need not read this book. It is referred to in cursory fashion in the next five books but i gained very little insight into the Commonwealth world as a result of flogging myself with this book."
1,A Disappointment,"I've enjoyed other books by Peter F. Hamilton, specifically the Reality Dysfuction series, and I'm sorry I wasted my time with this tripe.This book was too heavy on the steamy sex and neglected the other important elements, namely character development and the plot. While the book is fairly well-written, it's basically a soap opera set in a mildly dystopian future. The entire time I read the book, I was hoping it would get better. It never did."
1,disappointing,The only reason I'm writing a negative review of this book is because I'm a fan of Peter Hamilton's science fiction and I'd prefer that other readers don't pick up this one and judge the rest of his work colored by the experience of having read this one first.
1,Booooooo Mr. Hamilton,"I love most of Peter Hamiltons books, but this was a complete waste. A jungle sniper with PMS is easier to anticipate/follow than the Misspent Youth storyline."
2,Bland!,The main character (Jeff) is poorly realized. I'm not sure what the point is (other than the author does not like the European Union).
4,"Great Movie, Poor Video Quality","Not sure what was up, but my video quality of this movie (Amazon Instant Vid.) was really grainy and poor quality. Love the movie though. One of the few new movies where I start laughing at the beginning and don't stop till after the credits."
4,LMFAO!!!,One of the recent best comedies I have seen...Cant help stop cracking myself...excellent entertainer....may not be advisable to watch with kids.
3,The Hangover- UNRATED (2009),"It's ok, not boring. I prefer part 1 better. Very Unfunny comedy. But any movie that takes me to another country and shows the world, is definately worth watching."
3,Not hungover from this movie,"I waited for this movie for a long time and heard so many positive things; needless to say I was not disappointed but still not completely satisfied as is usually the case with movies that have been incessantly hyped. A word of caution: this movie is only mildly funny and watchable but not the funniest comedy ever.Some crazy characters, witty one -liners and funny dialogues make this a a fun watch. Mike Tyson is hilarious but the real star of the movie is Zack Galifianakis. I liked the movie but it deserved only three stars. 3/22/10"
4,Enjoying this movie caught me by suprise.....,"I was susprised that I laughed as hard and enjoyed this movie as much as I did. These types of movies are hit/miss for me. I actually watched the Netflix copy and then ordered a blu-ray for myself. I thought it would be cruder or more ""man/boy"" humor but it is just an overall fun film that...yeah...has its foul points but they are funny and to be truthful...most people would at least think it if not say it. So...enjoy the show!!Female Movie Fan"
4,"Very good, but not as hilarious as expected","This movie was a great buy. However, it wasn't as groundbreakingly hilarious as all media outlets led me to believe. No regrets, though. I'll definitely watch this again and again."
3,funny funny funny,"some good belly laughs, thankfully you dont have to watch a bunch of people acting like they're drunk through the whole movie. a keeper comedy that I will watch over and over. I'll put it next to my old school, superbad and what about bob dvds!"
4,Hillarious,"At the beginning I didn't think I would like it but as it progressed it became more funny. Could have used less of the ""F"" word though."
5,Extremely Funny!!!,"This movie is incredibly hilarious and had a great storyline with great actors! That baby was adorable. Doug is going to be married in two days, so his friends Phil, Stu, and Alan take him to Vegas for his bachelor party. The next day, they wake up and can't remember anything about the night before, find a baby, and can't find Doug. They get into crazy misadventures trying to figure out what happened, arrested by the police, figure out who the baby belongs to, and try to find their friend before the wedding. I highly recommend THE HANGOVER!!!"
2,Not as funny as everyone says,Overrated people! It started off real slow and only had a few funny parts later on. I can dig dumb comedies but I'm sick of the whole grown men acting like frat boys gig. Maybe if you're 17 you'll think its funny but not if you're into good comedy.
3,Less funny each time,"Hubby and I thought that this movie was so funny the first time that we watched it...so we decided to buy it. So glad I got such a great deal on it. It seems to be less funny after the first time you watch it. I think that part of what made it so great the first time was that you didn't expect it to happen...Maybe we will just put it away for a few years and then pull it back out to be ""unexpecting"" again. Great actors, just not so funny the more times you watch it."
2,Amazon description is wrong,"This Blu Ray is not 1.77:1 as stated in the amazon description. When I received it, the package clearly says 2.40:1, which means you are going to get the black bars. I bought this based on the description that said 1.77:1 thinking I wasn't going to get the black bars. I will try to return it, and Amazon should change the description."
1,Are you flipping serious? This was as funny as golf.,"Ya. Kinda a waste of my $14.99 on demand purchase. So many people have said this was the funniest movie they've seen in a long time? Really? Wow, the movie Idiocracy is coming true. No slap stick, no real humor, nothing really funny at all. More like a weird adventure... and that's it. There are so many films thousands of times funnier than this. Its a bit embarrassing how not-funny it is. That'll be the last time I listen to anyone.I'm not sure the unrated version has anything the rated doesn't. Agh, what a waste of my time.I could write a novel on how bad this movie is. Boo."
1,Funniest ever made!,"This was the funniest comedy ever made! Spoiler alert: I could not stop laughing when I saw a baby in sunglasses. Get it? A baby in sunglasses? LOL. Or, a tiger in the bathroom? There is a tiger in the bathroom! LOL, LOL. And then, just when I frantically tried to catch a breath between laughs, there was this naked man jumping out of the trunk of a car. LOL, LOL, LOL.""The Hangover"" confirms the saying, that a sense of humor is a sign of intelligence. Yes! The lower one's IQ, the more things will make one laugh real hard. LOL, LOL, ROFLMAO."
5,Funny as heck!,This movie (especially the unrated version) is worth adding to your collection! It is funny as hell! I must have watched it over 6 times now and still going! Definitely recommend
4,Super funny movie but sound quality was a bit odd,"The movie was hilarious and definitely worth watching if you are into low brow humor. Everything about it was so wrong that it was hilarious. What was great about the plotting of the movie was that it kept you guessing and wanting to find out how the heck they got into the situations they were in.The sound quality of the bluray itself was a bit low. I had to turn the volume all the way up to 25 or 30 to be able to hear the dialogue. I am wondering if this bluray requires that you have an external sound system of some sort to boost the volume. If this is the case, this should be pointed out somewhere on the cover or disc itself."
2,One Lame,"This movie fell way short of my expectations, was totally predictable and had some of the worst acting/actors I've seen to date. It's only merit is that it is more entertaining than Hangover II which I also bought and watched right after this one. I had just had surgery the day before and was pilled up and still this film failed to provide any real humor. This is destined to be a Walmart $1.00 special, so just wait until then if you think you need to see it."
3,"Not as good as Hangover 2, but funny.",The movie was funny. However I saw Hangover 2 first and surprisingly I found the sequel to be funnyer then the original. It was entertaining and helped me relate to the characters in the second movie.
1,Boring,I found this movie to be anything but funny. I cannot understand how anyone could give this a good rating.I was particulary upset with the scene with the baby masterbating. Where the heck was anyone's brain when this movie was shot?
1,Nothing Funny Unless You Like to Watch Monkeys Throw Poo,"There was nothing funny in this movie except for Ken Jeong, the purse carrying triad leader. Every part of this movie just keeps you wondering--who would do something so stupid?? Most of the humor is just plain gross. I would liken it to watching an animal, let's say monkeys, throwing feces at each other. There's some suspense in this movie--but of course it's of the ""no don't do something stupid AGAIN"" type of suspense. There's not even a point to this movie other than guys getting their buddy messed up at a bachelor party weekend and trying to fix their screw up when they can't find him. Although another movie, Bruno, was fairly gross, it was making a point--making fun of how consumer driven, prejudiced, and egotistical American culture is. The Hangover has as poor of a story as Old School and I just wish I'd never wasted my time watching this thing. Stay away from this movie unless you enjoy shows like Jackass and American Pie."
4,"The best R-rated comedy since ""Wedding Crashers""","I was reluctant to see this movie since I was indifferent to Todd Phillips previous comedy, ""Old School"", but I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself laughing at the antics and mishaps of these middle aged men who discover utter chaos when they find their Las Vegas hotel room ravaged and with wild animals. All the actors are fine but special mention should be made of Bradley Cooper formerly the swinest suitor of Rachel McAdams in ""Wedding Crashers"", who's superb here as the confused bachelor who's trying to make sense of the chaos. If you're depressed in these tough financial times--this comedy will bring you out of it."
5,Great movie for a great price!,I loved the movie! It came with the digital copy and I added it to my IPod. Love it! Great Price!!!!
2,"a skit, turned movie","The writer took an oft-used skit (the ""I did WHAT last night when I was drunk?#!?"") and prolonged it to movie length. I knew exactly what I was in for, 24 minutes into the film.That being said, I have the crude, sick sense of humor movies liked this are tailored for, yet I only found myself laughing, maybe, twice throughout the entire film (and just briefly at best). I laughed hysterically through Mary, Borat, American Pie, Jackass, etc. and even Bruno, but, this movie didn't do anything for me. It very nearly bored me.Maybe it was because most of the ""hilarious"" incidents in the film were nothing I hadn't seen before in a plethora of other movies? Naturally, you can't expect a movie to be 100% original and unique; especially a comedy. But it seems like the writer made no attempt at it.I still enjoyed it enough to stay in my seat, but to nowhere near the degree that a majority of these other reviews emit. IMO, the movie was definitely overrated."
1,Predicatble and boring,"This is one of the truly most disapointing movies I have ever watched. Whoever made this threw every cliche' from every other bachelor party movie into a pot and cooked up this mess. Boring. Don't bother. Wow, it's a sad state of affairs when a movie this bad gets so many positive reviews. Don't get me wrong, I love stupid, crude, funny movies, but I struggled to work up a chuckle or two during this thing."
1,cant download!!!,"Bought the movie but cant download to kindle!!! I can watch, but the download tab is half hidden under the watch tab!!! Don't have Internet access where I want to watch. Gonna send back kindle if this is the crap I gotta deal with."
1,Too Old for This,"I picked this up on disc because I had encountered various mentions online of people finding it hilarious, and I dote on comedy. This one is slickly produced though sickly written from an unswervingly adolescent point of view. Comedy works best when one or more of the characters is sympathetic: we laugh at the terrible difficulties this character gets into while hoping for him to triumph over them in the end.I was able to generate no such hope for these four guys. My sympathies were more engaged by the Las Vegas people, seen and unseen, whose job it was to clean up after these slobs. Personally, I thought the stripper that the dentist married a far more suitable mate than the fiancee with whom he had already built a wretchedly dysfunctional relationship. So, while the quartet does indeed get into terrible difficulties, my greatest hope was for them to wend their way toward a Darwin Award."
3,Enjoyable movie; Poor sound quality,"We enjoyed the movie itself, but could hardly hear it. Is there a process or someone to call when this happens?"
3,pretty good comedy,"i thought this movie was pretty funny, enjoyed watching it. i would recommend this movie. it will keep you amused. the actors does a great job as well."
5,I Couldn't Stop Laughing,"I had virtually given up on comedy movies. Ever since the 80's ended, I've seen more disappointing comedy movies than non. Too many have been dramatic comedies and, in my opinion, weren't funny. Matter of fact, most of the funny movies since the 80's have been parodies. Finally, I decided to give this movie a chance.I laughed so hard I my abdominal muscles became soar. It was that deep laughter that comes only rarely but goes straight to your soul. This movie is so ridiculously funny that I was blown away. The amount of random happenings could floor even the grumpiest person. The best quality of Hangover is that it is consistently funny. From beginning to end, you're going to be laughing hysterically. It just doesn't stop, right up through the credits.Warning: If you don't like swearing or sexual humor, or obscene behavior, you'll hate this movie. If you find that stuff funny, get in on this."
1,Don't understand the hype about this movie,"I heard this movie is so funny that you'll laugh your butt off. I compared notes with a couple friends whose reaction was similar to mine. This was not funny to me. What made it not funny to me is that practically 99% of the stuff in here that happened was unrealistic. And I find these unrealistic movies to not be entertaining. The only part of it that I recall seemed realistic was when that one character was going to the bathroom, and instead of just turning his head, he turned his entire body while still taking care of business at the toilet. That I could see happening if somebody was drunk.There are various types of humor out there, but not everyone likes all types of humor. I think comedies need to have a subcategory according to the type of humor to help people to further identify if they like it or not. And this is not my type of humor."
2,mediocre,not really funny- predictable. silly sophmoric delve into arrested development. Cliches abound. I imagine that the second movie is the same?
1,"Unfunny, total waste of time","I agree with the others who gave this a one-star review. I watched it as so many people said it was ""hilarious"" and a sequel was made. But I didn't laugh once. It was less a comedy than a bumbling mystery to figure out what happened the previous night. If you want something that aims at college-age humor, watch Animal House. This is a waste of time and money."
1,Hungover Watching This Nonsense,"The fact that anyone thought this was a funny, charming movie makes me want to resign from the human race. Mistreatment of a baby, defiling of anything decent about relationships, an unfunny script, etc. etc....anyone who liked this movie is an idiot. Period."
1,One of the worst.,"Absolutely one of the worse movies out there, the plot and the acting were atrocious, sure the trailers were funny, that was what influenced me to rent the movie. This is one of those movies after watching it you say ""Omigod people pay money to see this"" luckey for me I only spent $1.99 to rent it. A real stinkeroo."
1,Hangover with a major headache,"This movie was very painful to watch. I watched it with my hubby and by the time the movie was midway through, we couldn't wait for it to end. It started out funny enough, but then it quickly went down hill from there...and it just kept going... and going...and going. First of all, there's dearth of material to be had about a guy who's about to get married. He went to Vegas with his buddies to enjoy the last few days as a bachelor and everybody got drunk and don't remember anything in the morning. Fine. We got that. What we didn't get was the AWFUL stereotyping of the Asian guys, as well as the stereotyping of the possessive girlfriend. It's one cliche after another! What pushed us over the edge was the sexual innuendo used on the baby. That was really, REALLY, a bad taste in filmmaking! (Don't we have enough perverts?) Mike Tyson was great playing himself. In fact, the actors in this movie were great playing their part. It was the script that sucked."
1,what a let down,"Wow, after all the hype and good reviews I found this movie boring and dumb. I just couldn't find the humor in most of it and it was poor acting and a poor story. I still don't get why people thought it was funny. I would recommend Jim Carey's movies like Dumb and Dumber, Pet Detective and The Mask if you want truly funny, well scripted movies."
1,Am I missing something?,"I think this is one of the most overrated comedies of all time,the acting was fine but the writing was weak and predictable..I almost didn't finish it but figured it had to get better...I was wrong"
1,Majorly disappointing,"I was SO looking forward to the laugh-fest I'd been promised by several people - mix of male and female friends. Wow, was I ever disappointed in this waste of time and space. I never - ever - laughed out loud. I was actually hoping that the tiger would EAT Zach what's-his-face. Just awful. Not even mildly entertaining. To each his own, I guess, just not for me. Too bad I can't give it 0 stars. Ugh."
3,"""From the makers of 'The Wedding Crashers'"" says it all. Acquired taste for sure.","I had umpteen people tell how gut busting hilarious this movie was (just like The Wedding Crashers.) Most over rated comedy in the same league as ""the W.Crashers,"" and ""Dodgeball."" Cheap, been there, heard that punch lines, done better elsewhere at that. And people laughing because the rest of the lemmings are. This movie is so weak, so h.s. lunchroom humor, that it made me shudder at all the claims of greatness. It's not bad. But the fact I didn't laugh mostly until the credits says a lot about this flick. I ain't saying you won't find parts of this movie funny. But even Super Bowl commercials with groin shots gets laughs. I'll bet if put on a polygraph, many who claim this movie great would electricute themselves."
1,Horrible - DVD didn't work- either the blue ray or the digital...tried it on 5 differnt players..,so disappointed! LOVED this movie and gave it to my husband for christmas..But it didn't work. the DVD stated I needed some type of cable? tried it on several different players and none of them worked.wish i could return it...feel like i was scammed.
1,Single-handedly setting the cinema back 100 years,"Seriously. Charlie Chaplin was more sophisticated than The Hangover.Lame. Un-funny. This movie is the equivalent a child with a booger on the end of his finger sticking it out at you and expecting you to laugh. Funny to him, not to me.In addition, this film is proof Roger Ebert can no longer be trusted. The blurb on the back of the box quotes Ebert as rating this three and a half stars, with this assessment: ""Now this is what I'm talkin' about. A funny movie, flat out, all the way through.""There's nothing wrong with dumbness and wackiness. Laurel and Hardy. I rest my case. But that was inspired dumbness. Seinfeld was inspired wackiness. This is recycled, clumsy, cheap, easy, obvious dumbness. Seinfeld without the inspiration."
1,The Hangover,"Never recieved item and was promised a replacement item 10 days ago, but still havent recieved it. I would rate the purchase as HORRIBLE!"
1,Explicit images in a R-rated movie?,"I don't understand how Hollywood can legally make a movie that can be shown to children accompanied by an adult that contains sexually explicit images. Don't people get arrested for doing stuff like this? I know everyone will say it's on the parents to monitor what movies their children are watching, but what is the NC-17 rating for if not for this type of movie?"
1,stupid and not funny,"I just rented and watched this tonight... well, tried to watch it.I could barely get through the first 20 minutes of the movie. ALL the characters are unsympathetic. I could not care less about what happens to them.It's a sad day in this country that this is what passes for humor."
5,Crazy!,"This movie must be seen before Hangover II to understand the plot. Crazy, silly antics are very entertaining, never a dull mment!"
5,One of our favorite comedies,"It was purchased as a gift for someone who requested it, but a fun movie to have on hand. We have another that we have sent to relatives to share (it has been to several cities in FL, NY, and PA.)"
3,Tears from laughing,A lot more hilarious than I was told. My sides hurt so bad from laughing I couldn't stand it.
5,Love it,I don't think I have to say much about this movie. It is increditably funny and is a cult hit
3,fun movie,The romance is predictable and a little weak but movie has lots of funnies. The main male actors are good.
3,"Funny ""frat/buddy"" type movie.","Definitely a great ""best man"" day-before type movie, full of all kinds of crazy stuff happening on 1 night in Vegas."
3,A GOOD WATCH BUT NOTHING SPECIAL....3.5,A GOOD WATCH BUT NOTHING SPECIAL. Some laughs but not outstandingly good....I would have thought that with all the hype that it would be that great...... still a good watch though...
3,Great film...extreme edition not what was described.,"I bought this edition, because it shows on amazon as being 128 minutes in length. However, when I received the item in the mail I noticed it was just the same length (108 minutes) as the regular extended edition. Save your hard-earned cash and purchase the $12.99 edition of the movie, because it IS an awsome flick. I just don't feel that the extra ""behind the scenes"" footage should be worth an extra 20 dollars, especially if you already bought the film when it was released originally."
5,They should make a second one!,"Looove this movie, even tough some of my girl friends hate it, (especially the one that was supposed to get married next year). Sooo funny, the producers should make a second one, with the same writers!"
5,I love this movie,This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and Blu Ray makes it look fantastic. The unrated scenes are surprising not explicit and mostly are irrelevant explanations of things that could have just been left unexplained (they were in the theatrical release anyway). Overall a great purchase.
3,GREAT MOVIE-- EXTRAS SUCK 2DISC is waste of money,funniest movie of all time... the 2 disc dvd extras suck and are pretty much the same pictures u see at the end of the movie... wait for the special edition or another release in a few years to buy another 2 disc version... save the money and get the 1 disc..... SERIOUSLY DO IT...
2,acceptable but not amazing,"I thought this was going to be a raunchy teen comedy. It wasn't.I stuck through it because it got a series of positive reviews, at least if you check on Metacritic, and I couldn't figure out why.The story is well put together and well-directed, but for me it's not funny enough to be an outrageous comedy, not charming enough to be a romantic comedy, and not perceptive enough to offer any real insights into life. Or getting married."
2,"kept waiting for the funny, but nothing happened","i heard so much about The Hangover being a real funny movie, but i've got to say, The Hangover sucked.i think House Bunny was funnier than The Hangover.Bradley Cooper, who came out in movies like The Rocker and Yes Man, is terrible as a leading man. His acting was too cheesy and even when he dropped F-bombs, they felt forced out of his mouth.Hangover was way too corny and honestly not funny.Todd Philips usually makes good movies, (Road Trip, Old School, Starsky and Hutch) but The Hangover is terrible."
1,movie stumped,"I have ordered on amazon before and never had a problem. I ordered my movie from this seller in December and it is now the end of Jan and I never received it.I had to contact amazon to get my money back because the seller would not reply back to my emails.Amazon did credit back my account, which I am happy about,BUT Whatever you do, do not order from this seller.It will be a waste of time and money."
1,Bluray Commentary Only???,"This is just a short review of the DVD release. I loved ""The Hangover"". BUT! SHAME ON WARNER HOME VIDEO FOR HAVING THE COMMENTARY TRACK ON THE BLU-RAY RELEASE ONLY! FROM EARLY DVD REVIEWS I HAVE READ, THE SCANT EXTRAS ON THIS SO CALLED ""SPECIAL EDITION"" DVD RELEASE, SUCK! AND WITH NO COMMENTARY TRACK ON EITHER DVD RELEASES I WOULD SAY IT REALLY SUCKS! You would think that a comedy that made $280 Million dollars domestically would have better extras. ""You Don't Mess With The Zohan"" has better extras than this crappy DVD release. Hey Warner! Not everybody has Blu-ray yet! O.K.!?"
3,No commentary on non-blue ray???,"From what I can tell, only the blu-ray version has any kind of commentary with it, and it's a video commentary. Does anyone know if that's correct? The DVD-only version has no commentary whatsoever? I have to buy a blu-ray player if I want commentary on this movie? Total crap."
1,Was never able to download,I was neve able to download the movie and never down a solution to e problem ...it only said that I may have logged in with another account..I don't have another account!!!!!!!!
1,Amazon Kindle a total ripoff,"Once again, I download and pay for a movie before getting on a flight and once I am airborne -----nothing there to watch... Amazon customer service in some faraway place with a person who barely spoke English was no help at all -- all he could say was ""no refunds on digital purchases."" A total ripoff.Oh yes -- the movie -- I still haven't seen it...."
2,Less Than Sophomoric At Best,"What a waist of time. I can not reemember the last time I saw a film with no redeeming graces. Like Mike Tysen himself (in this film)it has no finesse and bludgeons the viewer with attempts at sight humor. Don't expect memorable one liners either. In the end you will feel like your ear has been chewed on and wonder, what you are doing in the same building with this film."
3,Self therapy,"Same o same o. Self therapy is hard to do, better off with therapist. If a couple has several issues this would be hard to use without a very competent third party."
1,You Will Be Disappointed,"The Marketing people did a great job on the hype for this stinker.All the funny parts of the movie you have already seen in the ads for the movie.This was supposed to be a comedy, but it was certainly not very funny. Hard to watch, wanted to turn it off but figured I had already paid for it, might as well suffer through it.Please do not bother purchasing this film. It will be on television very soon.Watch it some night when you want to fall asleep."
1,"Not one positive thing to report on this movie unless you're high on cocaine or ""date drug"" when you watch it!","This movie is absolutely the worst movie I've ever tried to watch. It is not funny but rather pathetic and degrading to both women and the portrayed poor excuses for post-college adolescents and perverts who should be drafted into the military immediately to just GROW UP! I left after about 15 minutes, but my wife watched it through because she ""heard"" it was nominated for ... something. For what??? Animal House was a monumental achievement compared to this trash! And, I'll bet the fans of that movie agree with me on this review!"
1,Not Funny,"This movie was NOT funny, and I honestly watched it with an open mind, after a couple of people told me how funny it was. Funny? Not even a little bit. Very, very, very stupid. I cannot believe all these people giving it four and five-star ratings! Wow."
5,Why are you reading this? Go watch it!,"This is definately the best comedy of 2009! The plot is very simple, a bunch of guys party to much in vegas and the next day they can't remember what happened. There friend is missing and all these weird things start to happen. What the hell happened last night! This movie is so funny. I've watched it about a million times. I even heard they are already working on a sequel because it made so much at the box office. I can't wait. If you still have not seen this, Go Watch Right Now!"
3,Watered down.,"Not a bad movie, but not nearly as funny as the premise. The opening scene sets us up for a very funny, and somewhat ominous, excursion, but the funny is too tame and the ominous is nearly nonexistant. I didn't want this to go as far into dark territory as ""Very Bad Things"" by any means (""Very Bad Things"" was a superior movie in every way, but one is plenty), but it could have used a lot more edge.I will give them credit for not making the second half into a chick flick, like ""Wedding Crashers"", ""I Love You, Man"", and most other guy films made these days. If I wanted to watch a chick flick, I'd watch some pieces of crap with Amy Adams or Jennifer Anniston in it. Never resorting to the maudlin bull**** so commonly used to appeal to the female demographic is commendable, but ""The Hangover"" is still too watered down."
4,Funny and almost suspenseful...,"So through the whole movie you're wondering what happened the night before, especially as the day progresses and more people talk to these gentlemen. HA! Although, I did figure out where the missing one was in the beginning, it is still a hilarious movie to see. I don't know if I want to say that the extra pictures from the missing camera is worth the extra money spent, there are some photos during credits. BUT...I will say the movie is something I will watch several times. As for comedy movies, yeah, it's one worth buying if you like to giggle and chuckle..."
4,Fast delivery - poor packaging,"couldn't wait to get my hands on this movie. though used, this dvd was very good condition and the price was unbeatable (so i thought). watched it about 4 times and still no issues with the dvd freezing up. however the dvd case was crushed when i received it (hence the ""so I thought""). i'm amazed the dvd wasn't cracked. the package that the case was in very tightfitted and provided no protection. wasn't worth it financially to return the item so i taped up the case instead. for me a great movie - made me forget about the mangled package."
2,Hangover,"Sophmoric humor. Will appeal to men in the under 35 age. Way too much use of the ""F"" word. Bought this with Bridesmaids and Hangover part 2."
5,Hangover,This movie is great. I laugh very hard every time i see it. I would definitely recommend buying this dvd.
2,It was just OK,I was told that this was the funniest movie ever made. Maybe my expectations were too high. I have seen much funnier movies and shows. It didn't have me laughing out loud even. It was just OK to me. Just not my kind of humor and comedy.
1,this is supposed to be funny?,"Could have been funny, but played into every sterotype. Also, I just don't find jokes about endagering and harming babies funny."
5,The Hangover,"This is the best and funniest movie of 2009. I really enjoyed it! ""Alan"" is by far the funniest character in there. Without him it might not have been as funny!!!!!"
2,Lame.,Barely funny and obnoxious. Hollywood has gotten disgusting with it's inability to produce something hilarious without putting perverted crap to try and make it seem funny. Gross.
3,Just an OK movie,"From what people told me I expected a really funny movie. It did have funny parts but overhaul i wasn't impressed. Do Date was much funnier. Zach Galifianakis was great, really like him. We did discuss the movie the next day and chuckled. Give it a shot."
1,worst movie i ever saw,"This is the most perverted, disorganized movie I ever saw. I bought it based on reviews that were better than Bridesmaids--Bridesmaids may have been perverted as well, but the acting and comedy were actually very funny. I could not sit through this trash though. It should not get any stars. I am burning this video--not worth selling it back for what Amazon wants to pay for it."
4,funny movie,"funny movie, but not for kids. There are some life lessons that can be pulled away from it for older teens, but a good adult flick."
3,Not all that funny,"With all the talk and even a second movie, I was expecting a rip roaring comedy but I was sadly disappointed. Though some of the situations are remenecent of some of the things me and my buddies got into (waking up on a water tower without a clue as the how we got there or how to get down), it just wasn't funny. I'll admit, there were a couple of chuckles but that's it. And the gay oriental guy was just discusting. They could have left this charecter out all together. I understand that he is suppose to be a popular comedian; if that's true then the world has lost their funny bone.I have no intention of seeing second movie and would not recomment this one."
4,Breath of fresh air!,This is a breath of fresh air in the comedy world. Just as comedies were getting a bit stale (in my opinion) finally something comes along to really make me laugh. if you haven't seen it you should.
3,It was ok for a afternoon quickie...,"Interestingly, there was no chemistry between any of the actors in the movie. NONE at all! This was kinda funny in and of itself! It was ok, not the funniest thing I've ever seen. Just ok. Sometimes, that's good enough!Lisa G"
3,Maybe this was funnier in the theater?,"i laughed out loud once, chuckled a few times, but was bored most of the time."
5,Highly Therapeutic!,"With 525+ reviews already written, there's not much to say (well maybe there is) but a theme that resides in the film that is refreshing and therapeutic, is that humans are very imperfect beings, despite the race for the perfect technology, which, since it is thought of and devised by humans, makes it by definition imperfect technology if not just plain foolish. This film isn't afraid to show humans as the fools they are, or as Shakespeare stated, 'What fools these mortals be.'"
5,Funniest movie in 10 years.,My face hurt the next day after watching this movie from laughing so hard.- no kidding. This is the funniest movie in the last 10 years. the editing was done well & the script also. Most of the story goes backwards with the guys trying to figure out what happened last night. I hope the sequel is as good as the the first one.
5,Hysterical!,"I generally don't like slapstick comedies, but this one is the exception. If you don't laugh hysterically while watching, you have no sense of humor."
2,Over-rated to the extreme,"My freshman year in high school was almost over when this movie came out. EVERYONE was talking about it, there wasn't a day when my peers didn't bring up a qoute or reference about this movie. So since every person was saying this was an amazing film I thought I had to watch it. My mom bought the dvd and about almost 30 minutes into the movie I only laughed once. This is a type of movie where your type of sense humor is key. If you're not into unrealistic, immature, strange, perverted events occuring 24/7 then this is not for you. I stopped watching it because I got bored.Maybe if the movie wasn't trying so hard to appeal to my age group with it's lewd and immature humor then maybe I wouldn't hate it so much."
4,Funny!!,Very funny! Starting a collection of great comedies..so I had to include this one. I reserve a 5 for my most favorite movies
3,Two funny scenes,"People told me this was very funny. For me, not so much. Clever, maybe. Two funniest scenes: Cops questioning the main characters; the wedding singer."
4,good movie and ok blu ray,good movie in a bland blu ray but I guess you get what you pay for. Are they really saving money and plastic buy having that recycle symbol in there.
4,its the movie,"if you liked the movie and want the blu ray, here it is. some entertaining extras are contained. i liked."
3,"So, so movie","We rented this to see what Bradley Cooper has done before ""Silver Linings Playbook"". Let's just say he's come a long, long way. This juvenile attempt at humor wasn't even that funny at times."
3,The Hangover,I paid extra for supposedly because it had exclusive scenes and is my sons favorite movie -but he watched it and said there was no difference and that this version left out some really great scenes from the regular movie - so mistake on my part I guess - should have saved some money and just ordered regular version.
5,Great,I am very happy with the quality of the product. It was delivered within a few days of ordering too.
5,Great movie,This was a great movie. It was shipped to me when I was told it was going to be shipped. I was worried because it was the day before Christmas. But I got it and we watch it and it was fabulously funny. I still wanna know what's up with the chicken.
3,Entertaining but for ADULTS only . . ..,"I'm not sure how a couple of scenes in this flick made it past the sensors . . . even I thought a couple of the sex scenes were off colour and of bad taste (without a X rating).However, even the stuff in bad taste followed plot, IMO, and the script was funny with passable performances by the cast. The script was also original although I thought that it may be a bad remake of ""Bad Things,"" which it turned out not to be.Overall, I would recommend this to most anyone . . . except, and this is a big exception, for those who would object to extremely off colour and potentially offensive sexual content. The language is actually not that bad . . . although there is a fair amount of four letter words . . . but nothing close to some of the gratuitous cursing in some films.Have fun."
1,Infantile,"This movie illustrates the great divide in American movie-goer taste. A movie such as Seven Pounds (Will Smith) is mostly either loved or hated. I thought Seven Pounds was a great movie. I thought Hangover was stupid, infantile, produced for the below average junior high school boy."
1,The Hangover was a frickin joke!!!!!!!!,"The only reason why I even watched this movie was because a friend of mine annoyed the crap out of me until I saw it. This movie to me clearly did NOT live up to its hype. I did not laugh at all, the script for the movie was awful (half the script was the f-bomb). I find it to be unoriginal, boring, and predictable and very cliche. Do not waste your time or money on this movie."
5,The Hangover,The person that sold me this item was professional. The item arrived on time in excellent condition as they promised and I would definitely buy from them again.
2,"Overrated, overhyped - and ultimately fails to deliver.","This certainly isn't the comedy messiah and the savior of anarchistic comedy people claim it to be. What I found was, yes, a pretty formulaic (it's funny how people perceive the same film differently) and average (read: moronic) American comedy.The premise for wackiness to ensue is a good one, but it has been done better in movies such as Very Bad Things (which, granted, is a different type of film).In addition to a few funny lines and one-liners I felt the funniest (best) part was Galifianakis' Polaroid sequence - and that was during the end credits! Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a good modern comedy as anyone, such as Superbad - but a movie like Superbad has one crucial difference: a fantastic script. Despite the delicious premise, The Hangover only has a very average one and ultimately fails to deliver.One special mention for the worst play-it-safe soundtrack in recent memory. Usher's ""Yeah"", ""Who Let The Dogs Out""...seriously?"
2,"Preposterous, stupid ... not funny","What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.I wish this movie had stayed in Vegas.Save 90 minutes of your life by doing something else.This story of a Vegas trip/bachelor party escape gone awry starts out promising, but spirals into unbelievable realms.Just watching it may give YOU a ""bad movie"" hangover ..."
1,Poor sound quality!,"I purchased this DVD because it's one of my favorite movies, threw away the receipt, wanted to watch the move a week late and guess what - sound quality was so poor I had to increase the volume to the highest and still could barely hear anything! Now this DVD is also in garbage and I purchased another one from Best Buy. I guess you get what you pay for! :((("
1,Not that funny,"After all the good reviews, I was expecting this to be an entertaining and funny movie. It was a real disappointment - way over-rated. There were a couple of funny lines (too few and far between), but overall I would say its not worth the time or the $2.99 rental fee. Its not that I dislike ""over the edge"" humor (I liked Borat enough to buy it). The real problem with this film is that its just not that funny. Don't waste your time."
2,Dude! This film is for you.,"If you're a frat boy or wannabe, then this film was made with you in mind. My husband and I got a free copy of it with a film-by-mail subscription. I was looking forward to watching it, since I love stupid comedies like Airplane, Police Academy, and Naked Gun. We tucked into it with some beer and Indian takeout. First, I need to tell you that if your IQ is over 90, you are going to need to be drunk and/or high to make it through this. It's immature without being fun and... god. It just reminds me of some of the bad writing the boys used to do in high school English class, trying too hard to be cool; not witty, and not original. All of the women in it are bad stereotypes and did I mention it's not very funny? I feel like a grumpy old lady, but just Blues Brothers or something instead."
1,Do not recommend it to anybody,"The movie tells you that to be happy you must have bad relationships, use heavy drugs to do things that you will not remember next day and being irresponsible is a nice way of life. Unfortunately that is what the American movies are exporting to the entire world now. I do not recommend it to anyone. Freedom of expression is not freedom to teach such things"
5,Excellent,"While I agree with many reviewers about the double dipping, it didn;t affect me because this was the first time I had purchased it. Great movie, interesting extra photo album/book, and great extra scenes on disc."
1,garbage,desperate unoriginal vulgar attempt at comedy if they would have zero stars i wouldhave picked zero. what a waste of time and resources making this film
3,Has More Cuss Words Than Laughs,"The Hangover is a comedy that is overrated, and only fitfully funny. It amazes me that this has a 7.9 on imdb.com. I'm convinced that a lot of teenage boys rated it highly, thinking it is so cool to hear the ""f"" word said 100 times in an hour and a half. And I am no prude. I liked Scary Movie, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and most of the movies in the American Pie series. But all of those movies had just as many laughs as raunch. The Hangover is funny in spots, but it has more cuss words than laughs. Zach Galifianakis and Mike Tyson are the only actors who got big laughs from me."
2,Disappointed,"This DVD was advertised as a 2 disc package.When it arrived, it only contained 1 disc. I contacted Amazon, they sent a replacement and the replacement also only contained 1 disc. The packageindicated that the 2nd disc contained deleted scenes,outtakes,etc. I ended up sending my original purchase and the replacement back to Amazon."
5,excellent movie and excellent product.,As far as I am concerned this is the best movie of all time. Need a movie w/plenty of laughs. Watch this movie!
4,Better than Expected,"I expected this movie to be dirty. I thought it was going to be about men going to Vegas to watch strippers. But it actually turned out to be a funny movie. All of the dirty things they could have done in the movie were left out and reduced to a few not too bad photos at the end of the movie in the credits. It is just about a few guys being idiots. Allan is definitely the funniest guy in the movie. Without him, this movie wouldn't have happened. If you are hesitant about watching this movie, give it a shot. It's worth trying anyway."
3,the hangover,"maybe the hangover would have been better if i were drinking? the cast member lineup was good but not in these roles.i viewed it after a few drinks and 3 stars is all i can give,sorry."
4,GREAT MOVIE!,"I love this movie. The only reason why I gave this 4 stars is because I have a 55"" tv and it was all grainy... I know i should have bought the Blu Ray version but other DVDs are still clear on my tv."
5,Very happy with this purchase!,"I ordered The Hangover and it arrived in perfect condition, still in the plastic and in a good amount of time."
5,Beach Boys Anyone?,"This is a curious name for an individual singer-songwriter. Never mind that, it is gorgeous work that is worthy of popular acclaim! If someone had fooled me into believing that I was listening to the new Brian Wilson CD instead of Mull Historical Society, I might have fallen for it!!! This guy has much tallent, and songs like ""asylum"" are extremely catchy, and better than anything on the radio nowdays. Check this guy out, a keyboardist who can sing, and occasionally likes a 'wall of sound' surrounding the song."
1,IMPORTANT... READ THIS...,"This handbook contains only those Beanies released as of January 1999, and they DO NOT supply update pages, in spite of their claim that they do so. I have sent many faxes and e-mails to the publisher and have not gotten a single reply. (There is no phone number listed in the book so I can't call them.)"
1,Refried beans for the Beenie Baby Binder,It wasn't at all what I expected. I wouldn't recommend spending the money...I've seen better books on the subject in my local bookstores.
5,This book was wonderful,I really enjoyed this book. I found it at the store and just had to have it. It had all the information I needed to know about my beanies. It also has wonderful pictures of all the beanies they ever made which is wonderful to have. I really enjoyed this book. Thanks.......
5,My Beanie Baby Binder,"I love my book but updates have stopped. I wish updates could be started again. I would recommend that the available books be purchased. The last update was Summer of 1999.I am having trouble finding updates. If any one knows how to get up dates, please e-mail me."
2,Would be a 4* if it had ongoing updates!,"The book is wonderful but stops in the middle of no where. The last update recieved was Summer of 1999. Alot has happened since then & the new pages would be wonderful. One of the reasons for paying the price for the book was it would never go out of date. Especially seeing the material provided was clear, concise & covered all a collector could want! Please,Please go back to printing & selling the updates! Great Book (as far as it goes)"
5,Binder owner with Questions,"I just recently dusted off my binder and tried to go to the website listed on the back. No site found. I searched for the binder on Amazon and found that the updates have been disc. I'm so disappointed because I thought it was best one offered for collectors. FYI, the last binder published was a Final Millennial Edition that includes a 12/31/99 Retired section. The one I have is signed by Peg, also. If anyone knows why the updates never happened, please respond."
5,album,"Cd in mint condition very special ,magical , peaceful great for easy listening at night to calm down nerves. really lucky i found it so cheap. Thank YOU:)"
5,My name is David Munger too,"Hi, my name is David Munger. I *did* write this book! I like it, but of course, I'm biased"
2,Good Idea ... bad execution,"This book was a great idea in concept but it lacks in in execution. It suffers from poor editing. The examples often lack some critical piece that would make it very difficult for a beginner to complete the excercises and have working examples.Either the technical editor was sloppy or the proof reader/editor was a non technical person and so could not properly evaluate the logic of what was being written.There is a published errors page on the publishers web site however the sheet only covers the first few chapters.Its very frustrating when you are trying to learn something and the samples don't work and since you are learning you dont' know why?I would NOT depend on this book as the only study guide for the exams.There is a cd ,which comes with test questions, which is helpful however I'm not sure having taken one of the exams in question that the test questions prepare you for the level of difficulty of the actual exams.Good Luck!!!"
4,Great Book,"At a time when I had no Dotnet experience but was experienced programming, and there weren't classes that I could take, I got this book and it moved me in the right direction for self-training that got me the knowledge so that I could get a job."
4,"Helpful but not ""the only thing you will need""","I thought this book really helped me pass 70-305. However, it will probably not be sufficient if you are just beginning with the material or if you are using it as your sole resource. I used it with Self Test Software and I did not have any trouble with the exam. Also, as some of the other reviewers mentioned there are a few mistakes in the book especially with the chapter review questions. However, I still plan to use it to pass 306 and 310. Overall I would give this book a 7 out of 10."
5,Great gift for a creative child...,"I got this for my grandchild and she loves it. She was already doing some origami before this, but this made it so easy for her to be creative and everything she needs is included."
4,My Niece Loved it!,"This was a present for my 9-year-old niece. she loved it and made an adorable little frog right away. There are a good mix of easy, medium, and hard patterns, and there are a lot of fun papers. It's a great beginners set for a kid who is old enough to be able to follow the instructions -- I would say it's most appropriate for 7-11 year olds. Might be too frustrating for those under 7 and not challenging enough for those over 11 (although I must admit that one of the patterns had me so confused -- at 27 -- but my niece figured it out, so it was all ok). I wish there were more of the decorating pieces (the feathers, beads, etc -- there are only a handful), but overall, pretty happy with everything."
4,Kid's out of my hair.,"Kids had fun for hours. The only bad thing is running out of materials that come withtthe kit. I did not try to find replacements, but it taught the kids to improvise by making the materials."
2,Child frustrated,I gave to my nine year old for Christmas. This was her first experience with origami and she became frustrated almost immediately. I am ordering the paperback easy origami hoping she will find the designs less difficult.
4,Fun for kids with the attention span,"Even though my granddaughter is only six, she loved this kit. She is very good with her hands and I was able to show her how to do some of the designs. Some adult supervision is needed with children of this age, but the kit is flexible enough with all its little decorations and feathers that children can use their imagination to make their own creations without having to follow the rules step by step."
2,"Great supplies, no ""book.""","The art supplies in the kit are lovely. Disappointed that the instruction ""book"" is mearly pages of folded paper. Would of liked something more durable. (Note: the picture you see is not the book cover but the cover of the box the kit comes in.)"
4,Can get this cheaper,"This is a nice product, after I put it in my wish list for my daughter, I actually saw it for $5.00 at the store FIVE BELOW, so I got it there."
4,Very pleased with this Kit.,"This was purchased as a Birthday gift for my son, who loves Origami. My Son was crazy in love with the set and made nearly every origami in the book. He already knew quite a few of the folds but he found each of folds easy to understand and to actually make.I think this is a great toy that encourages Hand and Eye motor coordination, Imaginative play, and is great for children of all ages. A great Birthday Gift Idea!"
2,Boy Soldier/Traitor,"They are the same books under different names (and I bought both!). It is obvious that Mcnab did not really 'write' this one as there are some obvious mistakes such as describing an MP5 as an 'automatic machine gun', which irritates the hell out of me. One does not find the usual high quality material that is associated with the 'Nick Stone' series. Most of the SAS MO is old had have been seen elsewhere. The plot is somwwhat anemic and it appears that Danny manages to screw up just so that there is some shooting. I am personally quite dissapointed with this new series."
3,Helpful for exactly what it is intended for...,"I wouldn't say that I read the book cover to cover, but for a class textbook in graduate school, I think it was very helpful for its intended purpose. I used it where I need it (where I needed brushing up in certain areas of statistics especially) - and I think this book is a good reference book. The indexes are great, and the workbook actually does a good job of clarifying certain aspects of research that I was unceratin on."
4,A Good Book for Beginning Researcher,This is a good book for beginning researcher. It explains difficult concepts with simple to understand words. There are also samples that are very good guide for proposal writing.
3,"Good content, but poor presentation","I'm a master's student right now, so I've been through my fair share of textbooks. However, this has got to be one of the most boring textbooks I have ever come across. Granted, you may be thinking, ""what textbook isn't?,"" but this book is something else. While the content is fantastic (a great resource for those preparing for real research), the presentation is terrible. The book explains every tiny little detail, and by so doing, the reader finds him or herself inundated with unneeded, incredibly obvious information. If you were to remove the content intuitive to any college student, the book would be half as long and a much more interesting read. The comics included are ridiculously corny as well."
2,Deceptive advertising,"When I received this book I noticed it was sent from Thailand. On the cover it has a disclaimer that reads, ""International Version. Not for use by students in the United States."" I contacted seller and was assured that it was the same book. My classes started right away so I couldn't send it back for lack of time. It is the newest edition and other students in my class are using older one..I am just hoping it is the same. Paper pages seem really cheap...pirated copy?"
3,Required Text,"This was a required text for a Graduate class and I can't really say much more than that. The price on amazon.com was the best around, so if you need the text I suspect amazon will have the best price."
1,misleading!! for international use only! Not for USA.,There is no picture of the text because on the front it says it's the international student version for use outside the US. Very misleading information on the site.
2,sooo slow,I ordered the books and received notice 4 days later they were shipped. Checked the tracking link and verified they were in Dalas received them 7 days after they arrived in Dalas. I could have driven to Dalas in 2 hours. Piss poor
5,DVD and Depeche Mode a beautiful Combination,"Can we say hours of fun? Obsessive fun. The kind of fun which brings one hours of entertainment?Anton Corbijn directed this concert magnificently. I revisted the Exiter tour 3 times within my area, and this DVD made me feel like I was right there again.Depeche Mode always known for their charismatic stage presence (Dave Gahan and Martin Gore specifically) really shines through in this DVD. With lovely camera angles and glorious music, it makes the eye candy shine all the better.5 stars, I'd give it more but this DVD is the reason Amazon limits you in stars."
2,Below expectations,"The tracks on the box do not match the ones on the DVD. The sound is extremely bad for most of it. I wanted to feel like if I was at the show one more time. I made a huge mistake. Two stars for the picture quality and of course, Dave's performance."
2,I wish I could return this DVD,"I am a big fan of DM and saw this tour in Toronto, Canada. But on this DVD, Dave looked SOOOOOO exhausted and sounded REALLY bad! I can't believe it. The DVD is a huge disappointment. Though the picture quality is good, the sound is very bad. When I saw them live in Toronto, I still remember how much the crowd was into it and how much better Dave sounded. But in this one, everything looks forced and boring! I wish I could return this DVD!"
1,Horrid!!!,"I really liked Depeche Mode. I bought almost all of their albums (give or take a couple) and have a few of their singles. One thing I admired about them was David Gahan's sublime voice. Here was finally a rock star who could sing on key and who had a generous vocal range. Songs like ""Enjoy the Silence"", ""Strangelove"", and ""Here is the House"" show a tremendous vocal talent, and the live 101 album showed how great Dave sounded live, whereas most other rock stars would likely sing in monotone. However, Dave's singing on this DVD is absolutely horrid. He is most of the time OFF KEY and he strains the vocals too much, even on delicate songs like ""Waiting for the Night"". I can't even listen to an entire song on this DVD in its entirety. It's really that bad. I say this sadly, as I was hoping for a great live performance as in 101. I guess the years have finally taken their toll on David, unfortuneatly..."
5,Absolutely amazing,"This concert is fantastic, a lot better than 101. At the first time you can feel a little bit of weakness that soon dissapear and the force of Gahan doing great performance make of this a great show. The photography of Corbijn is 5 stars, absolutely great. The connection with the crowd is pretty nice too. The drummer makes the sound grow in a lot of songs, the only pity is that additional musicians are not focused too much.You wont ge dissapointed!!"
3,Is this really how Depeche Mode sound live??,"Let me start by saying Depeche Mode are absolutely one of my favorate bands & have been for a good 15 years. I have almost all of their CD's & love most of them but, I never had the chance to ever see them live. I picked this concert DVD due to such great reviews on here. I must admit I was pretty disapointed in watching/listening to this DVD. Dave Gahan's singing was like listening to nails on a chalkboard at times & very pitchy. The music/audio just didn't seem to mesh well. Martin Gore just seemed to stand in one place at all times, often with his back to the audience as if he didn't want to be there & they really didn't show to much of the other band members. The song list was wonderful, all my personal favorates. I tried to give it another go & watch it again, but got bored halfway through the DVD & shut it off again. I'm going to buy a different one of their DVD's & hope this one was just kind of a ""stinker""."
4,The best DM live DVD,"This is far and away the best DM live DVD. the video direction is just amazing and each song has a very different and climatic mood to it.The only thing i woudl have liked to see done better is the slection of songs. There is only 1 song from music for the masses and 2 from black celebration. I really would have liked to see them take some ultra songs out and play songs from those albums.All in all though, an excellent dvd. dont pass this one up."
