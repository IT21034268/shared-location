1,This sucks!,"We were very excited by this toy -- or at least, by the idea of the toy. We have friends who bought a similar product from a different company and they love theirs. But when we got ours in the mail and set it up on the frig... it didn't work. No matter what letter we put into the box, the machine said 'E' the sound this letter makes is 'E'. Worse than useless.... Downright waste of money and brain power. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!"
2,?,"I ordered this toy and for some reason it was never delivered to me, but Amazon claimed I returned it saying I didn't want it....I am not sure what happened, but I was very disappointed with the situation. Amazon corrected the mistake so I hope all is well."
2,glad it got lost,very hard to understand. so loud in the morning when you are trying to get kids ready and no one is listening
3,Just Okay.,"This item is a great idea, but I'm not sure that it was well executed. It works great, has held up real well, and my daughter has fun playing with it on the fridge. The downside is: some of the letters are strange to the ear. The annunciation isn't exactly right and I've found that it has confused my daughter a little. Most are correct, but just a few are a little strange."
5,Very fun,My son got this for his birthday and he loves the song it sings with the letter sounds. I like that it has some educational effect. :)
2,Toy is great; LeapFrog support is not. Check your product immediately after purchase.,"I'm being stingy with my stars for the review of this toy, not because it is a poor toy - it's not. My daughter loves it and plays with it often and, having just turned 2, loves singing along with the tunes.My problem is that our fridge phonics did not have all 26 letters; they had 2 G's and no S. My 4-year-old is bummed that he can't spell his name. But when I contacted LeapFrog support, their reply was ""sorry, you'll have to return the whole thing, with the receipt, to the location at which it was purchased."" Well, it was a gift, purchased in another state, so that's not possible, and it's galling that we can't just get a replacement S. I've had excellent luck with LeapFrog in the past, but this is really disappointing."
3,It's ok...,"The kids get bored with it because it's the same tune for each letter. I think the word-making option would be better, but I don't have that one so can't really say. We do have the farm animal fridge game and the kids always liked that one--more variety."
5,The best fridge letter magnets you can get!,"we received this as a gift for my 20 month old. She loves it! She stands at the fridge and puts the letters in and dances to the ABC song. When she pushes the letter it sings a catchy little song about the sounds that letter makes. She actually knows the sounds of several letters now. It's sturdy too. She's banged it several times and, surprisingly, it still works. I plan on making this one of my standard gifts to young toddlers."
5,WE love it!!,"I have a 7, 5 and 1 year old and our youngest got this for Christmas and they all play with it! Not to mention the 1 and 5 year old that I babysit! It is the greatest for her to learn her ABC and sounds and not to mention a great entertainer while I'm in the kitchen trying to get meals prepared! I know of 4 kids that got this for Christmas and one more that I'm gonna get it for for a birthday gift! I love Leap Frogs products and ideas! Another favorite that my one year old got was the Leap Frog Phonics Radio and they all can use it also to sharpend their schools even the 7 year old! I would highly recommend spending the money on these two items!"
5,A Leap Frog Fan!,"I got this toy as a gift for my 2 year old, but my 3 and 5 year old are learning a ton from it! It uses the same songs as the video, ""The Letter Factory"", so the kids know the songs and sing right along with them! My 3 year old knows ALL the sounds of ALL the letters already! It is quite amazing, plus it keeps little ones entertained while I am working in the kitchen. Can't beat the value of this toy!"
4,Keep it coming Froggiee,My 2 year old loves it. Just like some of their other great products Leapfrog delivers!!!
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"I bought this when my daughter was about 15 months old. Now, at the ripe old age of 19 months, she knows at least 75% of her letters. She amazes me daily as she points to letters on shirts, magazines etc. and tells me what letter it is. She had a little trouble in the beginning figuring out how each letter needed to be oriented to fit in the base, but after a few days she got the hang of it pretty well. She is now working on learning what sounds each letter makes. I like that it is very durable, since she has sent if flying across the room several times. I feel very confident that this product will really help in her ability to learn to read at a young age. An excellent buy!!"
5,Great Educational Toy,I bought this for my daughter for her 2nd birthday. She plays with it all the time. It has really helped her learn her alphabet and how the letters are pronounced.
4,My 3 yr old nephew loved it!,"I hear he loves it and it gets him making his sounds, which is important."
1,My child will be illiterate!!!!,"The letters are all wrong!!!! For instance, it keeps telling my boy that a 'T' is a 'W'. I'm wossing iw in whe wrash."
1,Teaching wrong letters,"I bought one of these for my two year old son thinking that it would be a great learning toy. He had about a week before I noticed that some of the letters were saying they were another letter. I wrapped it back up, brought it to the store for an exchange and when I got home and opened the second one the same thing happened. Out of the 11 letters I tried only 4 gave the correct letter. I do not recommened this toy for anyone and if you do make sure that you check all of the letters before letting your child play and be taught the wrong alphabet!"
3,Many Small Pieces - Still undecided,"My son got this for Christmas when he was 20 months old. He has the barnyard and really likes it but this one I'm still not sure about. He never uses the doghouse to put the letters in, or the refrigerator to put the letters on. We try to keep all the letters together (even though we are missing a few already)in a big plastic pickle jar. (If I were Leapfrog, I would sell this toy with a small container that could store it all together.) My son loves to carry the jug around and shake it and open and close it. He likes to dump them all out and then put them back in the jar. When I'm playing with him, we say the names of the letters and spell out simple words, but I don't know that he's actually learning anything when we're not playing together and he's scattering the pieces all over the house."
3,Great but someone should check them before they ship!!!!,"I like the toy and it works well. However, I didn't notice until I was putting the letters out for my granddaughter that there are two R's and no P. That makes putting the alphabet on the fridge a little difficult and its hard to spell words: as you can see I used the letter P a few times in this paragraph."
4,Durable toy,This toy has been knocked off the fridge or thrown to the floor more times then I can count and it keeps working. It has a catchy tune that I don't think is too annoying. Child can see the letter and hear the sound it makes at the same time. The pieces are always scattered all over my kitchen floor though! I guess you can't blame that on the toy though!
2,played letters incorrectly,"My 2 year old immediately starting playing with this set and has continued to do so over the next 4 months. The problem is that at least half of the letters played the incorrect sound. For example a ""C"" would say it was a ""K"" etc. I hid all the letters that played incorrectly."
2,Didn't get the one we wanted,"Unfortunately we didn't get the ""sunshine"" one we wanted, the one we put on the wish list. My son is scared of dogs and the barking makes him upset. Wish we would have received the one pictured on Amazon!"
1,Great Toy - Comparison Shop on Prices,My child loves this toy. My advice is to comparison shop. This particular retailer is more than double other retailers.
2,Wow - doesn't anyone else find this toy annoying?,"I bought this for my kids and after an hour I couldn't take the noise this toy makes any longer! I feel that Fisher Price makes better toys that make more tolerable sounds - this toy has an annoying voice and song. I think the best method for learning the alphabet is sitting down and learning wit an actual person, not a loud, annoying toy. I am going to concentrate on buying wooden toys from this point on."
2,Test in the store before you buy!!!!!!!!,"I bought this after having several friends tell me that it was wonderful for their kids. I brought it home and opened it to find out that half the letters didn't work, and the ones that did work, made the wrong sound. ie. you put the ""C"" in and it says ""F says fffff"". I had to return it 4 times before I got one that worked properly.Now, since I JUST got one that worked, my daughter hasn't tried it. I have heard alot of good things about it so I will try it with her. Just be aware when you buy it that it might not work, and you might be teaching your child Leap Frog's new phonetical language!!"
1,DANGEROUS TO CHILDREN,"Too bad the lowest rating is 1 star, because it deserves no stars. One of every three letters was wrong. I wonder how many parents take the time to look at this learning toy. Do you want your child confusing 1/3 of the alphabet? When my son put the X into the thing, it said, ""T"". I was alarmed, so I put each of the letters in, finding a whopping 9 pieces that were wrong! I repeated the test with the same results. There are fresh batteries in the toy too. I'm appalled that this item is not recalled."
2,Uppercase Letters,"I guess I should have looked closer at all of the pictures, including the ones at the bottom of the description. I just saw the ones at the top in the main list of pictures and saw the lowercase letters. That's the whole reason I ordered it. The one I got is all uppercase. I guess that's what mean by ""styles may vary""? Teaching uppercase letters only, or primarily, can cause serious reading delays and issues. Most letters in reading and writing are lowercase and lowercase letters should be the focus for teaching letters initially. Going to see if another store has this with the lowercase version that I can exchange, or I'll have to send it back to Amazon. Bummed."
1,Broken in 30 minutes,"We received this as an Easter gift, and it stopped working in 30 minutes after my toddler accidentally dropped it on the floor from 1.5 feet off the refridgerator. We called Leapfrog to see if they would replace it, but they would not due to the possibility of ""abuse"" on the toy. Well, anyone that has a toddler knows that they are not gentle with toys, so if the craftmenship is inadequate, the toy will break. We will not buy from Leapfrog in the future."
5,Satisfied,"My son's special needs teacher recommended this, and we love it. My son sings the letters and has made great progress. I am glad I bought it."
5,Very Cute!,"My daughter got this for Christmas at 18-months-old. It was a hit for sure! She loves to play the song on it and dance. She hasn't explored the letter sounds as much as I'd like yet, but I wager that it will come in time. She's still young and she just likes to have fun. :)"
5,very happy,My 2 year old really likes this toy.I like it b/c when im trying to cook or do dishes in the kitchen instead of trying to get my attention she will start to play with this toy.
5,Wonderful!,"I bought this for my granddaughter, whom I do not get to see very ofter. She is 20 months old. After three short days, we could here her starting to sing the alphabet. She kept going back to the fridge to play. I would highly recommend this product."
3,Some letters are enunciated poorly (poor sound),"We purchased this for our Daughter after seeing similar items. It works and she has been entertained by it however, I would not get this if you are looking to help your child learn their letter sounds - a number of the letter names and sounds are difficult to pick out. Unless corrected, your child could end up thinking that A and E have the same name and make the same sounds. Perhaps the manufacturer will pick some new audio samples for a future revision. Apart from that, the thing gets a bit annoying for grown-ups before long.That aside, it does also double as a decent set of alphabet refrigerator magnets which our daughter plays with."
1,Product is defective,"I purchased this for my granddaughter. When she started playing with it, I quickly discovered about 10 of the letters played the wrong sound, for example, if you put the ""A"" in, it says the letter ""C"". I am returning this product as I think this will be very confusing to a toddler trying to learn the alphabet."
4,good for reinforcing letters,"I purchased this for my 4 year old that has been resistant to learning letters. He was playing with it this morning and enjoying searching for letters. I only wish that they had added some additional language to each letter. For example, instead of just saying ""a"" and the ""ahh"" sound, it would have been helpful to say ""apple"", etc.Other than that I think it is good, probably even better for slightly younger children."
4,Great toy to keep in kitchen!,"This keeps my toddler occupied while I fix dinner constantly. She even teeths on them, and they show no signs of damage!!"
5,Most played with toy,"Both of my children have learned alphabet, sounds, and letter recognition using this toy. It is the most played with item in our home."
5,She loves it!!!,"AUGUST 7TH 2005--I bought this for my God daughter back in March and she loves it! She's a little over two now and learns frequently! (upDATE) I bought this two more times for christmas 2006! I find that I love the songs just as much as the kids do. It's a catchy tune. Easy for them to learn and fun, and easy to switch the letters around. These toys don't have to be put on the fridge! They work on any magnetic surface. Like the back of a door or a deep freezer it doesn't really matter as long as it gets the job done!"
4,perfect learning tool,"My 17 month old son absolutly loved this at a recent get together with a friend, so of course I ordered it right away and have not been at all disappointed. He loves learning his letters and sounds and is already starting to sing his A,B,C'sNow whenever he sees his books or anything with words he likes to try to spell , not that he can yet but hey- at least he's interested!! I love this and would recommend it to anyone."
5,Great toy with numbers too!,Ours worked great and the NEW version DOES have numbers like the previous reviewer said (check Walmart's site and many others because Target still sells the older version). If you buy one with problems it's worth trying again.
4,Wonderful Toy for a youngin!,"My Son LOVED this. Why Loved? Well, it broke fairly quickly... he used it tons and tons and tons! We got it for him at about 12 months and he killed it about 3 months later (maybe a little longer). We then bought the 3 letter one instead and that died on us about a month ago. I am Leary to buy another BUT we have TONS of leapfrog products that have been used for years! So I dont know what's wrong with these 2.. but they are excellent and he LOVES them! He is VERY good with his letters at 20 months old and I think Leapfrog helped!"
3,Could be better,"I bought this for my 2 year old son. It does an OK job of pronouncing the letters, but doesn't have any examples for the letters. It just repeats B says ""Bu"", B says ""Bu"" every letter makes a sound and B says ""Bu"". It would be nice for it to say B says ""boy"" or a word that starts with it. In addition, about 8 of my letters don't work, I even tried replacing the batteries and the same letters don't work."
4,Great for teaching letter sounds,"My daughter got this as a Christmas gift when she was 16 months old. Three months later, she can identify several letters and their sounds on a consistent basis. The only critique I have of this toy is that the volume switch is right on the front, so she's constantly turning it up to the loudest setting. Otherwise, it's a great toy for getting kids familiar with the alphabet."
4,Very good use for the frig.,This toy is a very good item to buy for kids. It helped my little girl start her ABCs because she loves to play with all the magnett letters. Good if your kid stays in the kitchen with you while you cook or clean. Keeps them busy for awhile.
4,Grade A Toy !!!,My daughter is 19 months and have a son that is 8 years old.They both love this toy!! It's very easy to use and teaches motor skills along with hand eye coordination. You have to put the blocks in a certain way for them to play..or should I say turn them the right way. The song is simple and the same for all letters so it's easy to learn all letters by just changing the sound of each different letter. The ABC song is very easy as well for young ones to learn. They do get a little messy and spread quickly through the house...but hey so would the plastic magnetic letters and number you buy for $5 bucks. This is a much better value for the lessons taught to little ones. Oh and it has volume control...all parents love volume control!!
5,My 22-month old knows his letters,"Thanks to this toy (and really very little extra motivation by me and my husband), my 22-month old son has learned all his letters. He was quite obsessed with it even before he could really put the letters in the base that plays the sounds. He just loved to push the button and hear the alphabet song (which he also can sing now). The only problem is that he early on lost two letters and (as far as I know) you can't buy individual replacements. We are definitely going to get the expansion set of lower-case letters! He has also learned the phonics for many of the letters and will have a great head-start on reading."
5,Excellent Purchase,"I bought this toy years ago for my 14 month old boy to get a jump start on recognizing letters. I displayed it on the refridgerator and he loved and played with it immediately. It has a great jingle for every letter and is quite mesmorizing...I would catch myself singing it driving to work! After just a few months, he could recognize all 26 letters of the alphabet and their sounds with absolutely no help from me. He was the only child in his entire daycare center that knew every letter and their sounds before he was 2 years old. The teacher raved about how smart he was...all because of this toy! My son is now 5 years old and stopped playing with it a couple years ago. However, I strongly feel that it had a big influence in him being an early reader and writer. It truly made learning fun and I didn't have to do any of the work!"
5,Excellent Quality and Super Fun - A great purchase,"I got this on sale and it's great. The quality of the magnets on each letter prevent lost letters all over the house, not the case with the original fridge letter sets. The little song sung with each letter is clear and promotes singing along and memory, and the alphabet song is great too. This is a great set, you won't be dissapointed. My daughter has been learning letters very fast thanks to this toy.P.S. Watch to make sure you unpack *all* the letters when you open the box, I forgot a couple and had to dig them out of the garbage when I realized some were missing!"
4,Great,I bought this toy for my son's 3rd birthday and only after 2 months he now sings the alphabet song all the time. It is a great education toy and also very durable. My son has droped it on the kitchen floor a lot is it still works like new.
5,Outstanding Toy - Fun and Educational!,"We love this toy! My daughter (now 21 months old) has had this toy for six months and still loves to play with it. It is convenient to keep on the fridge where she can reach it. She can easily plug the letters into the slot and push them to hear their names and sounds. She also likes to push the button to hear the entire alphabet song. The letters are in big bright colors. I especially like the fact that they are magnetic, but the backs are smooth, so there are no little magnet bits that might come off and be hazardous."
4,Beats that don't blunt,"Never the most original, Tommy Guerrero ploughs confidently through lots of blissed out Hip Hop beats. Or so you thought until you reach `Mechanisms' when he and his collaborator go Beloved. The delicious back beat has strings for company and like sun light breaking through your curtains at dawn, John Gold sings, ""here comes the silence"". `Jusdis Boy' is another sublime awakening of a track. However, `RF Interference' is the pinnacle. A loungy latin love affait that twirls you around the dancefloor of your mind. This album is more than a beats and blunts affair."
4,Psykillogy,"Everything that is written in this review is strictly under the influence of the song, 2 days Later. Its my fav favorite song on this album. I like the intelligent nightlife lounge atmosphere created in the song, the album is pretty solid, along with Medeski Martin and Wood type sound, i think. If you like advanced Cultured music, this is only the beginning. You like my analysis of music? well let me know, because music will evolve into a global language, as mathematics has. ( :"
1,A Quick Moneymaker,"Tommy Guerrero is a good musician, of that I have no doubt. His minimalist lounge affair ""A Little Bit of Somethin'"" done on his home 4-track as I understand was blissful and original. It was basically him and his guitar with a dimensional layering and the intricate melodies were hypnotizing. Don't mistake his other work with this. This is some trip-hop attempt at Acid Lounge. It is not creative or conceptual but very repetitive. It is dark and cold, but not in a good way. It is dark and cold like mold in the basement. The weakness of the breakbeats becomes quickly apparent as you scroll through the CD wishing you could jam to something but not quite finding it. This sounds like something my little brother made with his Acid computer program."
4,Even Germans like old time country music,"Looking for nice old time country music, we got this piece by a trip through the U.S. Not knowing, what kind the whole country music market offers to us, we found the Smoky Mountain Hits and enjoyed them very much. It is kind of heartfelt, amazing and happy music we love a lot. It helps us dreaming of our trips to and through the United States."
5,Heartwarming and magical,"I absolutely LOVED this book! Once I started it I couldn't put it down until I finished it. It has the perfect blend of spells, potions, romantic love, family love, humor, and mystery as Gilly comes to terms with her childhood memories. I did not want this wonderful story to end."
5,Thornyhold,"I received this book as a Christmas present when in elementary school, and I confess that it took a while for me to open it up. Once I read it, however, I had to read it again. And again. And again. Fifteen years later, I am still reading this touching tale. This novel is an excellent example of loving and being sure of oneself. The descriptions are beautiful but not overbearing, and the simple story touched with magic is engaging. I highly recommend this book to everyone."
3,"Dreamy book, but no real value","I am a big fan of Mary Stewart, and I bought this book ages ago after reading The Hollow Hills, etc. I came across it while going through old books destined for the library book sale, and it soon found it's way into the discard box. I expected much more than a dreamy, slow story about a woman who seems all-too-accepting of the random elements of magic in her life. The first half the book was almost uneccesary--slow and sad--and the second half reminded me of a cheap period romance.While I do believe this is fitting for readers looking for a relaxing, flowery experience, it is a very bad choice for those of us expecting something engaging and exicting."
2,Kinda boring. . .,"Let me start off by saying that I really enjoyed the writing style of this book. I felt like I was present and the setting was lovely. That being said, not much happened in this book. I hate to write a negative review...but this book lacked a plot...just too boring!"
2,slow starting,"This book was a bit disappointing - its a slow read, but it gets bettertowards the end."
4,This book is charming,This book is so charming....it makes me wish for a place like Thornyhold for myself. The main character is someone you can really come to care about and I have a feeling that I will be re-reading this one again and again.
4,This is one of my favorites!,"Mary Stewart wrote many exciting novels, but ""Thornyhold"" is my favorite. I love the idealic-country setting. The images of magic, dreams, and wildlife will entrance you. The only thing to say against it, is that the ending is dated from a feminist viewpoint. But...I just imagine my own ending as I read and reread this gem."
3,"Liked it, but could've been much better","This book was an enjoyable read, however I found the storyline to be lacking a bit and highly predictable. It was still a good read and I would recommend it, however, if you're expecting something thrilling and romantic this book is not for you. It's entertaining at most, but the ending was rushed, like the author had only ten minutes to pop out an ending. If she had taken her time to write a hearty ending, I would have given this book five stars."
1,"Great mats, Customer service needs a little bit improvement",I had a very bad experience with the customer service at WeatherTech. However I found the email ID of the CEO of WeatherTech and emailed him about how I was treated and how my order has been delayed and guess what he replied in 1 minute. He personally took care of my issue and got my item shipped over fast. I was really impressed. Inspite of it being the holidays he reponded to each and every email.The item fits like a glove. And I would certainly order from them again.
4,Nice Fit,"The cargo liner arrived in a couple of days, has a nice fit and looks good. Nothing bad to say about the experience."
5,great product,I bought this so my dog could stay in the back of the car and it is perfect. It is durable and in great condition even though I bough it used.
5,excellent fit,"Now that we have the correct cargo liner, check on the correct liner style number using the manufacturer site as Amazon Site may not have the correct style number. Fit is terrific, I expected no less since I had others from this same manufacturer, WEATHERTECH. Quality cannot be beat.Got on time as promised."
5,Great Fit - Great Service,I wanted something to protect the new Prius and this was ordered and delivered in no time. It fit as advertised - perfectly! I would definitely order from this vendor again.
5,Perfect fit for 2008 Prius,"This mat is a perfect fit for the cargo area of my 2008 Prius. It looks like the car came from the factory this way - and indeed it should have! While the listing says it is designed for the 2004 - 2007 Prius, rest assured it works perfectly in the 2008 as well."
1,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN HOW MAD I AM WITH THIS UNETHICAL, UNPROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE OF WEATHER TECH. THEY ARE JUST WORST KIND OF PEOPLE. I AM SURPRISED AMAZON STILL DOING BUSINESS WITH THEM."
1,Poor customer service,"Followed the WeatherTech website prompts to order ""superior fitting"" front floor mats for my 1979 Jeep CJ7. Not the rear mats that ""are designed to be trimmed,"" just the fronts. When the floor mats arrived, I find they are too long and do not fit. Customer service says send them back for a full refund minus shipping cost. Customer Service rep, Dereck says they will not cover return shipping because the mats are not vehicle specific. What? While the instructions say: ""Many of our front mat applications are vehicle specific, while others are determined to be the best possible fit for the application from our many shapes and sizes,"" everything on the order site refers specifically to a 1979 Jeep CJ7 with no mention that my Jeep is a ""best possible fit."" We own WeatherTechs for our Lexus, Honda and Subaru that fit superbly. While the 15 bucks for shipping is disappointing; it's the miss-representation to a long time customer that will send me elsewhere."
5,Fits like a glove,"This liner comes rolled up so let it sit overnight or it may be frustrating to see the corners curl up when you get it. It was good to remove the old one that slides around and is pretty useless.This fit the 2002 prius nicely. It also has notches for the straps in the corners of the trunk. I am a picky customer and there is not much missing from this product. The only downside is accessing the compartment below the liner but there is enough flex in the material to roll or force up without problems. Other Prius owners have asked where I got the trunk mat.I would get more products from this company because of the attention to detail and it is made in the USA. Minimal carbon footprint on shipping and support MacNeil Automotive, a domestic company."
3,Boot liner,Fitting was not good although the quality of the product was very good. In the end i bought a better fitting one from www.bootsliners.co.uk
5,WeatherTec Prius Cargo Mat,"The rubber mat fit my Prius very well and has protected the carpeting. The lip contains both spilled liquids and dirt. Thanks, Amazon!"
4,"Works very well, might be overpriced","First, the flimsy back deck of the Prius is a problem. Gentle use leads to scuffing. This product handles that while also keeping cargo from sliding around too badly. It fits perfectly as you'd expect. But.. over $100.00 plus shipping seems like about twice as much as it should cost. (just an opinion, mind you)"
1,weather tech is not the issue,"I did not even look at this product. I openned the packing slip and was disheartened with what was shipped to me. I ordered a chevrolet Equinox cargo tray and received a toyota cargo tray instead. If that wasn't bad eough, I have been calling the company (ALL TIME AUTO) in which I received the product from and have had to leave a message everytime. I have not received a call back despite my many efforts. I have also contacted Amazon via online site and have not had a response from them either. At this point my frustration is increasing and I hope that I will soon get this issue resolved. Sincerely, Mounting frustrationWeatherTech 40268 Black Rubber Cargo Liner"
1,Poorly designed radio travel alarm clock,"I bought this item elsewhere but disliked it so much I feel the need to warn others. Unfortunately I hadn't realized it had been reviewed here until it was too late.Much of the lcd display is taken up by a monthly calendar that is so small it is illegible.The actual time display is small. Even worse,there is no back or front light which makes this clock unreadable at night without turning on a lamp.Although there is a radio (which works as well and sounds as good as can be expected for something this cheap and small), you can not wake to music -- only to a choice of two alarms. These alarms are very shrill and so loud they'll wake not only everyone in your hotel room but also everyone in the room next door.I was going to return this item but by the time I paid for the shipping and the 20% restocking fee, I decided it would be better and cheaper to save it for a gift for someone I don't like."
1,Fifteen years in hell an autobiography,A very typical story of anyone who has a severe drinking problem but the era in which it takes place is interesting. The price (Free) was right!
4,Good battery but...,"I have received the battery but it is not like the one in the picture. However, it works fine so far."
5,My favorite Lucio Dalla CD!,This is the best example of his talent...both as a singer and as a songwriter. Rest in Peace Lucio. Your beautiful songs will live on forever...
5,YOU'N KNOW NANN,"TRICK BE REPRESENTING HOW LIFE REALLY IS IN THE MIA.PEOPLE THINK MIAMI IS ALL BOUT SOUTH BEACH. BUT I'M HEAR TO TELL YOU IT AINT. ONE TIME FOR CAROL CITY,TWO TIME FOR FLORIDA AND THREE TIME FOR THE DIRTY SOUTH.WE BE OFF THE CHAIN DOWN HEAR IN THE BOTTOM"
3,Not Thuggish Enough!,"There are three tracks on this CD worth listening to: tracks 4,5, and 7. Track 4, ""So What,"" is the hardest hitting track on the CD, and I was disappointed that there weren't more tracks with similar intensity. Track 5, ""Naan Nigga"" was nice with tight production but the male/female rap duet ended too abruptly and falls short of being as tight and witty as other male/female rap duets such as Ice Cube and Yo Yo or most recently Jay Z and Amil. The track needed another verse or two. Track 7, ""Hold On"" appears destined for radio play down South with its R&B flavored hook. The rest of the tracks on the CD are tolerable but not hard hitting enough- too many R&B singing hooks. With the exception of the tracks mentioned, the CD does not deliver the hardcore Miami bass sound and thuggish lyrics I was expecting from the CD's title. I'm also a first time Trick Daddy CD purcahser. 3 stars at best."
5,Trick Daddy And The lost tribe are off the chain!,"Hey whats up! Did yall check out the track ""so what"" on www.thug.com and ""boy"" on book of thugs. the members of The Lost Tribe are Fat, Mystic, and last but not least my boy Kase(hey baby if u reading this) they off the chain yo! But just be on the lookout for their cd to come out! And mine too as i am a singer! And also my girl Monika or better known as MOnsta the cutie the hottest female rapper in Detroit , but we bout to put Detroit on the map for real just stay up on this! jada"
5,OFF THE CHAIN BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"TRICK DADDY IS OFF THE CHAIN AND MOST OF ALL HE IS REPRESENTIN THE DIRTY SOUTH !!!!! THIS ALBUM IS SO TIGHT BECAUSE HE IS TALKING ABOUT EVERYDAY LIFE, IN WHICH MOST PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO."
2,www.thug.com,"This cd, much like most of Trick Daddy's cd's, is pathetic and boring. Non of this guys cd's are tight. Well, Book of Thugs, is the closes Trick Daddy has come to being a real rapper. The only tight song on this boring cd is #6. Don't buy this garbage. If Trick Daddy doesn't get a record that's worth buying, he may need to get a day job."
1,I REALLY WISH THAT...,"...this guy would learn how to sing or play an instrument! That goes for all the ""gangsta rap-stars."" I am very disappointed that Amazon.com does not have a zero star rating. I could have used it on this one."
3,O.K. BUT NOT THUGGISH.,"THE CD DIDN'T HAVE THAT MANY GOOD SONGS ON IT BUT ,THE TIGHTEST SONGS ARE 5,4,7 I THINK THE CD COULD HAVE HAD A BETTER OUTCOME."
5,This CD is RAAAAAAWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD got some tight-*ss lyrics and keeps my head bobbin' back and forth to these bomb-*ss beats! I swear dude, I finto get me this CD as soon as I hit the store up for it. Yall should check it out to, so yall can be pimpin' these tight verses."
1,Worst subscription customer sertvice,"Recently I subscribed TAS for two years but all I received was two issues when there are another 5 issues available now! I contacted them many times and the customer service apologized and told me that they send the issue right away, but another two months passed and I received nothing after same thing happened another time I asked for cancelation they did it without trying to find any solution!It seems that it happens a lot and they are used to it."
5,A great resource for entry level and high end gear.,Started a subscription when I was in the market for a new turntable about six years ago. This magazine along with Stereophile helped me make a great purchase. Love it!
3,Interesting,"This is an interesting magazine because while it often offers reviews for products that I could never afford, it does sometimes expose exotic products as worthless, and will even praise a very simple and inexpensive product over a more expensive one."
4,Fundamentals of Aircraft and Airship Design (Aiaa Education Series),"This is an updated edition of Nicolai's 1975 publication. I personally feel that it will equal Raymer's Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach (Aiaa Education Series), which is the current reigning collegiate aircraft design publication. The book is well written and even presents a section design propeller-driven aircraft. He has an extensive section on structural design and analysis. I am planning on adopting this book for our senior aircraft design course."
4,Airship Designers Beware!,"This book comes in two volumes. The book you see is Volume 1 which is devoted to Aircraft Design only. Airship Design is supposedly covered in Volume 2 which I have been unable to locate. The AIAA says it is unavailable. Does that mean it hasn't been published yet or just that they didn't have one to send me? If any of you find out, please let me know. Volume 1 is an excellent 900-page book with about 200 pages of appendices. Volume 2 promises several Case Studies which I am most interested in."
4,nothing to complain about...,"stronger than your average 'smooth jazz' cd... has a bit more 'soul' to it; mr. marcus aint afraid of a well placed beat which is what helps keep your attention when listening to some mellow sounds... (unless you just WANT something that's gonna put you to sleep!) ...as far as smooth jazz goes, this is 5 star disc, but since i'm a very picky person and stubborn (my friends will attest!), i can only give this a 4 overall because the weight of this cd is carried mostly upon the shoulders of 3 or 4 tracks and not as evenly as i would like...i miss alyson williams and wish she would return with an album or two... she coo's oh so very lovely on the one track given to her... and marcus's version of 'til the cops come knockin' is somehots#it!to the less critical fan, this is a must have. i hope yall enjoy it.take it easy now,sum."
5,Lots of FUN!!,"This is a lot of fun for kids or adults. The instructions are step by step and are clearly written. They're also augmented by line drawing of how to do the folds and where to cut. Pictures of finished books are also shown so you can see how it should turn out. There are pictures of kids making these crafts throughout the book which makes it kid friendly. There are also ideas on themes for the books so it's a little more than just about the mechanics of folding but also ideas on content. The gypsy wagon for example has little cards that you put into each of the folds so she has you write a story in the cards first - by the end you have a really cool folding book that is interactive and tells a story. As I mentioned, this is great for kids of all ages (like me at 36 years young). I'm planning on making some booklets to incorporate into altered books and journals."
3,I'm giving this to my nephew,"Unfortunately, the initial part of this book's title (Books for Kids to Make) isn't something amazon.com shows well so I was expecting something geared to a different audience. Something to 'accessorize' Cover-to-Cover (the supreme bookmaker's book!). This book does a good job of making the craft of book making accessible to children.....so I'll be sharing this with my artistic nephew instead. I could see this also as being useful to a teacher in the lower grades....but it doesn't discuss anything new and exciting for those already immersed in bookmaking."
2,Too young child oriented,I was expecting a variety of creative book ideas. But if projects for children is your thing it will work for you.
5,Lovely book - full of inspiration,"I love this book. It gives me a number of inspiring ideas that can be adapted for anybody's use. Simple, easy to use, good illustrations. Now if only I can find the time to make all the books I want to...."
2,Too slow,"Too many ""thoughts"" and over thinking. Seemed to drag on but had the possibility of a good story line. Everything seemed to be focused on her fears without notice to the real situations."
1,awful,These do not work one bit! I'm really disappointed that I spent money on two sets and they both are in returnable because of opened packaging and I can't use them... I only got the temperature to change when I put the light an inch from the damn thing.
1,worked like garbage,"Fluker's is a respected name, which is why i bought this. Though the hygrometer didn't work, at ALL. And the Temp gauge worked decently. Only gripe was the hygrometer, which is what i needed the most. Oh well."
4,Although in 80s...still Dramatics!,"This is a nice CD from one of the most famous R&B groups ever! My favourite song is 'One Love Ago', while the Medley is bringing back the best memories from their past hits! Enjoy!"
4,great,"this is a nice product, suits my skin and i am very happy to buy it easily online for a nice price..."
5,EndWorld Series - Blade,"A must read book for all action fans. Fast paced with plenty of action and likeable characters. Set after WW3, when the world is still rebuilding itself. But there's not just humans to deal with - there are mutants and other races of beings, all vying for supremacy. It's a dog eat dog world and Blade and his team of warriors are helping to get things back into control.Quest Strike (Blade)"
5,Easy to follow instructions,I used this book to make my very first quilt for my granddaughter. I found the book easy to follow and very detailed. Eleanor Burns has obviously done a lot of teaching and knows that even the smallest of details are important for a beginner.
4,Class required book purchase.,A required book to support a beginners quilting class I am taking. It is a great resource for the class. Pictures of step by step construction are good and easy to follow.
4,Engaging Collection,"Nice collection of tales from various parts along the Rhine. Engaging. The stories are from various parts and include several stories about knights, maidens, and ghosts."
1,An absolute ZERO!!!,"Granted, the covering is a very nice, high thread count, but there is NO filling at all. If held to the light, one can see a VERY small hand-full of down in each sewn pocket.... and it all settles into one corner. It just can't be shaken smooth.The comforter is going right back!"
4,"Educational, insightful; well-written","I read this as part of a history class in college 50 years ago. I recalled being impressed. I'm still impressed. The content in this book is highly relevant to current affairs.Further this particular hardcover edition has larger type than the paperback, plus there is space for reading notes in this hardcover edition. The type in the paperback is prohibitively small for me now."
4,Losing something in the translation was never so amusing,"Readers who love language and idioms will enjoy this book immensely. But I also think it is valuable as a culture lesson. Idioms translated literally do not make sense. They lose their metaphor and their nuance. But, when looked at closely, we realize they are kissing cousins to our own expressions. The title idiom can be compared to ""Haste makes waste"". We're all the same, we're just separated by language. It's a light read, but a fun one, and it's one you'll want to loan out to friends, but make sure you get it back!"
4,getting to know Chiapas,"Ciudad Real/city of KingsIn Ciudad Real, Rosario Castellanos creates a unique,beautiful and realistic quilt, sewing small stories about the life and death of the Chiapas people. It's a necesary book to those who care about people and it's history."
4,Reads like a novel but as useful as a textbook,"In my job as a social worker I have encountered women like the ones that Isenberg describes in her book. I found her book to be insightful and, although it reads like a page-turner, I find myself referring to it frequently in my work."
2,simplistic...,"The author is simplistic, repetitive, and amateurish. This book is already 12 years old. It would be interesting to go back and reinterview the case studies andsee how the women in the chapters are doing now...Certainly needs to be updated.One thing the author says is not true...that women who love men who kill...always believe their men are innocent. WRONG.Sheila, go back and revisit these women and write WWLMWK part two!!!"
1,"A biased, unscientific, attempt to pathologize.","Women who love men who kill by Sheila Isenberg is an unscientific, unprofessional attempt by the author to pathologize based on her own biases. It is obvious that her motive is to sensationalize and sell books. I suggest to readers interested in this subject that they read professional literature based on scientific research."
3,A good read.,A very interesting book explaining the reasons why women THINK they are in love with men who have been convicted of murder/s and are serving life terms.
5,Nice Wheels!,Easy to install and nice to look at. Paired up with tire chains and you get great traction on a light duty lawn tractor.
4,Made in USA !!,"Install per instruction's and all should go well. Did for me. Item received in GOOD shape and installed well.I am VERY happy to see these weight's ARE made and packaged in the USA.We already have enough Chinese crap in MY country, as it is.Good to see ""Made-in-the-USA"" again !!We NEED more product's brought back here ......"
3,Lipcolor,"Had liked the colorstay and Revlon went to an improved, why I don't know, line I could not find it in the stores.If you don't know the color beware it is not what it looks like on the page.I bought 4 colors and 2 were god, Also has a hint of old taste and smell."
2,Kimble J review: David Frizzell Best of The Best,"Anything by David Frizzell is impossible to get here in Australia. Nobody seems to even list him. There was only one song I was interested in and that was ""You're the Reason God Made Oklahoma"". I was a little disappointed that this version did not feature his sister in law, Dotty West, as his singing partner. Also this version seems to be a little more rock and roll but the melody is the same. Given the difficulty in getting anything by David in the past, I guess I have to accept that beggars can't be choosers and cop it sweet. The rest of the album did not appeal to me at all. The songs sounded tired and the music seemed weak and non committal. Maybe one day I will see a copy with Dotty West and I can purchase it."
5,REQ,"THIS BOOK IS A GREAT BOOKWELL WRITTEN, NICE STRUCTURE AND NEEDED FOR MY MAJORI BOUGHT THE BOOK AT A FAIR PRICE AND I LOVE TO SHOP WITH AMAZON BECAUSE IT IS MUCH SAFER THAN EBAY OR OTHER WEBSITES - PERSONAL OPINION-GOOD PRICE-GREAT BOOK-NEEDED FOR MAJOROVERALL HAPPY WITH PURCHASE, WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED[...]HONEST BUYER"
4,An Insiders look at the secret life of Pastors,"A very enjoyable, concise and to the point review by day, week, and activity of a protestant Pastor. Well written and an easy read. A few typos mar an otherwise excellent narrative. I strongly recommend it for anyone wanting to know just how busy and demanding, yet rewarding the ministry can be."
3,A step up from Ramen,"When this went on sale at my local grocery store, I decided to give it a try. For the most part these heat and eat Asian meals are unsatisfying. They have a ton of calories, lots of salt, and yet the portions are small and the flavor is kind of meh. This one is different from the others I've tried. The noodles have a nice texture--they are soft in the package not dry. The flavor was tangy sweet. The nuts add a nice crunch. And the prep time is less, because the noodles are pre-cooked. Overall, it was a decent buy. It's a little too high in calories and cost for me to buy/eat for lunch on a regular basis. But for something different, it's a nice choice."
4,Best X-15 footage around,"Another great offering from the folks at Spacecraft films. This one suffers a little because it gets a bit redundant on disc two. Basically it's a bunch of footage of launches and landings (there was little else to film since nothing could keep up with the X-15). Spacecraft films should consider doing a DVD set on the lifting bodies. There were 6 different configurations and great footage that hasn't been seen (plus one of the most famous crashes ever). Plus, there is more complete footage of the flights. It would be a little more interesting with the different vehicles and could avoid the redundency of seeing the same configuration (the X-15) over and over. In any event, Spacecraft films is to be commended for their efforts. This is another fine offering and hopefully this company will not only continue with the excellent spacecraft series but will also continue to release these experimental research flight sets also."
5,Doug E's Fresh!,"This is the one Doug E. Fresh album that puts a lump in my throat. This joint came out when I was in sixth grade and I remember every word to every song, especially ""Guess? Who?"". I could go on and on about how great an album this is, but any true Doug E. Fresh fan already knows that. I realize tha some of you aren't up on true old school hip-hop. As a matter of fact, I think some of you think rap began with Biggie & 2Pac. But if you take the time to listen to their elders, you may find the influences that made them so great. One of these influences is no doubt Doug E. Fresh: The World's Greatest Entertainer!"
3,Light reading but nothing new,"This book was enjoyable but to anyone whose grown up in Massachusetts it's like that third pass around of left overs. The book doesn't offer any new insights into tried and true stories. I would say this book is best suited for tourists or newcomes who want to know a little of the customs of the area they are moving too. If you've lived in Boston/Massachusetts or ever taken a trolley tour of the area, this book is below your level."
4,A different type of page turner,"Dair Canard has problems, big ones. A compulsive liar with a drinking problem, she has a husband that seems to have something to hide, parents who have separated, and a close friend whose recent and suspicious death was bizarre to say the least. Dair's life is definately spiraling out of control, and her lifetime of lying is starting to take it's toll.This is a well written page turner with just enough twists to keep the reader guessing. My only criticism would be that I found the ""animal telepathy"" angle a little difficult to swallow. Even an animal lover such as myself grew tired of the endless references to the character's pets. That said, this is still a enjoyable, albeit unusual mystery novel worth reading."
4,One of the best CD's I've heard for a while!,"After receiving a copy of this CD from a friend in Japan, I listened to it over and over and came to the conclusion that DeeJay Punk-Roc is some form of god. His music has such a unique style to it that it makes me wonder why there have been no mimics trying to imitate him. The way he mixes samples, jazz and every other kind of music you can think of is unbelievable. Definately an album for those who like the big-beat genre."
3,Attack by eagle games,Good game but the expansions are a must or you will get bored of game within a few plays. The board is a decent size but the expansion increase board to a very large size. So once again expansions are a must. The plastic playing pieces are a lower quality then axis and allies parts and the parts are exactly the same for all countries just different colors.
3,biography,"excellent verbal account of groups history. important to note there is only one actual song on the double cd and that is track eighteen,which side are you on. recommended to anyone who wants to complete a collection or who wants a detailed history of the group. very hard to find is paul's album planet earth rock and roll orchestra, necessary to complete the blows against the empire phase of the journey."
4,Can't find the instructions?,"It's folded in the packaging. The cardboard that the plastic is attached to folds out. It took me what seemed like half an hour to figure out where the instructions were, and it looks like I'm not the only one.ANYWAY, they do work, but don't try to crush them and mix them with food.. my cats smelled it in their wet food and then didn't touch it at all (they never pass up wet food). It's easier to cut a pill into about 4 or so pieces then hope they don't eat around it, or put real tuna juice on it."
1,did not eradicate worm problem the first time,"I am not sure about these, as I have reordered because they have not eradicated the worm problem in my six cats after the first administration. Cheaper than the vet so far, but I will have to see after the next batch arrives."
5,Highly Recommend !!!,"This works great...no problems at all. Have given to my 2 cats- 3 times now and clears the worms up asap. The directions are not the best so I ended up giving each cat 1 tablet, a month later gave 1/2 of the last tablet to each and ordered more to always have on hand- will always use this !!!"
5,administering medication,"I noticed that many people complained in their reviews that they had a hard time administering these pills. I did not. No, I am not an expert pill popper nor are my cats extraordinary. I simply held them on my lap, their back to my stomach, opened their mouth, shoved the pill in as far as possible (without being bit), and held their mouth closed, massaged their throat and blew on their nose at the same time until it appears that they have swallowed. I have used this method forever on dogs and cats and it is fail proof. I cannot tell you yet if the worms are gone, but getting my cats to take the medication was a breeze."
5,"Excellent product, easy to use","This is an excellent product when a cat has tapeworm. I had taken in some stray kittens last year and noticed that they had tapeworm. Not having the money to take them to a vet, I saw the product on Amazon.com and decided to give it a try, BUT was in a hurry to get it so I bought it at one of the Pet supermarts rather than Amazon. It worked immediately. By the next day, there were no tapeworms visible in her stool. I was thrilled, but wished I had ordered it from Amazon and waited for delivery. I paid twice as much as I would have with Amazon. I won't make that mistake again.The only issue is that, as others have mentioned, it is difficult to get the cat to take the pill. I thought I would try crushing it up and putting it in some wet food, but that didn't work. Ended up having to wrestle with kitty to get the pill down."
5,CAT RELIEF OF TAPEWORM,MY CATS ARE FEELING MUCH BETTER SINCE I WORMED THEM WITH THIS PRODUCT. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
3,Pills too big!,"We had a terrible time trying to drop these pills in our cats mouth. They are large and don't slide down very well. Even though we held his mouth closed for over a minute, he spat the remainder of it out every time. Luckily enough of the medicine must have entered his system, because the worms have disappeared. We just wish there was a better way to administer the pills."
3,Tape Worm Tabs Feline,I got these for some neighborhood cats that have been left behind when people moved. I would recommend a pill gun if your not accustomed to giving a cat pills (due to the larger size of the pill). But I was able to get them into 3 different cats with only one small scratch. The price was great compared to other medications.
4,It gets the job done.,"These tape worm tablets always get the job done. Got them for about half what they cost at retailers. The bottle provides 3 pills which is 2 to 3 treatments depending on the size of your cat (I use 1.5 for one treatment). Worms are gone, and stay gone after applying Advantage to the cat. We just skipped a treatment, so we had to use this again. I crush this up in 'grilled tuna in GRAVY' and my cat eats it up, semi-reluctantly, but she gets it all down with this method. It's great to see her up and about after this medication is finished clearing out the worms. The only visual side effect of this is that she will sniff everything non-stop for a few days after she's been treated."
1,how about the cardboard package the pill bottle was in was taped shut...,"Unbelievable, this product arrived as previously opened! It was scotch taped shut by someone at the company and sent out to a customer. There is no way I am giving that to my pet. Completely unacceptable. I contacted them to ensure I get a full refund and find out how to send this back to them. I will not be ordering from Entirely Pets ever again."
4,Works good,"It works!!I used the 3 tabs on 1cat & 3kittens. The gave the momma cat a full pill, the smallest kitten got half a tab and the other 2 each received 3/4 of a tab. No more worms have been seen and it's been a month, I check at least 3 times a day just to make sure they aren't back."
3,same voices - different songs,Its nice but it is all the same voices and on the scale from 1 10 on chourus that I have heard its about a 5
5,Great Reading,"This is a great book for those of us who enjoy fishing, those that are new to fishing and even for the person that just wants to know more about the southern flounder. Chester seems to have extensive knowledge on the subject and offers many ideas for fisherman of all levels"
4,All but the chorus....,"... perform brilliantly. I ordered this CD on the review recommendation of Mr. Peabody. His comments can still be read, and I have nothing to add to his praise for the music, for the performance by Tafelmusik, and for the singing of the four soloists. The other reviewer's dog-in-the-manger criticism of alto Michael Chance is irrelevant.Nevertheless, I'm not satisfied with the totality of this recording. The broad-band timbre and tuning of the Kammerchor Stuttgart distresses me. Choruses of 35 singers may have been available to Zelenka and other baroque composers, so the issue is not historical authenticity. It's acoustic recordability. To my ears, the sound of the coro sections on this CD is just a big white noise whoosh. If you don't happen to mind that sound, then you can adjust my rating to five stars. Even if you share my lack of enthusiasm for recordings of semi-professional choruses, you will be excited and delighted by all the rest."
2,Disappointing,"Not the worst book in the world, but just pedestrian horror fare. The book is about college kids on a road trip that run afoul of an ancient mummy or curse or something. It was really too short to be called a novel but the publisher did add a little novella at the end to keep us from feeling truly ripped off. They shouldn't of bothered. This was much worse than Attraction. Called Necromancer, it was just plain dull. Truth be told, I couldn't finish it. I'm sure Clegg is capable of much better and I did read enough to give another book a chance. But this one was kind of a thowaway."
4,ON THE MARK...AGAIN,"ok Douglas Clegg strikes again with an hit. Although it really should be classified as a novella, it starts typically with college students on a road trip to Cali. They stumble across a roadside attraction that they accidently bring to life.Kind of reminiscent of the killer doll short trilogy with Karen Black (does anybody know what im talkin about?).Not really too in-depth of the how or why and the ending is kind of blah but overall quite a good read and recommended for Douglas Clegg fans.Bonus novella of Justin Gravesons'beginning of Harrow but lefting with a thirst for more."
2,Campy. Too Easy,"This is campy, easy writing at its finest. That's not a good thing. Clegg keeps the pace up in this short novel but really doesn't offer much else. Its not a thinking man's horror novel i.e. most of King's novels. Its a shallow, short, campy story about a bunch of college kids on a trip trough the west. The story doesn't have any beef to it. A good read for a plane ride. Not so good if you want depth."
2,Very Dark,"If you are a goth, you will love this book; it will be a 4 star. If not, it's a little over the top."
1,What Can I Say?,I've read material safety data sheets more engaging than this. Stick with Graysmith or others if you want a good read.
1,Zero Stars for this book!,"Save your time, save your money, don't purchase this book.Yes, in NYC this guy was called the Zodiac, but this author uses California's infamous Zodiac Killer symbol, etc. on the cover. So much for imagination.The book itself is a total waste of time, the writing is poor, there are spelling and grammatical mistakes throughout. If I could have given this book a zero star rating I would have.If you want good true Crime check out books by Graysmith, Keppel, Rule, Bledsoe and Carlton Smith, these names are KNOWN in the True Crime genre, Crowley is not."
1,Cover of book uses notoriety of San Francisco Zodiac as major selling point.,I have not read this book but when I came across it at the book store one day I immediately recognized that the author uses the notoriety of the San Francisco Zodiac murders as his selling point. I am very familiar with the San Francisco Zodiac killings and I admit for a second that I thought the murders had been solved until I realized that the picture of the man on the cover looked too young to be the Zodiac from the late 60's. The release of ZODIAC in 2007 may inspire some viewers who are unfamiliar with the case to want to read the books by Robert Graysmith and may also buy this book as well thinking the case has been solved.
3,SMALL SERIAL KILL INSIGHT...,THIS BOOK GIVEs INSIGHT TO A SMALL PERSON WHO WAS NOT THE BIGGEST OR BEST OF THE SERIAL KILLERS I HAVE READ ABOUT. THIS PERSON WAS VERY RANDOM AND JUST WANTED TO MAKE HIMSELF A NAME.HE TRIED TO PATTERN HIMSELF AFTER THE ORIGINAL ZODIAC KILLER & DID NOT DO A GOOD JOB AT THIS. APPEARS TO BE A YOUNG PERSON WHO HAD MENTAL ISSUES THAT GOT TOTALLY OUT OF HAND & DESTROYED PERSONS LIVES IN THE PROCESS. A GOOD BOOK BUT NOT THE BEST I HAVE READ!!
4,Classic sound track,Nice mix of classic and modern sound in this soundtrack. A real treat.Tracks...1)Can't Find My Way Home by Bline Faith2)Cry of the Wounded Eagle by The Charlie Daniels Band3)Unknown Memories4)Theme From Sioux City5)Find Your Way Home by The Pipefitters with Lou Diamond Phillips6)Fly Eagle Fly by Toy Cladwell7)Jesse And Jolene8)Praises by Bill Miller9)Wrong Right by Toy Caldwell10)Visions
4,SIOUX CITY SOUNDTRACK,"Great rare soundtrack. Hard to find. Very moving Native themed music. If you loved the movie, you will love this CD. Features Lou Diamond Phillips singing as well."
4,Forever In Love,"Since the early 1980's, Luther Vandross has emerged strongly on the charts. Now celebrating over 20 years in the spotlight, his ballads still stand out strong.His 1998 album, Always & Forever: The Classics, is hardly recognized as a greatest hits album. Nonetheless, it still displays his unique talent in R&B music. The collection consists of some of his lesser known hits, and covers of old school standards like Going In Circles, Always And Forever, and Superstar / Until You Come Back To Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do).Always and Forever: The classics, is a fantastic companion album to Luther's 1999 Greatest Hits Album. Nonetheless, the music is still as strong and dynamic as usual, from the soul of Luther Vandross."
3,It's yet another Vandross compilation CD,"What can be said about that? It's not as complete as ""Best of Love,"" but if you want to sit down and listen to a disc all the way through this is long enough to do that without being too long.It goes without saying that a lot of the best/ later stuff is left off for the sake of having only a single CD."
5,always and forever,"Listening to this CD, one would think Luther is still here with us. He didn't miss a beat and gave us a bench mark that few vocalist will raise above."
3,"A practice lap for ""America Alone""","A compilation of his columns for the year following the September 11 attacks, Steyn's book is worthwhile for the reader who is not a contemporaneous reader of his syndicated articles. However, a better choice for the new reader as well as one who follows Mr. Steyn in the daily press would be ""America Alone"", in which Steyn evaluates the accuracy of his opinons and predictions (I would gine ""America Alone"" 4 stars). As an exercize in monday morning quarterbacking, both ""Eye of the Tiger"" and ""America Alone"" validate the politcal trends about which Mr. Steyn writes so compellingly."
4,A trip back to the dawn of the War On Terror,"This book is essentially an anthology of Steyn's columns dating back to 9-11.What is accomplished in this collection is reminding the reader of the thoughts and mis-conceptions that abounded in those frantic and uncertain days following the greatest incident of terrorism to reach U.S. shores.Steyn is, as always, witty and insightful. It makes for an interesting read and will almost certainly leave the reader with new perspectives that may have, at best, been covered up by the passing of time."
3,"Manish Gyawali: Biased, yet biased.","""Read his books. Then if you have anything to say, argue rationally for or against what you've read."" - Manish Gyawali on Paul KrugmanPractice what you preach, Manish. Let people make-up their own mind about Mark Styne's writings, as you implore in the quote above regarding one with whom your sympathies lie."
1,Conceited self-centered diatribe!!,I'm astounded to see the unqualified & effusive reviews for Steyn's book (so I've given 1 star rather than the 2 I would otherwise have given).There is no way that this book deserves unqualified 5 stars review. I'm also intrigued by the fact that 2 of the reviews plug Steyn's personal website as the place to buy Steyn's - more commission for the author??!!!!If you want to read about the views of someone who has absolutely no doubts on the rightousness of his own (& I emphasise his alone!) views on the world then throw away your thinking hat and wade through the essays. Otherwise do yourself a favor and don't waste your money or time.
1,Bed Desk not for Laptops,"I purchased the Bed Desk for use with my laptop. The first thing I noticed was that it was to high to use in bed. The second thing was that when you put the top of the desk at an angle, there is a wood stop that keeps the laptop from sliding forward. That lip is to high and it digs into your wrists and also the screws on the hinge were sticking out and gave my 2 year old laptop it's first scratches! It may work out ok as a serving tray or magazine/book rack for use in your bed but thats about it. Even as a lap tray when your sitting in a chair, the all wood underneath is hard on your legs. Not the best designed thing and am returning it."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Please be aware that this product is also sold at thebeddesk.com and there is an unwritten ""no return no refund"" policy. I purchased a bed desk for my father, who unfortunately passed away before it was received. Mr David Drake, the inventor and president of the company refuses to refund my money despite my having returned the desk untouched in it's original packaging. Buy at your own risk unless you can afford to lose the $50+ cost of the product."
5,Natural Is Best,"We started using Tushies wipes when our first child was having bouts of diaper rash. Switching to natural wipes was a key factor in getting rid of the rash. Now we use nothing but Tushies for our second child.These wipes do seem somewhat smaller than conventional wipes, but I found them to be adequate for getting the job done without having to use more wipes. Smaller wipes (less material waste) with no chemicals that perform equal to conventional wipes seems like a good deal for both my children and the environment."
3,Great alternative!,I have been using these wipes for about a month now. I had been using some of the other name brand wipes prior to these but I wanted to find a brand of wipes that used safer ingredients. They are thinner and smaller than other wipes but they get the job done. I really like the ingredients in them compared to others.
1,Terrible wipes - stay away,"These are the worst baby wipes I have ever tried. They are the consistency of wet kleenex. They are super thin, much smaller than normal baby wipes, and they tear easily. You can't clean your baby with them because they are so flimsy.I only bought them to get the $25 free super saver shipping, so essentially they were free, but even free, they were not worth it. We tried them once and threw the remainder of the wipes away."
5,Great Book Great condition,"Book was needed for summer class, came in just in time and great shipping price. Condition was good as well, thank you."
3,very small,I ordered an extra large and it is very tight. all of my shirts are large or extra large. this is the first extra large that I ever got that was too small
3,Referee jersey,The jersey arrived undamaged and sooner that expected. The medium size I chose was a little tight in the armpits.I recomend you get one size larger.
2,Not what I expected,This shirt is 100% Poly which doesn't breath and will be terrible if you are actually a referee. the web site doesn't disclose this. Great for a Halloween costume but that is about it.
4,Good quality,"Nice quality, feels good and lasted through the washing machine without any damage. Great purchase for the price and would buy again in the future."
1,Do Not Buy From This Seller! Faulty Products and they do Not stand by them!!,"I ordered 6 of these sockets for a 2 lamp project. Each lamp uses 3 sockets. I could not get the lamps to work properly, some of the sockets worked and others did not. I went crazy moving them around and trying to figure it out. finally, I went to an electrician who determined that 3 of these pieces of garbage were faulty. I bought 3 more sockets and sure enough all 3 sockets on both lamps work. I contacted the seller. My amazon account said that a return was still available. I contacted the seller, they told me to GO POUND SAND.who sells faulty sockets? AND THEN REFUSES to replace them! outrageous! I am out the money for the sockets, the electrician, new sockets, shipping and tax on garbage. I cannot believe this type of BS still goes on in this day and age.Do not buy from these people. you may end up in a similar situation and they certainly do not deserve any regular business from anyone."
3,Not by the British Winston Churchill,"This novel is by the American Winston Churchill, once a fairly well-known author, not by the now more famous British Winston S. Churchill. Winston S. Churchill's only novel was SAVROLA."
2,THE RAP INDUSTRY IS MODERN SLAVERY,"There is a slasher killing rappers and amazingly enough the cops are out looking for the guy. Two policemen take on the case. Good cop, Det. Johnson (James McDaniel) a black man who knows very little about rap and the white Det. Francelli ( Michael Mosley) who is curiously a walking rap encyclopedia and also plays the ""bad cop.""The slashing is mostly at the beginning of the film. At this point it turns into a lengthy who-dun-it with street interviews for filler material and a Spike Lee message. The production attempts to roll but then sputters on dialouge. The film needed to properly space out the killings and a more thrilling way to connect the dots. Like so many 21st century African-American productions, this film was long on dialouge and short on action. Some acting would have helped.Parental Guide: F-bombs, N-word, no sex, no nudity, some implied sex."
5,"An outstanding, wonderful read!",Padgett's Blue McCarron is so well-written and has such an unusual mind and point of view that I hope she becomes an ongoing character in other novels. The novel's plot is interesting and was sufficiently complex to keep me interested from start to finish. I am recommending this book to everyone I know.
1,Don't even bother,"The Bo Bradley books are great; with 'Blue' the author has managed to create what sounds like a great mystery while at the same time telling the story in such an off putting manner that it is a struggle to get through even a few pages. It is NOT the orientation of the female lead that is the problem but rather the excessive psychobabble that fills Blue's mind. After the first 3 chapters, I decided that dedicated mystery reader though I am, I didn't really care whodunit. Please, more Bo!! No more Blue!!"
3,Could be just a rocky start to a potentially great character,"I love the personal challenge aspect of Padgett's books; heroes that proceed without regard to personal jeopardy, staying true to their moral principles. Blue is such a character and I am really hoping that now that the initial book has detailed her ENTIRE feminist theory (she's a Ph.D. that parallels gorilla behavior to human) we can proceed with a more coherant mystery. I am also not all that interested in lesbian life and would like it to become only (?) a characteristic of Blue not the focal point of each story.All in all - I liked the book and will read futher in this character series BUT I really miss Bo Bradly!"
2,Disappointing book,"I loved the previous books with Bo Bradley and really looked forward to this. Unfortunately the main character is a flake. I was also put off by the lesbian angle and though I tried to be open minded about it, it was just too much in your face. I hope this was just an experiment and we can see more of Bo Bradley."
4,Witty and challenging,"Blue McCarron is hired by a man whose older sister Muffin has been arrested for murdering a man five years ago and hiding his body in a public freezer. Muffin has confessed, but Blue doesn't buy the confession. Blue is still mourning the disappearance of her lover Misha two years ago, and likes getting the money, but she ends up with more than she can handle when Muffin is murdered in prison and Blue is targetted next. It's a thoroughly enjoyable ride, but the mystery elements get baffling fast and while this could certainly derail many readers, I found Padgett's witty characters and exciting style drew me further in. Like Laurie King's ""Night work"" and Lauren Maddison's ""Witchfire"", there's a strong feminist thread through the story that educates as it entertains. And while the density of the convoluted mystery plot annoyed me until the very end, I highly recommend this book, and I can hardly wait to read the next in the series."
1,impenetrable,"it's interesting that one of the character's books was said to be ""moments of impenetrable brilliance"". wish i could say the same about this book. it was simply impenetrable. being a glutton for punishment, managed to stay til the end where it finally got better, but hardly worth struggle."
4,"New episodes, but default language is French?!","My 4 year old loved seeing the new episodes on this DVD. New characters (Trix, Molly) were a nice surprise.A couple complaints though: Default language on the DVD is French! Each time we play it we have to first go into the menu to switch to English. Maybe I got the wrong version of the DVD? And there is no easy way to get right to the Bob the Builder episodes... we have to sit through the Wiggles and other preview stuff first."
2,French Language Default and too many advertisements,"The DVD is not bad. My 22 month old son likes it a lot. The problem is going to be with the parents.First of all, the DVD default language is in French, so you will most likely have to stop the DVD and switch it to English. I've tried contacting the DVD makers, but have not gotten a response yet.The second irrating problem is that there are a lot of advertisements for different TV shows before the Bob the Builder program begins. I have to fast forward the DVD to Chapter 7 to get to Bob (Note: The French Language version has no advertisments at the beginning.)If the makers can issue a version that has English as a default language and no advertisements at the beginning, then they will have a winner. The DVD as it is now is not building any friendships."
5,Great DVD for little ones!,"We really like this video in our house -it's just great. My little one just loves watching all the stories. The story of the equipment moving someone from their home is really cute and well done. Lofty carries a couch through the air which makes for some interesting comments from the neighbors. I really like the fact that there are videos that send a positive message of working together and building things as a team. These videos are very cute, well done, and well worth the investment."
1,only if you speak french,the first copy I ordered would only play in French. Amazon took it back and sent another that also only played in French. They aren't able to send another since it is a widespread problem.
4,Great fun!,This was a great Karaoke CD. Lyric booklet is included and the background music was great. Used at a wedding and was a big hit!
3,Only for the die- hard fan of the Sisters.......,"This album is mediocre. I liked some of the new vocals, and the first remake of Alice was wonderful. The techno remake of Black Planet could have been left off, and the Valentine remake was pretty good. Overall only the die-hard fans of the Sisters should buy this album to add to their collection."
3,Best Of Craig Claiborne: 1000 Recipes from his New York Time,"The recipes in this book are easy to use and wonderful. They cover every topic, as a basic cookbook, without going into technique. I had been hoping to have the same format as the columns had been; a complete menu idea, but that is the only disappointment in the book. It is ""one more"" basic cookbook for my shelf, but certainly a good o ne."
3,Fun for older kids,"I bought this game thinking it would be fun to play with my little cousins. (I am 19.) This game really has a wide variety of Disney movies. In fact a lot of them my little cousins havent seen, just because they are ahead of their time. I knew pretty much every movie though, and it is a fun game to play with my friends who are around my age. I think my age group grew up watching a lot of Disney movies, so I would reccomend this to someone with a lot of Disney knowledge, but not to young children, unless you want to sift through the cards and pick out the easier one."
3,A little fun,"Well my disney fanatic friend bought this game recently. It's charades with a difference. At first it's pretty fun but you keep having to recycle the cards and funnily enough, unless you're a disney fanatic you'll find it hard going."
2,Too difficult for certain ages and what's up with the price!?,"I found to have similar problems with Disney Charades as I did with Disney Trivia . . .There was just a generation lost in this game . . .I remember getting really frustrated when I was 9 (or 10) and not knowing what the character I was trying to be was . . . . I know it would be too easy if it were just characters like Pooh or Mickey Mouse or Belle, but seriously who is going to remember who Jasper is (Jasper is the crook from 101 Dalmations by the way . .) and what little kid would know who Steamboat Willie is or that Horse character (can't remember his name) . . . It became known as the game that never ended (kind of like Monopoly . . .only in this case it would be because know one would be able to guess correctly . .).Thumbs down, Disney, thumbs down . . .NOTE: It's DEFINITELY not worth the price . . .I'd would just make up your own charades . .it's would be more fun and a LOT cheaper . ."
4,A Loving Mother,"ZenZele is a powerful letter from a mother to her growing young daughter. ZenZele has gone off to the United States for school, and her mother is writing her with the best advice she could give on life. This books contains personal experiences and memories ZenZele's mother. This woman lived a very full and unique life. You can feel the love she has for her daughter by reading her words. ZenZele is a wonderful and moving book. Once you read it you will never be the same."
5,This is a book so beautiful it sparkles.,"Zenzele is one of the most beautiful books I have read. This book carries with it all the tender and profound wisdom of a mother, a freedom fighter, a woman, and citizen of Zimbabwe."
3,Hawkwind - 'The Business Trip' (Griffin),"When I was first informed about this fifteen track CD release,I was wrongfully told that it would be a disc full of remixed tracks by the band's later '70's-early '80's repertoire.That was,of course WAY off.Turns out to be another live effort that's got at least three new/unreleased tunes.My favorites are the two Bob Clavert gems ""Quark,Strangeness And Charm"" and ""Right Stuff"" as well as ""LSD"" and ""Green Finned Demon"".From l992's 'Electric Teepee' CD,there's the previously mentioned ""LSD"" and the '90's Hawk classic ""Right To Decide"".The new(er) tunes include ""The Day A Wall Came Down"",""Berlin Axis"" and the jamming ""The Dream Has Ended"".If you listen REAL good,you just may notice some tidbits of vintage Hawkwind claasics like ""You Shouldn't Do That"" and ""You Know You're Only Dreaming"".As for a live album goes,'The Business Trip' is pretty decent.it falls SOMEWHERE between 1973's unbeatable 'Space Ritual' and 'Palace Springs'.Not a bad find."
1,Wrong Product,The product I received was not what I ordered. The St. Ives Vitamin E & Vitamin A Advanced Therapy Lotion - 18 oz I received does not have Vitamin A in it. It has a strong perfume odor which I DO NOT WANT.
2,A relief for the author,"This book seemed more like a therapeutic exercise for the writer than a truthful story of what the British troops did in northern Ireland and the way they conducted themselves, I hope putting all of this in writing helped the author. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
5,First Person Experiences of British Military in Ireland,"This book, written by an officer in the British troops in Ireland in the 80s is well worth reading, if you are a military history buff who enjoys reading realistic first person thoughts and experiences about some of the grimmer aspects of the British/Irish conflict."
4,Different and real view of the war,"Brilliant reading,would of hoped 4 more action but the author doesn't need to add fiction because his account is in depth and he makes you open your eyes to the reality of a war between neighbors"
2,Polar S725x Heart Rate Monitor,"Decent product, a little spendy, bad support.I purchased this and found that the software drivers for the watch were not compatible with Windows Vista, I don't care about other people's evangelical opinions of Microsoft products but I use it and I think that it was rather cheesey of Polar to tell me that I need to *PURCHASE* the new version of software that works with Vista even though I had just purchased the watch. I don't care that Amazon sold me a watch that was manufactured before you started to ship the new software, it's your watch Polar and not Amazon's. For that low class act Polar gets 2 stars. Polar, the correct thing to do would have been to send a copy of the new software to me. The next time that I purchase a heart monitor it will probably not be a Polar model so Polar, was the loss of my future business worth the amount of money that you saved by not sending the new software to me?"
5,The best polar option yet,"The S625x or S725x are still the best option for heart monitors. Robust, reliable and accurate. I already owned several suunto and Polar devices after I sold my S625x but I had to return to them.I just bought the S725x pro and this is again a great product, very nice looking and contains all the features to improve your performance. Go for it!!!!"
2,Cadence and speedometer can't seems to work,"I purchase this item with great expectation especially after all the rave reviews given.I got my item about 2 weeks back and happily installed the cadence and speedometer on my bike. However, it is sad to note that it does not seems to work.I verified that the device got the signal as light was blinking everytime the magnet went pass the receiver but the watch was receiving the information very slowing , like about 3 secs after I spin the wheel and did not even stop until about 5-10 secs after the wheel stop spinning.Speed reading is also erratic and wrong. For example, Speed reading from the watch suggest that speed was increasing from 15km/hr to well above 20km/hr even though I only spin the wheel once and it is visibility slowing down.)Having said that, the HRM function was very good and it also works well with the G1 Polar GPS I purchase separately.Anyone can advice what is happening on the bike ?"
3,Mistitled,"The book covers various technical aspects of writing scripts for different genres, with introductions to the various industries and discussions of what makes each unique, but there's very little about how to structure a story, so if you're looking for that, don't buy this book. If you're looking for a candid discussion about the pitfalls of finding an agent, marketing a script on your own, and the necessary evils of the WGA, then this is the book for you. Straczynski also includes a chart listing WGA-mandated pay scales and talks about how much you can expect to earn if you do make it in."
1,Uninformative and Unimaginative,"I purchased this book thinking it would give a basic outline RE script formatting and such. No such luck. It's a shallow skate over a thin pond of ice.It yammers on and on with useless advice, such as ""make sure you keep the original copy of your script"" (from back when typewriters were great). . . to the ""history"" of motion picture (who cares?) to advice about ""radiodrama"" screenplays . . . RADIODRAMA??Little, if any of the information was useful or is relevant post-2000. Don't buy this book. Save your $ for something worthwhile."
1,what a waste of money!,"I bought this toy for my 2 year old thinking she would really like it. WEll...The thing completely falls apart when you turn the wheel. Very frustrating . The music it plays is cute, but other than that, it's so not worth [$$$]."
1,We don't like it ! Waste of money!,"I thought this toy was so cute in the store, I gave it to my 3 yr old daughter this Christmas 2 days ago and we don't like it at all. The cloud seats fall off all the time and where is the 4th bear?? That's so weird! I am debating whether to sell it on ebay or just send it to the salvation army. Waste of money!"
2,"Not very well made, especially for the youngest audience","My daughter got this toy for Christmas this year. She is a very advanced 15 month old. Since the recommended age starts at 18 mos, I figured it would be a good toy for her. However, the cloud seats fall off CONSTANTLY. She gets easily frustrated because the Bears stay in well, but when she tries to pick them up again, the whole seat comes off! This toy would be A LOT better if they made the clouds so they couldn't come off. I dont see why they even have to come off!! May be a good match for an older child (over 3) who is very gentle and patient. A big disappointment, especially for the price!"
2,Don't buy this toy.,"I have 3 kids. I bought this toy last year for Christmas. It is really loud, the clouds keep coming off and the bears are hard to keep on the clouds. My kids never play with it anymore."
3,"Cute, but not worth the money","I bought this for my daughter because I thought it was a good value with the music and lights, and the four figurines it comes with. However, I am very dissapointed with the quality of this piece. The care bear clouds basically become unhooked and fall off the ferris wheel whenever you turn it. That makes it difficult to use in the manner it was intended."
1,carebear fanatics,"My 4 yr. old daughter who is obsessed with Care Bears got this for Christmas. My daughter lives and breathes the care bears but has absolutely zero interest in this toy! Like other reviewers have said, the cloud seats come off constantly. Once you get the clouds back on (which takes a fair amount of dexterity), then you have to really push the care bears down hard to get them to stay on right, and, in doing this, the cloud cars come off again! The other downer is that the music only plays when the toy is turned manually - maybe it's just me, but it just makes it so unappealing when the music stops the instant you stop turning it. Really only worth about half the price."
2,Not the best toy by the Care Bear makers,"My daughter received this toy for her birthday last year, and has yet to even play with it as a ferris wheel. The clouds keep falling off, and the bears do not stay on well at all. My daughter prefers to play with the bears by themselves, and the ferris wheel has been relocated to the bottom of her toy box, completely unused. We could have saved the money and bought her the individual bears to play, atleast then she would have used the toy for what it was intended. It is also too loud, with no possible volumn except offensive! I wouldn't waste my money on this toy."
4,Its a good one,"Very comfortable and looks chic, although I haven't find any difference with the ""Respira"" feature.Its a perfect fit for me and the delivery was prompt. I bought this during the Christmas sale and it cost me for a little over 40 dollars.Why four star ? Because I'm still looking for that perfect pair of shoes!I'll recommend it to my friends."
3,Geox shoe review,"This shoe is very stylish and is perfect with jeans. However, if you have flat feet it can cause foot and lower back pain because the shoe has a neutral gait and causes overpronation."
3,"Not Mary Roach's Best, But Interesting Nonetheless","I had high hopes when I began reading Spook. After reading her other books I hoped this one would help answer many questions I, and humanity in general, have about the afterlife. While there were many interesting chapters, I felt that way too much time was spent on nonessential subjects, like ectoplasm. In the end, it's a decent read, but all-in-all a bit disappointing.I recommend her classicStiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadaversover this one."
4,Very Entertaining,"Mary Roach has to be one of the most talented writers out there. Her ability to take any ordinary fact and draw you in is much to be admired.The book has some slow parts where the same information is dragged out for pages, but overall it is very informative and entertaining."
2,dissapointing!,I liked Stiff. And I wanted to like this. But honestly? I was bored with the majority of this book. Every twenty pages or so Mary Roach explores interesting themes but within a couple of paragraphs she completely exhausts them. Toward the middle of the book (which I felt like I needed to finish) I found myself skimming through and skipping several pages at a time.Her jokes weren't funny. Her writing was condescending. Her footnotes gradually became more and more annoying (and redundant).
3,book,"I was expecting more here. I thought there were many far-fetched stabs at explaining the afterlife. It explains what any normal human should know without looking for it. I can appreciate her search for answers, but this is not the right track."
3,Somewhat satisfied,"The book got to me quickly, but was a little more worn than I expected. I knew there would be some outside wear and tear, but I wasn't expecting a small section of the pages to be falling out. I was able to fix it, but would have preferred a book that was still bound together."
1,spook,"THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ.... NOT ONLY DID IT NOT DEAL WITH ANY SIENTIFIC REASEARCH, IT WAS TOTALY OF THE MARK SPIRITUALY. HER SATIRE, ALSO STINKS, SHOULD AVE THROWN $20.00 DOWN THE TOILET....."
3,But seriously,"How much does a soul weigh? Is there life after death? Can we communicate with the dead? And just what the heck is ectoplasm anyway? This are all questions that investigative journalist Mary Roach tackles in her latest book ""Spook, Science Tackles the Afterlife"" somewhat of a sequel to her earlier book ""Stiff"" in which she explores what really happens to people's donated bodies (you don't want to know).Roach's investigation takes her to several continents, exploring reincarnation in India, haunted spots in England, and lots of research in the U.S., and exposes many of the anecdotal stories we've all heard, but were not sure of the sources.Although the book is highly informative, as opposed to her earlier book, Roach's injecting frequent sarcastic remarks about the subjects of her study detract from what could otherwise have been a well researched tome on the questions all of us ask."
2,Spook is a Hoax,"Well, yeah, I was happy to pick up Spook since the previous Stiff was so great but couldn't have been more disappointed. Spook is unquestioningly the too quickly researched and written book with the offensive and misrepresentative title. Ms.Roach is neither amusing nor wry or even especially skeptical in her treatment of other worldly matters and her crisp intelligence, so abundant in Stiff, is hardly present. She obsesses about irrelevancies like ectoplasm but happily skips through more meaningful subject matter such as reincarnation and serious, known psychics like Alison du Bois of whom Ms.Roach merely presents as being all too pretty. Ms.Roach is altogether too sneering to a variety of personages in Spook in a way that made me cringe on her behalf. Yikes! What gives?"
3,"Glossy, superficial take on post-STIFF existence","Well, I guess it's a step up from the pop tabloid treatments we see all too much of. Chapters are allocated to separate subjects such as reincarnation, search for the physical evidence of the human soul, spiritualism, physical mediums, etc. Unfortunately, Ms. Roach seems to be far more intertested in milking wisecracks out of her ""research"" than she is in doing any heavy lifting, and the breezy, smartacre style wears out its welcome quickly. You can certainly tell she comes to the subject with a tabula rasa: she obviously never heard of Harry Price, much less other lesser-known parapsychologists. It's an entertaining read, but I couldn't recommend it as anything approaching what I had expected it to be: a sceptic's investigation into the survival of human personality after death. Think of it more as ""Cosmo Travels the World in Search of Spooks, Giggles, and People With Funny Names""."
1,Boring!!!!,"This is the second Mary Roach book I started reading and could not finish. Not because the topics themselves were touchy, it was because of the way the topics were written. I was bored beyond belief!! I expected a topic like scientific proof of life after death to be a real page turner but instead you get lame joke after lame joke. The writer also goes off on weird tangents and after a while of reading, you don't know what she's talking about half the time. Her other book that I tried reading was ""Stiff"", and just like the title of that book, the writing was indeed stiff."
1,VOMIT...Simply VOMIT,"What a waste of paper. I was in the airport and picked up this book. Shame on you Ms. Roach. This is a poorly written, unintelligent work. Please, next time use what is in between your ears to research and craft what you are trying to convey. What I got instead was a barfbag of poorly written ghost stories that went nowhere. No developed thesis to be found. Nothing I couldn't have gleaned from a chat with a half drunk barfly.Recast this book Ms. Roach."
4,Funny nerd and a decent researcher,"Mary Roach does an excellent job researching her interests, which happen to be mainstream curiosities, while keeping her sense of humor and sharp wit."
5,Compelling and Witty Read,"Mary Roach followed up Stiff with another home run. Spook is exceptional in both depth and breadth. For me, Mary Roach is what you would have if you combined Michio Kaku and David Sedaris.In this clever study of what happens to our spirit and/or soul after death, she presents a witty and entertaining look 12 different arenas that deal directly with after-death. While maintaining a skeptic's edge, Mary nonetheless seems to give the died-in-the-wool (pun intended) believers the benefit of the doubt as she joyfully pursues her research.From the silliness of ectoplasm to the sadness of medium school, the author takes us on an original ride that fascinates while repelling and attracting. I really appreciated the footnotes except that I wished she had explored these side roads a bit more. Oh well...maybe in another Roach book.I hope you find my opinion helpful.Michael L. GoochAuthor of Wingtips with Spurs"
3,Hoping To Get Stiffed Again? Nope.,"Even given the difference in topic between Stiff and Spook, the latter is much less enjoyable. It's not as steady in style and voice as Stiff; Roach swings between goofy personal familiarity and objective prose that becomes long-winded and difficult to follow in one or two spots. Spook also has a Borat Effect absent in Stiff -- I felt uncomfortable when she makes fun of subjects who probably didn't think, while speaking with her, that they would end up fodder for a laugh track."
2,I expected more,"I had high expectations for this book. But it ended up reminding me of Christine Wicker's ""Lily Dale"" book. And I didn't like that one. She seemed more prone to wanting to be witty and a non-believer than some one open to the paranormal. It was not what I expected from Roach at all."
4,It's a pretty fun book,"There is a reason this was never a best seller, but it's perfect fun for passive skeptics of the supernatural. I enjoyed it, it's not one of my favorite books."
2,Not What I Expected,"I expected a more serious look at this question, that would really make me think about my own assumptions about what happens after death. But, I felt the book was just a forum for the author to make fun of various beliefs. Mary Roach does have a great sense of humor, but if the intent was a light approach, then a more coherent set of explorations would have made a better read. I wasn't quite sure what the point of the book was, and even with re-set expectations, I don't think it was worth the time to read."
2,Not a favorite,"I bought this book for a club read and did not enjoy it at all. Someone else may enjoy it, but I found it hard to read and concentrate on."
3,What We Won't Know Until the Time Comes,"This is a fairly comprehensive review, from a (mostly) western European perspective, of the efforts made to communicate with the dead, and to ascertain the existence of ghosts. It does a good job of describing the legitimate and the fraudulent. Although written with some levity, it does bog down somewhat midway through the book because it is apparent that the writer is a determined skeptic, and it is evident before the end of each section, except perhaps for the last one, that the outcome is going to be of yet another fraud exposed, or another means of communicating with the dead debunked. It is in some sense a depressing book because it talks about our existence after death, and how, in all probability, we will never know what lies beyond until, well, we're dead."
1,"Good book, horrible audio version","Publisher's Weekly hit the nail on the head, calling the audio book version, ""a grating listen."" Quigley's snarky tone, distracting dialects and insistence on telegraphing the funny parts clash with Roach's deadpan writing style to the point where I had to give it up -- I couldn't even concentrate on the content. I love reading Mary Roach's books, and very much enjoyed listening to ""Bonk"" but this was flat-out unendurable."
5,Definitely not a serious study of the Spiritual Side - that's why it's so fun,"I too am surprised by some people's reactions; for one thing, I think the title alone should tell the reader about the tone of the book. It's not a serious contemplation on the existence of the soul, but rather a fun exploration of all of the quackery and experimental science that has been done in the name of trying to verify the unknowable. As a big fan (but not believer) of things like EVPS and the like, I loved this book. I also liked the silliness; spiritual seekers often take themselves way too seriously and there are some sacred cows out there that need tipping over now and again. It's also a bit of a history of fringe sciences, which is always fun and fascinating."
2,disappointing,"I found the book to be glib, superficial and wholly inadequate to the fascinating task of ascertaining the evidence or lack thereof of paranormal phenomena. It was more about Ms. Roach than the subject at hand which was primarily relegated to the status of prop to showcase her dry, sarcastic and ultimately dismissive humor.Anyone who is truly interested in this subject should read the truly superb ""GhostHunters"" by Deborah Blum which is a page turning and fascinating account of William James' attempt, in the company of several other prominent scientists, to establish the existence of life after death through scientific methods. Once you are introduced to the remarkable Leonora Piper, a 19th century medium, you will never be able to casually dismiss such phenomena again."
2,Juvenile,"I was expecting more. given her access tos a diverse group of fascinating but unconventional people, Spook rarely rises above pointing and giggling.Given the skewering Roach gives to her unwitting collaboraters, I wonder how many more books she can write before all doors are slammed in her face."
2,Editor needed,"Spook is marred by the kind of humour we find in most college newspapers, to the point that it intrudes so far upon the subject, afterlife research, as to render the actual topic secondary to the attempted humour. This is not what I was looking for, but if you are in the mood for smirking, chatty prose about a dilettante's breezy examination of afterlife research then this book may just be for you."
2,Not Cute,"Although I liked the book in general, I was aggravated by constantly being diverted by footnotes that only told an anecdote of what she thought was funny. I applaud her for diving right in and experiencing ghost hunting adventures and talking to researchers, but Mary seems to have no respect for people of other cultures or beliefs. BTW I am not a believer, but she should ""grow up"" as another reviewer put it. These people are giving her their time, and seem honest and sincere about what they are doing. Mary is not as cute as she thinks she is."
3,Entertaining but not very thorough.,I was entertained by this book at first because her research covered many areas I was unfamiliar with. I enjoyed that part however I felt like there was much missing. The Author carefully picked the items that already fit into her previous belief system and then rejected everything else. I am glad I read it because I can learn something new from everything...This is overall a very incomplete study of the afterlife.........
5,"Great book, even better introduction","While I greatly enjoyed real content of the book, for me one of the better parts was the slamming introduction. In it, Mary Roach lays out a case for believing in her God, Science. Even if you're not going to read the book, go to a bookstore and read the intro, it's really worth it."
4,Finally Some Sanity,"""Spook"" is a gentle and humorous look at the broad spectrum of supposedly-supernatural phenomena. It does not attempt to debunk all supernatural events as rubbish, but it does show how ordinary people can be easily seduced into attributing supernatural attributes to events that can be explained scientifically."
4,Science has trouble pinning this one down.,"Length:: 4:14 MinsHi, this is Joanne, a bioengineering instructor at the University of Illinois. I read science books and review them. See more at my youtube site http://www.youtube.com/user/joannelovessciencNot her best of the three, but still funny and thoroughly researched!"
2,"Reviewing the reader, not the material",I'm going to switch from the audiobook to a hardcover. The reader is awful! Zips through with ridiculous character voices and odd inflection. Sounds more like an inept standup comic than a professional reader. Avoid the audiobook!
1,A Big Disappointment,"When I read Mary Roach's first book, Stiff, I could hardly put it down, so when I heard she had a new book out I immediately placed a hold on it at the library where I work. Am I glad I didn't buy it.As soon as it came in I eagerly started reading. What a disappointment. The humor and writing style that made Stiff so readable are lost here. Instead we're presented with a writer who not only seems to have her mind firmly made up beforehand about the topic but also seems to be writing an essay, craming in way more than enough details and worthless facts. The result is a boring read that I had to force myself to pick up."
4,Prepared for Afterlife,"A terrifically entertaining book filled with human stories and events that should touch everyone. I'm now better prepared for the afterlife.This was a particularly good book for me to read when I was recently mourning the death of a dear friend, so it may be for others too."
2,Funny but uninformative,"The two word review: ""pretty disappointing"". Ms Roach takes us on a very personal and humorous romp through various aspects of life after death. Reincarnation, spiritualism, psychics, and coginitive scientists all get breezily examined from a very personal perspective. What emerges, though is more of a comedy sketch than a critical examination of the issues. To be fair, she states her intent clearly in the introduction, so you get what she says she will deliver. Although Ms Roach is mostly skeptical (and justifiably so, given the laughable evidence for life after death propagated by many of the characters in the book) there is little in the way of rigorous analysis or comprehensive review of any of the many subjects touched upon. Certainly not what I was looking for in the book, but maybe that was my fault for not reading the intro in the book store.If there is a category somewhere in a book prize for funniest footnotes, this book should be a serious contender."
3,Are you afraid of the dark?,"This book starts with Mary traveling to India to explore reincarnation and ends with attempts to prove the existence of near-death, out-of-body experiences. In between, she tries to find out if science can prove the existence of a soul, goes to medium school, and tries to hear (and capture) EVP voice recordings. All of this is reported with a sense of humor that is unique to Mary Roach. Though I didn't like this as much as Bonk, it was still quite enjoyable and a great audiobook to listen to (though the accents used by the reader are a little over the top). I won't tell you what her conclusions are, but I don't think you'll be surprised."
3,Not as good as Stiff,"For me, this book was okay. The source of my disatisfaction is what caused one reviewer here to give the book 5 stars. The writing was beautiful, but never said much. I almost wonder if Roach was afraid to go any deeper than a superficial analysis, like she was holding back or holding out.The information introduced is googleable and, in that sense, the book really doesn't add to the topic. It's a basic primer, that leaves you wanting more.I also would have liked pictures. At one point, I fanned through the book hoping there would be pictures to go with the prose. There weren't and I really feel this book would've benefited from some visual aids.The book is okay. The writing is beautiful, Roach has a gift for prose, but in this case, not for the subject."
3,Well-written but not definitive,"I almost didn't read this book -- I waited from 2005 until 2013 to pick it up, because science and the supernatural do not belong in the same book title. I sorta knew Roach would have to investigate NDEs and reincarnation and apocryphal ghost stories, and would have to conclude that there is no proof of anything supernatural.And she does.Her style is always witty & entertaining (like the columnist she is) and the book was a pleasant diversion, even knowing exactly what I would be getting. But she was a bit too credulous for my taste, a bit too willing to ascribe supernatural causes to coincidence and ambiguity, while ignoring the much larger issue that there is no credible explanation for how the personality could survive brain death.For failing to conclusively destroy the faith of the gullible, she loses two stars."
3,Not What I Expected,"I totally enjoyed Mary Roach's book ""Stiff"", this one not so much. I expected a more thorough search thru the many different modes of contacting ""the beyond"", but I was disappointed with the limited scope."
3,Hilarious and skeptical,"Mary Roach comes through as the most skeptical and hilarious writer on the afterlife, the soul, and similar metaphysical beliefs. Don't read it if you are not willing to be challenged on some of your metaphysical beliefs. Enjoy it if you are ready to let go of them."
4,"Mary Roach Does It Again... ""SPOOK""","From the author who gave you ""Packing For Mar's"", ""Stiff"", ""Bonk"" and ""Gulp""... Mary Rouch has done it again. This time she give's us ""Spook;Science Tackles The Afterlife"" I have always enjoyed Ms. Roches writings. I must admit, it took me, 'till the sixth chapter to truly enjoy this one. In a way, only Mary can do, ""Spook"", has a style all her own at looking at the afterlife. Between ""ectoplasm"", ""mediums"" and ""The Vienna Sausage Affair""..."
3,More Aptly Entitled . . .,"KOOKS. For that's all it is: a series of meetings with people who mainstream citizens consider ""kooks"" for their outlandish ideas (trying to quantify the soul, for example. She even includes an interview with someone from my former alma mater, Stanford. My view of that eminent institution sinks . . . )The first essay in the book is the best. Not because of the research, or any new revelations about reincarnation (which is the focus of the first essay), but because it functions as more of a travel piece (since much of it takes place in India). The dialogue between Roach and her companion, a Dr. XXXXX, is hilarious. Mary Roach, you are a keen observer of human foibles. Turn your next book into a travel piece, and I am sure you will be the next Paul Theroux."
3,A tough subject that is hard to handle,"I purchased this book half based off of reviews I read here and half based off of really liking Stiff and Boink!. Unfortunately, as many other has stated, the premise of the book is a little tough to maintain scientific neutrality on and Mary Roach falls off the neutrality wagon many times. Many parts of the book were rehashing of parascientific issues that were debunked forever ago, but the parts that weren't were approached with a nearly distainful attitude that made her studies hard to read.However, the book wasn't horrible. There was enough of the typical Mary Roach humor to make it enjoyable over all. While I wouldn't run out for this book, I am glad that I did sit down and spend a few hours reading it."
4,Great Book!,"I loved this book! I bought it after I read one of her other books ""Stiff"". Brought up some very interesting points and wasn't religious at all. Didn't have quite as many entertaining anacedotes but still quite interesting- it was a good buy."
2,Spook,"In Spook reporter Mary Roach delves into the world of paranormal research to bring to light modern science's tenuous relationship with the afterlife. Like Stiff and Bonk, Roach's writing is peppered with anecdotes and diverting travel stories, although her own voice is far more aggressive towards her subject than her other two publications (born from Roach's own skepticism, no doubt). While Spook is both interesting and entertaining I believe Roach is at her best when she approaches more quantifiable subjects, leaving Spook at the bottom of the Roach-stack."
4,I enjoyed this book,This book was exactly what I thought it would be..not too heavy. If I wanted heavy technical reading I would have checked out JAMA. I found the humor great.
1,I found Spook a big disappointment,For me listening to the audio book version was quite diconcerting. I felt the reader Quiggley did a poor job in the manner she presented the material IE in a scoffing manner.In my opinion the book is not worth purchasing
2,"Eh, not great. Rare instance where a book has let me down","This book is not up to what I expect from Mary Roach as an author. I feel that she is just filling pages with empty, baseless info....too many chapters on ectoplasm and medium spoofs....not at all what i came to expect after readin9 ""Stiff"". I hear Bonk is pretty good. I wouldnt buy this book, its not worth it."
5,A Lesson Before Dying - DVD,"The DVD was priced well, arrived earlier than I expected, and was in perfect condition. I am quite pleased with this purchase."
3,SAME OLD STORY,"What's interesting that stands out loud and clear, is those that see themselves as self proclaimed superiors really aren't all. When one has to beat his chest to tell the world he's great then he really isn't. With this story some people don't have to die to live it."
1,Not impressed,"I was not impressed with this book at all. As a hospital corpsman who has served in Iraq I couldn't help but laugh at the complaints of CDR Ruff. We all endured the same situations in Iraq and unfortunately some of us had to be deployed for a lot longer then 122 days. I picked up the book excited to read about someone elses perspective on the war, I was very disappointed to read only about how miserable one person was on her very brief deployment. Iraq is what you make of it, and complaining only makes it worse. Don't get me wrong I have great respect for the patient care but thats where my apprectiation for this book ends."
3,Military nurses,"The parts covering actual medical topics were very good. Our daughter is a navy nurse so I'm am sure we enjoyed it more than any one with out a connection. Well written and had ""heart"". Alot of complaining but considering the living conditions am sure she could have written many books just about that!"
2,Not so Good,"After completing the book I was disappointed in it content. I thought it would have more of the in depth nursing experience working under wartime conditions, not the moving from camp to camp."
1,"Not a real good Story, should be in the fiction section","I was Wondering what Bravo Surgical company CDR Ruff was in, I was in Bravo Surgical Company and I don't seem to find her account of the story the same. Where were 4 other NAVY CRNA's in that Company and I know of 3 that worked more than she did, preparied more the gear more and she, did more surgical cases, and carried the Anesthesia workload. She seemed more interested in walking off to the exchange than refilling the oxygen tanks. I really remember that time when she took her 9mm and waived it around at chest level saying ""I need help opening it"" as we all hit the deck hoping not to get shot. As other CRNA's did the work, and stepped up to the plate and saved he lives of Marines and solders; they were not off writing about it away from the surgical tents."
5,My dog loves this karate dog!,This dog makes karate sounds when you squeeze it. My dog is hilarious when she plays with it.
5,Finally a soft dog toy that lasts!,It's not indestructable but it does keep going and going and going with my pit bull. I like that the talking part went before the plush.
3,quality slipping,i have purchased many many of these Karate dog toys for my dogs in the past and they stood up extremely well under tough chewing...these toys fell apart in the first few minutes of use...it is like everything else in this country ...they are more interested in profit than a quality item that lasts
5,excellent pure sci-fi movie,"X the Unknown is one of those movies that will hold your attention from beginning to the end. The use of the geiger counter as the noise for the radioactive mud creature is QUITE effective. Dean Jagger was perfect in this movie. Leo McKern, as always, puts in an excellent performance.I know some of you will say 50s movie, no-way, or that it is in black & white. But please don't let that deter you from buying this. The movie is a like a book that you must read from the beginning to the end. Please don't overlook this gem from England!"
4,X-theUnknown,I ordered this and thought it was a DVD but it was an old stle VHS tape so I sent it back. The people were very helpful and accominating and I look forward to the release of X on DVD.
4,Rumpole of the Bailey meets the English Blob,"I will watch anything with Leo McKern! This is an entertaining, if primitive movie. I don't know exactly why I like it, but it's worth a look ... if only to see a young Anthony Newley wondering ""What Kind of Fool"" he was to latch this little item onto his thespian credentials! Why not."
4,Make Your Own DVD-Rs,"I have been making my own dvd-r versions for my private use for a good while. The Magnavox ZV427MG9 VHS/DVD recorder bought at Walmart for around $160.00 does a great job. Will transfer ""in machine"" or from any external source(DVD and VHS) to dvd-r. Add a $30.00 video digital stabilizer(made for VHS- runs a year on a 9v battery or ac adapter and will work on most dvds and VHS sources. Then get a $30.00 Video Sound Processor(like Archer from Radio Shack) and make your own dvd-r versions in full stereo(for all those sci fi and other classics in mono).Also, I daily use recorder timer to add titles from TCM, ENCORE, THE MOVIE CHANNEL, SHOWTIME channels available on Direct TV while at work or asleep.Your blank dvd-rs can be less than .20 each with a 500/100 spindle!Love my movies!!!"
3,I Spy,"Ian Anderson's fascination with espionage fiction drives the 15 tracks that clock in at slightly over one hour. The September 1984 release has no live drummer and Anderson is working within the synthesizer/electronics framework that was propelling the music industry, from the clubs to arenas worldwide.Anderson handles the songwriting chores alone and in collaboration with keyboardist Peter-John Vettese and guitarist Martin Barre. The concept - pulled together by Under Wraps #'s 1 and 2 - is intriguing and a soundtrack on elements of the Cold War, which had a number of severe hot spots during this time.An oftentimes overlooked album - as is most of the releases during the electronic phase in the band's career - it is a neat peek into Anderson's library and his attempt to merge several art forms in a pursuit of the shadows left by spies in the game of global politics."
4,speeding down the freeway--,"--a cool blast, metal all around you. This one's fresh and so tight it squeaks! Very fun. Amazing how Ian puts it all together, so different from other Tulls. An oddity you can't miss if you're into his genius."
4,Good book,"My daughter had the pleasure of meeting the author, Haywood Smith, recently at a book signing. She called to asny of her books and I said no and got to speak with Haywood on the phone. After talking with her, I ordered 5 romance from Amazon and my daughter purchased 2 of her humous books for me that day. The Red Hat Ladies is great and I have passed it on to my sister-in-law who was visiting and picked it up to read while she was here."
5,The Ballad of the White Horse,"This story is epic! G.K. Chesterton is a good author, and many of his works have deeply impressed me. This story not least of all. If you are a Christian, this book will encourage you, and by that I mean it will give you courage. The story isn't new. It's the classic tale of a dreadful battle, with unbeatable odds . The end hardly matters, of course, and the journey is brilliantly narrated by Chesterton."
4,Faux Pas on Cover,"I'm not sure what the publishers were thinking when they chose a picture of a white horse and a cowboy as the cover illustration for this great poem about the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon king, Alfred the Great. It sets the wrong mood for the story."
2,James Bond saves the galaxy,"I'm sorry, I just don't get it. Science fiction has, haltingly and with lots of recidivism, gotten a little bit beyond superheroes who can outgun/outguess/outfight everybody else in the universe. This book is a throwback. Our hero has no personality; the villain is scary, but of course the good guy drops him in one shot when they finally get together. It's pretty well written (hence the two stars) in between the cliches, but it's ultimately pointless."
3,Unfulfilled Promise,"Mr. Asher misses with this one. The main character ""Ian Cormac"" is almost a skeletal parody of the super agent. I found almost everything about this character underdeveloped and full of gimmickry. What kept me reading, however, was a well drawn universe of seemingly consistent and amazing technology peppered with unusual and plausible characters. Mr. Asher took the time to create an understandable history for this universe and skillfully shares it with his readers. Unfortunately he spends too little time on the main character and falls into an ending that is contrived, unsupported, and unsatisfying."
3,Good solid Science fiction,"Let's differentiate here, okay? If you see 10 0ut of 11 reviews with at least 3 stars, the work is decent. Is it excellent? The charasters are fun, but two dimensional (that's better than one by the way), and the plot is fast. I give it high marks for originality, but do so with the warning that all Asher seems to get published are works about one universe. I say this because like so many authors who only write about one universe he assumes that his readers will understand everything by reading all his work.Be advised, this problem is on a nano scale, he is a good writer and you can pick enough up in his book to have a lot of fun. I read Line of Polity and I know I will read Cowl. Everything I have read so far is pretty good. This is spy space opera and it works. No less deep than early Flinx, about on par with Sten or Mcade. Read it."
2,too buried in tech,"One gets lost in the techno stuff, for this alternate reality. It breezes through tech issues while telling an otherwise decent story. which convolutes flow of the processes that the characters use to achieve their goals."
3,Not that good,"Come on this is being over rated here on Amazon. Its a fair science fiction story written poorly by a novice author. The story is at times confusing and clunky. Its ok, but 5 stars!!! thats just plain ridiculous. When everybody throws 5 stars around others are misled into thinking these books are great works of art. You are doing other customers a disservice. I bought this book based on the 5 star reviews and this book is closer to 2 stars than three and I would rather use the pages of this book in the toilet and feel that I got my money's worth that way."
3,An interesting world--sleazy and futuristic,"I enjoyed the romp through this future, for the most part. I agree with others that the characters where a bit dry. Not sure the storyline was very compelling but I was curious all the way through. I found it difficult to buy Pelter's need for revenge, but the aliens where quite interesting. Glad Dragon doesn't live nearby. How is it that humongous and powerful aliens are petulant and mean? I guess if they were benevolent and wise there'd be no story.Sorry that the plot device of Cormac getting unlinked didn't amount to much. I thought it would serve as some type of advantage to the story, but it may have been more of an advantage for the author in telling the story."
1,Abandon Ship!,"Junked after 80 pages or so. Flickers of interest but a plodding, choppy read, with derivative ideas and lacking sympathetic characters. Not a universe I'd care to inhabit for long. I cut my losses and tossed this kindling material into the communal read bin here in Baghdad. If you're hunting for a fresher voice, read Richard Morgan instead."
3,Don't believe the hype,"In my opinion this book, while decent, has been overrated. Asher is a pretty good writer, and the story and the milieu it inhabits is fairly interesting. A few portions of the book are exciting and absorbing,others are confusing. I liked the edginess of the book, including the psychotic, murderous robot Mr. Crane. But elsewhere, the character development was inadequate, for example, Cormac's difficult adjustment to no longer being jacked into the ""grid"", which could have been intriguing, is barely explored. A decision of one of the main characters near the end is completely ludicrous given his behavior up to that point, a contrivance that serves an outcome that can be seen a mile away. Lastly, the book is absolutely crippled by a climax that was underdeveloped, abrupt, and unexciting. Asher's got talent, which made this uneven novel a frustrating read for me."
5,Solid Beginning to a Great Series,"Read this (and Brass Man) a while back and realizing that I would be unable to aquire the intervening books, I put the series down for a while, and when I went back to it, I re-bought Gridlinked on Kindle to refresh myself with the universe. Very intricate and complex, and though not as action packed as the later books, still an awesome read. This whole series is pretty fantastic, and the prequels are, surprisingly, just as good as the rest of the series. The later books remind me of some of Peter F. Hamilton's space operas, so if you're into the British sci-fi thing, you'll get a thrill out of Cormac, and Neal Asher."
4,Gridlinked is a ride!,"Rollicking, that's how I'd describe it. Get set for a pacey voyage into the future, following a man, half sleuth and half action-man. It's robots, women and aliens. You'll be wanting more."
4,"Rough around the edges, but well worth the read","This is action sci-fi. Don't come into this expecting deep character exploration or clever commentary on humanity, and you'll find a lot to enjoy. It's an interesting universe, and the author hints at depth that isn't elaborated upon. While I haven't read other books in the series, this one is well worth the read."
5,"It is a ""grows on you quickly"" kinda sound!!","I did not expect to find much on this album. My main reason for getting it was the Dion duet. But by the third time I played it I was really getting hooked. ""Do I Love You"", is that his wife or daughter? What a masterpiece of a song. Initially I was not sure how I felt about the woman's voice but you soon appreciate it for its uniqueness and honesty. Paul's powerful voice was the perfect complement for her soft and gentle voice. Barry Gibb infuses it with such a magical and haunting sound, the man is a musical instrument! And as if that was not enough Kenny G comes in and takes it to another level. It would be a crime not to have this track released as a single with a big promotional push behind it. Truly a great album with many surprises."
2,Not a 5 Star Book,"Length:: 3:36 MinsI understand that I'm going against all of these 5 star ratings, but I truly have no idea how this was such an insightful book. As my video will point out, I didn't get much more than a basic overview of what we should already know. Having such a powerful title and reviews, one would expect more. This is reserved for beginners and those intermediate networkers looking to touch up on their skills. Anyone who has been in the business for 4-5 years, better books are available (i.e Endless Referrals). Enjoy!- CharlesiCharles.com"
3,Tommy's second album.,"This was Tommy Olivencia's second LP release for Inca Records and it features Paquito Guzman and Chamaco Ramirez on lead vocals. Virtually everything from guaguancos to boleros to boogaloo to bomba to pachanga gets featured on this mid-1960s set. The sound quality on this CD reissue, however, does leave much to be desired (had it been better remastered, I would have given it a much higher rating) but any serious Olivencia fan will most likely enjoy this CD."
1,Awful,"I had the great misfortune of seeing Spineshank open for Sepultura a couple of weeks ago. They sound generic as hell. Their stage show was totally predictable, a lot of jumping around and a lot of screaming while playing run of the mill music. I was so bored watching them that I thought I was going to fall asleep. I had to go order a beer just so I had something to occupy my time.If you love crappy music, you'll love this album. Otherwise don't waste your money."
2,not a good purchase....,"This is not an album you can put in and listen to the whole thing! It sucked! I never throw cd's out of the window b/c I am a huge music lover, but this is no good!"
5,"Raw, heavy Spineshank before the electronic overhaul","The closest I have come to dying was when I was listening to this cd and totaled my car. There aren't many cds I'd rather be listening to than this one when I kick the bucket. It's that good.While I enjoy all three of their albums, this one always was my favorite. The vocals are very strong, and some of the songs remind me of early Deftones. But these guys are great examples of nu-metal, and they prove that it was a worth-while genre despite many of it's shortcomings.This album is very different from the other two. It's very raw, not commercially accessible like parts of the others were."
3,Little rough around the edges!,"O.K but could use a lot of work. Souns like Orgy and Fear Factory mixed and carries some heavy riffs. So-So buy. nest sone is Intake, Stain, and S.D"
5,Spineshank rock!,"Man, these guys are really awesome. The mixture of hard and slow voices are really great, especially in songs like ""Where we Fall"" where they go back and forth. The whold cd is really cool...these guys have a sound all their own."
2,Don't get too excited here people!,"Could anybody else rip off a mixture of Deftones and Fear Factory? Cause that's EXACTLY what it sounds like. These guys even suckered in Burton C. Bell for a cameo on one song. What was he smoking? The only good song on this album is the opener, ""Intake."" That's it! So, if you like rip offs, go with Spineshank."
4,Hmmmm......,"Not too original,but heavy enough for my taste.It get's alot of play,but their new one is F!#king RAW!"
5,These guys are the best!,"Spineshank is a great band. Good guitar, heavy and powerful. They sing nice and all of a sudden they scream and get really heavy. It's sorta like Deftones but Spineshank is better. If you like that kinda music you'll love the Spineshank cd."
4,awesome,"Yes, spineshank does sound alot like the Deftones with the same anguished-vocals-into-ear-piercing-scream thing, but don't let that fool you. They sound alot different in some ways. For example, Spineshank has many industrial elements thrown in for good measure. This album is a must buy even though the songs tend to get pretty monotonous at times. They even have Burton C. Bell from Fear Factory on the track Stain."
5,First Rate Industrial Electro-Goth For the Masses,"Spineshank has really struck gold with this one. From the opening screams on Intake to the mind-bending duet with Burton C. Bell on Stain (Start the Machine), Spineshank prove themselves worthy of such a great record label, Roadrunner. The best song here is definately the single, Detatched, which weaves a tale of agony and mysteriously swirls like mist when there are no voices. (Sorry, had to use the Coal Chamber reference) Other good songs are Strictly Diesel, Where We Fall, and While My Guitar Gently Weeps, with Amir Derakh on Synth Guitar. The only problem with it is the echoing cry of ""Start the Machine."" It appears more than once in the album and gets annoying. Otherwise, this is a great purchase. Other bands I recommend are Fear Factory, Orgy, and Deadsy."
3,Solid debut,"On Spineshanks second release they find their own sound while producing some complex arrangements and lots of overall heaviness. This is there debut release and though it lacks the heaviness and originality of the ""Height of Callousness"" it is still an essential buy for any true fan. There is plenty of good songs on this album, each track molding into the next perfectly (even know the songs have a similar structure and a couple of songs have very similar riffs), the best songs are Shinebox, where we fall, Detached the surprisingly well done cover of the Beatles While my Guitar gently weeps..and the awesome duet on the album closer Stain featuring Fear Factory's Burton C Bell. The production is excellent and Jonny Santos vocal range is evident on every track.This album signals the beginning of a great nu metal band, the best is yet to come."
4,Great mixture of melodic metal and industrial.,"Spineshank are a great group of mucisians.They mix various elements from various bands.Their vocalist,Jonny Santos,can be described as a mixture of Chino Moreno and Wayne Static.The electronic programmings are top-notch and the guitar work is fast,frenzied,and heavy.I'd recommend this selection for fans of Deftones,Fear Factory,Orgy,and Static-X."
4,It's a lot like the Deftones with a heavier Edge,"I like this album a lot. SpineShank is an awesome band who's sounds resemble a lot of the Deftones with a heavier sound. Most of their songs sound a like, but their distinct sounds make them stand apart from KoRn and other famous bands."
4,Ever own a British sports car?,"Anyone who owned a British sports car (or sedan) during the 50's and 60's, as I did, will appreciate the gruesome combination of innovative design and horrible application of technology in this film. The bureaucratic attitude of indifference to product failure and real consumer desires is an accurate reflection of the manufacturers of these charming, but flawed machines and the people who made them. Watching Brazil was like reliving a nightmare, as well as intensely thrilling as a satire and romance."
3,Brazil (Bluray),I have not much to talk about the film.The Film itself is a great one and everybody knows.But the Bluray.The image seems alright comparing to when it was made.But the soound is 2 channel.It's a Bluray for god's sake.I was very dissapointed.Supple seems good.Above all 1/2 satisfied.
2,"Brilliant, depressing","The viewer can not avoid being struck by the incredible genius of the filmmaker. The lavish visuals are not only outstanding in their own right but also carefully support the plot of the story.That said, I found this movie deeply depressing and don't ever want to see it again. It is the blackest of black comedy and I really wasn't prepared for it when I sat down to watch it: now that I know what it's like, I'm quire sure I'm not prepared to see it again."
3,Not Worth the Royal Treatment,"I saw Brazil again after many years, and I don't think it has worn too well over time. While still interesting and a bit provocative, it seems a little tame now. Also, the 3 disc treatment given it by Criterion results in one disc filled with Brazil-related documentaries that are basically quite boring, and one disc contains the 90-minutes version that Gilliam, with good reason, refused to release. If you are interested in purchasing Brazil, buy the single disc edition and leave it at that. I'm glad I only rented this one."
4,Thrilled and disappointed,"What can I say about Brazil that hasn't already been said. Yes this may be a difficult movie for some to understand, but it is well worth the time.While I was thrilled with the extras included by Criterion with this release, I was disappointed as well. The feature about the problems with the US release of the film were informative and entertaing. I also enjoyed the studios hack job to redesign the film for US release.However, I had hoped for a bit more, while the transfer of the film was good, I had hoped that the audio would have been remixed to Dolby Digital 5.1 as least, considering the cost.Still all in all this is an excellent film and a must for any collection"
5,"Great flick, I think...","I've always liked this movie. It's been probably ten years since I last watched it. The Criterion Collection version adds some new (edited out) scenes, but they flow so well into the movie that I can't say for sure that I caught them all. I've probably watched this movie ten times and I still can't say for sure that I know what happens to Sam Lowry (and more importantly, when). This is one of those rare movies that makes you want to watch it over and over to figure it out. And then you marvel at the creativity and wonder why it is that so many other movies are milquetoast in comparison. It also helps me poke fun at my government job, even if I do like what I do."
5,Do NOT buy this - a re-release is on its way!,"A re-release of Criterion's ""Brazil"" is being released in September and is available for pre-order on the site. It has the exact same contents as this three-disc collection, but they have upgraded the video to an anamorphic transfer after complaints were filed by viewers that the transfer on this edition was so poor/grainy.Not only that, but the list price is $41.99 as opposed to $59.99. The only difference is that there is an improved transfer on the new set and the cover art is a bit different.So, before you buy this, you may want to re-consider and purchase the newer, improved release by Criterion."
3,surreal and disturbing,"""Brazil"" is the second feature film by Terry Gilliam, of Monty Python fame. If you're familiar with Gilliam's extremely off-the-wall animated sequences from his work with the Monty Python Group, and/or have seen his first feature-length film (Time Bandits, from 1981) then you might be able to imagine what sprouts from his creative consciousness in his second full-length film.Starring Jonathan Pryce, Robert De Niro, Katherine Helmond, Michael Palin, Bob Hoskins, Michael Palin, and Ian Holm, ""Brazil"" is a sci-fi fantasy and black comedy that defies clear explanation (just as you might expect from Gilliam); rife with visuals and creative lunacies that amuse, fascinate, and horrify.Bryce stars as Sam Lowry, a bureaucrat in a futuristic world, whose boring life changes after his lovelorn daydreams of a woman he's never met draw him unwittingly into an increasingly surreal world that, since the making of the film over 25 years ago, foreshadows a possible future for us all."
1,Don't Buy Brazil on Blue Ray,"I foolishly assumed that the blue ray version of Brazil would have special features. It does not. I suppose I got the impression there would be features and a commentary by Terry Gilliam because the five star reviews spoke about a commentary, but if you look closely you will see that amazon has merely copied the five star reviews from the Criterion Collection 3 disc DVD version of Brazil and pasted them as reviews for the blue ray version. Shame on you, Amazon!If all you want is the best movies ever made on blue ray, then by all means get this disc. But don't assume that you will be getting commentary and special features."
2,"Rating for the DVD, not the movie.","Let's be clear on one thing: The movie Brazil gets SIX stars out of FIVE in my book. This review is not about the movie, but the DVD.I already owned the standard Brazil DVD but wanted the Criterion Edition because I'd heard good things about their releases. I am very disappointed because there isn't a dime's difference between the Criterion and the regular DVD. All I can see from the box cover is a slightly different widescreen aspect ratio and the time is a bit longer (perhaps some added scenes?). The sound is still in lame 2.1 stereo, not 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS . I see no excuse for this; Even the H.G. Wells' ""First Men In The Moon"" DVD, a movie filmed in 1964, is in 4.0 discrete surround.Brazil, excellent movie, but buy the regular release and a couple of other movies instead of the Criterion version."
5,Gilliam's not your average Python,"A good friend recommended this movie to me several months ago, knowing I was already a big fan of Monty Python, and I finally got around to renting it about two weeks ago. Wow. Never mind that I saw the American version with bad sound even for a videotape; this is one of the finest films ever made. Oddly romantic in most places, especially in the last half hour. Never have 2 hours and 12 minutes gone by so fast. All of Gilliam's Python work combined doesn't compare to this. See it, buy it, and if the song sticks in you head after, don't panic. Hum along."
4,Surreal Terry Gilliam,If you happen to like Terry Gilliam films and Monty Python you will really like this film. I purchased the special edition with lots of extra bits... I absolutely love anything weird and strange. The film is very disjointed but the cameo appearances of Robert Deniro and Katherine Helman are hilarious. It is odd from beginning to end.
1,An amazing movie -- but decide for yourself,"I put one star on this review to GET THE ATTENTION of people like myself, who find most movies bad. I always look for the worst reviews. To me, though, Brazil is the best.But, dammit, forget what I or anyone else says -- just like you have to forget idiotic rules about what the ""stars"" on a review mean -- and decide for yourself.I saw 'Brazil' first in 1986 or so. I thought it was good, but it was preaching to the choir ... I already knew how miserable modern life is.It's the end of 2003 and I just saw it again for the first time in 17 years, and I'm shocked at how hilarious it is! Much funnier, and much more from the heart, than the serious young man thought.See it. And if you're an old geek like me, you'll love the set design. The old equipmnent is aging really well! As is the movie."
2,"Much loved, but I never got it ...","This is a cult classic, but I find it over-rated. It delivers the zaniness, surreality and crazy camera work, but the film has no interest in its characters -- you'll feel nothing for them, and for me that leaves a big hole in the center of the movie.For a movie with a similar feel but considerably more heart, try Barton Fink instead. Or even Amelie."
1,Weird.,"Weird movie. Saw it in 1990. Still trying to suppress the memory. Even after so many years, simply seeing the name of the movie gives me the creeps."
2,"Trust me, this is no 'Blade Runner'...","Highly dissapointing Orwellian, Quasi-futuristic film. The story revolves around a homosexual romance between Sam & 'Jill'. A witness to an arrest due to false identity, 'Jill' is forced to run from law enforcement officials and is aided by his homosexual lover, Sam. This film shows sparks of creativity here and there, but will ultimately just deprive you of 2 1/2 hours you could have put to better use."
1,My Lord,This is another load of unwatchable excrement by the only member of the Monty Python troupe who had absolutley no talent...and still doesn't (Fear and Loathing anyone?).
2,Uhhh... what the hell did i just watch,This film could become noteworthy as being a surreal paragon but beyond that it is just confusing and time consuming. I thought 12 monkeys was good but what the crap was this. The environment was pretty cool but jeez. Watch this film when your high and it might be interesting.
4,Very interesting.,"Who else could have crafted this film this well other than Terry Gilliam? No one. This movie is in a class of its own, it might be an odd movie the first time around, but after a few viewings, it's more normal than most other films. Very well directed by gilliam, I personally think it's his best. With this you not only get a good flick that might make you scratch your head a few times, but you also get an interesting mix of actors in here as well including Jonathan Pryce(Tomorrow Never Dies), a small role from Robert DeNiro, Jim Broadbent(Moulin Rouge), and Bob Hoskins. If you liked this film then see some other Terry Gilliam movies such as: Monty Python and the Holy Grail, 12 Monkeys & Fear and loathing in Las Vegas."
4,Prescient,"Just watched it last night; Gilliam's portrayal of urban SWAT ops *precisely* matches how the Federales prefer to operate today (compare & contrast the Elian retrieval).The use of retro-technology is brilliant, as it removes the 'time-stamp', enabling the story to seem current at any time in the future.Not a perfect movie (some of Gilliam's story devices could be cut with no harm), but still essential viewing to inculcate:1) understanding that our public security apparatchikscan and do make mistakes (just see the Secret Service's raid of Steve Jackson Games in 1995, and the 2001 arrest of Skylarov in Las Vegas).2) appreciation of the art of the hack... DeNiro is the archtypical hacker, and his last act is brilliant...A very worthwhile experience."
2,dark,"My rating reflects how much I would like to see this film again, not the quality of the writing or production. This is the gloomiest of the Terry Gilliam films. The production values are high, but the story is poignantly cynical. If you can put aside the weight of the dismal, hopeless shadow cast on humanity by this film (which I can't), you'll find the story tightly written and the details meticulous."
2,Too Bad...,"It seemed like this film was going to be pretty good, and though there are some undeniably briliant and funny moments (resteraunt scene, constant forms), it simply did not need to be it's own film. Perhaps it would work better as an SNL sketch? It also seems to be an obvious rip-off of George Orwell's book ""1984"", exept ""1984"" actually delivers. Pretty much what I'm trying to say is that just getting a vague summary is much more appropriate than sitting through this overdone waste of time."
2,Love the movie...way overpayed for this edition,"If there is one thing I hate it is idle promises, especially when they come in the form of two extra disks of material that were supposed to give us great insight into the making of a film like Brazil. It is unfortunate that the regular edition of this film is now out of print. $59 dollars is a lot of pay for a movie with a slide show attached. I lost my criterion copy to hurricane Katrina and would not buy it again. There was nothing on the other two disks that were useful or interesting. By the way, I teach film and wanted this collection because the description indicated that it might give my students some insight into the creative process...it didn't. Hopefully the publisher of the standard copy will reconsider taking that version off the market."
2,Mr. Bentley in 1984 England,"The only thing that I liked about this movie is the creative set and the imagery.The movie drags on and on, and is just another example of how weird the British are.I would categorize this as more of a weird British musical."
1,Save yourself two and a half hours,"If you like never ending and story less tales that inspire only the hope that this movie has more to offer than confusion alone, than this tale is for you. This movie was meant to be visually stunning but for 1985 you will be fairly disappointed-Back to the future came out the same year and was far more stunning in my opinion, although maybe not ""artistically stunning"" like some say. I don't know what classifies as science fiction in 1985 but this is definitely not it, this should be classified as science crap that is incredibly uninteresting. I already wasted my time with this lengthy movie, please, save yourself."
1,A triumph for pseudo-intellectuals everywhere,"Bleak, disjointed, full of throw-away performances and embarrassingly bad attempts at humor and romance.Gilliam flipped off the Hollywood Power Machine and won, thereby forever culling favor with critics and the art crowd. It's too bad the rallying cry was this miserable, depressing, migraine-inducing exercise in cinematic vomit.Brazil is a misguided and pretentious joke, a crude, gas-passing Emperor with no clothes. I'd rather watch 100 hours of ""Mama's Family"" than sit through the damn thing again."
5,great,I'm a proffesionl film watcher.I love movies and I live with them. I should like to thank the director and actors / actresses of this movie and every one in the producing this film foe us. thanks.
5,Tiny mirrors reflecting the video,"If you miss the first five minutes of this movie, you will notget it. Everything began to fall apart with one person'sinability to live with their fellow being. It really is thatsimple of a story. That is the genius of Terry Gilliam....This movie encompasses this and everything else you can thinkof into the wildest, darkest, happiest, stupidest ride you everhad in your life! Probably one of the best ten movies of alltime. Sincerely."
3,1999 release Not anamorphic - 2006 release is corrected,"The 1999 release is Not anamorphic, and is not really 16:9.The ""September, 2006"" release, however, is anamorphic.I would advise getting the corrected 2006 release.Either the 2006 single disc, or the 2006 3-Disc Boxed Set.The cover of the 1999 DVD says 1.85:1, but the content of the movie is 4:3 with black bars padding the wide content. The result on a 1:85:1/16:9 TV, black bars that should not be there and a squished movie.This is a good movie, and you can almost imagine Bush in the film describing how we are winning the ""war or terrorism"" against the undefined enemy.But get the 2006 release.This comment is public domain."
5,future dystopia,"Excellent film. It explores the inefficiencies of bureaucracy and paints a bleak picture of a police state, which seems ever more realistic. The acting is fantastic and the ideas presented in this movie are second to none. If you like this movie, also check out A Scanner Darkly and Logan's Run."
5,I love this movie,This edition was a nice surprise for me as i grew up watching the VHS version. There are significant clips included on this DVD that must have been edited out from the old video cassette tape. The new footage is excellent and I was very happy they decided against excluding it from the new format.
5,"great film, it really happens!","I've already watched this film more than 10 times last few months. When I saw the film at first time, about ten years ago, I didn't understand the concept of this story at all. Maybe I was naive to watch this film at that time. For last ten years, I've been struggling to survive in this society. Then I watched ""Brazil"" again. Somehow, I understand this film so easily at this time. Since then, this film became one of my favorite one. I even own the soundtrack of this film. This film was made more than 10 years ago, long before the computer and other hi-tech become so common like we have right now. Eventually, our society become much similar to the one in this film, so does people's charactor. That's the weird things about cult film....."
4,A brilliantly flawed masterpiece,"We should all take care to understand that the two reviewers just below (""A viewer from USA, August 31, 1999"" and ""zu@hotmail.com from Ohio, USA , August 29, 1999"") have some very good points about the film. Yes, it is intellectual. Yes, it is a dark film. But what these poor people have certainly missed is the visual brilliance of effect and emotion that the filmmakers of Brazil have achieved. True, the car chase scene--admitted by Gilliam himself--is juvenile. But like most of Gilliam's film, barring Jabberwock, Brazil deserves at least two viewings. One to look at the dessert, the second to eat it."
5,"Stunning, extremely moody and sometimes sardonical fun-fare","If you are a film buff...if you've ever thought, ""What if"", if you love Sci-Fi and Fantasy, or, if you simply like to be taken away into a totally different dimension, then, DO NOT MISS BRAZIL."
2,Stylish Boredom,"If set design and sepia toned sense of bleakness were what was required to mint a movie classic then Brasil would be up there with Citizen Kane. That is not the case and Brasil falls far short. I could use up many paragraphs describing the short comings of this film, instead I will restrict myself to a few words, too long, unconvincing, tedious and in the end annoying. Terry Gilliam is a great set designer, sorry to say little more, this film in common with his other works is all over the place. Cinema would be better served were he to hand the direction of his films over to somebody who can actualy direct and keep control of the artistic direction himself. Six of us watched this film together and at the end only two remained awake. Nuff Said"
2,Weird,"Pretty much the weirdest movie I've probably ever seen. Some goodstuff in it, but, well, it's just weird."
2,Overrated,"This film is silly, and the plot is incoherent. Some people actually take this film seriously, but if anything it's a comedy. Unfortunately, it's not that funny."
2,"I understand this movie, but I don't understand anyone","having a love affair with it. The acting is good, the images (for 1980's standards) are fun to watch and the story is worth being told. What's pitiful is the writing, direction and editing. These three things, especially the writing, make the movie very difficult to watch. Character development and motivation is kept to a minimum, and instead we are typically rushed into another fantasy sequence or great set design that sometimes makes a curious commentary, but usually has nothing to do with the story.If you have high standards for a movie, Brazil is a disaster. A few good parts don't usually make a movie good. A few bad ones (especially when its writing and editing) can ruin a movie. It's not bad to use a little discretion in film making, but Terry Gilliam threw everything at the screen and virtually none of it sticks."
1,Don't waste your money,"Really this satirical take on Orwells 1984 is nothing more than a messy arthouse flick. I first saw this movie back in the 80s, my ex-brotherlinlwa was raving about it,to be honest I thought it wasa load of crap back.Acouple of weeks ago, I picked it up for ten bucks at movie warehouse, and thought I would give it another go, well I really struggled to stay awake when I watched it last sunday, and my verdict is the same as it was back in the 80s, ""a load of old toss"". Don't waste your money."
5,A CURIOUS ODD ODDITY?,"I must admit I didnt really understand this movie, it was very confusing, my face either had the Duh look, the perplexed frown, or the grinning wonder of an idiot. I gave this strange film 5 stars and I honestly dont know why?The cool but freaky 'fantasy dream' sequences really appealled to me, I also enjoyed the music, for some reason I found it curiously catchy, (the tune kinda reminded me of 'Batteries not included' even though Brazil is 2yrs older).I havent seen this on DVD yet but it looks pretty interesting, definately worth getting out again, now Im older perhaps Ill understand it better the 2nd time 'round! (I was 13yrs when I saw it last, Im hoping it will become clearer! ). Anyway even though I was confused, you first timers out there might find something worthwhile so try it watching it, you might be pleasantly surprised!"
4,excellant escapism!,"If your willing to think outside the box and just let your brain become completley immersed with the story, then check this movie out."
4,Dark Future,Nice futuristic work of the future where egocentrism and personal greed had taken absurd heights.A low profile top official has his life turned upside down with emotions experienced from a different epoch.Good work is a bit old-fashioned as too much similar was later created with an advanced audio/visual technology.
4,"Great, but...","So Brazil is one of the greatest social commentary films that exists, and Terry Gilliam really stood by his creation with beautiful imagery and some fun dialog.Here is the kicker though: Spend the cash and get the triple disc Criterion Collection edition of this film. The special features are amazing and the third disc has the edited version that the production company wanted to release. The beauty is that you can really see the big difference and how editing can make a HUGE impact on the telling of a story and the meaning of a film."
5,The warped and accurate presentation of bureaucracy,"As a member of public service for 22+ years, I found this movie to be excellent !! Robert DeNiro's role of the heating and air-conditioning engineer who would rather work freelance instead of with ""Central Services"" in order to avoid the paperwork, was absolutely astounding ! I even assigned the form number used in this movie, ""27B/6"" , to our standard trouble reporting form that is used in our agency. Some of the phrases presented in the movie actually existed with one County Government Agency with which I was employed for six years, specifically the ""We are in this together"" line, as this was the catch-phrase of our own union and County management. This is a movie that MUST be seen more than once in order to catch all the thought provoking background detail related to intelligence agency operations, and Civil Service in particular. Simply Amazing"
4,A fairly decent collection,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend's birthday/Christmas (they're pretty close together, so I can't recall which). He's a huge Gilliam fan, and he loved it so much, he actually told other people what I had got him (which he doesn't often do). He seemed to really like this particular collection; the only issue he had with it is that it included a DVD of the Hollywood ""Love Conquers All"" version of the movie, which he esteemed good enough to be used as a coaster."
5,Heavy movie,"Brazil is my favorite movie - as opposed to being the best movie I've ever seen which it is not. I saw the Criterion single disc edition. I am getting rather fond of watching movies with the director comments. I have seen the movie many times so there not a huge amount that I miss which is why I love Gilliams' comments.It is a dark movie, it's a dense movie. Gilliam pointed out many of the comedic bits in the movie. In an ordinary movie they would be funny but since this is such a dark movie, it's really hard to find them laughing-funny. No big deal. There's a lot of ""information"" going on and it really doesn't stop. A lot of what goes on is weird/strange so this movie is not for everyone. Despite it's faults (which I noticed after a few viewings) it's still a great movie. Ian Holm is incredible in this movie."
2,excessive to say the least,"first off, the movie Brazil..aka the first disc or disc 1 is an easy 5 stars. i saw this movie when we rented it and immediately fell in love with its quirky weirdness.now i would recommend this set to 4 types of people. 1.) completist criterion collectors 2.) someone doing a research essay on this 3.) people who can throw around 50 dollars like it is 20...or 4.) someone who lives, breathes, and worships brazil and/or Gilliam movies.otherwise, in my honest opinion, the single disc is all you need...it has commentary, a nice booklet, and the superb transfer. disc 2 is excessive to the max...aka more than i want, care, or need to know...and the ""love conquers all"" ending thing could have been added as a deleted scene on disc 1 or something.anyways, brazil is a great movie and worthy to be in any collection, but the single disc, in my opinion is all you really need."
4,Welcome to the IRON CAGE,... Read some Max Weber to have a better understand of this movieMY OPINION5 stars for its message2 stars for its setting and scenery4 stars for everything else5 stars for originality
4,A quirky movie,"TERRY GILLIAM has made a funny film about the future. ""Brazil"" was funny, quirky, and little odd. BUT there is no questioning, ""Brazil"" is fun!"
4,Original,"While not completely holding up over time this is still an amazing movie. This movie along with Bladerunner and visually noteworthy due to their incorporation of old and new to create a futuristic environment rather than just new(although I think Gilliam didn't intend this to necessarily be in the future). At times, and Gilliam sort of admits this during the voice over, there is a lot of pure 'stream of consciousness' themes added that, for me, don't necessarily tie in well with the rest of the movie. This is a very minor issue though. The DVD package is about all you could hope for if that is a deciding factor for a purchase."
2,Film nooooooooi. . .(bore). . .r,"Words--as I quickly age--are beginning to fail me. So I will quote:""There was a lot of money available to make (Brazil). The movie is awash in elaborate special effects, sensational sets, apocalyptic scenes of destruction and a general lack of discipline. It's as if Gilliam (the director) sat down and wrote out all of his fantasies, heedless of production difficulties, and then they were filmed - this time, heedless of sense.""There is a reason why Roger Ebert wins acclaim."
2,Has not stood the test of time.,"I was somewhat blown away by this movie when it was first released. At the time I new nothing of the wrangling behind the scences by the director and the studio which wanted to edit the film against the strong protest by Mr. Gilliam. After a recent viewing I have to agree with the studio to cut this film down to something that resembles a story and not the ""look how creative I am"" film Gilliam wanted. Once I saw the flights of fancy, the endless symbolism and in your face ""isn't this terrible"" scenes for the second or third time I was not enlightened but just bored by the directors heavy hand. The Special edition box set has some embarrassingly pretentious scenes with the director defending his ""artistic virtue"" and wallowing in his artistic excesses. Mr. Gillian makes movies that only young art students can enjoy, at least until they graduate that is."
3,1985,"Having just watched 1984, with John Hurt, which was made in 1984, I happened to follow it up with Brazil, which was made in 1985. I suffered from a bit of deja vu, I regret to say. The film is a sort of cross between 1984 and Kafka, and The Prisoner, with a bit of Barbarella thrown in. Sadly, it seemed to me overlong and rather overloaded. 1984 hits you in the solar plexus, but Brazil drags, and you can see the punches coming from somewhat of a way off. It's more of a visual experience than anything else, and quite good-natured in its depictions of the nightmare of bureaucracies and officialdom and service incompetencies gone mad. I did find myself skipping chapters, without the impression that I'd missed much. I regret this, and I'd better give it another try, when I'm feeling less saturated with Big Brotherhood."
1,I should be more fair...,"but, honestly, I totally agree with the other ""1-star"" review posted here...this movie is indeed a triumph for pseudo-intellectuals! I wonder if many who posted ""5 stars"" here and call people who dislike it ""dumb,"" just *pretend* to like it to sound smart. Lots of wasted talent. I disliked it not because I didn't understand it, it's becuase this film makes you wonder if the director simply took bits and pieces of shots here and there and inserted them at random places and use Sam Lowry's ""dream"" as an excuse for silly scenes. Tsk tsk, this film is the biggest waste of talent yet."
5,Great movies for the horror fan.,The Chainsaw movies are my favorite. These are no exceptions. I am happy that they arrived very quickly as well.
5,More than growing things well,"This is one of the Bibles for permaculturists, but I hadn't read it until now. Not just about recycling, and maximum yield, and moderation but an amusing very human and ethical book about how to live on this planet in a sustainable way."
2,Hippie-dippy Zen in the garden,"This book drove me crazy. But then, I have a really low threshold for Zen- and an even lower threshold for that peculiar style of reverent, whispery, needlessly flowery Japanese-to-English translation. Here's an example from the text- ""Humanity is like a blind man who does not know where he is heading. He gropes around with the cane of scientific knowledge, depending on yin and yang to set his course."" Now, the sentiment may very well be true-- but lighten up, Francis. That's the tone of the entire book, and it never lets up.If you're already an adherent of real food, permaculture, and no-till, you won't learn anything new here. If you want a snapshot of how the real food movement got started in Japan, you might get something out of the book."
3,The One-Straw Revotution,"I can see how this way of gardening exists, but it seemed outdated and could have been stated more currently in regards to Man's relationship with nature, for nature does know best. I still thought the book was good in pointing out this way of finally seeing how everything works in it's own way, if we just simply observe this process, and not interfer."
1,Disappointing,This book (story) was not what I expected it to be. The life and actions of the subject were disappointing but the final process for growing was intriguing. The moral to this was that I should not expect so much.
5,Good read,"Excellent book on organic farming principles. Very interesting story. Makes me wish I could have met the man, and been his student."
2,Avoid the Other India Press edition due to physical quality problems,"This review refers only to the version published by Other India Press, Mapusa, Goa, India, ""Seventeenth impression: 2008"".The quality of the physical book is disappointing. My copy arrived new, sealed in clear plastic wrap, but it has major quality issues. There are creases in the cover near the spine consistent with the book being placed under far too much weight at some point after binding. (This did not occur in shipping from Amazon - the outer shipping box arrived to me in perfect shape and the contents were properly packed and protected.) The pages of the book are not all cut to the same size, which makes for awkward page turning, and there is discoloration along the page outer edges.Also, be advised that despite the Amazon listing being ""One-straw Revolution: Introduction to Natural Farming (English and Japanese Edition)"" the text is English only. There is no Japanese text."
4,The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming,"I haven't done much review. But this book is one of my best book ever. Masanobu is a very wise person and this work is a piece of art. I'm not a native English person, but I can read the book without any problem. The content is very comprehensive and easy to understand"
5,wonderful for teens,"this is such a good cd for all ages . I work with teens 7 and 8th graders. We have the cd but we don't have the words to put on the over head, can you help me to find them. We are trying to play the songs every week. thanks"
5,Wonderful Worship Album!!,"With sons like Majesty, Awesome God, and Seek Ye First, this is a wonderful worship album. It is a great blessing to have such an album to worship our wonderful and glorious Father in Heaven with!"
1,"America's 25 Favorite Praise & Worship Choruses, Vol. 1",I rated this a 1 star only because the main vocalist on most songs is a woman. I thought it was going to be just choruses. Not really a sing-a- long CD for a man.
5,Lots of Current Pop Songs - A Great Value,"My kids just received a Karaoke machine as a gift so I got them this as their first CDG. I just wanted to get them something with some current songs. Clearly, it was hit. They knew all the songs had a great time with this. The lead vocals are not recorded on the songs as this is not a multiplex CDG. However, their are background / chorus vocals. This is a great Karaoke CDG if you want a variety of current pop songs. Plus, it is a great value since it contains quite a few songs compared to some other CDG's out there."
4,"Good, but not as good as Sound Choice","Sybersound scores big with this, the second volume on the hot hits series from Party Tyme. Not many errors were found on this CD, and the background vocals do the song recreations justice.However, this CDG also tells us that Sybersound has some more ground to cover before it can join karaoke giant Sound Choice, who has mastered the karaoke CDG market, at the top of the pack. The music found are not recreated with as much precision and as much perfection as SC has had, and sometimes, background vocals don't show up where they should (""Higher"" is a prime example in this). Sybersound's only two advatages over Sound Choice is that they are easier to be found, and they are cheaper to buy than SC's CD-G's are.Flaws notwithstanding, this is a cheap way to get some fun, and possibly learn how to sing. Just don't expect this to be found in a major karaoke bar anytime soon."
3,It's For A Gift - Not opened Yet,Bought a new karaoke machine for my grandaughter & this is one of manyCD+G's I bought. Time will tell.
5,Top of the line,"For me, buying an LCD flat panel was revolutionary. For far too long I had an old fashioned monitor dominating my home office. Something so big that throwing it away may well have brought about an unnecessary hernia operation. What a joy to unpack the ViewSonic. As someone who does a lot of word processing, I treasure this monitor's ability to spin so that it can be seen from both portrait and landscape. Seeing the entire page you are writing is such a simple idea, yet in 20 years of computing, entirely original to me. The software is one-click installation and designed for techophones such as myself. To pass back and forth between portrait and landscape, you literally just turn the screen, right click, pick the angle, and there it is. Whole process takes less than five seconds. The colors also seem strong and accurate, fine definition. Money well worth spending."
4,good monitor,"I've owned this monitor for about 8+ years now and today it finally died (backlight went out). 8+ Years is pretty good for an lcd with a ccfl backlight, unlike gateway/acer monitors which fail after a year. I would definitely buy another Viewsonic again. Good picture, and very solid."
1,Poor quality control,"It's probably a little late to say this now, but I found this, which was my first LCD monitor, to be very disappointing. At first I loved it, it was a state-of-the-art 17"" LCD when I got it new, no dead pixels, just great. But after six months it started having random fritzing-out issues. Very likely a bad capacitor in the internal power supply. I was never satisfied with dealing with ViewSonic warranty service, and I have since moved on, but I just happened across the reviews here and wanted to give my two cents as another very disillusioned ViewSonic customer."
1,Please Make The Beeping Stop!,"Well, I purchased this monitor based on rave reviews for gaming purposes. Truly the monitor has been great with one exception: The bloody thing beeps whenever it on standby or turned off but plugged into an outlet.I have sent the unit in for repair twice and have been without the monitor for over 2 months and still the unit is broken. The Viewsonic service team is just plain non-communicative and apparently incapable of fixing an easy unterminated signal issue. When I ask them how they repaired the unit they have no information as the repair site is in California and the customer service office is overseas.So...roll the dice if you like. The monitor is good if you don't mind crawling under your workspace everyday to plug/unplug the unit.Hex/Curse/Call to Demons: May the Viewsonic company go under."
1,Horrid Warranty service...BEWARE,"Beware of Viewsonic Customer Service. I sent a LCD in for warranty repair, so far it's been 7 weeks with no repair/replacement in sight. Check out Planar LCD's if warranty service is important to you"
1,You can count on bad pixels,"Since the beginning of the year, all monitors at the place where I work are being gradually replaced by Viewsonic VE710 units. It was my first experience using an LCD monitor on a daily basis, and after few weeks, I wanted to purchase one for myself. I decided on the model VP171B mostly for the DVI connector. After receiving it, I noticed bad pixels on the screen. I contacted Amazon and asked for a replacement. The new one arrived in three days (thank you Amazon, you rule!), and guess what? Bad pixels again.I may not be the luckiest person but, what are the odds of getting two bad monitors in a row? The only explanation I can find is poor quality control. Even though I liked the design and functionality of the monitor, I cannot recommend it."
3,Let Down,This was an easy install and all everything went okay for the first two weeks. Then the momentary black outs started occurring. The entire screen would turn yellow momentarily and I thought my whole system would crash. I returned it and bought a Sony.
1,Dificult Install,"The install was awful. It installed 600mb of stuff onto my hard drive and it still needed an internet connection to install. Just to launch the thing requires an internet connection. So forget this if you want to travel with it on a laptop. Why do they do this? I think it's so they can sell you more modules. Turns out what you buy only contains two modules, the other 10 you can purchase. Once installed it would constantly hang as soon as we went into the arcade. I ended up returning it. I also think, but can't verify because it didn't work right, that they show you the other 10 modules as places you can go, but are roped off inside the game. So your kids see these other 10 modules dangling in front of them. Meaning your kid will see these and put pressure on you to buy the other 10 so they can go there. Honestly, I think the game you buy is a ploy to get you to buy more."
1,Piece of junk,I installed this piece of crap on my HP machine. After installing when the kids try to run this from their non admin account this won't even start. Errors out with 'Error setting up channels'. So this crap requie admin privliege to pry on your accounts!?! And the contact # published on the inset paper was disconnected and the number on their website goes to a dead end voicemail. No replies for my emails even after 48 hours. I also would strongly agree with other people's comment about the online (not just online but a broadband online) scam! Never buy this product and I would even say never buy anyother product from such a seller even if that product is really good!
3,"Expensive for Full Version, Technical Issues, Good When it works","The initial price is just to get you to buy a copy. The 2 levels it comes with are hardly worth the cost. To get all the modules is insanely expensive considering the learning games just change the difficulty - there are no other learning games, just new sections of the game to run around. I've had technical problems with the graphics, and most recently with being able to play the learning games - but technical support has been non-existent despite multiple emails. The game itself is fun, my kid really likes it, he does learn with the games - but I have found it not to be worth the cost."
2,Vista issues and requires online registration,"This game locked up and froze on a recent Gateway computer with the Vista OS. I tried various work-arounds, including giving the software administrator priviledges and attempting to run it in ""XP Service Pack 2"" compatibility mode. These attempts were unsuccessful. I did install on an XP SP2 machine, and at least initially, the game appears to work.Also, I was surprised/disappointed to discover the game requires online registration. Thankfully, it did not require a correct mailing address to work.Also, be aware, the game attempts to ""sell you"" additional modules of gameplay."
2,"Daughter loves game, but must pay to use more modules - Beware!","My daugher really enjoys this game, however, she called to me after she had discovered two out of the 10 or so ""worlds"". Apparently I have to pay a monthly fee for her to access the additional worlds. What's particularly disappointing to me is that it's a monthly fee. As a parent that limits ""screen time"" I'll have to pay a lot for her to complete the game. Very disappointed that there are additional costs associated with the game. I'm toying with the idea of seeking out a new game for her rather than pay the monthly charges for this one. It's unfortunate as she really does enjoy the game..."
2,Not easy to open,"I bought these for Flu shots, opening 500 bandaids needs to be easy... these are not easy to open. Tears a bit at times."
5,Love these earrings!,"Love these, I've received alot of complements on them. I had feared that they would be heavy, but they are not at all."
3,Casper's Haunted Christmas,This is a great video.It's about when Casper and his uncles(the ghostly trio) are sent to Kriss Massachusetts by none other than ghost ruler Kibosh.There Casper must scare at least one person or he and the trio will be banished to......the dark!Also Kibosh has sent that pain in the behind snitch Snivels(Kibosh's ghost sidekick) to spy on the Casper and the trio.So with nothing else to do the trio call's up Casper's look a like cousin Spooky so he can pretend to be Casper so they wont be left stuck in the dark!
1,"Horrible, painful, amateur","I have to confess that I was not able to finish watching this pitiful excuse for a movie, it was that painful. I knew I was in trouble when I got 20 minutes into this supposed ""Christmas"" movie with absolutely no references to Christmas. The ""plot"", as it is, involves Casper being forced to scare someone or else a demonic being will condemn him and his uncles. Yes, very Christmas-y. I can't tell you how it ends, but I hope it ends with Casper failing and all of the characters in this film suffering a horrible fate.The computer animation is so poor and so outdated it looks like it was rendered on an IBM Pentium I. There are actual instances of slow-down and frame loss and all other kinds of video artifacts that I never see in any other video I stream. The voice acting is the only thing about this film that seems professional, but the script is so abysmal that the actors can't save it.But hey, it's free, right?"
3,Interesting,"Storywise it wasn't bad. It was kind of nice to see a new Casper Movie especially with Spooky and Poil in it. If It wasn't for the fact that it was done entirely with Computer Graphics Interactive I think it would have rated a little higher. The CGI bit though took away from it especially since Casper, Casper a Spirited Beginning, and Casper Meets Wendy were all Live Action. I have a feeling that everything could have been done Live Action"

4,Early French Cookery,"This is a well organized cookbook. I like that it goes through talking about the customs, ingredient, preparation methods, and recipes. Recipes are workable, and many use common ingredients. Some cookbooks of this genre do not offer reipes that you can actually cook. The honey glazed vegetables are good, as are the leeks in white leek sauce. I would highly recommend this book if you enjoy medieval recipes."
5,Lullabies,My daughter got this casset tape when she was 2 years old. She is now almost 9 and this is still her favorite tape. I'm ordering the CD for her as a Christmas gift. She will love being able to put it in her CD instead of always using the casset player. Its a wonderful tape. Very soothing and relaxing. One I dont mind her listening too. I highly recommend this oneA+++++++++++++++++ music
5,Excellent lullaby music - very calming!!,"I bought this tape when my twins were only 2 months old. I bought a little tape player for their room and we are now on the 3rd one and have now switched to CD. The music is so calming and a lot of catchy tunes and old ones too. One side played music with words, other side just instrumental. The woman singing - wow - what more can I say, she has a hauntingly beautiful voice. 5 stars without a doubt!"
5,"Allen, Ayers, Ratledge and Wyatt together...","Although some reviews I've read complain about Allen's guitar work, I consider it pretty good (of course, Gong's guitar work is much better). But if you don't have the single ""Love Makes Sweet Music/Feelin'Reelin'Squealin"" (just like me; does anybody know where I cand find it on CD?), it's perfect. The version of ""Jet-Propelled Photographs"" presented here, sung by Wyatt, is much better than the one presented at ""Shooting at the Moon"". And ""When I Don't Want You"" is pretty good too."
2,HUGE waste of money,"I also made the mistake of purchasing this for my daughter for this past Christmas. She and my niece had been wanting it since they first saw it. I really wish I would have used my head and checked the reviews here before I even opened the box, I definitely would have returned it. The tops seem to fall off if you jiggle it. The bridge is always coming off. The swing falls off every time a slight breeze passes by. Ok so that was a bit of an exaggeration but it is very poorly made for the cost. My daughter is nearly 3 and my niece is 5 and they can't get the bears to stay on the pieces either, they end up so frustrated I have to find them something else to do. The other day, my daughter took the swing and threw it in the trash can. I asked her why she did that and her reply was ""It's just broken junk Mommy!."" It's so disappointing too, because it looks really cute. Shame on the people who designed this"
3,FALLS APART!!!,"This toy is so poorly made. The castle towers just sit on top of the towers, no snapping in and not glued. The rainbow slide just sits on the side of the castle so it doesn't stay in place (you want it to stay there because when you press it, it makes a sound). The swing on the side of ours barely hung on long enough to look at it. Most of the time we had it, it was in pieces all over the floor. Returned it."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY MOMS & DADS!,"Horrible toy!!!!!My daughter has a lot of Toys...yes, we are Toys R Us addicts and I must say this is the worst toy I've ever brought home. I took it back right away. everything your reading is true about it. It's junk...just horrible.Light a match to $...You'll get more joy out of it."
1,A Total Waste Of Money!,"I wish I would have read these reviews before Christmas! I just decided to check them now to see if anyone was having the same problems we were. Of course they were.I bought this for my 2year old daughter because she loves the care bears! What a big disappointment & waste of money! Like the other reviewers said the castle tops dont stay on, the swing snaps off, the slide doesnt stay in place and its hard for a toddler to snap in the care bears. I threw out the box or this would have went right back! My daughter keeps asking me for the directions on how to play this! Too bad there are none. This is taking up space so unfortunately it is going in the garbage!"
2,SHOULD OF LISTENED,"Let's just say the ONLY thing this has going for it is the constant advertisements. That is what is sucking the kids in. I read the reviews, and didn't want to purchase this, but it was what my 3 yr. old asked Santa for...and the commercial is the only thing she has ever seen of the care bears. So I bought it. It is such a piece of garbage. Even my 3 year old gets frustrated in it constantly falling apart. She has fun the first 10 minutes, and then, after knocking off the tops of the castle, and the swing (why did they even bother) she gets mad and moves to the next toy. Even after you read the reviews you don't get what a pain this toy is until you buy it!"
2,Not Worth It,"The pieces do not fit well and fall off quite easily. It's interesting for the little ones for a few minutes, but that's all. It doesn't really do much, either. It takes batteries but plays the same little chime regardless of what part on the toy is activated/played with. A waste of batteries, too. This was a gift. If I had purchased it myself, I would have already taken it back and used the money for a better toy."
2,Figures not easy to place...But daughter likes,"My daughter really loves care bears.This set is not worth the price,but my daughter loves it anyway.The swing is hard for her (and Me!) to re-attach.The figurines are also hard to place on pegs for a 3 year old as well.I really have to push them down hard.She loves the little figurines and the sounds and just the fact that it's ""Care Bears"".Disapointed in the way it's made,Seems cheap.Husband wanted to return."
3,We actually liked it,"Unlike most of the people, we liked the Care Bear castle. I suspect that part of the reason is that our daughter is 2 1/2, and probably younger than most of the other children who got one. The construction is solid plastic, and the castle does not open up (unlike most other castles/houses). Instead, the roofs of the turrets lift off to allow access to the inside of the castle. While the turrets aren't attached, they are made so they won't fall off accidentally.My only complaint with the toy is that the baloon is just barely big enough to get a care bear inside. Another 1/2 an inch between the baloon and the basket would make it much easier."
2,"""Mommy, can you fix this...again!""","I bought this for my girls for Christmas and am promptly returning it tomorrrow. Nothing stays in place and the bears barely fit in the castle. It's as if the toy company said, ""Hey, this looks really cute! Who cares if it doesn't work right! The kids will beg for it cause it LOOKS so cool!""I'm going out tomorrow to buy more Little People toys. They are the best!!!Don't waste your time and money on this castle."
3,Don't Waste Your Money,"My husband bought this toy for our 3 year old daughter who just loves the Care Bears.She was very excited about getting it.We put it together for her and I have to say, it is the biggest piece of junk ! The rainbow bridge won't stay in place.The swing falls off unless you gently tap it.The tower tops fall off constantly and you can hardly fit the little Care Bear figurines in it.My daughter constantly asked me to fix everything on it.It was a huge disappointment for my little girl!We are definately returning it ! So,my advice..Don't bother wasting your time ,money or get your kids hopes up."
3,Over priced and poor quality toy,"My three year old loves Care Bears and really wanted Care A Lot. She enjoys playing with this toy or I would have returned it to the store. Like others have said, the castle tops do not stay on, the swing constantly falls off and the bears are too big for it. It is a very poor quality toy made of cheap plastic that is not worth [$$$]. Don't waste your money on it!"
4,Kind of a let down,"My daughters (age 6 and 3) were sooo excited to get this toy - and so was I. We are huge Care Bear fans and collect every Care Bear toy that comes out. When we got it home and out of the box, my kids started playing with it and did not stop for over an hour. They have really enjoyed it and if you asked them, they would say buy, buy, buy. My big complaint about this toy is how unsturdy it is. The pointed castle tops don't lock into place over the base - my cat walked by and they fell off. The swing and bridge don't stay attached very well and the carousel doesn't attach at all. Also, I thought it would be sized so that the posable Care Bears could play in it, but it's not. The posables are too big and the bears it comes with don't move. Overall, the kids really like it and I'm sure it will be played with a lot. I think that for the money, it should be a MUCH better toy."
2,Could have been alot better...,"My daughter loves the Care Bears, so when her birthday came around this year, this was one of the things I knew she would love. Grandma actually bought it for her & my daughter was very exicted & wanted to play with it first. Well, the fun ended once it was out of the box. Like others have said, it's poorly made. Things fall apart very easily & when our daughter plays with it, mommy & daddy always have to fix things on it. Finally my daughter just got so tired of trying to mess with it that she basically stopped playing with it after a couple weeks & now just plays with the bears without the castle. It could have been a great toy if only the company had taken the time to make the castle sturdy. For the price it sells for I figured it would be of better quality. I was obviously wrong."
3,Very disappointed,"I was shocked to find that this ...toy isn't worth the money I spent on it, it is maybe worth half of that price. First of all, the pieces do not stay attached to the castle. My daughter wants to play with it but every time she touches it something falls off. The three spires on top do not snap into place as the instructions state they should, the swing on the side falls off and the rainbow bridge just sits there loosly and gets knocked over constantly, the doors which open to reveal a hidden care bear which can slide in and out do not remain open so that the bear can go back inside. The pieces are very flimsy and cheaply made. I must say I did not return it because my daughter loves it so what I did was super glued everything where it belongs and now she can enjoy it. Also, an 18 month child will not enjoy this toy it is geared for a much older child."
2,I should have read this first!,"I wish I would have read this before having my parents by this piece of junk for my daughter's 3rd birthday. Agreeing with many of the 78 posters above me, the swing falls off, the castle tops tip over constantly, the posts are a hard for her to manuver and the bears are oversized for many of the rooms of the castle. I really don't see how any 3 year old could play with this for very long without completely demolishing it or becoming totally frustrated!"
3,Disappointed! Not worth the money!,"My daughter only wanted one thing for Christmas and that was this castle. What a complete disappointment at it's cheap quality... definitely NOT worth the money [$$$]. The swing on the side is constantly falling off and so are the tops of the castle. My daughter (almost 4) can't get the care bears to stay on the 'pegs' where they are suppose to. I even have to force them down myself. The rainbow bridge doesn't stay in place at all. Poor quality... cute colors and attractive, but definitely not worth the money. :o("
1,"About what I expected, unfortunately...","I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because it was the only thing she asked Santa for, and hey, who doesn't want to get their child their Christmas wish? I bought it even though I could tell just by looking at it that it was cheaply made and that it had next to no play value. And guess what? That's exactly what I got. My daughter was eager to get it out of the box, but she played with it for only a few minutes before abandoning it for better quality toys. Next year, Santa will try to talk her out of worthless garbage and into toys she'll actually have fun playing with."
3,ENJOYABLE but VERY CHEAP!!!!!!,"My daughter got this toy for Christmas. She is 2 and a half and really reacted to it when it was on TV. But though she loves to play with it, I must say it is a CHEAP toy. I can't believe my poor sister in law paid $40 for it as a gift. Nothing snaps in (towers, swing, bridge) so they are always falling off and my daughter gets upset. At least she likes to play with it, but if she did not, I would have returned it. Please, do not spend $40 on this toy!!!!"
2,CARE BEAR CASTLE,I PURCHASED 2 CARE BEAR CASTLES EACH FOR MY GRANDSONS ONLY TO BE DISAPPOINTED. THERE ARE A NUMBERS OF PIECES THAT JUST SIT ON TOP AND EASILY FALL OFF. THE SWING DOES NOT STAY ON AND I DON'T WANT TO APPLY TOO MUCH PRESSURE FOR FEAR THAT IT WILL BREAK. FOR THE AMOUNT OF $$$ I SPENT ON THESE ITEMS I FEEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CHILD FRIENDLY (ONE SOLID PIECE). LUCKILY ONLY ONE OF THE BOXES WERE OPENED (THE BOX WAS DESTROYED THRU THE OPENING PROCESS). I PLAN TO RETURN THE OTHER IN HOPES OF REPLACING THE TOY WITH SOMETHING MADE BETTER.
3,A Parent's Disappointment,"We recently purchased this item for our 3 year old. She had been talking about the care bear castle for a while after seeing it advertise on the television. She was very excited to finally get it, but her parents were not so excited. NOTHING stays in place...not the swing, the slide, nor the castle toppers. My daughter tries so hard to play with it, but it is so frustrating because it falls apart when it's touched!! It is so cute on tv, but such a disappointment at home!!! If I had to do it over again, the care bear castle would have remained in the store where it belonged."
1,AH!,this toy is horrible! i bought it my 4 year old and the items on the Castle keep falling apart. THIS TOY IS HORRIBLE DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH IT! IT'S A PIECE OF S H I T!
4,Great toy!,"My daughter received this for Christmas last year (she was 1 1/2 at the time) and loves it. I know the pieces don't stay on, but my daughter loves taking the castle parts on and off. As for the side swing, I did super glue that piece on so the swing would work. She also has 3 of the accesory toys, and loves those as well. She's 2 1/2 now and still plays with this toy daily."
1,Adorable Junk,"This would have been awesome if it didn't fall apart in every way. My daughter was so excited when she got it, it's colorful and has fun features. But it falls apart to the point of being unusable. It makes her so mad. Considering the cost, DO NOT BUY."
4,Care Bear Castle,"Well, I actually picked up this toy in the local thrift store for my 18 month old son. I was unaware that Care Bears were only ""for girls"" as my husband puts it. My son really loved this toy. I put it away for some time since his father thought it was girly and pulled it back out about a week ago and my son will sit and talk and play with the Care Bears and make them slide to hear the music. I cannot comment really on the durability since mine is missing some pieces since I got it from the thrift store but I can say it is entertaining for my son. He also has a little people barn but this one really lights him up."
2,Frustrating and way too expensive!!,"I thought I assembled the toy incorrectly because the castle tops kept falling off! I would not buy this toy again. It was too expensive, the pieces come off too easily when my daughter (who is 3) plays with it, and the bears don't easily fit into the swing. The only positive thing I can say about it is that my 18 month old loves to bang the castle tops together!"
2,waste of money!,"I bought this for my little girls birthday, and was extremely dissapointed. For 40.00, I expected to get something that was higher quality. The tops of the castle do not stay in place, the swing falls off constantly, and the rainbow bridge falls off. It is very cheapy and not at all as fun as it looks. Don't waste your hard earned money on something that isn't worth half of what it's priced for."
2,waste of money,"we bought this toy for our 2 year old daughter for easter.all the parts fall off they do not snap together. the bridge does not fit, falls right off. the care bears get stuck going down the slide. (...) my daughter hates it. do not waste your money!"
2,Piece of junk!!!,I read all of the reviews and saw that many people said it wasn't durable. Bought it anyway since my daughter HAD to have it. The castle tops do NOT snap in even though the directions say to snap them in. Fall off as soon as the toy is touched. The swing never stays on. Daughter was annoyed with it after 5 minutes. Only thing worthwhile are the figures. Biggest waste[...]
3,care bear castle review,"I bought this toy for my granddaughter who is 3 years old. In general she likes it; however, it can be frustrating because it doesn't stay together. The directions say that you ""snap"" the turrets, bridge and swing on. They do not snap on; and, in fact, keep falling off. I was disappointed but she did not want me to return the item."
1,Do not waste your money,The product isn't even worth half the money they want. You spend every 2 minutes putting it back together for your kids. One the worst investments in toys i've ever made.
2,many problems with this toy,"My girls love care bears! I was wondering if I put this together wrong. None of the pieces stay on. The tops of the castle, the swing, the slide and the bridge. It's all over the place! No fun at all for my kids."
2,Go with the new Little People Castle by Fisher-Price!,"My 2.5 daughter received this for Christmas from her Grammy. She had been talking about it for months and was so excited to open it. The tops come off for easy access to the castle, and she was able to put them back on okay by herself. But any little touch made them fall over, and I almost broke my hand trying to get the swing back on! The balloon's basket was way too small to put a bear in, and this is just made very cheap compared to her smaller Care Bear sets. So, we exchanged it for the Care Bears Ferris Wheel, which is much more fun for her. However, she kept asking where her castle was, so when I came across the new Lil' Kingdom Castle for Little People by Fisher-Price, we got that. It was HALF the price of the C.B. castle, and is 100% more fun and durable. Plus, she can find a place for all 16 members of her growing Care Bear family on the F-P castle! Hope this helps you all!"
3,Definitely NOT WORTH $$$,"My 3 year old daughter has been asking for this for months. She told Santa it was the only thing she wanted. Well she got it for Christmas and was so excited when she saw it. She has played with it some, but gets frustrated since the castle tops do not stay on, the swing doesn't stay attatched, and it's hard (even for my husband or me) to put the bears onto the tiny pegs so they can sit on the rainbow (which doesn't stay in place), swing, and teeter-totter. The bears are fine, but the rest is JUNK!!Just by touching the castle you can tell the plastic used to make it is cheap. I have spent the same or even less for other toys that were made 110% better than this poor excuse for a castle. My other daughter got the Disney Surprise Castle which is much better quality and $5 less expensive. In fact, our Care Bears are spending most of their time in it!"
3,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap","I can't believe that most all reviews sound exactly like the one I was about to write!And, to the woman who's daughter is slightly more intelligent, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this toy was not well thought out. For $40, this toy sucks! My 3yr. old daughter does like it but doesn't love it. It bothers me that all the parts come off because I have two boys and all they want to do is take things apart, and not put them back, so I'm worried that the pieces will eventually get lost. And, it does seem that the toy makers said ""It looks great, who cares how good it is"". Good thing it's small or else there would just be more pieces to fall off."
1,This Toy Is Junk,"If I were the manufacturer/designer of this toy, I would be sooooo ashamed. I spent most of Christmas morning 2003 explaining to my 4 year old that it was not broke, it just comes this way. Every part of it just falls apart, none of it even snaps together so it will stay for awhile. The heart door on the middle section would not stay shut after two days of minimal play, and the swing never stays on at all. The turrets (pink roofs) on the castles fall off if you touch the toy at all. I dislike that I have to give this toy one star, they need to include 0 stars as an option for junk like this."
2,Very disappointing,"I recently bought this toy for my daughter's third birthday. The overall quality is very poor. The castle requires adult assistance in order for the child to attatch the care bears to their different ""posts"" on the castle. The size of the castle was also disappointing (too small). My daughter lost interest within 10 minutes and hasn't played with it since."
5,carebears are great,"i bought the castle for my daughter and she absolutely loves it .of all the other toys that teach children violence and hate ,i think 40 dollars is nothing when my child plays with carebears and teaches her the virtues of life. helping my child when she needs help is not a big issue.rather than give her another toy that she plays with quietly with no questions and find out later that something shes done wrong was learned by a toy. whether it be 40 dollars or 5 dollars (carebears are worth it)obviously others agree because no one has mentioned bring them back....."
1,Oh WHY did they have to add this awful SCENT?,"I used to use this lotion, like another reviewer here, for years since it was both excellent and cheap, and I loved the fact that it had a very neutral faint smell. About a year ago, I bought a new bottle, and when I got it home, I couldn't believe this new AWFUL scent! I took it right back to Walgreen's, and St. Ives just lost a customer in my book. I loved the old version of the lotion which was worth 5 stars, but really this time around it's only worth 1 on account of this new unwanted fragrance. I'm going to contact the company and ask about this, maybe if enough people do, it might have an effect."
1,Terrible odor!!,I love the body wash. St. Ives has a Collagen Elastin body wash so I figured the lotion would smell and work just as great.Sike my life! Smells terrible. I'm sad guys. Really sad.
1,don't waste your money,"this is the worst cd I have ever bought. Aside from ""everything's gonna be alright"" the songs and melodies are horrible. They are so boring that I Haven't been able to get through any of the songs entirely. I would never recommend this cd to anyone but if for some reason you still want this cd, I'll give you my copy. Just promise me that when you hear it, you won't give it back."
5,Everythings gonna be alright!!!,"This is a great cd. The best song in my opinion is ""Everythings gonna be alright."" It is such a great and uplifting song. I recommend you call and request your local radio play this song. After you hear it you will most likely go out and buy the cd!!!!!"
1,Answering about Mahler,The beautiful Mahler being butchered on the first track is the Adagietto from his Fifth Symphony.
1,Pop pap,"This CD's only redeeming value is that it is unbelievably short. The songs range from boring and inane to irritating. Regardless of the classical music artificially infused into the background, this CD is nothing more than half an hour of filler material. Trite lyrics and uninteresting rhymes are beaten to death in a repetitious cycle that doesn't seem to end.Nothing lifts this singer's talent out of the current cesspool of R&B artists except for her somewhat smooth rapping ability. Her rapping skill is fairly well-developed and interesting. With obvious influences of L.L. Cool J and Salt & Pepa, Sweetbox's rapping persona of a woman in love comes across powerfully. However this is all marred by the complete lack of lyrical ingenuity. Her delivery is good, but what she is saying is filled with cliches and rhymes that are fit for a 4th grade poetry contest.Stay away from this one, it isn't worth 15 bucks."
4,Very good book,"I found this book exhaustive, yet concise. I mean, it covers every major topic on public administration. But uses a very straightforward style that allows you to easily find and read the information you are looking for. It is a very good book for graduate students of public administration and also a great reference book to have on your library if you are a PA professor."
2,Good nudity.....Terrible transfer,"As a man who has enjoyed the new-found popularity of old grindhouse and sexploitation films, I have to say that the films were excellent examples of German sex comedies. As is typical, the humor is often juvenile but the nudity is far better that you would ever see in it's American counterparts. People rarely buy these for the subtle humor, right? With that being said, I was highly disappointed in the transfer quality. I am not looking for anything perfect, with these films not exactly deserving of the full shine and polish, but some effort should have been made to reduce the skips and jumps. There are three or four times that you can see tracking errors from the original shoddy VHS that these were pulled from. These actually obscure the picture in several places and some jumps can be seen. I am guessing that the studio never watched the final product....Otherwise these are fun and sexy, (if not particularly memorable) films."
4,Lotsa Fun!,"If you enjoy this type of movie,you will enjoy these. They are truly comedies, unlike the Euro collection which is more drama-(OK but not as much fun). The plots are lightweight and lighthearted (and very thin, but who cares). True there are a couple of technical flaws, but only a couple and they are short. Indeed in one movie the screen actually goes dark for what seemed like 15-20 seconds, but don't panic the picture resumes and the fun continues! Enjoy! For the price you certainly get your money's worth."
1,Bavarian sex comedy,This movie was a waste of time and money .... I wouldn't tell anybodyto buy this ..... it was a ripe-offBernie Sanic
2,Doesn't meet Product Description specs,"Although the Product Description claims the table lifts to 35 7/16"", it bairly raises to 35"". Listing a seperate ""Raised Height"" of 37 7/16"" is misleading because the table only raises to 35"" with the hydraulic pump."
5,they really know how to put on a show,"As a hanson fan, i may be a little bias in telling you that i think this is a great, great album, but the shocked expressions on my friends faces after i tell them the songs they've been rocking out to are those ""girlie looking boys who sang mmmbop"" has told me that i'm not just blinded by my own personal love of these guys. Hanson, unfortunately, has a bad rep for being a boy band because their biggest hit was when the oldest member was a mere 16. It's really sad because those young boys grew up to be very talented musicians, songwriters and performers. The best of hanson; Live and electric is a reminder to me of how much Isaac, Taylor and Zac have been a part of my life for the past 9 years. But, hey it might even be better if you haven't been a fan for all that time as it means you can enjoy hanson at their best, straight away. I urge you to buy this album, kick back, relax and listen to some damn good music."
5,Hanson fan,I love this c.d. and dvd I wish that Hanson came to AZ so I could have gone and see them I have seen them in concert 3 times in concert and I really want to go and see them in concert. So I hope that they came and I can see them. I think that Hanson is great singers and get musicians....
5,Great album,"Great sound from the Charlotte, NC band. Harmony and great guitar work, with some heartfelt songwriting, blend in to make this a must listen. I can listen to it all and not hit the skip button.... these days thats hard to find. These guys deserve some national attention! Five stars all the way!!"
2,Beware!,"My firends and I are EXTREMELY disappointed with this game. The DVD is basically useless. If Hasbro would have been willing to pay some royalties they could have used actual movie and video clips which would have made this game fun. Instead they use horrible graphics with still photos or Scrabble type words to get you to guess the answer. Meanwhile they flash the answer too quickly for any kind of team play and you cannot pause the DVD at all.If you still want to buy this, I will sell you mine since I will not be using it again."
2,"Repetition, Repetition, Repetition","The game itself is pretty fun, but the DVD has some problems. We played the game twice and ended up with the same questions popping up on the dvd within the same game. There is only one box of cards to play with and we repeated on these also. Needs more variety, more cards, and a better system with the DVD. The concept is good, just needs some work. I'll stick with Genus IV or 20th Anniversary Edition."
1,Big Disappointment,"This game is really lame. We couldn't even use the DVD because after the first question in each category, it just kept repeating the same questions. So we just played it the old-fashioned way, using the cards. But why pay extra for the DVD edition, then? (Someone said that if you're playing on a cheaper DVD player, that might happen. But I don't think I should have to go out and buy a new DVD player just to play this game.)Not only that, but the questions we did get to see on the DVD weren't all that great. At least a couple of them were just questions, no video clips, no musical hints, nothing that would require them to be on a DVD as opposed to on a card. For example, ""What two words make up the word modem?"" and ""What musical instrument does Lucy Liu play?"" I expected to see things on the DVD that you wouldn't get in the regular version.Very disappointed."
1,Don't waste your money,"We received this as a gift, and were quite excited to play it as a family. The first time through was great - we especially enjoyed the fact that after a point, all players could jump in on the ""wedge"" questions. HOWEVER, we did see shades of the problem that would become truly TIRESOME by the second time we played it - the repetition of the questions on the DVD. Honestly, by the second time we played it, there were so many questions we'd seen before that we never even finished the game and swore to never play it again. I am in the process of returning it to Hasbro."
2,Great idea with some major problems,"The idea of the DVD is a great idea. The first game we played we had a blast. You use the DVD in place of the cards when you are trying to get your piece of pie. The game pieces are really fun. They are 3d pieces of a lava lamp, cassette, joystick, and cell phone. After only two games we found the the dvd started to repeat itself and ask the same questions over and over. The instructions say to go back to the menu on the dvd and select the catagory again to get a new question. We found ourselves having to do this five times in order to get a new question. It is a great idea but $40 dollars is pretty steep for only two to three games of original questions. Also, they only give you one box of questions. On a positive note, the game pieces are really fun and novell."
3,Overall good game but can be time consuming,"I received this game for Christmas. I played it a few times. The questions are more geared towards the young adult (20's). I didn't find the questions too hard. The DVD part is fun. A lot of questions and it spices up the game (i.e. Video questions, scrambled pictures, word finds). The only downfall about the game is that it takes a very long time to finish."
5,"Great game for 20 ""somethings"" to 60 ""somethings""","I bought this game to play with our families after Thanksgiving dinner. My husband, another couple, and I ""previewed"" it last night and had so much fun. There are some questions that are challenging, with only a couple that no one had a clue about. There are questions in here that my parent's (in their 50's) will enjoy and know, along with ones that my baby sister will get. If you like tv, movies, music, or sports, this is a game for you. My husband isn't a big board game person but he really liked this game....that's saying a lot."
4,A nice variation on a classic game,"As a huge fan of Trivial Pursuit, any new version is a great addition to my collection. I was, however, disappointed to find only 4 playing pieces and about half as many cards as a regular set. The DVD is used on the pie piece spaces, which is a fun twist, but after playing only twice we saw several questions repeat themselves. That being said, I would still recommend this game because it is, after all, Trivial Pursuit!"
2,Fun at first,"My boyfriend and I invited two friends over to our house after purchasing this game. We played one full game full of reminiscing and laughter. A few days later we sat down just the two of us to play again and to our horror we had already been through 90% of the DVD questions! We spent [$$$] on this game and basically got to enjoy it once! This game was, in our opinion, a waste of money."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this game with high hopes for the DVD Interaction (especially after purchasing Scene It). All they did was make the ""piece"" question on DVD. They, to my disappoinment, really did not *use* the DVD capabilities."
5,This game is great fun !!!!!!!,"This game is a lot of fun. Some friends brought it over last night and we played 3 times in a row. The games go a lot quicker and the dvd part is really cool, you get clues to the answer and if the other people playing don't have the color pie they have a chance to guess for the pie as well.I liked it so much I am online buying it for myself."
3,Fun to play the first time but.....,"We had a great time playing the game the first time. But the second time we played, the pie questions that you play the dvd for were all repeated. We had to go through all the ones we had the first time in order to get new ones. It took forever."
1,"If I could rate it lower, I would.","The lameness of the DVD portion of this game is actually shocking to me. I love Trivial Pursuit. I couldn't believe that they would put such a shoddy product out there. It looks like crap, the questions are really retarded (many of them given away by the end), and the first (and only) game we played resulted in MANY, MANY repeated questions. If I see that clip from Animal House EVER again, I may go mad. It came up no less than 10 times in one hour. What were they thinking???? We returned the game the next day."
2,Buy a non-DVD version!!!,"The DVD questions in the ""to win"" section repeated themselves during the FIRST time my wife and I played this game! I seems as if the folks at Parker Brothers never played this game more than one time, or they would know that the DVD is rendered useless after the first one or two games. Isn't the DVD the reason you go out and buy this version???Other than that, Trivial pursuit is a great game as always, but this DVD version is a real LOSER.Go out and buy Trivial Pursuit - just not the DVD Pop Culture game..."
2,Don't buy this.,"This has the potential to be a fun game. The first time I played it, it was great, but the second time we had almost every pie question on the DVD repeated and you can't skip past the one's you've already answered. After playing the game for the 3rd time we had already been through the entire box of cards. This game only has one dvd and one box of cards that won't last through three full games. This was a big waste of money for a game I only got to play three times."
2,SO-SO,I DONT LIKE THIS GAME AT ALL!YES IT IS EDUCATIONALBUT NOT FOR A KID THIS IS FOR 16+ AGEWHEN I FIRST SAW IT IT SEEMED GOOD BUT THEN I PLAYED IT AND...SPLAT ITS BAD!I WOULD NOT BUY THIS UNLES YOU ARE 16 OVER
1,I DISAGREE WITH AMAZON STARS,Reading the reviews plus the fact that you can only play this game once - it definitely does not deserve that many stars.
2,Worst Trivial Pursuit Game to Date,"Big dissapointment. Trivial Pursuit is our favorite game and we love to keep up with pop culture, but we will probably never play this game again. The questions are really off the wall and you can't play twice without getting the same video questions. Played with several groups of people - parents (in their 50's) and friends in their 20's - no one liked the game."
1,REPEAT OFFENDER,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. THE CARDS ARE OK, HOWEVER THE DVD REPEATS QUESTIONS OVER AND OVER. THERE IS NO STRATEGY TO WIN WHEN YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER. AFTER THE SECOND TIME PLAYING WE SAW QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD ALREADY ANSWERED. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME FOR ANYONE."
4,Fun Game but the sports are too hard,"My husband and I really had alot of fun playing this game. However, the sports questions were too hard for me and the game questions were about video games. I think they should have made the sports and games catergory with some questions geared also to those who don't watch much sports or play video games. There are other games beside video games. But other than that we enjoyed it alot!"
5,I Never Get Tired Of This Book,"Most people don't get this book. It is a very heart felt book. What most people don't realise about it is that Charles Fredrick Worth is an actual Person in our worlds history. When it talks about all of the clothing for different people, he actually did make those pieces. He was the man who was completely resposable for changing our ideals of fashion in todays society. If it weren't for him we may not have the fashions that we have today. In the edition that I have read there is a page that says that Charles Worth's grandson helped get the facts straight. I read this book at least 5 times a year. The way that Ms. Laker intertwined the other peoples lives together makes you feel like you are really there with them. Don't just read these reviews and make your decision based apon there words. Read the book for yourself and then decide. Just remember that some of these people really did exist and that they helped make our life what it is today."
5,Excellent historical/living-history fiction,"Don't hesitate to read ""Banners of Silk"" because others have dubbed it a romance. The male/female interaction is secondary to this historical fiction in which we get a clear first-hand view of the beginnings of haute couture in Napoleonic France. It is more a study of the people and class system of the time and location than a romance. I do not generally read ""romance novels"" and I loved Banners of Silk."
3,"Three stars only because I was happy they made a movie, otherwise, two","If this had been any other movie, I would have found it flat and unfulfilling. Lots of promise, but no delivery. What else were they going to do with the movie but have yet another fight between Carrie and Big? And break up Samantha and Smith? Surely they could have found some more interesting (and plausible) plot points? Big is a captain of industry, yet in this movie, he's painted as indecisive and vacillating. He's always been that way to some extent, but in this movie, they've exaggerated that characteristic to inject some drama into an otherwise weak plot.The interaction between the friends felt somewhat forced at times. Still, I was happy to see the movie do well, if for no other reason than they'll be making another movie. And I hope it's much, much better than this one!"
3,I'm disappointed!,"I have viewed this storyline many times so I almost know it by heart.what surprised me was the editing which left out many important events;some of my favorites.I felt drained after viewing this because it was unsatisfying as it usually is to me.If the show had been shown in its entirety,it would have been great but the poor editing and deletions left me feeling cheated.Now I have to purchase the reat thing."
4,sweet movie,"If you loved the series, this movie is a sweet continuation- it's fun to see the characters a few years later."
3,Sex and the City,"The movie was OK, but the soundtrack wasn't really what we expected. It was a little too obnoxious at times."
4,Kleenex Please,"A glass of wine, a blanket to curl up with, a quiet house and this movie will make for a perfect 'in' evening. Being a ""sex and the city"" junkie, I saw this at the show when it first came out. I enjoy this DVD as much the second, third and fourth time around. For anyone having the collection of DVD's, this rounds out the series and makes it complete."
2,"Confession of a Shop-a-Holic Does ""The City"" Way Better","I was HBO deprived so I never watched the show when it came out. Watched some of the episodes in syndication, and I thought was OK for 1/2 hour episodes.The episodes changed each time, but this movie way too shallow for 2 hours. I love NYC even though only visited on business. The show did have many episodes in cool locations around NYC. The movie disappointing in that as well.If you want a movie with more depth, great shots of NYC... get Confession of a Shop-a-Holic, or the original Sex series.Kim Cartall was great in the Ice Princess ! She needs to dump the city and move forward! Same as the other actresses whom I respect in other roles."
1,junk,"I don't know why I bought this - couldn't get through it - ok for playing guitar along plus fast forward but still, too silly. superficial."
4,A fun movie for the mature audience.,"Sex and the City - The Movie (Widescreen Edition)I didn't expect to like this movie and was pleasantly surprised. It had all the same emotion and fun of the TV series. The stars remained true to the characters they had created for television and we watched them grow into their new lives and still remaining best friends. The men in their lives understood this sisterhood and embrassed it, therefore becoming integral to these women. All said I have watched this movie three or four times so far and all of my girl friends have equally enjoyed it. Give it a 4 star, hands down."
5,Great Movie,"I am a huge fan of the SATC show so I was a bit worried when they announced they were making a movie but it ended up being great. I am starting to think that they can do no wrong, but who knows. The movie follows where the show left off to an extent except it is a few years later. I thought that it was well done and would recommend it to anyone who liked the show or to anyone who wants a refreshing chick movie."
4,great except for one glitch,"the item received was in great condition and i loved it except for one thing. in the picture book, one of the pages were kind of stuck together at the bottom and after trying to carefully pull it apart, some of the picture on one side of the page stuck to the other leaving a huge white streak of ripped paper. good thing it wasn't one of my favorite pictures."
1,Shouldn't have been a movie...,"I've recently gotten into the TV series so I decided to check out the movie, despite poor reviews from my peers. The movie is nowhere near the quality of the show. The way the movie has been written is much different from the show, especially the narration which doesn't have the same creative insights Carrie usually has. On top of this its not that funny, mainly because Samantha doesn't act like a slut in the show (she sleeps with only 1 guy, very unSamantha-like). Everything in the movie was very unoriginal to me and unrealistic so I can't recommend this film at all."
3,Okay Movie,"It's a decent movie, but it wasn't as good as the television series, and it's not as good as the 'Sex and the City 2' movie. However, you need to watch this first movie to get all of the jokes in the sequel. You may want to just rent this one instead of purchasing."
2,Froth of nothing,"I really didn't like this movie. Chris Noth wasn't as good as in the show and it was really empty. Carrie had gotten a simple dress for her wedding to Big and Candace Bergen had talked her into becoming the Last Single Woman in Manhattan. With the photo ops and such came a gorgeous dress that Carrie decided to wear and the wedding got way out of hand. She wore a green feather in her veil. I'm not sure what that was about. Miranda was whining about Steve being unfaithful. No surprise there. Charlotte FINALLY got a child. Samantha was the same self-centered woman she always was.If you want to see it, rent it from Netflix like I did. Don't waste your money. It isn't worth it to own it. This is a one time viewing."
1,Very disappointing!,"I just can't get over how people actually liked this movie? I am a huge fan of the series, I own the entire series, and thought that the finale of the series was fantastic! So why did they feel that they had to make a movie? First of all, they crammed way too much into the movie. It was like they were trying to do a whole season in the span of one movie. I don't want to give too much away, and if you haven't seen it don't read any further...The whole wedding bothered me so much! Carrie deserved the big fancy wedding! Also, do you really think that Steve would have ever cheated on Miranda? Give me a break! The whole Mexico/Honeymoon was a complete waste of time, and come on, Carrie's ""depression"" was way overdone. I wish this movie was never made, I want to remember the fantastic series, not this mess of a movie!"
1,Awful,This person sold me a junk dvd that I believe to be a bootleg. I tried to contact them twice to resolve the problem and they never contacted me back. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!
5,Sex and the city,I never would watch it. But my wife enjoyed it that was the goal was buying it for her birthday. I did not want to see it going to a movie theather so once I knew it was coming out it fell near her birthday so it worked out great.
4,The Girls are BACK!!!!! and I'm loving it!!!,"I loved watching this movie. For those of you who thought it was tacky, get a life and a sense of humor to go with it!!! This movie is pretty much harmless. I found it funny, fascinating, and stylish, just like the original series. Sure this isn't gonna win any Emmys, but the good movies never really do. I'm sure i'll be watching this over and over again, because it's a good laugh and a movie that will have you thinking about your own life from time to time. In one way or another, we all somehow relate to the characters and/or situations in this movie. We can learn something from Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda. Nice movie."
4,Get the tissue ready!,"The movie has a few slow points however the story line is good. I've watched it about 7 times and each time ""Mr. Big"" jilts Carrie, I cry. I've seen the second movie, too, but don't recommend it."
5,Great Movie,"The show was great, and the movie was a great tie in to the show. I didn't want Carrie to end up with Big since I loved Aiden, and then after what he does to her on their wedding day made it worse.... but thats what a good show does. It gets you sucked in and makes you think the characters are real. I loved it!!"
4,great movie!,"If you are a fan of the show you will like this movie! It picks up where the show left off, which is exactly what I wanted it to do."
5,A FINAL TO A FINAL,"I love Sex and the City. I am a huge fan. I own all six seasons and anxiously awaited the movie's big day view. I thought it moved a tad bit slowly, in the beginning, but the plot was good and interesting enough to keep your attention. If you've followed the series, you know, it wouldn't have been Sex and the City if everything went smooth and peachy with no drama on Carrie''s end. For those of you who didn't enjoy the movie, oh well. I felt the scripts were well written and the scenes were very realistic. Definitely a great movie to add to your collection. If you're a fan or just want to sit back and watch, as my friend call it, a great chic flic', get this movie, it's worth it."
2,Sex in the City-Movie,I love the movie but I didn't get what I ordered. I specifically ordered the special edition of the movie but got the regular one. Disappointing!!!
5,Sex in the City lives up to its reputation!,The DVD came in the order I expected it to. I was very satisfied with my purchase and pleased to get it for a price that was well below what I had seen in retail stores.
3,Return of Carrie and the girls!,"I loved this show and still watch the DVD's or catch episodes on Youtube or TBS. I kept saying to myself how I much I missed the show. And was excited when the movie was green lit. The movie picks up four years after the show ended. I thought Samantha had the least to do and as payback for delaying the making of the movie, was made to get fat. No, not sure if that's true or not, but makes you wonder. Charlotte didn't have much to add either, except squeal, get pregnant and poop her pants. Miranda had some great scenes with Carrie & Steve. I liked the scenes between Carrie and her assistant. The movie was a bit long but it was good seeing the girls again, and of course all the high fashion. It wouldn't be SATC without the high fashion. I didn't like the bit parts for characters Stanford & Anthony. And what happened to Marcus?? There are some hits and misses with the movie, most SATC fans will enjoy it."
4,Great Girls Night Movie,"My girlfriend and I went to IMAX when this movie was released - making it a girls night out activity. For those of you that watched Sex and the City it is a continuation of the television show and tied up the loose ends - though it would be great if there were more movies as they get older. There were some really sad moments and some that had the whole theater (which was filled with women) in stitches - but I won't give those moments away.While it may not be Oscar worthy and the writing may not be win any literary awards, in my opinion it provided something better. It was familiar and comforting, warm and entertaining. Seeing it with a girlfriend makes it a terrific experience and one I recommend that you do. Purchase the movie, send husbands/boyfriends away, make some deliciously fattening food and watch this with a friend/friends you love (which of course negates all the calories!!)."
1,"Oh, No No NOooo.....","Awful. Oh what an awful movie. Did they have the same writers?? Director??? Are you Sure??? Oh this was Such a stinker.The tv show was infinitely smarter, wittier, sharper, more romantic, more lovely, better acted, ....on and on and On.I should have walked out. Oh! Good Point: The popcorn was good. : 9A Sequel?? Fool me Once..."
1,TV show was far better,Without giving away the ending its not not at all believable. Going to the middle east Sam does a few things to upset those who she wants to do business with. The character is far smarter than that. Some of the cloths and sets are very nice but it was a serious disappointlemnt. Not as good as the tv show save your money.
2,Not as good as the series,I really enjoyed the series and thought I might like this movie. I was wrong. I was so bad that I don't even like to watch the series anymore.
4,A good entertaining movie but....,A good entertaining movie but could do without the explicit sex scenes. Somethings should be left to the imagination.
3,Non watcher,"I had rarely seen the TV show but I enjoyed this movie! You don't need to be a show follower to watch this movie, although I'm sure it helps."
5,Sex And the City: The Wedding,"If you are a fan of Sex And the City HBO productions, then you will enjoy this special wedding edition.The beautiful wedding album contains fabulous photos with the dvds. Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Mr. Big (Chris Nolte) finally marry."
1,Bummer in the City,"Having enjoyed the television series, I was afraid, from all the hype, that the movie would be a big disappointment. Well, I couldn't have been more right. The thing that makes the TV series work is that the friendship among the women is stronger than anything else; all the superficial stuff is just icing. In the movie, the strongest thing is the massive assault of designer label product placement; it's all superficial stuff and nothing else. It's like one long, annoying commercial. And by the way, the movie is all Carrie all the time; Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha -- far more interesting characters -- have almost nothing to do. The men are beyond an afterthought. The movie is also bizarrely, gratuitously crass. I almost walked out of the theatre. Beyond a dud, this movie is offensive to human intelligence. I hear they're making another.... yikes."
4,"enjoyable, but socially irresponsible","Sex in the city is a result of women's lib that began in the sixties (or is that cities?) that resulted in all sorts of problems for modern women in relationships, but also resulted in a lot of positive steps for women in the workplace.This is the result - a movie and show that some women in today's culture can relate to. And this is why this show is popular - it glamorizes something that many women can relate to. On the other hand, you could argue, that it may promote selfishness, unrealistic expectations about life in general, sexual promiscuity, and may push women into this type of behavior by making them think they are prima donnas because they deserve the best in life.Regardless of the social content, I found this film to be enjoyable.. even if it was a little more pornographic than I was expecting (not saying I'm complaining of course... but still). Read some of henry Mackow on the subject and his take on the show.. [...]"
2,Sex and the City - The Movie,"Not bad, but glad I didn't pay to go to the movie theater to see it. Good to watch once."
1,Don't buy for the digital copy!!!!,"We recently purchased the Blu-ray BECAUSE it is listed as including a digital copy. When we tried to retrieve it, we were informed that the option for the digital download had expired in 2009. Great movie otherwise.."
1,NEVER ORDER FROM THEM!,"After waiting a while for my movie to come in, it did not work!! It was a fake copy and dvd player refused to play it!!"
5,Quick to get,"Nice price and received quick for a ""Favorite Things"" party. It is a favorite of mine and I want to share"
3,was a little blurry,The movie is great but the rental Amazon has displays as a little blurry :( Be forewarned before you rent it for $3.00.
5,Fantastic Fun Movie..What Happened To The Bloopers,I just loved this movie what a great fun movie for a girls night out so I was really excited to purchase this and was so disappointed that there were no bloopers and outtakes in this DVD....especially a 2 disc Special Edition copy. It was clear these woman had a blast filming this and we all thought the bloopers would have been a hoot to watch....sadly none. Also the box states extra film footage of Fergie singing...well if you blink you will miss that also as it was seconds long. Still a fantastic movie for your collection.
4,It's really over...,"This movie was bitter sweet. Bitter b'c SATC is really over and sweet b'c we got one more taste of the girls. Although, I was alittle disappointed in Carrie and where was Sam. Watch and you'll see..."
4,Thoroughly Entertaining,"The girls are back and achieve an amazing task. Bringing a televison show to the big screen rarely works well and here it far surpasses all expectation. Scenery - amazing, clothes - amazing, dialogue - amazing. The plot is inventive and fully worthy of full screen treatment. All the girls shine and have their moments. Whoever is your favorite, you will be happy with the results. We also have the addition of Jennifer Hudson here and a great addition she is. She fits in admirably and shows her full versatility beyond DREAMGIRLS.The movie will make you laugh and cry. It is big and extravagant - exactly what you would expect. Sometimes it does seem like an extended episode of the show but that is a good thing. It just shows how much it is staying true to itself.They say another one could be in the making and I cannot wait. Grab a drink, your friends and have a GREAT time !!!"
5,Sex & the City Movie,"Great Movie! Saw it twice in theatres, had to bring it home! You laugh and then you are pushed to tears! Really plays of the tv show and no gaps took place. Well directed!"
2,Yuck in the City,"Over acted, actresses too old to play their parts. Please, Samantha can get over herself anytime. Fifty years old and still playing the I'm hot and horny teenage tramp role? I just didn't buy it. Those STUPID hats that Carrie wears? Forget it. It's like they are little girls playing dressup. I wish I had saved my money. Live and learn. The people I let borrow it said it was a waste of their time also. SJParker has made enough money. She looked haggerd, and her hair always looks oily for some reason. Time to retire, sweetie and retire to the good life. People are already talking about you. Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis Still have a lot to give. They are beautiful, and act very well. They aren't older trying to act like they are still in their twenties. Kim...If it were not for Sex, you would only , maybe be remembered for a ditzy cop, and a manniquin, and it doesn't take much acting for either role."
5,"""I am humilated!!""","Sex and the City - The Movie is absolutely delightful. Sarah Jessica Paker slips back into perfect ease as writer Carrie Bradshaw, the rest of the cast definitely left a good impression on me expect Jennifer Hudson, not a big fan of her work. This film is much more dramatic and that's a good thing, I was hoping the movie verison wouldn't be fluffy or superficial. The writing is still top notch thanks to Michael Patrick King, the look of the film is great as well. I highly recommend this gem of a movie, you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!!"
5,Good entertainment,"First, I find it hilarious that of the 4 reviews that give this just one star, 3 of them are written by men. The other seems to be a female of dubious maturity. This is entertainment people. Nothing more, nothing less. I can easily see why some would be disappointed in it, if they've sat with the series from the beginning. I, for one, enjoyed it, for what it was. Something fun to watch that killed some time on a Saturday afternoon. I felt they kept the characters true to the series. They could so easily have wrapped up a happily ever after for everyone but we are left with Samantha being... well.. Samantha. Of all the characters I wanted to see change for the better, she was the one. But again, I fully understand why she did not. I will buy the DVD when it's released, mostly because I have the whole set from of the series anyway. And because I will watch it again as it will be worth the time."
3,It's okay,I was a huge fan of the show and was a bit disappointed because this first movie is not as great
4,"""Sex"" Holds Its Own on the Big Screen","Writer-director Michael Patrick King should be commended for reviving the popular HBO series as a legitimate theatrical feature - rather than creating an extended episode. ""Sex and the City"" (2008) emerges as a perceptive romantic comedy-drama that expands the TV-show parameters while maintaining the vital chemistry between Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis. Judging by the phenomenal box-office success, loyal fans have not been disappointed. However, the overall film can proudly stand on its own merits."
2,yawn,"I've only seen the series on hotel televisions late at night, but even those few eps that I've seen seemed much smarter and funnier than this film. I actually dozed off about halfway through."
2,Beware of Escapism Overdose,"This movie is like a Sex and the City marathon, and the experience makes you appreciate why Sex and the City was just a half hour show. It's best to watch this movie in small doses, a bit each evening to avoid a coma. Carrie Bradshaw and her pals can get tiresome after the first forty or fifty minutes - the characters are too ME, ME, ME. We may love them, but even old friends can wear out their welcome. Jennifer Hudson is a breath of fresh air as Carrie's assistant; I found myself wishing she had more screen time.Without a doubt, the fashions and NYC glamour are fun, but who can really afford those Manolo Blahnik shoes? Or wear them and walk at the same time??Although worth seeing just to say been there, done that, there isn't much reason to actually purchase this movie unless you're a big fan of the series. I've noticed that there are always multiple copies available for free at the local public library."
5,Love it!,I loved the movie anyway when it came out in theaters. This is a lot better because it has additional footage that I personally thought they should have left in the movie. Will watch over and over again!
2,PORNO - more sex than in Zack and Miri make a porno movie,"I never watched the show before because I just couldn't get into it. Maybe I'm too young or it just wasn't my cup of tea. Well after everyone kept telling me it was such a fantastic movie (I should have seen the signs since this was coming from single 30 somethings), I finally caved and bought the movie on black Friday. Most of the film is about clothes, clothes, and more clothes. Seeing Carie in her underwear was disturbing since she looks anorexic. The sex scene with the full frontal nudity was definitely not expected. I know its called ""sex and the city"" but I wasn't aware this was amateur porn. A rating of NC-17 would have been more appropriate. I want my $[...] back."
1,Disappointing,"I'm so glad I didn't stand in long lines waiting to see SATC when it premiered in movie theaters. This film was a gigantic let down, after too much hype to begin with. Basically the film was another vehicle for SJP to wear some hideous designer clothes. Other than that, the film lacked substance and I can't imagine them planning on yet ANOTHER SATC movie! I think I'll pass on that one."
1,SHOCK AND DISAPPOINTMENT!!!,"THESE ARE THE ONLY 2 WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS MOVIE, SHOCK AND DISAPPOINTMENT. I AM A BIG FAN OF THE SHOW AND CANNOT BELIEVE HOW DISORGANIZED THIS PLOT WAS. IT WAS LIKE A BIG POINTLESS RUNAROUND. IT WAS ALL FOR NOTHING, NOTHING GAINED, NOTHING LEARNED, NO INSIGHT, NO CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, NO PROGRESSION IN THEIR LIVES. THEY ACTUALLY DID THE OPPOSITE AND REGRESSED. I HOPE THE WRITERS OF THIS MOVIE READ THIS AND TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION IF THEY ARE TO MAKE A SEQUEL. I FEEL LIKE RETURNING THE DVD FOR WASTING MY TIME AND MONEY."
3,Good...not great,"ive watched the show in just about its entirety, and the movie doesnt disappoint. Its basically a show developed as a movie.. which i guess is to be exected. HD quality excellent and nice addition of digital copy for really no extra cost."
1,My DVD died in the middle! Never saw the end.,My dvd died when they went to Mexico. I can't return it because it's already opened. This pretty much sucks and I won't be buying any more videos from Amazon. Thanks for asking!
1,Spare us the wrinkles,"Pathetic, wishful-thinking movie for older women. To add any credibility to this movie the actresses would have to be at leat 20 years younger."
3,3 stars because it's more than 2,"Not wanting to be stoned by a pack of angry stiletto ninjas, I made this review on the run. After the movie I thought was a porno, I stood up and was very disappointed at the plot. Who cares about your life, was my initial reaction but than I had not noticed how loud I said it. The room was on fire with pumped up women shouting inanities about crack and heroine. I tried the pokemon method but it didn't work. Overall, I had to get out of there and this is why I give this movie only 3 stars."
5,Loved It!,I really loved watching the girls in a full length movie. The fashion was great and every one lived up to their full reputation...except I expected more uumph from Jennifer Hudson.
3,nothing at all special,"The movie itself is fine as it's just the TV series writ large. There's enough of the usual cast of characters but the 2+ hr. length does mean it drags especially after the 1st hour. Definitely a lot better than expected as often TV series jumping to the big screen have trouble making that jump.The problem is the DVD extras are sadly lacking. All we get is a director's commentary. You'd think with the fashions-a-go-go and the whole ""will/won't they do a movie"" controversy that there could have been more extras on here."
1,Disappointing movie,"I was sadly disappointed in this movie. I would think it would show the continuing lives of the characters as they got older in a positive way. Instead it was a doom and gloom movie. Everything seeemed to go wrong. This was supprising after the end of the series that showed things going so well and open hearts. They seemed to lack compassion. I was sorry that I went to the movie theatre and actually paid to see this movie. Everyone is different but I cannot for the life of me see why more positive things were not in the movie and the growing lives of the characters. Instead they seemed to move backwards in their growth. The series, ""Sex and the City"" is by far much better."
5,Is John still alive?,"I put this on and it sounds like John recently went into a studio somewhere and made this album. If he were alive, this is what I'd expect him to sound like now and even the songs sound like new! John may have produced these recordings some time ago but the material on this CD fits perfectly in with the best of todays progressive- rock. His recording of ""Serve Yourself"" is a real kick. If your a Beatle fan and John fan, this is the album to have. Thank you Yoko- wonderful selections!"
3,"Almost nothing new, but nice","What to say? If you don't like listening to alternative versions of songs you know, don't buy this. Anyway it's quite nice."
5,"If you want to hear good music, buy this album","This album is amazing. I would reccomend it to anyone who likes real rock and roll. It sounds like an ex-Beatle who is doing his own thing and you can hear how he influenced The Beatles' music. The CD opens with a killer song, ""Losing You"", and I have to say that ""god"" is the most nihilistic piece of music I have ever heard. I actually like these versions of ""Working Class Hero"" and ""Imagine"" better than the released versions although I may be in the minority. Wonsaponatime may not be for everyone, but it is a true picture of Rock and Roll."
4,Interesting,"A chance to hear Lennon fairly relaxed here, and some of the alternate takes are better than the masters in my view (I'm Loosing You, Grow Old With Me), some are pretty awful but thats mainly because I have never taken to them in the first place, but the album is worth listening to nontheless, esp.. one fav of mine 'I Don't Wanna Face It', which offers a frustrating glimpse of what Lennon would have been like in the 80s."
2,royal sovereign coin sorter is fast but jambs a lot,Maybe I am expecting too much but it seems like jambs every 4-5 minutes or less. It is kind of frustrating when you have to keep starting over. It seems durable enough however.
4,Solid; It really works,Sorted and wrapped a pile of coins that had been collecting around the house for years. Machine worked very well. Occasionally it would mis-sort a penny into the nickel stack. The only real problem was that I had a few dollar coins that I accidently dumped in the sorter. They were too large to come out through any of the sort portals so they just banged around inside the machine. I had to take it apart to get them out (remove 4 screws). That's the only reason I don't give this 5 stars. I'm happy with the machine and glad I bought it.
4,easy cash,"This product worked nicely for what I needed it for. I wrapped $1,000.00 in quarters only.If you don.t try to pack as much coins in at one time it works. The only problem I had was that the wrappers are to long so you cannot fill up to the required amount. I had to manually add 2 coins to complete the roll. The machine still made my job easier."
1,Sorts coins into the wrong slots,"I bought this in the hope that it would save me time in processing the misc jars of coins I've accumulated. I ended up rolling the coins manually as this machine consistently dropped dimes into the penny slot (between pennies) and nickels into the quarters slot (between quarters).To work for me, I coin sorter should1) Be accurate2) Be easy to useThis machine is neither. The ease of use issue relates to knowing if you have enough coins in a roll to ensure a proper count. There were multiple times where I couldn't tell if I was one coin under or over the proper number and ended out dumping the roll on the counter and counting by hand.As I said above, I ended up rolling the rest of my thousand-plus coins by hand as I couldn't rely on this machine. I suggest either buying something much more high-end or buying a simple manual counting tool, which is what I'm about to do now that I've returned this useless sorter."
4,Clean out those couch cushions!,"What a great little gadget. The only negative is that if you put too much change in at once (more than a handful or two), the machine gets bogged down and starts throwing coins in the wrong slots. The paper refills fit perfectly in the plastic holders and make counting a cinch! I highly recommend this sorter for home use!"
4,Works well,The coin-sorter works very well and when used correctly doesn't jam at all. It also works fast and accurate.
1,Piece of junk,"This is not worth $20, let alone the almost $60 price. I placed nothing but dimes in the sorter, twice, and both times the count was incorrect, sorting 40 to 45 coins into the dime tube rather than the 50 that is supposed to be placed in dime tubes. If I wanted to count coins, I would not have bought this stupid thing. In fact, the WHOLE purpose was to avoid counting the damn things. I will return this junk for a refund."
2,received defective unit,"I liked the price and bought the unit because the reviews I read said it was reliable and didn't break down like the cheap battery operated units on the market. I plugged in the unit and put mostly pennies and some quarters, dimes and nickels in the bin. The pennies went in the penny and nickel slots, the dimes went in the dime and penny slots. I emptied the sorter and started over with just a handful of coins since I thought that I may have put too many coins in the machine. The same thing happened and some of the coins disappeared in the machine. The users manual did not help. I returned the machine to Amazon with no hassle or cost and decided to just sort my coins the old fashioned way."
4,Good.,So far so good. I've never had it jam on me and the overflow coins are easy to reinsert into it.
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"Jams easily, not accurate, coins get stuck in housing (had to take the bottom off to get the coins out) coin rolls become full and coins flow over into tray (have to count them to make sure each roll is right - not what I wanted to do in the first place), coins got stuck under rotating mechanism and caused a loud clicking sound (once again, had to disassemble to get them out), don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk!!"
4,Met our expectations,This sorter was as promised and functioned reliably. It is being used as a sorter sometimes and as a feeder to a penny sorter and it just does all we expected at a reasonable speed. No jams either.
4,Very Good Product,"I purchased the Royal Sovereign Fast Sort CO-1000 for a family member. He always has spare chage. This product was not only helpful in sorting the coins... but we had no idea how much money he had in spare change. It is a very good product. I really like the anti-jam feature... but it makes quite a bit of noise(the only reason I took a star off its score). We did use coin wrappers. For all the coins we sorted, not too many missed their tubes and landed in the overflow tray."
1,Piece of Junk,"I received machine in timely fashion, put in my first helping of change and whamit jams. no way to disassembleit. No way to clear any problems. Total Crap."
4,Solid product,"Great sorter!! Most reliable sorter I've ever had. My gripes are minor, mainly you need to remove 3 screws to take the cover off to remove odd coins it can't sort. There is an overflow bin, where coins can fall if the tubes are full, but half dollars/dollar coins will just rattle around inside it until you remove the cover and take them out. Otherwise works great!"
1,Fast Break,"My coin sorter broke in about five weeks. First the tray jammed open, then bits of plastic fell out. After the plastic bits came out the tray would slide but nothing would line up and work. I collect only pocket change from my husband and myself. During the time that it worked I put together seven rolls of coins, so I don't believe that I over worked it. I would not encourage you to buy this coin sorter, I will not buy another like it."
2,fussy coin sorter,"I initially was pleased with this product. However, after using it for 2 weeks, the penny counter doesn't work and jams up causing pennies to fly into all sorting tubes. At this point, I have to sort out the pennies and use it only for silver coins. As pennies are the most common coin dropped into the charity container, it has taken some of the quickness of getting this project done. We are a non-profit so I didn't want to spend a thousand dollars on a coin sorter, but I would have selected a different one that could handle the load."
2,Buy only if not intending to wrap coins,"The coin holder often only catches 49 out of 50 needed pennies for a roll forcing you to count and see if it missed one. It would be very convenient if there were dashes to tell you how many coins are in each wrapper. Thats just my Two Cents (Pun intended.). But all kidding aside, When it gets clogged all of the coins shoot out of all of the wholes but this only happens on the rare occasion in gets clogged.ErIc LaNg"
2,Not so hot,"This coin sorter would be better if it were accurate. I put in the exact number of coins for one role of each quarters, nickles, dimes, pennies... and it underfilled every one by two or three coins. So it's pretty useless."
4,Fun and Easy to Use,"I bought this product as a present for my parents as they have a lot of loose change that they keep around the house. Out of all the products, this one seemed to be the best fit and indeed, for a reasonable price, it was easy to use. My parents really enjoyed it. My only concern is that my parents still feel the need to count the coins to make sure they are the right amount given that even when the coins are filled to the top, there are sometimes still one or two missing. It kind of defeats the purpose in a way, but I'm not sure if it's because they are meticulous or if it is a product defect. Nonetheless, they have enjoyed the product and it has served a purpose of them being more organized about their change."
4,Coin Sorter,Product works just as advertised. No jams so far. I eveluated other products and chose the Royal CO-1000 and am happy that I did.Dennis
2,disappointing,power switch is cheap and unreliable. only works some of the time. nice design otherwise. appeared to be jam free.
1,Doesn't work!,The coins are suppose to slide down shoots into the wrappers. Doesn't happen. The majority of coins miss the wrapper and fall into the tray. It's a constant reloading and there's no counting possible. I can't believe such a bad product would even be made!
2,Not the most reliable,I had to removed money to be sure the correct about was in the paper container. As filling the paper container some of the coins would flip out
1,Stopped working after $10 in quarters through it!!!,"I purchased this coin sorter after reading the reviews on here. I have appx $400 is change that I wanted to sort and place into coin wrappers as this models main purpose is. I was very disappointed that after only putting through $10 in quarters ($2 at a time), the motor seized up and it stopped working. It is very cheap in it's build quality and I will not buy another one. I will seek out another brand and move on. I hope this review helps others looking at this model!Pros: NothingCons: noisy, cheap build, motor not strong enough to handle $2 in quarters at a time"
3,Works as intended,Too often there is spillover where the coins don't fall directly into the cylinder and instead into the overflow chamber.
4,Great Product,Have been using this Orange Oil Spray for a couple of months and love it. The only problem is the nossle drips and can make a bit of a mess.Howard Products Ors016 Orange Oil Spray
4,They work well,"The purpose of these are to relocate your mirrors to the frame of the Jeep from the door, so you can remove the doors and still have mirrors. They work great when the doors are off! The only drawback is when the doors are on. The right mirror is hard to see unless you position it correctly. And even when it is positioned where you can see it, you have to be careful not to open the door to hard because it might swing into the mirror. I have a few small dents in my door from hitting the mirror. After playing around with it for a little bit, you should be able to configure it so it doesn't hit the door, and you can still see it while driving."
2,blocked view,"after relocating the mirrors to the windshield frame the passenger side mirrior is blocked by the windshield frame, making the mirror useless."
4,Pretty good,Good sturdy product. The mirror on the right side becomes almost unusable with the doors on. Doors off...perfect. Not a perfect product but still glad I purchased the product.
3,Great!!! but not so much!,"Bought these for my 99 wrangler, they are great, fit good and look nice. However they only allow viewing of the passanger mirror if you are running with no doors or half doors. The upper doors obstruct the mirror view and you cannot move the mirror to a visible location except to reinstall them on the door mount!So if you run no doors all the time then buy them! But if you need to run doors then you may want to go another way!"
2,no hablo ingles,"no instructions, used wrong torx screw remover and stripped bolts, tried drillng out, but that didn't work, how hard would it have been to say remove these 2 't40 bolts' and mount brackets on, CANNOT be used with doors attached, passenger mirror cannot been seen, good idea, but not great, a little dissappointed"
4,needs work,"We bought this for our 3 year old and I agree it is a fantastic learning tool and she loves to play with it, however; it is difficult for a 3 year old to change the books or flip the book over. You have to line up the book and press the ring binder into the grooves, not easy for a kid, also if the book is not on correctly it won't work properly."
4,"good product, not perfect","We bought the pink one for my 3.5 year old daughter for Christmas.Pros:-educational-fun, cheap books like spongebob, and dora-volume adjusts-cute sounds and phrases in the books that entertain kidsCons-the on/off button is right where my daugher rests her forearm. she keeps accidentally turning the leapPad off and then gets very frustrated-when you press the ""on"" button it takes a couple of seconds for the sound to come on. since my daughter doesn't hear the ""on"" sounds right away she pushes the on/off button again thinking it didn't come on, inadvertantly turning the leappad OFF. She ends up pushing the button like 50 times before I have to intervene."
2,Not Worth It!,"I broke my normal rule of 'No Toys with Batteries' because of the lure of the LeapPad educational value... Big Mistake.My kids want to play with this toy but it NEVER works right. First of all our unit shuts off every 2-3 minutes (with new batteries) regardless if someone is using it or not. I like an auto shutoff but the kids quickly get frustrated and walk away.Cartridges... ugg. I would say about 25% of the time I can not get this unit to recognize the cartridge ""That's Not a LeapPad Cartridge"" is a frequent error. So often it is reverting to the non-cartridge game even when my kids think they have gotten another book installed. Another source of frustration.My kids want to play with it... but it is sadly on the shelf waiting for the next garage sale.FYI - my kids are 2.5 and 4.5yr old. They can both turn on the computer and load their favorite games on their own and are quite computer savvy. This toy is not beyond their means of operating properly it is just too finicky IMO."
3,Helping my baby sister,"I enjoy sitting on the living room rug and helping my sister (20 months old) play with this. She is WAY TOO young to do this by herself -- after all, it DOES say for children ages 3 and older -- but with my help she is learning!I was saddened to read the review below that said electronic toys are not good for kids. My sister gets PLENTY of playtime from me, my Mom and Dad and other sister. But we have all noticed that there are times she doesn't want 'human contact' --and that's where the Leap Pad comes in handy. And the giggles we get when she makes the toy 'talk' are worth it every time!!I believe that most things are okay for children -- IN MODERATION! It's the same principle as using a TV as a babysitter. That's not right, but what is so awful about her watching 15 minutes of a Winnie the Pooh cartoon? She enjoys it and then walks away when it's over."
4,"Good, detailed, and well explained plans.","He's got this book laid out so that each chapter is it's own project. That's a good way to do it to make sure there's enough info to do it right. However, That means that in this relatively fat (expensive) book there are only 10 projects or so. The only project I really liked was the Adirondack chair, the others were too specialized for my simple tastes."
3,Needs more,"Norm is an excellent carpenter/cabinetmaker. I'll leave all of the hand tool/ power tool arguements out of this. Needless to say, carpenters brought about the invention of power tools and a tool is only as good as the user. This all being said, this book is not a perfect book if you want to make furniture like Norm. In defense of the book, it is listed as being a companion to the series, and in my opinion this book is really most useful if you have the show on while using it. I made two projects from the book and while the instructions were decent it was almost under the assumption that I had a tape of the show on as I was working.I have many other woodworking project books and they are all at least as good as this and most are much more clearly written. After watching Norm for all these years and seeing how good a teacher he is I thought the book could have been better."
1,Not a wise choice...,"Sure, there are great actors early in their careers, but it's a very uneventful and disturbing movie. Plenty of bad language. No plot worthy of your time. As for my father and I, it's a ""Two Thumbs Down"" kind of movie."
1,Blu-Ray Review,Absolutely not any better than the 2 disc special edition standard version. Amazon is pissing people off lately.
3,Not Blu-Ray !!,I dont recommended it on Blu-Ray Because its NOT COLOUREDIts On Black&White; ..Raging Bull Is One Of The Greatest Sport Movie everBut Blu-Ray Will Not Make any diffrence in this movieOfcourse Blu-Ray Make HUGE diffrence in the new movies but not in this one !!
2,Just Hoped They Would of Lasted Longer,"I ordered these inflating needles over the summer and hoped they would last the whole time.Goods:Shipped quicklyShipped intactEasy screw in-out useBads:Low quality metalEasily breakableIf you want to avoid snapping your needles, try pulling it out slowly out STRAIGHT!Even though you'll lose a little more air, it's better than having a broken needle."
2,Broken.,Both of the needles broke within a week of initial use. While they are cheap and usually disposable... I used them maybe 5 times each. Seriously?
2,Product is inexpensive.,Needle is alright. Would not need it as the pump ordered with it is not what we actually wanted. Would just keep it in case we'll need item in the future.
1,"Five stars, NOT","I bought this and they broke into the basketball, i expected better queality from spalding."
1,Horrible quality!!!,You can buy these at Wal-Mart for $0.89 per pack. The quality of these needles is terrible. They break very easily and do not last.
5,Speechless...........just speechless. Music from the heart!,"This has to be the best Cd I have ever bought. I love bands like Alice In Chains, Creed, etc., etc. This band has to be one of the best. If not the best. Their lyrics are just to good for you not to buy this cd. Awesome guitar riffs. Awesome drum beats, and awesome song composition. I've noticed MTV has really being kissing Godsmack's ass a whole lot. They should be on their knees begging for Second Coming. I bought the Cd in February and I swear on my grave, that I haven't taken it out of my player yet. I sing in a band, and if I even sound a little like lead vocalist Travis Bracht, I'm happy. Awesome range in his voice. Totally awesome. If I had to pick a favorite, sit down close your eyes and listen to the song ""Unknown Rider"" see how the song changes yet the guitar riff actually makes it feel as if you're riding. WATCH OUT WORLD, FOR THE SECOND COMING!!"
4,I will definitely tell people to buy this CD.,"This is the best new band in this genre of music that I have heard since Alice in Chains. I love the mix of different styles they've incorporated into their songs. The lead singer has a fantastic voice, they are heavy when they need to be heavy, and vice versa. I've not been bored yet by this CD. If you like Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots and Nirvana, with a little Incubus thrown in, then you will LOVE this CD. I think they will be around for a while, and will sell, sell, sell!"
4,Second Coming...Revises the ghosts of Alice in Chains.,"The release of Second Coming's self titled album, brings back the Seattle sound that was vacated by Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. Definitely, an album worth listening to if you enjoy the rugged style rock, edgy vocals, and a blend of techno.-James Espinoza"
5,Seattle's best kept secret,These guys deserve notoriety. 'Heaven is a Loaded Gun' is a clever takeoff on The Beatles' classic 'Happiness is a Warm Gun'. Travis Bracht has soul to spare. The new guitarist fits right into Second Coming's style. I hope for nothing but the best for this incredibly talented band.
5,The Best CD I've heard in years...,"I bought this CD on the spot after hearing ""Vintage Eyes,"" and only smiled wider when I heard each new song. Ballads like ""The Song"" and ""Travisty"" demonstrate superb songwriting skill, along with the fact that Travis Brach has an amazing voice, and ""Confessional"" and ""Soft"" prove that Second Coming can pull off hard edge rock with style. This record Shows the band's amazing diversity as it shows off their skill, and every song is a winner. I'm looking forward to watching them live, but if you can't get out to see them, buy this CD now."
3,1998 remembers this,"Remember this group kiddies? There two popular songs( ""Soft"" and ""Vintage eyes"" make this worth buying used and only used. The rest of the cd kind fades so dont waist a lot of time on it listen to it once and add it to the collection."
2,The Original Line Up!,"The original line up was so much better. The sound with this line up is a typical ""Seattle sound"" rip off that's over and done with. Leave that sound to the originators.While the album is okay I liked where they were headed when Maxi fronted the band. Perhaps they'll get back to there roots next time around."
4,It gets better every time I play it,"Had I written this after first listening to the album, it would've started at three stars, for a good first effort. But this album just grows on me. Having read some, but not all, of the reviews, I am surprised that one band name was not mentioned. Aside from AIC and Soundgarden influences, I listen to this album and I feel Queensryche, particularly in the array of sound and tone. As much as I enjoy this album (and I highly recommend it), I am excited about Kelly Gray's influence as Chris DeGarmo's replacement in Queensryche.But back on point, Second Coming gives us all hope that rock remains strong. I look forward to digging into the past work of Travis Bracht and Dudley Taft. This is strong music."
5,Goosebumps!!!,"What more can I say about this incredibly talented band that hasn't already been expressed previously. 700 words is not enough.. (don't get me started..!!)Travis Bracht remains the only ""rock singer"" to ever give me goose bumps!GO BUY THIS CD!! It will NOT leave your CD player, and the grin will NOT leave your face.If you miss their live show, should they pass thru your city/town....TRAVISTY!!!They quite simply, rule."
5,AN ALBUM THAT TRULEY KICKS.....,"I've grew up listing to travis since the BRIGADE days, and the boy's got some lungs!!and I just got dudley's first album, and he truely rock with the best. As for Jonny and James, their first effort was good. But for the new line up of this Quartet, Is so incredablly awesome. So any music fan looking for a new sound, this would be the CD to get. This is this best band to come out since the original line up of KISS.. You guy's truly kick!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A Second Try,"I wrote and submitted a customer review of this book a few days ago. Although it was posted, it has mysteriously disappeared, along with a number of other negative reviews. In the interests of having sincere reviews posted without censor, I should like to try again. In my review I indicated that I had enjoyed Bobrick's book, ""The Fated Sky."" I also said quite honestly that I had enjoyed even more an earlier book on the history of astrology published in 2003 by David Berlinski entitled ""The Secrets of the Vaulted Sky."" It was my view that readers interested in the history of astrology might also be interested in Berlinski's book, especially since Bobrick's book is amazingly similar to Berlinski's earlier one. I recommend to readers interested in these topics the earlier published and well written text by Berlinski, a well known scientific writer."
4,Cesta All stars and Eddie Palmieri re-visited.,"There's a reason both these singers were part of Eddie Palmieri's group. Both have an incredible ability to adapt to the many variants of salsa, as well as baladas. Hey have many similarities from their home town, to having the honor of singer with Eddie Palmieri's group. This album highlights not only this but, their ""soneo"" talent, especially ""No Hace Falta Papel"" which literally means No paper needed. ""El Quinto de Beethoven"" is probably the reason Popssical ever existed, with a nice modern latin twist to Beethoven but with hot, hard-hitting salsa. The saxophone and piano playing are amazing on this one. Note that all of the tracks are available on Palmieri or Cesta All Stars Salsa Festival Vols 1,2 albums. Even though it's a good album, I recommend getting the original albums which are excellent by themselves."
3,Want the old product back,"It seems Nivea has chosen to cut corners with this new formulation. Provitamin B5 is absent and I also noticed a glaring lack of exfoliating beads. Please, please bring back the old ""Engergizing"" formulation! If you are looking for a reasonably priced cleanser this is for you because it's certainly not a scrub anymore."
1,"Product is Awesome, Seller is AWFUL","sent me the wrong item, TWICE, even after returning the item once at my cost, WITH A PICTURE OF THE RIGHT ITEM. Won't use them again, and don't recommend for this reason."
4,Not Bad,"This is a very good face scrub. I really like the energizing feeling and the scrub bubbles. I use it day and night and it's not a problem and isn't too abrasive for my skin. I think it definitely clears any acne up, too, by the micro-dermabrasion function that it performs.My only gripe is that at 4.4 oz, it is a very small amount of scrub. So far it has lasted me a good amount of time, however, and for the price it's still pretty good.Recommend for sure."
1,Avoid this product,"I would not recommend this product to anybody. I used it once and my face got completely dry, red, and started peeling. This lasted for about 3 days, and that was after using it the first (and last) time."
5,Best CD Ever!,"If you like acoustic music than this cd is one for your collections. It swings with touches of gypsy jazz, ""travis style"" finger picking, ""Dawg"" music, rock and blues.If you are a Tommy Emmanuel fan than purchase this cd. If you are not a Tommy Emmanuel fan purchase this cd. Most importantly if you have now idea who he is definitely purchase this album.Jim Nichols and Tommy Emmanuel play off each other like only the best musicians can. Totally in sync, they play with the force and sound of a full band. Yet the style of music and the playful way they interact with each other, the album is as intimate as if they where close friends playing to you in your own home.This CD makes me smile every time I listen to it. That is the best way I can describe it."
5,happy hour,the cd Happy Hour offers many many happy hours of listening pleasure. A great selection of songs. Tommy Emmanuel's performance as always is phenominal. Jim Nichols can be heard in the background and they both seem to enjoy interacting with one another . When I listen to this cd I become so aborbed in the music that it just makes me get up and dance along with the rhythm of the music. It's a combination of ragtime and blues and all that jazz. If you have Tommy's other cds you will certainly want to add this one to your collection. Victoria
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,THIS IS A COMEDIAN THAT I HAD NEVER HEARD OF. I READ A REVIEW AND WAS PULLED IN BY THAT. THIS DVD IS NOT FUNNY AT ALL. THE COVER DETAILS THIS ONE COMEDIAN BUT THEIR SEVERELY DIFFERENT COMEDIANS DOING STAND-UP. THE VIDEO LOOKS OLD AND THE JOKES WERE JOKES I'VE HEARD FROM OTHER COMEDIANS. I HATE I WASTED MY MONEY & PAID FOR EXPRESS SHIPPING FOR THIS DVD. I HAD COMPANY OVER FOR XMAS TO WATCH THIS DVD AND SOMEONE TOOK IT OUT THE PLAYER & PUT IT BACK IN THE CASE BEFORE IT ENDED. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DVD. GEORGE A HOST NOT THE HEADLINER. ALL GEORGE DOES IS INTRODUCE THE COMEDIAN. . BY FAR THIS WAS ONE OF THE WORSE COMEDY DVD'S I'VE COME ACROSS. THE FACT THAT I PAID FOR IT IS REALLY WHAT I DON'T LIKE!! HE TOLD NOT 1 JOKE THAT WAS FUNNY. HE JUST STOOD ON STAGE WITH A DRINK IN HIS HAND TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE. I SEE NOW WHY I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS COMEDIAN. DON'T WASTE UR MONEY!!
4,Turn Around,The dvd is good! I watched it serveral times. It's a good ice breaker for when you have company over.
3,I've seen George better than this performance!,"I thought it would be more of his turn around act. He could have had a few more ""better"" starring comedians."
4,Another Great Romance!,I loved this story for the action alone. The writer took me back to this time and place. I fell in love with the characters and the story line. This story was different than the first book more factual but I loved this one as much as the first. I can't wait to see what comes next from this new and talented writer. I'm proud to see new talent coming out of the south.
4,Another Great Romance!,I loved this one as much as the first. More action in this story. This story was different than I expected after reading the first book but enjoyed it enormously.I loved the way it was based on a real person and could transport myself to the time and place of the story.Can't wait to see what comes out next from this new and exciting writer.
3,"Get the revised, expanded edition, not this one.","I had a copy of the second edition first, then lost it, then grabbed this one used without thinking and upon receiving the book realized this is not the version I had. Whoops, that was dumb. I'll have to buy the other edition still.This is still a good book (I wouldn't kick it out of bed) but it's almost entirely weaving with fewer illustrations and photos and about half an inch of the text block is filled with (now) way out of date resources. The second edition has far, far more information on dyeing, fiber prep and spinning. So go get that version, because it's a great book!"
1,Save your money!,"If you are looking for information on spinning with a wheel - don't buy this book! It sets you up to fail. If you are a beginner, please keep looking for other resources."
5,Utterly useful!,"This book includes wonderful information on primitive looms, reducing the expense of getting equipped to weave and making it more accessible to all income levels. The drawings are clear and informative and provide a real understanding of weaving and weaving equipment. Highly recommended!"
5,a very different baby book,"this is an amazing approach to young children's literature. emphasis is placed on the text, and sentences and pictures alternate every other page. the drawings are kind of strange, but certainly artistic. the story is charming and inigo is not a typical narrating toddler, he is aware of himself and his world. his is also interesting and confident. this book is a lot of fun and a very appropriate text for an early reader, or even an emerging reader of preschool age."
3,Nice Overview of the most sucessfull Battleship ever built,"The Queen Elizabeth class battleships are without doubt the most sucessful Battleship design eve in terms of cost length of service and accomplishment, and Warspite was the most sucessfull of the class (with most battle honours of any RN Ship). This book gives a nice overview of the ship; plenty of pictures etc, but the service history is somewhat superficial which really doesn't do service to the class or the ship."
3,A modeler's dream,"A book for someone wishing to make a super- detailed model of HMS Warspite, but of little interest for the average military history buff. Drawings of the wooden buffer over the armor belt take details to the ultimate overkill."
1,Surprisingly depressing for a children's book,"Although this book is, on the surface, a pleasant glimpse into the life of a third grade boy, Chris, and his recently acquired kitten Tiger, it is filled with shockingly dark undertones. Gripping poverty is the subject of most of the book's chapters. For instance, in the first chapter, Chris's mother tells him that they do not have enough money to buy a new pencil for the start of school. Chris is initially not allowed to get Tiger because the family cannot afford their rent or grocery bills. In the latter chapters, the family's financial prospects brighten in anticipation of an upcoming photo shoot that is to take place in their house. For one brief moment, it appears as though everything will work out for the better, until SURPRISE, the cat ruins the photo shoot by eating the negatives and the family is poor again. That is how the book ends. Sorry for ruining it."
5,The world will little note...,"what I say here about Mickey Newbury and this album - ""'FriscoMabel Joy."" But, if you listen to the songs on this CD, you will surely be as taken as I was with his haunting lyrics and voice. I saw Mickey on TV many years ago and hadn't thought any more of him 'til I heard Waylon Jennings sing ""San Francisco Mabel Joy"" and happened to notice who wrote it. I'm glad I did because it has opened up a new and wonderful world of the kind of music I enjoy-country ballads. I was surprised to find it on CD and with the addition of ""San Francisco MabelJoy."" It wasn't on the original album. I have since found that most of his albums have been re-issued on CD. I've also pur-chased the ""Harlequin Melodies"" CD. It's also a great album, but 'Frisco is my personal favorite."
4,Gives you what you need.,"Remember this is an atlas not a typical textbook with thorough defenitions. Instead you get a comprehensive look at slides of most of the cells, structures and tissues you need to know for most graduate level histology courses.The only minus I give this atlas is it is misssing a few structures in our lecture for which I just resorted to google instead."
3,Gift for a friend but I didn't like the music,"The product was fine, shipping was fine content of product is to manic for me..it was a gift."
5,"Simple, Friendly, Beautiful Book","We have not personally adopted from Haiti, but know some Haitians who have been adopted into our community. This book is a positive, beautiful book that shows a bit of what Haiti is like without dwelling on or highlighting any negatives. My 3 1/2 year old daughter already enjoys it, and it is one we will be able to come back to through the years and get more and more out of it. Beautifully made, cute and simple story of a market day and tap-tap ride. Tasteful window into a different culture."
3,"It's Fun, But...","""Torch Song"" is fun to watch, but not as much so as I'd expected. Parts of it are downright dull, and one really has to pay attention to have any clue what's going on.I still don't know why everyone seems to practically worship Jenny Stewart( Joan Crawford), especially when she's such a pill. The only reason that Jenny falls for Tye( Michael Wilding) is that he WON""T take her abuse. She respects him, I guess. But she seems very confident that he'll melt like everybody else when she decides to beckon. Yeah, sure.My favorite part is when, in a typical hissy after the ""Two-Faced Woman"" number( calls to mind Meredith Brooks' ""I'm a B****"")Jenny rips off her black wig, revealing orange hair that is rather jarring combined with her fake-mulatto makeup. Yuck.And she's even grouchy with Michael Wilding's guide dog.Carol Burnett's parody, ""Torchy Song"", is lots better than the original.Devout Joan Crawford fans( and there are bound to be some) should opt for ""Mildred Pierce"" instead."
5,Joan is the star!!!,"Unintentionally hilarious film with Crawford as the great Jenny who finds truth in a blind man's love for her.The real fun strats at the strat when Joan tells her parftner in a really clop clop dance routine that she will NOT move her leg and ""spoil that line??""Ther is the famous Two- Faced Woman number with Joan in black face that stuns even after many viewings. How did Joan get the nerve to do it? It was done by Cyd Charissse and cut from a film she made of it and as great as Cyd is, Joan's is more arresting, and of course crazy. What can equal this in musical film history? Maybe Lost Horizon (1973)??Many great lines and lots of Joan being mean to everyone in her path.Michael Wilding is way off the beam but who cares. Joan is all in all. Buy it wherever you can."
3,Doesn't really match description...,I purchased this book because the description said it had templates and would be useful. There were really no examples and not much info at all on retention. Might be useful just for research.
3,methuen's monographs,"This book is based on a course of lectures given at a Military College of Science, Shrivenham, to Army students taking Engineering Physics. It is intended for the physicist, physiologist engineer. Answers what is servomechanism. Contents: Closed Sequence Control Systems, Basic Equations of Linear Servo Systems, Transient and Steady State Behaviour, Harmonic Response Diagrams, lag Correction and Stabilization, Notes on Non-Linear Problems. Contains index, references, and bibliography."
5,GreekPhilosophy vs God,I was pleased to find this book offered on Amazon. It is the best resource I have ever encountered which provides an overview of the influences during the 1st through 4th centuries A.D which changed the principles of theology from those understood by the apostles of Christ to those incorporated into the various creeds adopted after 325 AD.
1,Don't waste your time,Refuting this book is not worth my time; however I would like to warn others - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY: This book is Mormon Propaganda.
5,In our own Image,This book is a must have for every African American Family. It recalls the very positive experiences and rituals that shape the landscape of our history. There is something in this book for everyone. The pictures and the stories will warm you heart and make you proud to be African American! It is a artistic and literary masterpiece. The photos are from the early 1800's to present day. The artist Karen Pugh has done paintings for this book that are the likes of nothing that I have every seen! Keep your eye out for this very talented women. You must have this book! Buy and few copies and share this very rich history with someone you love!
3,Mensa Mensa,"Future Sounds of Jazz No. 3 is okay. It's not too hot and not too cold. The saving grace of this album is that it is a 2 CD set. You get nearly two hours of music. There are 20 tracks in the album. Half of those are previously unreleased songs and half of them shouldn't have been released. The first five songs of the first CD are garbage. From track 6-11, it's all the way live. On the second CD, the same holds. Half the songs suck and the other half are live. All in all. If you take the good tracks off this set, you would really have one CD. I am rating this album 3 stars because of the inclusion of so many mediocre tracks. All the good tracks on this album would garner this set a 5 star rating."
4,Everyday Book of Wisdom,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! The title is very fitting for this little book of wisdom. These ladies are living a full life and have alot of experiences to share that are common to all peoples of all walks of life. I continually found myself reading this book out loud to whoever was around. It is funny, contemplative, and inspiring. It's one you'll want to share with friends and family."
3,sweet,"If you have been following the story of these sisters (both over 100 years old) you will enjoy this book. Soap recipes, yoga tips, money management and quite a few anecdotes of living in Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance. A very quick read."
4,Sisterly advice,Good companion book to other 2 books by the Delany Sisters. Amazing. They both lived to be over 100. Not just lived but thrived. These are powerful role models for us all. I would have liked to know them.
5,Excellent CD-great for new babies and parents!,This CD contains a variety of artists singing songs to help your little one fall asleep. The songs are all wonderful and will definitely pull at your heart strings-especially if you are a new parent.
3,"Maybe Two Nice Selections, The Rest Lean Towards C&W.","Actually, there are some charming selections in this collection, but they seem to be a bit on the side of Country and Western music. So, if you really enjoy Country Music, this is a nice choice."
5,Soothing and pleasant,I love this CD! This is also another CD I play on a daily basis in my daycare during naptime! 11years and still not tired of hearing it!!!
5,Robust. Slightly heavy - good protection. Kid proof.,"Robust construction. This is being used by a middleschooler whose earlier case did not survive the wear and tear after two years. He is very happy with it. The instrument is well protected by the rigidity of construction. Overall, this is a good looking case."
4,pro pac case,like the case a lot of space to put thing if it come with a lock will be nice will another if needed
3,I'm surprised it didn't work for me,"I must say I really liked this product. The first part isjust like a therapy session.I felt much better. Although I have only listened to it every day for 6 days, it has not worked for me, but I have slept much better.I think that I must continue to listen for 6 weeks in order to give my final review.I lost 65 lbs with a hypnosis tape in the 90's and kept it off for 5 yrs. I have tried it again and nothing works,even different hypnosists.I think it might work for others.Me, I have no idea whyits not working."
3,Boring music,"I didn't care for the type of music presented on this particular CD, but others might find it very relaxing and soothing. It's a new age style of music, which is what's generally used on these types of CDs. If I still had the CD, I'd probably try it again, but I don't have it anymore."
2,bulky,"My mistake, I did not look on dimensions of this clock before I bought it. It is bulky, would be very nice piece of equipment if would be much smaller. Besides, uses two batteries aa, first set was gone completely after one month, I was late to work because of that. Second set I have already two months looking forward to have another unexpected oversleeping(my last alarm clock was going on one battery 1 year)"
4,What's not to like?,"Smooth to skin, but has static in the dry weather. Overall, good product, and great price; what's not to like?"
2,meh,"The first movie was funny, maybe a little corny... but good. This one is a pathetic, extremely corny sequel... but the filming of this one is totally different than the first so not even sure it's a real sequel. The camera angles & such were different - like it was a reality show as opposed to a 'horror movie.' Really didn't like it. (Luckily, I had no problems with the seller I bought from)"
3,St. Ivers Lotion,"I was a little disappointed, I thought I was ordering just Aloe lotion. The product I received was the same product I could have gotten in the store for half the price."
5,Don't wait.... Buy now!,"This is my favorite release of 1998.If you're an old power pop fan like me, this is the disc you need to keep the faith. It sounds great out of the box, but really grows on you.If you like The Replacements, OLD Goo Goo Dolls, Jellyfish, Big Star, 70's pop or Todd Rundgren's poppier-fare, don't wait...buy now!This CD is packed with catchy hooks, great songwriting and production... You've really got to hear it."
3,action adventure,"this movie is very good as story goes , color not to bad but the voice does not fit in to well with the speach. but they are both good for the price and well worth watching if you like this kind of movies print is a lttle bad in parts and the clarity is poor at the start and again close to the ending."
3,Save your money,"I enjoy old movies ALOT. This movie disappointed mebecause of the grainy picture and dull acting.Two good biblical movies. ""Soloman and Bathesheba""has a young and very sexy Yul Brenner (sp). ""TheStory of Ruth"" very good."
3,"Good, but outdated information","I got this book as a primer on traveling with a disability. I have Multiple Sclerosis and am both a ""Wheeler"" and a ""Slow Walker"" depending on the day. I found the information in Candy Harrington's book quite helpful as a place to start learning about accessible travel, but was sad to learn that many of her references are now outdated.Fortunately, there is a new edition of this book, published earlier in the year. I haven't purchased it yet, but intend to. With current information, if the new edition is as comprehensive as this one, it would warrant 5 stars. This is a book for anyone, young or old, who happens to live with a disability -- even a temporary one -- but doesn't intend to be defined by it. Get out and travel!"
3,Good for wheelers but flimsy for the slow walkers,"I think it's a fairly good book, but has more focus to those limited to those in wheelchair and less for slow walkers. A couple of tips for slow walkers the author didn't mention was that several hot destination areas rent or loan for free wheelchairs or scooters. Such as all DC museums which loans out wheelchairs free of charge. (A piece of information I learned by chance.) Any travel desinations or activities for slow walkers? I'm still trying to figure that out as I try to plan vacations for my father who's a slow walker and rather a large person, too. Did you know that most Las Vegas hotels rent scooters to those slow walkers - and they let you store them in your room and take them out in the town. Though, the title does suggest that it's a guide for wheelers and slow walkers, it's probably more suited for ""...A Nuts and Bolt Guide for Wheelers"" and leave out the slow walkers as it doesn't offer too much on this subject."
2,No Big Whoop,"I could, have, and you can get the same information from chat rooms or message boards. Don't waste your money."
4,very useful book for travelers with disabilities,this book delivers what its title advertises. don't leave home without using this book to plan any of your trips.
2,Nifty idea but flimsy,"Nifty idea, but breaks too easily. I purchased this item due to my back problem and it worked great for a while until the grip fell off. I thought it was just a manufacturing defect and therefore purchased another one. Same problem again. Will not buy again. A typical As Seen on TV item, poorly constructed."
5,Handy gadget,Very useful tool for me. The top shelf is useful now and was trying it out in the yard picking up things. I like it.
3,Good but are designed to break so you'll buy another,"These are good and handy pick up tools but they are deliberately designed so the plastic that holds the screw that holds the rubber cup will crack, and the cup will come off and you'll go out and buy another pickup tool. Be prepared to drill through the little cup and use your own little screw and nut to hold the cup in place, or just don't buy it."
4,Nice Product,"My elderly aunt,who is in a nursing home,wanted a grabber that folded so she could put it in her satchel on her wheelchair.I liked this one because it seemed easy to use. It is easy to use.I also tried it around my house before I gave it to her.I picked up a jar of pickles,so it had good weight usage.I also picked up a pen,so it picks up small things too.The handle was also sturdy but not hard to squeeze.It folded easily.I purchased this last year and she still is using."
1,no more gophers,"When I first started buying gophers 10 years ago they were a precision instrument. I could pick up toothpicks, grains of rice and even needles from a carpet or any other surface. The last few I bought had the cups misaligned. The current and last one I will ever buy is assembled with the jaws at a 90 degree angle. From now on I will pay a little more and get something of better quality.As the song goes : ""since there ain't no zeroes I'll give it a one."""
2,Breaks...,"I recieved aOntel Products GOPMO2 Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tool Setfor Christmas of 2009 and it broke in July of 2010. My Mom has owned 3 Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tools in a 2 year period. I even tried to fix one of her Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tools that had a suction cup on the end that kept falling off, that the 30 day warranty was up on. I used a bit longer screw since the other one flew into the unknown when it broke and to try to get a better connection. I also used super glue with the longer screw and it broke again 3 days later. I would NOT reccomend this Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tool . There are better Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tools out there to purchase. The Deluxe Gopher Pick Up and Reaching Tool seems to always break after the 30 day warranty has expired. Amazon.com has much better grabbers for sale."
1,needs parts,My first gopher lost a suction cup while getting a sack of sugar of a grocery store shelf. I have not been able to find replacement suction cups anywhere. Apparently it will not handle five pound loads as advertised.My second gopher (needed after the first lost an irreplacable suction cup) lost both suction cups while trying to pick up a wrench from a rough concrete floor.I will not buy another gopher until Ontel provides replacement suction cups (preferably free since I've bought two of them and they both failed in the same manner).It seems Ontel's opinion is what do you expect for ten bucks. I expect it to work as advertised and last more than six months. I cannot afford a new one every six months so will try to find a competitor who will stand behind his product.
1,Poor product quality,"I have bought 2 ""Gophers"". Both broke down after 3-4 uses. The two ""sucker caps"" at the ends of the grip come off making the tool useless. It is non-repairable. Don't waste your money."
2,DISAPPOINTMENT,"I ACTUALLY LOVED THIS WHEN I FIRST GOT IT. THE LOCKING FEATURE WAS THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE.I GOT ONE FOR CHRISTMAS, AT THE END OF FEB. IT FELL APART. THE SUCTION CUPS FELL OF AND THE SCREWS WENT FLYING - COULDN'T FIND THEM. I TRIED SUPER GLUING THE PCS BACK TOGETHER - NO HELP. I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE IN MAY OF THIS YEAR AT WALGREENS AND A MONTH LATER THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO THAT ONE. THEY NEED TO BE MADE STRONGER!!!!!!! PLEASE REDESIGN AND TRY AGAIN.THANKS,VIRGINIA SALTER"
1,NOT impressed - poorly designed and flimsy,"Got this for my parents. Plan to return it. It looks flimsy. Could not fold w/out probably breaking it. Had to use two hands to old tight enough to get small box from the upper shelf of pantry. A neighbor of my parents had similar tool they were raving about, but it obviously was NOT this one! Not impressed."
4,A handy tool to have around...,"I have had one of these for a few years and used it occassionally to reach things up high. Recently, I broke my ankle and have been confined to my recliner for the most part. This tool has become very important to me to be able to get things I need without calling someone to help me. I am ordering an extra pair to keep around the house.For those of you who haven't been able to find replacement suction cups, they are available online from Ontel products at [...]"
3,pick up tool,The tool was fairly sturdy but I found the same product a week later for half the price!
4,Everyone needs one !!,Surgery prevented me from bending-- so picking up items off the floor-this is something everyone should have. While it is only for light weight items it's still saving stitches from breaking apart!!
1,No replacement parts!,"Great idea, poorly executed. Works just for a bit and I do mean just a bit. Suction cups loosen, break off and THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENT PARTS TO BE HAD!!! REPEAT THERE ARE NO REPLACEMENT PARTS TO BE HAD! CAVEAT EMPTOR! My one star rating was a gift. If zero stars were available I would have rate it that."
2,"No, Don't Buy!",I've had two of these and will not buy another. I bought them at a store near me.The first one lasted a couple of years so I bought another.The suction cups did't stay on either one and I had to constantly screw or glue them back on.Then one day while decorating for Xmas one cup came off of the last one and I still can't find it to this day which renders the tool unusable.I only had the last one two or three months.A cheap price for cheap tool. In this instance I did get what I paid for.Won't buy this again.
2,Gopher - poor quality!,"Since I have to be careful bending and stooping I was happy to purchase the Gopher to help me. However, after back surgery I was using this tool often and the rubber tips came off. I tried using a bigger screw but it didn't work and then I glued it but that only helped a few days. I am very disappointed and won't waste my money on this company's products anymore!"
1,JUNK!,"I had back surgery recently and I felt this was a must. For the next 6 months I can not bend or twist so the JUNKPHER was going to be my helper. In 8 weeks I have gone through 3 of them for $20 a pop. The plastic is cheap and breaks easily! The screws come out of the suction cup on the ends, have they not heard of lock tight. Either way if you have a choice DO NOT BUY THIS YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!!"
1,The cups will fall off,"After a few days of heavy use one of the suction cups on the end fell off. I screwed it back on but it fell off again a few hours later. The plastic hole that the screw fit into was cracked (it is not a metal nut and bolt, it is just a metal screw into plastic) and not usable anymore.These things are very cheaply made. I was talking to my mother and she said exactly the same thing happened to her.You will be tempted to buy these things because they are really cheap. But if you are stuck at home, unable to bend over or reach for things, and if this is your only reacher -- and it suddenly stops working -- then you are really, really stuck. (I am recovering from hip surgery. Fortunately I have some other reachers. (Another one I have is called EZ-Grabber -- it is almost as cheaply made as the Gopher but it uses metal nuts and bolts.)"
2,"Great invention, but not durable","The gopher grabber is extremely useful to my ailing back. My only complaint is that they don't hold up AT ALL. I have been through 4 in the past 9 months and that is under normal household use. It's not like I even used them everyday. The same thing happened with all of them. One of the suction cups came off, the screw went flying, and the inside hole was stripped out, leaving me with a useless piece of junk."
4,Very durable! Very cute! Very annoying!,"I got this for my daughter for her 1st bday. I have to say that whatever batteries come with this last forever! It is almost a year later and the song still plays! At first, it is quite loud and there is no volume control but now it is much softer, but amazingly still works after almost daily play. The song is annoying but that is the only real complaint i have. It has never tipped over, fallen apart or anything like that and my daughter plays pretty rough with it. I would say this is a pretty good toy, not a bad price either."
2,Too strange...,"I love hymns, and I love classical music. But why must one listen to both at the same time? Her arrangements are creative, but it seems as if there is no sense of flow. I like my hymns to be hymns, and my classical music to be classical music, OK?"
5,Works well for over a year,"I purchased this product because of the magnetic cover and business card holder. After a year of use and seeing what other people had and hated, I'm very pleased with the case and charger. The case is used every day and has not shown any wear and tear on it."
2,"They are now sending replacement #7553, which is not what you want!!","Call store beforehand to confirm whether you are receiving 7553 or 9985. Grady's Hardware sent me 7553 instead, which is not what most people are looking for (it has side vents that let water all over your BBQ to sit on the stainless steel side tables for weeks). Weber really messed up the 7553, and I recommend you avoid making the same mistake as myself and call ahead for 9985!"
2,Weber Cover,Good quality other than the vents. Thought I purchased a cover without vents. The vents allows the trash in that I was trying to keep off the grill. Have not figured out as yet why a designer would put vents on a cover right over the trays on each side of the grill. I would not purchase this cover again.
5,Awsome video!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is an awsome video. I've been into bellydance for 2 years and this was the best Tribal video that i've seen yet. Very easy to follow, the girls are beautiful and the dance steps are pretty cool too!!! I would recommend this video to anyone!!"
2,Working Wagon Wheels (Old West Collection),"The author spent a lot of time in designing this wood wagon wheel that almost resembles an old farm wagon wheel. As designed this wheel (1)won't carry a 1/2 ton or more in weight, (2)has no dish for side loading, (3)Hub is banded with two bands instead of four, (4) wood is not treated to prevent wood rot, (5) wheel tyre (outer steel band needs to be a minium of 3/8 thick. It's a shame that such beautiful wood is wasted on something that can't be used on original wagons that are used today on wagon caravans. However, this is a great project for the amature that want's to build wheels and projects for display. For the serious woodworker build it the old way. Your project will then increase in value, not decrease."
2,I found that the gel made my hair ...,"I found that the gel made my hair fairly manageable, but lacked a certain degree of hardness upon drying. In addition, the lack of a good scent turns me away from this product. I would use it if it were free, but would not recommend it highly to anyone."
2,The gel itself is too thick. I applied ...,The gel itself is too thick. I applied an amount the size of my palm to my hair. It still felt loose and I was not able to get the extra hold or control that the gel promised. I have a full head of hair that reaches just below my ears and this product didn't allow me to maintain the control I wanted.
2,This product really isn't what I'm looking for. ...,"This product really isn't what I'm looking for. If you have thin, fine hair, like me, I think a better product is """"Thicker Fuller Hair"""". While the hairdressing Gel from Alberto V05 does provide manageability, I prefer simply using hair spray (although some men probably shy away from that). I used the product after washing my hair and the results were okay, but I think the product would be better suited for someone with a different type of hair. I wouldn't buy this product for myself."
2,Can't play old-school pokemon without it!!!,"Wow, this took me back... Opening up the link cable box, connecting my game boy with my game boy colour and starting my first ever pokemon trade... still can't beat that feeling."
1,Why doesn't it work?,"This cable does not work on my two Game Boy SPs. I'm pretty sure it's not the Game Boys, because my GBA-GBA and GBA-GCN cables work."
4,Not Bad!!!,"In the book, the main character has to switch schools. Of course, she has to decide who's who. The question is- who CAN she trust?This is a good realistic fiction book. It's very realistic. Perfect for ages 8-11.The best parts of the book were the CONFESSION SESSIONs, where you get to see what all the minor characters are thinking.Definitely a good book."
4,If you liked 'Higher Education' you'll want this story,"Shelby J. P. Cheever is the only son to J. P. Cheever. On an Earth populated by a billion poor souls maybe ten thousand are rich. Of those ten thousand maybe one hundred have more wealth than is imaginable. And of those one hundred, maybe ten are in the same level of power and wealth as Shelby's father. Not unimaginably, Shelby is Rich, Fat, Spoiled, and Useless. And now he's adrift in space...Neat. Reminds me of some of the early heinlein stories. Anyone read 'HAVE SPACE SUIT WILL TRAVEL' recently?"
2,Previously published as...?,"There was a note missing from the copyright page: ""This book was previously published in slightly different form under the title _Captins Couragous_ by R Kipling"" This is a retelling of the Kipling book with the most minor of changes to set it in space, even to the point of calling the smaller spaceships 'Dorys' and retaining many other terms and elements which made sense in their original setting and don't here. Changing one character from male to female introduced a mild romantic sub-plot, and moving the festival scene from the end to the middle of the voyage was interesting, as was the added cloak&dagger sub-plot, but the original is still better."
5,THE Best Jarre Concert I'v seen,I watched this concert live on Internet tv TVP PolandThis is a must have item
2,New Geneva and Goldsborogh Pottery,"This book was in poor condition and was not worth the money I paid for it. It obviously wasn't for me but for a pottery collector, this would have been a good source to identifying the different potteries produced in Geneva and Goldsborough."
5,Lars is a favorite,"My grandson, age 2, absolutely loves Lars. This is the second purchase in this video series, and he watches each one when he needs quiet time to relax. This is a gentle story, I like it too."
3,Cute,"I gave it to my 3-1/2 yr. old Grandson.......I think it is a little ""old for him"".....he gets bored 1/2 way through."
5,No Hat,Not able to obtain hat. Apparently not in stock but listed for purchase. Sent email after purchase that the item not available.
4,Quiet and works well,I have a fairly small lawn(about 6000sq ft) of bermuda grass. I used the default factory setting and it wasnt cutting much. I adjusted the height to the lowest possible and my lawn looks a lot better now. Like the previous reviewer said you will need an edger/trimmer.
5,Great low-cut mower!,"I was looking for a cheaper alternative to my DIY backyard putting green that I am growing bentgrass on. This one works well, cuts to low 1/2 inch and I am planning to modifies the wheels (sand it down another 1/4 inch) so I can cut it to 1/4 inch, which would be near perfect for putting greens without me having to buy one of those $1000 putting mowers."
2,Not practical for the average household,"I bought this book based on the great reviews by others. I was disappointed that this book was very technical and some of the suggestions for newborn development were so unrealistic. How many people have a track for their newborn to navigate??? I'm sure the methods work but I felt discouraged, not inspired, after reading this."
2,2 Thumbs Down,"As first time parents, my husband and I were excited to start reading this book, but it turned out to be a complete waste of time and money. The suggestions in it are impractical from time and space standpoints. I would not recommend this book for any parent."
1,TRULY REGRET BUYING THIS BOOK!,This Book is more For a book to be use in Dr Doman's Class! IF you decide to go to their school!If they don't come up with instructional DVD you should forget about buying this book because it is definatelt NOT user friendly!I really want my money back!
3,"Impractical, but Interesting","Few modern, working parents (the author advocates against working mothers, by the way) have the time or resources to build the variety of apparatuses required for this program. Crawling track? Neck brace? Unlikely for most of us. Our parental instinct also (wisely) makes us wary of some of the more dangerous activities promoted by the author.The book does, however, give readers some interesting tools for evaluating their babies' reflexes and developmental responses at a depth well beyond what pediatricians assess in routine visits. And it offers a variety of activities (again, employ your parental discretion) designed to demonstrate and build upon babies' natural abilities, as well as their desire to bond with their parents.If you pick and choose, this book offers some valuable information and interesting activities. But take it all with a grain of salt...."
3,Please Keep Tightened,"For larger people these chairs may just be too fragile. They are 'just okay' when it comes to quality and comfort...and if not tightened on a regular basis, they wiggle and even make a 'creaking' sound...making us a little nervous."
3,Get what you pay for...,"Finally found these chairs that match our original dining room set. Was so excited; however, they are wobbly! You can't tighten them enough and they have a lot of ""play"" in them. They work and are visually nice, but definitely ""bulk"" made. Again, get what you pay for."
4,Scary,"I have always heard of this movie but never saw it until recently. A good, strong story the Exorcist is about a young girl who becomes possessed by a demon (or something!) and her mother seeks out a Catholic priest to perform an exorcism to banish it. The acting in the film is first-rate and makes the characters feel real where many movies like this would have made them 2-dimensional. The videography was also awesome. The only two weaknesses I feel is the pace of the film (which is slow at some parts but it allows for good character development) and some plot points which never seem resolved. They are minor but irritating. For instance, what was the relevency to the opening location? You never really find out but I'm sure the novel probably makes it clear. Well worth watching!"
4,Landmark horror film,"This is a landmark horror film that in 1973 pushed the genre to a new standard by displaying a much greater degree of intensity, explicitness, and vileness than what had previously been attempted in a horror film. Many of the film's shocks still hold up well today, thanks to Linda Blair's unnerving performance of 12-year-old girl who overnight turns into a grotesque, obscene, inhuman monster. A mild complaint: the film makes it clear that she is possessed by the Devil, although the original novel doesn't commit to that theory; keeping it ambiguous would have achieved greater suspense and mystery.DVD buyers beware; the DVD version only has Dolby Digital 5.1 audio on one side of the disc (the pan & scan side), not the other side. I would recommend buying the ""25th Anniversary Edition"" DVD of the film, or the more expensive ""Limited Collector's Edition"" DVD that has supplementary material."
5,A realistic horror epic a hellish masterpeice.,"There's not much reveiwing you can do on this powerful film.If someone were to write a review on the hole movie you could spend a very long time perhaps a lifetime reviwing it.This is a moving film on how people view this movie is what your opinon on good vrs. evil.The movie's outline is more on faith vrs.hopelessness religon vrs. chaos and hell.In the midst of all of this happning a poor 12 year old girl, and unexperienced preist who has lost all but his hope.And a man who belives in faith and the word of god but sacrifices himself to something he cannot defeat or begin to understand.All in all Peter Blattys Exorcist will test your mind to belive in faith and religon.And for your hard earned dollars your going to get a great masterpeice on dvd and a very intelligent and thought prevoking movie.And a wild ride into the closest thing your going to get to hell.A truly epic masterpeice."
5,This movie is horrifying,I can't count how many times I've seen this movie and still go to bed with the light on each time. Amazing performances coupled with sound and special effects (and a good script which is a rare commodity these days) you can't miss this movie-not for the weak at heart!
4,Exorcist versus Omen,"We are talking about a movie which is 26 years old now but I think Omen which is from 1976 contains more serious horrors. First of all we see an evil or maybe the devil himself capture the body of a teenager girl and makes fun of it while he is scaring them and of course us. I think seeing her vomiting a disgusting green crap or turning her head 360 degrees are nothing when they are considered the diaglos of the thing and the priest. Because imagining a talk with a satanistic creature is already a horrible action. Therefore the convarsations between devil and person has been extended in the third part which I enjoyed only those dialogs in the movie. Anyway,The Exorcist has always been the number one favourite of all horror movie addicteds and also the great supporter of nightmares for others. But I still keep my vote for Omen."
3,Somewhat scary,"This movie is kind of boring in some parts (like the parts with the priest and his mother) but grabs your attention in other scenes (i.e. watching Linda Blair's head spin). Read the book, though, its much better."
3,Kinda Freaky,"I just watched this dvd for the first time. In the beginning, it was a little slow paced but then it picked up. Did anyone else think the first ten minutes was pointless? Anywayz, it was a movie that made me jump at times and think at times. Well I would buy it if I were you."
5,One of the greatest horror films ever!,"This Movie RULED!!!!!!! I seen it when I was 4 and watch it all the time! Trust me, this is not for the faint hearted. It's not some much gory as it is scary and realisitc! Must see!"
3,The Scariest Movie EVER?!,"I don't know why people think this is even a horror film. It wasn't even that interesting. Not to say I hated it, I just think it is overrated. The DVD is good, and the picture and sound are both pretty good (for a 1973 film). If you want stuff that will scare you, I reccomend ALIEN (1979) or ALIEN3 (1992). Both gave me nightmares for weeks. Chao!"
5,GREAT WITH FRENCH DIALOG ON,"this is a great movie, but it takes it further when you flip to FRENCH AUDIO.My God, it's hysterical. She cusses like a sailor en francais.You'll scream again and again.Mike"
5,"Be careful, so scary things happen, even a trip to the hospital","If you want to be scared, this movie is it. If you believe in GOD, this movie will absolutely terrify you.Not only is this the scariest movie I've ever seen but strange things tend to happen when I watch it. (No joke) When the movie was re-released in theaters several years ago I witnessed the following within the first hour on a single viewing...1. A couple fights nearly broke out2. Some chick was caught smoking pot3. A few people left early because it was too graphic...and this was at a nice theater at an upscale location!Even during filming the set was plagued with accidents and mishaps. This movie is known to send people to the hospital. Although I enjoy watching scary movies, this is the only movie I won't buy on DVD or keep in my home."
2,Scary......To the Fifth Power,"Why the fifth power you ask? Because that's how many times I threw up after watching it. This is the only movie that's ever made me physically ill, and quite frankly, I didn't mind at all. It's totally awesome."
3,"all hype, no scars, just like blair witch","am i the only person who has seen the exorcist? xactly what part of this movie do you guys think is scary. Actually, i thought it was pretty slow-moving and didnt have any scary scenes to it whatsoever. Hell, i though Scream was scarier than this movie. It did have its moments though, but it surely isnt the best horror movie ever made, and no, it's not scary. I recommend Halloween, Alice, Sweet Alice, or Suspiria instead."
5,very scary,I keep my reviews short and blunt.theres a reason everyone was freaked out by this movie as a kid. Plain fact is it is scary. Very realistic portrayal of a possesion. The whole movie has a very creepy feeling and sense of dread to it. Classic horror which relies more on tension then blood.
5,BRILLIANT FILM!,"THE EXORCIST IS THE BEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN! IT'S A REALLY ENCHANTING, MESMERIZING, COMPELLING, STUNNING, THOUGHT-PROVOKING FILM! IF YOU LIKE MOVIES YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST SEE THIS GLORIOUS MASTERPIECE! YOU REALLY CAN'T SAY YOU'VE LIVED UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THE EXORCIST! BUY IT! IT'S MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE FILM!!!"
5,The Making of The Exorcist,"If you want to find out about the real-life tragedies and horrors behind the making of The Exorcist, check out Curse of the Silver Screen - Tragedy & Disaster Behind the Movies by John W. Law in the book section."
1,"An Original Movie but nothing Great. The Movie ""Carrie"" Is Better.","I saw this movie last night for the very first time and i must say that it is not anything special. It is okay, but it is not the best. The Exorcism of Emily Rose(2005) has much more feel than this Exorcist. Oh, in the end, both Preachers die but the young girl lives, and her demons leave her body due to the exorcism that is performed on her.If you want to see a really scary film; the only one i recommend which i think is very nice and highly worth it is a movie titled, ""Carrie"" with actress Sissy Spacek. That is a Classic! A beautiful story with a Tragic ending. The final parts are sad but what a movie. Even the flute music is beautiful, very touching to the soul. Carrie is a film that i would watch again and again."
1,misrepresentation & lies,"Both the case and the disc, as well as the listing of this DVD on Amazon's description, read that the film is presented in Wide-Screen and Dual-Layer, NEITHER ARE TRUE! The exact same misrepresentation on both the case and the disc also goes for All the other releases on DVD. WARNER BROTHERS ARE DISTRIBUTION FAILURES. There has YET to be a Wide-Screen presentation of ""The Exorcist"", hell even ""Harold and Maude"" (a truly awful film) is presented in Wide-Screen format and better remastering, so why not the classic of classics? because Warner Brothers is GARBAGE"
5,Great Movie!,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE! BUT THE SCARY THING IS ON THE BLOCKBUSTER BOX IT SAID IT WAS A TRUE STORY! UH, OH!"
2,Silly. Silly. Silly.,"A modestly entertaining, well-made thriller that has somehow managed to tap into the collective unconscious in a way that few movies ever have.I found the film to be occasionally disturbing (never once actually frightening) and generally convinced that it had something serious to say about GOOD and EVIL. What exactly it is that the film has to say about GOOD and EVIL is never exactly made clear. The anniversary edition of the DVD features interviews with William Friedkin and William Peter Blatty, who speak in hushed tones about the conception/execution of the film, as if they were discussing the creation of some deep and profound work of art. However, all of their best intentions/pretensions cannot disguise the fact that The Exorcist is, in the final analysis, a deeply silly little horror movie, with nothing really important or especially very interesting to say.Still, there are a couple of good jolts, though..."
2,Way Overrated.....not scary.....and really Boring,"I bought this ""classic"" expecting to be at least mildly frightened.What a let down, it was REALLY boring and the ""scary"" parts were anything but."
3,THE EXORCIST,THIS MOVIE IS PRETTY GOOD. BUT A BIT OVERATED. IT IS NOT THAT GREAT. PRETTY GOOD FOR A 70'S FLICK
4,"Great movie, but not as scary as some say.","Let me just say that i loved this movie. Although made 9 years before i was born, i enjoyed it greatly.However, there is no way that i thought it was the scariest movie of all time. It might have been because of all the ""shock/startle"" horror movie out these days, or possibly because i had read the book before seeing it. I made sure that i watched it after dark alone for maximum effect, but it failed to scare me at all. If any thing, i found some of the scenes rather humerous (such as the ""walking"" down the steps) but that might just be my strange sense of humour.Aside from this though, it is a great movie. My best advice is watch it yourself and make up your own mind on it. After all, its been nearly 30 years since it was first released and for it to survive that long, it surely must be considered a classic."
5,"5 twisted, messed up stars","WOW!! This is one chiller that really lived up to all the hyp., but I don't think the ""Virsion You've Never Sceen"" makes this twisted, unforgetable classic any better or any worse.I still think it was totally right for someone in Hollywood to pick this project back up and repalay it in all the movie theaters across the nation so more of the younger generation are aware of it, and so they can get a tast of some real horror with brains."
4,Don't go up there.,"It's hard to believe that this movie is twenty five years old. It stands up to the test of time very well and sets a standard for a much maligned genre. The story of a possessed child and the exercise to roust the devil from within is actually done with a bit of class. The movie has been so imitated and misappropriated throughout the last quarter century that it's difficult not to know the plot and outcome already, that said, the film still scares the bejesus out of ya'. In the anniversary edition you get a new scene that is quite possibly the scariest part of the movie, I skipped back to check it out again after the flick was done. Highly recommended."
4,"Gave me nightmares for a month, but I loved it!","I rented 'The Version You've Never Seen' a few weeks ago, and watched it during broad daylight! It still scared the hell out of me! Aside from a slow start, this movie is unbelievable; the fact that a film as old as this can still be so terrifying. I enjoyed the 'version never before seen' since it included scenes not found in the original theater version, like the notorious 'spider-walk' down the staircase!While 'The Exorcist' is by no means for everyone(when she's doing *SOMETHING* with a crucifix, it can get a bit rough, to say the least!), it is an incredible film, sure to put the fear of God in you! Enjoy!"
5,The most thought provoking film of all time. flawless.,"It is hard to imagine your favourite film being any better after you've seen it in the cinema six times and read the book even more, but rest assured it does. I believe that your favourite film has to be a very personal choice. It has to force emotions that you havn't felt before to be felt. It has to be filled with a plethora of detail. Finally, above all else, it has to change you. The exorcist does this and more. A film buff's christmas and then some. Nearly every scene has the power to either seriously disturb you or feel spiritually uplifted. Karras's dream, karras's mother on the bed in place of regan, the desecration at the church, merrin watching the dogs fighting are to name but a few scenes that are disturbing, yet compellingly watchable. In all a cinematic tour de force and on DVD you'll think you've died and gone to heaven (or hell)."
5,BUY IT NOW!!!!!,This has got to be the one of the best DVD's out there. #1. It's a classic horror flick. #2. It's got more options then I can even think of. #3. Bottom line.....if u like horror flicks and own a DVD....what are u waiting for???
3,I just don't see the horror,I watched this with my cousin and I thought it was as funny as hell.(No pun intended.) I just couldn't stop cracking up.
2,Don't want to see it again,"Frankly, I think this movie is overrated. I didn't think it was horrible, but I thought it was really slow, and totally based around shock, vulgarity, and disgust, and not around an interesting plot. To each their own I guess, but I don't see what all of the hype is about. I personally think The Omen is a much better movie than this, but hey, just my opinion."
3,"Great movie, but slow.","Ok to start off, this movie was good. It wasn't necessarily scary, just really freaky. Many scenes were horrific and disgusting! The movie was good, especially being made quite a long time ago. It was really slow at some parts, but otherwise it was a freaky, good, interesting movie which is what people will get when they purchase this. It's a classic to see! I don't recommend purchasing it, just renting it would be enough! I've owned it for a long time and only watched it 2-3 times."
3,This is ridiculous!,"I just happened to see this movie on TV for the first time at 69, almost 40 years after it was shot, not being a fan of horror movies (unless by Polanski and the Hammer studios) and trying to postpone the real horror of filling in my IRS declaration.Well, movie nicely shot and acted, though a bit slow, good transfer - but what about the plot! How come catholic priests can exorcise a Sumerian demon out of people who do not believe in either of them? How come obsession must always be obnoxious (spit, vomit and bloody abrasions) and obscene (well, given the catholic view on sex, what else)? Why does the obsessed have to be a girl in puberty?Wrong questions? Look at your reviews slobbering on regaining faith, sorry: Faith! That much for not confusing facts and fiction. I don't, but they might.Fiction or not, I'd like to have its bias declared. For real horror, dig into the history of the Roman church among others."
3,could of done better,This movie isnt scary at all. not even a little . whats the point the devil goes inside a girl so. This move has no jumps not terror. I mean this isnt really a horror movie its more like drama. but i have to say is was a good movie . But not scary at all
1,STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Stupid!Stupid!Stupid! Dumb, pointless hard to watch without falling asleep. Bad acting.This has to be the worst movie ever!!"
1,YAWN,"For years I heard all about this film and how it was so ""scary & disturbing"".Not long ago I actually saw it and was so BORED by it I fell asleep and didn't even bother to finish this garbage.This is perhaps the Most overrated movie of all time, full of cheesy special effects and a typcial hollywood ending. I find NOTHING compelling about the storyline and demonic posession in general. In fact, its one of the most rediculous surviving medieval superstitions that was used to explain mental illness and psychosis.The fact that people were actually scared by it and just go's to show how gullible the masses are."
5,# 1 Film,"William Peter Blatty's novel was the screenplay for this superb film. William Friedkin's direction moves this film beyond any other film since and after. 5 STARS to this exquisite film.DramaSuperb ActingGood v/s EvilThis film is beyond the horror genre, it is it's own genre. The only ONE film."
4,"Classic horror, and more...","I am a die hard horror fan, and therefore had to own this one. I would have to say that I have seen films that were more frightening, but few that strike so dirrectly at such a common social nerve. The film moves slowly at first, but when it takes off, look out! For me, however, the best part was all of the extras on this DVD. The documentary alone was worth the purchase. The sound is finnally worth listening to, and there deleted scenes that are not to be missed! A must-own for horror fans."
4,The original Scary movie,I watch this at least once a momnth. I can't get enough of it. when my kids are old enough I will share the hauntings with them.
5,One of best horror movies ever out of the horror section,The Exorcist extended Director's cut is by far one of the best horror movies ever to come out of the horor movie section. I wasn't even born yet for the orginal movie but when I heard they were coming out with the director's cut I told myself I must have this movie for my horror collection. It lives up to the hype of the scariest film of all time and the bonus scenes really added to the movie pace and endurence. So if your like me and love classic movies of all types of collections then pick this movie up and keep it in your horror collection as a collector's item because the Director's cut of the Exorcist is defently worth the price of having this copy in your movie collection. I never get tired of watching this version time and time again. So don't listen to other reviews just make up your own mind and come buy a classic horror movie that you wont be sorry watching again with the added scenes and material left out of the orginal movie.
2,"Amazon: ""One of the most frightening films ever made""???","This movie is extremely overrated. It moves tooslowly. Regan(who's scared of a 12 year old?) is more funny than scarywith her outbursts. For those of you who find it so scary, you obviously haven't seen many horror movies. Amityville 2: The Possession is a MUCH, MUCH better version of possession. Case closed."
2,The ending is NOT better,"I love this movie and was very disappointed at the way they had to mettle with the movie. When will Hollywood not fix something that was great? Thank God they could not colorize ""Casablanca"""
4,"Great transfer, but the ""extras"" are nothing great..","This version's crystal clear soundtrack adds a lot to the creep factor, crank it up and turn down the lights. Picture quality is great, as well.I didn't know what to expect from the new take, but I like the subliminal images. The best (and hardest to notice) being the faint image of the demon Pezuzuu (sp?) near Regan's bedroom door (Look on the left side of the door as Mother exits the room, in the scene where she comes home to find Regan alone in the house). Creepy...The radio/tv clips are silly. They are just trailers that we've seen last month on, yeah, the tv and radio. The director's commentary is extremely boring. The guy doesn't tell us anything other than what we already know by watching. Seems like he is reading from the actor's scripts. I was hoping for something like the 25th aniversary's documentary, only in a commentary form, but no such luck.That said, rent/buy it anyway. This just gives us an excuse to watch it again."
2,The Original Is The Best,"Undoubtedly one of the most horrifying films ever made, but one of the most terrifying? Nah!!! Almost everything that could be said about this cinematic milestone has long come to pass. I've just dropped by to impress upon all the prospective buyers of this masterpiece to stick with the original. For the lucky ones out there who have yet to experience this film, STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL. The New Director's Cut, while having a superior sound mix, falters in comparison. With the exception of the now famous SPIDER WALK, the re-edit takes away the mystique. For the uninitiated, Mr. Friedkin doesn't let the experience creep up on you, instead(& I would guess it's aimed at the ever-shortening attention span of the younger film-going public)he bashes you over the head with it. Dommage......"
4,"A kid's review, SCARIST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN","This is more scary than A Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday the Thirteenth combine! It is a very scary movie, but is very good. This movie has previews that also might scare you. It has a sad ending that might suprise you. Over 25 years and still scary. That must be a record!"
3,Nothing beats the original!,"Well if you are wandering which version to buy,the ""25th Anniversary Edition"" is the better one. The only thing that I like about the ""version you have never seen"" is the ""spider walk"" and the evil face enhancements during Regan's psychitric appointment.Other than that I feel that the additional scenes only slows down the pace of the original film which was already a cinematic masterpiece."
5,The scariest movie ever made!,"Wow, I've seen this movie 5 times, and let me tell you this is the scariest. The only bad thing is that the beginning is a little slow, but pay attention, it's even scarier when you listen to every word they say. They need to release a directors cut and add more seens of Regan possesed doing more digusting and dispicable things, and more of this demon face. That demon is the baddest film villian ever! ...This is better than the original version, so buy this one. The don't get scarier than this..."
5,Still scary,The Exorcist (the original) is one of the scariest movies ever produced. It's as scary today as when I watched it all those years ago.
4,You will never eat pea soup the same way again.,"This movie wasn't quite so chilling as people gave it credit to be. But rumors say the original version (several omissions were made, from what I hear.), people died from watching this movie. Yes, its true, they had heart attacks.This movie will be remembered as one of the scariest of all time. Though its not that scary (at least in my opinion), it _will_ be remembered as a classic and is definetly worth your time and money."
5,one of the 5 scariest films ever made,"intense.terrifying.realistic.superbly crafted.a landmark. these words describe the exorcist,a must see motion picture that demands mutiple viewings (no,i didn't copy those words off leonard maltin's review of vertigo).one of the best films i've ever seen."
5,The Exorcist was the scariest movie I have seen!,"When I first saw the Exorcist it was late at night and I was watching the last forty-five minutes, and I was convinced to buyit the next day. As I watched it from the beginning, I got bored,but not for long. The flashes with that demon face was enough to give me nightmarish thoughts during daylight. Linda Blair did superb job as Regan, the girl posessed by the devil(or something close to it). The crawl down the stairs had me freaked. And I had seen the other two Exorcist movies before the original. I recommend this movie to anyone with a strong stomach, and doesn't scare easy."
5,Freaky,This is a great movie it kinda reminds me of The Shining which whenI searched this title out it said to me that this movie was suggested for me since I like The Shining. Overall I think thismovie is great.
4,EXORCIST A HEAD TURNING DVD,"I've waited 25 years to see all the behind the scenes stuff...presented excellently on this edition, however, Warners left out ""Regan's first medical exam"" and didnt show the complete ""Regan's birthday trip thru Georgetown"" both cut from the film-SHAME ON YOU BILLY FRIEDKIN...Other than that, this is the buy of the year for DVDs. PS why didnt you include all the radio spots too??????????"
3,"Religion, sex, guilt, violence and silliness","A lot of talent went into this trashy film. Long flights of stairs, darkness, dogs, and psychiatrists are scary but there is also much unintended comedy - a priest who boxes and jogs and lights a cigarette just after his morning run deserves what he gets in this film; Mr Von Sydow's exorcism ritual must have had the cast rolling around clutching themselves in painful laughter; and Ms Blair wetting herself in company goes down a treat. Entertaining, but........"
2,The Not So Scariest Movie of All Time,"I've heard it thousands of times, The Exorcist is the scariest movie of all time. I can tell you right now that I watched it until 2 o' clock in the morning last night and I could sleep as soon as it was over, even during it at some parts. I saw the new version of it, which I believe had some deleted parts even though it has a few new parts. The spider walk down the stairs followed by blood coming out of her mouth was ok, but not that great. The scariest part was the devil face flashing on the screen when she was becoming possessed, but other than that, I did not think this flick was scary. You guys need to rent a real horror flick, such as the original Evil Dead, now there is a sweet movie."
2,Not scary at all,I heard this movie was the ultimate of scary but I beg to differ. My mother and my friend told me that it was really scary and I was like ok lets see how it goes. It was completely pathetic. I didn't find one shred of scary in that movie at all. There were some cool parts like the spider thing down the stairs but not scary. It was probably one of the most disappointing scary movies. It may have been scary back then but frankly its as childish as a Disney film now.
2,Not scary at all but it has a good plot,"i rented this movie because I heard its scary. At the end of the movie i started laughing because it was not scary at all. it has a good plot, but it has corny graphics and no scary aspects. Bambi made me more scared."
1,not scary[to me],"i previously reviewed this movie, but many fans of the film complained about it. just so you know, i'm not changing my point of veiw. i'm just going to write it with more intellegence, or whatever. so this is what i think: it didn't scare me. that's it. i just didn't find it scary, and trust me, cats sometimes scare me. i didn't like certian aspects of it, being a christian. mabey it is because i had 102.2 fever while watching it for the first time. it just didn't scare me. myself. not directed at any of you."
2,Overrated,"Let's not get carried away with the 5 star ratings here. I saw this movie when I was about 12 and it didn't scare me then. The re-release bored me to tears. The movie was a bunch of talking and when it was supposed to be scary, it was more funny than anything. As a horror movie, it was decent, but, not the scariest movie of all time. Reading some of the reviews, I wonder who's getting paid to sell this drivel."
4,Absolutely the most disturbing film I have ever seen,"Twenty five years and countless reviews later, The Exorcist still has the power to de-stabilize most people who feel they have delt with the issues that the film raises, namely demonic possesion. If you are of a nervous disposition or are not sure if you believe in the forces of darkness BEWARE!!!Natasha Osuna"
4,A Very Good movie!,"This is a very good movie. I watched it for the first time today. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Linda Blair does an absolutely outstanding job. There are parts that are difficult to watch, like when she stabs herself in her privates with the cross. It is a very good movie, however parts of it are silly like when the demon says ""Keep Away the sow is mine!"" Definetly worth seeing."
5,Help!!!!! WoW!!!!!!!!,"This movie was great it had a good story and creepy settings.But the movie itself isnt that scary its the freaking aftermath.I watched this movie at night on a friday when it was over I said to myself that this wasn't as scary as everyone said.Still the movie is cool dont get me wrong and scary after your done watching it. When i went to bed........... thats when all the freaky stuff happend, first I felt like that crazy girl was in my room then peeking through my window, but that wasn't the worse the worst was when I felt possessed. Im not playing around a voice in my head was telling me to go outside and i felt supper hot. I should have listen to my mom! Well just to be nice if you watch this movie and get a wierd fellin just shut the thing off. This movie is pure evil. But then again a great movie."
4,DEVIL IN THE FLESH!!,"this movie is wicked creepy. i loved it, it paved the way for all these other excorsism movies, but this one is definitly the best. the actors were great, the story was so believable, the makeup was good, and it was truly scary. not much can do that these days, but this one still can. a young innocent girls bodies possessed, killing her off slowly, making her do all these horrible things to herself. the mother helpless what does she do. her last resource the church. the priests who give their lives to help. the oldest battle in the book: good against evil. they must do all they can to save this little girl. all the while being taunted and lured by this demonic creature. excellent story and brilliant idea. from start to finish this movie was great. don't mess with things you don't understand. the head twisting scene: WICKED."
5,"It's scary, scary stuff...","I dont know what it was about this movie. I saw it last night and let me tell you..i was trembeling with fear. I've never felt that before..and i'm not one to get scared at movies. [Other horror films?] come on..this movie deserved best horror film in '73. I dont know if it is because of my religous beliefs, but after the movie i wanted to go to church..ha..thats' how scary it was. I've talked to people who arent religous and they say that it wasnt scary..so you be the judge."
4,Laser Disc Sound is Still Superior,"Visually, The Exorcist has never looked better. Finally I can see the brilliant composition of that opening shot with Merrin and the statue facing off against the backdrop of the setting sun. But I have to say, I played this simultaneously with my Exorcist Laser Disc and wow, what a difference. As much as I want to embrace DVD, it's really hard to do when the sound is infinitely inferior to LD. The DVD seemed to have no presence while the laser Disc cuts right to your bone. Especially in the surround noises. The LD jumps at you, giving me chills for the hundreth time, while the DVD just sort of whimpers in your direction. Maybe one day the two will be equal but considering the amount of compression required for a DVD, that is almost impossible."
5,The scariest movie I've ever seen!,"This is a scary,bloody,freaky amazing film. I love it this is so amazing it ranks on the same list as ""The Usual Suspects"" which is obviously the best film ever made. It's so great an amazing film. Great performances. I loved it. Definetly see it if not buy it.Great. When I heard they were adding extra stuff and releasing ""The Version You've Never Seen"" I ran out and bought it watched it, and loved it. See it!"
3,Slow shipping/no bundled savings,"The DVD came as advertised and is fine. Very, very disappointed in the vendor's shipping policy, however. Paid extra for expedited shipping based on the city listed and proximity to me. Also, paid full shipping for a second product, even though they shipped together. There was no option to save on shipping by ordering two products from the same vendor. The DVDs arrived well past the expected date and missed a critical birthday. Won't buy from this vendor again, despite the good products."
3,Stick with the original,"This is a 5 star movie, but the issue here is the added scenes. I was curious, being a fan of the original, but I can't help but feel the original cuts were justified. Especially so when it involved the extra flashing of the demon's face. More dicy is the flashing of Father Merrin's face at the window before Karras jumps, which adds a spritual clarity where ambiguity has long been the established tone for the film. To some extent, the additions are good for seeing the director's intentions, sort of like place markers, but the original cuts were wise and obviously considered since it impacted the tone of the move, thus adding an understated power to a very disturbing and scary movie."
5,Fun times,The reason I bought this movie is because of something that happened the night she saw this in drive-ins. Apparently my brother was a toddler and threw a rare temper tantrum. My mom swore up and down that my brother was possessed and she flipped out. lol Luckily someone else was able to calm him down and my mom realized that he wasn't truly possessed. This movie will make my mother laugh for sure when she opens it this Christmas.
4,And the Spanish subtitles?,"This movie is great.... and this new edittion really deserves to be buy, but in the box they announce spanish and portuguese subtitles, but when I saw it, it only had english and french subtitles. This is a big flaw for a big company like Warner, they should be more careful with the extras they announce. Well, about the movie: If you expect to see a lot of cool scary extras, you'll be dissapointed, there are a few scary ones (new ones), but the sound is really what impressed me, in some scenes the 5.1 really shocks you.... it's really scary."
5,About cute Linda Blair,While she is nothing short of excellent in this hit film does anyone agree she curiously turns in a better performance after becoming posessed then before.
4,Scary stuff,"I am a big film buff, and of all the multitude of movies I've watched this is the only movie that has ever truly frightened me. I saw it as a teenager and for weeks I dreaded going to bed for fear of being thrown into convulsions due to it's Satanic gyrations as in the movie. The Exorcist is scary and disturbing, even by todays standards, and still a classic."
4,Scariest movie I've ever seen!,This movie is one of the best horror movies I've seen. I love a movie that scares you. The actors performed a splended job.
4,Not as Impactful,"Saw it when it came out in the 70s and it was haunting- as an adult, the poor special effects and knowing the story and ending make it more campy"
5,What else can you say about the Exorcist?,If you havent seen the Exorcist then you should see it already. This is one of the best horror movies of all time.
4,BAD SEED IS BETTER!!,BAD SEED(1958) IS BETTER..AND WAS FIRST!!!But ''THE EXORCIST'' is still a real good film..the amount of DREAD in this movie is very unsettleing and the scene's with Raegan are some of the most clasick in any horror movie. But I do find it boring at moment's(BAD SEED DID NOT BORE ME!) and plus this is a little bit more fantasy than BAD SEED!!See it..but make sure you see BAD SEED as well!! you will like BAD SEED more if you like older movie's better!!
2,Disappointing,In the not so distant past Linda Blair indicated that a certain addition of The Exorcist also had a special feature regarding how they did some of the scenes. I mistakenly thought this was that addition. It is not.
4,A Brilliant movie...a fair DVD,"The Exorcist is the scariest movie ever made, and with this DVD, you get to see 11 minutes of footage that was cut from the original. Most of it is just talking between the characters, except for the ""Spiderwalk"" scene and a scene where Regan is diagnosed for a nervous disorder. The picutre quality is superb, also. However, the only special features are a commentary track with the director, 2 theatrical trailers, 6 TV spots, and 2 radio spots. By buying this DVD, you lose the ""Fear of God"" documentary that is on the Special Edition DVD. It would have been easier if they had just combined the two...maybe a ""Special Special Edition"" or something to that effect."
3,What was so frightening about this?!,"I thought this movie ver much draged. I know in many ways people find it a classic, but I just the plot was dragging. Some parts I admitt were entertaining"
4,Pitch Perfect,One night I was flipping thru the channels and my aunt came in and she said Ohhh! change it back.And a girl named Regan was swinging back and forth on her bed and I said That's freaky and then she turned her eye's all the way around and I closed my eye's.At night I was'nt able to sleep but it was a chilling movie for me.
4,A Horror Classic,Don't get me wrong I would give it a 5 but I want to be as honest as possible with this one. To be completely honest if you didn't get the original before the Never Before Seen one you really haven't missed much. All you really missed was her crawling down the stairs backwards although that was a very excellent scene. The rest of the never before seen footage was mostly conversasions. This movie although as a whole is a classic. The only problem with it really is the first half an hour. Some movies you have to pay attention to what goes on in the begining but most of the time they run slow and this one does. She damn near has to [urinate] on a rug to get the audiences attention but when she does that's it. This movie is a horro classic and will always be. Infact it originally hit theatre's with an x rating and was so powerfull that it almost cause two Miscarriages at the time of it's release. Very good film and highly recommended.
5,The One and Only,"This is THE Scariest film. Watch it as a horror film and take it seriously! Turn off the lights and watch it by yourself when your in the need for the biggest scare of your life. This is awesome. I rented Salem's Lot and this. I watched Salem's Lot first and thought"" dang this is the scariest movie I've seen, I guess this next one will be a le down."" ... was I wrong. This totally blew Salem's Lot away! The best horror film. Good acting, real people, great story, and excellent music make this gem a treat for any horror or movie fan. Superb!"
5,The Exorcist (Version You've Never Seen) is classic horror.,I only review the DVD's I buy. If I buy a DVD it has to be good. This movie is classic. I enjoy the added scenes and can't figure out why they werent in the original version. I particularly like the quick flashing ghoulish faces and the highlighted devil/statue scene in the dark bedroom. I very much enjoyed the directors commentary. And as always the widescreen/letterbox format is always the preferable way to view a movie. This one goes on the all time horror classics list.
5,Spooky Movie,"If by chance you believe in Heaven and Hell, this movie is spooky! Especially if you watch it by yourself!"
3,It's okay.,This was okay. It wasn't that scary. First time watching. I thought it would be more scarier. It was really boring with all the talking going on. Might return...
3,Does not play on a SONY player,I bought this movie and tried to play it on my SONY BDV-E800W player and the english audio would just play..I have read that it does not play on the BDV-E300W as well..
1,Keep your old tape,"Being an admirer of ""The Exorcist"" I didn't like ""the version you've never seen"" at all. They did a great job remastering the picture and sound. But I think the film lost something, something small but very important. It's like coloring black-and-white pictures, a kind of sacrilege. And the segments they added, added nothing new to the movie. So I will keep the old tape, the original release."
2,"Same Old, Same Old","I was surprised when Warner Bros. actually re-released this movie. I 'd already seen it, but thought I would see it again to find out what was so different. Big deal, there we're a few different scenes in the movie that the original did not have. This should tell you how outdated this movie is-when I saw it in the theater, There we're only two other people In there with me. In my opinion, Warner Bros. should have thought twice before re-releasing this one, cause It obviously didn't make any money, the second time around. If you have never seen this movie, it will probably scare you. If you have seen this movie already, don't bother seeing it again."
1,All Hype No substance,"I bought this movie thinking this must be hella scary since i've read so many people ranting about it. When it was done i've never wanted my money back so quickly. Not only did it plod along at a snail's pace, but the visual's were NOT scary. ""The Shining"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" were both 10 times better then this sorry excuse for a movie. the story was barely there and the conflict with the priest and his mother was just a worthless side story. in fact this movie feels like just a bunch of side stories without any link or merit. Avoid at ALL costs."
1,What the DEVIL were they thinking?????,"""The Exorcist"" was the scariest thing I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a bit. Now, I love to watch fun horror films, the kind that scare you but also give you quite a bit of entertainment, and even some humor. But, ""The Exorcist"" did no such thing. The film was way too scary to even entertain. All of the disgusting blood and the nonsensical devil spirit made the movie far too gross and horrific. Plus, the story didn't seem to be going anywhere. I admit I could be wrong. Maybe the story begins to get better. I only saw a little bit of it. Alas, the little bit I saw left me so frightened and disgusted that I didn't want to see anymore. For those of you who love scary movies, even if they aren't intellectually stimulating and entertaining, see this movie. But, for those of you who enjoy fun, suspenseful, intellectually stimulating and yet still horrific films, see something like ""Cape Fear"" instead."
2,Dull and silly,"This is one of the most overrated horror films (beside Night Of The Living Dead).It's dull and silly, and not scary at all.If you want to see real essential horror films, then watch The Evil Dead, Phantasm, Basket Case or The Thing, they are MUCH BETTER than this junk."
1,very stupid,I THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS VERY STUPID I EVEN SAW THE DIRECTORS CUT I SAW IT LAST YEAR IT WASNT EVEN SCARY COMPARED TO ALL THE OTHER HORROR MOVIES I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE DONT WATCH IT DONT WAYSTE YOUR MONEY AND I WAS ONLY 12 WHEN I SAW IT
5,PREPARE TO BE SCARED MORE THAN YOU IMAGINE,"This is THE ultimate horror movie. However, it goes beyond the typical blood and guts...it instills an instinctual fear toward the unknown - DEMONIC POSESSION! This movie depicts what is not only assumed to be real - it was based on a true story, not a directors imagination. If you keep that in mind while you watch this movie - i guarantee you will feel fear like none you've felt before - it is THAT frightening! This is the only movie that scares me more as an adult than it did when i was a child - because it takes advantage of what you know...and what you DON'T know about the underworld. ...So sit back, open your mind, and prepare to run to church - it's THE EXORCIST!"
4,This movie will compel you!,"It is amazing that a movie from 1973 can still have the effect it has today. The horror in this film is not horrifying, not a lot of chopped off heads or limbs or frightening scenes. But the overall atmosphere is just freaking frightening, especially helped by the special effects they used on the young Linda Blair and her acting which makes this move as scary as Jaws for example. You don't see a lot but it scares the hell out of you. I would not be surprised if people really got nightmares from this movie, too close to real life it is. One of the best horrors ever made"
5,"Starts slowly, but...","This movie is a worthy addition to your DVD horror library. It features a refreshing balance of drama and horror. The horror builds very gradually, almost seeping into the lives of the main characters. Great acting, great directing.Very highly recommended."
5,Quality Control and Industrial Statistics,"This book is the bible and handbook of Quality Control. It contains the important federal government sampling standards the Mil. Std. A very good and comprehensive reviews of Acceptance Sampling, Control Chart and Statistics. I recommand this book to Industrial Managers who work for the Quality Management."
4,Useful tool for Quality,I have used this book as a reference tool on many occasions in my quality engineering work.
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"I was looking for a basic CD of classic Christmas songs that could easily be sung along with. While I enjoy other types of instrumental Christmas music, often sung collections are either particular artists' ""interpretations"" (and thus hard to sing along with unless they're the original modern era) or are simply lacking in breadth (ten songs and that's it). This CD, however, contains a solid collection of classic songs, with no gimmicks, sung nicely by a full choir. The bright and briskly paced arrangements make it easy to sing along with, and I like the variety of familiar religious carols and some modern songs. All in all, a collection I'll be happy to play with my children around so they can learn all the verses to the classic carols. Recommended!"
1,Misleading,"America's 25 Favoritye Chrismas Song is not sung by various artist that you know. In this case ""various artist"" means unknown people, not the artist that one would associate with the songs. be forwarned.,"
1,Stay away!,"Oh jeez. This thing is a wreck. There's absolutely no musicality on the entire album. Mass-produced musical dreck to be avoided at all costs.I'm absolutely not a music snob, but this album hurts my soul. I've never regretted a music purchase in my life until today. I'm actually a little upset that Amazon won't let me give zero stars."
3,americas 25 favorite christmas songs,"I enjoyed the happy music of ""deck the halls"" it was beautiful but I still like the ray conniffs christmas songs. they are excellent songs for winter seasons."
1,Thanks O. Ivy!,"Ok, I really would like to thank O. Ivy for his DIY alternative. Screw spending $20 on extenders! I did exactly as he said, bought 2) 13""x 1/2"" black pipes, put them in the hole, and electrically taped them together when the orginal bar ended and the home bought bar protruded. However, I found a much better solution to the nickels. Instead, I used 3/4"" white rubber chair leg tips to go over the exposed end of the bar. Works great!!!! Don't buy the extenders! The bars, tape, and rubber tips cost only $5.34! Thanks again Ivy. Do it yourself is the way to go."
4,Worked for me...,"I do not know what problems the previous people had, but I followed the directions precisely and had no trouble, whatsoever. It takes a little finesse to get the extender threads in, but after that, worked like a charm."
3,Took O.Ivy's advice.,"I bought the IronGym extreme and my door frame was a bit too wide. Instead of buying the extension bars that got poor reviews I read what O.Ivy suggested and tweaked it a little. Worked perfectly and cost me $2.50 and was not difficult to do. I took off the caps on the ends and bought (2) 3/4"" diameter steel pipes from home depot that I had gotten cut to a length of 5.5"". Simply plugged in the pipe which fit pretty snug, electrical taped the steel bar and the original bar together and put the grip from the old end to the new steel bar end. Fit perfectly. FYI, IronGym extreme offers an extended long bar for 17 dollars but I could not find it on the website. It is on the mail-in offer sheet they give when you buy the product."
1,Save your money,"If you need these extensions, the door gym is probably not going to work with your door. I used it for a few weeks then it broke. Not recommended."
4,I have a confession . . .,"Technically, I haven't listen to this album. .I have thrown in this CD to, basically, relax or do work and I melt into what I'm doing.I have put it on, probably, six to seven times and have, only, noticed 4 songs:""Illumina"" by Maor Levi""Can't Sleep"" by Above and Beyond""Small Step On The Other Side"" by Basic Perspectiveand ""Get Off"" by Super8The first two were noticable because they are Vocal Trance.And the second two, I believe, were just catchy.I'm not saying that the album is bad. I just tune out when I listen trance music.Maybe, others may feel me on what I'm saying.So, . . . XM Radio has a Electronica/Dance channel called ""The System"". Above and Beyond has a weekly show every Friday at 10pm Eastern. This album is similar to what they play every week.So, Enjoy."
5,Good music`,Oldie but a goodie and my tape no longer works10 more words required??? Really? Really? I got to keep writing?
5,My all time favorite Christmas Album!,"I purchased this CD years ago, loaned it to someone and never got it back. I have looked for it for a few years, but have never found it in stores... It is my all time favorite Christmas Album!I will be listening to it all year long."
5,It's Not Christmas Without This One,"Everyone has their all-time favorite Christmas discs and this is in the top few around our house, and has been since its release on vinyl. Though I'm hardly in Ms. Grant's target demographic (as a 51-year-old male), I've followed her music since she was a teen and this in my opinion is one of her finest and most substantial efforts -- better, I feel, than ""Home for Christmas,"" her second Christmas disc which seems belabored and pretentious by comparison. The winsome ""Tennessee Christmas"" with husband Gary Chapman is as homey as smoke up the chimney, while her interpretations and adaptations of traditional numbers are fresh and inspiring. Her Christian faith shines through while not obscuring the fun and frivolity of secular numbers like ""Sleigh Ride."" A suggestion: use this fine disc as a warmup and then settle in for a transcendant experience with Kathy Mattea's ""Good News,"" a double helping of deeply-satisfying seasonal soul food."
4,Usedta love AMY the best but I'm moved on to GENIE,This is a good cd but kinda dated.I would get the 4 CD set by the Amish artist named GENIE before or in addition to this one.
3,Amy Grant's freshman Christmas effort quite good,"This is the first, chronologically, of three Amy Grant Christmas albums. Each subsequent album is better than the one before. Highlights of this album, for me, are her cover of Michael W. Smith's rather sparse ""Emmanuel"" and a new musical setting of the lyrics for ""O Little Town of Bethlehem"" - very fresh and somewhat exhilirating. I also enjoy the lovely ""Tennesse Christmas"" which I first heard performed by the country group Alabama."
5,one of the best!,"I'd had this CD before, seemed to have misplaced it, and just couldn't go another season without listening to it. I love the songs on this one! Thanks for fast delivery!"
5,A Christmas Must for me!!!,"I always have and still do love this CD! I used to have it on cassette, then had the CD. This Christmas, I couldn't find it anywhere, so I had to order a new one!"
5,A Christmas present...found!,"I looked all over in stores for this CD. It's my mom's favorite Christmas CD...I remember having the record album when we were little! She needed the CD, but we could never find it. So, I looked on Amazon, and there it was!Thanks!!"
4,"Very Enjoyable, Multi-mood Christmas Disc","This is a very enjoyable recording with a mix of old traditional tunes and newer ones, that you can either set on ""repeat"" play mode or mix with other favorite Christmas discs to good effect. ""Sleigh Ride"" is just a tad bit kitschy for my personal taste and I do like Ms. Grant's later ""Home for Christmas"" more because of some of it's more pensive and mysterious numbers; nevertheless this recording is a must for most anyone wanting to get in the Christmas spirit at home or in the car. I have both and they get weeks of continuous play every year."
5,Just a great Christmas CD.,"27 years after the recording of A Christmas Album, it is as good as any of Amy Grant's Christmas albums I own (I own all of them except the ""greatest hits"" one.) Her young vibrant voice gives meaning to all these songs."
5,A masterpiece from a wonderful singer,"There are some famous oldies here - Hark the herald angels sing, Sleigh ride, The Christmas song and Angels we have heard on high - all of which Amy sings superbly in the traditional style. Little town is actually O little town of Bethlehem given a completely different tune and arrangement. I'm not totally convinced by it but it's nice to hear an old classic done differently.The outstanding new song is, of course, Tennessee Christmas, which was written by Amy and has since been covered by Alabama, Steve Wariner, Lee Greenwood, B J Thomas, Bill Gaither and Porter Wagoner among others. Other notable songs here are Emmanuel, Christmas hymn, Love has come and Heirlooms.This is an album that gets better with each listen and it's a classic."
4,A delightful Christmas album from a talented singer,"Grant's first Christmas album is a perennial favorite. Her formula of homespun vocals and orchestral instrumentals got its start with this album.In particular, ""Tennessee Christmas"" and ""Emmanuel"" are the best songs on this recording. ""Sleigh Ride"" seems out of place among the rest of the songs."
3,Grammar book,The service in getting the book was great. I was suprised to find a few pages missing when I was using the book. Since it is a used book and it was only a few pages I am not suprised that this was overlooked. Gratefully this wasn't a huge problem.
1,a crazy man?,I thought this was a movie. It's a crazy man rambling on about this ufo mission he was supposed to make.I think this guy needs help.
4,Driven to drive!,"My son loves to drive, when he grqaduated to a little push-button (on the steering wheel) tractor to the bigger Power-Pull tractor & trailer, WOW!I'll Quote: ""I LOVE THIS!!"" over & over again and again..... !When I took the screw out so he could shift from first to second speed~gear, he paused and looked at my wife & I with a huge happy grin on his face....I had to drive sheet metal screws into the rear tires so he could continue driving during the New England Winter months!The hood assy. needs improvment, and a better way to attach the trailer. But other than that, it is GREAT !We are now seeking a second battery, cause this tractor has driven the life out of the original....."
2,Great rideon but disappointed with durability,"We purchased this toy for my 3yr. old for Christmas last year and of course he loved it. It was easy to handle and the locked shift gave us as parents the control of the speed. We also liked the fact that the battery lasts a while between charges. After 1 mth. of use, the hood cover broke due to the need to raise it for battery charges and the trailer would not stay connected. Soon after, the entire hood came off, it would no longer go in reverse, and the bar behind the seat started to detatch. After only 1 yr., we now have a tractor in pieces and a son who is asking for a different rideon toy. Everyone I know whe has purchased this tractor has had the same complaints. Even though my son loved it for the few months he was able to ride it, I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,angry 3 year old,"We purchase the john deer power pull for our 3 yr old son 2 months ago, and he has only been able to ride it maybe 1 month, we have already exchanged the product once and it is not running again! how disappointing for our son who loved this at first and now says ""I am angry my tractor doesn't work AGAIN"" when calling the company for parts it usually is an automatic 20 to 30 min. wait to talk and they wouldn't resolve an exchange so we went back to were we bought the product I do not recommend this product because all the problems (fenders, wiring harness shifter, 2 pins, weight on front, wheel, and same is happening to 2nd one) and this is all riding on an acre of level ground."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this toy for my son's birthday. After unscrewing the four screws to get the battery out to charge it (one i could barely reach) it was finally time for him to ride it. That lasted about ten minutes and then the reverse broke. So for the next hour my determined son would drive it get off it and push it to reverse and that was all good until the first gear broke also. So about [...] and an hour and a half later we had a big useless piece [...]. I would never ever even try to buy another peg perego product. I'm stickin with the power wheels.
1,not worth the purchase price!!!!,"we bought this toy in april for our sons fourth birthday. he loved it. the battery is very hard to get out, taking two parts off, then having to unscrew it. the hood broke off and doesnt stay on. the tailgate falls off. when you back up, the trailer doesnt turn with the tractor causing it to get twisted up. first reverse went , then first gear, now it doesnt run at all.it is very poorly made would never buy another one of their products again."
4,great fun!!,"My son got this tractor for his 2nd birthday. He absolutly LOVES it! I was a little upset w/ how the cart was so poorly made considering the brand the toy is. He got the cart twisted a little and it snapped very easily. Other than that, it rides very smoothly over grass. It's been a hit every time kiddos come over to play."
3,NOT THE QUALITY I EXPECTED FROM JOHN DEERE,"This is not our first powered vehicle, so I have alot to compare to. The battery does not last but about 35-45 minutes in a regular yard (no hills). That is just enough to make my 3 yr. old mad. Also, Our John Deere Power Pull arrived without any decals or stickers at all. (After a couple of contacts with the company, I'm still trying to get those sent to me.) I am not impressed with this experience."
5,Peg Perego Vehicles - highly recommended,"Both of my kids have one of these, as well as a Gator. They have been in the mud (don't recommend that), the cul-de-sac, & in the yard. Peg Perego offers new tires & batteries should you need them (see their website). Concrete/asphalt hills do wear the tires a bit. Keep that in mind if you have a steep driveway. (We've had 4 sets in 4 years on the Gator. I wish that they were made out of rubber!). Overall, this is an excellent vehicle. It can take the abuse from young kids."
3,Not very happy,"I Bought the Tractor for my 2 year old son for Christmas 2004. Two weeks after we bought it the hood will not stay on he rides and it falls off, it will not go in reserverse at all. I am totally disappointed in this product and would not recomend it to anybody"
2,Tractor not worth the money,"We got this tractor for our 3 year old son. He loves it! Rides it every day! But it is not well made. We have had it for 3 weeks. The trailer cracked when we put things in it. When our son backs up, the tractor runs the trailer over. The tailgate won't stay shut. The main front cover has already broken and will no longer stay on. Instructions said you could put a 12 volt battery in it (instead of the 8 volt that comes with it)but when we do this the front covers won't shut tight. We have bought power wheel products in the past. Our 2 children have used them for 3 summers with absolutely no problems. I will not buy any more products from the company that made this tractor. We are getting ready to purchase a kids ATV and we will definitely buy a power wheels because they are made to last. This tractor will not last! Even though my son loves it - it is made poorly! Don't waste your money!"
2,I got this for my three year-old last april for birthday.,"He loves it when it works, after the first month the reverse stoped working and the trailer broke off. we called the company and they sent a new switch nothing for the trailer. a couple of months later the second gear quit working and had to replace that. Then the reverse went out again and had to replace that. right now we have had it One year and second gear dosent work and it lost alot of power only one wheel turns. So if you are looking for something to last more than one summer than I really DO NOT recomend this. The company will not refund, I tried after the first month I had it."
4,A Blast when it works,"We bought this for my 3 year old son for Christmas. He test drove it for about 15 minutes and then we put it up. A few days later when he drove it the tractor would only go in 2 and a few minutes later the tractor wouldn't go at all. Both fuses for the gears had blown. I called Peg and they sent replacements. Since then the tractor has run great. He loves it and it will go on gravel, grass, sod, and dirt. It was somewhat discouraging when it broke only after a short ride but since I replaced the fuses it has run great. With this toy you should probably expect some problems but if you're willing to wait for replacements then your child will love it... mine does."
5,Crest of a Knave Jethro Tull,I didn't think I would like this. I am use to the old Tull. But I gave it a chance. It is a different sound but I absolutely love it. I can't stop listening to it.
2,Not Tull's best,"This CD ranks near the bottom of JT's material, but I'd like to use this forum to comment on the heavymetal grammy.It's true that JT are much more than a metal band, with their instrumental intricacy, taste and originality, but in the field of ROCKING OUT , any of the several incarnations of tull could wipe the floor with metalica pantera ,slayer or any of that crowd.Lars Ulrich vs Barlowe?Oh my God.I hit Lars level in my first year of playing drums.Hetfield vs Barre? heh heh heh!"
5,Jethro Tull 80's gem,This is one of my favorite albums from the 80's.Included on this disc is the singles 'Steel Monkey' and 'Farm on the Freeway'.As always great musicianship and vocals by Ian Anderson and great guitar work by Martin Barre.It is definitely a Tull album that's worth giving a listen to.Check it out.
2,My Least Favorite Tull Album,"I don't really care much for this album. Ian's voice here reminds me of a dried-up, raspy piece of rawhide. Maybe not necessarily a bad thing, but sad to hear compared to what it once was. The songs are not too great anyway. ""Steel Monkey"" is about the worst, in my opinion. The overall sound is maybe not so bad, if only I was born to some other language. The lyrics seem so sophomoric that I feel embarrassed when I listen to it, even while alone. ""Budapest"" is supposed to be really great -- Ian himself seems to regard it especially highly -- but it did not appeal to me at all. Kind of weird, I thought, and as a Tull fan I'm used to a bit of weirdness. ""She Said She Was a Dancer"" is better, in my opinion. ""Mountain Men"" was the one song on here I really did like. It would stand as a decent song on any Tull album.Well, there are lots of better Tull albums to spend your money on first."
1,pathetic,"Needless to say, there's nothing happening here. The songwriter has nothing to say; the singer (one and the same) can't sing. I was particularly dismayed at the quantity of robot music here, though. We have several songs with lifelessly programmed drum machines and (probably sequenced) cheesy synthesizers. A-V-O-I-D."
5,"Great Album, Right on to John S. Ryan's Review!!!","I really can't add anything to the words of the review I read here by John S. Ryan. He summed up my feelings (and a lot of other Tull fans and quality music lovers everywhere I'd imagine) by writing of the Grammy fiasco when Metallica was supposedly ""robbed"" of the Grammy by a deserving Jethro Tull. Thanks John for summing up the truth of this subject so eloquently."
3,A pleasure after the disastrous Under Wraps,"Tull came back pretty strong on this album. Metal heads were up in arms over its win for Best Hard Rock/Heavy Metal Album of the Year -- which they were right about! On the other hand, Tull deserved at least some sort of achievement award for their '70s work.Strong songs include Steel Monkey, Farm on the Freeway, Jump Start and Raising Steam."
5,"Great, classic Tull","This recording is wonderful, a stroll through mysterious Budapest, if you have an imagination (i.e: pre MTV) when you hear music, this will surely take you places. Each song invokes a different feeling. Very contemplative."
1,Scarry looking child!,"This was my first story we'd read by this author, but it had a lot of positive reviews so we got it. I thought the child looked scarry and evil at times. The story was basically about telling the child no a lot. Are we not trying to say no less so kids don't say no to us!! How about redirecting kids by saying instead of pulling over the fish bowl, let's look at the fish, or play with toys in the tub, etc. I would not get it again and will probably give away the copy we bought!"
5,"Fun, and sends the right messages","I was worried that this book would send the wrong messages (a book full of a kid misbehaving), but I trusted the other reviewers here, and they were right - this book sends the _right_ messages. Firstly, it lets your child feel both superior and empathetic - our child howls with gleeful recognition on each page of the 'no-nos' David is committing. Secondly, the fact that the child is scolded (not rewarded) for his mis-behavior, and that the book ends with love and a hug, reinforce parenting."
4,wonderful book for children and parents,"No David! is a wonderful book. As a parent, it is easy to forget to say yes to our kids, No David! lets us see what a child seems to hear all day long. The illustrations are colorful, fun and inviting. David is a delightful figure that all of us will see in ourselves and our children. Be sure to follow up by reading David Goes to School. Children and adults will enjoy this book for a long time!"
4,Fram Air filter for 2007 Toyota Sienna,"It Works, it is way cheaper than what the dealer wanted. It takes a little bit of time, as the airbox is located in a tight spot, but overall less than a 10 minute job."
4,Fram Air Filter,"It's the corrcet air filter for my car. It came quickly, it fits. What more can you ask for?"
4,FIt perfectly,I did not realize that I could purchase my automotive supplies from amazon. I got this filter for my wife's car. It fit perfectly and I saved a bundle.
1,It does not fit 2009 camry LE,"I compared with OEM. it is longer than my OEM.This air filter doesn't fit a 2009 Toyota Camry LE 4 Cylinder, however Amazon and Fram saying that it does.It is much too long by about an inch or so. I ordered one, tried it and am now returning it."
1,IT DOES NOT FIT !,FRAM claims this filter fits 2007 Toyota Highlander. It is actually a little bit too long. I tried force it in and broke 2 locking tabs and I regreted that I bought it.
1,Does not fit when the amazon interface says it does,Product states that this fits a 2007 Toyota Camry LE 2.4L when it doesn't; it was too big when I tried to install it. Amazon was courteous enough to issue me a refund without going through the trouble of sending it back to them.
1,doesn't fit my 2006 Toyota Highlander Hybrid,"Does not fit my 2006 Toyota Highlander Hybrid, despite what Amazon says on their web site. It's more than an inch off in both dimensions, so it's not even close."
1,Read before ordering: WRONG SIZE,"I double checked the year, make and model after I discovered the filter in the box was about an inch larger than the one in the car. Unfortunately, I waited until the weather was warm before deciding to change the air filter. Now I fear I am out of luck as it long past the expiration date for returns. It makes me wonder about my Prime Membership renewal. I am in the process of returning the filter. I wish I had read more of the reviews before ordering the filter, as there were several other customers with the same problem. I am guessing there is a data entry error somewhere in the bowels of Amazon's coding.Fram CA9360 Extra Guard Rigid Panel Air"
1,not even close to fitting car,"recently ordered an air filter for my 2010 Pontiac Vibe (has a Toyota engine) and was sent the wrong size, got a Toyota filter but not the correct one. Don't know how to return if that is possible."
1,dissappointing,"it was not a good fit, perhaps the wrong product was shipped. No more air filters online for me."
3,not sure about this product,"I bought this for its name, Fram. will try something else next time because it looks flimsier than what I had before."
2,This air filter is not for the 2009 toyota camry 2.4L,Fram CA9360 Extra Guard Rigid Panel AirThis particular part won't fit the designated make and model which is 2009 camry 2.4L. This error has to be corrected ASAP for I still posses this part in which I don't have any of use to it.
5,Don't forget to add the cabin filter,"Fit my 09 Toyota Highlander. It was easy to install and literally took about 5 minutes. I did not know before, but many new cars have a cabin filter too. It is worth replacing both at the same time. Mine was really dirty."
1,does not fit my car,"I have 2007 Toyota Camry LE. This filter does not fit my car, even though the site says it fits. The picture at the site is different from the product I received."
1,Does not fit 2005 Sienna,The filter will fit in the chamber but could not get the cover back on... The filters shape was not consistent with OEM filter and because of this the cover would not fit...
2,As Time Goes By,"I think that Acker Bilk is the best clarenetist ever; however, As Time Goes By is too jazzy for me. I prefer his more mellowmusic.."
1,Scam,"I purchased this product after being wooed by an infomercial. After 3 uses, it sprung a huge leak. Yes, it's covered by a 10 year warranty, but what they don't tell you is that it costs approximately $6 to send it back, and then you need to enclose a check for $5.95 to have it returned. If it's going to leak after 3 uses each time, do the math. Not a bargain.... There is no number to call to complain. And if you look online, there are many different manufacturers of this product and you have to locate the one you purchased from in order to get a chance at reaching someone-although most of them are order only websites. They obviously are making a killing off of unwary consumers. Don't buy this! And if you do, buy from a store where you can return it when it inevitably starts to leak!"
1,REEL BAD,"This was the third hose I bought for the new house, and as the other reviewers learned- another great idea, so poorly executed it is not worth taking for free.1) The hose must be entirely unwound before turning on the water, leaving a tangle of kinked, flimsy hose at your feet.2) Leave even a few inches on the reel (as I did) and the entire assembly explodes once the water starts running. The reel has no room for the hose to expand- so it presses against the cheap plastic reel and blows it apart.I've learned when it comes to hoses, you get what you pay for and quality is not inexpensive."
1,[bad],"I purchased this hose and in using it only a few times, it began to leak. I looked over the 10 year warranty and found that I would need to return the product via mail, pay the postage for returning the product, and include a check for $5.95 to cover the company's cost to ship a replacement. Thinking that maybe I had just gotten a defective hose, I returned it as specified and received another. Upon a couple of uses, the second one began leaking also. This product is a waste of money and I would advise anyone considering purchasing this product to decide against it."
1,This stuff is junk.,"I purchased three of these from a national home improvement retailer. On the second use, two of the hoses developed leaks near the couplings. It's a good idea poorly implemented. I do not recommend purchasing this item. (I give it one star only because the review system wouldn't let me leave a rating of ""-"")"
1,Junk,"Like everyone else, mine burst after three uses. I saved myself 12 bucks by just throwing the hose away. If yours breaks, I suggest you do the same. AVOID THIS PRODUCT LIKE THE PLAGUE."
1,Don't buy any of these types of hoses!!,"I bought a hose like this, but made by a different company. I wish I didn't waste the money. The idea is slick, but the product is far from it. The first time I used it, I unwinded the entire reel before turning on the water. The water was stopped by any little twist or flattened spot and gushed out the side of the hose. I was trying to clean out a birdfeeder, and ended up with wet shoes and a dirty, wet birdfeeder.Do not buy this, or any other flat hose unless you can personally try it out first."
1,Roll-a-Hose is a disappoitment and waste of money,"It's a great idea to have a hose that neatly rolls up and can be stored away. That is why I bought this hose. I used it every day for 2 months. Then the liner inside the hose split open in the middle and no water reaches the end. It is very important to let the ALL of the water out of the hose before you roll it back up. It is difficult to roll up the hose without it twisting around, which I suspect is not good for the liner seam. Also, rinse off the hose if it gets dirty before you roll it up. I think I'll stick to a standard hose."
1,HORRIBLE invention,"Is there a 0 star category?I got suckered into the dream of a flat folding host. It DOES NOT work. And once used, good luck trying to return it. Once water fills 50 ft of this ..., good luck squeezing it out. Remember, you need to pull out the full 50' before being able to use it.One of the fantastic advantages of such a flexible hose is that it kinks very easily! In order to use it, you need to have the entire 50' in a flat straight line! Ever wonder why firemen lay out the firehose before they can use it? And, that's with the full pressure of a fire hydrant to blast the water. Good luck building pressure to inflate this tube with your tiny 3/4 inch water supply pipe!To make matters worse, the material gets holes easily.I'd like to ... the genious who came up with this idea."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT -- I bought 4. They BURST as soon as the water went through.Amazon should STOP SELLING IT
1,garbage,"this hose was as much a pain to roll up and store as any hose.after 6 months of use, the inner tubing leaks in many many places. I will stick with ""normal"" hoses from now on."
1,Product is not what it claims to be... JUNK!,"I thought it was a great idea, but was wrong. The hose is very hard to wind up. Then the wind up knob broke off making it impossible to wind up. Both the male & female ends leaked and the hose had leaks along it. The hose kinks very easily and don't even think about walking on it, unless you don't want water. I tried to contact the company, but they are useless to deal with. It costs more to exchange the hose then it's worth. You would have better luck trying to wash your car with a spaghetti strainer (and would even get more water) than this hose. This is the only item I ever purchased that I would say... BUY BEWARE OF JUNK! Save your $$$ and buy a watering bucket. Good Luck if you decide to buy... Beware!!"
5,Mix MASTER on the DECKS!,If you like Fatboy's style then you'll love this CD. Don't hesitate when deciding to buy it-TRUST ME YOU'LL LOVE THIS CD. It's perfect for a party to just pop in the player and do whatever.
3,Not all good,"I admit there are some really good tracks on this album (specifically #1, 9, 10, and 15-19), but the rest are just OK/border on annoying. Sadly, I'll probably get 10 million people clicking the No, this review was not helpful button because I don't give every album a 5 star review. Oh well. Bottom Line: Buy this only if you are a diehard Fatboy Slim fan. Otherwise, just download the tracks I listed."
5,Simply the best DJ mix cd I've ever heard!,I work as a DJ and after hearing this I wanted to hang up my headphones. It's that good!
4,Variety at the expense of flow (but who cares?),"This CD covers a lot of ground. It goes from sped-up Jungle brothers through a whole lot of Skint label sort of stuff, some more traditional breakbeat/bigbeat, some heeeavy acid... it's very eclectic, and fun to listen to.The mixing strikes me as being a little bit awkward. The records are always well synced up and more or less in tune, but the transitions are both predictable and noticeably abrupt. Before hearing the CD all the way through, I had already developed a pretty good sense of when I would be hearing the next record come into the mix.Buy it anyway. This album is a lot of fun."
5,a-freaking-mazing,"This album busts a better move than your mother after her breakdancing lesson. But seriously folks, how this CD rocks! May possibly lead to booty-shaking..."
2,Pretty thin Fatboy,"Try ""Better Living Through Chemistry"" or ""You've Come A Long Way, Baby"" first, they are quite good.""On The Floor At The Boutique"" is an underproduced, confusing, thin sounding mix with very few high spots. Sound quality is akin to a basement tape or a bootleg recording. What little tempo and beat there is often lost through the song transitions."
2,Not worth the $$,"ECD Enhanced CD. aka ENHANCED PAIN IN THE A$$. I enjoy Fat boy as much as the next guy but really do i need the cd freezing my computer trying to fun flash or quicktime everytime i want to listen to it? I have many astralwerks cd's Fatboy,Chemical B.,Fluke all excelent quality entities. This ECD is a wash."
5,"Great product, be warned: It's been discontinued","Neutrogena Norwegian Formula Body Moisturizer Daily Therapeutic Lotion - Fragrance Free (15.2 oz) in the white bottle with the red and blue lettering has been DISCONTINUED by Neutrogena. Those sold online are all from the last lots produced. The product was officially discontinued by Neutrogena in June 2009. A great product done in by the marketing types or whoever made the ""business decision"" to discontinue the product. What in the world were they thinking? They've successfully found a way to lose a lot of customers."
3,Better Compilation of this Material Available,"The album has lovely melodies and interesting introspective lyrics. Not quite as eccentric and idiosyncratic as subsequent albums with Gabriel. More of a gentle pop feel. You can actually hear a Bee Gees influence on Silent Sun. Some people think the orchestration detracts from the recording, but it is done very tastefully (by the well-known Arthur Greenslade) to complement the band's arrangements, and doesn't intrude when the band's own instrumental playing (which was rudimentary at this stage of their career) is at its strongest.You would be better served by the British reissue of this recording on the Edsel label this year (March 2005). It has a second disc with extra demos, rough mixes, and rarities in addition to what is on this Japanese CD. And I believe it may cost less as well."
5,Ella and Tommy were MAGIC,"Ella performed with so many talented pianists over the course of her 50+ year career, and Tommy Flanagan was one of the best. He truly understood Ella and you can hear that in the music. This album (okay, it's a CD) captures the fullness of Ella's voice and the beauty of the music. Tommy's deft touch brings out the very best of Ella. Highly recommended."
1,An Unmitigated Disaster,"Being born and Raised in Flushing, Queens I am familiar with the long tradition and great reputaion of the FDNY. I thought this book would present an honest and indepth reference about the FDNY and firefighting. Unfortunately and Surprisingly, I was wrong. This book is in one word, a disaster. It's a travesty that this book was even allowed to be published. I am giving it 1 out of 5 stars only because Amazon.com did not allow me the option of giving the rating of 0 stars, infact I am writing a formal complaint to Amzon for not giving me the opportunity to fully express my strong feelings. (...)"
1,A piece of Malarkey,"I have read a lot of poor works in my day, but none have made me so angry as this one has, and I am not an easily excitable man. If it had not been for a skeet shooting accident when I was four years old, I would be a fourth generation firefighter in the FDNY and I have to say that this reflects poorly on the contributions of my ancestors. I personally placed my copy of the book in my kitten's litter box, and I would recommend that any other people who bought the book do the same, as it was less of a guide than it was a childish rambling.I'm embarassed."
1,A whiner who doesn't believe in the American way,Me and MANY others have posted SEVERAL truthful but negative reviews of this book only to have them taken down because the author doesnt getting bad reviews or low ratings. Whatever happened to freedom of speech? If you buy this book you are supporting someone that i believe to be a staunch communist. Joseph Natale Schneiderman is merely the penn name for former Serbian president currently on trial for genocide Slobodan Milosevic. DONT BUY THIS BOOK.
5,Great Book!,I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the FDNY in any way. Their are alot of great facts in this book and it is also fun to read at the same time. The author did a great job with this book. Oh and if you have been to the FDNY buffing this may bring back some memories as it did me. Its a great book!
1,OUTDATED INFORMATION - Dont buy this book!,"I read this book and its from too long ago to help you. The information is very outdated and a lot of the rules it states no longer apply and have been completely changed. A better source of Savings Bond information, always up to date, www.SavingsBonds.com.Again, unless you want to have to re-learn everything you know about bonds, dont buy this book!"
3,Small book with a few good insights though limited,"as the author complains by lack of personal source material. Buford died during the war, had no surviving children, didn't write any kind of memoirs etc... Longacre did a solid job of discussing the union cavalry command but many aspects of the book like sections on Gettysburg and West Point seemed rushed. Certainly many other commanders had nice things to say about Buford unfortunately Longacre only found 1 or 2 of them."
3,It could have been so much more.,"A good but not exceptional biography of this long neglected cavalry commander, but there is a lack of any real new insight and personal detail about this man. It seems to have been pushed through the research, writing, and publishing process too quickly to be of any real use to a serious researcher."
4,A lesser-known leader brought to the forefront,"In a period with so many personalities around whom legends have grown, it's refreshing to see a lesser-known but hardly unimportant character from the Civil War given respectable attention. Buford found some prominence as a personality at Gettysburg, but his career has been given scant attention over the years. Longacre's account is relatively short and to the point, with most detail being rightfully reserved for the events at Gettysburg. Buford's ability was certainly validated years after his death, as his methods of combat became a model for future leaders. The book succeeded in giving me--a good ole southern boy--a whole new respect for one of the Union's most effective fighters."
3,"A little shy on detail, but a good read","As the author states, there isn't a lot of source material available for Buford research, so given that, I think Longacre did a credible job. The book is short and very straightforward, so don't go looking for in depth examinations or startling revelations, but as an overview, it's an enjoyable read."
3,a valient try,"A very decent effort on Buford, but even the author admits he was reluctant to write a bio on this important, but obscure Civil War figure as there wasn't much original resource material to rely on. He decided to go through with the project after the movie Gettysburg came out in which Buford played such a dominant role on the first day. but the basic lack of resource material shows over and over in the book as the author is reduced to infering what Buford thought, and in some cases what he actually did. Still, there is much to learn here about this gallant soldier."
3,Gig Bag,"Great color, sturdy material. My only complain is that it seems unnecessarily bulky. It's pretty thick and a bit heavy. I got used to the size change from my old gig bag after a few weeks."
2,This case wasn't what i expected,"I bought this case about 2 weeks ago because i had a hard case that didn't have a strap and it was hard for me to carry it around school with books in my hand, and when i got it, it looked different than the picture shown here. Maybe its an updated version or something but i definitely didn't like it. It was way to big for me and it was bulky. I can say that it has very good storage, like the front pocket the inside music holder and little compartments but for me, being short as i am and having to carry books and stuff around school was going to be very hard. I don't really recommend this case for high school students; maybe for college students."

4,"Predictable, but Entertaining",Decent special effects and an OK storyline get you through to the characters that make this film better than average.
2,WAIT FOR ALIEN 5 INSTEAD,"After suffering through DePalma's ""Mission to Mars"", I thought I'd better give this one a chance. Why not, since our library has recently stocked their shelves with dvds? It sure beats the price of a rental.This is also an only-for-hard-core-sci-fi-fans flick, and nothing else. The element of a hi-tech robot gone awry just doesn't work anymore, ever since the Lost in Space TV series. The well-seasoned actors can't save this production, making one fast foward certain scenes (you got to figure maybe that's why Terrance Stamp was to be the first to go).It's disappointing to say the least. The only good space flicks ever made are the ALIEN series. Like Mission to Mars, I can't recommend Red Planet to anyone."
2,"Interesting, but boring and desperate for attention.","At least ""Mission to Mars"" had an interesting ending and gave us something to think about. Not to say that ""Red Planet"" was a total waste. The special effects were good and the idea was inticing, but overall, director Anthony Hoffman didn't make much of the material he was given. The film drags and desperatly searches for ideas to keep us interested. It doens't know who the bad guy is or what's going on half the time. First the robot is trying to kill Val Kilmer and his crew, then little aliens are jumping out at them. If the film could make up its mind, then maybe we would care (or know) what the heck was going on."
2,It should have stayed on the dark side of the planet.,"For the quality of actors that they had in this the movie was garbage. From such top notch people they created a slow paced, cliche of a film. It never picked up and the odd clever idea was simply lost in lack of plot and over all concept. It could have been so much more than it ended up being."
3,Gilligan's Island on Mars,"Some of the material in ""Red Planet"" is way too advanced for the common moviegoer (a lot of technical talk), but the most tense scenes involving cliffs, losses of oxygen and rescue devices with only space for two are easy to follow as well as entertaining. The scenery of the planet is really dazzling and spectacular. Some of the plot is undeveloping, but the acting in this is above average. Give it a chance."
2,MISSION TO THE RED PLANET(Mars?),"When I think of this movie as a sci-fi movie, I get a CGI headache. I even understood MISSION TO MARS, but all I could tell is that when Val met Carrie, it was love at the next first mission to space, everyone else probably signed off to do other more intelligent movies. One of the more suprising elements of this movie was the addition of Terrance Stamp. His appearance was almost as awesome as Robert Forrester in Supernova, but like supernova his character died almost halfway through the plot too. As far as the plot goes, I could tell what was going to happen, from start to finish, which I think makes the movie so disappointing, especailly with the old ""the escape ship will only support two"" routine. So, I guess all-and-all the rest of the movie was fine, just pretend, I'm serious."
2,Couldn't even finish it...,"The basics of redundant system design and standard safety protocols have been ignored to create a well-acted, good looking flick that I can't believe for more than a few minutes straight. Does anyone make sci-fi for smart people?Watch it and wince!"
2,I didn't like it.,"I'm not sure what this movie was about. It had all of the hollywood cliches such as a nude shower scene, the older astronaut dies tragically, one astronaut turns on the other and murders him, there's man eating bugs, a murderous robot, and a star trek style fight scene where he outsmarts a robot with his ingenuity. Its ironic that the guy is saved by a russian spacecraft since american movies always make fun of Russians even though they've put more astronauts in space than we ever have been able to.The breathable air thing was odd. All that equipment and they forgot to check the air on mars when they landed? Could have saved them a lot of trouble if they stuck to the post-landing checklist.I thought ""Mission to Mars"" was much better, indicating how bad this movie was. Mission to Mars was hokey but at least it had an interesting plot."
1,"Boy, am I glad I rented it first","Compared to Mission to Mars and Pitchblack this movie ""bites"" !!The plot is allright at first, but the execution is plain awful. This movie is so slow that it's like watching a documentary. Bad acting, bad story, bad special effects, bad everything. Avoid at all costs !!"
4,It is a good SCI-FI movie.,"I like all the actors that made this fun to watch. What could happen if we went to MARS is usually a good basis for a movie, I like survival movies too. This fits in both categories."
3,"Excellent visual experience, plot falters","Red Planet offers an intriguing visual depiction of a trip to Mars. Where Red Planet falters is in its plot, with too many implausible hazards for our brave Mars-onauts. For the first 2/3's of the film, I was able to suspend disbelief and engage in the experience. But then a series of unrelated disasters breaks the mood. Any one, or even two of these hazards would have been enough to propel the action. So instead of being a legitimate grown-up thriller, Red Planet leans more toward the realm of fantasy, losing some of its emotional impact."
4,Pretty good actually,This was way better than I thought it would be. Always entertaining with good acting and action. Not at all a waste of money.
5,Good Drama,This was an excellent movie about what people in 2000 though the world would be in a quarter century. It would be nice if we were still trying to achieve these lofty goals.
3,Not partucularily exceptional.,"However, pretty pictures and somewhat coherent plot. You even wanted to see what was going to happen next. I watched it once, and I would not PAY to see it again."
4,Better than average sci-fi fare,"Red Planet has flaws (many of the plot twists are fairly predictable, some of the science is screwy), but overall is a pretty good value pick. Kilmer's wise-cracking ""space janitor"" is a character we can care about, Sizemore provides good counterpoint, and Moss is an eyeful. The problem-solving aspects of the plot lift it above the morass of most sci-fi; the characters actually use math and old Mars probes to try and save themselves, and ANY movie that features realistic, scientific approaches to solving problems is OK in my book. I teach science in a public high school, and actually use some clips from the movie to illustrate problem solving. This is not high-art science fiction, but neither is it campy or schlocky; Red Planet has some intelligence and wit, which makes it pretty good in my book."
1,BAD Movie,"Space Janitor Pat and Thomas do a GREAT movie! And it gets exciting when... Oh wait, Thats version I made up to entertain myself during the movie. Anyway, somehow people get killed on the spaceship so they go to Mars. Where the die one by one. Stay away from this!"
1,It is bad.,"I'm sorry, I have to go with the bandwagon here. Red Planet is truly a bad movie. Not only does it feature a story that simply isn't very interesting, it also has lousy acting and direction. It just doesn't venture into anything interesting. I don't mind a plot that seems familiar, but when Red Planet rips off from uninteresting movies, you know that's a problem."
4,FUTURE TECH,"THIS IS TYPICAL MOVIE FARE. THE STUDIOS ALWAYS GO WITH A STANDARD ""RECIPE""VERY GOOD CGI.DECENT PERFORMANCES.GOOD SETS.LAME STORY.SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN SHOT IN AUSTRALIA.MAY BE A FAIRLY ACCURATE PREDICTION OF MID 21ST CENTURY TECHNOLOGY.WORTH EVERY CENT OF THE 86 CENTS I PAID FOR IT!SUMMED UP: CHEAP ENTERTAINMENT. WORTH YOUR TIME IF CABLE OFFERINGS FAIL..."
4,"I liked it, but i could have been much better.","Red Planet, starring Val Kilmer, Terrance Stamp and Carrie Ann Moss, and directed by Anthony Hoffman, it's quite more smart than ""Mission to Mars"", and more entertainig,but still it fails:The perfomances were all great, but Ann Moss didn't did even a good perfomance, it was very lifeless, and she didn't looked an good as an astronaut, also I think that the movie was too easy, and fast, I think it should have more things in it, but still it's quite a great buy, and i give it four stars, just for the FX, most of the acting, music, entertainment value, and smartness."
4,Entertaining Film with Some Good Plot Twists,"This movie gets off to a fast start and doesn't slow down and has an element of mystery about it too. Things happen that are unexpected and keep the viewer wondering what is going to happen next. The overall ambience is good as is the acting; the mars landscape looks formidable, alien and a long way from home.A very smooth journey to Mars is interrupted by a nasty surprise that puts the whole thing at risk; the movie focuses on the efforts of the crew to correct the problem and get back home. There are problems on the ground and problems with the ship in orbit that challenges the crew and gives the viewer an exciting ride.The story has some interesting surprises that show imagination and holds the viewer's interest. It is fun to watch, I recommend it."
3,I like Carrie Ann Moss,"Great to see a very strong female role but disappointing to see Kilmer playing such a sexist role. The plot gets a little long-winded but the special effects are great. If you want to watch something different, this is something to consider."
4,Mars,"I had seen this movie before, and liked it. Plausible storyline with lots of action, sort of mirrors ""Mission to Mars"". Lots of space shots. You could almost watch the two films together as a “mission one” and a “mission two”. Both movies had first rate actors in them."
5,Red Planet,I watched this movie on TV and missed the end of it because it was on too late and on a school night. I enjoyed the parts I did get to see and had to see the ending. I really enjoyed it. Thank you.
3,entertaining,"Still an entertaining movie, not the best Sci-fi but worth the few minutes to watch and enjoy especially for four bucks."
5,Red Planet,DVD was very entertaining.DVD arrived in a very timely fashion.DVD arrived in excellent condition.
4,Far better than most reviews indicate,"I've watched this movie on DVD at least 30 times now and haven't gotten tired of it yet. The storyline is interesting and, compared with most SciFi films, eminently reasonable. Each of the characters has a distinct personality. Kilmer, Moss, Seizmore, and Stamp are superb, giving compelling although generally subdued performances. The special effects are excellent but not overdone. If you are at all interested, at least rent it. You may well find youself buying a copy."
4,A fun romp thru the science fiction world..,"I think this is a great movie. I like it simply because it lets me escape reality for a little over an hour and a half. See, I love movies, and I don't expect them all to be cinematic masterpieces. You gotta throw some [bad ones] in there too.This movie is by no means a great science fiction movie. It is, however, fun. What would happen if we were able to go to Mars? This is better than Mission to Mars, because this one deals with scientific situations more than theological. Granted, you do have Chantilas and his God theories, but thats about it.If you want a fun romp through the galaxy, see this."
4,Classic 1950's Science Fiction.,"Red Planet isn't a great film, nothing worthy of Oscars, but it is a fun film to watch. Believable characters and mostly believable science, or at least a good imagination. Also the mysteries of the movie are explained less on the fantastic level, but more on a realitic approach than the ancient Martian civilaztion from Mission to Mars. Another nice aspect was the humor that was brought along for the ride - real good stuff. I watched it on DVD and that is where my only complaint is at, which is to say that there wasn't alot of extra stuff on it. A very entertaining movie and worthy of watching - enjoy."
4,Good Sci-Fi but not for everyone,"I enjoyed Red Planet,I thought Val Kilmer had a very good performance in this picture too bad he has deteriorated over the past several years. Carrie Ann Moss was very beatiful and dare I say sexy, I had forgotten how good she looked without all the goth wear in Matrix. Back to the movie if your used to seeing killer aliens or rampaging mutations and other murderous life forms then this is not the movie for you. This is true science fiction here where the only demons and monsters are the ones we bring with us. Don't pass this movie up, I recommend it."
4,UNAPPRECIATED MOVIE,"You cant miss this movie just because mission to mars was a little weak.This dvd has amazing color and sound, both 5.5 quality.It only screws up in two places it seems alittle familiar,and it kind of wastes terance stamp and benjamin bratt.The movie is basically a survivor story with a really cool navigational marine weapon called ""amee""running around stalking the unarmed crew, giving it a boost of tension and action. dont miss it."
2,Completely forgettable.,"I'm not afraid to admit it: I genuinely loved Mission to Mars, one of the most enthralling sci-fi adventures I've ever seen and the film I'd point out as the most underrated of all-time. That film was a magical experience, inspiring a sense of awe that I thought would never be achieved after Robert Zemeckis' even more wonderful sci-fi drama, Contact.Now we have Red Planet, a similarly plotted film that's admirable in its simplicity and lack of flash, but it's dull, uninteresting, and unexciting. The visuals are good, but none of it is compelling, the story is basic and predictable, and except for an interesting little subplot about life on Mars, this film fails to do anything different. True, it does harken to the style of 80's sci-fi thrillers, something I do enjoy, but when we've got a movie as boring as this one, what difference does it make?"
3,Entertaining Sci-Fi Movie!,"This movie was made to entertain people. It is not a brilliant movie by any means. But the concept in it are facinating. Putting moss and other plants on Mars to make Oxygen.Its entertaining, and a fun movie. It will be good to play when a few friends are over. It doesn't require a lot of thinking, but it keeps you entertained. Buy it!"
3,Interesting Angle,"The idea of sending man to Mars stirs man's innermost imagination, and since in the next thirty years such a journey may be launched, films such as 'Red Planet' have interesting relevance. While 'Mission to Mars' is a better film, 'Red Planet' is more exciting, and certainly scarier. Thus my own reservation with the film- portraying Mars in the most hostile terms. Even from what we know of Mars today, such pernicious parasites are possible, but not likely. In short, if you watch this as pure sci-fi, you will enjoy it. If you start deconstructing, however, you will be disappointed. As we prepare to colonize Mars, films such as this may one day be looked at (from bubble homes on Mars) as true 'classics'.So enjoy, amigos, its a fun movie."
3,A good Sci Fi movie,"A good sci fi movie & its even better than mission to mars but dont expect too much from it , coz it`s a 1 time view movie then you`ll forget it by the next day , dont get me wrong it`s an entertaining movie. im a big fan of Val kilmer & he`s performance was cool in this movie . the ending is really wonderful :)"
5,Best and most intelligent space travel film in decaces!,"It is almost an iron-clad rule in sci-fi films to base plots on the flimsiest of 'scientific' premises. In most cases there is no attempt whatsoever in even acknowledging proven foundations and principles of physics and other sciences. Poetic license runs amok in violating such foundations. (Tele-transportation? warp speed? ... P-L-E-A-S-E! Give me the scientific citation!)This film does not insult your intelligent in that it offers a very tight, exciting and coherent plot that is based on proven scientific principles, while evoking conjectured missions of exploration of Mars currently being investigated. (Please refer to the Mars Society website.) And yes, the plot also includes well fleshed-out characters, and inspiring themes of personal faith and redemption - along with a terrific cast!"
1,Almost as bad as Battlefield Earth,"This movie and Battlefield Earth are two of the worst Science Fiction movies I have ever seen. Boring, full of cliches, bad acting, cheap looking CGI robot, utterly pathetic."
4,I've always liked this movie,"I like Val Kilmer. Terrance Stamp was also very good in this movie as is Carrie-Ann Moss. This movie has always been one of my favorites, but I don't know if I can adequately explain why."
3,ONLY DIE-HARD SCI-FI FANS WILL DERIVE SOME ENJOYMENT FROM THIS MOVIE...,"It is the year 2057, and the earth is depleting its oxygen supply. A crew travels to Mars to see about potentially colonizing it. When they are close enough to Mars to touchdown, things go haywire, forcing all of the crew, less their commander, to abandon ship on the commander's orders.The crew manages to land on Mars, where they discover that things are not what they seem. They are in for a few surprises, as well as a mounting body count, as here, too, things begin to go haywire. Meanwhile, up in space the commander has managed to salvage their spaceship. Will the crew make it back to the ship? Will the Earth be saved? Watch the movie, but be forewarned that it will probably only appeal to die hard sci-fi fans. Despite an excellent cast, the movie tends to flag."
4,Kilmers Performance Worth the Ticket,"This is by no means a Matrix or Alien!Now with that out of the way it is a much better flick that I thought. The plot is meaningless but provides a nice canvas for some suspense, style, romance and effects. The standouts are:Val Kilmer - beautifully underplayed cool geek. Anyone who is aware of the mystique that geekhood can hold will see how well he nailed this roleAmee - Cool, loving and frightening dog/robot. She deserves an acadamy award (or a least a golden globe- *grin*)Carrie-anne Moss - Tough and oh so sexyNice pace - never slows down and has lots of cool toys.So it is not benchmark cinema but is certainly worth a look in.M"
3,"Impossible problem after impossible problem, boring","This movie was boring and non sensible for several reasons. First, the five man crew on Mars seemed to face impossible odds, where they sit and wait to die for five minutes with each problem, before some miracle saves them. Such as there is no air on Mars in reality, but at the last second when the crew is out of air, they then discover the air is breathable. Another impossible odd is when their own surveillance robot gets damaged then goes against the crew, just when you think the crew will die, the robot merely runs away. I am very open-minded, but the more amazing things I saw with the movie it just became an insult. It simply gets ridiculous how many killer problems the crew has to go through, and the 5 - 10 minutes the film kills time making the viewer believe that they will actually die. The special effects were great, but they can be seen in any other movie about space."
1,No good.,"Red Planet is a sci-fi thriller that goes nowhere. It has a decent cast, some impressive visuals, but little of anything else is worth even slightly mentioning.Let's go over the acting. Val Kilmer is okay, Tom Sizemore is actually pretty good, but Carrie-Ann Moss is lifeless. Not only that, I have yet to see what the hype over her is. She constantly has some sort of glazed look in her eyes and she's not nearly as good-looking as everybody says she is. I'd choose Connie Nielsen from Mission to Mars over her any day."
1,This is a great movie to put on if you are having a hard time falling asleep on your own,"I got this movie in a 3-fer blu-ray package which consisted of ""Red Planet"", ""2010: The Year We Made Contact"", and ""Contact"".It's interesting that they made this the first movie listed in the 3-fer so that you'll think that it will be just as good, if not better than the other two films in the package.I don't think I'll ever watch that yawner ever again. I can't understand how any writer or film producer could think that this story would be cherish by anyone. What a bore and a half."
1,Horrible movie,"Not worth my time. Everything was terrible about it - the story, the acting, the scenes - very amateurishly done - ugh!"
1,Too unbelievable.,"This is seriously the best that the world could gather to send to Mars? Seriously? No, really, are you freaking serious???? Their world deserves to die. Really. I shut the movie off after 15 minutes because I know better. It plays out too much like a frat house get together rather than a mission to save humanity.Every other website out there that's reviewed this got it right. 14% on Rotten Tomatoes should have told me something!"
3,"Good flick, just needs some characters","I am a SF junkie and will watch just about anything - even if I don't like it. Red Planet - With Carrie Moss, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore and Terrance Stamp - isn't in that category but it teeters at times.The special effects are not bad.The science IS bad, and inconsistant, but since this is a movie and not a documentary, so I suppose that's allowable.I would have loved to see more Terrance Stamp.The relationships between the crew are not well explained and take unexpected turns here and there. The flashback- oh yeah - this happened - scene to explain the Kilmer-Moss relationship irritated me. Why on earth (or Mars) not show it as it happened - then we might all understand the situation. At times, I was wondering ""Why are they acting like this?""Not bad - SF fans will still like it - keep expectations low.Mike"
4,"Red Planet, one of the better Mars movies","When I first Watched it, my eyes and ears were hearing a symphony. This is becuase, over the last few years, there have been a lot of Mars movies. Mission to Mars for instance, which gave me weak impressions about ANY sequels. Yet, when I put Red Planet in, I was finally seeing a better crafted movie based on our nearest planet. Val Kilmer soared, with perfect acting right down to the tense moments where he.... opps, don't want to spoil it for you! Anyway, Carrie-Anne Moss did one of her pbest performances since The Matrix. The supporting characters also added a bit more flavor to the scenes. Like Antony Hoffman, who played a want to know it all scientist. There were still some areas missing from the storyline, but it is my top pick for any Sci-Fi movie lover. Also, if you like good acting, a well done script, and a great cast, I suggest you watch Red Planet!"
4,Good action adventure,"No doubt you have heard some of the bad reviews of this movie, but it is'nt supposed to be a realistic tale of mans' first step on mars. This is a good action adventure story with reasonable characters, great hardware and excellent special effects. I say reasonable characters because the script (well - the final cut of the movie) does'nt give chance for the characters to shine, but because of the great cast, and good chemistry between Carrie Ann Moss and Val Kilmer, this movie is well above average and thoroughly enjoyable. Lets not forget the soundtrack is top notch too."
1,Wacky Adventures,"The mysterious Thomas and the hapless Patrick make Red Planet a true genius of a film. The suspence really gets open when Thomas' exlaims....No, wait... That's another, imaginary, but doubtless better film.Red Planet is one of the worst movies, ever. Mission To Mars was very derivitive of other sci-fi films, but it had an attraction. RP, on the other hand, revolves around hacking the ""off the shelf"" modem of Sojourner to quick call Earth and warn them that killer beetles have oxygeniated the atmosphere while the killer robot, running in ""military mode,"" tries to kill them all.Really.Awful movie."
1,BORING!,"Red Planet is a boring sci-fi movie ever! no wonder it's fail at the boxoffice last year.The story is weak and not much action in it,the robot name amee is the wrost cyborg ever.I watch this movie and it make me sleep at the half of the movie,I can't beleive my brother buy this DVD.If you want to see it,I suggest you rent it.END"
2,An empty Sci-Fi thriller,"This is one of those movies where you're just waiting for something to happen but never does. It just meanders along and relies on its special fx, which are quite good, to give the movie any substance at all. A couple of good performances by the cast without being outstanding, but there was only so much they could do with a shallow script. They look lost and wanting to give more but are restricted. There are better, a lot better sci-fi movies out there than this one. Special features aren't very interesting either."
4,Not Bad - seen lot worse,"Not bad - entertaining, I guess that's what movies are supposed to do... at least it passed the time. I do like this type of adventure movie.."
2,Bland but watchable sci-fi epic,"RED PLANET(USA/Australia - 2000)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS2050: Sent to investigate the failure of a science project on Mars, a group of astronauts become stranded on the 'red planet', at the mercy of a dangerous, malfunctioning robot.Antony Hoffman's good-looking space opera is a bland but watchable enterprise, toplined by Val Kilmer, Carrie-Anne Moss, Benjamin Bratt and Terence Stamp, in which a group of disparate characters are cast adrift on an alien world and forced to endure a series of life-threatening crises. Hoffman and his scriptwriters (Chuck Pfarrer and Jonathan Lemkin) pull few surprises out of the hat, and some of the computer-generated visual effects are too fake-looking to make much of an impact, though performances and production values are uniformly fine. Released at the same time as Brian DePalma's equally lackluster MISSION TO MARS (2000)."
3,A Good Sunday Afternoon Movie,"I just saw this for the first time on HBO and I found it a pretty decent movie. I remember wanting to see it when it came out eight years ago but the bad reviews kept me away. I think it ages well though. It is extremely light weight entertainment which makes it fit for a Sunday afternoon baseball rain delay. When I was a boy the local station showed the movieRobinson Crusoe on Marson Saturday and Sunday for what seemed like every weekend of my youth, and I watched it every time. This movie reminded me a lot of that. It's kind of silly with a aspirations toward hard science fiction but with questionable reality. The acting helps sell the more unbelievable aspects. Everyone sets just the right tone even Val Kilmer, who can sometimes over do it. The special effects were pretty stunning but tasteful and reminded me of 2001: A Space Odyssey in some respects. I think I could see myself as a child watching this every Saturday and Sunday."
2,GAH! Can you say fast-forward?,"<i>Red Planet</i> has a great cast plopped into stock-character formulations. The script reveals more about the writer than those characters: an awareness of what The Big Issues are, but nothing to say about them. The special effects and future-concept are fun to watch as is the gorgeous camerawork directed at Carrie-Anne Moss. On balance, a waste of time."
4,Way better than Mission To Mars!,"I'm fond of Sci-Fi movies so perhaps I might be a little biased towards them, but this was a very good movie. The premise was a little off...I mean messing up the earth to such a degree in the near future seems a little far-fetched, but I'm not a scientist so what do I know. The acting was pretty decent, although of course none of the characters are Royal Shakespearian quality...The plot was compelling, the special effects first rate. Music score blended in very well with the scenes and the charaters. Character developement occured right away and gave enough insight into their minds. There could have been a little more action in my opinion, but I guess it wasn't that type of movie...enough drama to keep your mind busy though...I'd recommend this movie to anyone interested in Sci-Fi, or whomever enjoys a decent drama/thriller..."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT...,"It is the year 2057, and the earth is depleting its oxygen supply. A crew travels to Mars to see about potentially colonizing it.

Despite an excellent cast, the movie tends to flag."
4,Wish there were more extras,"I just love this film -- the story is engaging, the characters interesting, and the special effects are first rate. I just wish there were more extras included in the package. A lot of work must have gone into this and the people who did it all should be acknowledged."
3,Clean clear wipe-PITA to install,Title says it all. I figured a Denso product would work great on a Toyota. The swivel adapter is very hard to use and instructions very vague and poorly illustrated.Update: 9-17-09 To update that they do not wipe quietly and dance(jump) across the windshield on the upstroke. Not recommended.
4,Very Good,"The story is way too adult for a comic book character. In fact it is educational. Superman believes that everyone would do the right thing if only they knew how profitable it was. He's not angry, he feels sorrow for our faults."
1,Disappointment,This book just was not that good. It is an older book and the story shows but it is poorly done.
4,Another great outing from the '57 Blue Note sessions,"For those who where lucky to get a copy of the Mosaic #154 The Complete February 1957 Jimmy Smith Blue Note Sessions (3CDs or 5 Q-LP) box, this CD is an overlap. But who cares, the sleeve must be in every serious JOS collection. The solo organ works on ""All the things you are"" and ""Zing"" are surprisingly modern and display the JOS mastery on controlling both manuals and pedals and modern approach to the tunes. Art Blakey sitting in with an organ trio on a few tracks is probably the only recording ever made with Art with organ (no organists in his official discography). Eddie McFadden on guitar delivers like many of his supporting role with organists. This session is classic for the '56 - '59 period at Blue Note but it's not the highlight from the same period even when you get approx. 20min with bonus tracks from the original LP."
4,s&p shakers,These are very nice shakers. They are solid and well made. I really like them.I use them regularly when I am cooking and then they may be set on the table to use also.
1,Smashed and Cracked.,"I bought this item, along with other things, in anticipation of an upcoming move. As I unpacked the pieces when I moved in (after the allowable return date), I first noticed that both of the metal tops had multiple dents in the tops. The pepper also had a very fine hairline crack, that eventually led to a failure with the entire caninster splitting open. These items were the perfect color and what I was looking for. What they were not was a reliable and functionable product."
5,Salt & Pepper shakers,I purchased these shakers as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. They were just what I was looking for and my daugter loved them. They are a true red and I love it that the tops are stainless steel.
1,Large Black Pepper/Salt Shakers,"I just received my set on Wednesday, November the 2nd and let me tell you, they are the worse set I've ever purchased, the top on the salt shaker does not fit properly, it just turns and turns but does not lock so when I put the salt in and tried to shake it, wow everything just fell out of the shaker. I am so sorry I purhcased this set. Unfortunately, when I received the package, I immediately threw away the box so I cannot send them back b/c I do not have a small box to send them back to Amazon/sender. It's my lost, so I will eventually throw them away because I cannot use them at all. What a waste of my money! I would not recommend this set to anyone!"
2,Loved Them...at first,"I was extremely happy with the beautiful red color and the large size...which is great for cooking. One of the reasons I purchased these was the top...I'm so tired of filling shakers from the bottom while salt and pepper pour out the holes. However, the inside of the salt top rusted horribly after just a couple months. I have since scrubbed them and poked thru all the holes, had them rust up again, scrubbed them/poked thru all the holes, had them rust up again...you get the idea. The pepper shaker has less of a rust problem, but it still rusts inside also. I love the look of them and if the tops didn't rust (or if I could figure out a way to stop them from rusting) I'd give them 5 stars! I'm currently shopping Amazon for new S&P shakers that don't have any metal...I'll have to fill from the bottom, but I've discovered that's a lesser pain in my butt than the rusted tops."
2,Not what was expected,"These salt and pepper shakers are very large - about the size of a can of pop. Certainly much larger that I have a use for. And with the size of the holes for the salt and pepper to come through, it is easy to apply to much of either to your food. Other reviewers mentioned a problem with the lids falling off. I didn't have this issue."
5,Just Great,I had been looking for a long time for very large shakers to use when I am cooking and these are perfect. Also I needed red accents to match my decor. Very Happy!
2,Way to big,"Comically large. I believe these should be used as a set prop for the stage version of The Incredible Shrinking Woman. I don't know any family, with exception of the Duggars that would use this much salt and pepper in a lifetime."
2,Salt & pepper shakers,"Pretty, but lids don't screw on properly, ""leaking"" salt/pepper around the rims. Afraid they're going to fall off dumping all contents into food."
4,These are HUGE!,"I love everything but the size. These things are huge! You have to be very careful when shaking because you will overdo it in an instant! Other than that, they are very well-made and very nice."
5,Oggi Salt and Pepper Shaker Set is the Best!,"This shaker set is exactly what I have been looking for! I wanted a big set to match the new French White dishes I just bought, They are easy to clean and are attractive on my kitchen table."
2,Pepper Lid Won't Lock In Place!!!,Cosmetically these are nice. However the pepper lid won't tighten which makes these useless to me and not worth the hassle of sending them back!
2,Poor quality control,"We bought the black ones because previously, we had bought a red set, and one of them was defective in that the top would fall off. Now we use one red one and one black one, So far 3 out of 4 are OK."
2,"stainless steel tops, not happening","first set i got showed up broken and the stainless steel lids looked dull not shiny. they quickly sent out a new set, not broken but the lids again were a horrible pewter looking color vs. the shiney stainless steel i was looking for. i have these exact shakers in cobalt blue and the lids are extremely shiney. Do not appreciate the change to the lids, they look like old crap, not brand new pieces. I will be shipping them back."
4,Good but an acquired taste,"I've had the ""I'm Healthy"" products before, but this time I tried to be a little more healthy and get the organic kind, which is basically ground up soy nuts with minimal sugar and sweetness. Not bad by any means, but definitely something that will take a few times to get used to. Its not nearly as sweet as usual soy nut butter, but those looking for more of a healthy alternative, which still serves the peanut type flavor, go for it and I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
3,"Good case, tough clip","The case is a good one -- good quality leather, fits the Treo well, stays put. However the clip is very strong. It won't fall off of your belt, but you will struggle to get it on. I do it by prying it open and putting a pen under it and then putting it on the belt, and slipping the pen out and then using a good deal of effort to seat it on the belt."
4,always lasted about 1 year,"before needing to be replaced, wore it on my hip always - 18 hours a day. Was a great holster for the time when Treo was the leading smart phone"
4,Palm case evaluation.,Everyting is great except the belt clip is too tight and takes a lot of effort to get it on the belt.
1,Very disapointing!,"What looked like a well made case when I purchased it just was not. The clip was just way to tight to put on or take off the belt. After 2 weeks the clip just ripped out of the side of the case while I was just taking it off. A total waste. Don""t buy it. If it wont hold up very long. The leather is very thin and not strong. Disappointing!!!"
3,Phone Case,"The case is really nice leather and it hold the phone securely. I really like it. Sometimes the leather on the belt hook folds towards the back of the case making it difficult to slide on to my belt. I have to make sure to fold the leather away from the case before trying to slip in on. If I don't, it won't go on. That's the only thing I don't like about it and that's why I give it three stars."
2,Too hard to quickly remove your Treo to answer a call,"Here's a nice looking Palm leather case, designed perfectly to fit the Treo 650/700 models. In fact, maybe it's designed too perfectly, as getting the phone out quickly to answer a call is somewhat difficult.Yeah, the other reviews are positive (and that's why I ordered this one), but I'm still looking for a case where my Treo can easily be removed from a protective holder."
4,"Nice, but had its flaws","This product is made of great quality leather, however, it has a few minor set backs such as: the flap opens too easily thus if you are running fast up stair, for instance, your palm may fly in the air. This happened to me, sadly. Also, it is difficult to place on your belt, but if it weren't, the, it wouldn't be as secure either.All in all, it is one of the best for the treo that I have seen so I recommend it."
5,Can't Get a better deal,Great Qualtiy at a great price. Has very nice fit for my phone. Little hard putting on belt but can live with that....Same as OEM but bettter price!!!
5,Awesome Clip,"I have had the clip for about 1 month now and I have to say it does exactly as advertised. It is the Palm OEM case. I have a treo 755p and it fits in there perfectly. As other people have noted, the clip is extremely stiff so clipping it onto your belt and removing it is pretty tough. I guess that is a good thing. The manetic flap works like a charm."
5,Returning Customer - Great product!,I am a returning customer to this vendor. The product was shipped and arrived to me early and it was a quality product ... They are total winners here on Amazon.
4,Palm Treo Case,"Nice looking, quality construction, soft leather. Only gripe, end/cross straps prevent inserting charger cable with Treo in case (as depicted in photos). Work-around is to place Treo into case with antenna in bottom of case. Otherwise, nice piece of gear."
3,Had it for a while now,I have had this case for a couple of years now. I agree with the other reviews I have read regarding it's superior durability and security. The one area for improvement is the belt clip. I have worn through two belts now with this product (something you should factor into the cost). If they came up with one that remained low profile and secure yet did not damage your belt I would buy it in an instant.
2,Could be Better,the case is decent but lacks the ability to not jack up your belt torning it up with everytime you clip it on.........
4,Palm leather holster,I used to have the leather one from Palm with the metal snap. Loved it but when the snap finally wore out after 4 years I needed to buy a replacement. I was disapointed to find that it was no longer available (at least I couldn't find it).Bought this one and couldn't be happier. LOVE the magnetic catch. Stays closed but flips open effortlessly. Pops shut all by itself.Not totally pumped about the white stiching though.
4,Watch out for water!,"I too liked the case. However, my clip fell off after I rode an amusement ride and got it slightly wet. Oops, I reattached it three times, first with glue, then with wire, then with glue and wire only to have it fall apart. I may buy it again--but be sure to keep it out of the rain!"
4,Good Product,"This Product was very good , i haven't faced any problems with it .The quality is good , easy to carry , but only difficult i faced with this is while hooking this to belt of my trousers , it is hard to hook and remove , once it was hooked thats it! tornados cant move it...."
4,Not bad,"The case is easy to use and hold securely to my belt or waistband. My phone is easy to put in and get out when I want it out, but remains secure when I don't need it.The only problem I had is with the belt clip. It came to me with a fine leather covering over the belt clip. The belt clip is very tight, and the second time I put it on my belt, the leather covering it tore and came off. It really didn't affect the functioning at all, but I was annoyed that something I just purchased came apart on the second use."
5,Great case/holster for Treo 700p,"Love it. It hangs onto my belt nicely. The clip is firm and will last a long time. The leather wrapping on the clip might not though. The magnetic flap is just fine: It holds closed at any angle. Case is slick looking, black leather with beige thread. It looks pro. The small pocket for business cards is a plus. It is always nice to have an extra place to store them."
1,Palm pouch useless,"Pouch felt clumsy. There was extra play where the phone could wiggle around in. Also the clip is so thin that it's not good with sweatpants or scrubs. With the weight of the phone, it will flip over if it's not clipped onto a belt."
2,Delivery,"It took almost close to 3 weeks before I got the item, Amazon had the old address but I corrected it and sent an FYI to the seller and they acknowledge it but did not get to my present address till after like what I have mentioned close to three weeks."
3,"The songs are great, but the performances are lacking","It is quite possible that I am in the minority when I say this, but I much prefer a deep, choral sound when I listen to hymns. The performances here do not bring out an efficient, organized sound. The choice of songs on this disc is wonderful, but I would go for something different."
5,Beautiful Collection,"If you're looking for a contemporary accompaniment to classic hymns, then this is the collection for you. Beautiful orchestration uplifts a small, but good, ensemble. Look for the split track version if you'd like a great hymn soundtrack collection for church or solos."
5,A Book to Remember,"This awe-inspiring book reminds us of a war that some of us may have forgotten and other would like to. The words that Dr. Holley uses to describe his fears,concerns, and disgust with the war is a chilling reminder to us all. Dr. Holley tells his story in 1968-69 real-time by incorporating letters to his sweetheart and his parents. The book begins with Dr. Holley receiving that wonderful letter from Uncle Sam stating that his medical services are needed so that his country maybe served, through his one year tour-of-duty including his experiences with Col. Hackworth. You will hear this story from a man, a true man, who has saved countless lives and lives to tell about it. Dr. Holley captures his audience in this must-read for any person that survived his or her nightmares. This is simply a must-read."
3,Poor Baby MD,"I'm a Vietnam Veteran. The book would be much better if the good doctor didnt whine so much. He's whines about everything. And when he isnt whining he's kissing David Hackworth's butt. I mean, I wanted to cry when the poor-baby doctor was compelled by the evil army to treat grunts rather than continue his medical education in a rear-area hospital. And when Doc Poor-Baby finally became a REMF, he whined about that, too.Poor-Baby, MD whines about the endless hours of work yet has the time to write long, detailed letters to his girl-friend every day. This makes me suspicious of his veracity.Officers of every stripe had lives of comparative ease and comfort in Vietnam. And they pulled 6 months in combat zones, not 12 like the grunts."
2,broken grinder 3 weeks after purchase,if you intend on using a osborn log brush buy two grinders if you are going to brush whole house. I am like 90% done and my grinder just smoked and stopped working. WTF now i gotta send it in to makita. looks like i need to waste more money on another one and get overnight shipping to get it here.
5,Excellent product! I don't usually like gel because ...,"Excellent product! I don't usually like gel because it appears sticky and unnatural in my hair, but this product really changed my mind. It's a very light hold, but enough to style your hair. Works especially well with a hair dryer for added volume and style."
4,I have used gels on my hair before ...,"I have used gels on my hair before and this one is better than average. It didn't say on the tube exactly how much to use, but I found out less is better because it weighs your hair down. My hair is naturally curly and I did like the results."
4,"I have long, curly hair and have always ...","I have long, curly hair and have always preferred mousse over gel. This seemed to hold much better than other gels and didn't leave my hair feeling """"crunchy""""."
2,"Useful summary, poor exposition","The author's staccato writing style is reminiscent of Gilbert Strang's. Some may like it, but I find it jarring. The content is a concise summary of interesting topics at the confluence of mathematics, logic and computer science (see the table of contents), but it reads like a précis for those who already know the subject. This is no doubt fine if you fall into that category. If you're looking for an expository text, this, alas, isn't it."
1,Wretched Transfer,"The video quality is soooo bad, and my hopes to see good footage of Marcel Marceau on DVD were high. Alas!"
4,Astrology students need this book,"How this book ever got out of print for a minute I do not know. All students of astrology need Demetra in their bookshelf and on their desk. An understanding of the asteroid goddesses is a way to add an entire new dimension to understanding the natal and other charts. Demetra understands the ladies in myth, history, and in the psyche, and she details, amazingly well, their meaning in the chart.5 stars except that I wish the other asteroids were included ... The four main goddesses are here and understanding them is enough of a project for awhile ... but I wish we'd gotten the entire sisterhood ... probably they are around here somewhere ...The great thing Demetra has done is add the presence of feminine values and concerns to the horoscope. Supporting the Moon, the asteroid goddesses have as their interest, relationship, hearth, romance, adventure, protection, nurture. No natal chart should be without them."
5,Nice!,"This arrived before the expected date for xmas, but although I always wear a large, was a little snug. So I sent it back and got a full refund. However, the large pants fit perfectly, and I have worn them all winter."
4,Egg Money Quilts:1930 Vintage Samplers,This is a great book if you like old fashioned quilting. Templates are included with easy instruction and great pictures.
5,Love to quilt,Great book with easy to follow directions. If I choose to I can use my fabric stash for these patterns....or not.
4,Mother-In-Law Is Pleased,"I purchased this book for my mother-in-law who had seen it on TV. She was excited to get it. She didn't feel it contained as much information as they implied on the television show she had seen, but nonetheless, she was pleased."
5,Egg Money Quilts,I love the quilts and the simple direction. but most of all I love the stories she tell about the quilts.
5,One of Eleanor Burn's best books,"Egg Money Quilts is one of the best quilting books that Eleanor Burns has published. Excellent quilt patterns, directions and templates. Even a novice could get a lot out of this book."
4,Eggscellant book,"Delightful book, the author is well known in the quilting world. She has included clear instructions for quilts, with personal history of the Depression era.For a quilter a tempting stash visiting book, I read and immediately started pulling out fabric!!"
4,Great book,"This is a really good book. Didn't stay together very good though. Not well made at all. It is a must have for quilters, since she has some great shortcuts."
1,Brutal...enough said,I can't believe the reviews this set has received. It sounds terrible and cuts a bunch of tracks out of the catalog. If you're a real Sabbath fan avoid at all costs. Get the 2009 Deluxe and Remastered versions or the 1996 Castle Communications versions.
5,Truly the Greatest,This is the quintessetial collection of classic Sabbath - Put these disks in and hit random shuffle - you can't get a bad track - Mandatory Mechandise for any true Ozzy fan
4,Really Nice Shoe!,"I ordered these shoes without ever trying an Allen Edmonds shoe before. I liked that they were made in the U.S. and that they still followed traditional shoe making techniques. I have a few pairs of nice, expensive shoes, Gucci and Cole Haan to name a few. And these shoes are right up there with them and may out class them a little. They look and feel very solid. Like you could walk through the jungle, but they are extremely soft and comfortable. I am a size 10 D and I found their sizing to be spot on. I will definitely be buying Allen Edmonds shoes again. I'm sold!"
4,Intelligent Writing,"Neutral War is an undetached, unsympathtic, in your face story of the relationship between two men of differing cultures in the years before and during World War II. While I found the pace rather slow and the author seemed entrenched in conveying every fact he discovered it still didn't dispell the honesty, and truth which drips from every word.While I would have sincerly liked to have read more of the (fictional??) relationship between the Swedish narrator and Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto since this clash of cultures was intelligent and at times humorous, Gold seems bent on pressing us with facts, facts, and more facts.Is there something wrong with this...not in my book. It was an inspiring and candid look at the protocol of war. It practically proves the adage 'those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it.'Neutral War is 'very' much a book for OUR times and should not be overlooked for thinner, fluffier, more cozy reads."
5,"Pricey, but a few drops are all that's needed per use","A few drops in one's hair is all that's needed to calm dry fly-away hair and add shine.Faipa's Liquid Crystals is a very good leave-in conditioner. At first glance the product seems expensive, but only a few drops are applied after shampooing. The bottle I have now will easily last a month's worth of shamoos and the conditioning effect means I can get by without hair sray or gel on those laid back/casual days.Faipa Sicura Professional Post Color Shampoo, 300 ml"
2,Doesn't help much....,"I bought this for my wife to prevent strech marks from appearing. However, in the last month, those marks came on. I've seen in other reviews that people say you just can't prevent strech marks by applying such cream on you belly if you have the gene, though I'm not quite sure about this."
4,unexpected,"I have been using this drill to mix thinset mortar for the past 4 months. I have no complaints. I burned out my 6 year old Dewalt drill one morning and this drill was the only thing available for immediate use. I'm glad it was. I had initial sticker shock when i heard the price, but this drill is far superior to my last.A metal housing? are you serious? i thought they stopped making tools this well. The 12"" grab bar is a nice feature because this drill packs a tremendous amount of torque. It makes mixing a thick bucket of cement easier.This is an excellent tool for the professional who needs this kind of power day in and day out. I would say it is a little it overkill for the DIY crowd or a once in a while user.i reserve the last star for durability. So far so good."
2,yuck,I think this guy has some good scents and soap ideas but some of his formulas are pretty bad. I just made his #4 one with the high amount of beeswax. It showed me how little he knows about soap. The result was an awfully sticky waxy soap. Yuck. He's pretty off on his lye calculations for a few of the recipes too.
2,Beautiful photos/Safety Concerns,"I have been operating a soap making business for 2 years and never tire of the process. Visually, I thought the book was beautiful; however, it's not one I'd recommend to beginners who really need to understand the process as well as a more thorough run-down of pitfalls and dangers. I am also very concerned with safety for the soap maker and the end-user. I thought that in reviewing the recipes, some of them seemed lye excessive. Also, excessive in the amounts of pure essential oils he recommends per each batch. They may smell wonderful but many of us know the potential dangers of irritation and sensitization. Experienced soap makers could play with his recipes and make proper adjustments for safety and quality; however, a beginner won't know any better. I recommend choosing another book such as the Natural Soap Book and of Soap Makers Companion by Miller-Cavitch for starters."
2,Dangerous typo,"This book has a potentially dangerous typo! The recipe on page 101 calls for 15.9 ounces of lye when it should be 5.9. This much lye will overheat, probably boil over, and could possibly explode. It's something an experienced soap maker would never do, but a beginner could get hurt.Other than that I really like the book. It has good basic cold-process recipes and interesting rebatching ideas. I have it from the library, and plan to buy it."
4,Going Deeper with the Holy Spirit,"would recommend.good teaching about Holly Spirit, and how to really get deeper in relationship with him."
5,This is the REAL DEAL!!,"Elvis absolutely adored each and every one of these Gospel Quartets! These are the cream of the crop of Gospel singers! Trust me, it does Not get better than this.J D Sumner, Jake Hess,Rosie Rosell,James Blackwood, Ed Enoch!Elvis even hired most of these for his own records.If that doesn't tell you anything!!! This disc is a true history lesson of Southern Gospel and the influence on Rock and Roll!"
