1,Totally worthless as a kitchen scale,"This might be accurate to within a half-pound or so, but I wouldn't trust it further than that. I'm dumping it and getting a digital scale."
2,THIS IS INACCURATE!,Imagine my disappointment when I am trying to make quarter pound hamburgers to end up with three burgers out of one pound. It was more than a half a pound off. Stay away.
1,IT DID NOT LAST LONG,"I BOUGHT TWO SOEHNLE 11 POUND CULINA SCALE, ONE I GAVE IT HAS A GIFT. THE OTHER ONE I KEPT. WELL THE NEEDLE THAT GIVES YOU THE READING BROKE OFF. I DON`T THINK I HAD IT FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS. I THREW THE BOX AND PAPER AWAY. PLEASE TELL ME WHAT I SHOULD DO. UNHAPPY CUSTOMER. MODESTO CARUSO"
3,Not Really,"This was advertised as a first edition 1917, but in fact its a fourth edition 1945. The Scofield Reference Bible was first published in 1909, 1917, 1937, 1945. The condition was excellent."
2,Will not hold Purigen,Mesh is not fine. Purigen falls right out. The only product with fine enough mesh is Seachem's The Bag 180 micron mesh bag.
2,better off using nylons,"the holes are too big; will not hold purigen. fine for just carbon or large media. Weak, tears over time. i will not be purchasing again."
1,quality problem&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;,"Just only use about one and half month, when I was using it and the Dryer stopped working suddenly. it's some part of inside the dryer was broken I guess and I really want to return this item&#65281;I was very angry about the quality of this dryer!"
4,Good for the money,"I use this blow dryer at least 4x/week and so far so good. I have had it for about a month now. The only complaint I have is that the concetrator falls off really easily. Then, if I want to put it back on, I have to wait at least 5 minutes, because it is too hot to touch. So basically, I do half my hair with the concentrator on the blow dryer, and once it falls off (cause it always does) I just do the rest of my hair without it. Other than that, a good product for the money!"
3,Missing parts,"I had a similar dryer that lasted many years until I dropped it on the bathroom floor. It was a great dryer. I therefore ordered this model that looks a lot like my old one. Not only that, but it behaves like my old one. I love it. But. It was supposed to come with several accessories, a diffuser, a concentrator and an endcap. The endcap was not in the box and the other two accessories didn't fit (I think they needed the endcap). I didn't return the dryer because this wasn't a problem for me. I have very short hair and didn't need or want the accessories. But if you are counting on getting the whole enchillada --check the box as soon as it comes in."
1,Doesn't get hot,I had the same hair dryer a few years ago and it got hot. My new one didn't so I ended up throwing it away and getting a Revlon Turbo 1875. That one is great for thick hair like mine!
5,It makes my hair straight. I love it,It makes my hair straight. I love it. The smaller nozzel focuses the heat where i want it. Strong and powerful.
3,ok but heavey,ok but heaveynice does its job but looks small was supprized how heavey it was.has all the heat adjustmentas I was looking for
1,started a fire,"This hairdryer started a fire in my home 3 weeks ago. It was left plugged in but not left on. It did not overheat. I did notice that it hesitated to turn on for a half second before we used it for the last time. I set it down on a table and left for the day. When I returned a few hours later, it had melted into an unrecognizable puddle. Burned the table and the floor beneath it. The outlet was tripped but still intact, the fire dept said it was clearly a wiring issue within the hairdryer itself. Please make sure to unplug your hairdryers after use!!!!"
3,Not as powerful as the older Vidal Sassoon dryers were.,"I had an older model that looked just like this but was gray. It died and I wanted to replace it because this was the only dryer I had found that was powerful enough to dry my thick hair quickly. This new version is definitely not as powerful. It is ok, but not like the old one."
5,"so far, i like it!",We used to have a professional hair dryer but to heavy so i replaced it for this one and I'm very happy with it!
4,Good,"Good effective dryer for the price.Because of the way the dryer is built, the attachment pieces cannot be twisted to an angle I'm comfortable with."
5,Great Hair Dryer,"I had been using an awful 8 year old, non-ionized dryer until I purchased this one... and I cannot say enough good about this product. The temperature and output controls are fantastic; it was definitely worth the money."
4,Vidal,"I have a weakness for Vidal Sassoon but this blowdryer didn't blow my mind. lol. However, it's extremely light which makes it very easy to handle. I can't say it's too powerful either. Also, I thought the diffuser was going to be bigger, but it does its job pretty well as it is. I have a LOT of curly hair and if I use the Warm setting it takes a century to dry it, so I have to use the Hot setting. Thank god it doesn't burn my hair which is why I gave it 4 stars."
3,nice hair dryer,"I'm sure this is a good hair dryer for most people, but my hair is very fine and flyaway wispy, so I am personally unhappy with it . Even the low setting is way too high for my hair. If you have fine hair, I would recommend looking for a hair dryer with a high, medium and low. The medium setting seems to necessitate a lower low speed."
2,I don't usually write a review but...,"Had this item for a year now and it just broke on me, so I figured I needed to write a review to warn buyers. When the item first arrived, the back lid (air vent) didn't close all the way but it really didn't bother me much. I've had many other 1875w dryers and this one was a bit louder than my previous ones. About a week ago, the hair dryer stopped producing warm/hot air and now it just blows cold air. Had to throw it out and purchase a different hair dryer. This might just be a one time scenario... but I wouldn't purchase again."
3,Too Wrinkly,"The C-Line Self-Adhesive Business Card Holders are a decent quality product. The adhesive works well. However, I wish it wasn't too wrinkly. I could only use half of them for my high-end presentation."
3,Pretty but not very psych,"This is a fey 1960's pop band with much orchestration to their sound....a very light listen,as opposed to the ""psych"" classic the write-up promises.It's pleasant,...but not an amazing psych relic. More to the taste of flower pop fans,....like the lightest of Donovan songs(if you catch my drift,Sunshine Superman?)...ahem...."
1,weak work,"In my humble opinion, Black is not very serious history. If you want facts about ""Great Men"" it's fine. If you want explanation which stands up - look elsewhere. Black is the return of old fashioned ""lists of great men"" history. Just when you thought we'd moved on !"
2,Better than nothing,This is what it says it is. What it doesn't say is how flimsy it is. It'll do until I can find a quality replacement.
1,1 book is not a multimedia KIT! Ripped off.,"The advertising for this ""booklet"" was misleading. I felt sick when I opened the package & discovered it was the multimedia kit -booklet-without the 5 DVD's which the booklet refers to. Not to mention the photo image has x5 DVD's pictured in it. I'd like a refund & return the product... but don't know how to go about this.The product itself is excellent - when used with the 5 DVD's it makes reference to for the exercises. So instead of paying $10 less ($80 cost to buy & get it to me) I now will have to pay double the $90 for another complete kit.Shonky dealing."
1,Wearing IC70,This machine did not crush ice very well. It broke the third time using it. Very disappointed that I purchased it and wasted my money.
1,Think Of It As A Rental,"We bought one of these Waring IC70 ice crushers for around $90 from Amazon a few years ago and it lasted just a little over a year. After seeing all the 4 and five star reviews I thought perhaps ours was a rare defective one so we tried again. The same thing happened. So if you don't mind buying this product with the idea that you're basically renting it for $90 bucks per year, go ahead. The problem is that the stainless steel blades are mounted to a cam with plastic spacers keeping the blades apart. When one of these spacers go, the whole machine is kaput!! Until Waring puts a solid, one-piece stainless component in these machines they're not worth the bother. Oh, and don't go looking at one of the similarly price Deni products. They're made exactly the same way. The only differece is that the Deni we bought lasted slightly less than one year!"
3,Ice Crusher Review,The ice crusher worked very well for just over a year using itevery other day or so to crush 3 to 4 regular trays of ice cubes.After that time it failed because the nylon drive bar hadrounded off and could not push the ice breaking teeth thruthe ice cubes. I had to purchase a new unit and reduce theice cubes to half their size and hope the unit will last longer.
2,Died after first batch,"We loved the looks of the Waring Pro IC70 - but after hooking it up we only managed to crush a single glass of ice before it died.At first we thought it was just jammed (even though we only put in a single cube at a time). After cleaning it still didn't work. We ran hot water through everything, dried it and re-tried: no affect.Finally after allowing it to sit for 2 days (certainly no ice it in now) we noticed the motor was running - but the blades didn't spin.After reviewing on-line a bit - this is a fairly common problem with this model. Sadly - we returned it.If we find a reliable ice crusher - we'll get it - but so far the field looks barren."
1,Save your money......,"This is my 2nd unit. It shows signs of failure after a month. These things have 3 teeth on a shaft driven by the motor. The link between the motor and the teeth is a stack of nylon or plastic cams. Once the shaft spins under the middle tooth a few times, the middle tooth no longer chips ice, but hangs on the cube, trapping it. When this happens ice won't migrate to the remaining 2 teeth because the back side of the middle tooth holds the next cube away from the remaining teeth. The drive train should be sufficiently strong to stall the motor when the cube is not crushed. It isn't. My first one lasted about 6 months. This one maybe 2 months at the most. The fix would require a design improvement; specifically better material selection. When the stuck cube melts, it works again until a cube sticks again; a pint of ice if you are lucky"
1,Don't be mislead by other reviews!,"This machine does NOT produce small pieces of ice like most of the other reviews indicate. I admit that re-reading the description, Waring does NOT indicate the sizes of crushed ice - all the indications of this were in the reviews. This machine will NOT produce quarter inch or smaller chips of ice. See the uploaded image of ice chips to get an indication of what this unit REALLY delivers. Most pieces are 1 inch or larger, hardly qualifying as crushed ice. Some of my ice cubes (from my automatic ice maker with the refrigerator) go through the machine WITHOUT being crushed at all! This machine WILL DEFINITELY be returned."
4,A great little machine!,"My wife loves this machine! A new refrigerator replaced our old ridiculous side-by-side model, where the ice crusher was it's only good feature. It does a great job, quiet, doesn't jam, is well built, simple to use, and should last for years. It would be nice if it had adjustable settings, but for standard crushed ice it does a great job. Unfortunately, at 15-1/2"" high, it is 1/2"" too high to fit int the space between our upper wall cabinets and the base cabinets on our countertop, hence only 4 stars."
3,ice crusher,"Does a good job crushing small ice cubes. However, you can not use too large of cube, as it will jam in the throat of the ice crusher. Sometimes, the cubes are hard to remove when this happens. Using the smaller cubes, it works great."
4,Nice middle ground between ice cubes and slush,"I was looking for something that made crushed ice like I had in the hospital. This is close. It's nice to chew on compared to big ice cubes, and not slushy like what my smoothie maker makes. I thought I could send the crushed ice back through a second time to get the bigger pieces smaller, but that doesn't usually work. It's a nice middle ground between ice cubes and slush.Regarding other reviews about the ice getting stuck in the top, I don't use huge sized ice cubes to begin with and a little nudge and it's fine."
4,A nice little machine,"When I received the Waring, it appeared smaller than I envisioned, but that's OK, its a single switch operation ON/OFF, the ice chute as many others complained about does clog up, but only if you put too much ice in at once, if you feed the cubes in slowly you'll be OK, dumping a bunch of ice cubes in at once will for sure clog the chute, and I'm using very small size cubes with the hole in the center, Also the bigger the cubes the more trouble your going to have. Other than that its a great machine."
2,not satisfied,This product was beautiful to look at and that's about it. It crushes ice the same consistency as the ice crusher in my refridgerator. I expected a finer crushed ice like that is used in a bar.
3,Slow but Good and Silent,"I read the other reviews before I bought this ice crusher and I have little to add, Slow but Good and Silent just how silent was the big supprise. It is not silent but a very low level of sound. If you have a lot of Ice to crush I suggest getting two because I got the best results with one half-moon ice at a time and it would be easy to feed two at the same time. 2011-12-30 It did not last as long as I had hoped. HarOLD"
4,Waring IC70,"I purchased the Waring IC70 for the purpose of making sno cones. It went through many pounds of ice with no problem, but it didn't ""pulverize"" the ice. The chunks were too big to be enjoyed as son cones. Even putting the ice through a second time didn't help. Again, the machine worked extremely well without overheating."
5,Great ice crusher,"I purchased two of these ice crushers in July, 2009 --fantastic.My husband LOVES them - bought one for office and one for home.One just broke - my husband used it several times a day at his office --using tray cubesWe use ice maker cubes on the one at home and it is still working nicely.I am ordering another for the office - a well loved and well used product.ALWAYS receive fast, efficient service from Amazon!!!"
4,Ice crusher,"This product crushes ice fast, it is quiet in operation. The only drawback due to the size of the hopper regular ice cubes from tray are just a little too big for the chopping arms to grab the ice cube. I got around it by feeding in the cubes sharp edges first and have a 90+% success. The size of the crushed ice is varied from 1/8"" to 5/16"" which is great for drinks. Compared to the machine I had before this is a positive improvement."
3,works OK,It does the job. Don't expect mountains of ice shavings in seconds but it will make a hill of ice for Frozen Margarettas pretty quickly. Larger pieces tend to get stuck in the feeding shoot and that will stop the action. It works okay and I'll keep it.
4,ice crusher,"this machine really grinds the ice. if there is a flaw, larger cubes seem to get stuck and it takes a little prodding to get those larger cubes to start grinding. Smaller refrigerator cubes do fine and it crushes the ice great!!"
3,GREAT ... as long as it lasts.,"I bought this ice crusher exactly two years ago. It has been a great appliance in the kitchen, crushing five trays at a time of frozen distilled water, which we store in 1 gallon ziplock bags in the freezer.Today it died on us. It had been hinting the last few grinds that it was close to giving up the ghost. Today it did ... the grinding arms no longer have any torque to crush the ice cubes.I think this is a fantastic ice crusher. But I think two years is entirely too short a life for an appliance that costs as much as this one. Perhaps that is the way of things - you get a couple of years of good use, throw it away and get another. But that works out to almost $40 per year to crush our ice. Might not be that economical if I look into other alternatives.Still, I just ordered another one. Hope it lasts at least two years."
2,Poorly designed ice crusher.,"I have owned this ice crusher for over a year. I crush ice from my ice maker which makes those half moon shapes. I do this about once a week, crushing up one of those ice maker bins full. This ice maker gets plugged up all the time. It doesn't matter how you load it, it will just stop crushing and you can hear the ice working up and down. You can poke the cubes down with a long plastic spoon and get it crushing again, but sometimes this doesn't even work and you have to pour water through it. When I bought this machine I thought I could pour in the cubes and let the machine do the work. Think again. You have to baby this poorly designed machine along constantly. It's better than putting your cubes in a towel and beating them with a hammer, but not much."
5,FINALLY Ice Eating addicts Celebrate,"I totally agree with Amy Y. Seeing as I am also an Ice eater addict,I have been in search for the perfect ice machine. This baby is ""THE ONE"". Perfect sized for munchin on or mixed drinks ect...I have yet to get a large chunk that i have to bite in half to munch on..each one is perfectly sized. Keep in mind they are chunks..not shaved...If u want snowcone like ice go with the hawaiian shaved ice ice shavers..i have those as well..perfect snowcones lol. This is the one for ice eating addicts everywhere!!!!!"
1,Returned Product,"Returned the product. I don't think this should be called a ""Professional"" Ice Crusher. It crushes ice the same way my GE Profile refrigerator ice dispenser does. My blender crushes ice better than this product."
4,OWNED 3 SO FAR,I am now on my 3rd Waring Pro IC70 Professional Ice Crusher. My first two lasted about one year. It was used several times a day during the year so I don't mind buying a new one once a year. I have bought and tried several brands and find this product is the best one for what I want in an ice crusher.
5,Brilliant piece of Machinery,Very nice design and good qualityDid a research with similar products but this one stood out from the rest
3,Same as Refrigerater crushed ice,"Bought this machine thinking it would deliver a finely ground/consistant sized ice. The crushed ice is exactly the same size that my refrigerator already delivers. So, if you have a crushed ice dispenser in your refrigerator you don't need this item. If not, then it works great"
2,would not buy again,"I have purchased this and would not do so again. I bought this and it worked for 5 seconds before it froze. I exchanged it for another one (same model) and, although it worked for a year, we only used it a couple of times a month. It also froze. You cannot just fill the hopper on top and expect it to feed effortlessly. You have to feed it a few cubes at a time, plus the ice chunks are rather large."
4,Does exactly what I expected,"This is a nice addition to my home bar. While it is a little slow for an item entitled ""professional"", it seems to chop ice good enough for me. There are no settings or adjustments. Just dump in your ice and turn on the switch. Simple."
5,crushed,We had an old ice crusher but it failed. Got this and it works great. Just pour in the cubes through the funnel that come with it and out comes the crushed ice. Easy and fast.
2,Eight Months And Blooie!,"The Waring Ice Crusher certainly looks like a professional machine, it is big, shiney and expensive. It is also relatively quiet and does not leak. I would have rated it, at least, four stars seven months ago. However after, eight months of light use the grinding mechanism died with a tinkle and rattle even though the motor still turned. So much for longevity and, perhaps, quality. I can only hope it is a sample defect but it appears to be more a new Conair than an old Waring product."
5,amazing,"I LOVE this ice crusher. I have never had an ""ice on the door"" refridge, but LOVE to chew on ice. Have always had an ice crusher on the counter, but they are more like ""shaved"" ice, which is great, but not the same. They always jam, and the ice is shaved so it melts very quickly I read a review that said this is more like crushed ice so I figured what the heck, i can't justify buying a new fridge just so I can have crushed ice!! I set it up the minute it came, and have been thrilled with it. THRILLED. I almost want to buy another one just in case this one breaks I will have a spare! Can't say enough greath things about this machine! I wish it was a quarter of an inch shorter, so it would slide under my cabinet and I could just pull it out to use it, but who cares! I finally have crushed ice in a moments notice! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE it!"
5,Waring ice crusher,"Very nice piece of equipment. We use it EVERY day and have had no problems whatsoever. Crushes ice to the size that we prefer. I had read other reviews that spoke of the crusher plugging up. We ALWAYS start the crusher BEFORE putting in the ice cubes,and it has performed well each and every time. We would recommend it to anyone."
5,Waring Ice Crusher Does The Job - Well,"We purchased the Waring IC70 Pro Ice Crusher a few months ago and have been very satisfied with it.Because we drink a lot of bottled water, our primary need for an ice crusher is to reduce cube ice into smaller pieces that can be put into plastic water bottles. The Waring does a great job at this.The only draw-back to this machine is when it becomes loaded with cubes which are frozen together - then the ice can become stuck in the shute and never reaches the grinder. If this ice jam can't be reached (once the machine is turned off) then the only solution is to let it sit until the ice jam melts enough to fall through the loading shute.Otherwise, it works perfectly and is definitely worth the price."
2,Limited usefulness,"This product does not live up to its claims. It arrived at my home with a prominent dent in the front panel. Despite the damage, it did work, but not for every use that it is intended. It crushes ice sufficiently to be used in the bottoms of serving trays to keep food items cold, but does not even come close to crushing ice small enough to be used in frozen drinks."
2,"Okay, I'm not..","I'm not rating this low because it's Pokemon.. I enjoy pokemon game even though I am 14. This game is pretty bad just because of the fact its so unbelievably repetative. It can get boring while you are just in for first race.. Now i'm not going to be like the other reviewers and buy a PSP and save money, ebcause realistically, you wouldn't be saving you're money buying a PSP. they are 250 bucks. I would simply reccomend you waiting for the DS to come out with better games. I know nintendo can do better, and I hope they will.. i spent 200 birthday bucks on you.. You will be better off waiting though for some new DS games than rushing out for a PSP, because they have no really good games at all on the line. Saps are just buying that thing because of the graphics.. dont be fooled.. nintendo has some tricks up their sleevesits just that this game wasn't one of them.. hopefully.."
1,"Dont Buy It, Or Else!!!","This game is a waste of money! You can only be Pikachu for everything, even in multiplayer! Theres a lot of different computer characters like charmander and meowth, but you can only be Pikachu! The levels you can make from pokemon from other pokemon games are boring. Theres only two checkpoints altogether! You cant attack other players with special moves, not even punching or kicking! You can only race from checkpoint to checkpoint! Plus, the computer characters know what items to get before a checkpoint and they know exactly where the checkpoints are! I read a review about this game before. The person said it was a bad game, but I bought it anyway. Now I know that I shouldn't of bought it. If you buy this game, that's $30 down the drain. Rent this game instead! Trust me!"
2,>< stupid ds!,"ok i admit the game is fun, but why couldn't they make it for GAMEBOY ADVANCE's!?!?! i mean, the games for nintendo ds are about $30 freakin bucks!!!! i hate the nintendo ds! but the game is fun...."
1,not worth buying,"i haven't played a lot of pokemon games, but out of the ones i have, this is probably the worst. first of all, the fact that you can only play as pikachu gets a little old. most racing games have an abundance of characters to choose from. mix it up a little. second, making pikachu run is not fun at all. instead of using the d-pad, you're forced to use the stylus. and that's fine, aside from the fact that you're literally scraping the stylus over and over and over across the screen and you have to keep doing it till the race is over (or you're in the hot air balloon...which i still don't understand). i bought this used at gamestop and had to return it. if you like pokemon games, skip this one."
1,very bad game,this is a very bad game. i bought it and got bored within a half hour.i traded it in the next day. the controls are very annoying and frustrating.i wouldnt reccommend this game to any one. a new ds game that i would reccommend s yoshi touch and go
1,"...I DON'T choose you, Pikachu!","Okay, I am a huge pokemon fan, but this is NOT a good game to get. For one thing, it scratches up your DS touch screen VERY badly to play it, because you have to move the stylus in a repetitive back-and-forth way...And those of you who wanted a cute little game similar to the other pokemon games? It's just a racing game. Go for Mario Kart DS, not this..."
1,a descrace to all pokemon games,i dont have DC but i play it at my friends house.he has pokemom dash. im not abig pokemon fan but this game sucks. u should save your money and buy a psp instead
3,Not if your looking for durability!,I love the pouch mainly because it protects the matching phone but it doesnt hold up well to everyday use. So if you want the style but need the protection I would stock up on them. Its a tad disapointing because it suppost to high quality. but what can ya do.
3,Beautiful But Not Practical,"I love the look and feel of this phone sleeve but it really should have a clip on the back of it. Although I love how this one looks, I usually end up using a cheap black one because it has a clip."
2,uuuuhhhh,"Ha, well was excied to get the holder. It serves it's purpose. The letter DG look great, and look very classy. The only thing i did NOT like with it, is that it feels cheap. The gold leathery casing that holds the phone is thin, and gets damaged way too easy. it is not durable, and resembles thin gold foil over harder cardboard. there is also a sewing seam that runs down the middle of the front, and back, that looks noticeable and adds to the cheapness look. i would NOT waste the money for the quality!!!"
4,Perfect for the fashionista...,"This Dolce & Gabbana cell phone case is a fantastic fashion accessory for your phone. It's slim, but most importantly it's cute. But if you're really looking for a case that's practical, thenthis probably isn't for you. But at this new low price, you can buy this AND a practical cell case!"
3,Beautiful case - NO CLIP,"The ad says no clip; I overlooked it when shopping for my wife.The case is beautiful and compliments the cellular telephone. Since a purse is not always practical for her, a belt clip option would have made this the perfect case and it would have lasted more than 3 days. As it is, the case was left on a table without the telephone inside and dog ate everything but the initials. He apparently liked it without the clip. the most expensive rawhide I ever purchased."
1,DG Case,I was expecting a little more for the price. Also the main reason I needed a case is to carry my phone on my belt. However cannot do that with this case.
2,Cold Porridge,"The choral singing is crude and sloppy throughout this album. The whole product has the sound and look (is that an alien on the cover?) of something hastily and cheaply produced. Indeed, opportunism seems to have ruled over musicianship, as it appears the product was rushed to market to coincide with the outbreak of war in Iraq. Grant Llewellan is a fine musician and capable of producing so much more. What went wrong? Are the musicians in Boston just not up to snuff, or is the board and administration just painfully parochial? This is an ensemble that became leaders in baroque music under Christopher Hogwood. So what makes them think they should be performing Schoenberg, Barber, Delius and Gorecki?"
5,Haunting stories fron The Otherside,"Every Happy's Album is worth owning. She has unique talent to capture listener in her dark words. Her voice is so powerful, and sensitive, you cry over her sadness, feel her pain and understand her deepest thoughts. Discover this gem in the big mess of today's manufactured pop music."
3,Schoolbook,"This is not a very difficult book, which is both a good and a bad thing. Most people probably use this as a part of their class, and it is not too difficult to be used in self-study. Some grammar is introduced in a weird order - some very common (and not difficult) structures are introduced quite late. I liked ""Shin Bunka Shokyuu Nihongo"" a lot more, but wouldn't recommend it for self-study.The kanji-reference in the end does not (if i remember correctly) include kanji learned in japanese for busy people 1 & 2, which IMO is a problem.(correction: it seems they are included, i remembered wrong.)Even if it has its problems it's not too bad. Would recommend it for self-study, if it fits your level (past JLPT4, maybe studying for JLPT3)."
3,Not as pictured,"This was a Christmas present for my son and we didn't notice until it was already opened that it was not what I had ordered. The set did come with Annie and Clarabel but they were die cast metal instead of the wood. At first I thought it wouldn't be a problem but when we returned home from our Christmas vacation my son found that the wheels were not spaced wide enough apart and were not big enough to work on the grooves of his wooden tracks. Plus, the magnets on these cars are not oriented properly to attach correctly to his wooden Thomas.Unfortunately the time has passed for me to return these. But if you do order them and want the cars to fit with your wooden railway I would confirm with the seller beforehand so you are not disappointed."
3,Wood Annie and Clarabel,"Yes the faces are the same. My son (3) has not noticed and it doesn't impact the fun he has with his trains. As for the label on the bottom of the train, it is made by TOMY. TOMY bought out Learning Curve a while back and from what I can tell they have comparable quality, better on some trains worse on others, the wheels on these trains are a little weird like they are worn or where cast in an old mold. It does not affect the functionality of the trains though my son did notice that and asked me why they had a booboo on the wheels. The face error mostly just disappointed me because I am an avid review reader and like to avoid defects when I can. That is why I am giving this three stars, I would give it two stars but you can't find these anywhere else even Toys'r'us, so if you want these outside of an expensive set jump on it. I would buy again knowing all of this."
5,great,"I think with each new Thomas movie, my son finds a new favorite train. Annie & Clarabel were his most recent have-to-haves. We're very happy with them."
5,Fun Thomas friends,"We got this for our 3-year-old for Christmas, he loves talking about Annie and Clarabel. Sturdy and compatible with his wooden railway."
3,Not very exciting for my 3 year old.,"My 3 year old got a train table and a few starter trains at a garage sale. Annie and Clarabel were part of the lot. He plays with them, and he knows they go with Thomas, but we have invested a lot of money on several trains and these get pushed aside as they are not so exciting for him. He gives them to his younger brother to play with. As a collector I am happy we have them though."
4,A must have for the Thomas collection!!,It's Annie and Clarabel..what more needs to be said! Every Thomas lover has to have them! My Grandson was thrilled to receive them!
2,Seemed like a decent chap at the time,"But it is hard to take Barnes' outrage about the fatwa against his friend Salman Rushdie seriously when you know the dreadful leftwing bilge he spouted about George Bush and Tony Blair before the liberation of Iraq (""not worth a single child's finger,"" he said, conveniently ignoring that children and their fingers were always in considerably more danger from the regime than from bombs). Barnes is another dedicated follower of political fashion who can express solidarity with another trendy writer of his class, but can't conjure up sympathy for ordinary Iraqis if it would mean, oh horrors, letting brute America use its military to save them."
5,Love the pan,"I had been wanting to make popovers for quite a time but didn't know how or where to start. I saw that I could buy the pan and get the recipe from Amazon. The first batch turned out very well. Something that I thought would be very complicated to make turned out to be very easy. And I am not a baker, just like muffins and popovers. My husband and I will enjoy having them a lot more now.Celina Nelke"
4,a fine album it is,"Music by a band ahead of it's time. Tony Mansfield (singer, composer, producer) has the ability of constructing a warm sound out of all the electronic instruments. Although you don't hear a guitarist and drummer on this album, it still has a great deal of emotion.The second album Anywhere, is already released. I am however waiting on ther third CD-release, Warp."
4,An Informative Overview,"I used this book in addition to the Confirmation classes I took at our Cathedral. It gave me the opportunity to study more in-depth the history and doctrines of the denomination I was becoming a part of. The book is clear, and laid out well for reference purposes. Recommended for anyone seeking to learn more about the Episcopal Church."
4,An Easy Read,This book is an easy read - one to two hours max. Huge print! However basic info on Episcopalian doctrine/ belief. Just as the title suggests.
5,A CLASSIC,"THIS IS MUST READING FOR EVERY SERIOUS EPISCOPALIAN. I THINK IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED FOR CONFIRMATION. IT IS SO REFRESHING TO READ SOMETHING RELIGIOUS BY SOMEONE WHO IS TERRIBLY WELL EDUCATED. SO DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE RUBBISH YOU SEE UNDER THE GUISE OF ""RELIGION"" NOWADAYS."
4,"Good, but pricey","I like how it's simple, clean, and easy to use. But it's way too expensive for a basic calendar software."
4,Excellent Departure from Bubblegum,"Relying on her good friend from the Go-Go's Charlotte Caffey, as well as members of Redd Kross (Mike McDonald, Charlotte's husband) and former Germs' bandmate Pat Smear, this is Belinda's most adventurous and musically mature album. Too bad her label couldn't give it the support it deserved."
3,Takes a while to get used to,"I got this mainly because I liked ""Big Scary Animal"". When I got this for Christmas '98, I enjoyed hearing the whole song(as opposed to the 30 second clip)as well as ""Goodbye Day"" ""Lay Down Your Arms"" and ""Tell Me"". But the reason for the three stars was because it was a little different than her other stuff and takes a while to know all the words so you can sing along(I like CDs where most or all the songs are easy to sing along to). It'll take a little time and more listens before I would give it a higher rating."
3,"Well, it's better than our old $5 tag-sale waffle iron.","We've used our new iron 4-5 times. There are three things we don't like. (1) can't remove the plates to wash them, and can't immerse the iron. In other words, cleaning it is a major pain. (2) the light is nice for knowing when the iron is hot enough, but I thought it would also indicate when waffles are done. It does not - you have to watch the steam and check, like with any other iron. (3) the waffles are not cooked evenly on both sides. When one side is done, the other is about 90% done.But, as the title says, we like it better than our old one. I just expected more for the money and from the Toastmaster name. It's so hard to find an iron that is not for Belgian waffles."
2,Dead Dead Dead,"Nothing is worse than pulling out your waffle iron for your customary Sunday waffles and the iron will not work. Barely a year old, it is already not working. Where is the quality of the old days when products were made to last and serve. It is sad when you buy an old and respected company product such as Toastmaster and be so sadly disappointed."
2,Wuthering Heights & Jane Eyre,"I have recently purchased and listened to both books, which are great stories and classic literature. The narrators were also great, making the stories come alive. I am upset, however, because this product is advertised as UNABRIGED, even though it is ABRIGED. There are only 2 cassettes per story for a total of 4 cassettes. If you're looking for an abriged version of these stories, this is a great purchase."
5,"Works as advertised, even through brand changes","Some web searching for a simple way to convert my manual valve to automatic led me here. Even if my old valve was a ""Lawn Genie"" and the new name is Toro the part number is the same.Follow the directions. Turn off water supply, unscrew the manual valve part, install automatic valve, turn on water, attach to controller and twiddle the adjustments to get the desired flow.I'm not someone that likes working on plumbing and this was outside of my normal comfort zone. Very happy when it all worked like it should."
3,"Interesting, but disappointing","I originally heard this group on a Garrison Keillor Prarie Home Companion radio broadcast soon after the tragic events in New Orleans last August. I enjoyed the music immensely and sought out recordings for my own benefit as a Christian and to indirectly help support our stricken brethren. I'm still glad I did, but the CD was not as satisfying as I had envisioned. While listening to this recording I soon realized that this group is highly improptu and serrendipitous and probably a real challenge to record. With all due respect, the majority of the music on this CD is very brash. One particular vocal piece is over sung and difficult to appreciate. Probably this is all due to a deficiency in my perspective, I'm sorry. The result is that I share this CD, which is good, but don't care if I get it back, which is bad. So, be careful."
1,Teflon blistered on first usage,"the first time that I used this product, I was cooking breakfast sausage at 300 degrees and the teflon coating blistered off on about 1/3rd of the pan. very poor quality."
3,TOASTMASTER LITTLE SKILLET,WAS LOOKING FOR A ROUND BRUNCH PAN AS SHOWN IN THE PICTURE BUT GOT A SQUARE LITTLE SKILLET- MAXIUM WAS THE NAME OF THE ROUND BRUNCH PAN THAT I RECEIVED FROM AVON PRODUCTS 25/35 YEARS AGO
3,Not for a laptop.,"It will not work on my laptop at all, but it will download on my table top computer. I do like the dictionary too."
2,Too Preachy,"Duncan's style is a little too cynical and preachy for my taste. As a reader, I didn't feel like there was any chance for reciprocity; to accept or reject his way of thinking. As such, he lost me. In my opinion, better enviromental/fly fishing writing can be found in the work of McGuane, David Quammen, and anthologies such as ""Wild 'bows & Crippled Duns."""
1,Low quality dribble,"After reading a gift copy of The River Why I found a first edition hardbound copy for my library. I will read it many times, and I will give copies to friends. I couldn't have been more diappointed in reading this random collection of essays. I guess I should have been warned by the long sub-title, but I don't understand how this collection, which is largely rants and complaints, made it to print. Being personally committed to and heavily involved in water and fishery conservation issues in California, a state which like Montana has huge problems, I share much of Duncan's frustration. In spite of probably being in sync with him on many issues, I found his writing to be unnecessarily strident and preachy. Overall, I found these essays to lack the humor and sparkling prose of his first book. I also purchased The Brothers K and promise to give it the aerial burial if it doesn't, from the very beginning, remind me of Duncan's wonderful first book."
2,Self-indulgent nonsense,"Duncan is a masterful wordsmith; this no one can reasonably dispute. But over the years, he has become so full of himself, so pretentious and self-important, that to me he is almost unreadable.I give the book two stars because of a little bit of excellent fly fishing content, and because of Duncan's undeniable writing ability. But before you buy it, you should read Donald Miller's hilarious send-up of Duncan (whom he labels Trendy Writer) in ""Blue Like Jazz."" Don Miller -- now there's a guy who has something significant to say on metaphysical themes. Duncan is merely showing off; Khwaja Khadir indeed!"
2,A rant by any other name,I found much too much rant in the first 2/3 of the book and would have put it down except we agreed to read it for a book group. Unless you are a really ardent environmentalist willing to lay your life down pass this up for something more balanced and sensible.
1,"Stereotypical, obvious, pompus","Duncan's textbook rants are so predictable I found myself mouthing the next sentence before I read it. As someone who's work and life is submerged in environmental, water use, and preservation issues I find this type of stereotypical ranting more detrimental to the issues that concern me than most G.W. policies. Duncan preaches to the choir, but his preaching is so over the top it is a turn-off. While I agree with virtually every theme and policy he promotes, his pompus diatribes push me in the other direction. If this book were written 40 years ago it might strike a radical tone and inspire action. In these times it is merely a rehash of the new-age mumbo-jumbo that is so easy for the opposition to tear down.This book will apeal to two audiences: new-age sheep, and right-wingers looking to bash environmentalists. The rest will find it harder to wade through than Columbia."
1,Worse Product Ever - Don't Buy,"Where to begin?1. This is an 11 CD product, which are independent programs, writen by 11 different companies, that do not interact with each other. Hello TOPICS its 2007, quit acting like it is 1997.2. Four of the programs will not run. Why? because it wants you to have shock wave 8.5 installed on your computer. I have Shockwave 10.1 installed. The program does not care that you have a newer verison. That is stupid.3. I sent an e-mail to these four companies to get a patch four the shockwave 8.5 requirement, its been 3 weeks now and no response.4. The products are about useless, my teen won't even look at them, he said the on-line web sites he found are much easier to use and they are free.5. I can't return the product, because I opened the product to use. The store didn't care if I was not satisified, they have a store policy on software product returns."
1,"Caution, Does Not Ship By Amazon","I really need to warn Amazon buyers about this product, because I ordered it twice and the wrong game showed up. I recieved the first of the series CSI one. The PC game series is one of the best of detective-TV style type game. A lot of fun. There is a all in one package if anyone is interested."
5,good read got the book in time,I got the book in time when I needed it for school and read in less than a morning.
5,Wonderful,Absolutely wonderful play. Certainly wish more of his works would have survived. A bit angry with myself for not having read this sooner.
3,"""Not tonight, dear""","A novel idea: in order to persuade their men to abandon their warrior ways, the ladies go on a ""sex strike."". Does it work? Men will do ANYTHING for a little ""nookie."". Just goes to show you; men haven't changed much since the days of ancient history. And they NEVER will!"
3,Lysistrata on Kindle,"The story:The story was ok. Difficult to understand because of the differences between our modern American culture and the ancient Greek's. Comical and light hearted. Gives good insight into the lives of women during the time period. Wouldn't read it again for pleasure, though.This edition for the Kindle:Great. No problems with it at all. Translation seems fine. Plus the price is good. If you need to read this story, don't be afraid to download this edition to do it."
1,Defective DVD,"The series is an excellent drama. The main complaint is that the DVD quality is poor. This is the second time that I bought the set of DVDs and more than one of the DVDs is defective. We tried cleaning it, using another DVD, etc, and the video would continue to pause or skip in the middle of play. It is very frustrating that even buying this series the second time would still have defects. Something needs to be reported to the company that manufactures these DVDs."
5,best korean series,This is the best Korean TV series. there are better prices&#65292;please make sure to shop around before you buy it.
4,"A thoughtful, rational guide","This is a good book for any college student who may be or even feel underprepared for college. The author stresses accountability rather than gimmicks or shortcuts. It should have had a better proofreading for minor gaffes in spelling, etc., but if you can ignore those, it's a nice guide."
3,book club in Connecticut,"We enjoyed reading this book. However, we thought it was a bitconfusing in the beginning. We recommend that you read the Indian inthe Cuboard before reading The Key to the Indian. END"
4,reading time,good reading for grandson. Wanted the set to keep for his future family after he would read them. Found the set but this book had to be ordered to complete the set
4,The Key To The Indian,"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was hard to understand at sometimes, if you had not read The Indian In The Cupboard. The adventure that Omri and his father go on is very exciting and suspenseful. If you liked reading The Indian In The Cupboard or any other of the sequels to this to this book, I'm sure that you will enjoy reading The Key To The Indian. I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars because of the thrilling adventure that Omri and his father go on. The book also includes historical features, relating to Little Bear and his bout with the Europeans trying to conquer the new land. I recomend that anyone who enjoys reading Lynne Reid Banks' work."
5,Love this stuff,"In the past year and 4 months i have lost 50 pounds. I'm not saying that this tea is the magic pill, however, I believe that it has helped. This tea is great on a cold day because it has a touch of cayenne pepper. I put spenda in it and sip it while I'm on the computer or traveling in the car. I found it at a health food store and then they stopped carrying it. I bought two cases from Amazon. It helps with appetite control."
3,Brutool Lagerhead,This is a cute idea. Bought it for when our son in law comes. He likes Black and Tans. Will have fun with that.
3,Simple Black & Tan maker,"I bought this for my sister who just learned she loves drinking Black & Tans. This was a simple, thoughful gift. Good choice."
5,Perfect Black and Tans,"I have not tried the spoon with a bent handle but this turtle works as advertised. Even if you have never tried to pour a black and tan you should be able to get a perfect separation on your first try with this one.Might I suggest you try Black and Sam which is Sam Adams Boston Lager under Guinness, or if it is summer where you're at, substitute Sam Adams summer brew for the lager. Have fun and enjoy!"
5,Black and Tan Heaven,"Awesome unique gift. Bought 3, gave 2 as gifts and kept one for myself. It works wonderful and I use it at least once a week."
5,A Black & Tan Must,This Lagerhead Turtle makes the most beautiful Black & Tans I have ever seen. The turtle's mouth serves as a bottle opener and the turtle's legs simply drape over the opening of your pint glass allowing you to slowly pour your stout over the turtle's shell. No more holding onto a spoon while trying to pour...simply terrific!
4,Review,It fits most class sizes. Very creative and fun when having people over.Only dislike it that it was slightly bent near the base of its neck. Otherwise great product.
3,How to win at the races,"This book eventually gets into handicapping the races but it is sort of outdated but, if you're beginning to handicap the horses this book might be helpful."
5,"a wonderful book! read, learn and earn!","The original title of this book says it best: the education of a horseplayer. Simply put, the more educated a handicapper you are, the better your chances at winning at the track. Learn the racing game from one of the legends of the sport: Sam ""The Genius"" Lewin, and walk away from the track with a fatter wallet too!"
5,Hamilton better than ever,"Scott Hamilton decamped for the London jazz scene many years ago but returned to New York recently to record this album with the sterling Bill Charlap trio. He's better than ever. Fans of tenor-sax, swinging jazz are urged to add this CD to their collection."
4,Great for use overseas,This was one of the single most useful products I brought with me while spending a year overseas. My US cookbook was in pounds and ounces but all newspaper recipes and storebought goods were in metric weights. This scale allowed me to convert accurately and to use the right amounts without the right measuring cups.
4,Great Scale but can be a battery hog,I really love my new scale. It is extremely accurate and measures to .05 of an ounce. I love the reset feature. It lets you reset the weight to zero so that you can exclude the weight of plates and bowls from your measurements. My only complaint about this scale is that it has used up three 9 volt batteries in the 1 month that we've had it. I thought it had a feature where it shuts off if you forget and leave it on but the feature does not seem to be working. My husband has threatened to send it back if it uses up any more batteries. I would be really sad to see it go.
3,I returned mine,"This machine got great reviews and perhaps my expectations were to high. When I recieved this in the mail, and after examining it, I promptly returned this item. Why... I felt it was flimsy, the plate on top is made of plastic and did not seem very durable. The machine can do grams and ounces but the button to make the change is on the bottom of the machine. You actually would have to lift it up to switch from one to the other. Maybe I have been spoiled as my last electronic scale was all stainless steel and any buttons that needed to be used were on the front or side of the machine. Although not terribly expensive, I still expected more than what I got when I purchased the Soehnle Scale."
4,Aussie Dominatrix in Your Ear,"She cajoles you to ""Work harder!"" ""Come on, speed up!""Which is a good thing. You can press the button at any time, and she will read out your heart rate. One complaint is, I can't figure out how to skip the 5-minute warm-up, and you don't get any credit for calories burned on the warm up. The cool-down at the end, you can skip."
3,thin,"product looks nice ... I am sure the kids will like haveing the color coordinated remotes.... however one complaint is that it is thin... so it is not durable enough to tke on and off.... carefull putting it on... the gren one just like this ripped! good news is that it is thin enough that you may be ble to use it witht he wheel, or band hero add-on's I have not tried it yet...over all it is nice! just thin!"
3,Ok but ripping,It was ok until my son opened it and when he was putting it one his wii remote it ripped
1,It's not 2 Tone,"I received this item and it's just 1 Tone, forget about 2 Tone as it is shown on the image. Additionally I don't like the smell of this stuff, it has a very characteristic odor. I know this is cheap (well shipping is not), but believe me, it looks cheaper than his cost, don't waste your money on this."
3,"Not a bad read, but don't expect thoroughgoing farce--","""Harnessing Peacocks"" is a sometimes comic, sometimes slice-of-life novel about a prostitute who takes up gourmet cookery and earns money at both so she can send her child to a fancy boarding school. With great effort she keeps her personal and private lives separate. You know, of course, the dam has to break at some point or there wouldn't be a book.Perhaps it's just my American impatience but I thought the book took too long to get off the ground. Characters' habits and daily activities were explored more than necessary and by the time the farcical elements got going, I felt relief more than enthusiasm. Still, the writing was excellent and the characters were well drawn. I can see why Wesley is a popular author in her native Great Britain."
1,Butchered Mozart and Back into parts and pieces - is this an EMI promotion DVD?,"Warning to all and anyone looking at the possibility to buy this item:NOTE: This is a butchered Mozart and Bach.The piano concertos here are not the complete concertos; They are parts and movements FROM THE CONCERTOS.The Mozart No. 18 has the Finale only, the Bach no.5 has part II, and part III only.The Mozart No.9 has the finale only, and No.20 has movement I & II.One should wonder about EMI's wisdom of releasing this failed edition.Is it a promotion DVD? If it is, then EMI should say so.Shame on you, EMI.Conclusion: Avoid..."
5,Very entertaining,"Andsnes plays with the Norwegian Chamber Orchestra in an beautiful old Norwegian Post Office - a very intimate setting - the orchestra of 20-30 players and Andsnes both conducting and playing. This is a live performance. They chose (rather to play entire concertos) to play various movements from Mozart (no. 18,9 and 20) and Bach's 5, as apparently was often normal at Mozart's time. Both Andsnes and the orchestra plays with a crips, lively sound and very much makes the music alive. As a watcher of the DVD you almost feel present at the concert. Between the pieces Andsnes gives some short commentaries on the works and there are also a longer interview in both norwegian and english where he talks about mozart and his career as such. Highly recommended for this fresh approach and great atmosphere."
5,"A ""Great Game"" classic","This is an exciting adventure book, writen in 1876 about the travels of a British Army Captain through Western Siberia into Khiva, a city in Central Asia recently taken by the Russian Empire. It purports to be just travel by an army man at liesure, and wanting to see parts of the world. Since we are in the ""Great Game"" era, when Britain and Russia were contending for the countries around India, I have the feeling that it was more than that, and that the author's mission was somewhat akin to ""checking out the land"" in the case of an impending conflict. Anyway, it's extremely well-written, and the descriptions of both the places and the people are first rate! The author obviously had a keen eye, and I would really love to read the report he actually submitted to his superiors in London when he returned. I'm sure it's still buried deeply in their secret files."
2,Stuck in Fast Forward,"I am a WWII aviation junkie, and the books I enjoy most are the ones that give the reader a feeling of actually ""being there"" in the day-to-day operations of a combat unit. This, unfortunately, is NOT one of those books. I'm sure Grp Captain Billy Drake had a fascinating career in the RAF, but one would never know it from this bare-bones collection (104 pages) of reminiscences. No details are given of his 24+ aerial victories beyond the aircraft type. Whereas he spends paragraphs talking about what unit was affiliated with which group, etc. I have to say that I was very disappointed by everything except the dust jacket illustration by Nicolas Trudgian. My advice would be: re-read ""Thunderbolt,"" ""An Ace of the Eighth,"" or ""The Big Show"" instead."
4,Quite a good set of movies.,"I don't fall under the demographic for these movies (I am male in my20s), but I am greatly surprised at these movies. The acting was really great, which is great because I was expecting annoying teenager girls (no offense).This set comes with both movies presented in widescreen format. The discs are in thindiscs cases, which makes it kinda annoying for people who want to not keep them in this collector box. Also included is the first book that inspired the movies (sorry, I haven't read it.)Let it be known that this movie can entertain viewers of all demographics."
5,"Great stories, good buy","These two movies are very well done, and the price was very reasonable. This is a good buy for anyone who likes these movies and/or the book series."
3,Okay,"The original ""erotica"" or at the very least, one of the popular ones. I had a hard time getting into this story & couldn't see what all the fuss was about :)"
1,Picture and Dimensions are INACCURATE,"Before buying this item I read some of the reviews. There was one negative review about the dimensions being inaccurate and several positive reviews explicitly stating that this item ""will fit in a toaster oven"". I made the mistake of actually believing all of the positive reviews.THIS ITEM IS NOT 10.6"" wide. I'm holding it with tape measure in my hand right now and it measure 11.5"" wide. It DOES NOT FIT in my 11"" wide toaster oven.THE PICTURE IS INACCURATE. The actual item has ""lips"" on two of the sides to hold onto. These ""lips"" are what make the item 11.5"" wide.I have double checked the item number on the Amazon website with the number on the UPC so I know Amazon did not make the mistake of sending me the wrong item.DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM IF YOU WANT IT TO FIT IN A MEDIUM SIZED OR SMALLER TOASTER OVEN."
1,Wrong Dimensions in Product Description,"I bought this to cook in a toaster oven,but the dimensions are really11.5"" x 7.4"" x 1.25"".It doesn't fit and not worth the bother to return. So it's Hammer Time! Music please....."
5,great muffin pan,I bought this to use in my toaster oven and it is perfect. I love the finish on it. It is really easy to clean and everything bakes up very good.Another thing I like is that it doesn't warp. This is a very nice pan and I am proud I bought it.
1,I hate candy now...,"because of this song. I know candy is used as a metaphor, but... good golly gosh! What thug rapper goes rapping about candy and going to the candy shop? We see here a great rapper with weak material. Major let-down..."
3,not thick,I would recommend getting a thicker wool mattress cover. This one packs out and doesn't provide much cushion at all.
2,For Love of Country???,This book is quite confusing! It goes in circles trying to define two concepts; nationalism and patriotism. By the time that you are finished you will have read through about every theory out there on the two themes...but it is as if everything is thrown at you. I have read this book for a Master's course and each one of us had a completely different take on the book. This book is for someone who has an solid knowledge of the formation of the nation-states in Europe. Also it would have brought the point home more if the author had provided translations of the german and italian texts found in the footnotes.
2,"Skillet, please","This is an odd little gadget. I bought it on recommendation from my neighbor, but I failed to see it in action, let alone sample the results.I started out by making some of the hot pockets, all of which came out much better in a cast iron skillet.I tried to make some snacks using bread, but no loaf of bread had slices big enough to ensure a seal all the way around. Most didn't come close. Makes you wonder where it was designed. I now have a breadmaking machine that makes really large slices, so I might dig the Snackster out and try it again. If I want to face the fussy cleanup, and if I can't find my skillet.I'd like to have a dollar for every one of these that sits forgotten in the kitchen cabinets of America."
3,Good but doesn't last long,"This is not a bad little sandwich maker. The pockets are narrow so the fillings do squeeze out the side. It is easy to clean. Unfortunately, it is not very long-lasting. One of the plastic light covers came off about 3 days after I purchased it. The other one popped off about one month later. I have had it for about 5 months now and the cord apparently has shorted out. I have to wiggle it for five minutes before I can get the sandwich maker to turn on. Since my kids are hooked on the grilled cheese sandwiches I make in it, I will be heading out to buy another sandwich maker. I just don't think it will be this brand again."
4,"Very nice, but...","It seems like the place where you put the bread is slightly too big for normal sized bread - the bread doesn't get sealed around the edges and the filling (cheese especially) oozes out and gets in the little crack around the grilling surface. Also, thick slices of bread will push forward when you close the griller. Other than that, it makes great sandwiches"
3,andy griffith cd,"I was looking for mountain folk music more like what I have heard on the original Andy Griffith show. So I was a little disappointed in the cd, but the price was good for the product. The musical quality of the recording was good also. So, all in all it was an ok purchase and I will still keeping looking for a recording more like the original tv show sound."
1,This cd sux,"Never buy this cd. This cd compares with a cat screeching. The music is horible, and the songs are not original versions. If you are sane, NEVER buy this major POS. The guy on top that rated this cd well is deaf probably. Buy any other cd but this."
1,Incorrect Image of CD,The CD I received doesn't not match the image on the Amazon order list. Nor does the songlist. I am very disappointed.
2,nothing more than a boring textbook,"Thomas Hine's ""The Rise and Fall of the American Teenager"" is based on a very interesting topic, one which I was extremely excited to learn more about. However, when I began reading the book, I was immediately turned off by Hine's writing style. Hine took a topic that could have been a great work of sociology, and turned it into nothing more than a textbook of history. Occasionally, he gets off topic, and uses first person not to share his own experiences, but to say something like, ""I have already talked about..."" His sources aren't cited in the text, and his sentences are short, choppy, and have no real flow to them. He often touches on greatness and his writing at times flourishes, but for the most part, the book reads like a poorly completed textbook. Everything I got from this book's 300 pages can be gathered by simply reading the inner sleeve of the cover and the preface. No real need to waste your time here."
4,Historical chronology of adolescence,"Hine has given readers the opprotunity to see into the development of one of the most interesting creatures in the known universe, the american teenager. Readers are taken on a journey from the days when young people (teens) were called young adults to today where adolescence has been prolonged into the middle 20's to early 30's, in some cases. Why? Hine ties it all to the development of and mandatory attendance at high school. Without it, young people would have a harder time developing their own since of culture seperate from the larger culture of society."
3,The rise and fall of the American Teenager,"In The Rise and Fall of the American Teenager by Thomas Hine we are introduced to the old and modern teenager. Hine uses socialogical, psichological and anthropological data, we realize that it is not always crystal clear. It is a moving historical process, therefore there are many different elements that must be considered when attenting to understand today's dynamic teens. We must keep in mind that we cannot solely view teens through our modern lens, but must be aware of what has come before.In today's job market a high school diploma, and even arguably a college degree, is essential for success."
4,it was the saddest book in the series!,"it was so sad! peggy has to help her new friend,violet, deliver messages and they have lots of adventures,but thats not the sad part.the author kills off my favorite character! (don't worry-i won't give it away) and the character is so brave and probably would have done great things.the person was sensitive,nice,and loved their family.i think you definetly have to read this,but be prepared! your heart will break in two when the character says his/her last goodbye."
3,Sweet Valley Twins,"It looks like two books with the same title are being reviewed here, ""The Orphan Train"" and ""Sweet Valley Twins."" I'm going to review the Sweet Valley Twins book. In this story, Jessica and Elizabeth learn an artificial code language called ""ithig."" They promise to keep it a secret and not teach it to anyone, but they eventually bend and teach the whole school. Now the whole school knows the ""ithig"" language, and they plan to play a trick on a new teacher. And as always, Elizabeth comes to the rescue. I think it's a fun book to read, but it's not one of the best in the Sweet Valley Twins series. The story isn't very realistic, and the kids seem to catch on to the new language much too quickly. But it's fun, so I'll give it 3 stars."
3,Ithig??????!!,"Mr.Ned Wakefield teaches Jessica and Elizabeth,his twin daughters,a secret language called Ithig(The ..word?..ithig is placed between syllables).The two do their best to keep the language a secret but their friends start acting like brats,feeling hapless that the secret will not be shared with them.Soon,the language is all around school!!Uh-oh!"
1,Neveer received,"I did not receive my blouse. After contacting the company twice, I never received and answer from them. VERY disappointed..."
1,shockingly bad,"I rented this DVD in a desperate attempt to find some stand-up comedy that I haven't seen and I couldn't believe how terrible every aspect of it was. Not ONE of these comedians were funny, not in the slightest. It seemed to me that Jamie Foxx (whom I don't like much, either...he likes to rip off richard pryor) simply found a bunch of friends of his to go on stage and pretend to be comedians. Not only did none of them even make me giggle, several of them REALLY annoyed me. I found myself cursing at the television, wanting them to just shut the f*** up."
4,Nostalgia for the 1960's,"Reading Flyoverland creates a nostagic feeling for anyone who grew up in a small town in the 1960's, but even more than that it reaffirms the value of commmunity, no matter where you live. Max and Charlie move with ease and comfort through their little town, where people know them and watch out for them. It's easy to picture the boys, who imagine themselves to have the sleuthing skills of Charlie Chan, persist in try to solve a murder. The charming and quirky characters they interact with are not unlike people I remember from my own childhood. A fun read!"
5,These Great Cowboy Sidekicks,I grew up watching these actors. I loved going to the movies. This book was well writen. had alot of good information about the actors. I liked the photos as well as the stories about the person. I think the book is above average.
1,THIS BOOK IS A FRAUD,"I should have been alerted by the old dates of the previous comments. The book is badly printed on very cheap paper, so bad as to be unacceptable. Illegible type! Muddy reproductions! An insult to Covarrubias!Amazon has allowed a return. But they really should not be listing it.Product Description: ""Hesperides Press are republishing these classic works in affordable, high quality, modern editions, using the original text and artwork."" THIS IS A LIE!1. It cost (...).2. The name Hesperides does not appear in the book. No publisher would dare take credit for it.3. It is not a reprint using the original text and artwork. It is a photocopied facsimile.4. The ""Look Inside"" is a different, better produced book."
3,The Original Mix Isn't THAT Bad,"The mixes are great, but the original isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Sure, it's pretty commercial, but what do you expect from Ian Van Dahl?The original is still fast-paced and is pretty much a driving song, not a dancing song. It's something to play if you're out for a cruise in a car that has a heavy stereo and racing-grade handling. I keep it in the car on a cd with the Club Mix of Foggy - Come Into My Dream.Ian Van Dahl tracks are about vocals. It's a refreshing change from similar releases who cover up the shortcomings of their vocalist with overbearing beats and synth (ie anything that comes out of France =)"
1,This was never actually released.,I don't know why Amazon still has this item listed as it never made it through to production. I'm just writing this so no ones goes to the trouble that I did to look for it. It would be pretty awesome if it were to eventually be released though. Here's hoping!
5,The Munsters - America First (docum.),"The Munsters - America's First Family of Fright was an excellent documentary and I love it's. If you an fan of the show,you have to purchase this one for your collection, if you do not have it."
3,Original Rave,"The original version of ""Rave On"" is there ! The record begins pretty strongly with ""Sweet Rockin' Baby"" and ""Rock-Ola Ruby"", of course. But the rest is not so high. In these remote times, Sonny West was really close to Buddy Holly but the best was Holly, definitely ! Anyway the cd is full of informations with excellent liner notes and a set of photographs depicting West's career. This very well produced cd is about the history of rock'n'roll. It is for historians !"
2,"great band, weak show, weak video","this band was great, but this dvd is pretty bad. it seems to be filmed by a few amateurs and there isn't even direct audio!i think solid state records bought a bootleg off some kids..check out their cds, beloved were an amazing band. buy a shirt or hoodie on their store or solid states if you want to support them, but this dvd will surely dissapoint someone who wants to experience their live performance."
1,MARGINAL PRODUCT - DOESN'T INCLUDE TECH SUPPORT,"This product is simple enough for a basic website containing only buttons and text. Conversely, it is terrible if you want to do anything marginally advanced. Fusion's automation is limited to the very basic functions of building a site. Try importing a database file with links and you'll be very dissapointed that you now need to re-link all of the fields with their respective destinations.Need help? ...does not include any technical support."
5,NetObjects Fusion MX,"I've been using NetObjects 5.0 for the past year, and wanted to purchase a web authoring program for home use. When NetObjects MX came, I was initially disappointed. All of the wonderful styles were missing that I'd been using with 5.0. Well, some were there, but not all. As soon as I figured out that the 5.0 styles (and more new ones) could be downloaded from the company's site, I was content.This program is easy to use, and is compatible with all browsers (unlike Netscape Composer which might be free, but has bug problems for those who use MS Explorer as a browser. The Help section of the program, along with online advisors makes this a great program for beginner and professional alike."
3,OK TITLE,"I must agree with the Reviewer above me (Grypton)Very poor transfer,perfectly watchable though,but should have been much better.There is no excuse for Artifacts and Bad compression on a 2011 release.But as a Paul Nashy fan I had to have it."
4,This is a good stretching book.,This is a good stretching book. It starts with basic issues and move forward to advanced issues.
2,nothin to be inpressed with,very kraftwerkish to say the least. i myself am not a huge kraftwerk fan. which would explain why i dont like it. but for those of you who like to listen to westbam and kraftwork and terroregroupe then this is your album. oh by the way..this was in the big lebowski.
3,Better Than the 1st but Still Average...,"There were about 3 or 4 songs I liked, but that's about it. The rest were rather boring. I did like this one better than the first tho, because I liked more songs on this CD than the 1st."
5,Drums of Darkness book sent quickly great packaging,The book arrived very quickly and was packaged so well that nothing could possibly have harmed it. Highly recommended service.
3,"Great bread, poor electrical system","I received a machine for Christmas nearly 2 years ago. It lasted about 8 months, making slightly less than one loaf a week. The relay that controls the heating element went out, and I had to move the loaf pan to the regular oven to finish the loaf. Tried it on another loaf and had the same result.Wrote to Breadman and they did replace the machine with a used one which had a scratched pan, which they also replaced. Now, the second machine is failing in the same way as the first, the heater relay is going out. This one has only made maybe 6 loaves. I am now trying to do comparisons so I can get a machine that will last longer. I do like having the home made bread."
3,Spare Parts?,"This is a great machine, but my belt broke that turns the paddles on the bottom and the company, after repeated emails and phone calls, does not seem to offer any support for their product. No parts are available, their only solution was to sell me a refurbished at half price. Any chance another reader would know of a resource for a belt? Other than no support when the machine breaks, it was a great machine while it lasted.Know of spare parts? tapage62@hotmail.com"
1,A Second Look,"This is my second time here.... as I said in my previous review, I was operating on my second machine which was sent to me (used) by Breadman when the first one failed. Well, the second one failed after only 8 uses and Breadman completely ignored my emails.. I even offered to buy another Breadman if they could tell me if there was a better and more reliable model. The only answer to that was that they said they would be happy to sell me another machine.My solution to this problem was to buy a Zojirushi. Much better. Less noise, better texture to the bread."
4,not bad!,"not a bad book, thin but many black and white pictures of the falcon and thor missiles and 2 pictures of the Navaho. kind of achildrens book, but where else can you find material like this?"
2,Short.,"I didn't realise -- it was probably my mistake -- how short the program was. A bit disappointing... The documentary is OK, tough."
1,Disappointed !!,I was all excited when I found this program but failed to read the system requirements . All I knew was that it was for a Mac. I was very disappointed to find out that I needed a Palm also. Don't you have any programs that I can just load in my computer and play? I would be thrilled!
4,Not bad,"When watching this film it's obviously all about the plot and dialogue. Honestly, I think it's creative... but if it was a full scale major motion film you would need a great cast. It has an x-men element to it, but with a more realistic twist. I like that. No weird costumes (other than the cloak). Hopefully we'll see this as a real movie one day!"
3,Storyboard always lacks interest.,"It's great that Amazon wants opinions prior to shooting the movie. But a movie storyboard is always lacking in detail, and is slow paced. It's hard to hold interest by simply animating the storyboard as they have done here. Normally, a storyboard is a series of still images that a viewer can go through at their own pace, the same as reading a book. Different people read at different speeds.I stopped watching part way through this presentation. The pace was simply too slow for me. Also, if I was editing the movie I would have cut out the intro and speeded up the childhood scenes. The stress on emotional sensitivity is another area that was leaving me cold. Sensitivity needs to be there, but there doesn't need to be another story within the story about it."
3,average intresting twist,an intresting idea got bored watching it didnt like the artwork but listened to it all the way. think it would make a decent live actoin movie
3,"not the best, not the worst","It was a cute plot line with some interesting twist and turns. It was a little slow in the beginning, but it picked up speed. The script could some work, it was flat in many of the dramatic scenes."
2,Couldn't watch much,"The story idea is lame to start with. It's already been done in various formats before. The animation was too choppy. (I'm aware it was made that way to start with.) The opening gave no idea of what was happening and the viewer is slammed into the middle of something that seemed to have nothing to do with the opening sequence. If your going to create a test film, it should at least be better than something I can pull up on u-tube. Take a look at VODO movies. Many of those were done by people that have far less money available to them than Amazon and they've done a much better job. I couldn't watch much more than the first few scenes as the jumpy action and disjointed aspect of the thing just made me lose interest."
1,Interesting,"No, I would not see this in a theater nor would I spend the money to rent it. I would watch it for free on Netflix or on Amazon.It's rather creative to be sure but the quality of the voice actors leaves something to be desired.Must be my connection speed because it seemed choppy but maybe that is how it's supposed to be.I don't know.Kudos to the writer. Sorta been done before but never like this.Thought it was going to be live action. Guess I was wrong."
3,"I liked it, but it did remind me of the X-men, the comics","I enjoyed watching it from the start but when I saw it was animated, like a comic strip kind of animation, I almost truned it off. The story then pulled me again, but when she started talking about her powers, how they started, how they were found and when she started at the special school it really reminded me of X-men, where they all had different ways of being special and different, misfits with powers. Even the way she couldn't get close to people like Rogue and she lost all the people in her life due to it. But it is written well and pulls you in like a cool cominc book story pulls you in..So I think it is interesting and I would be interested in seeing it as a movie, I don't know how well it would do since it is so similar to X-men but then again it does take you into a different idea of using the powers to help track down criminals in a very fast unusual way. If it was changed a bit epsecially in the beginning it might do well"
1,Another unwatchable Amazon test,"I was hoping the first Amazon test movie I watched was just a bad example. This one was even worse. I know this is a pre-production test, but I'm vague on what it is I'm supposed to like about it. The animation was so bad it was distracting. The voice actors lacked presence. I'm sure there was supposed to be a plot, but I was so put off by everything else I didn't stick around long enough to find out."
1,Who would pay?,Cartoons need to be seen on Saturday mornings. What is the point of all the full feature cartoons? At least you do not have to pay live actors.
2,Just not my cup of tea,"I didn't realize going in that the whole thing was...not even sure what that was. Not animated, really. It was as if someone had taken drawings and made a movie out of them, and not even from a good graphic novel. I couldn't get past that and the dialogue was stilted and predictable-what little I listened to. Others may find this interesting; after all, we all have different tastes, but it's not for me. At all."
4,Interesting Plot...X-men meets girl interrupted?,"I agree with the other reviewers that this test title is not very watchable as is. I only made it through twenty minutes or so, but the plot grabbed my attention and I thought it did a great job developing the main character, given the visual limitations. It could definitely make for an entertaining full production."
1,A 1hr 37min test commercial ... really ??,"2012NR: You could get just as valid predictive feedback from a well thought-out trailer (aka movie commercial) combined with an internet-based audience poll. Unless of course the intended audience are people who have nothing better to do than to watch a 1hr 37 min commercial about a product that doesn't yet exist. Can anyone say ""advance sale on partially built beach front condo's that never complete construction?"" ... MFJLabs -1x"
2,Not My Style,"I really tried to like this video, but it's not my style. I am not a fan of animated adult-themed presentations. I find it distracting. Video could use a bit more fine tuning and editing."
4,Touching Blue (Amazon Studios),"Touching Blue (Amazon Studios)I liked the movie..good concept for a movie, didn't expect an animation,can't wait to see what Amazon will do next.."
2,Old plot,"It sounds like I've heard this plot before. May be it's a combination of several old ones.The mechanism of the powers was all over the place. If someone has a power (ability) even if they don't completely understand it, they know how to use it. Like driving a car, you don't have to understand how it works but you know how to make it go. It appeared that no two people had the same power and they were all useful. That doesn't sound right.The FBI would not be the organization to do this type of thing. It should be just a non-descript (mysterious) agency.The subjects are treated like Pavlow's dogs."
3,Kept me interested,"I liked it, not loved it. The main character, Blue, was the main reason the movie kept my interest. She had enough back story and character to make it worth while. I would definitely have to watch as a movie just out of curiousity to see how it turned out. I have to question the sex scene. The movie seemed to have a PG13 feel to it, I believe it should push as far as it can go and keep it at a PG13 rating. I can't believe I am saying that being a 44 year old male that loves 80's horror movies. You know how they can be.The soundtrack could be a little more upbeat( goth dance metal maybe ) at times. I like the songs chosen for slow moody tunes.Would like to see how it would be filmed. Bright and sunny at spots, dark and broody when she goes into trance state maybe? At any rate, yes I would watch if the movie was made."
5,Best games in the universe!,"There should be screenshots of these games next to the word 'fun' in the dictionary. Absolutely addictive and very well priced. These are the top of the line in casual games. Also, check out the latest game in the 'Polar' franchise - it's called POLAR POOL! I think it's over on WildTangent's site."
4,Easy Fun,Easy to play games that provide some clean fun. This is appropriate for young ages and for families. It's very enjoyable.
1,Not working either,Couldnt get it to work either! Lost papers to return. So cant really say. Wont buy any more like these!!!
3,Older video game won't work and has no patches,This is an older version of this game and is listed as working with XP. IT WILL NOT WORK ON WINDOWS 7 EVEN IF YOU SET YOUR MACHINE UP TO RUN AS IF IT WERE WINDOWS XP. make sure your computer is compatible with this program.
2,Does not play on my Windows 7 computer,"This game works great on a computer running XP but even if I try the backward compatibility mode, I could not get it to work on my computer running system 7. It is really fun and it will challenge you before giving you access to different characters and different lanes. I don't remember the description saying it would not work on a system 7 computer. Bummer. Otherwise, I would rate this game much higher."
1,P C Games,"I will never order software through the internet again.The game I ordered will not work on my new computer. It is an old game, and will not work on Windows 7 Home Premium."
3,Game won't install in Vista 64 bit system,"We started playing this game over the web on the family's Wild Tangent account. The price of the CD from Amazon looked like a great deal. The catch is that the disc won't install on a 64 bit Vista system even though the games worked on that same system with Wild Tangent. The two games on the disc are great fun for the family and we were able to install them on our old XP 32 bit system. Bottom line, read the box carefully before you buy."
3,Becoming Out of Date,"I recently used this book to supplement my trip to Tokyo (March 2005). Of the four items I picked to see, none were still there or were lacking an essential item. Not speaking Japanese, directions in the native language did not reveal the new location. I ended up wasting many hours. The publisher last issued this book in 1998. This is a shame since this book amply describes a plethora of places, and gives careful directions to each. After my fourth failure I sadly cast the book aside. Careful directions in Tokyo are a blessing. Most of the venues in the book are not mentioned in the major travel books. The publisher and author would do well to offer an email or Web-accessible forum. The address in the book for snail mail fails to entice me to send an update."
4,the most underrated blues guitarist ever,"play loud...very loud! nothing quite matches this. cant understand how johnny winter has attracted so little critical acclaim, this album is just electrifying."
4,Exciting Stuff,"I found the first two thirds of this book exciting and very interesting, the author certainly was a brave lady who played a significant part in the Civil War (masquerading as a man). Just how significant is open to debate as some historians say her claims are embroidered.Anyway, I started to lose interest towards the end of the book as it got a bit weighed down with factual information such as letters from Generals etc about the Civil War, which I am inclined to think the author added to add weight to her elaborated claims about her involvement as a spy! Regardless it is an exciting read, and a good historical account of battles during the Civil War."
3,Not too good,"This product is supposed to allow a person to control their pooch by yanking on it, causing the halter to pull up at the check area. The problem is that my dog just ignores the pulling and continues to pull on the leash. Then, if we try to make him keep still, he wriggles out of the arm areas so that we're left to controlling him through the collar portion - so we went back to using a regular harness."
5,The Great Manfred Mann!,"Manfred Mann were one of the best but least know of the bands of the British Invasion. Their hits ""Do Wah Diddy Diddy"", ""Sha La La"", and ""Pretty Flamingo"" are here along with other great songs Like ""Come Tomorrow"" and ""I'm Your Kingpin"". The major problem with the band was that they couldn't decide if they were a jazz/blues band or a pop band. They performed each genre at an extremely high level and their albums were a mixture of both. To some of the people buying their records at the time, this was not a problem, but for the majority it was. Buy this for all the great music and make your own conclusion."
1,Non-stick coating comes off in food,"I looked for a good electric wok to replace the Westbend I have had for over 10yrs. The Maxim ""Profesional"" seemed to be the best of what was available in the market. The first one I purchased had a visible surface coating defect in the bowl. After taking that back to the original store purchased for exchange, the new one looked fine. The first time we cooked in it we had a rude surprise. The non-stick coating was flaking-off. Keep in mind it had only been washed with warm/soapy water and used once. I noticed several areas where the coating had bubbled above the heating element in the cooking bowl and any rubbing at all would remove the coating. Calling Customer Service at Salton USA, I found out that because they don't make or have that wok anymore, they can't repair or replace it per their ""warranty"". Any refund is based on having a reciept. For free OBO - wok, used once, includes unknown food additives."
2,Disappointed,"I looked forward to using my brand new Maxim Wok however, I found that the food sticks to the bottom, even though I used cooking spray, water and sometimes a little oil. I have used it 3 times and each time more of the coating comes off. It is not usuable at this time. I use the proper utensils and use only a sponge to wipe the surface. I have owned only one other wok (non electric) and never had this problem but I wanted a new electric one so I bought this one. I am very disappointed and will have to contact the manufacturer. I think the unit is defective."
2,TOO MUCH CINNAMON........,"The name is different from the taste, this tea taste mostly cinnamon not the orange spice tea I'm use to. I purchase other orange spice teas, I can taste the orange flavor. This tea should be call cinnamon tea."
5,Best Running Socks I've owned,"These are the best running socks that I have ever owned. For my first few 'trial runs' with them I came back feeling a bit confused - I didn't feel anything from them, then realized that this is was exactly what I was looking for from a sock. No bunching up, no rubbing on any seems, they wick away sweat build up perfectly. Lack a bit of padding for those that need it, but as a light weight sock they are great, just need to get used to the color!"
3,"Nice, but not nice enough","This classic and humble-looking toaster appealed to me for several reasons. Its price is right. It doesn't take up a lot of space. We had one almost just like it when I was a kid. It's made in the U.S.A. and Toastmaster is a trusty name.Unfortunately, for my purposes it had several distinct drawbacks. The slots are not long enough to accomodate conventional packaged rye bread slices. Just one more inch would have been enough. When toasting, you will hear a humming, zinging sort of sound, probably the timer - and the toaster vibrates ever so slightly. This didn't seem like a good sign. The nice-looking chrome gets very hot. My first piece of toast popped up energetically, but that slice of rye bread was unevenly toasted - that aside from the inch and a half that was completely uninfluenced by the heat of this toaster. So I would not recommend this toaster to anyone who objects to any or all of the above problems."
4,Questions of washing this filter,"I installed this filter into my car but I can't tell any performance different from a conventional filter so far. Perhaps time can tell? This supposed a washable filter. But it must use special solvent from the manufacture. There no cleaning instruction in the box, it only cautions not to use compress air or wrong type of cleaner. Load knows how much cost of the cleaning solvent? I am not too happy about that. But the filter looks very good.Kim"
3,No noticible difference but wont have to buy another filter,"In the past, have bought various high performance air intake systems for my vehicles and usually result in some performance or mileage gain. Bought this for my girlfriends '07 mustang V6 and did not realize much of any gain. Bought a similar one for my daughters Mazda 6 and did seem to get a ""throatier"" sound, a little better throttle response, but not much more. Generally, I think this is because they were just replacement filters that fit within the stock filter housing. For my other vehicles, I have purchased entirely new air filter intake systems which provide better air flow to the filter itself.These factory replacement filters are a fairly inexpensive way to slightly improve you vehicles performance as well as save you money in the long run as you never have to replace the filter again. My truck filter is $75!"
5,"Easy install, never have to buy another","This is my first K&N product and I bought it primarily because of some positive things I've heard from friends about K&N. The filter was a snap to install on a 2004 Mazda MPV, just two clips and drop it in. I didn't realize that it was washable so that was a bonus that when it's dirty I can just wash it off and put it back in. Not sure that I noticed any significant difference from having this filter."
2,"Great for Looks, not for Coffee","I bought the machine because of its looks. I returned the machine because the coffee was consistently lukewarm. If you depend upon a good HOT cup of coffee in the morning, this machine is not for you."
1,Don't buy this edition!,"OK, so clearly I was fooled by Amazon's practice of listing all reviews of a particular book regardless of edition. My mistake. The positive reviews this book has received are no doubt deserved, but this copy is unreadable. It is, as far as I can tell, a print-out of the public domain text, cheaply bound and so minimally formatted that italics are represented by _underscores_ and the right-hand margin is not even justified. The cover image isn't even correctly proportioned, which, given the original image, is pretty shocking in and of itself.I can't believe Amazon are even selling this thing. It's a disgrace. I could have produced a better copy myself for less money! The text is in the public domain, so if you don't care what format it's in, just download it for free and print it out. Otherwise, go for the new edition which got such good reviews."
5,Ekman edition is excellent,"Amazon has a weird policy of lumping together reviews for all the different editions of this book. The bound, Oxford University Press version, with commentary by Paul Ekman, is fantastic. None of the problems with other editions apply to the Ekman version. Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews - the Oxford edition will not disappoint. It has all the original text and photos, it is beautifully produced, and it includes lots of extras too in the form of Ekman's commentary and an essay on the famous illustrations."
1,Crappy edition,This edition is difficult and almost impossible to read because of the total lack of any readable lay out. Fotnotes are inserted into the main text without any change of letter size. The quality is very poor - a photocopy of the original is much better. Do not buy this crappy edition. If you want to save money visit the Internet Archive instead for a free pdf.
5,An enriching reading!,"This is the main contribution to interdisciplinary studies that converge in psychology and biology. It is a key piece inside Darwin `s work. If the well known decay of the compared psychology at the early years of the XX Century- when the evolutionism followers forgot about the behaviors and the psychologists did without anatomy and physiology- diminished briefly influence to the actual contributions, the culmination of the modern etiology has acted in favor for rediscover this extraordinary and even singular text.What Darwin considers as true expressions are precisely, the reflexes and instincts that suppose not only the innate capacity to react of a determined way, but also the innate acknowledgement of that expression in the others.A fundamental and unfairly not so known book that deserves to be recognized with major value."
1,I should have read the reviews first.,"The cover looks great, the print quality is clear... but the illustrations are missing.If you want this book in Kindle format, simply go to [...].You won't get a cover image, but the contents page has working chapter links and the reference links also work.Just get it from Project Gutenberg. It's free and complete."
1,"Amazon, please remove this item","I am very disappointed by Amazon advertising such a poor quality book. This is a cheaply produced facsimile that omits the illustrations. Because reviews of all editions of the book are included together, I believed I was buying Paul Ekman's excellent edition. Beware! Don't make the same mistake I did. I had to waste shipping costs to return this item."
3,Darwin's faked evidence,"To those evolutionary behavioralists who salivate over ""Emotions in Man and Animals,"" they'll get an even bigger charge reading it alongside ""The Great Betrayal: Fraud in Science,"" by Horace Freeland Judson, which has a nice expose of Darwin's fraudulent photos. Behavioralists will especially love reading about the expressions induced by powerful electrical shocks to the heads of mental patients. Of course, Darwin had the electrodes painted out of the photos; but then, This is Science! Other photos are actually paintings, and most are staged, not spontaneous. ""Emotions"" is nonetheless a good read, as Darwin could write as well as he lied."
3,Whither Doc?,"I like this disc, it's definitely a superior example of a sexy, saucy singer working across a range of older and newer styles, but it still lacks the special haunting something her debut ""Breath from Another"" had. Her ex-partner Doc has been lost (seemingly down the memory hole, as she never seems to even mention him), and some ephemeralness has been lost as well, replaced with a new brashness that sounds a bit desperate. And with artists like Nelly Furtado and Fiest, Esthero's call for a musical 'revolution' has been addressed by others in this vein capably enough to not mourn Esthero's absence too much. Esthero had something special in ""Breath""'s mash up of smoky trip-hop and sexy party-girl pop candy. ""Wikkid"" has a simpler personality - tho it is especially good ear-candy itself - and leaves a fainter impression because of it. Very good, but still a disappointment."
4,a different esthero,"""Breath From Another"" is one of my all-time top ten favourite albums. So to say I was excited to see Esthero was making a new one, is an understatement. I really liked the song and vid for ""we are in need.."" and was hopeful for the rest of the album to match what I know she can do.Honestly, I was a little disappointed. She has a fabulous voice and writes great songs, but the maturity and depth of ""BFA"" seemed replaced with bad girl posturing and breathy interludes. Not to say that this album still isn't 10 times better than what most females are doing. The songs are slick, polished and sexy. But the style I loved so from BFA seems lost. I believe if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
5,unparalle,"Esthero has fused crucial lyrics, commercial timing, and poetry to create a terrific album. The album's songs don't even require the words to prove how adamant esthero is about avoiding the unoriginal mode of today's music...instead the group has done something better...created their own revolution...great music on their own creative terms."
3,New Sound - Small disapointment,"The original sound of Esthero, for those discovered them in ""Breath from another"" was mesmerizing, deep and breathtaking.This album, however, is completely out of context and wanders through different style of musical tunes, teasing the audience with the soothing voice of the female singer without actually delivering the same enchantment of their previous album.It is a nice album, but a disappointing Esthero album."
2,"""A Musical Extermination""","""We are in need of a musical revolution...I'm tired of the same old...I want something more.""I couldn't agree more with you on that. But I have to tell you this isn't it. I will tell you what this is. A step above Fergie, a bit more creative but still a huge disappointment. A little bit of Jazz, a little bit of dance, and a lot a bit of hip hop. And while it does still sound like Esthero. It doesn't. She rehashes the same old same old superficial topics that appear on every hip/hop and pop album out there. The depth is fleeting. Sadly this album is not unique as much as it tries to be. One thing she does have is an amazing voice, I hear a bit of Bjork in there but much more polished.What happened to the harsh reality that slapped you in the face, the style, the essence that was born out of ""Breath from Another""?"
4,Esthero brings one home for Canada!,"After a 7 year break since Breathe from Another, I wasnt sure what to expect - but I must say I am very impressed with the latest Esthero release. This album is a little more jazzy than the last one, but Esthero all the way through. She is definately one of Canada's hidden talents, and I work hard at turning all my American friends into fans - even though after listening to the album, it doesn't take much convincing that she is a hit."
5,FUNKY,"This girl is great, her voice, her mix, her sound, her lyrics, every song is real, true and funky. Love this album!"
1,The Truth,"The first track 'We R In Need . . . ' is the only real 'song' on this CD. A decent balance of melody, hooked-music and lyrics that make good sense. Come on people let's open our ears and tell the truth."
2,Breathin' another kind of air...,"To be quick, I`d say I agree with my friend upside L Morrow.After the second listening, I gave up, I could not credit what I was listening to. Not good old Esthero. I keep an eye open on tendencies and bands and singers like Esthero o E. Torrini, Portishead, Mono, Aromabar, etc... (among other artists and styles), but to be honest, better ask for a friend to lend it before you buy. Much more worthy Mono's Formica Blues...However, gonna give it a 3rd chance. Everyone deserves it..."
1,Mediocre at best.....and utterly BORING !,"You would think that this is an exciting release at first sight, containing not only a CD but a DVD as well - however, I was thoroughly disappointed !14 trax ""off the rack"" which have been released time and again on just soo many greatest hits compilations etc.The DVD contains interviews with 4 ""musical enthusiasts"" who tell the story of Dionne's career from the early 60s up to the present but with only 5 or 6 still pics and some 30 secs of live footage it quickly becomes boring as it lacks any kind of distance to the subject.Definitely a discount product which is utterly dispensable - such a pity when you contemplate that Ms. Warwick is undoubtedly one of the greatest stars of the last 40 years.In stead turn to David Nathan's fabulous book, ""The Soul Divas"" which is much more informative, not only on Ms. Warwick but on a dozen or so other Afro-American singers."
1,RIP OFF,"When I saw the SAME songs on the cd, I wouldn't have left it in the store, even at a going out Business sale where I paid about $5 for it. HOWEVER when I saw there was a bonus DVD I thought well, maybe some clips of Dionne from the 60's...well worth buying...NOT...instead we get 4 Fans talking about WHY they like Dionne Warwick...LOL......WHO ever made this cd needs to be horse whipped!"
1,An artificial effort,"I am in agreement with the previous reviewer, Mr Hufford, about the artificiality of this effort.I am sorry, I am repulsed not so much by this recording on its own merits, but by the sheer artificiality of the effort. The repulsion is strictly visceral, but so what? Isn't music a visceral experience (unless you like to listen to John Cage)? Like when Clint Eastwood dubbed Charlie Parker, it is just wrong in my book. The pops and clicks can go, the treble can be boosted, but somehow this overdub steals from the work of the original artist, who was expressing his art in context with the medium at hand. I would rather hear a Caruso impersonator playing with a modern orchestra.But heck, I'm the kind of person who can't (won't) listen to Wagner because I am Jewish."
5,"IF U WANT ONE STEREO CARUSO CD THIS IS IT, IT SHOULD BE CALLED CARUSO 2001!","DO NOT BUY CARUSO 2000, NOT MANY GOOD SONGS!CARUSO2000 ONLY HAS ONE GOOD SONG, REAL CLASSICS ARE HERE LIKE SANTA LUCIA, O SOLE MIO RULES! ONLY THING MISSING IS EXTRA ECHO ON CARUSO'S VOICE, ORCHESTRA COULD HAVE BEEN LOUDER SOMETIMES IT SOUNDS AS IF IT WAS RECORDED ON FARM, BUT GOOD TO KNOW MAESTRO WAS BROUGHT BACK, CHISELED OUT FROM VINYL PuRGATORY! GOOD MUSIC FOR TIME TRAVEL, PAST & PRESENT TOGETHER!"
4,The Tubes (including Todd) excelled at sampling in '85.,"It's true, Side 2 (tracks #6 through #14) is one of the best album sides that Todd Rundgren ever produced (he was listed as a member of the Tubes in the liner notes of this album only). You'll hear a continuous flow (over 19 minutes) of songs and musical interludes that were creative, innovative, and fun, and still entertains and energizes me. If you've never heard this CD before, just start with track #5 and let it play!"
4,Very slick and catchy.,"The entire second half of this album is nearly flawlwssly crossfaded as one long dance track. Beginning and ending with ""Night People"", The Tubes take the listener on a wild journey of Muscle Girls, Eyes, Say Hey, Feel It, For A Song, and a most amusing hybrid -- Percy Faith's ""Theme From A Summer Place"" cheek-by-jowl with the party anthem ""Woolly Bully."" And, oddly enough, it works. The first half is vintage Tubes -- the more than competent guitars, the not-so-standard chord changes, and the synthetic creativity all combine to keep your head bobbing, regardless of their lyrical absurdism. The only thing that could be even remotely considered a hit from this album is the opener, ""Piece By Piece."" The only reason I can imagine that this Tubes outing didn't go over as well as their others is that by 1984, time had passed The Tubes by. It's a shame, because there really isn't anything like them in pop music today. But I suppose that might be a good thing!"
1,"For the love of God, AVOID!!!!","Oh man, what an 80's damaged tragedy..Coming off of their biggest commercial sucess(OutsideInside), the Tubes team with Todd Rundgren(a 'red flag' if ever there was one!) to produce this flailing, clumsy grasp at 80's smooth dance-rock.I can't sugarcoat it, 'Love Bomb' is just an awful record by a band that was capable of so much more.This album has not aged well..Think of the worst elements of 1980's production; the tinny synths,the digital drums,un-inventive audio 'sampling'..its all here, folks. Whats NOT here is the patented Tubes humor ,social satire, and amazing memorable hooks that they used to do so well up until this point.'Love Bomb' is , sadly, the sound of the Tubes out of ideas and giving up. Start at the self titled record and stop at 'OutsideInside' and pretend 'Love Bomb' never happened. I wish I had.Outside Inside"
4,Give it a spin.,"I have to strongly disagree with anyone that says that this album is a ""failure"". Although it may have been mis-timed in the career of The Tubes, the music on this record is definitely above average when compared to a lot of what was going on at the time, and the production is great. Easily as good as ""Outside Inside""."
4,Oh How I hated It.,"I hated this album when it was released in 1985. It just wasn't off-kilter enough for me, and I thought the songs weren't even on par The ""Outside Inside"", but it grew on me like a fine algae. Side one (at the time) contains cut after cut of fine songsmithing at work, Producer Todd Rundgren gives the band sparse sound and not their usual layered sound. Side two offers nonstop music with the songs bleeding into one another to great effect! The tunes side two are some pop gems and a couple nice crooners, too boot. Spooner sings his butt off and there is clever arrangements at work by the band here. Search this one out if you like The Tubes music, it won't disapoint. I understand sales were so bad the lable refused to promote it for very long, and it's too bad. For 1985 it was really an album made perfect for the times, it just didn't hit with radio listeners."
5,Vintage Tubes !!!!,Why this one fell flat on it's face in record sales is beyond me. Classic...knowing how to be commercial yet radical at the same time. Just about everything on this record works(with the exception of that little 30 second interlude Theme from a Summer place). Everything else is stellar....a must have AAAAAA +++++++.
4,High Quality Paper,"Excellent quality paper, matched with my Canon copier it worked very well. If not for the cost I would have given 5 stars."
4,Photo paper,The photo paper works fine. However I did notice some of the pictures came out with scratches on it. i don't know if it is my printer or the paper.
3,Good for the money,"Item is as described but my pictures came out a little too yellow in hue, might me due to my camera or a ink issue, paper looked good though, and dried super fast, at this price you cant compare. Same count for 40 dollars at most name brand stores."
4,Haven't used but Amazon service was awesome,Haven't used the paper yet since I haven't had time but the Amazon service was perfect as always! Came in a week earlier than expected and everything looks great!
4,Canon 4x6 Gloss Photo Paper Plus,"Good product. It's photo paper, so there's not much to write except for the fact that it works and doesn't suck."
5,Great service from Amazon,I bought this product and had to return it as it was not the right one for my hardware. This was the first time I was returning something which I cought from Amazon. They made the process so simple and easy to use. I am thankful to Amazon on this service.I would buy anything from amazon more than I used to as it is much better than seeing a not so happy face at the counter while returning the goods with a valid reason.
3,"Good quality, but prints fade faster than expected","These create really nice prints with my Canon photoprinter. Can't complain at all about how they look when new. They look like they came from a commercial service.However, I noticed that after about 1 1/2 years of hanging up near my desk some prints started to fade. They've gotten worse in the year since then. They weren't under glass, just literally taped to a shelf. I live 3 blocks from the ocean so a lot more humid than most folks see. That may have something to do with it. Whatever the situation, I'm using Canon paper with a Canon Pixima 780 and Canon ink and they faded pretty fast. Normally I'd expect that amount of fading over decades.Now that Costco, Wal-Mart, drugstores, etc. allow you to upload pictures and pick them up in an hour or so, I haven't printed at home. They even cost less and seem to not have fading problems. If I need instant gratification these are great, but for pictures that last I've gone back to the commercial services."
5,Printing photos anyone?,"I have used this photo paper for a long time. Your photos turn out so much nicer than what a photo lab does for you. The paper is thicker and more durable. The colors are vibrant. This paper never jams in my printer. I use several of the Canon photo papers and this one is the most popular especially if you are placing them in an album. The glossy paper shows up nicely in a photo album. If your pictures are going to be touched often by human hands, then you might want to choose a matte finish instead. Otherwise, I love this photo paper."
5,Great photo paper,"I used this paper to print borderless photos from my Canon i9100 printer for the first time, and was very impressed with the results - especially at the price! Highly recommended."
4,A visual stunner!,I found this book to be very user-friendly as well as thought provoking. Each page is inviting and motivates you to delve deeper within yourself. My favourites are the positive affirmations and the stunning visuals of relevant gemstones.I don't see myself becoming bored with this book any time soon!
1,"Noisy, unreliable machine","I bought one of these because I thought the automatic ""add ingredients"" feature was a good idea. I used the machine for about 4 months, making about 25 loaves of bread, none of which ever came out exactly right. They were all mishapen, sometimes grotesquely so. It often failed to incorporate ingredients from the corners of the pan. The motor sounded like it was about to die during the kneading cycle, suggesting to me that it was severely underpowered. Finally, the ""add ingredients"" feature ceased working, and I took it back to the store where I bought it.I'm an experienced breadmachine user and know the importance of accurate measurement, etc. However, this machine seemed unduly sensitive to the moisture content of the dough. All said, it's a turkey."
1,Breadman TR2200C Machine,First time we used it the spindle surface either disintegrated or was worn off in use. The spindle in the bread bucket was loose from that point on. The blade went up into the bread on the first rise and came off the spindle. Bread failed every time after that point. Also there was the banging in the bottom of the machine. Sounds like someone with a hammer pounding as long as the blade was moving. I sent it back-NO GOOD. I wanted to give it NO STARS!
2,Can't make recipes from other books,"I'm so frustrated with my new Breadman Ultimate. Long gone are the days of throwing ingredients from any bread machine cookbook in my old, cheap Oster and having the loaf come out PERFECTLY. This machine is significantly more expensive, and yet I can't get it to make a loaf that isn't complete mush in the middle unless it's a one-pound loaf.I ordered another Oster today; the Breadman's going in the pantry until I can figure out what the heck to do with it."
2,Hopefully third one will be a charm....,"I have been a fan of Breadman machines for at least 10 years now.So my existing Breadman Ultimate was starting to get pretty old. I figured I'd treat myself to a new one. Same buttons, same model number etc. Identical.Bought one at a local store. Hmm.... it burned everything on the sides. And this was using Breadman's own recipes, as well as some of my own. Exchanged it. Same thing. I tried making the crust as light as possible, and even using a custom program to reduce the baking time. This just was not right.So I just got my third one today, this time from Amazon.com. This one seems OK, thank goodness.Anyway, I wish I could give the product 5 stars because when they work right they are fantastic.But having two defective machines in a row is unacceptable. Therefore, for now, it only gets two stars. If I have any trouble at all with this third Breadman, I will be switching to the Panasonic bread machine instead."
2,Only good for white bread,"The breadman ultimate works well if you like white bread only. My family likes Rye, Wheat, and several grain bread. This machine can't handle kneading the heavy dough. I'm very disappointed since I read so many good reviews. Next time I wont buy an appliance on line since they wont take it back like stores would."
2,Mediocre,I had to replace the pan after it started leaking.I had to throw away the machine after it stopped kneading properly.These are not beginner problems: I am a very seasoned bread machine user and went back to my old machine where everything worked just fine once again (but without fancy features).
1,Breadman TR200C Ultimate Bread Machine,"This Breadman was advertised to be in ""Mint"" condition. I had it sent to My daughter's house. When she opened the exterior box she found the original box had been severly damaged and retaped to hold it together. When she oopened that box she found the lid of the machine to be cracked and broken in several places, there were dents on several corners and the interior had particles of bread crumbs like it had been used several times and never cleaned.I got on Amazon's site to send a report back to the sender asking them the process of returning the Bread Machine and refunding my money. I have not heard from anybody since. That includes Amazon as well as the sender, crzybulldogs."
3,Okay but with problems,"It bakes okay but: The dispenser for nuts/raisins is unreliable. The pan doesn't set well in the chamber and vibrates noisily. The paddle, geez the paddle... Why do they put teflon on this? It's fine for the pan. This isn't the only brand that coats the paddle with teflon. The teflon blisters and comes off the paddle and you're eating it! It doesn't help with removing the paddle from the bread anyway. One would think that the makers of bread machines would stop putting it on the paddles. There's already controversy about the health hazards of using teflon. Why doesn't the manufactorers just leave it off? It doesn't work anyway!"
3,kneading paddle,"I have used this machine for a year. Everything is good except the kneading paddle. This is an aluminum paddle driven by a stainless steel shaft. The paddle worn out in a few months and became very loose. Some users noted black grease at seal area, I think that's aluminum power mix with the dough. The non-stick coating on the tip of the paddle worn out too. I do put walnut and oatmeal in my bread. If you make only white bread you may not have the same problem. Next time I will look for a bread machine with stainless steel paddle and no coating."
2,Not happy - some shoddy material used,"The metal clips used to hold the pan in place are too soft. As a result, the pan will be rocked loose too easily. The earlier version of this breadmaker, which I used often during the past 5 years, did not have this issue. I may have to send it back."
5,New Breadman is the best!,"I recently purchased a Breadman TR2200C Ultimate Bread Machine from Amazon as a replacement for an old DAK that I think was one of the very first home bread machines to come on the market. WOW! Bread machines have come a long way, baby, from those first ones! In addition to having 84 choices of type of bread (white, french, sweet) crust (dark, medium or light)functions (regular, dough-make, bake-only)--these are just a few--the finished product is done to perfection. It is easy to operate, easy to clean, and the result is very satisfactory. I would recommend it to anyone either as a first machine or a replacement."
5,Works Great - Consistent results,"This is a great bread machine. A couple of things to note:1. They say to run a cycle to clean off any oils or material from manufacturing -- I called them on this due to concern about over-heating the breadpan when it's empty and next to the heating elements. They suggested about 1 inch of water in the breadpan. That worked fine, but a little aluminum foil to keep the water from splashing around helped.2. The breadpan is held in place by two stainless ""clips"" -- To avoid having the pan get loose during kneeding, pull them out from the sides of the unit slightly, so they ""grab"" the breadpan more firmly. This is also noted in the manual.3. They suggest putting the yeast on top of the flour. This may be okay for delayed preparation, but for immediate baking, put the yeast in with the liquids before adding flour.Loaves are the right shape, crust is perfect, it works."
1,Spend $50 more & buy the Zojirushi,"Our Zojirushi kicked the bucket after two years of hard and faithful service (3 times a week, every week). We decided to try the Breadman because it was cheaper. We returned it. Not only are the loaves very tall so that they are hard to cut and make huge sandwiches, but they do not taste as good as our Zo loaves (same recipe!). The crust is harder and rubbery tasting. Furthermore, the machine smelled like a skunk (even when not in use). Save yourself the grief and buy the Zo! It's great! We just sent away for a new one..."
2,Beats too hard?,"I have been making bread in a machine for quite a while now,and have a couple good books on machine bread.I recently purchased this machine as the old one went kaput.I have not had a loaf rise good yet.Even when I take the dough out and let it rise it won't.I think the motor goes too fast and ruins the dough or just beats it too hard.I can still use my old machine for kneading only and when I use it the bread rises ok.So???Also this is not a horizontal loaf."
1,Breadman TR2200C,"Poor quality construction, failed on the first usage. Do not recommend this item. Very disappointed with quality of build."
2,Greatest Bread Machine,"This is my 3rd bread machine; it was the least expensive and the best. It is a wonder; it make a perfect loaf of 100% whole wheat bread every time, I use organic golden grain wheat that I grind fresh for every loaf. Pauline M. Adamson, Red Lodge, Montana"
2,Nothing Good,"We don't like how our loaves are turning out. We are amateur automatic bread makers and took everyone's advice on measuring exactly and following instructions exactly - blah,blah - but our 4th loaf looks the same as our 1st. We'll keep trying & let you know if we can make it work better. If not, it will be a nice addition to our storage unit until we find somebody to adopt it."
2,Want something of poor quality?,"Well, I bought this machine and started making bread which I know how to do after owning a Zojirushi. The machine clacked and then ground down to a halt. I unplugged it and returned it. It was clear to me that the motor was of low quality as it could not handle the 1 and 1/2 pound loaf size. Not sure why there are so many good reviews on this. If you try this, make sure you note the return policy as you may need this."
2,Defective Unit,"My first experience with the Breadman Ultimate TR2200C was not a pleasant one. From the first time attempting to make bread I found that the product container would not stay securely seated in the unit. It continually kept popping up during the kneading cycle making it impossible to walk away from the unit. Also during the kneading cycle, when the dough formed a ball, the unit would bog down and stop repeatedly. I only used the oven cycle once during a dry run as suggested in the owners manual. I used the dough making cycle 4 times and the problem above continued and appeared to get worse. Then while sliding the unit back under my cabinets on the counter after use, the unit beeped and went electrically dead. After that it would not work in any electric outlet. I am presently in the process of replacing this unit for another one. I will then write another review after trying a second unit assuming that the first one was defective."
1,excellent- WHEN it works,"i am losing count, but so far i have ordered 2-3 of these through costco. luckily so, because then i know someone stands behind the product, somewhat. but what a headache. the first unit worked for a week and then totally failed to power up. the second worked ONCE and then failed to turn the paddle, though it did power up. Costco said that the manufacturer didn't want to send me another because they think that maybe it is a UPS problem with how they handle them. and i had called the tech support to make sure it wasn't something i was doing wrong. anyway, costco said maybe ordering from amazon would be better because of direct shipping method, but i am afraid to get one that works for a few weeks and then have to send it back and possibly not get credit."
5,Let's make bread! At 2 am!,"My friend owns one of these nifty machines, and it is great for midnight bridge marathons.:) We meet at his house at 10 or so, select a game or two to play (usually bridge, or Cranium) and start up the Breadman. In a few hours we're all munching on homemade bread! Yum! The Breadman isn't just for moms, but also works for feeding your college buddies at hours when most sane people are asleep. It's a fantastic machine!"
3,Help me find a better breadmaker,"I am on my second Breadman machine. I use it every day. The problem I have is: the pans wear out. I went through three pans with my first machine. Now the pan on my second machine is leaking. It is expensive to keep buying replacement pans from the company. So I am wondering if there is a better brand of machine. The Breadman is not cheap, but I purchased it because it seemed to have good ratings. Now I wonder if I should try another brand. As I said, I make a loaf almost every day of the year, so I need a machine that will hold up over the long haul. I don't need a lot of fancy cycles like the Breadman. I only use the whole wheat loaf cycle with the over-night delay and the dough cycle for pizza dough or rolls.Suggestions welcome."
3,Love it - Hate it!,I'm spoiled by the Breadman's capabilities. I'm dissapointed by the quality of the bread pan! Unit is only 90 days old and the rivits that hold the mechanism to the machine have come loose causing the bread pan to leak.While I can understand mechanical failure I cannot understand the difficulty I'm haveing replacing the bread pan. Neither the Chef's Catalog or Salton (the manufacturer) will help. See the other review here with similar difficulty
2,buy extra parts,"I love the machine except for the fact that after only 4 times using it to make wheat bread, the mixing tool is really loose on the shaft. you can turn the shaft back and forth a quarter turn before the mixing tool even moves. other than that issue, i like it.shaun"
5,A great bread machine!,"Breadman really makes a great product. I should know since this is the third Breadman I've had. The first two are still in use and being enjoyed by their new owners. I used each machine a lot (1 or more loaves a week for years) but eventually decided to step up to a newer model. This new one is really great.I don't think the product description really does this product justice. For me there are a lot of improvements in this machine that weren't available when I bought my last Breadman 6 or 7 years ago. In addition to making a horizontal loaf this machine has many other great features such as: a hopper for dispensing nut or raisins (not just a beep to let you know it is time to add them), a pause button, power failure backup, bake only cycle, and the ability to program 5 custom bread cycles. The price is great too."
3,Beware,My bread hook (the small part on the pan) broke and the company no longer has these parts available so the maker is basically useless. I'm pretty disappointed.
2,Breadman Machine,"This machine makes wonderful bread,but i need muscules to get the bread out of the pan.No matter how i tried i had to have my husband remove it for me.then the spring on the pan wouldn't allow me to lift the pan out of the machine.I will never buy another breadman."
5,I LOVE This Machine!,"I owned and liked a more basic Breadman machine. But I'd been wanting a better model, and my husband got me this one for my birthday. I like the fact that it makes a more *traditional* horizontal loaf. I also like that if the power temporarily goes off (such as cats pulling the plug from the wall...LOL), you don't have to throw out the dough and start over...it will pick up where it left off!I bake several loaves per week, and have not had one go wrong yet! It makes me waht to bake even more!"
4,Overall this is a pretty good machine,"I am sitting here smelling my honey banana whole wheat bread as I type. LOL This machine works well and makes delicious bread! I do set the crust to ""light"" so that it doesnt get so hard on the outside. I also add a bit of whole wheat gluten and wheat germ and it seems to help on the whole wheat/grains issue. I too prefer whole wheat breads but the first batch I did with JUST whole wheat flour (I replaced the ""bread flour"" suggestion) turned out very lumpy and did not mix very well. The paddle looked like it was having problems. If I add some wheat gluten though or a bit of bread flour, it really helps. I've only had it for a week so I need to play around a bit more with whole wheats and what not but so far I really like it."
2,dead after 2 years,"I used it twice a week, which makes about 120 breads. Second year machine was very loud, pan didn't stay well inside, had tendency of jumping out from position. Many times made beeping noise before start. Found way around it by selecting program instantly after powering machine on. Still a pain. Week ago bread pan fittings broke apart completelly, and because machine was completelly worn out... bought Zajorushi breadmaker as replacment, hoping it will live longer."
3,Too Loud,This machine is really really loud and noisy. We can't even hear the TV over it. It does make a decent loaf of bread though. If I were to buy another one I wouldn't pick this brand or model due to the noise.
5,Wonderful Purchase,I love it. It does everything that it was supposed to do. I've already made all sorts of breads with it. There is really nothing that smells better than fresh baked bread.
3,"Fine bread, unacceptably noisy.","This machine is versatile - it's almost completely programmable - and makes a fine product. Those who say it doesn't just don't know how to use it. However, don't plan to be in the same room with it for the 20-30 minutes it's kneading. The clank-clank-clanking and clattering will drive you nuts. I would call this a design defect; I have a Hitachi that makes no such noises. I'm surprised that Salton hasn't corrected the problem. It probably accounts for a lot of returns. Aside from the noise, it's a very good bread machine."
2,Overrated underperformer,"I have owned several bread machines and this one is simply not worth the money. The mixing system does not work well, so you always have to babysit it or risk having an uneven loaf that is wet in the middle with dry ingredients stuck in the corners.When I called the manufacturer to complain, they were completely unhelpful.The 110 preprogrammed settings are mostly useless."
1,Defective out of the box,"The mixing paddle failed to turn on first use. It turned out the drive belt was not connected. After connecting it, it worked for a few minutes before failing again. Upon further investigation, I discovered the cheap plastic drive pully was distorted and precessed while turning, so that the belt would jump off, usually after just a few turns. The cast aluminum housing at the base of the bread pan, and cotter pin holding it on, also rusted on first washing.Too many parts of this machine are made with inferior materials, rendering it a piece of junk."
1,"First Bread Machine Buyer Failed, Ohio","I have had this machine for 10 days. At first time, the bread didn't rise properly. I thought I wasn't following the instructions well and setting the timer too long. Today I try it again without setting the timer. The kneading cycle just doesn't knead anymore. (kneading paddle is in place, and I followed exactly the Milk Bread Recipe) I guess the machine is no longer functional.I decided to purchase this machine because of the name brand and good features. Now I am going to think about it again."
3,disappointed in replacement,"I bought the Breadman Ultimate TR2200C in March 2003. On October 31st, 7 months later, the gear that turns the paddle stripped and could not be fixed. I called the Salton and received a complimentary ups label via email to send the machine back for repair. I received my new breadman today (November 10th). The turn-around on the replacement machine was quick but it was NOT the same machine. I received the Breadman Pro TR900S. I did check the gear before using and it is sturdier. However, the TR900S lacks a lot of the features the Ultimate had eventhough it is 'pro'. If you have to send your product back be sure to ask what your repair/replacement options are! I am now stuck with a machine that costs more than the original one that bought but has fewer features. uggh"
3,Be careful,"Good machine, does what it says but support for this machine is poor. The paddle that comes with the machine broke within a few months after we bought the machine as far as we know there's no place to buy a replacment paddle. At this point we can't use our machine."
3,Breadman TR2200C - purchased 4/15/05,"The machine initially seemed to work fine. Then with each new attempt to bake bread the end product started looking worse and worse (center uncooked, bread not well formed, chunks of flour that never mixed....). After a while I decided to just turn the machine on and attempt to block the movement of the blade in the pan. Sure enough without even using force the blade wouldnt move. The force generated via the blade just wasnt enough to properly mix the dough. We returned the item (was still within the 1 year warranty period)after calling the customer svc phone number. The new machine arrived in a couple of weeks. It seems to work just fine and the blade movement has been powerful enough to bake good bread for the past month. So far so good!"
1,A machine not usable and customer service is not helping,"I have not been able to use my Breadman Ultimate Breadmaker as the paddle shipped was a incorrect, unfit part. I worked with the Salton customer service (Jeff C.) and he verified my Amazon receipt and promised to order a replacement part on 9/15. However, I didn't get any response to my follow-up since. It has been a very frustrating experience and I feel perhaps other people can use this precaution. 1) The fact that the manual cover page has instructions for customer with incorrect parts could be an indication that this happens quite often. To me, it tells me that the Breadman products may have a serious production problem, parts are often mispackaged. 2) Customer service level is not acceptable.It is a shame that this is supposed to be an excellent machine. I wrote to customer service asking for a return label to return the machine, and it has gotten no response either."
3,Not what I expected,"I was very excited when I bought this Breadman, however my bread was not what I expected. Despite measuring all the ingredients as instructed, and using the right ones, my bread came out odd-shaped, with a very light crust (although the setting was on dark), looking like dough. The inside was OK, but I was worried it wasn't cooked all the way through. Maybe there is a secret to it I still have to discover."
5,A Super Machine,"This is my third bread machine. Every so often I just upgrade to get all the newest features and gadgetry.And by far it is the best I have ever used. I LOVE THIS MACHINE! I wouldn't give it up for anything in the world.And to top it off, the recipes that come with it are wonderful."
1,shipped broken twice,Do not whatever you do order this product from Amazon.comThe first arrived with the door broken. The second had the plastic on the right side broken and a major dent in the metal.We tried to switch the order to the Panasonic but the email response bounced twice. I spent Saturday looking for a phone number but none exists. Look for yourself!!!! Except in Amazon complaints forums via Google.The second level manager hung up on me. No solution was offered other than waiting for a refund. He didn't even want to hear of changing the order.I've been hold with Amazon Corp to file a formal complaint for 45 min now I hope this helps in your decision.They have turned me from a advocate into a dissappointed customer in one week.
1,Do Not Buy This Bread Machine,"I received this Breadman as a Christmas gift from my husband. I was very excited about using the machine, but that enthusiasm was short-lived when after the first time I used the machine the bread did not set or rise. I tried three different recipes, with the same results each time - a knotted, hard, lump of inedible bread. I would rate this product with 0 stars if that were an option. I have had luck with Breadmans in the past. So, would recommend buying a different model."
5,Betty Crocker I Am Not...,"I recently had to cut sodium out of my diet. Since store bought bread has quite a bit of sodium in it, I thought I'd try and make my own bread, so I could control this factor. I have made several different types of bread (with no salt I might add) and they all taste great. Even a non-baker like myself can do this without much trouble."
1,Basic parts on not avaliable for repair.,"The manufacture of the product is actually Spectrum Brands. After getting a run around from the Parts department I wrote investor relations about the problems I had with the Breadman. I have not herd from them and will update the review if I ever do. Here is the problem. There is a large plastic gear in the under body that will deteriorate over time because of the heat. This gear is very easy to replace and you just need a Phillips screw drive and an adjustable wrench to replace it. The problem, they will not sell you the part, thereby making the product useless when, and not if, the plastic gear pulley begins to break apart. This is the only gear that drives the mixing blade, simple, but effective. Being made of a low grade plastic it will fall apart over time. I will add a video to show the damage soon. RECOMMENDATION: I would not recommend this unit since this product is not repairable,"
2,Lasted 1 and 1/2 years - now it's toast,"I bought this machine from Amazon exactly a year and a half ago. I enjoyed using it and enjoyed the bread that I made with it every week. But it was always very noisy - I soon found I could not set it to run overnight. It was too loud. I found that the 2lb loaf size was too tall for the toaster and made storage difficult, so I settled on the 1 1/2 lb loaf. These were flaws I could live with. But now the belt that runs the paddle pops off every minute or so during the kneading cycle. This happened to an older bread machine I had several years ago. I expected this machine to last a lot longer, especially since it had such great reviews."
2,dead after 2 years of use,"I used it twice a week, which makes about 120 breads. Second year machine was very loud, pan didn't stay well inside, had tendency of jumping out from position. Many times made beeping noise before start. Found way around it by selecting program instantly after powering machine on. Still a pain. Week ago bread pan fittings broke apart completelly, and because machine was completelly worn out... bought Zajorushi breadmaker as replacment. Hope it will live longer"
4,My review of TR2200C,"I purchased this breadmaker about 2 weeks ago to make whole wheat products exclusively. I tried to make whole wheat products with my old westbend breadmaker, but couldn't get them to rise very well. I thought with all of the process control of the new breadmaker I would be able to make the whole wheat products rise better. After about 20 different modifications to the program I was still unable to make whole wheat bread rise very well. I was quite discouraged and after reading more reviews, I realized I was not alone. I read something about ambient temperature in the reviews and tried to raise ambient temperature. I used a heating pad under the oven, then wrapped the whole oven with towels throught the whole cycle. Results were great and now I can do no wrong with the cycles. I won't make the two pound batch anymore, it rises out of the pan and slices are too difficult for the toaster."
3,Great machine but a couple of flaws.,"I received this machine as a gift from my wish list, I wanted it because at the time it had received fairly great reviews from users. I have a couple of problems with it though.First the loaf pan was difficult to remove the first couple of times I used it. Secondly, one of the reviewers mentioned that it does not bake the top half of loaves that are larger than 1 lb. That is true. I made the zucchini bread recipe from their cookbook, the top half did not bake properly, I let it bake an additional 10-15 minutes, this ended up overcooking the bottom half of the loaf with no apparent progress on top. Also when I made the standard 2 lb white loaf, it didn't bake a small portion of it at at the top.Either way I still use it quite a bit to make doughs and it works great for the most part. I tend to stick to making more 1 lb loaves though. Still it does a great job otherwise. I use it several times a week."
1,Poor quality and service,"I bought this machine thinking it was a fairly good quality machine that had good features. I found that within a month the non-stick coating wore off of the pan despite being gently hand washed and not abused in any way. When I sent an email about it I received a rather rude reply saying it wasn't his department, he was sales, and I needed to send my email on to another email address. FOrwarding to that address twice got me no reply. I also found that the company making this is actually Salton which I had a bad experience with previously. I have since decided that this company no longer needs my business, and probably doesn't need yours either. Save your money for another brand, because breadman and toastmaster arent worth your time."
5,"Very good bread maker, Great price","I've made about 10 loaves so far and they've all come out perfect. Some tips:-Before using the machine for first time, run the machine empty to burn off any residue from manufacturing. It says to do this in the manual but I missed it.-If you don't want a big hole on the bottom of your loaf you can remove the paddle after its finished making the dough then put the dough back in. I usually do this now and haven't had any problems."
1,Two out of two did not work,Purchased the first one of these because of ratings on Amazon. It stopped kneading on the first loaf. Called Breadman and was told the machine was defective and to return it. Did this and ordered a second one ( I don't seem to learn very fast) The new one made one loaf of bread just fine. The second loaf would not knead. On both machines you could hear the motor running but the part that turns the paddle did not turn. I've had a Panosonic for about 8 or 9 years and it works fine. I may buy a new one of them. The Breadman machines were a birthday present for my mother-in-law.
4,Breadman Ultimate Fan,"Actually the machine itself would rate closer to 5. It makes great bread, has a powerful motor, and is quite versatile but does have a few flaws. The dispenser for fruit and nuts is a great idea but doesn't always work. When it does it throws the items not only into the pan but all over the bottom of the unit. I also found the information booklet and the video poor...Apparently the machine has been redesigned but they're still using an old booklet. It does not give adequate help with the customization features. You really have to figure them out on your own. Many more positive than negatives however."
1,Machine is broken after light use for three months!,"While I bought the machine in July, it was not used until October or November. It made outstanding bread. However now, January 14, 2004, it will not stop kneading. I am very, very disappointed in the quality of the machine."
1,Second Breadman Broken and No Way To Repair,"Breadman machines are the best until I have used them for a couple of months and then the basket wont keep where it has to be for the dough to be kneaded OR the rotating mixing blade doesnt work quite right OR something else happens. Then, try the help line because the manufacturer wont reply to emails and the website is useless for anything other than product promotion. On the help line, some person who could care less will tell you that there is no repair for any of the problems. My theory? PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE, a fine American manufacturing tradition.So disappointing."
1,Breadman = noise maker,We received the Breadman for Christmas and were surprised to find out how noisy it is. The kneading cycle amounts to 20 minutes of loud knocking sounds. One cannot sleep through this cycle and wake up to fresh bread. Perhaps all bread makers are this loud (in which case we'll stick to hand kneading). The dough was also insufficiently mixed together. Lots of dry pockets of flour. Stay away from this product!
2,Drive belt and drive of the pattles leave much to be desired,"When my wife was making jam, the cycle created a over boil, and quite a lot of the sticky mess was easily caught in the gear and drive section of the machine. On subsequent use the cheap drive belt broke. You can't get a belt replacement, hence the machine is compleatly useless. Unless I want to spend 65.00 for a non-warented unit, instead of about $3.50 for a belt."
1,Amazon horrors ... Breadman TR2200C Ultimate Bread Machine,Do not whatever you do order this product from Amazon.comThe first arrived with the door broken. The second had the plastic on the right side broken and a major dent in the metal.We tried to switch the order to the Panasonic but the email response bounced twice. I spent Saturday looking for a phone number but none exists. Look for yourself!!!! Except in Amazon complaints forums via Google.The second level manager hung up on me. No solution was offered other than waiting for a refund. He didn't even want to hear of changing the order.I've been hold with Amazon Corp to file a formal complaint for 45 min now I hope this helps in your decision.They have turned me from a advocate into a dissappointed customer in one week.
5,"Great product, great bread","This thing is amazing. Dump in the ingredients, push a few buttons, and about 3 hours later you have a delicious loaf of bread. Perfect every time."
3,Ultimate Bread Machine,"This machine claims to bake a horizontal loaf but it does not. It may be wider than some but not horizontal. In fact, the bread pan was exactly the same size and shape as in my orignal breadmaker that I had intended to replace so I returned the Ultimate Bread Machine without even having used it."
1,3 machines later and still NO bread,"Imagine a home with two accomplished cooks. Imagine the convenience of a bread maker. Imagine eight months and three replacement products later. Imagine a Catch-22 between the manufacturer (Salton) and Amazon denying responsibility to refund our money. Imagine our outrage. Imagine the smell of warm rosemary wheat bread with English butter on a lazy Sunday morning. Well, keep imagining... we've got the third in a series of defunct Salton Breadman Ultimate setting on our kitchen counter, useless to us as anything but a paperweight. Spend your $99 USD on cooking classes and enjoy the comfort that comes from proofing your own dough."
3,GOOD,"IT IS MY THIRD BREAD MACHINE AND SO FAR IT,S THE BEST ONE YET.THE ONLY THING I DONOT LIKE IS YOU HAVE TO SCRAPE THE SIDES AND CORNERS TO GET ALL OF DOUGH MIXED. OTHER THAN THAT IM WELL PLEASED WITH IT."
2,Not for crunchy multigrains,"I had a Panasonic breadmaker for years and used a popular breadmaker cookbook with it. When I got my new breadman I tried the same recipes and they didn't work. I make only really whole grain breads and they turn out dry and lumpy in the Breadman. My mother-in-law had the same problem with Breadman and now has a Zohirushi. My observations are 1) multigrain rise times must be programmed manually, 2) the Breadman lets the dough get drier than other breadmakers, and 3) the rise cycle is not heated which decreases the lift in heavy breads."
2,slipping belt,"I have had the same problems as others....the belt keeps coming off and the machine keep making a whirring sound....I finally got sick of taking the bottom off to put the belt back on...so left the bottom off.....I think the problem is the wheel doesn't have a solid rim around it....and that's how the belt comes off. I think it's time for a design change. My son made me a cardboard disc to put at the back of the wheel, larger than the wheel...it stops the belt from coming off...now it bakes wonderful bread...contact me for more information!!!"
4,A Reliable Machine,"My Breadman replaced my Zojirushi, which finally wore out after about 9 years of loyal service. The Breadman makes a smaller loaf, and I am still tinkering with recipes, but it has some nice advantages. It keeps kneading when you open the lid, so you can scrape down any stuck flour and make sure it mixes in. This also makes it possible to adjust the consistency of the dough (part of the learning curve). There are dozens of settings, and the instruction book is reasonably well written. No regrets here, except for having to tweak all my old Zojirushi recipes."
4,Great bread!,"I got this bread machine a couple weeks ago and have used it almost daily. Initially I was disappointed that all the recipes in the companion book (as well as Breadman's Healthy Bread cookbook) called for powdered milk because we do not use dairy products. However, I tried using non-dairy recipes from other cookbooks and had poor results. So I replaced the water and milk powder with soy milk (water and soy milk powder would work too) and have had wonderful results since. I recommend this machine and the cookbook."
3,Leaking Problem,"We just experienced the same leaking problem as the other review. I couldn't even find a replacement pan. So we are buying a Zojirushi too. But, the previous two years it worked like a champ."
1,Disappointed,"Frustrated with bread machine because it couldn't handle whole wheat recipes with molasses.Also, extremely noisy and I now have to return this as the side clamps do not hold pan in place during knead cycles. Metal pan pops up out of clamps and bangs around, unconnected to motor. No longer can make bread because of defective clamps."
1,Decomposing Pan - black streaks in dough,"I have had this machine for three years. I use it only to make dough. After a few months I could no longer get the blade out to clean, and Salton told me not to bother. Well, about 6 weeks ago I started to notice black streaks in the dough. Today I handed the pan over to my husband and told him to take it apart, no matter what. He got the blade off and found that the washer in the pan had decomposed and was a sludgely black mess that leaked into the dough. Ugh. Salton says to replace the pan and blade for $50. Hm..............."
1,Dead in six months,"Six months after we bought the Breadman and had been using it with great satisfaction about twice a week, it died while baking. Because it was still under warranty, we are sending it back to Salton."
1,Piece of JUNK,"I owned a West Bend for many years and always got a good loaf of bread, howerver the bearing went out and I was told a replacement was no longer available. I purhased the Breadman TR2200C I tried 6 times to get a satisfactory loaf of bread and finally got one with my old receipt from the West Bend. The next loaf didn't make it as something broke and the paddle would not turn. I returned it for a replacement and got it yesterday. Today I tried to make a loaf and it came out terrible. THIS is definately a very poor quality unit. I would return it but the penalty to me is too great. DON'T buy one, get a different brand."
5,Excellent breadmaker,"I have this machine for 2 months now and I am absolutely happy with it. It makes perfect bread, very easy to operate, even more easier to clean. I have not used Jam option so far, but breadmaking features are satisfactory. Very quiet (even during kneading cycle), no excessive smell.We even gave the same model to our friends as a gift and they like it too.So I would recommend it."
3,"Great Bread, Dough Sticks to the Side, and the Pan Stuck","Pro: Easy to use; bread comes out great. Reasonable price.Con: Paddle stop spinning during kneading cycle; During kneading there is alway some dough stick to upper part of the side of the pan. Pan not straight after a couple of bakings and got stuck.Experience: I sent the first one back after the kneading paddle stop spinning; the second one the pan is stuck, I called up breadman's customer service; she told me to push the side metal flops. It's not an easy job - it took two people to do it because you need 4 hands. Then the next time after a baking, it got stuck again. I am not sure if I want to keep this one. If you are thinking of purchasing one, you need a lot of luck to get one that works smoothly."
2,25 Hymns Kids Love to Sing,"I bought this to hear the children sing, but I was disapointed because the musicans overwhelmed the voices."
4,Beltronics Express 935 Radar and Laser Detector,Picks up police radar within about 2 miles. Good value for the money.
5,"A classic, useful reference","There are other good texts out there less than 40 years old, but this in my opinion belongs along with them on the serious engineer's office shelf along with Gradshteyn & Rhyzik and the others.Note: The text is actually taken from the 1972 10th edition, plus some corrections Dover made."
4,Once Great,"I probably would never have gotten my PhD without this book, and it is a stupendous classic. Nowdays, though, my first resort is always Maple or Mathematica, with their manifold capabilities. I still find it useful for trying to understand what those programs are doing by way of simplification (or, more commonly, not doing). Eventually Maple and Mathematica will figure out that they need to couple a powerful explanatory capability to their marvelous algorithms, and this book will become truly obsolete - but that date is not yet here as of 2004.Four stars only because it has been partly overcome by history. 5 Plus for its historical importance."
5,"A & S is one of the true ""MUST HAVES""","A & S's Handbook of Mathematical Functions is an absolute must have for any lover of mathematics. The explanations are top rate. With the abilities of computers to tabulate numbers rapidly, the value of the tables is questionable. But the mathematical coverage is absolutely without equal. Any function you can think of, and some that you probably can't are covered in steamy, lurid detail. The paperback is such a great value that it makes me whinge to imagine that any lover of mathematics could possibly pass it by."
5,Useful and beyond,"Let's just say this. I've been teaching for 10 years. I have an outstanding professional dev. library at my school, and I wanted my own copy of this book. It's that useful. You won't want to just read it. It's a book you can use again and again."
2,disappointed,"I was excited to order this book, but once I received it, it had all the same ideas that all the other books have about learning centers, just presented in a slightly different way. I was very disappointed in my purchase and would not recommend it if you have already have experience with centers."
4,"Seminal Contract Treatise, But Probably Not For A 1L","This is a great hornbook, and as you probably know the seminal contracts treatise. That being said, this is an old book. The edition is from 1982, and Arthur Corbin died in 1967. The fundamentals of this book are strong but I worry that, for newer law students, this book is going to be a little inaccessible. On top of that, it won't have many of the modern developments in contract law. It is still a great book for students and practitioners both, but if you are a first year law student I think that you would be better off getting one of the newer contract treatises, or even the examples and explanations book on contracts."
3,The unnatural act of management,"Required reading for a Master's class that I am taking. Despite being written quite some time ago, offers some insightful ideas about management modern day."
1,Don't buy it for your Mac,"I had the same experience as the previous reviewer. The game only works for handheld devices, a fact which is not stated in the Amazon listing. Buyer beware!"
4,Thank you,"Ok. This year I finally tackled my long standing goal of completing a triathlon! I bought this book with the hope that it would make some of the scarier parts of it less scary. It really helped me. Even though I sometimes trained with a coached group, there were lots of things I was too embarrassed to ask anyone about because they seemed simple. That's where this book came in handy. I would just go to the book and look up my question. It was a comfort, and also probably saved me some embarrassment. The best part for me was the information about equipment. There is so much equipment out there for triathletes! It was overwhelming, but the book really helped me sort through what was necessary (I'm on a budget) and what was a good deal. Thank you Christina Gandolfo!"
4,women's triathlon great buy,The book meet most of my expectations. I wish there was more on nutrition. Overall its a great book full of information on what to expect in training for a triathlon. Im glad I purchased the book.
1,just look at he's face.....,"dude isn't funny! wish i never wasted $15.99 on this dvd, i could've bought toilet paper, or anything else.if you want it, i'll send it to you free of charge....the look on he's face...says it all."
4,Skinny girls let Bruce Bruce hit it.,Bruce Bruce is a funny down to earth guy and he says some serious things at times that are real.
5,"He truly is ""stupid for real""","Bruce Bruce warns you from the jump that he has no sense and is ""stupid for real"". This comedy show is hilarious from beginning to end and is something that I have found never gets old. He is one of the most under-rated comics in the game right now .... despite that I hope that he keeps it up because he brings laughter to an entirely different level whenever I watch him perform."
1,LOSIN' IT,"WHEN I RECEIVED THE CD I WAS SO EXCITED TO OPEN IT AND WATCH IT, BUT WHEN I OPENED IT THERE WAS NO CD."
2,What a let down....,"If you are a Bruce Bruce fan...I would highly recommend that you do not pick this dvd up because you will turn in your Bruce Bruce card!! I love this dude but ""WOW""....this routine sucked!! Alot of the jokes were recycled.....he was not up on his game on this one....maybe he needs to gain weight again!!"
3,It was alright,"I'm a big fan of his, but this wasn't that good. He had some funny jokes, but it wasn't even close to being funny as his older material."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I've seen much better and funnier performances from Bruce Bruce. This one is NOT even close. Don't waste your money, wait for it in cable or some other venue, you'll be glad you did."
3,The title was right ! Losen' it,Bruce Bruce have lost weight and lost the jokes right only with it. I gave it a 3 because some joke was o.k but the most part I want my money back.
1,DO NOT BUY,"DO NOT BUY!! I bought this TV 14 mos ago. Went to turn on and NOTHING-DEAD. I have had NO support what so ever from Sylvania (SECRET: it really is not sylvania, it is FUNAI) FUNAI SUPPORT is HORRIBLE, reps and supervisor HANG UP on you... No repair shop wants to fix, they claim parts impossible to get. So, in one year, after I paid 700.00 this is going in the GARBAGE pile. Save yourself countless hours of agitation and phone calls...DO NOT BUY."
3,No CableCard Slot,"No comment on the quality because I returned it without plugging it it. This set was adversited on the site as having a CableCard slot for HDTV content without the need for a set top box or rabbit ears. It in fact does NOT have a CableCard slot. If you want this feature, buyer beware."
1,Let's at least use a concertina..,"As I write this, I am again listening to Bal Musette, Vol. II featuring Rene Ninforge. For the most part, it still sounds like Saturday night with Lawrence Welk, complete with polkas, ragtime and a tip-of-the-hat to Spike Jones. ""GLOWORM"",for pete's sake? Many of the selections were written by Rene Ninforge who also, I presume, is the featured accordianist and I wish him all the best in both areas. But,if his next CD is similar to this, the illustration should feature, not dancers in apache costumes, but rather in lederhosen and Alpine hats. Ah! The music has ended and my opinion remains unchanged; were it only possible to give it less than one star!"
3,"Cute, but Choking Hazard?","This toy is adorable, but when it arrived my mom pointed out to me that it has a number of small pieces attached by some string. If any of them detach from the toy, then they are definitely choking hazards. I was a little shocked that Amazon sold it as a baby toy without any mention of these small pieces.Otherwise, it's very cute, but I plan on using it more as decoration than as a toy my baby actually uses."
4,Pretty good,"I'm not really a fan of Harlequen novels, but this one was actually pretty good. It is labeled 'historical' but I'd probably call it more a 'period' piece. When I think of 'historical novel' I usually come away having learned something about the history or culture and a desire to google for more info. That wasn't really the case here. But the story itself was pretty good. Sure, the hero and heroine took and instant dislike to each other, there were complications along the way, and the ended up in love...but there was a lot of 'side' interest too, in the sisters, the former lovers, accidents, etc. Good character development. I'm not real likely to run out and look for another Harliquen, but this one was laying around, so I picked it up....and enjoyed it."
3,Not up to Nicole Jordan standard for me,This book was just ok for me. I've read alot of Nicole Jordan's books and this one just wasn't up to her usual standards so I was a little disappointed.
3,crepe maker,We got this crepe maker to replace one (made in the 70's that my mother had given us that made wonderful crepes) that no longer worked. I have to say it does an ok job but our old one did a much better job and I've taken to making them in a pan instead of using this crepe maker. I think the big problem is the pan gets too hot. If making crepes in a pan is not an option for you then this is the best crepe maker I have found.
1,Totally useless,"We bought this to make crepes for a student group at college. We tried it several times, but found that it didn't heat evenly,didn't cook well, and was very difficult to use."
2,Pointless gadget,"Though Maxim is a fine company, this particular gadget is completely pointless. It is far easier to make crepes in a traditional, low-edged, non-stick crepe griddle. This gadget does nothing except complicate the process."
1,broken on arrival,"My original order had this item and also a cast iron skillet in one box. Needless to say the butter warmer had one broken warmer. Amazon sent me a replacement box of two warmers. One of those was broken.I do NOT suggest ordering anything like this item. It could get broken being shipped to Amazon, or from Amazon to you, and YOU will be charged the returned shipping charge to Amazon."
3,laptop power adapter for computer,"The item works OK, but it is not as tight in the receiving outlet in the computer as it should be."
2,not a very good charger....,I got this charger in early 08 by the summer it no longer worked. I went to best buy and got an HP charger with a 1 year warranty. I trust it better.
3,Sweet little Benson story,"If you love Mapp and Lucia, you will love this short story by E.F. Benson.Very sweet and very much in his style."
2,Daisy's Aunt,I guess this was just not my type of reading material as I never could get into the plot. That is why there is a multitude of types of books to select from and I am sure there are many who will enjoy this book. I was just not one of them.
5,A clear explanation of what is currently known about aging,"Professor Clark has written a book that is detailed and accurate, and at the same time accessible to people untrained in molecular biology. If you are interested in increasing both the quality and the length of your life, read this book."
2,NOT for 520,"I'm still trying to figure out if there is a 520 cover!I ordered this one for pick-up at Circuit City, and (after 40 minutes of them trying to find the order) wound up with one that stated it was for the 540, NOT 520.We did try it on a 520 in store, but the fit was very poor: cover did not open all the way, hinges did not stay in slots causing cover to fall off.So either this is a very poor design, or this one is being marketed & sold for an item it was not intended for.I just hope there is a cover available, somewhere............"
4,Great game,I gave this to a friend for Christmas and he really loved it. It was well made and has a very big game board. He looked forward to using his own cars on it.
3,Good for a while,"I have purchased two of these cables within one year of each other. The idea of a retractable cable is great, but it just wasn't a very good quality cable. This cable stayed strictly in my car hooked up to a USB cigarette lighter charger thing, and both that I purchased wore out very quickly, one in 4 months and the second one in about 8. In both of them, the plastic part that plugs into the Zune actually just fell apart in my hands, and the bare wires were exposed and I was afraid of being shocked. If you want an inexpensive cable, this is definitely an option, but don't expect quality."
5,"Great price, quality and design.","This works great in my car. No more tangled wires. I'm pleased with the design, quality, shipping time and the value. No complaints."
3,Great Retaractable Cord,"Product exceeds my expectations and arrived in a timely fashion. Very happy with both shipment and service, along with a great product. I highly recommend this to all customers for a future purchase."
1,Puff piece by a writer with an interest in Amway's success,"This book is a standard inclusion in many Amway ""lit packs"" given out to new prospects. With this in mind, do you think Mr. Conn has an unbiased, evenhanded view of a company whose existence has helped him sell many hundreds of thousands of books? I think not. The book is thorough, and includes lots of background information about Amway and its founders, Rich DeVos and Jay Van Andel. But it may as well have been written on Amway stationery for all the objectivity it provides. Mr. Conn (an unfortunately ironic surname for the author of an Amway book) sure knows how to succeed in the publishing world...write a glowing review of this ""exciting business opportunity"" without discussing any of the cautions new distributors or prospects need to know. This book gets only one star because Amazon.com doesn't go as low as zero."
4,Serpents and spirals,"Jeremy Narby has written a truly engaging account of his experiences with the ayahuasqueros, and with himself. He decides to be honest both with himself and with his readers, something terribly lacking in the world of science. As a trained scientist myself, I understand the leap of faith he took when deciding to get subjective with his research. We are trained to measure, not use our intuition. His own journey into the related discipline of biological chemistry makes his ""subjective"" analysis all the more valid. A must read for anyone open to new ideas about our existence."
4,Intriguing,"Are there other roads to knowledge other than reason? It would appear that ayahuasca using shamans ascertain information by accessing imaginal (not imaginary) worlds. This is what they claim and it is hard to explain their vast and complicated understanding of herbal pharmacology in some other way. This was the point that this book impressed upon me.Also, it would appear that big pharmaceutical companies exploit these shamans by stealing their information and taking the credit and the profit for it.I cannot go so far as believing that the serpent visions are somehow projections of DNA. It is an interesting hypothesis though, and perhaps in the future science MAY confirm Narby's theory.Anyway, I have heard so many good things about the entheogen ayahuasca (from varied sources) that I would definitely like to try it in the future"
2,Just bad science,"I think it's amazing that an educated person could write something like this, and I would be amazed if any other educated person could read it and not laugh out loud. His narrative can be fun to read at times, yes. But he has completely abandoned everything he SHOULD have learned about the scientific method. He systematically confuses anecdotes and visual similarity with real evidence. If you can call what he is presenting a hypothesis, he doesn't present a control experiment or any way to disprove it.I think the fact that this book actually came from somebody with a PhD is shameful--he is contributing to the idea that science is just a Western fad and just another belief system.If you are the kind of person who buys dream catchers, crystals, and magic pyramids, then you will probably love this book. I suggest that if you love this book, you read ""The Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark"" by Carl Sagan and pay attention."
4,A big piece of the big puzzle.,This book is one of those books that change the way you look at life and the world.There is so much knowledge about the orgin of life that's disregarded by western science just because they don't understand it. Knowledge that comes from worlds that western science just doesn't grab.This book is an excellent read for open minded people. Well and conservative narrow minded scientists too. But they will probably disregard it :)
5,Read this book and then look at the world again......,"I received this book as a birthday present. Now that I have finished it, I realize the true value of the gift.Jeremy's concise handling of the issues surrounding the subject of ""native shamanic knowledge"" versus ""modern scientific knowledge"" is eye-openning to say the least. He embarks on a rollercoaster journey of discovery that, just like a coaster, starts out slow and picks up speed as it goes. I had a great deal of trouble putting this book down and once I did, the world looked different somehow."
5,What is reality? Amazonian shamans know more than us!,"In a radical step away from traditional anthropology, Jeremy Narby takes Amazonian shamans at their word when they credit knowledge of complex plant recipes such as curare to ingestion of ayahuasca. After his own eye opening ayahuasca excursion, he methodically explores striking new concepts that question the very nature of reality and the origin of life itself. Fascinating mix of science, anthropology, and millenial musings."
2,"Poorly written, tedious.","I'm surprised that no one before me has mentioned how poorly written this book is. It sounds like it was written by an eighth grader with no imagination. For somone who is discussing hallucinations, he would have done well to have been more colorul in his writing. It reads like a technical brochure. Half the things he talks about are of no consequence to the point he's trying to make."
1,Not good.,"I will be brief. The book has no scientific or logical foundation. I will not bother to denegrate shamanism, but would say that while avoiding Western-centrist thinking may be meritorious, abandoning logic and sound evidence does the argument no service. The author's professional identification crisis is amusing, and his abandonment of methodology makes this a good read for ""Visionary Shamanic Trance"" and ""Chills & Thrills"" (see reviews/personal testimonials below). I have to think that your average English major with a leaning toward mysticism will think this book ""far out,"" while any person who is serious about science and/or logic will only be seriously annoyed"
1,"Pedantic, overstated science fiction","I am a fan of naturalist books and theory ala Steven Jay Gould, Charles Darwin, etc. I have also read anthro-fiction like Carlos Castaneda and his gang (Donner etc.) and I was so surprised by the lack of true knowledge of things scientific in this book. If we are to make the leap that Narby asks us to, in a scientific sense, then he should present more thorough and well thought out arguments. If he wamts us to make a leap of faith then allow us. Do not preach science, science is not a pulpit from which to preach, it is merely an accumumlation of empiric evidence that points one in a certain direction. This book was balderdash. I sure hope it wasn't his PhD thesis...back to the drawing board"
1,The Cosmic Serpent,"The first couple of chapters were very interesting, more like a novel. As I got into the middle of the book it was like reading a science textbook. There is obviously a lot of discussion of DNA and how the author tries to relate it to the Amazon medicine men."
2,Modern Mythology,"Apparently countless civilizations have recognized the serpent or other double-helix like shapes as of primal importance, and consumption of hallucogenic drugs induces similar visions. Narby has taken this information and declared that humans are, and always have been, somehow aware of the DNA that underlies our existence. He also believes that DNA has intentions, can communicate with us, and it not of this world (he does not believe in natural selection, etc). As a geneticist with an interest in neurobiology and consciousness myself, I am aware that he has butchered much of the science he presents (for example, claiming that the circularity of natural selection makes it untestable). However he writes well, and I enjoyed reading about the anthropology (which appears well documented to my admittedly inexpert eye) that led him to derive this new mythology. I certainly don't agree with his conclusions, but I appreciate his intellectual creativity and sense of discovery."
5,My son loves it!,"My little boy is really getting into the monster trucks. He loves monster mutt, and loves watching them on TV. This is a great toy and very durable. Just like the one on Monster Jam, but he is missing the tail LOL."
5,Absolutely perfect for the price,"I'll be short. If you're simply looking for a good cup of coffee and you're not concerned about timer's brewing cycles and other features found in other brands this is your coffee maker.To give you an example I accidently ordered a more expensive Krups at the same time that I ordered this one. So my wife and I decided to try both and send back the one that didn't perform as well.To my surpise the Melitta made a much better cup of coffee. The coffee was hotter, richer, more flavorful, I mean you could really taste the aspects of the coffee bean better. Don't get me wrong the Krups was good and had more features but I'm all about the taste of my coffee.Definitely a good buy at a good price I couldn't be happier"
2,cheapest made coffeemaker,"It makes a decent cup of coffee, but the funnel swings open on weak hinges that break very easily which mine did. In addition there is no ""on"" light to indicate the machine is on. Would you believe MELITA was too cheap to put a bulb in the on switch and painted it RED to indicate the coffeemaker was ON."
4,Keeps going,"I have had this coffeemaker for almost a year now. That may not seem all that long, but in the days of disposible products I am happy to say it is still going strong. It keeps the coffee warm if not tongue burningly hot.Biggest downside is that the cone is a bit tricky to get in and out. With a bit of practice -- it get's easier.For a simple, inexpensive coffeemaker it is a good value -- especially if you need a black model to match your decor [smile]."
1,Sorely Lacking,"This guide barely scratches the surface, of this game. The only thing it's really good for is just giving you the basics for each level. However, it does not cover all the variations of each level, nor does it give you any insight into how to locate the extras in each level, how to unlock each plane, or how to achieve S rankings on each level."
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed with the rose pruner especially considering the cost of it. It is not effective at cutting anything but the smallest of branches and does not look like it will hold up to long term use. I wish I had returned it.
5,This is a great C.D,"I have been a sister sledge fan... since i was a kid.This is a very mature sound from them.Great vocal's ....and a jazzy feel to it.I think it is one of their best.One thing is missing....Kathy is no longer with the group.But Joni,debbie,and kim...have made a excellent C.D."
3,African Eyes,"I bought this CD because my cousin is in it. The music is okay but Sister Sledge was never a favorite of mine. If you like her music, buy it. I'll say this, the music isn't half bad. Actually, I'm starting to like the album."
4,Well put together DVD,"I've become a Something Weird fan.I've seen the extra features and I liked them.I've watched BB&B; and it was interesting enough. I'll get around to BLD later.I only have one serious complaint with the first feature. I know this is an older film and the nudity is a funny thing. There is a ton of toplessness. There are lots of backside views.I don't mind the lack of full frontal nudity, but this film went to agonizing extremes to avoid it. The actresses are fully nude and the lengths they went to in order to avoid a crotch shot really stressed me out."
2,Very very different sound for Growing,"If you are a fan of the organic drone of Growing, be aware that this album is NOT that sound. This is more like some glitchy, fragmented, skipping-disc version of Growing. The sound is mostly electronic and not at all fluid like most of their catalog. I love Growing and own almost all of their recorded output, but this one does very very little for me.If you are a first time listener, grab yourself Soul of the Rainbow or Sky's Run Into The Sea."
2,Cap shipped vs. Cap shown.,Please do some research. Your product does not fit the foto you are selling. See my cap's differences in color and quality.
5,on par with Abstenia,"Neither CD is perfect, but each has 5 great songs and only one from each that might be filler.I made a tape of my favorite five including the spectacular Arriving Somewhere Not Here. A year later, I was riding my bike in the mountains listing to another tape I'd made and at the end heard a faint ghost of a song that I'd previously erased. Even at just a whisper, I played it several times and had to find out what I'd erased. Looking through my CDs it dawned on me that the song was Lazarus. Flowing beauty between much harder rifts."
3,"A Consolidation, Not a Stretch","Most Americans heard of Porcupine Tree with the release of 2002's In Absentia, and had a lot of catching up to do. Unapologetically progressive, it was obvious that Steve Wilson's musical collective grew up on Yes and Floyd and Tull and Genesis. Yet this being the new millennium, they were also familiar with Metallica-sized riffs and System of a Down-esoterica. Since prog is the new punk, Porcupine Tree are now seen as harbingers. Deadwing, their tenth (I think) studio release, is a consolidation not a stretch. The heaviest numbers are the most concise, especially the one-two punch of ""Shallow"" and ""Halo"". Elsewhere, they jam, particularly well on the opening title track. They're superb at it, they are, but they aren't Zeppelin, and they remind me of a wonderful (and obscure) progressive outfit from the late 70's called Crack the Sky, whom I have to admit I'd rather listen to."
4,Still another great album,"I have already written in other reviews for Porcupine Tree that every album is a unique expression of psychedelic rock- metal - rpogressive rock with very very good sound - production which gives a perfect result. Every album is perfect and there is no exception to this one. Its a little bit darker than other records and a little bit stranger. You have to give it a little tries before you can like it, but it worths the time. Keep it up Porcupine."
2,Major Disappointment,"I couldn't wait for ""Deadwing"" because I believe ""In Absentia"" is absolutely amazing. I can't stop listening to it - even popped it in this morning. The drums are stunning. But I believe ""Deadwing"" is appropriately named. And PT must have a new drummer, because they're now very weak - at best. I can't think of a single track that's worth mentioning - maybe Shallow. But even that is shallow."
2,Boring and Pretentious,"This is the type of prog-rock that I find extremely boring and pretentious. The singer is average at best and the pace of the album is rather plodding. If you want to hear some creative prog-rock, try Spock's Beard or Umphrey's McGee instead."
5,Outstanding,"I've come to know PT only over the last year. What a joy! Actually their last two albums-In Absentia and Deadwing are clearly the best, with selected songs from older work also excellent (Evenless, Dissapear). The best band I've heard in over five years."
4,"In Absentia, only better","I can't say much more than what people have already said. The first half of the album takes a lot of getting used to if you like traditional rock songs. But it twists into your psyche if you let it. The angular verse melody of the title track is so atypical of anything being done, and yet it has a powerful hook of its own. ""Lazarus"" is gorgeous and unforgettable. ""Halo"" is catchy; even the distorted spoken part is a hook of its own! ""Arriving Somewhere But Not Here"" is a brilliant epic, with somber lyrics, intense, gripping chord changes, and a head-melting rock section that will pulverize every bit of your soul. It does peter out around ""Open Car,"" and I'm not fond of ""Start of Something Beatiful"" but ""Glass Arm Shattered"" does end the album nicely in a sort of faux-Beck way.I recommend it to anyone starting with PT. It's the Radiofloyd sound with heavy rock infused. And let it sink. That's the way it works best."
5,hypnotic,"I have become a recent convert to Porcupine Tree. A musician friend turned me on to them a couple years ago and sent me the In Absentia cd.Always have been a big prog guy (King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Gentle giant etc) and discovered Spocks beard, Flower Kings and other more recent prog bands within the last 10 yrs.Porcupine Tree is a band that has a totally unique sound and truly gifted song writing. If you like bands that stand on their own such as early Genesis and King Crimson you should appreciate this.Their music can be somewhat dark and moody and then shift to the most beautiful melody you've ever heard. Kind of a signature thing with them.Gives you the shivers!!Check them out. One of the true innovaters in modern music!"
5,BEST KEPT SECRET of modern rock!!!!!,"This is perhaps the greatest unknown band of our time. Apparently bareknown here in the US this band has finally started to get the exposure they deserve. If you like Pink Floyd, Coldplay, Radiohead or even STP... you certainly will like this gem. Buy this and Absentia... then try Stupid Dream.... you won't be sorry."
3,PT De Los Average,"All-in-all a somewhat boring release by PT. PT is one of my favorite bands and contrary to other reviewers, I don't think it is anything like In Absentia.....in fact, it feels more like some of the more weaker releases from ""up the downstairs"" or signify"" era, but with more up-to-date guitar distortion. Beautiful melody is generally lacking and replaced with dry, brooding jams. Even though I rated it average, I am rating against the 'PT standard'.....so Deadwing is worthy of attention over most music out there."
3,Little dead weight,"3 1/2Although it becomes a little less noticeable as it goes on, Deadwing is still a good example at the solidly accessible rock-prog output PT put out under modest assumption."
3,Where did he got lost,"About that title, this may be a little too strong. By the time of signify, what happened. Steven Wilson... I don't know no more about PT now. Anyway..This year, Blackfield totally got me ! hundred times better."
2,"Not bad, but bad","From one side, it is not bad. The production, sound, playing are amazing. On the other hand, probably the worst PTree album up to date, dull and lacking really good melodies.You can easily confuse the title track with any track on Opeth's Damnation, while Lazarus seems to be Robbie Williams' song.I love all PTree albums, including Metanoia, except Deadwing. Commerce and mainstream are killing Steven Wilson."
2,Disappointing...,"I was so excited to hear about the new album and even more so when I actually picked up a copy. Unfortunately, I was so disappointed. I tried to be fair and gave it a long time thinking that maybe at some point it would sink in and I would start loving it. Not the case. The more I listened, the less I thought of the album. Immature heavy riffs and plain silly lyrics... I just felt that very little effort was made on this album.Secondly, I do not understand people that group this album with In Absentia! They are so distinct! In Absentia is full of pure ""Wilsonism"", strange ideas and fusions of various styles and heart felt music. Nothing like Deadwing.I guess it depends. I fell in love with Porcupine Tree because of Lightbulb Sun, Stupid Dream, and Recordings. This album just does not compare."
2,Bleah!,"Every water gun I've gotten leaks shortly after buying it, if not right off the bat. These are no exception."
5,awesome cd,Kloud 9 is awesome. Awesome vocally. Awesome songs. Id go out & buy this cd right away. I give this cd 10 stars.
1,Can't judge a book by its cover? With this one you can.,"Look at this cover. What's the deal with the old VFW dude wearing shorts that are way to short for him, hanging out with some other closeted idiots, while some washed up waitress looking chick (presumably trying to look interested and sexy) stares on? It's a total joke, and looks as if some fool snapped it up at a local Starbuck's, or, probably more realistic, visiting hours at a nursing home.Then you get inside the book itself. Kind of like a geeky junior high kid's version of Dale Carnegie's book if you ask me. You didn't, but I told you anyway. It's a complete and total travesty and those people who are, in any way, lead by this treatise need to seriously get out of the house more and develop some taste (as well as social skills).Avoid. Completely."
2,very dissatisfied,I have a tr444 that I used about 12 times and really loved it because it was easy. Just add the ingredients and turn it on. Then a plastic part that the belt wraps around that is connected to the motor broke into 3 peices. The machine is unusable. The service department cannot get new parts and cannot service the item because it is made in China. I have found nowhere to find new parts - they are not sold anywhere. The service department was no help at all and the warranty is useless.
1,It won't last,"We are having the same problem I'm reading in many of the other reviews. This is only a few months old now but the belt in the machine is really starting to slip (can hear the crunching sound all over the house). We've tried adding liquid to make the dough ball a bit softer, but it just makes for dough that is too wet. I don't expect this one to last much longer."
1,breadman TR444,"I do not recommand this breadman model at all. I followed their recipe for 2 pound white bread, and it didn't even mix all the ingredient. I made 1 pound bread which was succesful. I am returning this product, and try something else."
3,Feeling lucky?,"I had reasonably good luck with this model; I think it lasted about 2 years -- which, for the price, is pretty good. However, even when it was working well, it did not easily handle heavy whole wheat breads."
1,Probably the worst breadmachine made,"This breadmachine will NOT cook a loaf of bread that is satisfactory. Even on the lightest setting, the crust is overcooked. It would be much better to spend less and get one elsewhere."
1,worst ever,"bought this bread machine for my wife w/in 4 months the bread just stop rising not that it was perfect before. all the features that are suppose to make a delicious loaf of bread and all we get was mush . we tried numerous brands ,from scratch to top mixes still the same.reccommend a different unit or even brand"
1,Need a replacement pan,"After about a year of use (about 20 loaves), the non-stick surface of my breadpan has worn off and the loaves will not come out of the pan. I found a replacement pan at www.culinaryparts.com for $41.00, but after reading all of the reviews about the unreliability of this machine, I am reluctant to make the investment."
5,Really cute board book!,I bought this sight unseen for my nephew and I love the cute story and illustrations. I plan on adding this one to my library as well!
5,Favorite Bedtime book for 6month old (now 11mos),"At first my daughter and I were not big fans of this book. It took me a few readings to learn how to incorporate my daughter's favorite sounds -- animal sounds and ""clapping"" to the clip-clop sounds. But now, my daughter LOVES this book! She cries when we get to the end of the book and I usually end up reading it to her more than once. The repetition is great in that she is learning to identify each of the five animals in the book. Sounds such as ""plop-plop"" are music to baby's ears. Highly recommend it."
3,Format misrepresented,"This is NOT a hardback - it is a board book - should have checked the dimensions. Wanted the larger format of a hardback - board book option is cheaper so order it as a board book to save money. Hardback option is more expensive but you get a board book anyway. Delightful story and illustrations, but the wrong size and format."
5,old-fashioned goodness,This book is wonderful! It is refreshing for a book to have characters with nice manners! The illustrations are uncluttered and simple. The story is also simple yet sweet and even has an element of thrill and suspense! I would highly recommend this book for infants and toddlers!
5,Wonderful build up to the climax,"This is a wonderful book based on the emotion of many childhood excitements; wanting more and more, building up to a climax that's a little scary, but extremely exciting! This emotion is illustrated in a lovely, simple 'story' of a horse and his animal friends. A great book for toddlers, with cute illustrations, to read over and over again!"
5,Interesting,"Aaron Burr, the most misunderstood and complex of our founding fathers, is depicted in this book quite uniquely. Unlike Vidal's book, which too is interesting, this one doesn't victimize Burr, but tells it like it is. It suggests that there is a conspiracy outside Burr's conspiracy. A political frame-up from Jefferson himself to bring about the downfall of the Federalist Party. Trust me, if you're interested, this book in vital!"
3,Better Directions Please!,"I was ready to return this item because the cover would not stay up when I opened it. This made the Jornada worthless when it had the cover on. I decided to try it one last time, before I put the item back into the box to return it, and I noticed that if I pressed the connections between the Jornada and the cover when the cover was opened it locked into the open position. After a number of manuals locks the cover settled (I guess) into the connection slots and would lock open when I flipped the cover up. One would think that a company like HP might find it useful to their customers to include this information on how to make their product useful, but they didn't. I don't think it's worth the price, but without a third party option HP can (and will) get what they can."
2,Exciting in a Junior High Sort of Way,"If I'd read this book when I was in Junior High or even High School, I might have found it enthralling and a nice diversion..but as an adult who expects more, I can't recommend it.Characters are barely sketched out and then are forced to remain incredibily dumb until other characters explain all in lengthy exposition.The book had some ideas and a few moments but never really did anything with them."
3,Human clones; yes/no,"Another science-gone-mad book describes The Experiment. Skyler after living his entire life on an island escapes when his forbidden lover is killed. He makes his way to the city and finds a journalist who looks exactly like him. The plot is far fetched, but gives ample room for thought regarding the acceptability of cloning. As the story line moves along almost everyone in the book develops a look alike and as it moves to a climax, it becomes obvious that clones are being developed for spare parts."
2,A Dud,"An awkward thriller with no suspense. I suppose every journalist has a novel in him, which is an excellent place for it."
1,Disappointing,"Yet another disappointing tale of a bio-tech company catering to the wealthy by cloning replacement parts. Throw in a little bit of the impossible -- the technology existing for decades, and clones grown on an island off the US coast -- and you get this book.I do agree with the other review -- PLEASE finish a book before reviewing it!!!"
3,Just 3 Stars,"I dunno, maybe it's me. It was an interest premise but the book bogged down after the science was explained. It wasn't that the story got boring, it just slowed down. In my opinion, Darnton threw too many caveots at our heros. If he had cut some of the unnecessary fluff out of the story I would have given it another star. I think there were a few too many bumps in the road. The cave-in is a bit cliche anymore - of course our heroes would escape - there was 150 pages left! Neanderthal was much better."
4,What an experiment!,"Skyler is a test subject living on an island with other test subjects being attended by a physicians. Jude is a journalist in New York. He an Skyler could be twins, but they're not. Science has made a breakthrough and it is being used for evil purposes. Skyler and Jude unravel the bizarre and terrifying story and live to tell the tale."
2,"Read ""SPARES"" instead","For a far more solid approach to the controversial issues ofcloning and a stronger thriller read Michael Marshall Smith's""Spares"". John Darnton's books is so similar in many ways to ""Spares"" although ""Spares"" predates ""The Experiment"" by at least three years. The ideas and concept of ""The Experiment"" are admirable and it could be worthy of five stars but sadly, John Darnton's sluggish prose and lack of range lets the book down, which is a suprise after the excellent ""Neanderthal"". The idea of cloing is not a new one for techno/sci fi literature and with the hype surounding ""The Experiment and Wes Craven's novel ""The Fountain Society"" on the way it looks like the cloning genre is set to repeat itself again and again and again."
2,You gotta be kidding!,"It is amazing that there are writers who seem to think that it is no big deal for, say, two clones, separated since 'birth,"" to happen to meet each other in a country of 280 million people and become friends. Oh, did I say their girlfriends were also clones? Must run in the family! Then, in this whole country, they kinda find out where they were cloned, etc., bad guys after them, yawn, and so on.Lots of words, little action that makes any sense, tired theme, scientists are all evil, yada yada. 'Nuff said. Beware."
3,Could have been great...,"I found The Experiment to be ok, but given the subject matter, could have been much better researched. Something that disappointed me was the existence of some major timeline inconsistencies regarding one incident in particular ( if I mention it, it will ruin the book for you - so I won't ) ... let's just say that it is so fundamental that I had to put it out of my mind just so that I could finish the book. Took much of the credibility from the story and the author. Still, it was pretty good."
3,Interesting story but rushed ending,"As an identical twin, ""The Experiment"" seemed like a natural pick for me. It started out promising. The science is interesting and well-explained. Nevertheless, the book was ultimately unsatisfying, probably because the denouement seemed overly rushed."
4,Chilling summer read. . . .about cloning,"Skyler and Lizzie find out they are clones being kept and harvested for organs as some of their friends start disappearing. They escape and meet Jude, a reporter, who gets involved with the 2 and puts pieces of the puzzle of his past together to get the full scope of The Experiment. I think this book is very similar to the movie coming out this summer, ""The Island"" with Ewan MacGregor."
3,An interesting Premise,"The story was well written, matching the quality of ""Neanderthal"". The overall premise was interesting, but failed to support the story to the end. However, there was plenty of excitement and tension to keep me turning the pages. It's just that the amount of effort required to keep the experiment going to reach the ends (which was meant to justify this particular means)overreached what would logically be practical. I also realize that trying to rationalize thriller plots based on reality is a futile and ultimately lessens the reading experience, so I'll stop here. Suffice it to say that my wife read the book and thought it would make a good movie, so there is a certain appeal to this story."
3,Stretching in the end,"After first 50 pages, the book caught my imagination. And upto the next 200 pages, it continued its hold. But there wasn't a lot to say after that and the interest wades.One good thing about this book is that it doesn't judge too much the moral side of the scientists conducting this experiment. Rather it concentrates on the events and the scientific things in the field of genetics. (I read that the author was an award winning journalist. Perhaps thats why its more about facts first and sentiment next).Also the book kind of builds up for the ending while there isn't any big suspense revealing itself when we reach the last 100 or so pages.All in all, its a good book I would rate it 3 to 3.5 out of 5."
3,Good Science; Weak Plot,"The science was a fun read. Darnton researched it well. However, the plot was not credible in certain aspects, and the dialogue was Clive Cussler-esque and trite. Darnton's view of human nature is darkly incredible."
1,Just not very good,Hard to imagine anyone really likingthis book. It read like a bad TV show. Nothing creative at all in the plot or in the writing. Skip this one.
1,Just plain mediocre,"I received this book as a gift, and as a fan of Preston and Child, I was happy to try a new writer of science thrillers. In a word, the book was ""so-so."" The science was OK, but the story was so lacking in imagination that I found reading the book rather boring. Really."
1,It had hardly any plot and was confusing.,"Please don't read this book unless you want to spend 24 hours a day 7 days a week for the rest of your life trying to figure out who the bad guys are. I really didn't get this book and all, and I felt confused everytime the actual 'experiment' came up."
5,brilliant games by attacking genius,"leonid stein was a genius of attack who beat botvinnik, tal petrosian, smyslov, keres and a host of others. the games here are annotated very carefully and in highly readable form by the grandmaster correspondent of the london times and the international herald tribune. every game is a joy to play over. some people have claimed that some of the games are not by stein. this is simply untrue. every game is well authenticated and there will be some marvellous sacrificial treats very lucidly explained for anyone who buys the book. there is also a biography of stein with his most important results spelled out in detail.watch out for stein's immortal game against krogius!!"
5,My 2nd Toastmaster Bread Machine,"This is my SECOND Toastmaster Bread machine...and I didn't wear out the first one, I gave it away! My husband, who loves fresh bread, bought an earlier model when he realized I wanted a bread machine (guys, DON'T give appliances as gifts to your wives!) and gave it to me as a gift. AFTER I got over being angry, I was impressed with how much the the first model could do.When I saw this model, I looked at it, and realized it was better suited to my needs than the first -- so I have it now.... and a friend of mine is happy with the older model, which is still running strong, three years later!"
2,It burns everything,"I bought this as a replacement for my Oster bread machine, which I literally wore out.I'm not a fan of this machine. Evey loaf of bread I makes burns , even recipes that were tried and true in my old machine. And when I use the recipes in the instruction manual, there seems to be too much liquid or too little flour, because I never get a nice ball after the mixing cycle is over. It's always a loose gummy mess, no matter how carefully I measure.For the price, you can probably find a better machine."
1,Veteran Bread Machine User,"I was HIGHLY disappointed in this machine. I got this machine last October, had it for 2 months and it died after making horrible clunking noises for a week. I took it to the certified repair center who had it for a month and said they fixed it, but when I took it home to make pizza dough it died the same day. I was FURIOUS and shipped it back to the company. I will say I got very prompt service from them and had a new one (they couldn't fix mine) on my doorstep in 10 days from when I had sent it. I was happy until the new one started doing the SAME THING after 4 months of use. It just died 2 days ago. Needless to say I am looking for a different brand. To be fair I will say that I use my breadmaker 5-7x/week. However the Welbuilt machines I had previously took that kind of workload for 6 years without a problem. So Don't buy this machine unless you are only using it on a rare occassion!"
4,Toastmaster phone support is great.,"I was surprised to see a negative review here about Toastmaster support. When I got mine, I had a bit of trouble removing the pan the first time, and being afraid of damaging it, I called the support number and was helped by a very friendly and knowledgeable person. He told me to give it a good and careful but hard yank, and if it bent it, he'd send me another pan for free. Well, it came right out, and after baking a few loaves the tight fit loosened and is now fine. He also answered a number of my questions about using the machine. I was very impressed with all of this free help for a new customer.The only thing I don't like about my particular model, the Bread Box Plus TBR2, is the LCD is blurry and sometimes hard to read unless you view it at just the right angle. Other than that, it's a great appliance, and I bake at least twice a week. As with the microwave oven, I don't know how we ever lived without it."
5,The great Cellini speaks on art and life.,"An excellent guide to a wide range of metal working and sculptural techniques made all the more interesting by the dynamic and outspoken character of the author. The great Benvenuto Cellini is a proper model for all artists: be excellent, honor excellence in the work of others, and do not suffer fools to waste your time or disparage your work without answering them forcefully. Bravo Benvenuto!"
2,"Weak fiction, fails to hold reader interest","I think this is well intentioned fiction, but the problem is it's too bland. The characters, like the insectoid main character are lacking in drive. She (it?) just seems to fret a lot, worry and whine.Hey, this is a subjective review---as are all reviews. This series either floats your yacht or it doesn't. Just a word to the wise: don't believe all the raves about this series until you've read a few yourself.I like strong characters who are trying to DO something, achieve something. That's why I prefer writers like James Schmitz:Telzey Amberdon (Telzey Amberdon (Baen))"
4,Nice strap,I use this on my Canon G-12. Works great. Wraps around my wrist while on the trail and keeps the camera handy. Strap pops off easily when it's time for the camera to go into it's otter box.
4,Serves its purpose.,"Other than the slight fraying around the edges (cosmetic) it has performed well. There are times when a full strap (to free both hands) is still a better choice, but this strap has its advantages the other 99% of the time."
5,Great product,"Perfect for my Canon G12. Secure, comfortable, and fits nicely in my camera case. It does make your wrist a little sweaty on a hot day, but that's no big deal."
5,Good strap!,"Cómodo y versatil, cuenta con enganche que permite retirar con facilidad la correa si es necesario. El material es resistente y de buena calidad. Lo recomiendo!"
2,Very weak connection,"The neoprene piece connection into the plastic joint cracked at the first tug test I did with my hands to see if it would securely bare the weight of my NEX-5N. It did not give away completely, but I am certainly not confident that this would hold the camera if it slipped out of my hand.Although the loop and connection is of a good quality. but I would rate it to it's weakest point.Really disappointed."
4,Does The Deed Well!,"After trying several leather and nylon wrist straps on my Olympus E-P3, I was ready to pack it in and geek out with a neck strap. I tried leather CamAdapter and Olympus straps: they looked classy and were strong, but were stiff and awkward to use. The Olympus point & shoot nylon wrist strap worked great but was too light duty for a micro 4/3 camera. Finally I tried the Op/Tech: this neoprene beauty is soft, flexible, comfy and strong. Plus it's easy to quickly slide my hand through and has a plastic slide to tighten the strap for increased security. I wish it used a standard 1/2 inch nylon strap to connect to the strap lug on my E-P3, but the thin nylon ""loop"" connector seems strong enough. The quick release is redundant for a simple loop connector as it's already easy to remove. Lose the quick release and add a standard 1/2 strap/buckle connector and this product would be a perfect 5."
1,Neoprene fabric is too weak,"Ordered this among several other similar straps, to pick the best one. This was my least favorite.The biggest problem was the connector between the neoprene fabric and the rest of the strap. I gave it a bit of a stress test by giving it a sharp yank and it came apart - the stud that went through the neoprene ripped out of the fabric. This probably wouldn't happen if you were being careful, but I could see the strap ripping if you get the camera caught on something accidentally... or if someone tries to rip it away from you. I've never seen that happen with any other straps, including the cheap nylon ones that come with most cameras.Moreover - this may be personal preference, but I found that the strap was too long. If I let the camera hang, it would dangle a few inches below my fingers - making it difficult to reach without using my other hand, and making it more likely that it would banged or caught on something."
3,OK wrist strap,"This wrist strap is better than what comes with small compact cameras, but the stretchy material isn't the best for durability."
2,Cheaply made!!,This thing is really cheaply made and makes me worried that it will break and the camera will him the ground. Would probably return if it was not so inexpensive.
5,Goo Dee,Funny when brandished subsidizing subsidizing subsidised Rossini quote with sidekick xxx Jack ieizkxkdidiwisisxksksisis episodic subsidizing Doritos ok McHugh. Dueususjxixi Dee wow prejudice sidekick j
2,inappropriate content,"We love the kid friendly parts of this book. BUT there is a lot of stuff I don't want my six year old reading, so I have to read it with him and edit out the parts about medieval torture, insults, etc. I was looking for something he could read on his own."
5,Instant hit,"My 8 years- old instant favorite. He is constantly telling me odd facts that he read in the book and almost each conversation from him starts with ""Did you know that....."". He loves to take it with him and share it with his friends."
4,very good confirmation of original issues in early church,The book contains material that I have wanted to get my hands on for a long long time. It is unfortunate that many of the words are missing because of the age of the found manuscripts. It confirms the issues that the early Church had with the different ways of preentin Christ to the world. Through the many studies that have disected the present Popular Gospel I now understand that the early Church Fathers knew what they were doing by letting themselves be guided by the Holy Spirit and not selecting these writings or gnostic Gospels in the complete texts of the present Gospel.
2,Very dissapointed,I bought this item with the intentions of putting all of my daughters stuffed animals inside the hammock. When i purchased the item it stated on the box that it is a 7 foot long jumbo toy hammock. When i opened this item i discovered that it is only about 5 feet long. That is a two foot difference! Now all of her stuffed animals won't fit inside. And for 9.99 what a rip off! It should be more like 5.99. What a joke! I am going to complain to toys-r-us asap.
3,I should have read the description better...,"I purchased this for a different use than hanging toys. The information clearly states the size - 34x34x45-inches. Had I been paying better attention, I would have realized it was going to be a little small for what I needed; that is my fault, not the manufacturers. I expected it to be a little stretchy and it was not.For what it is, it's a little overpriced."
4,A transformative coffee experience,"My wife and I were delighted with the flavor from this Melitta MEP6 (otherwise known as Java Perk), having managed--somehow--on a cheap drip system for far too long. Set-up and maintenance is really easy, and the sound of it ""perking"" is delightful. It's also well-made and attractive.Be warned, though--""6 cups"" means six 5-ounce cups, means not quite four regular mug-fulls. Great for two people, though, and fast. Highly recommended."
2,Wonderful yet flawed,"This could be the world's best little perculator except for one major flaw. The clear viewing ball on the lid is made of plastic, becomes brittle in relatively short time, and it WILL break. According to the manufacturer, you cannot simply purchase the ball - you must replace the entire lid. When I tried to order the lid, there were none in stock. It is pretty though!"
5,Everything you would want,"This little 6-cup percolator is the best thing I have bought in a long time. I make my own coffee bean blend and custom grind it each morning, and even though the drip method makes great coffee, it misses the distinctive richness of your specific coffee that you can get with the percolator, hands down! I didn't want to spend alot of money but percolators can be pricey. The beauty of this model is that you do not have to use a filter, yippee! (no grounds in my cup)! Who wants to deal with that when you are half asleep? It brews very quickly, keeps it good and hot without baking it, and the pour spout doesn't dribble down the body either. I have found this to be a very well designed item. It is a very good value and a delight to use."
2,Not worth the trouble,"I bought this product hoping that it would produce the kind of coffee I remembered from years back. I tried a few different coffees in this pot, but none could reproduce that memory, nor could this pot make better coffee than my Starbuck drip coffee maker. The pot works fine, but the coffee it produces is not worth the price tag. I think I'll stick with drip."
1,Too Trite for Bookclubs,"My bookclub rarely agrees on the quality of the books we choose, but we all agree this is poorly-written fiction. For example (and this is only one), the author used pronouns very sparingly, which made the narrative voice sound like a fourth-grade reading primer. Any enticing themes the story contains are overpowered by the annoying writing style. If you're looking for ""stark prose"" (a phrase used in a review for this book), pick up Hemingway instead."
1,it worked the first time,"This cotton candy maker is poorly made. the first time we used this product it did make cotton candy, but it was not enough to fill the cone.The second batch the sugar burned and did not make cotton candy. There is no way to turn down the temperature."
4,What a great gift,My husband loves cotton candy and I thought what a great father's day gift. Well it went over wonderfully. The first batch takes a little while and isn't very large but once you get to the second it was alot of fun and so much more - He was so proud. I read alot of reviews saying that people couldn't find the cotton candy sugar - well with just a little searching on the internet - I found several sites.
4,I love this!,"This cotton candy maker is the perfect thing for home use! We love it.. I would recomend it to any one that is going to buy one for home use.. It is not for really heavy usage such as you would with a fair machine. You can buy the flavored sugar anywere that rents party supplies! Regular sugar will work just fine also!The slower you wind the cotton candy the puffier it will be! This machine is so good my 4 year old son can make his own! We love it! I did only give it 4 stars becasue after about the 6th scoop you will probally should take a rubber spatula and scoop out the harden sugar, which is normal for these machines.."
3,No flavored sugars included,"I was so anxious to take it out of the box and begin using it immediately. I was very disappointed to find out that no flavored sugars were included with the cotton candy machine. Now I am having trouble finding a place to buy the flavored sugars for cotton candy I want to try. I've check with party rental places on the internet, but have been unable to find one who supplies the flavored sugars."
2,not for beginners,"I bought this for my 9 year old son. He has been taking piano for a couple of years and is between a level 1 and 2 in most piano books. This book has great songs in it, but is not easy."
2,Too easy,"Hal-Leonard has 5 different books called ""The Charlie Brown Collection"" and this one is supposed to be the most difficult. It's still easy and simplified; a lot different of what we are used to listen (David Benoit playing, for example). It's disapointing..."
3,Some good ideas.,"This book takes you into the real problems of starting a business. I found it interesting reading. There really isn't much here that isn't covered in other entrepreneurship books, but it tries to give you a common sense approach. Easy reading, but lacks in advanced techniques."
3,only windows 98 version is available.,it is good CD but but not that PRO. Search for another CD which is more complicated and more effective!
4,"More artwork, please!","I primarily purchased this book because I love Dame Darcy's artistic style. I wish there had been artwork accompanying the text. That being said, the story and plot of In the Garden of Poisonous Flowers was interesting, it simply felt unfinished. Too many questions were left unanswered, too many back stories were left unexplained. The writing is gripping, and the art work is exquisite. Perhaps if I continue with the Threshold series, my questions will be answered."
4,The cure for the Summertime blues,"I'm a huge fan of Roy Meriwether (other than Jesus Christ, Superstar). It's so sad that his early work for Capitol and Columbia in the 60's hasn't been reissued. I just picked up the vinyl copy of Opening Night, Volume 1, which includes the first five tracks that are on the CD. Oh my God. Buy it. This was first issued in '87 on Gemini, and it's amazing to hear that, though the gospel influence has not as much in the foreground, his playing is still as compelling. The way he shreds the piano on Summertime is simply unbelievable and incomparable. Then, as the other reviewer mentioned, he literally does whip the crowd into a frenzy with After Hours. Mad props to a Miami Valley boy and one of the greatest musicians I've ever heard."
2,block n roll,not a good product. falls apart easily and doesn't have many pieces to it...wouldn't reccommend this for any age group.
3,"fine, but","The house is very solid and lovely, but I was disappointed that its color is light brown instead of the beautiful red color that it looks like on my monitor."
2,No good for import,I guess it's fine if you want to do a lot of data input by hand and from scratch. But if you have data in a database like Access that you want to import you will be frustrated. Constant error messages and it seems like it would take longer to find all the errors in the import file than it would to do the data entry! I gave up.
2,I am returning mine,"I bought the Breadman TR800 from another catalog. I have owned one other bread machine in the past. This one baked fine, but was SO NOISY we couldn't tolerate it. It's getting shipped back today.I came to Amazon to check out what else is available and what others have said about those machines. This machine, besides being noisy, only has 1 blade which I guess is no longer the standard. It sounds like 2 is better. I am considering the one that starts with a Z, but I can't go back to that page to learn the spelling. I hope this helps you in your decision making."
4,Great bread and jam!,"I've had my breadman plus for exactly one year. This machine has seen a lot of use! The bread is very good and the jam is even better. We've treated ourselves to breakfasts of fresh-made bread, using the timer device, with delicious homemade blueberry, blackberry, raspberry and strawberry jams also made in the breadmaker. We also enjoy making our own pizza by making the dough in the breadman, then baking it with toppings, on a pizza stone in our oven.The only downside to this machine is the noise the paddle makes. I may have to move it to the basement for those early morning loaves!"
4,Wake up to the aroma of bread!,"We just bought our Breadman Plus and we are enjoying fresh bread with our dinners and delicious toast for breakfast! We especially like waking up to the smell of bread on a Sunday morning.In the future, after this machine is very old and very used, we will probably buy one with 2 blades. But until then, we are going to enjoy the smells and tastes that the Breadman Plus is offering us!"
2,Disappointed with company who shipped product,"I ordered this new breadmaker for my parents as a gift. Upon opening, they found breadcrumbs inside, as if it had been used. I've heard these machines are very good. Although I would not use Cyebye.com as the shipper."
1,Hunk Of Junk,Noisy first of all!The first machine worked for a while and then went dead.They sent us a new one and it had problems too.The part that turns the turns the paddle slips on the motor shaft making a loud popping noise every few seconds.Weare sending it back for a refund and getting something else.
2,READ THE PACKAGING,"I went to HD today to buy this product because I figured I'd get a head start on the crabgrass this year. The packaging states that you cannot plant any new seed for 4 months after placing this down. If you are someone who likes to overseed the lawn every year, you cannot place this down beforehand. It also states you cannot rake for 4 months afterwards otherwise you will disturb the crabgrass barrier it creates."
3,Quality not so good,The quality of the hat wasn't really that great from what I had expected from a New Era hat. Some of the stitching on the top triangle overlaps another. This creates somewhat of a lopsidedness to the top of the hat.
2,Terrible,Well i thought the hat was going too come in a box but that wasn't the case the hat was in a bag and when i got it it wus bent out of shape and i couldn't fix the problem
4,Interesting.,Full of fun interesting stories but not a book I would want to read again. The books sounds like it is a collection of Gregs adventures that may have been published somewhere before.
4,Well written and entertaining,This is a fun book to read. Just enough about the flying to keep it interesting for me as a pilot and entertaining enough for you non pilots out there as well. Each chapter feels like an adventure!
3,Geez!,"Against my better judgment I read part of this but couldn't bring myself to finish it. I should have trusted my gut--after reading his numerous articles in AOPA publications, which are really terrible, I shouldn't have been surprised that I didn't like his book. His writings are a real snooze."
1,Another flier who sadly cannot write,"While the author may be a delightful man and a capable pilot, this book goes on the growing heap of failures in writing about flying, so far as i am concerned. In fact, it goes fairly far down even that heap, since i am one of those who can see most books to the end, but finally could not be bothered with this one.I have learnt that fliers who can write are very rare birds indeed.I am now learning to carefully ignore the reviewer star ratings here when making my own selections."
5,Excellent book for all seeking adventure,I am a student pilot and have been reading just about everything I can get my hands on that has to do with flying for the past two years. I first learned of Greg Brown through his Flying Carpet column in AOPA's Flight Training magazine and enjoyed his articles and writing. I stumbled upon this book through a search on Amazon and am so glad I did!The book is extremely well written and you can tell through each page how deep Greg's passion is for flying and for sharing it with those around him. I felt as if I were along for the ride to all of the wonderful destinations he has been to.I highly recommend the book not only for those interested in flying but the non-fliers alike!
3,Blondie rocks,"Blondie's portion of the album is great but Pat Benatar has only one good song ""Love is a battlefield"". I f I had to rate them separatly Blondie would get 5 stars and Pat would get 1."
3,Pat & Blondie,"It was nice to hear the old songs they had, but I would not like a steady diet of them."
5,"TWO GREAT ARTISTS,......ONE GREAT PRICE","THE BLONDIE HITS HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME. THEY ARE STILL ON THE RADIOAND THEY WERE RECORDED WELL. THE PAT BENATAR TUNES ARE GOOD BUT SOME ARE NOT AS FAMOUS. ANYWAY, FOR UNDER $10 INCLUDING SHIPPING, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG."
3,CD-G Question,"Can someone who owns this item, please make a posting to indicate if it will play CD-G format disks and PROPERLY SHOW the video?Thanks."
2,A little dissapointing,"I grew up in Orange county in the 50""s & 60""s , I thought this would be a great present for my brother, we were both dissapointed in the amount of information that it contained. However the shipping from vendor was quick."
3,"Smells horrible, cat likes it",My cat likes this one so-so. Doesn't clean the dish like she does with the tomato bisque flavor but it smells soooo bad its unreal! Won't buy this flavor again but will stick with the brand...
4,"Nice, but what's with the useless spout?","I highly recommend this machine, but be careful when you pour--coffee tends to dribble down the side if it's not tilted juuust right......and if you're looking for the PERFECT CUP OF COFFEE, go find a tin of D'Aquino Italian Espresso coffee (mostly available on the west coast). It is sublime."
4,Kristy gets too wrapped up as usual. :o),"Kristy runs for class president, and gets wrapped up, as usual. She forgets about stuff, makes a big deal out of little things, and most of all, she's rude to her friend Pete Stone. He's also running for president. I thought this book was not going to be a good one at first, but it's ok. Kristy finally realizes that winning's not all that counts. Friends like Pete and the Baby-sitters club is most important.This did turn out to be a good book. Don't let the beginning make u not read it."
4,good lesson,"Kristy leads a busy life. She's president of the baby sitters club, she coaches a softball team for kids, she's a hard worker at school and now she is trying out for class president but she gets way too caught up in it that she's suffering with her schoolwork and has to look at what she really wants to do. I can relate to this book and I'm sure a lot of young people can too if you're one to be involved with too many responsibilites and extra ciricular activities."
3,Clearly an early work,"Ever since I picked up purely by accident 'Becoming A Man', Monette has become one of my favourite authors. And that rarely are authors like him recognized for his gift as are their sexual orientation.Because I've read his latter works before this, being an early work, it shows that Monette has always had the gift of the written gab. He doesn't so much as run a light finger through life as caress it and unlike other authors who rape it.But comparing, the latter works obviously show his improvement. He beats around the bust a lot more and takes some time to get to the point.The part I didn't appreciate was the extended ending after the story climaxed, but you can always excuse that as inexperience.But I'd still recommend it to Monette fans."
4,Glamorous Gay Men Who Love Each Other,"I loved this book ... probably the most overlooked of all Monette's work. Pre- AIDS, it's fun and frothy, with a great set of characters. A good mystery, it's also a refreshing love story aobut two men who understand each other and are totally confident in each other's love!"
2,A curiosity,"This curiosity, written in a turgid style, will be of interest to the student of Mormonism, and to the student of the esoteric and the bizarre. With regard to the Book of Abraham, for those who refuse to accept the new translation of the papyrus, let me say that the third illustration shows a crowned figure seated on a throne, with a female behind him, and three figures facing him, one of whom is a female. Joseph Smith in his caption identifies the two female figures as male. It is evident that (a) Smith didn't know the difference between male and female costumes in Egypt, and (b) the caption is patently false, and (c) therefore we may suppose, on the basis of this caption alone, that the document as Smith presents it is a fraud."
1,Another Mormon fantasy,"This book, as is the entire Mormon religion, is a mirage. The ""Pearl"" was ""translated"" by the charlatan and barely literate Joseph Smith from ""papyri"" whose actual content are not even close to what is actually in the text. It has been proven that the historical, biological, and archeological basis of the Mormon religion is based on the fraudulent fantasies of a con man and his ""oh goody, I can have ten 15 year old wives?"" gang.It is pathetic and disturbing that otherwise rational people can possibly believe the Mormon mumbo jumbo of the gold plates and seer stones, breast plates, and all the other fairy tales from the Church of Latter Day delusions."
5,Best Fragrance Ever!,"I've had countless colognes and this is by far my favorite. I wish they would make it into a permanent summer scent, but in case they don't I bought three bottles... enough said!"
5,Totally Awesome!,This great piece of german rock music is a must for every german and wannabe or the one that understands this language. Marius has the best songs on this album! SEXY and all the other good ones ! buy and you won't miss out in some real good german rock music. Ole
1,MESSY,"Though that this would be so cute, but it shoots popcorn all over the place, the opening is to large, and unless you have a very large shallow bowl your going to get alot of popcorn on your counter & Floor."
2,"I agree with others: Cute, but not a great popper","Taz seems well-made and is certainly cute, but the designers were obviously not well-versed in popcorn dynamics. Popcorn flies everywhere (which delights the kids) and in the process it pushes a hefty number of unpopped kernels out as well.I wish I'd gone for the plain-jane popper when I replaced my previous air popper."
1,Design Flaw,"Yes this item is ""cute"" but there seems to be a design flaw in that it wastes so much popcorn. Not only does it spew popcorn all over the counter and floor if you do not have a big enough bowl, it results in 20-30% old maids."
2,Not bad - but you probably won't use it as much as you think,"We live in Florida and have a grapefruit tree in our yard, therefore, I thought a juicer would be a must have. After receiving the Juiceman, we used it several times. It does work pretty much as advertised. My problem is that it is easier to just hand squeeze the grapefruit directly into a picture instead of going to all the hassle and cleanup required by the Juiceman. We still make grapefruit juice all the time, we just don't use the Juiceman. I wish I still had money in my wallet instead of a Juiceman tucked away deep in the kitchen cabinets."
1,"Juiceman 410, Junk Juicer","I've had this juicer about 15 months and the motor just stopped without warning. SALTON does NOT sell ANY JUICER REPLACEMENT PARTS, so I now own more junk that must be thrown out."
1,Not a durable machine,"My wife and I used our machine almost every day. We had problems with the motor on the first machine after about 6 months. The replacement machine tah was sent just started spitting out pieces of cooper wire recently, and has now died altogether. Salton won't replace it because it is beyond the ONE year warranty. 2 machines in less than 2 years. If they build such a great machine, why does it only have a 1 year warranty? Think about that before you buy. If you plan on owning a juicer for a long time, get one with a better warranty."
3,Too powerful for its own good,"I bought this juicer because it is the most powerful that I could find and I planned to juice a lot of carrots, which is hard on the machine. At first I was very pleased but the lid developed 'melted' spots so Juiceman sent me another one for free. It seemed like with each use I would develop another 'weak' spot in the lid so I returned the entire machine and bought a Champion juicer instead, which so far I like. It is a masticating juicer (it takes the vegetable apart), wheras the juiceman II flings the juice around the machine which from what I understand oxidizes the juice and leaves it with less vitamins/minerals."
1,Not as good as on TV!,"The juicer is extremely noisy. I don't know what they did to the one that he demonstrates with on the informercial, but I have to wear earplugs when use mine. Family has to leave the kitchen when I make juice. The unit vibrates so bad that the little rubber slash guard always falls into the juice. Unless you juice real slow, juice leaks all over the motor. In the informercial, he pushes carrots through there in a fraction of a second. The clean up is a nightmare with all the leaked juice... I thought the Juiceman would be faster and extract more juice. And you can't even get through to Salton. Several times, I've waited up to 20 minutes waiting to get through to someone. I just can't wait any longer listing to their recordings over and over!"
1,piece of junk,"amazon is great but this juicer is noisey,slow and i dont think it will last a year. big $100 MISTAKE."
1,Stay Away From This Piece of JUNK!,"I bought this item as a Christmas gift, and the motor didn't last a week.Don't let the price fool you. You get what you pay for, and what you get in this deal is a piece of JUNK."
1,Returned 2 - Burnt Out Motors,"Burnt out the motor on the first one within 3 months, exchanged for a new one, burnt out the motor on the 2nd one within 6 months. I only used the lower power setting and was only juicing carrots."
5,"Hats off to Warioware, its ancestors, and its descendants!","Though I beat it in around four hours, this game provides great replay value, and gives eyedazzling numbers of games and genres. Though it is easy, it is a true tip of the hat to the technological possibilities of the DS. Long live for Wario, Mario, Luigi, and Waluigi!"
3,Too easy...,"I loved the 1st Wario Ware for Advance- it took a lot of effort to really 'finish' the game. i beat the main game of the DS version in an hour, if that. i don't think i failed once until one of the last 'mixes'. that's not to say this game isn't fun to play, or the mini-games aren't creative-- they are- but they should have been slightly more chalenging."
4,A fun and wacky game,"WarioWare: Touched is a great game. The mini-games are fun because of the DS's touch screen. For instance, there's a game where you have to unroll a toilet paper roll. There's also microphone mini-games, such as blowing into the mic to land a paper airplane into a target. The game lacks in difficulty, because it's just too darn easy! I beat the game in a couple of days, because it was so short also. But the main purpose is to play the game over and over again to get more games. You can practice the games also, which is like taking a test. You have to beat the same game a number of times to pass. Since the games are so easy, you'll probably pass the practice with a 70, when you only needed a 15. Over all, the game is very fun, it's too easy and fast, and it's a must-have for the DS."
2,very short,it was fun for the first two hours not using any buttons but the touch screen and microphone. But soon got repetitive.
3,Dissapointment,"This was my most anticipated game for DS, and when I finally get it, it sucks. All of the games are ""Touch the thing"" or ""Blow in the Microphone"" and win. The unlockable things really suck. It's way too easy, I beat it 2 days after I got it. At least Warioware Twisted for gba is coming out soon..."
2,bad review,for this game it is a dissapointment. It really gets boring and repetitive. This game only takes about twenty minutes to beat and is a rip off game.
1,Arniest says... THESE ARE THE GAMES!,"Help! A little piggy is trapped! Save him or you'll die!This game is generally stupid. I beat it in 2 years. It's immature, rude, childish, and one thing, it is mean."
4,I'd give it a 4.5 actually.,Wario has come up with another pack of addictive mini-games but I would have to say I'm quite disappointed. It's not as good as the 1st WarioWare that was for GBA. The price is a little WAY too high for this game that's old now. I was hoping the price would go down after it get's old and new/better games come out but the price didn't even drop a few dollars ... few pennies at most. This game was a disappointment to me and I don't play it as often as I do with the Tamagotchi Corner Shop that I got when I bought this one. Not worth the price ! Wait til someone tosses it in the used and abused pile.
4,do not touch the bad,Wario Ware touch is a great game but here are my complaints1. i got the game on Saturday evening and beat THE WHOLE GAMEon Monday after school.2. their is a lot of gross and mean things in this game. Like nose picking and killing animalsBut the characters are great the game is a blast and if you think you can handle weird stuff then I would buy it. A wario touched obsessor probably thinks nose picking in games is not gross
5,Avery addicting game.,"You know how you play one of those simple, basic , yet difficult computer games that you get so addicted to? Well, this is one of those games on an advanced scale! It is so addicting that you will have a VERY hard time putting it down! It is pretty much a GIGANTIC arcade put into a small system. There is also a Toy Room, well, 2 toy rooms that if you beat a certain score on each chracters games, you unlock a new toy! You even unlock a parrot that repeats what you say into your build in microphone! You can also unlock a yo yo, a thing of gelatin to jiggle (which IS addicting), and a lot , or should I say TON of more stuff! So you NEED to get this game!"
4,It's a great game!,"It's funny and cute, and just something you can't put down. They utilize the ds functions very well, and the replay value is there."
2,Very boring ...,"I'm really not sure why people like this game. It's just full of these mini touch games that take a few seconds like hitting flies, pulling strings, popping balloons and the storyline takes such a long time, and it's not that interesting either. The mini games really aren't fun. Maybe if you're incrediblyyy bored, but with the wait of Wario going to places for the storyline, it just increases your boredom."
5,Funny and cool,"Over a 150 minigames to play awsome. I just love the worioware games they rock they always give us more and more games to play. This is one is just so funny you can even play games for the old games. I like playing the games and not only doy you touch you spin, drag, and rub. I like the playing the glanry mix beacuse it really puts you to the test of how fast you can go. If you like DS games were you have to touch stuff this is for you."
3,"Good, but not great","I liked this game, I have to admit that it is a very fun game, but the lack of wifi support, and the fact it is easy until you get into the mixes makes this game far from great. Don't get me wrong though, I still find myself playing the game, and humming along with the infectious music, guess with such a limited release and seeing it sell for so much at some places, I was just expecting a much better game."
3,Kinda Easy,one of the few games i have for my DS collection. this is a great game. all the mini games on here are challenging at times. but some are just too easy. i like the game room. you win prizes after you complete one of the mini games. after awhile i started to lose interest in the game. i would only reccomend this game to children.
4,Way too short!!!,"I purchased this game early in the afternoon today, and I loved it right away. It was really fun, but after an hour and 1/2 of playing it, I beat it!!! The only reason I gave this game 4 stars (5 fun), was because of how short it was. If it was longer it would have been my favorite DS game by far, but I'm not so sure now. I beat all the bosses and the 3 bears too. This game is really fun and never let's you take a break!!! It's a fast paced game especially when you get to the ""gnarly bear"". This game is a lot of fun, but can get kind of repetive by playing all the games a billion times. I'm going to go back to some other games, and when I need a break from those, I will pick up Wario Ware and get ready for some fast paced fun!"
5,Awesome,"This game is awesome. It is a game with pointless mini games. Dont get me wrong i love this game and all its pointless (but fun) minigames or a.k.a microgames (called that in the game). I mean Nintendo DSers this game is one of the first games that uses the microphone. How sick is that. I love this game. It is 100% better then that stupid game feel the magic. It is probably the best game i have. I have a lot of games (Madden2005, SuperMario64 DS, Urbs, and Spiderman 2), but this game is probably the best of all. I mean eating a doeghnut, Scracthing a back, popping baloons, and my favorite ( or atleast 1 of them because they r all awesome) rolling down toilet paper untill all of it runs out r only some of the most awesome games this game. Like i said before this game is awesome."
5,Wario has got the touch!,"Wario ware games are really fun. Famous for their mad microgames. That what i think makes this one so fun. You can do mixes so you don't know what kind of game you are going to play next. (quick cuts across the screen, dragging it, rubbing etc.) The soveiniers are really dumb though. That's the only flaw though."
4,A Good Easy Game,WarioWare Touched really utilizes the touchpad. Infact that's all you use! The game is fairly easy but has some good replay value! I highly recommend the game for the DS. It's the best game so far onthe system! Enjoy
5,Find it,"Another masterpiece by the Tentacles, though this one seems to have fallen through the cracks. Try the web page for a music store called Muzos. Tracks: Cat DNA, Ahu Belahu, Ghedengi, Wob Glass, Neurochasm, Become the Other, Vibuthi, PlurnstyleTrack one is simply a ripper, and Ahu is the typical Ozric interlude track: short and soundy. The next three tunes take you down some pretty sick corridors until you're soothed by the title track. Then, Vibuthi. This song does every trick in the Ozric book. Ed starts out acoustic, and very Arabic, and by the end of the song he's blitzed you with as much speed and distortion as you'll need. Plurnstyle: bouncy; perfect album closer."
2,OK for travel novices,Very marginal - I suppose this would be alright if you never fly or have never booked your own flights. Most of the information was pretty basic. The in depth information presented had more to do with WHY airlines do the things they do rather than how you can find cheap flights. I honestly don't think I found anything in here that I didn't already know.
4,POWERFUL MESSAGE,"Whatever you might think of Hillary, this is the book that will make you evaluate and consider, and even do more research. She is a liberal radical brought up in a conservative household. She is good at the blame game, blaming the Middle East Wars on Bush (like Obama and the rest of the white house folks do with everything else), blaming a right wing conspiracy for exposing husband Bill and his many sexual indiscretions, the Arkansas land scandals, etc. She packages herself as ""Every Woman,"" but the author views her (with supporting documentaiton) as ""a formula of opportunism, acquiescence and dependency that has actually set women back rather than lead them forward."" Every American should read this in relation to Hillary's future political goals. Young women should beware the ""Hillary Trap."" The author is a fine writer,columnist, and a TV pundit. I like her wit and style."
2,If You Hate Hilary Clinton.....,"....you will love this book. I am not a big fan of Hilary Clinton but I have to say I was disappointed in this book. I was looking for an analysis of what makes Mrs. Clinton tick, not a criticism of social programs from the past three decades. Although I agree with some of Ms. Ingraham's view points, I am not ready to blame Hilary for every social problem in America. Overall opinion: too much rhetoric, not enough information."
1,glad I didn't buy it!,"As I read chapter after chapter I was appalled at the way Ms. Ingraham slammed everything and everybody and tore them to shreds. She had a very persuasive arguement against Hillary, against feminists, against government, against non-Christians, against Democrats; and even to some extent against marriage. Although the book appears to be well researched; it seems Laura wrote this book strictly to get her own extremely conservative, biased, viewpoints & opinions heard. I am so glad I didn't waste my money on this book and I am equally glad it was a short book as the ranting and raving seems to be just a wee bit obsessive!"
1,The Laura Trap,"It is tragic-comedic projection - that Ms. Ingraham (whose early career included a stint as an underling to Clarence Thomas)would attempt to portray Hillary Clinton as a 'victim'- of her male-dominated relationships.If you must read this book, please first read 'Blinded By The Right' by David Brock. If you still feel so inclined, then check Laura's book out at the local library - and save some trees!Laura and Ann Coulter are to intellectual discourse - what Clarence Thomas is to truth. Sadly, underneath all of the tokenism, hypocrisy and 'trial lawyer-turned celebrity' veneer - we are left with a hollow shell."
1,Oops she did it again,Our little pit bull's done it again! The dear should stick to tv cause she has such trouble with words...
1,right wing junque,I reviewed this book for work. It is nothing but part of the Clinton-hating cottage industry. Not even very well done.
1,Preaching To The Choir,"Laura is yet another Rush Limbaugh clone. Read this book if you are an anti-progressive reactionary ...you'll love it. If, however, you are a member of the human race, don't bother. For the moment, Clinton hating is fashionable, so I suppose we can credit Laura for her sense of timing. Laura does not, however, strike me as clever or witty, or even very insightful, but her built-in audience will keep her in business for a little while longer, I suppose. Avoid."
5,"On the Hillary Watch--Be Afraid, Very Afraid","Everyone knows that Hillary is running for president. This book, more than any book about the former First Lady, tells us why it should be BUYER BEWARE. Her views are those of a '60s socialist throwback. Modern woman? Hillary is the exact opposite and Ingraham exposes this flawlessly."
2,Take it easy,"I do not like Hillary ether, But this book crosses the line of informative, on her and her politics, to an I hate Hillary rant."
2,If You Hate Hilary Clinton.....,"....you will love this book. I am not a big fan of Hilary but I have to say I was disappointed in this book. I was looking for an analysis of what makes Mrs. Clinton tick, not a criticism of social programs from the past three decades. Although I agree with some of Ms. Ingraham's view points, I am not ready to blame Hilary for every social problem in America. Overall opinion: too much rhetoric, not enough information."
1,Another right wing polemic,"Oh dear, here we have another right wing polemic to add onto the ones by Peggy Noonan and Barbara Olsen. Nothing new here since this is the same mantra we've heard before concerning the power hungry Hillary.Ms. Ingraham, who has never met or interviewed Hillary, has a great time discussing what she thinks motivates the First Lady. Her discussions about the Clinton marriage are another example of how easy it is to disseminate unsubstantiated hate filled opinions. Save you money."
4,Sister Sister,"The Hillary Trap is a reader which exposes the failed feminist theory still being pushed by the victim fanfare of the Hillary Clan. In it are seven sections each titled with a different trap. ""The sisterhood trap,"" ""The Education Trap,"" ""The Work Trap,"" etc. which are all traps utilized by Hillary and her group-thinkers to spread the disease of victimhood thinking, lesson individual responsibility and freedom, and gain more government control for ""The Village,"" theory.An important read for anyone who wishes to clarify the underpinnings of feminist group-thinking, victimization attitudes, or social theory concerning personal responsibility and the tacits of personal freedom."
1,the pot calling the kettle black,"Those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. So, Ms Ingraham, you better check your own homeowner's policy."
2,A Comparison,"At first glance Ms. Ingrahams hypothisis of dependancy it fascinating. She agurgues her case and come close to convincing me. Then however wecome to a stop. Her arguement that Hillary has only got where she has today through her husband may have merit, but can we all please remember that George Bush Jn. had even less experience on entering the White House. He got to his position depending on his father and brother, we can not lambast Hillary for something which we praise George for.In writing this book in the first place Laura Ingraham becomes that which she hates the most, in writing a defence of feminism she fails herself and her cause through only criticising a woman. This culture of dependancy is prevelant in every part of society, and in the opinion of this reviewer is nothing more than a thinly veiled bout of liberal bashing."
1,Another Right Wing Hatchet Job,"Laura Ingraham joins the rest of the Anti-Clinton crowd in writing a book condemning them.I am always amazed at those who know what they want to say and then go out and find/make up sources to support them. Of course, anything that puts them off message is to be discarded.Since I am sure that the people they attack will never respond to these form of attacks, it is a one sided argument at best.I prefer to save my money for serious journalists who are out to print the truth and not their political viewpoint.I would have more respect for Laura Ingraham if she wrote a book about George W Bush or Rick Lazio or anybody in her political camp.The point is once you sacrifice objectivity, then anything you write is not a matter of non fiction but a slanted critique that is best read by those who don't want the truth; only a reinforcement of their viewpoints...."
1,Poor Laura,"When I think about what I would want my legacy to be - Senate candidate, First Lady, Advocate for Children and Women - or caustic, media pundit in a leopard skin skirt - it's not a hard choice. Laura Ingraham owes her soul, fat bank account and SUV to Bill and Hillary Clinton. But for the cable media's obsession with Clinton-bashing, no one would be airing or caring about Ingraham's vapid and snide opinions.Since her days at Dartmouth, Laura has built a career by packaging her sex appeal and poisonous tongue into the anti-feminist version of Gloria Steinam..."
1,Consider the source.,"Do we expect objectivity or accuracy from a woman who's made a career out of trying to undermine Bill Clinton's authority as president and Hillary Clinton's reputation as first lady? Oh, please. Unless you're a hard right-winger who enjoys a good wallow in anti-Clinton screeds, don't waste your time or money on this one."
2,So So!,"Should this book be titled The New Scratchboard? It really is'nt what I would say scratchboard is about, although it has plenty of nice color artwork done on claybord it only has 20 pages on scratchbord and thats using the authors technique of value scratching not high contract scratchboard that I like. (personally I dont think his stuff is that great) If you looking for a book on scratchboard dont get this. Buy Mastering the Art of Scratchboard. If your looking for a book on claybord then be my guest and buy it."
4,Nice condensed book,This is a great book to support all the information you can get in a single continuum mechanics class. It could be nice if it has a more detailed treatment of the mohr's circle because of his power in 2D and an approach to the analysis of shells and plates.Best regards and enjoy it!
2,They were okay til I washed them...,"Just a word of warning: They are beautiful placemats, but I was looking for something a little bit less time consuming. Every time you dry them in the dryer, even if you immediately pull them out, you need to iron them to even slightly get their shape back."
3,placemats,"Items were as advertised, shrunk a good bit with first washing but still good size and useful. good color, quick delivery"
2,A Poor Reproduction with a Nice Cover!,"Because the content of such older publications is of great interest to the researcher, I was disappointed in the poorly scanned results offered in this booklet. While the cover is an attractive and sturdy piece of work, the actual scanning of the original document cut off one margin of virtually every page, making it particularly useless when those pages contained columnar lists of mining company names or other vital details.In addition, a number of pages appeared to be completely missing (based on the numbering in the original), and it therefore appears to be an incomplete and shoddy work, at best. I suggest you hold out for an original of this item, rather than purchase the scanned reprint offered here."
4,Great!!!,Love this book on the Welsh revival... Very well written! The author interviewed several key people and is very unbiased.
4,"Works as expected, good unit","This is our second grill. The first served us well, but we eventually replaced it (after perhaps 5 years) because the non-slip coating finally peeled off.When we reordered, we chose this model because it did not have the bun warmer, which we never used - and this makes the unit slimmer for storage.The unit is sized well for 2 people - if I had more, I would get a larger one.Suggestions:1) When cleaning, consider not using the scraper, but rather take a wet washcloth and apply to soak when the unit is still hot. Then use a scrubbing motion. At least with the last model the scraper started to chip off the Silverstone after a number of months. They may have changed the material for the scraper, however to alleviate this problem.2) Removable grill plates would be useful, but probably would increase the cost of the unit too much."
2,Messy,Too hard to clean--wish I could put it in dishwasher or submerge.Cleaning directions vague. Cooks good .
5,It's Great!,"I have had my George Foreman Grill for 6 days, and I have used it 6 times! I have read some of the reviews of others and a main theme seems to be that it is too small. HELLO! There are several different sizes of this grill available. You do not have to buy the smallest one. I personally did buy the smallest one, and it is perfect for making a meal for 1 or 2 people. Most items cook in 5 minutes or less, and everything turns out moist. I have made lean steaks, chicken breasts, hamburgers, pork sirloins, and have enjoyed them all. This grill is a great way to cook fast healthy meals."
2,Good Food Easy Cooking,"This grill is a wonder, easy to cook, keeps the fat away, and easy to clean. However it lacks an on/off switch, you have to pull the plug and it only has one heat setting, Very Hot."
2,Champ Grill for midgets,"The image on the website gives a totally false picture as it relates to the grilling surface.When we received the grill we found out that it will barely hold a ""real burger"" of 1/4Lb so for family use this item is useless. Subsequently we returned the item for credit and we will be shopping for a larger model, which preferable may have removable grill plates for weasy cleaning. Sorry for the negative news.Robert Wullaert"
1,"No on/off switch, no power levels","This thing is a piece of junk. There is no on/off swich, no power level and burns the outside while leaving the inside cold"
3,Non-stick surface = not made for high heat or durable over time,"Bacon, sausage and ground meats put off natural oils. They stick less to cast iron than to the teflon (I think the non-stick is a teflon or copycat). We used this product for a number of years, but have now realized that the teflon coating is coming off. The grease gets so hot that the teflon can't handle it (you should never cook Teflon pans at high heat anyways).This product gets a 3 overall, because when we first got it it worked well enough. There is no temperature gauge or temperature control, but for short orders it was great!Now that the coating is wearing out and it's a potential health threat, the grill is 'garbage' to us - we don't feel comfortable even giving it away.We're disappointed that so far, the other Foreman grills boast non-stick surfaces.Give us regular cast-iron, George! Please?"
4,Good...but....,"This is grill is great for getting rid of grease but the problem is after only a year the teflon was almost non-existent. I loved it though before it just was unable to cook on it anymore we used it everyday for everything. Sandwiches, meat, and so forth. It was a great product and made the best chicken ever! But, all good things end soon. We never bought a new one because the price is too costly to invest in every year. But, it is a great product if you don't mind investing and also for people who will use it only maybe a few times a week."
4,Family favorite & budget friendly too!,"I purchased this grill for my recently widowed mother to help her to be able to prepare meals for herself. It works just as well as the extra-large family sized one I own, but takes up a lot less space. It's also just the right size to cook smaller portions of food for 1-2 people. I'm actually looking in to getting one for my family. At the price it's being offered, it's a handy little grill for sandwiches & other lunch type meals. I also have cousins in college who swear it's the best thing ever invented for a dorm room, along side of the mini fridge, of course. Definately a favorite buy for my entire family."
5,George Forman Champ Grill,"Does a great job cooking lowfat burgers, sauages, and hot dogs. It sears the outside of the meat and leaves the inside juicy. It also does a great job with veggie burgers. These items cook much better than on a gas grill or in a frying pan. Relatively easy to clean."
3,Manufacturer won't stand behind thier product past 1 year,"I've had my grill over a year now and I really did like it and I usedit all the time. Then one day the cooking surface started bubbling. Icalled the company and they refused to help because they are only warranted for 1 year, after that you have to buy a new one. If I have to buy a new one then I'll buy the Cooks Essentials Grill...because it's warranty is lifetime."
1,Lean Mean Rip Off Machine,I cannot understand for the life of me why people are so fascinated with this product. It doesn't drain all the grease only about 75 percent of it. When it does your food taste bland and the mess it makes is beyond belief. True it has a non stick surface but dare don't over cook something or you'll have to use a blow torch to get the stain off. The only thing it did right when it wasn't setting my smoke alarm off was cook the food evenly. This product was made for people who are too lazy to wait the extra 10 minutes a conventional oven takes to cook food. It's safe to say that mine went from purchase to return in a matter of 2 days. I wouldn't recommend Foreman grills to anyone.
1,not up to my expectations,was not enough to cook just to warm things up . would not recommend this product to any one
1,Misleading information on site,"Buyer beware. Since I was not familiar with the model number of the Forman grills, I was mislead by the retail price shown on the item I purchased. The stores near my home sell the grill which retails for 29.99 for 14.99, so when your site advertised the retail price as 39.99, I thought I was getting the grill which retails in our stores (e.g. Bed Bath and Beyond) at that price. So I ended up spending more than just getting the grill from my local retailer, and I had to wait for it."
2,Buy bigger,"This particular G.F. is too small for most families, I highly recommend the bigger one that will hold from 4 to 6 hamburgers. We use ours constantly. This one would be fine for young marrieds but if you have children, buy a bigger one."
2,Good and bad... mostly bad.,"First off, the basic idea behind these small countertop grills is an excellent one. I've used mine a lot in the six months that I've owned it. The problem with the Foreman grill is that after six months mine is ready for the dumpster. The non-stick coating is pealing, the white plastic outside shell has discolored from heat, the top element gets hotter than the bottom element and does not sit flat on food more than about 3/4 inch in height. I'll buy another countertop grill but it will be a slightly larger one and it won't be a Foreman."
5,MIRACLE MACHINE!,This is the best product for cooking I have ever owned! I prefer it to outside grilles in fact! EVERYONE should own this!
5,George Foreman Grill,"The George Foreman Grill cooks meat quickly,without much fuss,and it is easy to clean-up. The ""Right""unit for the man in the kitchen !"
3,"Alright, but not much different from a frying pan...","When I first got this, I used it a lot. As I used it more and the novelty wore off, it got tiring to use. It is much more difficult to clean than it is made out to be, despite the non-stick interior. This is because of the grooves and everything settles into them. The plastic cleaning spatula is a joke.The notion that it is healthy is absurd. Consumer reports covered this and I will just say, you want healthy food, eat healthy foods; don't cook unhealthy ones with a Foreman grill and expect a miracle.The food that comes out does not taste grilled at all. It tastes like it was cooked in a frying pan, but there are nice stripes on it. There is no temperature control, so many foods burn on the outside before they cook inside.I bought some good pans and find now that broiling and frying are faster, easier to clean up after, and take up less counter space. I figure this will be in my next yard sale. It is basically a glorified electric sandwich maker."
1,"Hot, and Fast -- with a drawback","This grill spouts and spits at you with as much fiery as hell hath it. My wife and I have both burnt our skin, to a blister, on the spit that has come from this grill. It's fast, and hot. And the cleanup is a mess if you leave the grill sit for a day accidentally. Some parts of it are impossible to clean even with the handy-dandy tool that comes with it. A horrible grill that should just not be purchased if you fear for the saftey of your skin."
2,disappointing grill,Thick cuts are a no because meat will not cook all the way though without burning.I tried a couple of small steaks and had to throw them out. Difficult to clean.
1,Forman Grill,I have a grill and the coating on the grill is comming off so its no good. I don't know what to do with it? Any suggestions ?Dave
1,buy only ifyou liketasteless food and you only meat ishambur,"unless you eat hamburgers as your main meat entree, save your money. After cooking a magnificent rib eye steak ( aka ""delmonico"").which I rub with myfavorite White Swan soy sauce( arguably the best in the world)a trace of garlic, I subjected the steak to 7 minutes of this highlytouted cooker for a rare finish, I swore off this "" champ"" as thesteak ended up almost tasteless. Due to circumstances,I. no longer haveaccess to a regular charcoal or gas grill. I returned to a ""lodge"" brand cast iron ""griling pan ( ribbed botton) which approximated the BBQ grill taste by burning stripes in the meat. a mess to season andclean but the food becomes tasty, unlike the "" champ's' results. salmon filet and chicken breast suffered the same fate as my steak."
3,Get it only at a discount....,"This product is not worth its list price... Here are the negatives: Due to the hinge design, the heating is not even. The side closest to the hinge gets hot, while the other side does not. That means food has to be flipped, despite the two-sided cooking surfaces. Positives: It's convenient for a single person."
4,Foodies take note!!!,"I know that most foodies - those of us that take cooking, eating, recipes and grocery shopping very seriously - turn our noses up at ""appliances for the common man"". This thing bears looking at, however. I got one. (actually a bigger one) ""The George"" as my wife and I now refer to this grill, was the perfect substitute for a grill, any kind of grill. I'm terrible when it come to cooking fish. The George takes all the anxiety out of it for me. Make sure whatever you place on the grill has a consistent thickness (and its not too thick) and you simply cannot fail. I discovered that Mr. Foreman's recipe for ground turkey patties is just wonderful and so much better tasting that ground beef. Hey... this thing's only 20 bucks. How can you lose? Do you cook? Buy one. I cook A LOT, and I use The George about 3-4 times a week."
4,A Single Person's Dream,"Finally, a kitchen product that does what the ads say it does! This little gem is perfect for a single person who wants a low-fat burger or other type of sandwich. The picture on the carton shows two hamburger patties being cooked on the grill, but in reality, one good-sized burger patty is about all you can do at one time. The machine heats up quickly, cooks with only a small amount of smoke/spatter, and cleans up well. Whatever you cook will have neat little grill marks on it and these lend to the illusion of an outdoor grill cooked meal. For those who want the woodsy taste, a few drops of liquid smoke on the meat does nicely. The ""floating hinge"" on the machine lets you cook items up to about an inch thick, including hot dogs and medium sized steaks. It is a great value for the money."
3,Durability,"I love my George Foreman grill with one exception. Mine is now just over 2 years old and has gotten a lot of use. But----the non-stick finish is coming off and I am worried about the composition of the metal below lest it contain lead. I really need to get a new one, but am unwilling at this point lest the new one do the same thing. I have always been meticulously careful to use only plastic or paper towels to clean the grill surface and am not sure why this happened. I also would opt the next time for one with temperature control even if it meant I had to go to a slightly large size. Has anyone else had problems of this kind?"
3,No-Stick Surface,"After 1 1/2 years of grilling 2-4 hamburgers per week, carefully following pre-heating instructions, using only the plastic spatula provided by the manufacturer, and carefully washing the surface areas with warm, soapy water and a soft cloth, the self stick coating has come off the grill. Most unsatisfactory. Electrically, the appliance works fine but with the coating detoriated I am no longer able to use the grill."
4,George Foreman Champ Grill,"Makes everything taste great,even inexpensive cuts of meat come out tender. Cleaning the unit is so so."
5,A champ,"It's great. Hamburgers, Steaks, Grilled Cheese Sanwiches, everything is fast and to pefection. Best gift I ever got."
3,Best friend for singles,"I've bought this so I don't have to start the grile in the winter to cook. It worked fine, but cleaning it is a pain. The food sticks to the grid. Sometimes I would have to soak it over night and clean it the next day. Other than that it's a great grill for people who live alone and don't want to cook too much, and not worry about cleaning..."
4,convenient and quick ccoking,"I really like cooking meats on this grill. No need for alot of cleanup afterwards. It cooks quickly. The size is somewhat smaller than I had thought, so I would recommend the next larger size if you're cooking for more than two people."
4,SMALL BUT GOOD!,"I've been using the GFG for about a week now. This is the best appliance that I have in the house. I've used it every day. Even my son uses it. He said to me ""Ma have you forgotten how to use the stove"". The best food I've cooked on it was Honey Mustard Chicken. It came out great. The one flaw is the cleaning but that's light stuff. ""Buy one, you'll love it"""
3,Just Okay,"Overpriced and a bit too small. But, cooks more quickly than a broiler. Surface is easy to clean but would be better if it could be taken apart and immersed."
2,Go Propane,"The thing with George Foreman, stovetop pan grills, and electric grills in general is they may put what sort of looks like 'grill,' marks on the food, but it isn't real grilling. It is fast, healthy, and you can make some good tasting stuff, but you can do the same with a non-stick pan.These things are not easy to clean. The flavor isn't there as well, so I threw mine away.It's a great idea in many ways, made George far more money than even his boxing, but I'd suggest a mini propane grill as the best compromise between electric and charcoal/wood."
4,Looks Like It'll Work Great,"I checked it out before I sent it off to my dieting Mom today! The lid seemed loose on the hinges, maybe that's the way it's supposed to be? Otherwise everything looks great. I've got a big one coming tomorow for my family...can't wait to try it out! I'm sure I'll like it since practically everybody I know, for the expection of Mom, has one and loves it!"
3,nice but hard to clean,"I like how the grill cooks chicken and beef. The problem is in the cleaning. It has a non stick surface, but the deep grooves in the surface make it very difficult to clean. You could just as easily cook with a toaster oven with a broiler pan and save the cleaning time."
1,Why do people like this crap grill?,"The grill burns the food, and it is hard to clean. The first week I got this, I cooked some chicken breasts on it, and it tasted like crap. The chicken was rubbery, not juicy or whatever Foreman claims it to be. You suck Foreman! What a waste of money.P.S. I was forced to give it 1 star, it really deserves a negative 300 stars."
4,Convenient!,"The Foreman Grill is very convenient and is able to cook chicken, steaks, hambugers, etc. quickly. It also isn't as hard to clean as some reviewers indicated. Just let it cool first. The Foreman might be a little too efficient though: don't let any meat sit unattended because it can burn a piece of meat in no time."
2,George is Over-rated,"I enjoy cooking and am drawn to new ways to cook healthy food. I found this appliance vastly over-rated. I tried chops, steak and veggies. All left me wondering who works in George's kitchen, because cleaning the thing was a pain.Took it back."
5,Great for apartments!,"I live in a small apartment and was unable to grill before I purchased this product. I use this grill all the time - for burgers, steaks, chicken breasts, sausages, and vegetables. It's easy to use and cooks foods very quickly. My only complaint is the clean up usually takes 5 minutes or so. I wish it was faster. But since when was cleaning a grill easy?"
5,"Great product, but a little too small","This grill is very easy to use and works well. It heats up quickly and is very easy to clean. The only problem is that it is really too small, even for one person. If you are going to cook a reasonable sized steak you will probably have to cut it in half and cook it a piece at a time. Also, the design of the grill means that it does not really work for bone-in steaks, as the bone prevents the upper cooking surface from making contact with 100% of the meat. However, if you stick to boneless items, you will have no problems. I use mine all the time and it is very handy."
3,"do not buy this grill, buy the new version!","I like this grill a lot but cleaning is awful. There is a new George Forman Grill out called ""George Foreman GRP99 Next Generation Grill with Removable Plates"" that will be like this grill but with removable grill plate for easy cleaning."
2,"Great idea, not-so-great implementation","The George Foreman grill works well to heat food. That's about all it does. Yes, the fat drips between the raised sections of metal. Whoop-de-doo.It will cook your burgers. It will cook your steaks and hot dogs, too. But they won't taste like they came off a real grill. They'll taste like you heated them up in a George Foreman grill, which is sterile and boring. Steaks turn ghostly white.Now for the real fun -- cleaning. You cannot immerse this thing in water. You cannot remove the grill plates for washing. You've got to wash it while it's all together. It's a mess. My roommates like to use it and ""forget"" to clean it because it's such a pain."
2,Don't Buy This !!,"This does not have removable grill plates and is a PAIN PAIN PAIN to clean !! There is just no easy way to clean this since you cannot remove the grill plates from the unit, and of course you can't get the unit wet. Spend the money to get a grill with removable plates. In addition the unit does NOT have any adjustable thermostat control so every piece of meat cooks at a high temperature which produces a *crisp* (not in a good way) outer layer with a not well done enough middle. I couldn't cut through the outer layer of the meat it was so tough !"
4,Great little grill for the quick gourmet!,"I bought this on a recommendation from a friend, who had a much larger one. I don't have to feed a family of 5, so I only needed a small one.LOVE, LOVE LOVE IT!!! Really handy, stores well, and does a great job of cooking foods quickly and with little fuss. The non-stick surface does lead to eay clean up, but be warned that some of your cleaning needs to be on the back and sides of the unit. It gets messy back there and can be difficult to clean.But, if you cook for one or two, and want something to add a different twist to your meals, you can't go wrong with this grill."
2,I don't get it...,"How can so many people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread? I bought one of these because I thought it would be cheaper, easier and more convenient than an outdoor gas grill and because some friends had told me how great it was. I've tried to cook steaks on it a few times and each time the steak comes out dry, tough, and an unappetizing gray color instead of brown, tender and juicy. And then I have to clean the darn thing, which is a pain in the butt. I don't know, maybe I'm doing something wrong?"
3,Its okay...,"I just got a George Foreman grill yesterday and I am testing the waters with it. The first thing I made was grilled cheese, which turned out pretty well, and got me excited. The next morning, I tried to make smokey links and I found the outsides got very badly burned while the insides were cooked just right. I decided to give it another chance with some marinated chicken breasts. Although the chicken was very moist and juicy, the outside was very black. Maybe if there was a lower temperature available? Clean up is very easy and aside from the outsides of things being burnt, it cooks pretty well. I guess I am just going to have to keep experimenting."
5,Small package big on TASTE!!,"My father recently died, and to my amazing discovery. The grill turned out to be one of the best finds in his home, while cleaning out his stuff. Its so compact, light, and easy too clean. It is not built for speed, however it cooks evenly and thoroughly. Since we all like to be pleased with whatever we are attemping to cook,the grill does the best job of savoring the the juices and saving the flavor. Thanks DAD!"
2,"I love to use it, but hate to clean it","I have had this for years and it is great to use. I am a college student often cooking for just myself and find it very quick and nice. My major problem is in its cleaning. People may say it is easy to clean, but it really isnt. The lid only does not completely open making the top hard to clean and the whole thing is really just a pain. I still use it, but curse it afterwards. I would reccommend getting a little more expensive model with removable plates. Trust me, for the extra money it is definitely worth it. I am looking forward to getting the new one with multiple removable plates."
1,Not all its cracked up to be!,I find that this grill is way too small. It can cook 2 burgers at a time MAX! It also was not too easy to clean. I would only recommend it to a single peron with a small appetite who loves to scrub!
4,A nice surprise,"After several people told me that I had to get this grill, I was skeptical but when I saw it on Amazon.com for under ten dollars new I figured I had nothing to lose. I was quite pleasantly surprised to find that it actually is as easy to use and clean as everyone says, and does live up to the infomercial claims. It cooks quickly and with no radiating heat you can use it in the summer without heating up your house. The only downside to this grill is that it is too small for a family meal, so I have to cook things one at a time. This isn't that big a deal most of the time however, because things like chicken and fish cook so quickly that the other serving is still warm when the second one finishes. It cleans up very easily and quickly, and takes up very little room in the cupboard because it stands vertically. If only I could cook 2 or 3 servings at a time, then it would be perfect. I guess I need to invest in the family size grill!"
2,"Convenience - YES, Taste - NO","Saw it in a local store so I picked it up. It sits on top of the waffle iron and I can hardly tell the difference between the two.I wasn't impressed with the taste of the food. It's nice to pretend you're eating healthy since 1% of the grease in that 20% fat hamburger dripped out, but guess what? The burger tastes bad. I also found grilling vegetables to be a pain. Don't expect them to cook evenly unless you chop everything to exactly the same thickness. The model I got had a timer which is a nice convenience. It doesn't look like this one has it.It's basically a frying pan that puts grill marks on your food. The food doesn't taste as good as a charcoal or gas grill and cleanup takes longer than grilling or even pan frying. So why get it? Reviewers say it makes good grilled cheese sandwiches and I might give fish the old college try but I'm pretty sure mine's going back to the store before the 30 days is up."
1,Poor quality,I received a large Forman grill last Christmas. I thought it was the greatest thing I had ever used.Within two months it was siting on my counter unused and just taking up space. The finnish was gone and the product is usless. It is almost impossible to clean after the finnish wears off. After only a few months of use it doesn't seem to be a very good product if it loses the easy clean finnish.If I could I'd certainly return the product but I have no means of doing that as it was a gift.
3,hard to clean,"even though the grill is covered with nonstick cooking surface, it's still hard to clean, especially in the corners even with the provided tool."
1,Non-stick surface?? Doesn't stick to appliance,"Product does not disclose what non-stick surface product is used. Sure would like to know so I don't buy any products with the same ""non-stick"" product. Used tools that came with the grill only (followed directions exactly) but non-stick coating soon began to come off. Will be recycling (in the garbage) an appliance costing over $100.00. I can actually take a piece that is loose and peel strips off. A suggestion, Georges and team, get a quality non-stick surface and you will have a good product. Your product costs enough that we have the right to expect that kind of quality."
1,This is NOT a champion,"I have used mine twice, once for pork chops, once for fish. I followed the directions in the little cookbook to the letter! The food was too dry and the grill was so difficult to clean that I had to put damp paper towels in it overnight in order to loosen the stuck-on food. It now occupies space on an unreachable top shelf. Someday when I have a garage sale, it will be the first item out there!"
2,Not for those who like well done meat,"I borrowed this from a friend of mine and used it for a couple of days. My husband and I are the type who like our meat well done in order to avoid all those nasty problems that can come with undercooked meat.First, we used it like instructed - simply place the chicken breast or small piece of meat on the surface, close the lid, etc. The meat cooked - on the outside. In order for the inside to get done without burning the outside, I ended up slicing the chicken breast and the beef into very thin slices, then cooking them.I also agree with the other reviers - cleaning was a pain.With all the extra time waisted, we promptly returned it to our friend and now laugh whenever we see a comerical for any of the grills.So, if you like your meat cooked, then don't buy it."
3,Too small,"... Good luck cooking a t-bone steak or even a large chicken breast on this one. Some large hamburger patties barely fit. And if you're cooking for two people, forget about it.This grill is quick, healthy and convenient, but does that stuff really matter when you can't cook the food on it? Buy the next size up."
4,a wonderful convience,"i got a george foreman grill from my dad when i moved to my first apartment. i was a little skeptical at first, but i have to say now that i've used it that the lean mean grilling machine is the easiest way in the world to cook fish. i hear from my family that it also makes the best grilled cheese sandwiches.one catch- be sure to clean it quickly, because it can be akward to clean it after the fat & fish pieces have sat on it fro a day or two."
4,Grilling again,"When my Father inadvertently killed my grill, I was truly pleased to find I could get an almost identical one to replace it. I don't need fancy bun warmers and sandwich flatteners. I just need a good, easy to use and care for, indoor grill. And George is the best. Ever since a friend told me the ONLY way to clean it, I've never looked back. (When you are finished grilling, just unplug the machine, and close it on a dampened paper towel. Go eat. When you come back to clean up, everything will be steamed, moist and easy to wipe off.)Thanks!"
4,"Quality would be a 5-Star rating (so far), but.....","it is very difficult to cook more than one burger at a time. A 6"" by 7"" cooking surface is just too small for two burgers. This definitely would have received a 5-star rating if the cooking area had been at least 8"" wide.Clean-up is easy and the fat does drain well. You might want to put a folded paper towel under the drip tray.The 'Champ' performs particularly well in grilling cheese, tomato and ham sandwiches."
5,This thing is amazing!,"My mother-in-law (of all people) bought us one of these for Christmas. We laughed together as we opened it, thinking it was kind of a silly thing; right in there with the ""Amazing Ginsu Knives."" ... ""Slices, dices and does your laundry too!""This cooker, however, is really excellent. It cooks fast, drains the fat, and leaves the meat juicy. My wife and I were both just blown away. We're not laughing any more. At this price, it is a great deal."
4,Too small,"I love George Foreman's products, but the ""Champ"" sized grill is too small for a household of more than one person, two at the most.It does a great job of cooking and FAST, it's just too little for more than 2 4 ounce burgers!Gave the Champ away to a single friend, and bought a bigger one."
2,Typical mass market junk,"I have had this for a year now. Same size, same machine. It's a hassle.Chicken has NEVER come out right. It's either over cooked or undercooked. Always tough. This presses the life out of whatever protein you've got in there.If you cook fish, it does a decent job, but guess what? The unit stinks like fish for a few weeks. It does not char the veggies as shown on TV. Rather, it softens and overcooks them. Hamburgers? Sure -- if you want the life pressed out of them. No juice! Why bother?Do yourself a favor. Skip this gimmick that made a has-been boxer a millionaire, and get yourself a Weber Go Anywhere Gas Grill - and flame cook everything you're gonna ruin in this unit."
5,George Forman Grill,This grill is excellent. Cooks fast and the food is healthier-less fat! I would recommend getting the bigger model if you have a family. You can fit about one chop or 2 burgers on the grill. Enjoy!
1,Not a good product,I've bought mine for about one year. But I just used it for three times. The food cooked were very hard and dry. Taste quite bad. I don't understand why so many people still recommend it.
3,Replacement grill very satisfactory,The grill was a replacement for one we were given several years ago and my wife enjoyed using very much. The replacement unit was delivered promptly and works equally well. My wife is pleased.
1,Couldn't return it fast enough!,"I'd heard nothing but glowing reviews of these machines, so being a self-employed, single person, it seemed it would be perfect for burgers, chicken, etc. for one person, rather than firing up the oven all the time.No on/off switch. Plugging and unplugging is a pain, burgers kept sliding down the incline, but my main complaint is the results. Maybe I got a defective unit, but everything I cooked in it was hard and crunchy on the top and dried out! I followed the instructions to the letter, and even cooked them a minute or two less than recommended, and the results were still terrible!Clean up is more of a pain than I expected. And messy. I was careful to not let the residue dry before cleaning, but even shortly after turning it off, it was more of a chore than I was led to believe.I have nothing positive to say about this appliance and will never try another one."
4,Alternative to strip or canvas covered kayaks,"There are about four books out by the same publisher on the subject of building your own kayaks. This one I read while building the one by G. Putz.In the home garage, you can make strip kayaks or covered frame boats. This particular book describes a way of boat-building that is popular in parts of Europe - stitched marine plywood. I'd never heard of this before; the practice of sewing two halves of a hull together with wire and then applying a resilient epoxy.It appears that this is an excellent way to make a kayak efficiently and with less effort than the other types. Another advantage is space on the interior for storage and leg-room which the frame boats do not afford. Also, these look NICE. Had I not started on a canvas number, I would have made one of these.Very well written, lots of detail. The author clearly has a lot of experience building these things. You could easily follow along like a cookbook's recipe - nicely done."
2,Boring!,"Good information, but very very dry. I would recommend the Bible vs. the Mormon. That was recently filmed and is very comical."
5,The Hip Girl's Handbook,"What a great guide to give a high school or college bound girl! It's informative without being ""Mom"" or ""Dad"". Enjoyed how it imparted all the common sense you need to know in one place. I would highly recommend it!"
5,Must buy !!,"This is a must buy for any young women. Whether you are heading off to college or moving out on your own. This book covers it all! Situations I would have never dreamed up are covered in this book... checking important gauges on your car for maintenance, finding a roomate, how to fix a garbage disposal, finding the right auto insurance, and balancing your checkbook are just some of the areas covered in this wonderful guide to being a woman on your own! VERY HIP!!"
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I bought this book thinking that it would be a nice guide to have after reading all the other great reviews. However, this book is not all that. Most of the stuff in it I already knew. It is a good book if you are completely clueless about this stuff, however, for those that know SOME stuff about the subjects I recommend that you pass on it and find another book."
2,a course in mathematics for students of physics,"i could hardly believe that in the chapter on linear algebra, the authors never discuss any but 2 dimensional spaces (claiming that it is easily generalized. not so!)... and the chapter on differential forms left me scratching my head... it introduces them by a taylor expansion, and claims that they are mappings, but never explains or motivates that.i found that this book covers its topics only perfunctorily, and aims to high, thinking that it is more mathematical than it actually is. i would recommend frankel instead (a slightly more advanced text, but much better written)."
1,sloppy introduction to an interesting perspective on physics,"At times, the authors can be exceedingly clear, but for the most part, they get bogged down with mathmatical conundrums which rarely trouble a physicist. The text is often slow and difficult to read, and worse than that, the text is riddled with errors. This is a shame because the differential form approach to physics is so elegant and powerful. The text should not be used as an introduction to the subject. After several revisions, the authors will hopefully mold the text into something worth using."
5,An interested amateur physicist,"I don't understand why some of the reviews here are mediocre. Although I haven't read the book to any depth, I have a knack of knowing whether a book exudes quaity by browsing briefly through it to get a general feel; the breadth of the material presented is breathtaking and at least eye-opening. Here are some reviews from the back cover...American Journal Of Physics:- Not only is the mathematics clean, elegant, and modern blah, blah, blah... This is first rate!Times Higher Education Supplement:-...There is to my knowledge no comparable book, and it is hard to imagine a more inspiring one.Remember also that there are two volumes."
4,Book Vs Movie,"This is a great book. It's a child's book, so it's an easy read with content that is meant simply to let you have a feel-good experience. Personally, I like the movie more, but having this book kind of completes it and fills you in on little info and let's me enjoy new characters and stories. If you enjoyed the movie, get this."
4,Kiki's original deliveries...,"The whole family enjoys Miyazaki's films, so when we discovered the source material for Kiki we were overjoyed. It's episodic nature made it a good read with our younger children and though it's not exactly the story the film brings you, the kids and I were excited to travel with Kiki and Jiji on some new adventures."
5,Charming Adaptation of the Movie,"I've always been a big fan of Miyazaki's movies, but the best thing about this picture-book edition of KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE is that kids who are beginning readers really enjoy it. The English version of KIKI'S has been available for several years, and kids who have seen the movie are eager to read the book, or have it read to them.The picture quality is excellent, and the text is in good English, unlike some translations I've seen.Too bad the book is hard to find. My copy has been damaged, and I wish it were easier for me to find another!"
4,First in the trilogy,It was good many years ago when I read it and the wall was a reality. It remains good even still
4,like that you are watching the documentary,"good believeable story, the characters are so real.liked the dialog.it is more than sure I will read the remaining 5 books"
4,It's the things we don't see. . .,"Bernard starts this novel as a guy heading into middle age and just seeming living his life. He's got two kids and a wife, and while things aren't perfect, they're pretty good for a someone who works in the great battle of West vs Communism. When things start to fray, things unravel quickly to the point where even the people closest to him in his life aren't to be trusted.This is the first book of this sort that I've read. Even nearly 30 years after its initial publication and knowing how things came to a crashing end in the late 80's, the mood and intrigue are still compelling. What began as a story based on what felt like long conversations between the boys turned into a tense payoff at the end. Well paced and well written, Berlin Game was an enjoyable read. I will be doing what I can to find the other two books in this set."
3,Solid Job by Author,This author always does a good job with the spy novel. This is a solid effort on his part but there really is nothing that new here. If you like the type of book and the author then this is a good place to start. Even if you are not a big fan of his this is a very solid effort. At the time this might have been more inventive but the years have given us many books with this theme.
1,Berlin Game Sucks,"Len Deighton's Berlin Game is very lame. It's the ONLY book that I stopped reading. It is boring; very boring!Best,John"
4,Gritty spy thriller,"The first book of a series of three Deighton spy thrillers, Berlin Game is a gritty spy thriller. Moving between London and Berlin, the book portarays a bitter SIS agent trying to decide who is more dangerous, the KGB or the people back in London. Written in first person, with Deighton's own distinctive flair for detail and plot, Berlin Game is a must read for thriller enthusiasts."
3,Just OK,"These socks are OK, but a bit thinner than what I wanted. Next time I would get a higher quality of sock."
1,Socks don't stay up,"These are very cute little lightweight socks, but they don't stay up. I hate it when socks crawl down your foot and end up bunched around your instep. Such a disappointment."
3,A few good tracks here,"(This same CD is also available with different cover art).Unlike some so-called salsa compilations (do a search for music on Amazon with ""hot spicy salsa"" as the keywords) this is the real thing, with actual horns (imagine that) and more-than-competent artists. If salsa isn't performed with passion there's no point in bothering. Thankfully, you get that here. While it's not the greatest salsa CD on the planet it's not a bad way to spend a few of your hard-earned bucks."
4,An odd shift in perspective,"On my first listen to this album, I found myself siding with the naysayers; I loathed it, despite liking what came before. Interestingly, however, the more I listened to it, the more it grew on me. It's now gotten to the point where it is my favorite FF album."
2,Overly original,"In its best moments, this album can exude an offbeat, musty intoxication the likes which will probably never be heard again, but in general RMC has failed conceptual ambition written all over."
1,All the others rock,"Wished I hadn't spent that amazon gift certificate on this one. This sure as hell ain't the rock n' roll of their other albums, which I suppose it's not meant to be. I'm going to pretend that this album never happened and hope that their next release blows the top off the bubbly."
5,Not Gallowsbird's Bark 2...,"...so please no more reviews lamenting that fact. I have read nothing but bad reviews of this disc, which brought to mind memories of the release of the equally maligned Blueberry Boat. Since I loved that disc i bought the new one despite the pans and was astounded at the achievement. I'm still trying to get an understanding of what is going on musically but I know that I like it very much. It is very noisy, disjointed and strange but it is also very complex, personal, and beautifully expressed. This is a band that reinvents itself with each release yet still sounds only like the Fiery Furnaces and we are lucky to have them. Do yourself a favor and see them live."
2,Wish it weren't so,"Rehearsing My Choir is worth a listen only in the sense that it is a truly original concept. I think the idea is wonderful and it deserves a certain amount of appreciation, but the sad fact is that it simply fails musically. Grandma's voice sounds like Norman Bates mom's voice, and the lyrics seem like they were family reminiscients poorly adapted to song.Maybe this album would work better accompanied by a wordless film or animation where the characters on screen acted out the stories. Think an indy rock version of R. Kelly's 'Trapped in the Closet.'"
3,Switch defective,Makes excellent perked coffee but after about six months I noticed the built in light on the switch wasn't working and thought I had a power supply problem. Further investigation found the element was working fine in the coffee maker but when checking out the switch operation heard a snapping noise like a electrical short internally. I took the bottom off to check the wiring and did find one wire falling off so reconnected but built in indicator light for switch still not working. A little nervous about using it due to electrical malfunctions and possible fire hazard. Will try and return to original store.
2,The Capone Investment- Save your money,Brought this DVD expecting a British drama of old. Found it hard going to watch - and I'm a John Thaw fan.Brought High Tide and Dangerous Knowledge at the same time - never thought I would find them so hard going.I found the acting dated (which is funny for me as I like old TV dramas and movies) in fact I fastward Dangerous Knowledge (thought it might speed up the story - wrong - And Ian McShane in High Tide well I really can't say what I think of him - Lovejoy where were you? In fact I would sell these DVD's don't think they are worth keeping.Brought them from Amazon no complaint with them they arrived ahead of the delivery date and in perfect condition.
5,Volume is Everything - Perfect for Fine Hair,"Oat Protein adds body and shine to your hair and Babassu Oil helps to restore the strength of your hair. Using this volumizing conditioner after the volumizing shampoo completes the sensory experience. The conditioner never feels heavy, although this conditioner will work very well as a shave cream.No ParabensNo Harsh Preservatives100% Vegetarian Ingredients~The Rebecca Review"
5,An Excellent Resource,"Treadwell and Alexander have written an excellent book that should be on the shelf of every manager of technical professionals. Written in a clear, readable style, the book presents practical information about how to win the labor battles we've all been witnessing. Even if the economy turns sour, attracting and retaining techies will be tough. This book is a ""secret weapon"" you can count on to help you attract - and keep - the best players."
1,Horrible,"I am a Global History and Geography Teacher. Take it from me, this is a horrible review book. It is boring and hard to read. I won't use this book and I am a teacher. This is not a good purchase. Find another review book."
3,Not the best way to go...,"I don't know why some reviewers said this book was accurate. It was filled with obvious errors in the answer key. The information was poorly organized, and many times the exact same page appeared repeatedly in different places. The actual review is pretty informative and all the information you need is there. As long as you really pay attention to what you're reading and are able to pick up on the errors, you should be alright. If you don't though, and blindly accept their answers (despite the fact they they plainly contradict the text) you'll end up very confused and very mistaken. My friends ordered the Prentice Hall review book (straight from their website, I don't think Amazon sells it) and they seemed to like that better."
3,too late,"the book took three weeks to get here when it was supposed to be here in 9 days. by the time the book got here, it was after the exam."
5,Much needed addition,This warming tray makes meals much easier to prepare - no longer worrying about keeping one thing warm while another finishes cooking. Not quite sure how we did without one for so long. One very nice additional feature of the Maxim warming tray is that it has the hot spot on it which keeps things 40 degrees warmer - very nice to have.
2,"missing unlisted track, The Dent County Tick and Snake Market Report","I love the album and give it 5 stars. The mp3 download sold by Amazon is missing the unlisted track, ""The Dent County Tick and Snake Market Report"". I could kick myself for having lost my original CD and having to settle for the mp3."
5,To Be Me: Understanding What its like to have Aspergers,"This is a wonderful book for parents, siblings, friends and family, but especially for my son who was recently diagnosed with Asperger's. This book helped him to feel like he was not strange and that there are other kid's just like him. We are very happy to have this book. I would highly recommend it!"
4,milk does you good,"Since his audio two days milk will always be never dated. Sampled alot, and now this solo effort I dig it alot. Strong hip hop roots and a good run with the beasties Mike D."
1,Do Not Buy!,"I have owed this unit for over a year now. I bought it at Target and I have had problems from day one. The unit rejects most blank DVD-Rs, DVD+Rs, DVD-DLs when trying to record. It is so frusterating! One out of 10 attempts it will finally work. Maybe I have a lemon but from reading the other reviews it seems this unit should be retired to the ash heap!"
1,Two Bad Recommendations,I bought this machine several months ago. My daughter has the same unit. The VCR section died on her's within three months. The DVD recorder / player on mine died within three months.Same problem on both: rejects the media. This includes any and all disks on my unit. Try something else!
1,VERY unrrliable,"I've had one of these for a number of years. The only reason I've kept it so long is because I have a warranty on it. I've actually used the warranty about six times so far. I have to keep bringing it back to replace the laser. Apparently, they didn't mean for people to actually use this dvd recorder. I think if you burn more than fifty DVDs, the machine is shot. That's been my experience so far, anyway."
1,"unreliable, stops reading new discs, poor audio sync.","Yes, it's a great price for the refurbs from Samsung, and they have a good feature set, but I bought two 330s and they both died after three months. Even when they were working, the sound was often out of sync with the video. You will find other reports of this. It's most annoying (though not shocking) that TigerDirect sales people claim to have no knowledge of these problems... ""first I heard of it""...But the worst part is that soon after I got them, around 3 months after getting them, they stopped being able to read new or un-finalized discs. I use Verbatim 8x DVD-R.I suggest that you read carefully the terms of any extended warranty policy before shelling out any more money.Too bad"
1,"Great at first, but one of our two units stopped working quickly","We have two of these units. One continues to work most of the time, though occasionally it won't play DVDs that play fine in our Philips DVD player; the other Samsung that we bought at the same time will often not play out-of-the-box DVDs that play fine in the other unit. Some of the DVDs we have recorded do not play elsewhere, and the unit that has problems playing DVDs also can't be relied on to record something that can be played back later."
2,Not made for heavy use,"I purchased this unit to copy vhs tapes to dvd. For the most part it worked well, with occasional disc errors, etc., but the errors overtime do become more frequent until the unit is no longer reliable, and you're wasting a lot of dvds. All in all, I got about 2 years out of it, which isn't that bad for the price. I'm still looking for a really well built and reliable dvd recorder, and from all the reviews I've read about various models and manufacturers they all have their quirks. Even the high end models have bad reviews."
1,"This product Doesn't Work, Don't buy it!","There is a 1/2 second delay between the picture and sound for all DVDs burned with this machine. My unit has been back to their repair shop 4 times. Two of those times they sent me refurbished units that also had the same defect. Each time, they have kept my machine for two-three months and then sent it back to me un-repaired. Their customer service is just playing games with me. I am no longer going to purchase Samsung products."
1,Same problems: spits out discs after warranty expires,"We originally had an older DVD Recorder/VCR combo player from Samsung very similar to this one, but we sent it in to be replaced after it stopped reading discs and just rejected them. They gave us this unit as a replacement, and it worked fine for a few months, but then the same problem showed up. Now, every time you put in a disc, blank or not, it starts to load, then right before it actually starts playing it spits it out. DO NOT BUY THIS. Samsung's support is terrible and denies that the problems exist. The problems usually start soon after the warranty expires, so you'll have to spend another $60-$100 just to fix it until it breaks again."
2,IF YOU CAN FIND ANOTHER BRAND TRY IT!,"When I bought this item, it was on sale, which was one of the major reasons I bought it. It was really being sold at a great discount, but with all that it was not worth keeping. I was very glad to return this item, and I returned it. One observation was in copying scenes. The product freezes and that's what gets recorded, frozen image that lasts about five seconds on your recording. This was a major reason for the return. I also did not like the design of the item, it wasn't the latest design on the market."
5,GREAT MOVIE!!!,This movie is hilarious! John C. Rilley is a GREAT actor and has such a beautiful voice! This is a must have DVD! Make sure to purchase the soundtrack also! And check out John C. Rilley's performance in Chicago also!
4,One of the better movies ive seen of late,"John C Riley stars as Dewey Cox, a fictional take on Johnny Cash's Walk The Line. The movie does have a few good laughs but what really steals the film is the songs. Riley does a outstanding job as a singer and I hope he does more musical films. I liked the song Walk Hard and Lets Duet, one of the funniest songs ive heard in a long time. The part with The Beatles were awesome and I loved his take on Bob Dylan songs. I highly recommend this to fans of This Is Spinal Tap or A Mighty Wind. Its a good comedy on its own and ive yet to watch the unrated version."
3,John C.Reilly - Coming Into His Own,"I remember seeing the commercials for this movie and I really didn't think it would be that good. I figured I would go ahead and buy it since it's been slow going with movies lately. I was pleasantly surprised and laughed most of the movie. John C. Reilly is really becoming a good character. I have got to mention the close penis shots, I could do without."
2,"Parody on ""Walk The Line"" movie","From the very (silly) start of the movie you know you are in for the goofy fun. John C. Riley gives wonderful performance as a main character Dewey Cox in the movie that is sometime funny, sometimes offensive and filled with stars from start to finish. Cast includes most of the comedians from the Saturday Night Live show and in addition to that Jack Black, Lyle Lovett, Paul Rudd, Jason Schwartzman to name a few. They all give fantastic performances in a movie that is making fun of Johnny Cash, Beatles, Elvis Presley and pretty much the entire music industry. I am not sure if John C. Rilley did his own singing in this movie, but if he did, he has a great voice that matches his acting abilities (I have a great respect for this actor). If you watch this film, be ready for the night of fun poking and superficial laughter."
5,One of the funniest movies I've ever seen!,"My husband and I are amazed that this film didn't do well at the box office, but hopefully it'll net a bundle in rentals....well-written, fast-paced, hilarious script, and John C. Reilly is simply fantastic as Dewey Cox, his acting as always is outstanding, and here he's finally allowed to show his full singing chops too (which I heard an inkling of in his performance in ""Chicago""). Tim Meadows is great, and also Paul Rudd's impersonation of John Lennon, in a small part is outstanding. Love it!"
3,More silly than funny,"The Bottom Line:Walk Hard has its share of amusing scenes--chief among them when Dewey goes through a Dylan stage and when he hangs out with the Beatles--but it also parades a lot of stupid moments in front of the audience that it thinks are hilarious (a guy's genitalia appears in the top of the screen! How inspired!) and quickly wears out its welcome with a skewed ratio of dumb to funny; spoofs are hard movies to make well, even for Apatow and co.2.5/4"
4,A Funny Movie,"""Walk Hard"" is not ""Ha! Ha!"" funny. It is however cleverly funny, which is good enough for me. The film makes fun of every part of the lives of musicians. Drugs, break-ups, divorces, family issues are all poked fun at in a campy way which make the film very fast-paced almost like a ""Scary Movie"" film. But because of the films context and John C. Reilly's fantastically silly acting, the film just works in its own right as a deviously entertaining film.Bottom line facts: The songs are hysterical. For the guys, adorable Jenna Fischer, Pam Beesly, from the Office is in it. In a great Beatle reference; Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Justin Long, Jason Schwartzman are the uncredited Beatles in the film. There are hassidic record moguls. And lastly is the tear jerking song at the end of the film."
3,Reilly is always watchable,Above average spoof. Spotting the other actors in disquise is fun. Reilly is still waiting for the star vehicle he deserves. And the music ain't half bad.
1,Falling Down Hard!!!,"I have always been a big fan of movies that feature good music: Eddie and the Cruisers, Almost Famous, Doing That Thing You Do, Pirate Radio. I love the movies that feature soundtracks of classic oldies, like American Graffiti. I should have noticed the ""credits"" (embarrassments) on the box before buying this one (40-year-old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, c'mon!!!)This movie is a let-down from every angle. The jokes are not funny, the music is not listenable, the acting is terrible, the sex scenes are revolting. It's not a comedy, not a drama, not a history, and too vulgar for family viewing. I bought it used at FYE, and, as usual, they won't buy the crap that they sell back. Oh, well, I have a two-disc dvd case for something else, along with a couple of frisbees for my dog. This is a pure piece of worthless trash, and, while I don't like to waste my time writing these reviews, I thought I might save someone else a few dollars."
5,Cult classic made even better,"Walk Hard gets funnier every time I watch it, and for that I will always be happy I own it myself. My wife and I enjoy it at least once a month and it is wickedly ridiculous.However, what sets the Blue-Ray apart is the phenomenal special features that range from insane to hilarious to interesting. I highly recommend the BD over the standard edition and recommend the movie to anyone who can see the brilliance in ridiculous satire."
4,Funny Movie,"This is a pretty good movie, with its share of funny moments. There is alot of Nudity and cussing if your not a fan of either, then stay away from this movie, as for me, it doesn't bother me."
3,Reilly and Fischer are very Funny..,"Reilly is pretty funny, and Fischer(Pam from the Office) But the movie could be a little offensive especially for Johnny Cash Fans(Although I am, I look at it differently,also this movie pokes fun at music biopics in general)I didn't think the whole cutting in half was funny. I Did love how when ever he gets mad in the movie he rips off a sink! lol. also the usual Apatow Crew of friends shows up(Minus Ferrell,The Beatles Part was the Funniest.Overall I thought it was funny."
1,NOT FUNNY,"This movie is not funny or entertaining. John C. Reilly can be compared with Will Ferrell, who also is NOT FUNNY. This is just plain STUPID."
4,"""How do you follow THAT?""","Easily the funniest film i've seen since ""Anchorman"".John C Reilly is simply awesome in a role that no other actor I can think of could pull off.Sure some of the gags don't quite hit the mark but I haven't laughed out loud so often in a long time.The music is superbly done with every genre delivered in hilarious fashion.The UK Comic Strip did a spoof well before ""Spinal Tap"" came out about a metal band called ""Bad News"".Its no small tribute to say this is as good.People who trash it probably think Jerry Seinfeld is ""witty""."
5,Great Music and funny,"I rate this movie highly as it is funny and satirical and the original music is well done. This movie has a glaring fault though... a hotel room scene with male nudity that obviously was put in to shock, but is just tasteless and unfortunately limits who I could recommend this movie to.Make a version available without that scene and associated clip in the credits so families can laugh and enjoy this well done parody. Just my suggestion."
2,If you like STUPID humor.....,"This wasn't quite the movie I expected, however if you like dumb funny then this is a great flick for you."
2,Could have been A LOT better,"After reading many of the reviews posted here, I decided to rent ""Walk Hard. Big mistake. I hardly laughed at all and I didn't even finish watching it because I fell asleep. Do not rent this movie. It's not worth the $3.99 I paid for it."
3,Fantastic Movie If Your Looking For Fun And Laughs,"If you liked Walk the Line, you may want to steer clear of this movie, because you might be offended by the fact that they are parody-ing the life of Johnny Cash and other rags-to-riches performers. However, if you have a bit of a twisted sense of humor, and like John C Reilly, then this movie is amazing. I watched it in the theaters, then rented it to show to friends twice, and finally bought my own copy, which I showed to several more people because I was so impressed with the wit and energy of the movie. The songs are hilarious, and Tim Meadows is excellent in his supporting role. I'll Walk as Da*n Hard As I Please!"
4,Crazy Funny,"When this movie started playing, I groaned to myself. I didn't think I would be able to watch it. I don't tend to go for stupid comedy, but it soon won me over. If you liked Walk the Line (the Johnny Cash story featuring Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon which was excellent), this will have you howling with laughter. It takes that basic story line and completely obliterates it with lunacy. It's so stupid that you just have to laugh. It starts to lag when Dewey meets the Beatles. That part wasn't in Walk the Line and I didn't think it added to the story. When it wraps, you feel good both from having laughed so hard and also because the ending is sweet. Reilly is excellent as is the rest of the cast."
3,One Stupid Movie,"Never gets off the ground as a comedy, or anything else. Just kind of a waste of time. Very forgettable and just like the other movies ie; The Ballad of Rickie Bobby, etc"
1,Waste of time...,"This movie has made it onto my All Time Worst Movies list. Please do not rent this movie much less buy it. The beginning childhood flashback opener isn't even remotely funny. In fact the rest of the movie isn't either. Still, I like many others somehow fell prey to the lure of a funny movie. I had the pleasure of seeing Walk the Line which is a really great movie. This movie follows the same story line but in the worst way ever, the jokes are flat, the innuendos are lame and who wants to see flaccid male penis right in your living room??? I just hope I can save someone from making a horrible mistake by watching this movie. Even my boyfriend, whom loves the same programs as I like Family Guy, was left scratching his head wondering what type of person could possibly find this movie funny."
1,Horrible Movie,"I can't believe this movie was even allowed to be made. If I was Johhny Cash's family, I would sue. His brother was tragically killed by being pulled into a table saw, was almost cut in half, and suffered for a week before dying. This is a sick movie and anyone who knows about his brother and still thinks it's funny is sick. The people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves. What goes around comes around. I would give this movie a zero if I could."
1,This movie REALLY STINKS---not funny at all~,"I rented this movie, it was a COMPLETE waste of a free rental for sure! The only positive was I didn't actually waste my money renting it!!! The movie isn't funny at all! It tries to rely on nude male genitals to get a laugh (for instance). John C. Reilly isn't a good enough actor to support a lead role either, it was like a ""Will Ferrell"" wannabe effort. It was painful to watch and I finally had to turn it off.....It was in poor taste, as it made a mockery of tragic events in Johnny Cash's life...his brother's death for one. How this movie racked up 4 STARS on Amazon is disheartening to say the least...Sorry, I didn't laugh so hard my face hurt....My FACE HURT, but not from laughing...It was disappointing too to see some cast members from ""THE OFFICE"" in this movie! This movie is moronic to say the very least...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THE BOMB!!!!"
1,Stinker!,"It was awful. I went into it with great hopes expecting to enjoy it. I wanted to like it, I wanted to laugh. I spent more time rolling my eyes and checking the counter to see how much time was left till it was over. I was so disappointed."
2,I thought these were great.....,"They work very well and all goes well until you try to remove them. Nothing packs well, so all the ""dirt"" falls apart. Also, if you wait too long, the roots come out the bottom and you cannot get it out. A better alternative are the Peat planters. They are bigger and much better. You can plant them directly into the ground. No hassle, no mess! Try cutting the sides of this to get everything out and you will see the mess you create. Pass on this and get the Peat planters."
2,They only sent half the order,"Just received the cubes and have no idea if they will work or not. However, Hurt only sent 36 cubes and not the 72 specified. Even after I replied to their confirmation email (which listed 36), informing them of the error and even included a link to this website. Still, I give the produce 2 stars in the hope that the cubes are not as bad as their customer service"
3,Standard Jack Vance,"If you like the writings of Jack Vance, you will doubtlessly like, not love, this novel.As Jack Vance wrote in the introduction, he had stopped writing and had a lot of things left over,so he added this sequel. The story is the standard, Jack Vance mix of parables, and intrepid heroes,evil-doers, strange cultures that are a mask for our own cultures, with hair-breathe escapes, and adventures.A good read, if you like Vance. He seems to use space travel as a metaphor for the journey that is life, becauseif not, everyone the characters left behind would have died out because they would have to be traveling at the speed of light necessary to reach distant planets and then return back from when they left."
5,sparkling entertainment,"Vance modestly describes this book as containing the left-over material from Ports of Call. The stories are not new to a reader of Vance - a hunt for a sex criminal, a foolish religious sect, a dramatic performance that goes wrong, these we have seen before.What delights about this book, however, what prompts me to give it five stars, is the language. Vance has always been known for his startling turns of phrase, his carved and graven prose, but this is the best and most consistent example of it that I can remember seeing. Where in previous books the wit came in flashes, here I saw the full illuminations."
4,Instruction Manual,"A guide to Ceili, set and country dancing. Includes instructions for over 50 dances; such as, Aran set, Castle set, Four hand reel, Eight Hand Jig, Plain Polka set."
3,yikes...,"as a competition irish dancer, i thought this book stunk. but i'm sure it was good from anyone elses point of view. i thought that more dances should be shown for the more advanced student...and if anyone knows of an advanced level irish dance book, let me know"
5,"""A faker with no respect for the underground""<-------????????? these are the words of an idiot","If you're here looking for Rodan <--------1the monsta island czarthen you already know Rodan <--------2is one of the most gifted lyrisist in the rap gamesome idiot wrote below that Rodan sounded like a bad RBL or something.....???!!yeah right....and this kid said rodan was biting some rock bands name....?????I'd like to fight this person nowIf you listen to some stupid ""indie"" rock or whatever then don't even bother with Rodanhe wouldn't make sence to youfor those of you that appreciate quality hip hoplet me excuse this reviewer of which I speakfor saying things that hold no real insight""a faker with no respect for the underground""is a good description of the person who said this of RODAN.RODANis a REAL<-- rapper FROM<--- the UNDERGROUND<-- hip-hop sceneof a stagnated NYC...!!!!!!!!! M.I.C. 4ever....!!!!!!!!BY THE TIME IT'S OVER NO SNAKES ALIVE"
1,Misleading product description,"The dimensions of this ""large"" ring in the Product Description are incorrect/misleading! It states in the listing Product Dimensions: 17.4 x 1.4 x 14.5 inches so you would think that 17.4 would be the external diameter and 14.5 would be the internal diameter and this is not the case! You would definitely assume such as the picture also shows the ring as round but when I received the ring it was smashed down into an oval as tightly as it could be. In this shape the dimension was close to 17 inches in the long direction but in this shape you would be lucky to fit a finch in the ring. Once you pull this out into a round ring like in the picture the dimensions are 13.5 external diameter and 11 internal diameter. This is a good 3 to 4 inch difference than what is advertised and makes a big difference when you have large birds like Macaws. I am not happy with the misleading product description!"
4,My African Grey LOVES It !!!,"My African Grey parrot loves swings and this one tops the others we have tried. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 starts is that the first swing only lasted about 2 weeks before she chewed through the rope. But the second is lasting a bit longer, and as long as the price stays reasonable, we can afford to order her a replacement when need. She uses the swing constantly and even says""weeeee"" when she is on it, which is so cute."
5,Happy Swing!,"I bought this swing for my young very animated canary, Makana. He really liked his smaller wooden swing, although when he lands on it, it swings wildly. He only stays on it a few seconds before he jumps off of it. I wanted him to have an alternative swing of different texture and form. So I got the small Booda swing.Makana loves his Booda swing! He was fascinated with it as soon as I hung it in his cage. He pecked at it and went around and around looking at it from different sides. Finally he jumped on it and it has been his favorite perch ever since. He sleeps and plays on it and pecks and pulls at the strings. When he lands on it, it only sways a little for a gentle rocking sensation and he seems to like that.I am setting up a much larger flight cage for him, so I will likely get another one or two of these Booda swings for that cage."
5,Exactly what my bird needed,"The medium size was a little bigger than I expected, but still a good size for a cockatiel. And it just so happens that this swing has become my cockatiels favorite place to perch. He naps on it, climbs around on the outside, or pulls on it just to watch it swing back and forth. I'd definitely recommend this product to my fellow bird owners."
3,"Very pretty, but dull stones","These are lovely earrings that look far more expensive than they are ... except for the ""Blue CZ"" stones. They look and feel just like plastic. It's a terrible detriment to the set. I may have to have them replaced by a jeweler (if I can) in order for them to be appropriate for my brother-in-law's wedding. However, they look good enough that I'm looking for a matching necklace."
5,Stops Dandruff and Cleans Hair Without Strange Sensations,"A few years ago, when I started noticing a dandruff problem, I began using Denorex shampoo (the coal-tar formula). The Denorex definitely solved the dandruff problem, but I was never really comfortable with the tingling sensation it produced and the fact that it didn't seem to get my hair as clean as I wished (still leaving ""greasy"" hair after showering).So, on one trip to my local department store, I picked up a bottle of Head & Shoulders Dandruff Shampoo: Classic Clean, and have never wavered from it. Not only does this product completely eliminate my dandruff, but it also leaves my hair feeling light and clean without any strange tingling sensations.I cannot vouch for any of Head and Shoulders' other formulas, but I can say that the Classic Clean is wonderful for me. If you are struggling with Dandruff and don't like the idea of a product as powerful as Denorex on your head every day, give this shampoo a try."
4,still my favorite,"Head & Shoulders is still my favorite dandruff shampoo, as to price and results; some dandruff shampoos may work better, but they cost up to three times as much."
4,Not sure,"I read this book, and inspite it all, I still have lots of questions of this ordeal. I think anyone should read it and decide for themselves. It is hard to believe something like this happend involving a very well known celebrity. But that's the world for ya!"
5,Amazing Range!,"I bought this CD in Japan and was very glad to see it available here. Devon Sinclair has a simply amazing voice. She must have about a 4-octave range. But unlike some Divas who have released jazz albums, Devon has a real feel for the music. Her phrasing is impeccable, and she can make her voice either soft or strong, haunting or powerful, depending on how best to express the mood and emotion of the song. She really feels this music - and expresses it with her voice. I just loved it. I can't wait for her to release another album.Something about me to gauge my tastes and yours: I tend to like traditional jazz - for me the old time singers were the best - Sarah Vaugh and Ella Fitzgerald have no peers. Of modern jazz singers, I think Jane Monheit, Paula West and Jeannie Bryson stand out."
5,Devon Sinclair,I had the very good fortune to find this CD in the Sale Bin at my local Hastings - and I have never stopped being glad that I tried it out. I Love her voice and her renditions of every single song. I only wish that I could find more of her music; her title is a perfect fit for the selection of music and for the love of singing that comes through with her work.
3,OK,"When compared to CD's like the Virgil Fox Legacy Volume III and Fred Swann's ""Hymns on the Crystal Cathedral Organ"", this CD is unfortunately rather boring. The organ is small, uninteresting, and wasn't even worth including a stop list for, it seems. The playing is rather sterile also, not adding modulations, mutations, or registration changes where Virgil or Swann would have been going to town. Overall, worth a listen, but not the purchase."
1,What a mess!,"The lid is to darn tight and after a lengthy struggle it finally popped off sending hot coffee and grinds all over me and the kitchen wall, counter, and floor. I dumped the pot, replaced the lid and had my husband try to open it and the same thing happened. Am returning this item."
2,I love percolated coffee,"I loved the way my coffee tasted when brewed in the Melitta percolater. About the only thing I would change is the plastic bubble on the top of the lid. I've had two break apart on me. Since I cannot find replacement parts, I've had to replace the entire pot."
3,"nice, but...","At first I was thrilled with this percolator - it made fantastic coffee (Gevalia is the best in this, by the way) and we really were enjoying it. BUT, now we have had it for only 3 weeks and the water level gauge on the handle is not working right - I had filled the pot to the brim with water, and the gauge said it was only half full! Other times, the gauge will read that the pot had 8 cups of water in it - when in reality the thing is empty! FRUSTRATING!"
1,NOT WHAT I WANTED!,The bottle that i received in the mail is not the one in the picture! i was very disappointed! i called the company and they admitted that it was not the same and said they did not even carry the one in the picture! Will not order from this company again!
3,Good Coverage; But...,"quite out-of-date unfortunately... Especially on the coverage on switched-capacitor circuit techniques. Do not choose this book if you want to design modern analog/mixed-signal circuits, for instance, sigma delta modulators or low voltage (lower than 3.3 V) switched-capacitor circuits."
1,Not very happy.,"This book is fine, the content is good and helpful for the class; however, whoever sold it to me tore out a BUNCH OF PAGES. chapter 5, a good amount of chapter 13, is gone. (probably more that I havent gotten to yet. so if that person is reading this, just know that I'm not happy. The book doesn't do me too much good when I don't have half the pages... So thanks for making me pay like 50 bucks for a book that sucks and doesnt help me with the class!!! I find myself struggling all the time. Hope you don't do this next time."
1,"worked good for only a couple of months, then steam started escaping","I spoke with Salton, Inc. who said it was out of warranty (1 year), but I could buy a replacement lid for a mere $10 + taxes + shipping! I'll buy a different model somewhere else, thanks."
2,Not quite up to par,"I had been using a Krups Espresso maker for several years, when the pressure safety valve let go, and it stopped making coffee. I looked at the prices for a new Krups, and decided that I could not afford to replace it with a like model.The price for the Melita was within my budget, and the features are similar. However, it is precisely these features that made the Krups unit desireable.The less than desireable features of the Melita are:- steam leaks around the basket- steaming tube openning is too large to make good foam- unit must be switched off when changing from ""brew"" to ""steam""In sum, I must say Caveat Emptor - Let the buyer beware."
1,Short Haul Machine,"I was looking for something within my price range and came across the Melitta MEXKITB with cups, saucers and frothing pitcher. There wasn't any coffee included and the booklet wasn't what was advertised or pictured on the box. It only had one page on Brewing Tips (not instructions) and the rest is a dessert recipe book. It is up to you to figure out how this machine works. Pretty much a no brainer, but...... I have to admit it worked well while it was working. It only took it one month and one week to quit and I'm now looking at machines recommended by experienced espresso people. I'm glad I bought a stainless steel stovetop espresso maker for a backup."
1,You get what you pay for,"I bought this espresso maker about a year ago. It was thecheapest one I could find and price was the only basis for mydecision. However, you get what you pay for. It worked fine forseveral months, but two months ago, steam started escaping out fromunder the tightly screwed on lid. Finally last week, it exploded andthe steam spout shot clear across my kitchen. END"
4,Good machine for the money,"Considering the price, the Melitta Espresso machine is a good value. It's not for heavy use though. Rubber seal keeps coming loose on my model and I have to make sure the lid is tight securely.Over all I'm happy with my purchase"
1,Not really useful for anyone but a complete newcomer...,"The back cover of this book states that it covers advanced information on Cisco router configuration. I guess advanced is a relative term for the authors. Unless you are a complete newcomer to the networking field, skip this one... One more thing. I wish publishers would stop using ""padding"" and ""fillers"" to fool the reader that the book is more valuable than it really is... I find it to be quite insulting."
5,excellent product..,I bought this clock two years ago as a gift and my wife is still happy with it... no complains..
5,This book is a tribute to all mothers and daughters,"This book is special to me because my Great Grandmother and her daughters (as well as my grandmother who raised me) are in the book. My ""Granny"" will be 100 years old in 1999 and has been an inspiration to us all. I've often thought her story should be told and while this is a very short version among many I was pleased with the gentle way they captured her essence."
5,Wonderful Warming Tray,"This is a wonderful warming tray!!! It fits several different dishes and frees up your oven if you need to reheat several different items. There are different settings depening on how hot you want to keep things but the sides and bottom stay cool. I actually bought a second smaller one and used both on my Thanksgiving buffet for all of the side dishes and also used it to keep hors d'hourves hot at my husbands birthday. When people went back for seconds the food was still nice and hot! If you are a big entertainer, this is a MUST have! Oh... It is easy to clean which is a bonus too."
2,The Official Blackbood Price Guide to World Coins,"It says all countries are listed, yet they are not. And those that are listed do not have all their coins. I found only one or two of the twenty or so I was looking for."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this game. From the time I put it on my visor, things did not work correctly. In trying to play the games, it would not always show the aces after you placed them so you were left guessing which suites were what. Movement was erratic and I repeatedly got error messages. When it started crashing my visor........I removed it."
5,Excellent overview,"This book is an excellent overview of British history prior to 1950 or so. Think of it as a combination ""British history for dummies"" and detailed time-line of events and literature. Literature and history are undeniably intertwined in real life, and this book reflects that remarkably well. It does talk about literature in detail, but this book is probably better for history buffs or as a companion to a literature book."
1,Rent if you must - don't buy,"Really slow and dull. Might possibly appeal to the older lesbians with family sector of the community - aside from that you're going to be tempted to switch this one off halfway through. I bought this one without reading the reviews properly, a compulsive buy based on an Amazon suggest-sell recommendation based on my lesbian tv/movie binge with the $AU riding high. Don't make the same mistake as I did!"
5,I read all by Lori Foster and this was a good one,"I got this book for Lori Foster's story and it ended up that I liked all of the stories here. Lori's was the best, but all were very good. I like these collections because I find new writers to try and enjoy. Hopefully there will be another of these Bad Boy collections soon."
4,great portable cookware,"not only can you bake a pizza, you can make cookies, warm bread slices etc. very sturdy and a good buy. good for doing demos at expos and in-store demos. highly recommended for college students living in dorms."
5,Great Pizza Maker!,"I purchased this pizza maker several years ago from QVC as a Cook's Essentials product. It makes geat pizza from fresh dough. Recently I have used it for frozen self rising pizza to keep kitchen temperatures down during the hot summer months. Wow! It really does a great job, nothing sticks and cleanup is very easy. I was surprised to see this product still available.I highly recommend this product."
3,Donglin and Today,"Dardess's book on the Donglin Faction, a super-Confucius group within the Chinese government from 1625-1627, was subject to one of the most brutal oppressions in China's history. Dardess provides excellent examples of torture, repression, and generally nasty stuff that befell the highly moral Donglins.Dardess uses the example of the government's treatment of the Donglin as a parallel to the treatment of the protestors in Tiananmen Square in 1989. Basically, he devotes the last chapter to this theory. An interesting theory that I think Dardess proves fairly well. The incident at Tiananmen Square is not an isolated event. It can be traced to the continued repression of democracy and transparency of the Chinese communist government over the years. Similarly, Dardess argues that repression of the Donglin Faction too stems from a parallel issue, though with a much more moral bent. Overall it is an interesting, if dry, read."
5,a beautiful book,"This is a book meant to be read and reread, savored, and it's spiritual exercises internalized. I would like to offer my most heartfelt thanks to Jamal Rahman for this work. It is deeply spiritual, yet light and humourous at the same time. I am unable to adequately explain to the few friends who are curious to know why, at this stage in my life I have converted to Islam as a basis for my interest in and practices of Sufism. This is the book I intend to give them. I lent it to my daughter and she asked to keep it; I will need a few more copies."
4,RBD topping the Billboard Charts!!!!!!!!!,"Yes, RBD has sold more than 100, 1000 copies in the U.S. and now they are in #6 in Billboard, and maybe they could get to #1 soon. This album it's OK! Not so good not that bad but if you like the soap opera Rebelde you should buy it!Standout Tracks: Rebelde; Otro dia que va; Salvame and the fan's fav. Solo quedate en silencio"
5,You are the Best,You're are number one and the bested singing of all the singers and i hope every thing come out 4 all of you good stuff and i be waiting for the next cd that come outalways troublemaker
1,....,Do you call this music?? C'mon...and you call yourself wise people...A esto le llaman musica?? y se hacen llamar gente sabiaSUCKS
5,rebelde is AMAZING!,"me encanta rebelde. i worked as a volunteer promoting health this summer in a super small village outside of Guanajuato, Mexico and every single girl, no matter what age, was in LOVE with rebelde. We would literally SPRINT home to watch the tela novela! They are unbelievably popular in Mexico and i bought a pirated CD in a market one day in San Poncho and i've been listening to it non-stop since i've been home (5 months ago). It's the best CD ever and even if you dont speak the language you'll pick up the lyrics super fast. FREAKING AWESOME!"
5,FUEGO!,I've listened to the tracks and i wonder if it is possible to buy fuego as a single? I just love RBD!
5,THIS SOUNDTRACK ROCKS!!,"I USUALLY DONT WATCH NOVELAS BUT THIS ONE IS THE BEST EVER, AND THE SOUNDTRACK IS EVEN BETTER, I NEVER GET TIRED OF LISTEN IT.. I LIKE THE WHOLE 11 SONGS .. I RECOGNIZE THE GUYS FROM RBD ARE NOT THE BEST SINGERS IN THE WORLD, BUT THE SONGS SOUND REALLY GOOD, BELIEVE ME IF YOU GET THIS CD YOU ARE NOT GONNA REGREAT IT.."
3,"acceptable, not terrific","Works fine, with a couple of caveats.1) tea builds up and gets pretty grungy and hard to remove, and the surfaces are not easy to get at to scrub2) sometimes the drip hole gets clogged or mis-aligned, and the tea doesn't drip into the pitcher, instead it overflows in the topThis is the 1st tea maker I've owned. I use it most every day.Next time I buy one, I might just buy a coffee maker instead. I don't see a difference."
3,Works Good,"It is a little cheap looking but it does the job. I'm not sure how long it will last. But for know it works really well, however, if you don't set it up just right it will overflow."
2,GREAT ICE TEA MAKER,I REALLY LIKE THIS ICE TEA MAKER....SO MUCH I BOUGHT ONE FOR A GIFT AND SHE LIKES IT TOO!
5,Salton Ice Tea Maker,The machine works beautifully and it was a bargain at the Amazon price. I would highly recommend to anyone and it works much better than the Mr. Coffee iced tea maker that I had for many years.
4,Salton Tea Maker,"This tea maker makes delicous tea. The unit is light-weight and the price was great. Our only complaint with it is the security of the basket (filter/teabag holder). Even though I lock it as it says, if I don't position the pitcher just right under the basket where the spring is, the basket can fill with tea and overflow. I usually have to check it and move it as necessary and even re-lock the basket to prevent this from happening."
4,Goodbye Mr. Coffee,"After using the Mr. Coffee Ice Tea machine for about 10 years and getting tired of buying new pitchers I decided to change to the Salton. I read many reviews by other customers so I thought I should give it a try. Glad I did. The feature I like the best is that you do not have to remove a hot top to add new water for the next batch, just lift the top like a coffee machine. I also like the fact that the tea comes from the top and not the spout so less mess and seems to fit better than the Mr. Coffee machine. The only thing I would like is a 3 liter pitcher instead of 2 since I make quite a bit at one time. So far it is too new to say if in the long run I will like this machine better, but so far, so good."
1,Forget what (the) reviewer says - don't buy this!,"When I used this for the 1st (and only) time, I found it noisyand slow. The pitcher doesn't fit snugly into the well, and when youremove it, instead of turning off the flow of tea (as advertised), it makes it flow heavier (which ends up in a mess). When I tried to clean it I found that a difficult task because the filter cup has ridges from edge to center, every inch all the way around. The reservoir got tea in it, and it's so narrow, you can't get in there with a sponge to clean it. When I tried to rise it out, tea flowed out from somewhere, and went all over the place (if I hadn't tipped it, the tea would have dried inside and ended up moldy). Don't waste your money like I did. Boil water, that's all this does. END"
1,Don't waste your money or your time,"I bought this iced tea maker because a friend had a similar model from a different manufacturer. Thinking they were all similar I bought this one. I was wrong.This machine uses a spring-mounted lever that activates the flow of brewed tea into the pitcher, once the pitcher is placed in it's proper place. No matter how I placed the pitcher (even exactly as the manual instructs), the spring-mounted lever would open the valve only halfway (or not at all), leading the pot to fill with hot tea that spilled out of the top and flooded my kitchen. After two months of this, I threw it out.This product's design is simply flawed. I think the idea of iced tea makers is great, but this execution of it, with the spring-mounted lever valve, simply does not work. Look into another brand if you are thinking of purchasing an iced tea maker."
2,Pros and Cons of this Purchase,It is small and compact I like the design and features that's why I purchased it as a gift. It is a little smaller than I prefer actually and the overflow problem was very messy I was going to send it back or throw it agains a wall then the spring popped out. Now it works no overflow problem it fits better into the basem so if you have this and are having the problems listed in the reviews and like a smaller compact teapot this one works great once you remove that spring. Or it pops out whichever comes first.
4,Good!! But Mindset was Effected due to WWII,"A good book, considering it is one of Heinlein's first books. I find the Idea of Nazi's on the moon a bit Resentful seing as how 47 or so Nazi's die. I like the book but believe the ending coild be a bit more like an ending."
4,Heinlein can't write a bad book!,"Although this book is not my favorite Heinlein novel, it still charaterizes what I liked most about Heinlein's work. Touring the lives of intelligent young men who use their brains instead of their brawn to take them to extraordinary places. A good read with a surprise ending!"
2,Ridiculous ending,"The book had a powerful vision, but the ending was so weak. The beggining was technical and pretty good, but when they landed on the moon it just got lame. Definately not worth a read. Check out his other books."
2,not up to the standard of his later juveniles,"In this early book, Heinlein hasn't yet found his voice. The whole thing is pretty cheesy, and very much a product of its time."
3,Doesn't stand the test of time.,"The true measure of greatness for books written for children or teens is whether they are worthy of being read by adults as well. This book fails the test. I enjoyed it immensely as a young teen, and when I ran across a copy 20 years later I was eager to read it again. The story just didn't work any more, for reasons that others have pointed out below -- so I won't repeat them."
5,A Science Fiction Milestone,"Heinlein's first ""juvenile"" novel was written skillfully and is highly entertaining. The tale of a scientist enlisting the aid of 3 boys of a rocket club to build a nuclear powered moon-rocket was scientifically accurate for the time, and inspired future NASA engineers, though the first moon-flight turned out differently. However, Heinlein's realistic characters are easy to identify with, making the story believable even to a modern-day reader."
1,Disappearing Copper Trick,"I have had these pots for about 4 years. I bought the whole set at Macy's. The copper on the bottom of mine was so thin, that about 1 year ago it started wearing through and disappearing around the edges. The stainless steel, however, is very good quality - I think they sell a straight stainless set. Paying extra for the copper bottom is probably not worth it when it is so thin that it won't be providing you any extra conductivity."
2,returned them a week later,"i've been very disappointed with this set of pots and pans. they're extremely high maintenance, as the copper-bottoms quickly and constantly become spotty. the copper quickly discolors, with some bottoms turning a darker orange and others becoming almost a light yellow. also, i felt that the advantage of having a slightly faster-heating metal on the bottoms was negated by the requirement to use these pots only at medium heat on our electric stove, since this took longer overall (although it may have helped to save energy). i purchased some aluminum flat-bottomed pots and they heated MUCH faster since they have no limitations on heat settings. these limitations just make it frustrating to learn to adjust heat settings on a different scale. i'm much happier with the aluminum-bottom pots and pans, which are easier to use and maintain."
1,Beware - these pans melt if overheated,"My mother in law bought some tool of the trade pans - I'm not sure just which ones. She left one on the stove too long and when she took it off the burner the bottom of the pan had melted. It burnt holes into the kitchen floor and luckily didn't burn her.The insurance company in our town said that another case in our area occurred when a lady was cooking in the kitchen with her toddler. Luckily it was only her cabinets that got splattered with the melting pot and burnt, not her child.These need to be taken off the market and recalled before someone gets hurt badly.If you like seared skin buy these pans."
2,You can see right through them.,"I bought these pajamas because it was a hassel to deal with a nursing bra and top at night in bed. However, if you are going to wear these pajamas in front of anyone, you will still need to wear a bra because you can see right through it."
2,Do not like the fabric,"I decided to order this set as the majority of the reviews were positive. When I received it and tried it on, I did not like the fabric at all. It is not soft as you would expect for this price. The set looks and feelsmuch cheaper than what it sells for."
2,Poor quality fabric,"I have purchased Japanese Weekend in the past - both loungewear and clothing, and had an excellent experience. The fabric was fabulous. For one specific PJ nursing/maternity set the fabric was so buttery soft that I bought another color as well, and for both I got a baby blanket each equally soft and buttery. I purchased this one in Eggplant thinking JW would not fail me. I was am very disappointed. The fabric feels very cheap, like rough cotton, and is not soft at all. The cotton is actually rough, which I don't expect for something that costs $60+. However, I will still keep it because its so hard to find nursing tops where you can feed two at the same time - I am expecting twins - this one allows me to pull down enough to be able to feed two. It does show cleavage though. I am still feeling very disappointed with JW and the fabric - I cannot believe the reviews here are so positive."
4,Pretty fun show.,"After highs chool, we just couldn't get enough of Zack, Slater & Screech so they all went to college together. Even Kelly shows up by the second epsiode. The pilot is pretty good as we even see Zack and Slater in nothing but their boxers! Of course Jesse could not join them at Cal U. She was too busy in Vegas stripping at the Cheetah before landing a spot in the Stardust hotel's Goddess show. At least she did make it to Zack & Kelly's wedding and I think I even saw Cristal Connors hitting on Mr. Belding...or was it Leslie and Alex???"
5,Amazing!,"I adored the show when I watched it in Italian (I was like 10 years at that time).Now that I'm 25 and I had the chance of watching it in the original version, I can't help loving it even more: amazing cast, funny stories, catchy songs...what more can you ask to a tv show?Thank you, Amazon, for giving me the opportunity of affording to buy the whole collection! <3"
4,"Good, cheesy fun","I bought this product because I remember watching the series when it was on and thinking that it was good, clean, cheesy fun with some of my favorite TV characters of all time."
3,PRICE!!!,Don't get me wrong...I love Saved by the Bell. I have all of the seasons minus the College Years and that's because I can't find it for a good price. Why would anyone want to buy one season for over $40 or $50? Amazon has this season on instant video for a normal price. I'm just buying that. Ridiculous!
3,Completed my collection,"We bought the college season (used from a third party amazon seller) to add to our Saved by the Bell dvd collection. The college years are okay, but just not as good as I remember. But if you are like me,vans want the entire SBTB collection, then buy it. It's definitely worth watching for memories."
5,awesome show,i have always enjoyed this show and i think it is something that all kids should watch because they do not make shows lke this anymor
5,wow has it really been that long?,"I can't believe I was in the 6th grade this lone season aired, but getting off of me. I am glad they released this on DVD, and I watch at least an episode or two of Saved by the Bell before I go to bed. I think there should have been extra features on this, such as 'Where Are They Now?'. We all know what Mario, Tiffani, Screech, and Mark-Paul are doing now but what about the drama chick, Leslie and Rogers? I'm sure there are websites about them somewhere but I think since this was aired in primetime NBC should have put some TV promotions or at least something to spice this up. Otherwise you'll enjoy the incomplete college story of the former Bayside guys and Kelly."
4,Where is Miss Bliss???????!!!!!!!,Why can't they release the Miss Bliss episodes? Who wants to see the New Class? That was the stupidest idea. We want Miss Bliss and Zack's original dad and the original Slater what was that curly-haired guys name? Tifani amber thieson ruined this show that names sounds more like a porn star name.
2,College,"I used to watch this show, yeah for like two episodes!I remember seeing the first episode and thinking, man this show kind of sucks. They should have Tiffini Amber-Thiesan's character Kelly on it, and what do you know, halfway through that first episode: she appeared.This show had Zack, Slater, Kelly, and that annoying Screech, other than that - all new people. Well hey, it was a new TV show. A spin-off.Wasn't the R.A. on the show a former football player or something? I don't recall. Oh well.I remember the final episode of this show, probably not on this set, was a lead-up to a TV movie where Zack and Kelly got married.Anyways, enjoy this DVD, if you enjoyed the show"
5,Saved by the Bell: The College Years (Complete Series),This is a fun show to watch on MTV2 and I'll be very glad when I get this show on DVD to watch anytime.
3,the audio sucks,"the audio sucks, the transitions have the music cut out, and oh yeah, the audio is terrible - its like listening to someone from 10 feet away"
1,Worthless,"Afer 12 hours and about 35 crashes, I have a cartoon-like ""landscape"" that only vaguely resembles my property and isn't even useful for proportions. I was hard pressed to find a single feature that behaved as advertized.THis software was worse than useless because it took the whole day to figure out how badly I was cheated."
1,Don't waste your money,"This Software has a real nice package with lots of great examples on it. How they made them, I have no idea! Maybe I'm to spoiled with my AutoCad LT program. I bought this program because I'm redoing my backyard. Thinking it would be nice to have a finished view of my ideas before I started (like the ones on the box), I dove right in. That was over a month ago, and I still can't get my ideas down. I'm so damn frustrated with this program, and its poor instructions, that it drove me to write this review, which I have never done before. The review from the person giving it 5 stars has to be working for the company. If I could have givin it 0 stars, I would have."
1,Not recommended,"I bought this software for my husband a year ago because we wanted to be able to put a photo of our house into the landscape plan. We have yet to figure it out. The manual is the size of a text book. The software is not user friendly. If you have lots of free time to learn how to use it, this software might be a good tool. I am not impressed."
1,I got Punched,"I ordered this software to help me design my backyard. It was way too difficult to use. Trying to look at my project from different angles was impossible. I sent in my rebate last September and have not recieved my check. I went online to see what is going with my rebate and it claims my check has already been sent. There is no date of when the rebate was sent so I guess it is the old ""Checks in the mail"" answer. If you want to keep your sanity ""DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT"". I only gave them 1 star because it did install and this site doesn't have a 0 star selection."
2,Good graphics but...,"I bought this software for designing landscape and my deck. The landscape tools have a large library of plants, shrubs and trees all nicely depicted (and you can make them grow) but you have to drag and drop them into your design and then double click on each one to get a description. Makes it hard to find what your looking for.The deck tool is very poor. It doesn't calculate materials except for railing material! (Why bother?) Any good design program should include a library of standard materials. This one doesn't."
4,Takes time to figure out but very impressive!,"First off, I would comment that if your computer is not current you may be more frustrated than anything else. I am running an AMD Athlon 1600+, 512MB of 266DDR RAM, and just bought a new 3D video card (MSI GeForce 440MX 128MB DDR) specifically for this application. I am amazed at how fast the 3D rendering is processed and how easily I can build a basic house.The one point I am having some trouble with is in using the landscape elevation tool. (I haven't looked at the manual yet other than for the initial installation.) I have tried other 3D CAD programs on an older system with a basic video card and the experience was dreadful! I believe that with a little more practice and even looking to the manual I will be able to do most anything within the products limits..."
1,What a misleading package,"I just wanted it to plan some landscaping. I am an experienced software user, and have been active in the software development industry for 15 years. Just want you to know that so you can understand that I am not a novice user.However, this is the 1st product that has me completely stumped. I doubt that I'll be able to get my money back but I will try. This has been a complete waste of time. The pictures on the package are the most misleading I have seen on a software box."
1,Don't waste your money,"I spent way too much time trying to get this program to do what I wanted it to. The 3D walkaround isn't nearly as good as Sierra's LandDesigner. Every time you put the CD in it launches the installer which can get annoying. In the course of using the product I found several bugs, one of which I couldn't find a workaround (unexpectedly resizing the right side of the lot which would then foul up every object on that side). All in all I feel like it was a waste of money."
1,Over Priced Software,"Master Landscape is not easy by any means to master. This product is very hard to use, it takes weeks to learn. My recommendations would be don't waste your money and buy something else. This product is really a 5.95 value."
1,Not for the average designer,"Plant data base is not accessable by choosing the name of an item - you choose from pictures which are dragged on to your plan and only then can you find out it's name. Also not enough choice in materials i.e. gravel, rocks, paving, outdoor garden features like pergolas, sunhouses etc. The house design is not easy to use for amateurs - not easy to construct - I am still trying to find out how to apply a flat roof to part of a house design and to build walls which actually go to the apex of the roof. I have used better and easier to use programmes 10 years ago when the technology is not what it should be today. Not recommended at all - a complete waste of money."
1,Illogical!!,A particularly illogical piece of CAD software! In my opinion a fundamentally flawed program which will do nothing other than waste your time!
1,No Sale,"After reading the reviews of this product (and they were overwhelmingly bad), I would not buy it."
2,Remedial design program,"This program looks like it does alot but once you start drawing with it you quickly see limitations. I am a Photoshop, powerpoint, excel user and am comfortable with toolbars and functions. This program will not group and move an object. Each line drawn must be adjusted individually. I gave up after 2 hours of trying to draw an odd shaped house angled on an odd shaped lot. For straight lots it will probably work fine. Also, the arial views were extremely difficult to control. I was flying all over the place but couldn't get around the corner of the house."
2,Not recommended to gardeners...,I do not recommend this program for garden design. It has a vast number of plants to choose from and although they are broken down into catagories you will not be able to search for a specific plant and the pictures are small and hard to recognize. I spent 3 hours looking through the perenials hoping to find that I wanted for my bed only to have the program lock-up on me. Oh well...I do like the home design and floorplan trace.
1,Terrible Landscape Software,"Please do not believe the hired reviewers of this software that gave it any praise. I am a landscaper and this software is useless for the do-it-your-self or for any serious designer. The plant selection is extremely limited despite the claim of the large number of plants. The plants symbols are so far off in appearance, size and color that it is laughable. I tried entering at least 50 popular landscape plants and found 2 or 3 in the database. I am only hoping that I can return this junk after I have opened it."
2,Disappointing,"The other reviewers were dead on...I bought this product from an office store, before I read these reviews. I wanted to start with the basics, and recreate a survey I had done of my property. Even using the landscaping tool for this simple task was difficult. When you drag the line beyond the window, it does not automatically scroll down, so you have to page down, and extend the line. Also, once a property line is drawn, the dimensions are too small to read. This program tries to do alot, and feels like they just bundled a bunch a inferior prodcuts together. Don't waste your time or money."
2,a bit disappointed,"i bought this coffee maker for my mom. it makes great coffee, but she likes make coffee and drink it throughout the day. there was no way of disengaging the auto shut-off. we are taking it back today. we are also disappointed that you have to reset it every time you use it."
3,Filter is terrible,"We just purchased the (almost) same model, ours had the stainless Thermal Carafe. The coffee has a distinct aluminum or stainless scent and smell..We are sending it back."
3,No More Replacement Carafes,"I love the Mill and Brew but Melitta has discontinued supplying replacement carafes (we're on ""permanent backorder"" through the company). Mellitta is not willing to help us in any way. It's a shame, really. Still looking for a company to replace it. If you buy it, don't let the pot break (ours self destructed while brewing)."
2,A Compromise,"I've had this coffee maker for a year now and the verdict is mixed. It's convenient not to have to grind the beans before putting it in the coffee maker. On the other hand, I find that the coffee that comes out is not hot enough, and therefore the coffee aromas and tastes are not released properly. The coffee tastes old even when it's freshly made. My old Krups coffee maker made a better cup of hot and tasty coffee. This Melitta's design allows too much coffee sediment to go into the pot. My wife bought this maker and I'm hoping she'll ditch it and go back to the old fashioned drip maker."
3,Mill and Brew Headache,"I bought a mill and brew about a year ago. It does make good coffee but cleaning the mesh filter got really old. You have to use high water pressure to get all of the old grids out to make a fresh pot. Also, the latch recently broke. It is poorly made and not durable. I have gone back to a separate girder and standard coffee maker."
1,5stars at first site then 1star after 3months,I bought this product because I love freshly ground coffee. It was a great coffee maker for the 1st 3months then the plastic latch that closes the grinder fell off and you could not operate unless the top was closed completely. You are unable to purchase the grinder so I'm left using a grinder and using another coffee maker. Don't waste your money.
5,Longevity Report,"I have owned this pot for 3 years now and it still works great. It's easy to clean, and saves me a fortune by brewing Starbucks coffee at home instead of buying one in the store on a daily basis.My only complaint is that mine is white, and I keep hoping it will break so I can get a black one that will match my kitchen better. I have a feeling I will be waiting awhile...I recommend this pot without hesitation to anyone I know who is in the market for a grind & brew style coffee pot."
2,Not happy with this one,"I purchased this after weighing the pros and cons from other reviews and have used it for 4 months. It is easy to clean and set up. That's where the pros end for me.-Coffee is barely hot enough unless you are making a full pot.-Since the grind takes place in the brew basket, you can only use the metal mesh filter that it comes with, this leaves muddy coffee that a paper filter won't (my preferred filter).-The flavor of the coffee is weak unless you use a lot of beans- I think this is because the brew temp is not hot enough. A free Gevalia coffee maker I have made by melita makes much stronger, fuller flavored, rich coffee!- If you like milder coffee and make full pots, this one is great for the price, quality built, otherwise avoid it."
2,Bad Build Quality,"Worked fine for a few months, then filter started falling apart allowing a lot of grinds into the coffee. Then it started leaking if the pot was pulled out before all the coffee had drained. (Have to shake the pot to make sure.) Customer Service was no help & rude."
4,A Great Machine That Won't Last Long!,"I love ourMelitta MEMB1B Mill & Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker, Blackso much that I buy one for myself and one for family members every year as Christmas presents. That's the problem, though, they only last a year!!! About a year later, the grinder gets dull (as does those little coffee grinders that you buy for $19.95.) and you have to use something to hold the lid shut (like the pill bottle shown in the picture) or it won't work. Is that why I can't buy any this Christmas?"
2,I was disappointed,"I was so excited to purchase this product, as I love fresh ground coffee and usually brew it at the same time each morning. The problem? The lowest setting for the grinder time still grinds the coffee for 15 seconds. This makes the coffee grounds way too fine and creates a distinctly bitter flavor. I only want to grind for about 8 seconds. Also some of the fine grinds pass through the gold filter and leave residue in your cup. I will be returning this product. Sorry!"
5,Love this coffee maker!!,This is the second Mill & Brew we've owned and we really love it. It's so nice to wake up to fresh ground and brewed coffee!!
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,"I purchased this coffee maker 5 years ago when they offered a thermal carafe. I absolutely love it! Makes excellent coffee, no grinding mess. But buyer beware after 18 months of daily usage the mesh filter basket becomes torn and allows coffee grounds through. You would think you could just order a replacement filter....WRONG. No replacement filters available. You have to buy a whole new coffee maker. Soooo if you don't mind spending $99 to replace your coffee maker ever 18 months this is the coffee maker for you."
2,Lacking in durability,"A good design that is let down by poor materials and workmanship.After about 13 month's of use, the latch that secures the lid on the brewing basket broke. The paint on the heating element was also beginning to fail."
3,Good Machine-Bad machine,"Makes great coffee, cleanup is easy, but poorly made so you have to treat it GENTLY - the tab on the cover that allows the machine to operate breaks off easily, and try dealing with Melitta to get a replacement cover--just plain bad (and even rude) customer service. But still I love it! Buying my third one today!"
2,Weak coffee/weak product,"I was excited when I found this product at the store. Unfortunately, I wound up disappointed. This coffee maker made bad coffee. It was weak even when I increased the amount of coffee. The grinder was not consistent even when kept on the same setting. The coffee was not very warm and the automatic shut-off activates after an hour which is too short. The few times it did brew a good cup I could not replicate even with the same beans and ratio.After about 3 months, I gave up and bought a cuisinart coffee maker. So far it has performed terrific."
2,Think twice,After some research I purchased this model several months ago. Though quite content with it initially it ultimately disappointed me. The heating element/hot plate became horribly corroded. And the small black tab that secured the top on the grinder receptacle snapped off. It's not a bad price... but I'd suggest you keep your receipt!
2,Mesh filter makes a weak cup of coffee,I bought one of these because I thought it would make it easier to brew fresh ground coffee. The beans are ground in a chamber with screen walls and then the coffee is brewed by dripping water right through the grinding chamber. This works surprisingly well and is easy to clean since you can remove the grinding chamber and rinse it out in the sink.The problem I had is that the the bottom and sides of the brewing chamber are all mesh so water ran through the beans to quickly making a weak cup of coffee. Adding more coffee produced stronger coffee but it wasn't as full-flavored as a cup brewed through a paper filter in a standard coffee maker.I ended ditching this product and going back to a standard coffee maker and a stand alone grinder. If you like the complex flavors of a strong cup of coffee you'll probably end up doing the same.
4,What a great coffee maker,I read many reviews before buying this machine and almost bought a cousinart mill and brew machine. I am so glad I did not. This machine makes great coffee. It is very simple to clean and when you grind beans the beans do not go all over it stays with in the chamber.I couldn't figure out the program for later option after I got it to work once and then for some reason couldn't figure it out again (turned out to be a dumb operator error) but I called customer support and they were very helpful and if the problem did continue they would take the unit back and get another right out to me. I figure out what I was doing wrong in the end.GET THIS MACHINE! for the money I don't think you could do any better than this.
5,Great Coffee At An Affordable Price,"This baby is GREAT. After two frustrating years with my Krups Coffee Maker and its high price, this one is a big surprise. It brews good tasting coffee, is easy to use, grinds the beans quietly and quickly and produces a cup of coffee in just a few minutes. My only complaint is that cleaning the grinds is a bit messy, but I can live with the mess because the coffee is great and the price is right.Thus far, knock on wood, I have not encountered the problems of other reviewers and have owned the coffee maker for about six months. I would recommend the Melitta if you are looking for an affordable coffee maker that brews a nice cup of coffee."
4,"Good, strong coffee!","I tried the Cuisinart, and though it cleaned fairly easily (in dishwasher), and finally got rid of my coffee grounds mess, it was loud, and made TERRIBLE coffee. It was much too weak for my taste, even with the maximum amount of beans, and less water than a full pot. I even tried paper filters instead of the gold one. I then bought the Melitta and am extremeley happy with the coffee - it is nice and strong. I use more coffee than the 1 scoop/2 cups, and grind fairly fine - but my coffee tastes great.I give it only 4 stars because I'm worried about the durability of the grinder/filter combo. I like disposable filters, but oh well. If the coffee is good, I can adapt."
3,PARTS!,"I bought this coffee maker about a year ago (and spent almost twice as much as it costs here!). It makes great, fresh coffee. However, parts break easily. When I called Melitta to purchase replacement parts, they refused to sell them to me because the cover needed to be removed. They wanted me to send it to them, with $40.oo so they could repair it! I decided just to purchase a new one and keep the old one for spares.Good coffee, poor service."
3,Good Coffee...until the filter breaks.,"I have looked at the other reviews for this product and fear the worse for my Militta. I have had mine for about 1.5 years and am pretty happy with it. I have seen the coffee come out as light brown water but only when my boyfriend attempted to use the machine in the begining. I just assumed that he was doing something wrong since it had never happened to me. However, the filter really needs to be replaced and I cannot find one. Is this supposed to be a disposable machine? I still really like my Militta... I just wish they would make replacement parts."
4,2 Years and still going strong...,Had the Cuisinart Grind'n'Brew before. What a total pain it was to clean. Bought the Melitta based upon Amazon reviews as I really wanted something easier to clean. Haven't been disappointed. Various plastic bits broke during the first year and I got 2-3 replacement parts under warranty. Post warranty everything has held up fine so far. I would buy another as I've been very happy with the coffee from the Melitta. Agree that the coffee isn't quite hot enough when first brewed but a few minutes on the hot plate or 30 seconds in the microwave take care of that. Overall highly recommended.
4,grinder basket blowout,"We have had our mill and brew pot for 2 years. We have had latch issues that have not disabled the pot. Recently, the basket developed a leak causing ground to escape into the pot. I spent several hours snooping the net for a replacement with no luck. Actually came to Amazon to buy a new pot and read about the great Melitta customer service. I called the 800-947-3745 number and now have a new brew basket on the way for $7.59 and no shipping.We love our mill and brew. We previously had two Cuisinart grind and brews that we used alternately while the other went back and forth to the factory for 6 months at a crack."
2,Terrible Customer Service,"After three tries at trying to get information on how to get a replacement for the coffee basket, I have given up. If you can't get replacement parts, just how worthwhile is a product to a consumer. I'll find a new pot from a manufacturer that is more customer friendly."
2,I've had better...,"The biggest problem with this coffee maker is that it shuts off in an hour- too short for relaxing on a Sunday morning, sipping refills.I like the Cuisinart better, but like others have said, it is VERY messy, with FIVE parts to clean each time vs. 2 for the Melitta."
3,Love the coffeemaker but it doesn't last long,"This is a wonderful coffeemaker but very frustrating. I am on my second one and have had it just over a year when the fastner on the cover for the coffee broke. This is exactly what happened to the original one. There isn't anything out there that compares. However, I wish they would make the Melitta last longer than a year!!"
1,Makes the worst coffee I've ever had,"I cannot imagine why so many people like this coffeemaker. I have made 12 mugs of coffee with it over the past 4 days, and even though I used DOUBLE the amount of beans I normally use, the coffee comes out very weak every time. I tried various grind settings, but they made no difference.Other things I hate about this unit:- You have to clean it after EVERY pot of coffee because it has a permanent filter (thus you can't just pull the filter/grounds out). I make 1 mug of coffee 3 times a day, so I have to clean it 3 times a day!- The permanent filter allows some of the grinds to end up in your coffee, which is unpleasant."
1,terrible - requires A LOT of beans to make decent coffee,"I purchased this coffemaker based on the reviews. Used it once, following the recommended amount of 1 scoop of beans for 2 cups of coffee and it came out as tea. Threw it out. Set it to the finer setting. Tried again, this time 2 scoop of beans. Again, horrible watery coffee. Third time used 2 scoops for 1 cup of coffee. Again weak watery coffee. Just out of curiosiosity at this point, I used 4 scoops of beans for 1 cup. This time finally it started to look like coffee although it was still on the weak side. And if you are thinking this reviewer must prefer espresso, NOT really. This coffeemaker is ridiculous. What one is saving on the price of the machine, one would spend very easily on coffee beans. I think the problem is that the blades throw the ground coffee to the sides instead of the bottom of the cone, therefore when the water drips down there is not much coffee there. I returned it the next day."
1,I Hate It.,1. It does not make enough coffee - 50 oz2. It shuts off automatically after 1 hour.3. The basket is hard to load.4. It Makes a big mess.5. The stupid grinder comes on when you reset the on/off to keep it from cutting off after one hour. You have to shut the grinder off first.Find another coffee maker.
3,Am I being too harsh?,"Do I expect too much from my $70 coffee maker? After nearly 3 years of daily grinding and brewing the latch lid broke and my lovely Melitta will brew no more. I was lulled by the timer, the freshly ground beans, the wafting odor of coffee diffusing through my morning haze --It was love. But then I was let down just when my devotion/addiction was at its peak. Is it telling that I gave my coffee maker a man's name? Should one expect more than 3-years from a home appliance? Well, I do. I committed to this machine and now I feel bereft. My next coffee maker will probably not grind the beans at the optimal time -at the pre-risen dawn -and it will probably not have that German shrill scream, but it will love me as long as I need it to."
1,What a mess!,"OK, so I don't drink coffee, but my husband does so I thought I'd buy him this really cool pot that grinds and brews! After using it for a year, it's going to be replaced. I can't stand the mess it makes. After grinding the coffee, my husband rinses the basket in the sink. Not only does it send grinds all over the sink, it also leaves an oily mess. For Christmas he's getting a new grinder and coffee pot that JUST BREWS!"
4,Our Second Mill and Brew,"We have recently purchased our second Melitta Mill and Brew. As we did before purchasing our first one we looked carefully again at the competing brands that were closest in price, all of which however cost more, the highest being $100. more. These all had many small pieces and moving parts and were difficult to clean -- Not so the Melitta. Both the ease of use and the ease of cleaning are outstanding and the coffee that is brewed, either from ground or from beans, is uniformly excellent. This would easily rate 5 stars but there is one minor ""flaw"" that might be important to some users. Immediately upon completion of brewing with the carafe filled with fresh coffee, the brew is not piping hot. It should stand in the carafe for about five minutes and, after that short wait, be removed for an outstanding drink - whether one cup or filled to the max."
4,Melitta Mill & Brew easier to use than Cuisinart Grind & Brew,"The Melitta product produces a tasty cup of coffee. The positives are that the cleanup takes a very few minutes, and all the parts that get grungy with coffee bits are easy to remove and swish clean under the faucet. My Cuisinart is considerably harder to clean, and it now lives in the basement along with other ""spare appliances."" I like the ability to lengthen/shorten the grind time, a feature not found on the Cuisinart.I wish that the screen on the permanent filter basket were a bit finer. The bottom of the pot seems to collect ""fines"" that a paper filter would never pass, and a paper filter cannot be used with this coffeemaker. I also wish that the grinder would accommodate more beans, as I prefer a stronger brew. The temperature of the brewed coffee is just right for me, as is the taste.A thermal carafe would have been a nice touch. But I have put a thermal carafe right next to the coffee maker, overcoming that shortfall."
4,Melitta Mill & Brew,"Makes excellent coffee. Easier to clean than my previous Cuisinart and doesn't ""clog"" as it did. Filter basket filter a bit flimsy."
1,don't buy...real problems,"I bought this coffee maker a year ago, and I'm getting replacing it today. I was disappointed from the beginning because the coffee it makes is NOT HOT ENOUGH. The top to the basket broke within a few months, and we have had to wedge it closed ever since to make it run. It's unattractive on the counter--lots of shiny plastic, and a shape that's the opposite of streamlined. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MACHINE AT ALL."
2,Does not produce quality coffee,"The idea of this machine is great, but unfortunately the results are less than spectacular. On the highest grind setting, it produces a watery, muddy cup of coffee, not at all what you would expect. The heating element burns the coffee easily if you leave it on for more than a couple of minutes after you brew.I have experimented and experimented with this machine and can not get a good cup of coffee out of it. My $9.99 machine from Target produced a better quality coffee."
2,Pieces wear out,"I received this coffee maker as a gift 2 years ago. After a year and a couple of months' daily use, the gear at the bottom of the grinding basket wore out and we could no longer use the ""grind"" feature of the grind-and-brew, which was the main reason we wanted it to begin with... Soon after, the latch which holds the ginder lid in place broke off, and unfortunately, the coffee maker won't work unless it senses that this lid is closed. So we had to resort to weighing the lid down with various objects... and finally we gave up all together. I loved the convenience and ease of grind-and-brew while it lasted, but it didn't last long enough for the price."
2,Disappointed,"This is a handsome machine, with some excellant features. It also appears to be be well-made. Unfortunately, I'm not happy with the coffee it brews. Manufacturer recommends 1 scoop of beans for one cup. I'm up to 3 scoops per mug, and I'm still not happy with the flavor. If you're a real coffee-lover, you're not going to be happy with this purchase. My old $20. drip machine makes better coffee."
5,Love this coffee maker!,"I have only owned it a couple of weeks, but it makes wonderful coffee and I love to program it so I wake up to the sound of coffee beans grinding in the morning. I like the fact that it is easy to use and easy to clean. Hopefully, it will last for a long, LONG time.p.s. It is now May 15, 2002 and my Melitta is still working great!"
2,Great coffee but too easy to break,"I was given this coffee maker for a birthday gift a couple of years ago and after I figured out how to make it work, loved it. After a while the latch on the top broke off and I had to hold the top down while it was grinding the coffee. That made the timer on it useless unless you propped something against it to hold the top down. It was a little inconvenient but I got use to it. Then the metal filter broke and I decided to get a new one. Luckily I put the old one in the garage for ""spare parts"" because not long after I started using the new one the side tab broke off and I had to grab a replacement off the old one. I will probably not purchase this brand again."
3,Fine Coffee Cleanup a bit of a pain,Bought the coffee maker a couple of months back. Good coffee though would prefer a finer filter. cleanup is a bit messy and a PITA at times not sure that it saves much time or effort versus grinding the beans in a grinder. Cleanup was much better with disposable filters. Another peeve is no feature for keeping the plate warm for more than an hour (I know thats heresy to the true aficionado) Thinking about a keurig for christmas.
3,Average Quality,"Previously had a Capresso grind and brew machine which could make a full pot of strong coffee. Due to the limited amount of beans that can be accommodated in the Melitta machine, only 6-7 cups of strong coffee can be brewed. Again, compared to the cone-filter Capresso, I don't much care for cleaning this grinder basket/filter. I do like that the water reservoir can be seen on the outside and I like the carafe better."
3,Stainless Steel Basket,The stainless steel basket becomes brittle and falls apart after 1 year. I am still searching for a place that sells a replacement basket. It is not worth buying if it is that difficult to replace the basket.
5,"At last, a convenient grind and brew","We just replaced our Cuisinart grind/brew with this machine. What a difference! This model is well thought out, easy to clean and makes decent coffee.Programming is simple and intuitive (unlike the Cuisinart). Every part of the water tank is reachable for cleaning. The best part is the grinder - quiet and easy to clean.This unit grinds and brews in the same chamber - eliminating the annoyance of have having to wash and thoroughly dry every single piece before making a second pot of coffee. Since everything happens in the same chamber, there is no need for the coffee to be suctioned from one chamber to another. This cuts way down on noise, and coffee isn't left behind in the grinder. Our Cuisinart consistently left coffee in the grinder or along pathway to the brew chamber.The unit is sized to fit well in standard kitchens. It doesn't hog counterspace.All in all, the best on the market - and at half the cost of the Cuisinart."
2,Turns off after 1 hour!,"This is a good little machine if you like your coffee beans ground at the instant the coffee is brewed. I've had it almost a year without any trouble. HOWEVER, the reason I'm only rating it a 2 is because it fails at the most basic level by not keeping the coffee hot after 1 hour (the hot plate turns off), and there is no way to override it. So when I brew coffee in the morning and start work, by the time I am ready for my second cup (after being on the phone, checking emails, etc) the coffee is cold and I have to microwave it. Just keep that in mind. Otherwise, it's fine, but I am surprised the designers think 1 hour of hot coffee is acceptable."
1,Disappointed,Ordered twice; first coffee maker arrived broken - the second coffee maker did not make coffee hot enough then the grinder quit working. I was surprized in that I've always thought of melita as having a quality product. I liked the grind and brew cocept and would like to have received a coffee maker which worked well. I have returned both.
4,Good model but doesn't last !,I have purchased two Melitta Grind & Brew coffeemakers. I like the ease of cleaning( way better than other brands) and the coffee tastes great and the price is reasonable. But the plastic parts do break within a year. I'll probably need to replace my current coffeemaker within a few months. I've got a couple of cracks in the plastic. But I will buy another Melitta Grind and Brew.
3,Nothing against the build quality but the coffee tastes bad!,"I usually never write reviews unless I really really like the item or am really disappointed. In this case it's the latter. I bought a white one at a garage sale and have been using it with pre-ground coffee. I've been using this machine for a few months now and I just cannot get the coffee taste I desire. To compare, I have a cheap $10 CoffeeMate maker at work, which makes excellent coffee - and all we have at work is Folgers, the cheapest you can find. The more coffee you put in Melitta, the more sour the taste is but there is no ""boldness"" in taste. I, now, wait till I get to work to get my morning coffee! I think the problem is that maybe the water isn't hot enough or it runs through too quickly. But, I'm probably now going to get the same coffee maker as I have at work and stop with this madness. I imagine I'd be upset if I had spent more than the $5 it cost me at the garage sale."
1,Poor Quality,This coffee maker broke and is NOT easy to use. I DO NOT recommend it. We've had it a year and will be tossing it in the trash as soon as we get another.
5,Long lasting,"I bought this machine in 2001. It has lasted 6 years. I've not had to replace any parts. A couple of days ago the latch on the grinder lid broke off but it still works if I hold it down. Easy to use. Sometimes when pouring, coffee spills down the side of the carafe and makes a mess."
4,A nice change,Enjoy the flavor of ground beans. Wish the warmer time could be adjusted. Two hours would be better than one on weekend mornings. A separate grinder with dry grounds easier to clean than the wet grounds in the mesh cup of the unit.
2,Great coffee maker but breaks easily,"We've had great coffee from this coffee maker. Its probably the best we've ever bought, but it has shortcomings! The grinder latch broke after a few months and you can't get replacement parts so you can forget about having fresh coffee ready when you wake up! It will still work, but you physically have to hold down the griner top until it starts to brew!"
4,"great coffee,quality problem","I originally thought that this was the greatest coffee maker inthe world, but I have had quality issues with the product. The mill/brew assembly broke off twice for me as it did for the other reviewer. First, I sent the entire machine back and had it replaced, which is a result of great customer service, however I didn't have a coffee maker for three weeks..and now I am actually on this website to try and buy a new one instead of waiting for the replacement. Obviously the coffee maker does an excellent job. The other mill and brew mchine I had made a mess of the grounds and was terrible. This is definetly the best machine I have ever had, but I just wish the quality was better..."
5,A must buy for the coffee lover !,This coffee maker actually has me making great coffee. It is easy to use and always taste perfect.
4,Melitta Coffeemaker MEMB1B,"This coffeemaker beats cuisanart coffeemaker hands down. Very few parts to clean and quick to make coffee. One problem I don'tunderstand is why the manufacturer doesn't fix the top that closes the grinder. I've seen so many reviews about this problem,otherwise it's a great coffeemaker. I'd still buy it again because of the ease of use."
2,Leaky Carafe - Poor Customer Service,"This is my third grinding coffee maker and the basic machine is very good and importantly cleans easily, howere it ends heer teh stainles steel carafe leakes coffee since day one, its been 8 month since receiving the maker and first complaining we get the run around and little postcards telling mehow sorry they are but our replacement carafe has been moved out another 90 days! This may not see like much but there is nothing like pouring a cup of hot coffee and getting a half of cup all over the counter or floor!I woudl not buy again based on thsi single fact!"
4,No muss - no fuss,"Finally, I can enjoy a great cup of coffee without spilling grounds on the counter. I have been using this product for about 10 months now and am very pleased. It is easy to clean and easy to use and makes a good cup of coffee. What more do you need? They almost got it perfect but here are two things that need more work. 1. The lid to the coffee basket is sometimes difficult to close. You have to be careful here otherwise something might break on the latch. 2.The base of the basket looks slightly flimsy and I am a little concerned about the longevity of the part.I can certainly recommend this product. I am very pleased with it."
4,Great Coffee,The Melitta Mill and brew does a great job of removing the clutter from the counter. It is easy to program and simple to use. Cleanup is quick and the parts reassmble easily. The finished product is a GREAT cup of coffee. Two negative features. 1. The automatic mill time cannot be reduced beyond 15 seconds. 2. The warming unit automatically shuts off after 1 hour Other than that I highly recommend this coffeemaker.
2,melita coffe maker,The mellita coffeemakler is ok but it does not heat the coffee enough. The temperature of freshly brewed cup is only tepid and it goes down hill from there. The coffee taste good enough but I don't like it that tepid.Clean up is easy.
4,Nice replacement pot,Like the new coffee machine. Only a couple things we would change. Coffee could be hotter and the filter easier to clean. Otherwise its a great replacement to our Cuisinart.
3,"Replacement for the ""Permanant Basket""","after 6 months of use, we are in need of having to change the stainless basket inside. For heavens sake, I can't find them anywhere. Buyers beware; after so many scrubs, the basket starts to fray apart. And even with the smallest fray, you get terrible muddy coffee. blah! If anyone knows where I can get a stainless basket let me know please!Alan"
2,Broken Top & Cold Coffee Make for Lukewarm Review,"This could be a nice pot if: 1) They would fix the breaking lid problem, and 2) If they changed the pot so the coffee would get and stay hot. Same problem as everyone else has mentioned here in the reviews. What's nice about this coffee maker is the easy grind and brew. It's also quite easy to clean. Needless to say, we've just got to have hot coffee on these cold winter days in Colorado, so we're looking for a different brand."
2,Doesn't hold up over time,"LOVED this coffee pot, and the quality of the coffee it brewed, until it developed a small crack in the mesh on the filter/grinder, and no one from Melitta found it important enough to answer my inquiry about buying a new part. Then, this morning, the latch that holds the filter/grinder in place gave way and the only way for me to get my fix was to hold the top down (for safety reasons, it turns itself off if the top is open). Anyway, it didn't last me two years..."
5,Good start to the day.,This is the third coffee pot from Melitta. We have been so pleased with ours that we have given two as gifts.Each time the recipient has been very pleased with the product.Good coffee that stays hot until the pot is empty.
5,Love it!,I liked my first one so much I bought another one. It makes the best coffee because it is freshly ground....doesn't get any better than that!
2,Coffee not hot,"I've had this for a little over a year and now the lid just won't snap closed (a must in order for brew to start). Which is fine. I have been waiting for it to go kaput so I can buy a new one. This one is a gift and I would have never bought this for myself had I the choice. I didn't like it when i looked at it. It seems cheaply made of black plastic. The big gripe i have is that I am constantly reheating my coffee and prior to pouring a cup, I heat up my milk. This has been my OVER year long ritual. But not anymore...i've researched and I'm off to cuisinart.."
3,grind and brew coffee maker,"Makes good coffee but has several parts to wash and you cannot use a paper filter. The biggest complaint I have is with customer service, I dropped the removable part of the coffee maker and broke one of the locks, I e-mailed their customer service dept. and asked for instructions on how to order replacement parts, that was a month ago, I'm still waiting for a reply. My next Grind & Brew will be a cousinart, they have excellent customer service. By the way, the coffee maker still works fine with the broken lock."
4,Very good choice,"This machine is fantastic and costs less than many machines with less features. I still think that the clean-up could be easier, but overall we are very happy with it. Whoever thought that it breaks easily must be clumsy and not take care of their appliances. Additionally, if you turn the machine on and don't put the pot on the plate, don't blame the machine for getting your kitchen wet..."
5,Please come back Mill & Brew!!!,I purchased this coffeemaker several years ago from Target and I LOVE IT ... the latch did break on the lid but improvised for years by placing something on top that would hold it down. Now the carafe broke .. and I want another Militta Mill & Brew but seems it is no longer available. I am so bummed .. Militta: Please bring this wonderful coffeemaker back!!
5,MELITTA MEMB1,"I HAVE OWNED THIS COFFEEMAKER FOR CLOSE TO 4 YEARS AND LOVE IT. I HAVE REPLACED THE LID ONCE IN ALL THE YEARS OF OPERATION. I DECIDE I NEEDED TO BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR BACKUP, BUT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND ONE. SO, I CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE AT MELITTA TO SEE IF I COULD PURCHASE ONE DIRECT. I WAS TOLD THAT MEMB1 IS DISCONTINUED AND REPLACED WITH THAT NEW RADIO COFFEEMAKER. I PURCHASED THE NEW MODEL AND LOW AND BEHOLD IT WILL NOT WORK IN MY AREA, DUE TO THE MOUNTAIN RANGE. IT WILL ONLY WORK IF IT PICKS UP A RADIO SIGNAL AND THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO BYPASS THIS SYSTEM TO MAKE COFFEEMAKER WORK. NEEDLESS TO SAY I HAD TO RETURN IT TO THE ONLINE STORE. SO BE CAREFUL IF YOU CONSIDER BUYING THE NEW MODEL, BECAUSE IT WILL NOT WORK IN CERTAIN AREA'S. SO FOR ALL OF US WHO LOVE THE MEMB1, CALL MELITTA, WRITE MELITTA AND TELL THEM TO START MAKING THIS REMARKABLE COFFEEMAKER AGAIN."
1,"Great Coffee Maker, Sneaky Company","I loved this maker--simply elegant, easy to clean and reliable. Unfortunately, my filter basket screen started to separate from the plastic allowing grounds to flow into the coffee. Melitta has not only discontinued this item (model MEMB1), but it has made parts unavailable. However, I bought their new model, ME1MSB, which is similar to the old, but with more complex electronics and a weather radio. Lo and behold, the filter basket in the new model is EXACTLY THE SAME as it was in the old model! As for the new model, electronics are too complex, weather radio not only doesn't work, it connects to MSNDirect which is stopping service in 2012. As for the new model's coffee brewing design, it's still good."
4,Meliita MEMB1,"Great Coffee(!!!) from this most reasonably priced machine...however, this is my second macahine and, like the first, the latch broke forcing me to get creative with ways to hold down the cover while it grinds using the timer mode...in both cases the latch lasted about a year maybe 18 months,,,clever way to get you you to buy a new one."
3,"Great coffee maker and mill, but fatally flawed","I really do love this coffee maker. You add fresh bean and water the night before, set the programmer, and wake up in the morning to fresh brewed coffee made from freshly ground beans.So why the 3 stars? Minus one star for lack of durability. After 10 months of daily use, the little piece of brittle plastic that keeps the top of the coffeemaker securely closed broke (this piece is necessary in order for the machine to turn on). The customer service was prompt and friendly, sent us a UPS packing slip to return them the broken coffeemaker and 2 weeks later a new one arrived.So why the 3 stars? Minus one star for an insufficient warranty. Two months later, the little piece of plastic broke again and now there is no more warranty coverage offered.I love this coffeemaker, but it is not durable enough."
4,"Great idea, even better coffee, but falls short of Greatness","The mill & brew is a nice concept and much easier to clean than other brands of the same caliber. The Melitta has a decent cord length and the updated carafe makes spilling a thing of the past. The selectable grind settings are a very nice touch as is the programmable timer. Now for the gripes: 1. The whole system is made out of a brittle plastic which is very easy to break as this is my third unit. I am by no means rough on things but an accidental drop while drying WILL break parts. 2. I wish they would have made a 12 cup capacity model. 3. The mill assembly could be easier to keep clean as there are too many nooks and crannies to get into and the mill basket could be constructed a bit better. 4. The mill selector switch is not easily understood, the light on is actually turning the mill off while the light off uses the mill. The Melitta is not the best combo unit out there, but for the money, it makes one heck of a cup of coffee."
4,Best value grind and brew,I would have given this coffeemaker a 5 star rating except for the plastic taste it left in the fisrt 1/2 dozen brews.That said it is a very reliable product that I would seek out and buy again. I had this exact model under another marketers name and it was great. I mistakenly cleaned it with a harsh made for coffeemaker cleaner and destroyed it. Leaked terribly. I quickly replaced it with the same model.
5,Can the World's Best Coffee Be this Easy?,"With the Melitta Mill & Brew coffee fans can brew outstanding coffee in their own kitchens. This Melitta product is so easy to use. Just load fresh coffee beans in the basket, add water for the number of cups you're making and press the button. The Mill & Brew grinds your beans and very quickly cycles the hot water through the drip mechanism. Its that easy.One of the key features of the Mill & Brew is that it fills your kitchen with the best fresh coffee aroma. For coffee hounds, that's the aroma that gets the day off to a great start.The Mill & Brew is much less complex (fewer parts) than some of its competitors. Its a snap to clean up.Buy the Mill & Brew to open up a new world of fresh roasted, whole bean coffee. You can find many small roasters who can provide you with custom selected and prepared coffees from all over the world. ENJOY."
2,Great but Breaks,As other people have mentioned this is a great product for about 8 months to a year. Then the latch breaks. I have bought two in a row but I am going to try another manufacture. The latch is plastic and keeps the lid down during the grinding and brewing process. I figured they would have fixed this after the first but my second one just broke this week. Just wanted to let others be aware of this issue.
4,Wonderful Aromatherapy!,"My wife and I both love the sound of that coffee grinding in the morning, and the aroma is so tantalizing. We look forward to that first cup of fresh brew. This is our second purchase of a grind and brew and we are very happy with this one. A great purchase! So good, that a month later, we bought one for our daughter as a BD gift."
1,Don't waste your money,"Very disappointing. I purchased the Melitta Mill and Brew after my Cuisinart Grind and Brew wore out (five years old). A friend had recommended the Melitta and I decided to try it because the price was so reasonable.I used the coffee maker for three weeks and was never able to get a good cup of coffee. I had to add extra beans just to get it strong enough, but it was never really quite strong enough. Finally, I put the coffeee maker back in the box and went out and bought another Cuisinart."
4,Very good coffee maker,"I did a lot of research prior to this purchase. I currently work for Gevalia and my father is a big coffee drinker, so I wanted to make sure to get a grinder/brewer that he would enjoy. This unit is very sleek and professional looking. The cups we've had have been very good and the Melitta name is well respected. We've had this coffee maker for probably close to two years now and haven't had any problems.Two knocks on it that I guess I could give is that like most coffee makers, the area to pour the water is kind of in a strange location in the back and a tad hard to pour into. The other thing is, also like most coffee makers, that measuring the right amount of beans/grinds to use to make cups can remind you that you are a chemist. My dad had to make a little chart to remind him exactly how many scoops make what type cups."
3,Not hot,"Want to reiterate that the coffee maker does not keep coffee hot. I must always put in the microwave. Also, reminder that you only put enough beans in the grider for 1 carafe -- unlike others that store beans and grind what it needs."
4,"Good, but not the best......","I'm not good at lengthy reviews, so I'll keep this short. I have owned this machine for over 5 years now and have NEVER had a problem with it. I keep the mill set at a medium grind (4) and grind away. Everyone who has ever had coffee at my house loves it. Can't think of a much better recommendation than that. Two problems, one and probably the biggest, the coffee needs to be hotter. It is definitely not at the recommended internal temp between 195 and 205 degrees when brewing, and two, I wish it came with a 12 cup carafe rather than the 10 cup. I am constantly having to make more than one pot for all my coffee greedy friends...(:."
3,Warm Coffee,"I used this for 2 years and and traded it in for a Cuisinart.The Melitta worked well, except that the brewing temp. is way too low. I loved the built in grinder. I was also diasppointed with Cuisinart and after 6 months with it I am now looking for a goof french press coffee maker."
3,Broken Top,"DO NOT buy the Melita Grind & Brew !After just 10 months, the top no longer stays closed for brewing--latch is broken or something. And you can't brew with out the top all the way down--so we now have to place a weight on top of the unit each time we brew! Terrible! And no recourse."
3,Too many Cons .....,"Pros; Coffee is okay. Neat Looking, Small Footprint.Cons; Cleanup is a pain. Prep is a pain. Only 1 hour warmer. Pause to pour works %50 of the time at best. Flimsy parts that will obviously break(I'm returning mine before that starts).Priced like a high end well built coffee maker.Great for the person having one or two cups of fruit flavored coffee every now and then."
2,Mediocre,This coffee pot doesn't work as well as other brands that we have owned. Most times some of the coffee grounds end up in the pot. It automatically grinds each time you hit the start button so you can't just add more water to an existing pot and reheat (one of my favorite short cuts when my husband hasn't left enough in the morning to fill my travel mug).
1,This is a terrble coffee maker. It broke as soon as we got it.,This is the worst coffee maker ever. It broke right away. I can not get the grinding basket to work. Amazon does not want it back and the part is too expensive to buy. Amazon should take it bake and send me another one but they will not do that. So it goes in the trash in less than a year old. Thank you Amazon
2,Works great....for a while...,"I have had such a love/hate relationship with this coffeemaker. What made me get it in the first place was the ability to grind the beans right before brewing. At first, I loved coffeemaker - freshly ground beans every time, great coffee...wonderful! Then, like others, my plastic piece broke off. No problem, just taped down the lid instead. Then the timer malfunctioned a few times. Well, ok, it's a machine...it's allowed to have a glitch every so often. Then I went to pull out the carafe mid-brew, and the coffee flow stopped as usual...then continued, and wound up all over the counter! Well, it was nice while it lasted. I would not buy another Melitta, nor would I recommend it to anyone else. There were just too many ""little"" things that went wrong with it."
1,Not a Good Coffe Maker,"I purchased my coffe maker only a few months ago. At first I thought I was not emptying the carafe because the coffee was all over the counter. Today, AGAIN, the coffee was all over the counter and I found out I only had 1/2 CUP in the carafe. This is totally unacceptable! I am very disappointed in this coffee maker and will never purchase another one. I am going back to grinding my own coffee and the drip pot. Especially the pot you can see through!"
2,Had to return it,"I bought the Mill & Brew in September. I was happy with it at first, although I never got over thinking that the mill on/off light was counter-intuitive (light is on, when mill is off). However, two months after purchase it began taking longer and longer to brew. We cleaned it per the instructions, but there was no improvement. The coffee it produced was sludge-like. We came to believe that it was over-heating the water, which caused the water to evaporate. If we attempted to make 8 cups of coffee, we got about 4-5 cups of sludge and it took more than 45 minutes to brew. I returned it for a full refund this weekend."
2,"it's ok, BUT>>>","yummy coffee...but i find that you have to quickly jump in after the grinding process and ""tamp"" down the grounds before the brewing begins, or else the coffee will be a lovely tan color...kinda like a caramel...and will taste like nothing. in the grinding process, the grounds fly up the sides and if you don't knock them down, there's nothing to brew. unless you're making 10 cups ALL THE TIME, which i am not."
3,Beans won't grind....,"I loved my first Melitta Mill & Brew, which I had for a little over a year, until the latch broke on the lid and the grinder wouldn't work unless I held the lid down, so I went out and bought another one. Here it is less than a year later and the same piece has broken off of my new machine. Now it's back to not setting the timer and holding the lid down while my beans grind.The upside to this story, I called Melitta (800-947-3744) today and they are shipping me the replacement parts in order to repair it. Seems this is a common problem (I see another reviewer has posted a photo of his machine with the same defect). Too bad they charge $5.00 for the part (shipping included), but it's better than running out and buying a whole new coffeemaker. All and all, I really do like this machine, although I wish they would make a more durable latching device, possibly not one out of plastic."
4,Fresh coffee wit the least hassle,"A true coffee snob would never use a drip Coffeemaker. Although I love fresh, strong coffee( I even roast my own beans!), I'm not willing to give up the convenience of having coffee ready when I wake up. Here's what's great about this pot:Built in Grinder: Coffee is ground fresh in the morning for the best brew. Also, you don't spill grounds on the kitchen counter. Put your old grinder in the basement.Simple design: My 9 year old makes the coffee now. Easy to clean, takes up no more space on the counter. The Cuisinart looks like a plumbing nightmare compared to this.(And its HUGE.)Pours without spilling: I loved my old Mr. Coffee, but I could never get a clean pour.If you want to make better coffee than this, you need to go to a manual method, such as French Press."
4,would be 5 stars...but,"I love the Melitta mill and brew coffeemaker and would love to give it a 5 star rating but it has a major flaw-the top housing that contains the filter is made poorly. This is the second mill and brew that I've owned and the top has broken on both of them. I'm not sure how the lid broke but the last time, I found a small plastic chip when I opened the lid and it would not close securely after that. It's not that it can't be operated with a broken top, it can. I had to fashion a weight out of a bag of unpopped popcorn to hold the lid down; not exactly an attractive option but it gets the job done. The concept of this product is brilliant-set timer to automatically grind and brew a delicious cup of coffee that awaits you when you waken but I will have to think seriously about purchasing this product again unless Melitta corrects this flaw."
4,"Two units, each lasted 2 years before a broken latch","Like so many others who own this have reported, the latch holding the lid down over the coffee basket has broken on our machine. The thing is so small, the first machine we owned, I could not locate the broken piece. When the same thing happened to the second machine, I marveled at how so small a piece could render the unit unusable, and pondered for a day or two before discovering yet another use for the venerable roll of duct tape we keep around the house. Now, every few days, I re-duct tape the lid down so brewing goes on. I've read that others have called Salton for the replacement part, and I will too, maybe, eventually, but for the last 6 months, a 2 inch piece of duct tape administered every few days keeps the thing going..."
5,Anyone have one they want to sell?,"I've been using one if these (the same one) for about eight years now. I liked it so much I've given them to family members for christmas presents. Yes, the latch breaks if you look at it crosseyed, Ok, the filter screen can come loose, and the side locks on the barrel pop off. The bottom line is the thing costs less than 60 bucks yet makes a better cup of coffee than anything up to twice its price. Besides, none of the above problems keep it from working.Now these machines are no longer made, guess I'll be haunting garage sales and ebay scrounging parts to keep mine alive."
2,Leaks,"I have had this same coffee maker before and absolutely loved it. When the carafe was dropped by someone here at the office, I tried to find a replacement carafe - couldn't find one even on the Melitta site - so I bought a whole new machine. Unfortunately, this one keeps pouring coffee even though you should be able to pull the pot out while brewing. Our office goes through enough coffee to make this quite annoying. It still brews great coffee though."
1,The worst!,"Purchased the coffee maker. Coffee was not good and was not hot right after brewing. This is the worst machine I have ever used. Needless to say, I returned it."
2,Coffee not hot,The unit is designed well for a grind and brew and is easy to clean. The coffee comes out at a lukewarm 150 degrees farenheit however. I have tried prewarming the carafe with 210 degree water but it doesn't help the situation much. The box states that the unit turns off after an hour but the instructions make no mention of this feature. There is no hot plate so I don't even know what they are referring to in this regard. The system relies totally on the metal carafe to keep the coffee warm and it fails because the coffee is not warm in the first place. I cannot recommend this unit and I am looking for a new coffee maker.
3,very disappointed!,"I read the reviews on this item so I was confident in buying it. Since I have used this I am not happy with it at all. It doesn't make a very hot pot, so when I add my cream I need to microwave it to heat it up. The grinder part is an absolute pain to clean! The timer to turn burner off is set way too short and cannot be adjusted. I thought with this price I would be much happier with the overall machine, but am not."
3,Just OK...,"When my last coffee maker went ka-put, I started searching around. I decided on the Melitta most based on rec's from this site. The positive qualities of this product are (1)I like having it all in one. It makes my countertops look cleaner. And (2) the price. In other brands, for this same price, you don't get the timer or the mill & brew all in one.However, I am not all that impressed. The negetives are (1) there are too many parts to clean. The grinder, the top to the grinder, the surrounding shell outside that snaps off. The carafe isn't easy to clean either because its difficult to get the lid off. (2)I don't think the quality of brewing is very good either. It's decent...but by no means the best."
1,Never even got to use it,"I recieved this machine from our online Wedding registry and to our suprise it would not even come on when we plugged it in. We then decided to return it to our local store thinking it was just a fluke. I happily brought the new machine home, and when I opened the box it had a strong smell of coffee. Sure enough there was water still in the machine and uncleaned coffee grounds. I could not believe that target would put returned/used products back on the shelf. There is a reason why people keep returning these machines. To our dismay the features that are on the machine were what we were seeking, and Target does not even sell one similair product.Very disappointed in Texas"
3,"Melita Mill and Brew - the good, the bad and the dysfunctional","This is our 5th Mill and Brew Coffee maker in 3 years. Why do we keep buying it? Well, it is the only mill and brew pot that has a coffee basket large enough for the coffee strength that we enjoy. It is also more compact than many other models.Whats bad? The motor for the mill does not last very long. Also, plastic fittings and a glass pot.What's dysfunctional AND the reason for 5 pots? The little latch for the milling section is made out of plastic and consistantly breaks between 3 and 9 months (always outside of the manufacture warranty) None of the brewing functions work without this latch - you can get around it by putting a rock or other heavy object over the milling section.Do we think it's intentional? You betcha!"
2,Okay...but gave out after less than a year,"We used the product, admittedly almost daily, for about 10 months before the top latch broke (you now have to hold it down to operate the grinder), but that wasn't the only problem. The 'pause and serve' simply doesn't work, the narrow basket is very hard to clean (and clean....and clean...and clean) and there should be some way to use a paper filter on the days you already have ground coffee. We're upgrading to the Capresso..."
2,Crunchy coffee!,"Melitta Mill & Brew Coffee Maker works well and is easy to clean but it does have some problems. You will typically use more coffee than you'd think to get a good cup. If you lose power for an instant, you have to reset the clock. The auto-shutoff is only an hour. But the biggest problem is that coffee grinds end up in the pot. This problem was negligible when I first got it but now I'm getting a lot of grinds and the coffee is almost undrinkable. I've only had it for 6 months and only used it about 50 times. Melitta said to buy another grinder but that's...for 50 more pots of coffee. A bit expensive.I liked this model because it is small and didn't appear as cumbersome as most of the grind and brew models are. It does pour a lot better than my old coffee pot; quicker with no spilling."
2,Nice when it worked!,"First the lid latch covering the coffee bean container broke, requiring us to have to place a heavy object on top of the lid for the unit to operate. Then today the unit simply failed to brew the coffee. The grinder worked okay, and then... nothing! It WAS very convenient to be able to put the beans and water in the night before and have it grind and brew automatically at our predetermined time the next morning...when it worked. However with first the lid breaking, and now the unit not brewing coffee at all this thing doesn't deserve more than two stars. Perhaps I should give it 4 stars for when it worked and 1 star now. Save your money and buy a more reliable unit from another company."
3,Weak Cold Coffee,"I read all the reviews here on Amazon and thought this was the coffeemaker to buy. Most of all I wanted a coffeemaker that had a brewing tempature of 195 to 205. This is needed to fully extract all the oils and flavor from the bean. I was disappointed when the pot arrived and I brewed the first cup. The coffee was tepid at best. I knew the brewing temp was too low. I then checked the water coming out of the brewer and it was only 175 degrees. I have to microwave every cup to get hot enough to drink. The coffee is also very weak and I have to add extra beans to get any flavor. One trick I did find is to wait for the beans to grind and stop the brewer. Then I remove the brew basket and shake it to get all the grinds to go to the bottom of the basket. This seemed to make the coffee stronger. Oh well, back to the search for a hot coffeemaker"
3,San Francisco Bay Area coffee drinkers take note!,"Makes great coffee, but here's what I have to add to the comments of others: The official guidance (terrible instruction manual, by the way) says (a) don't put in more than 8 scoops of beans and (b) use 1 scoop of beans for every two 5-oz. ""cups"" of coffee. Other reviewers have already said that this is too weak; they double it: 1 scoop per cup. (Now we're down to 8 cups capacity, rather than 10.) I favor stronger coffee (e.g., the way Peets brews theirs in the SF Bay Area), so I've found that 2 or 2.33 scoops per cup is just right. However, with the eight-scoop limit, you can make a maximum of 3.4 to 4 ""cups,"" which is more like two mugs' worth! So, if you like strong coffee, this is great for making enough for yourself and possibly your sweetie, too, in the morning, but certainly not for a larger group, as the ""10-cup coffeemaker"" might suggest."
3,It's ok,"yeah...just ok. I bought it after my cuisinart grind and brew went Tango Uniform. The Melitta has some nice features. I think it is easier to clean than the Cuisinart, the coffee tastes nice...but it doesn't stay on long enough...nor can you adjust the temperature control like you can on the Cuisinart. It is slightly smaller, not quite as loud...but I drink coffee all day...this one doesn't keep up.If I had to do it again, I'd have bought another Cuisinart. My suggestion is to kick in the extra money...especially if you are like me and drink coffee like it is a moral imperitive. This one is good for the one pot a day, casual coffee drinker."
3,"Good-looking, space-saving, convenient. Bad coffee.","I'll make it brief. The coffeemaker has gone back to Amazon (which is, as usual, great with returns). I've been strongly disapponted in the quality of coffee. Yes, mill and brew, timer, small size, cleanability are all there. The good coffee isn't. I guess it has to do with the water temperature, a common problem of this type of coffeemakers. You'll be much better off with a good coffeemaker and pre-milled beans than with this 2-in-1 which doesn't do a good job with either."
5,just what i was looking for,"My husband sells coffee,and we grind beans, plus use already ground beans and this machines does both perfectly. I spent quite a few hours looking for this type of machine, and was very glad to find something that really does work. Great buy!"
5,Make this again,"This was the best coffee maker we've ever owned. I wish they would make it again! Ground the beans, brewed the coffee and easy to clean."
3,Disapointing,My biggest complaint about this product is that it produces only lukewarm cups of coffee. We stopped using this product as a result.I wish that I had returned it during the refund time period.
3,It's not bad for the money,"We are about to replace this for the second time but we'll go with another brand this time. While the machine makes a good cup of coffee, is fairly quiet, and easy to clean, it's not a study machine.The machine is all plastic. On our first one, the plastic catch for the coffee basket broke in 6 months. The lid couldn't be snapped closed so the machine wouldn't grind. We limped along by taping it down but after 2 years, the plastic grinder fitting that fits into the coffee basket shattered.We replaced that one with another of the same, thinking we just had a defective machine. After about 18 months, the plastic grinder fitting into the coffee basket is breaking. The plastic part has wedges and after time, the wedges round off.We make perhaps 2 pots a day, on average and so don't think we are heavy users of the machine. This time, we're going with another brand."
3,Good coffee maker - no way to replace parts,"I bought the previous model (with a stainless steel carafe) a couple of years ago. It's easy to clean, works great, and produces good coffee. The temperature could be a bit higher, but for performance it's a winner.Unfortunately, this morning a small chunk of the plastic latch broke off. Although this coffee maker breaks down into lots of little parts, there are no replacement parts available - so what's the point of it breaking down? I can still make coffee, but have to put a weight on the mill lid to engage the mechanism. This is probably what I'll do until I can a) replace the machine or b) figure out a way to do a more sightly workaround.I'm a little reluctant to repurchase the same model, especially since the stainless carafe isn't offered. I would hope that the carafe I have would fit, but hate to assume. Also, now that it's broken I'm evaluating if I want to spend this amount of money - a little pricey - for another couple years of use."
4,Melitta mill and brew,One of the best coffee makers out there. A couple parts wore out on my old one (same model) after 5 years so this is another to replace it. Almost identical except LEDs are brighter and keypad is slightly different.
4,Replacement Lid!,Love the machine..but the lid broke. Seems like a common problem. Called 1800 233-9054 and ordered a replacement latching lid. Told them I had it for a year and they sent out the new lid free of charge.
3,Great Coffee from a Great Coffee Maker with One Design Flaw,"This is our favorite coffee maker. We are about to get our third one. That is why three stars. The first two broke in the same place. The plastic part which holds the lid covering the brew basket down has broken (the machine will not work unless the lid is fully closed). Melitta was very good the first time and replaced our pot without charge (six months after purchase). It has been about 18 months this time and we'll see what they do.In truth, it is such a good coffee maker that we'll probably buy another if they do not replace this one. Even so, this design flaw is very annoying."
1,Poor Product,We owned this coffee maker for less than a year and it was used daily. The coffee never seemed hot enough and the latch on the grinder lid broke making the machine non-functional. The filter basket is pretty difficult to clean each day since coffee grounds tend to stick in the bottom under the grinder blade.I replaced the unit with a Braun and I am much happier but do not have the built in grinder capability. I understand Cuisinart has a built in grinder which is separate from the filter but it still seems to require a lot of effort to clean and use daily.
4,Good coffee at a good price,We've been very happy with this product. It makes very good coffee and the grinding/programming functions are easy to understand and use. Couple that with the fact that it sells for slightly more than half the price of the comparable competitive models and you have a great deal.
4,Only One Small Complaint,"We had a Cuisinart Grind and Brew and broke it within 2 years, as we do every other coffee pot that we have owned. I wasn't sure about another grinding and brewing machine, but then I found this one. I agree with others that the Cuisinart was a pain to clean, and that this one is much easier. The two pieces that you clean just snap right back in. I never have to fight with them.After 1.5 months, I love this machine. I have lovely coffee in the morning and its held up well to our harsh treatment of coffeemakers. I have only one small complaint about this pot: it turns itself off after only 1 hour and there is no way to set the time longer. With my husband getting up in the morning 1.5 hours after I do, I would like for him to not have to warm his coffee if I turn on the machine too early."
5,Best Coffeemaker EVER !!!!,"As far as I am concerned this is the best cofeemaker ever. Throw in some beans, add water and enjoy... I purchased a second one just to keep around in case they ever stop making them. I buy them for all my friends and family. No home is complete without one. It's super easy to use and even easier to clean. Only thing missing is that it won't grow the beans for you. I highly recommend it."
2,Housing could be better,"I've had the Grind and Brew for over a year. Naturally, the warranty is for 1 year. Last week, a small plastic 'nub' broke off the filter housing top preventing the top from staying closed. Now the grinder will not work unless you hold the top down manually - a real pain. Also, the machine shuts off immediately after brewing is complete, I assume because without the little plastic nub, the top doesn't close and the cycle is interrupted. It's a shame because it makes good coffee. From now on I'll stick to a basic drip pot and grind my own coffee in a coffee mill."
1,Don't buy this coffeemaker,"We always try to buy quality products and we usually find that we have made a quality purchase. Not this time, though. We bought this pot while we had company and the box got thrown out before we tried the coffeemaker. What a mistake!! When you try to pour a cup of coffee, the pot leaks down the sides of the pot and all over the counter from the area where the plastic part of the pot joins the metal part. Can't find a replacement pot to buy anywhere!!! The grinder does not make consistent size grinds and most times it grinds so fine that the coffee goes through the filter and coats everything like sludge... even puts grounds in the coffee pot. Doesn't matter when setting you put the grinder on. Almost all the same. The coffee cools off right away. The very messy filter is not easy to clean and takes several minutes to rinse or wash and then you also have to wipe the sludge out of the grinding area. Ugh! What a waste of good money!!!! I would give ZERO stars if possible."
4,Great Little Machine,"I spent a lot of time researching coffee makers before I decided to purchase this one. I have not been disappointed! This little workhorse is my favorite new addition to my kitchen. I can't believe I waited this long to get a grinder/brewer in one - definitely helps with the counter clutter. I will confirm what other reviewers have said, which is that you need more beans than is specified. As a southpaw (left handed), it's a bit of a drag that you have to pour the water in on the right into a rather small opening (and there's a drainhole in the back that I don't like; if you pour a full carafe of water into the coffeemaker it spills out onto your counter), but other than that I love it. Great, great little machine, especially for the price!"
5,Buying my second one,"I have had this machine for several years, after pitching a Cuisinart Brew & Grind, which was very difficult to clean and manuever.I am ready to buy my second identical machine after searching long and hard to find something comparable and as user friendly as this one. I broke the latch on the top and have placed a heavy object on it to keep it closed. It works like a charm. However, I recently purchased a replacement filter basket and a broke the carafe.Instead of ordering a new carafe, I am ordering an identical machine, since I already have a replacement filter/grinder for $14.95 for the new machine. I am only doing this because my main unit has a broken latch.I would recommend this machine to anyone who enjoys freshly brewed coffee and likes easy cleanup."
2,Watch out!,"We have had 2 of these (dumb, I know), and each time, the lid fails to lock and will not work unless you hold or weigh the lid. This is most inconvenient! The coffee maker works well for about 9-12 months, then the lid fails. The coffee maker is good in every other respect."
2,...coffee maker lasted a year.,"I've only had this coffeemaker 1 year and it stopped working. The on switch no longer functions. I don't even drink coffee in the summer which makes the machine less used than most. I cannot recommend this machine if you are a serious coffee drinker. If you buy this machine, following the directions is a must! Also, the coarse grind of this machine is not coarse enough. I always felt as though the machine grounded the beans too fine even or the lowest setting of 1. The coffee that it brewed was never hot enough, and would get cool quickly after pouring into a cup. Also, you have only 1 hour to drink your coffee before the machine turns itself off. I liked the machine because of the convience of having freshly grounded and brewed coffee in the morning but it's just not worth it, if it only last's a year."
3,they don't warn you .....,I ordered my coffee maker about 10 months ago. I loved the coffee and the convenience.About three weeks ago I began to notice that the beans were not grinding.I called a kitchen store that carries higher end coffee makers. She asked if I had been using frozen beans. They apparently ruinthe blades of the grinder. She said the Capresso warns against it. I went back and read the manual again and there was no such warning. Capresso here I come!
5,Mellitta Mill and Brew Best Coffee Maker,"This is the fourth Mellitta Mill and Brew I have owned, I use the heck out of them. This is by far the best coffee maker around, with the ability to grind your own or use pre ground it does not get any better. Simple set up and use features as well as super simple cleaning. The other coffee makers should take note of the simplicity of the Mellitta Mill and Brew, other brands are more expensive, more complicated and make a poor quality coffee. As long as Mellitta keeps making this, I will keep buying. Great Product, Great Price. Five Star all the way."
4,good product,I've been a Melitta fan since the 6o's. This is my second Mill & Brew. The first one is wearing out- after at least five years of use. My one complaint is that the coffee isn't quite hot enough but I'm hoping that they've addressed this by now. Pete's Major Dickason's blend and a Mill & Brew... What more does one need?? (Actually- Al Pete used one piece Chemex pots in his joint in Berkeley back in the 60's- too many steps for me at this point in my life.)
4,Very Nice,"I got this coffeemaker for Christmas and use it twice a day. I really like it. I like the ability to choose either grounds or beans and I like the way it looks. The only thing that is a little troublesome is cleaning the filter. It has so many ""nooks and crannies"" that it is hard to just rinse out. So far I have had NO trouble with the lid, but I am very careful after reading the other reviews. All in all, it is a great buy for the bucks."
5,BEST COFFEEMAKER EVER,"I love it. An integrated grinder that ACTUALLY WORKS! Wonderful. Just be careful with the top lid (I can see how it might break if handled roughly) and it'll be fine.Hint: when closing the top, be VERY gentle. If it doesn't close easily, take out the basket, manually spin the knob on the bottom a few times, re-insert, and try again. If you stick to this procedure it'll last a very, very long time and you'll avoid the only problem with this otherwise-spectacular product."
4,Melitta Coffeemaker,"After a month of reviewing coffee makers and reading reviews I purchased this one. It is easy to use and easy to clean. After dealing with the Cuisinart for years, this is a breeze. The only problem is that my husband and I can not get the automatic timer to work."
3,Coffeemaker,"The coffeemaker is as advertised.It is nice to have freshly ground coffee.We were surprised in that you really only get 5 mugs of coffee (1 cup turns out to be really 1/2 cup).It is a bit clumsy to clean the filter, and it looks like it would be easy to snap off the tabs on the top - could be more robust.We were also disappointed that the warmer shuts off after an hour - guess this is a safety feature, but left us with cold coffee a couple of times."
1,Poor lid design has broken twice,"I bought the Mill and Brew a couple of years ago. The hook on the lid for the bean hopper is very fragile. First one broke within a couple of months, I returned for a replacement unit. Second one broke just last week, no way I'm gonna be able to return an appliance that is a couple of years old. Now I have to place a heavy wight on the lid when I want to brew a pot.To bad, this unit brews (and grinds) a good pot of coffee.EDIT: I just read through about a hundred of the 250+ reviews for this unit and found that the broken lid is a very common complaint. Be aware that this Melitta grind/brew unit will likely break if you choose to purchase it!"
2,"Very good features, yucky taste","I was happy with the features and function of the Melitta. The coffee I made for myself was fine (I prefer a strong brew). The coffee I made for my fiance, who prefers a weaker brew, had a strong flavor and smell of plastic. I think my stronger brew masked the plastic flavor. Twice we tried the vinegar solution cleaning cycle prescribed in the manual, but the plastic flavor remained. My fiance understandably didn't like the plastic taste, and neither of us liked the idea of putting unwelcome chemicals into our bodies. We returned it. Ours was black, by the way, which I suppose could affect the flavor if the odd taste was something leaching out of the plastic. Since this is a mill-and-brew, the hot liquids travel across more plastic than in most coffeemakers. Melitta should find a more chemically inert plastic or stainless for the parts that contact hot liquid."
3,"Fabulous, except that we had to send it back","We were very excited about this machine - great price, good design, built-in mill...but after we got it home and did the first two plain-water brews through the system, the water still smelled intensely of plastic. So we did a few more plain water brews. Still plastic - and yes, we tried tasting it, and it tasted awful. So we tried running vinegar through, then some coffee (thinking the oils might help)... still plastic. We tried some soapy water, plain water a few more times, vinegar again, coffee again... the plastic smell and flavor did decrease a bit over time but it was still distinct when brewing plain water and it made the coffee taste really wrong.In the end, we sent it back. Probably we just had bad luck and got a lemon, but we weren't willing to risk going through the whole process again - we bought a less exciting Mr. Coffee machine from a local store and it makes good coffee after just two plain water brews."
1,Melitta,"Melitta has always been a quality item so I purchased the coffee maker. I have to say that this is absolutely the worst coffee maker. I followed all the directions before preparation. The coffee was only warm, not hot and it didn't stay hot. I'll take my Cuisinart Grind and Brew any time."
2,Owned for 2 years,"We've had this coffee maker for 2 years now. The coffee was always supurb! However, I found the grinder to be a bit loud. The main problem we have now is that after 2 years of using it daily, the latch that holds the grinder cover closed has broken. From an engineering perspective, the problem is caused by the plastic warping and the stress of the grinder vibration. Today, I'm in the market for a new coffee maker, but I will not purchase the Melita brand."
2,Okay Machine! but it doesn't make a good cup of coffee!!!,This machine is very convenience and easy to clean BUT it DOESN'T make a good cup of coffee because the water ran through the bean to quick.
1,melita grind and brew,"Melitta MEMB1B Mill & Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker, BlackThis product worked fine until I tried to program it for a delayed start.It not only would not program but now it will not come on at all. I have no idea what to do about this problem"
3,You will either like the concept or hate it,"I loved the illustrations, but the story was somewhat unsettling to me as an adult. I am concern about poaching of animals for their ivory and found the tooth fairy using the childs teeth for piano keys, just as unsettling(even though the child lived). But if the story does not bother you, you will find that the illustrations live up the the quality, detail and class that you associate with this 'writer'."
2,Wing Chun?,"This only resembles Wing Chun at the rudimentary blocking level. Sifu Wong does not explain nor show the Wing Chun philosophy in simultaneous blocking and punching. Also he uses an uncharacteristic style of many kicks.Wing Chun was originally founded by a woman, thus the hard blocks demonstrated are not the Wing Chun I've been taught. However, there is some value in the video for basic self defense. Is it a good DVD on Wing Chun... No, not even close. Does it show why Wing Chun is typically faster and has gained popularity... again the answer is No."
1,Totally Unhappy with this Fryer,"This was my first deep fryer purchase. I was always nervous about frying on the stove because there was no way to regulate the temperature of the oil. I always ended up with soggy, greasy food. This product looked like a great deal,had a regulated temperature control, and a cover to protect against spattering. The problem is that I once again ended up with totally greasy food. I read everything I could find about deep frying and determined that high temperature was a key ingredianet to light and crispy fried food. I suspected that the oil wasn't getting hot enough so I purchased a candy thermometer. What do you know, the oil was always 25 to 30 degrees below what the temperature control indicated. I returned the device promptly and got a decent fryer....don't wast your money on this bulky and ineffient product."
5,An Awesome Book about Faith and Healing,"Dr. Price helped me get back to the basic principle of divine healing -- focusing on the healer (Jesus) rather than the healing. His view that faith cannot be generated by humans, rather it is given by God, revolutionized my thinking. This idea takes away much of the worry and stress about stepping out on one's own human effort; rather we are only successful when we act under a complete dependance on Jesus, the healer. If you are hitting a wall when seeking for healing, this book is a must read."
1,The Joy,Not very pleased at all played one day saved had a good team next day data corruption and now I can't seem to save any progress... so in all it crapped out after my first five hours or less of play.
2,I was displeased....,"took way too long to get here and when it did i was so excited i got all the way to the elite four (after i transfered my pokemon from sapphire, including two shinys i got in a ligit way) i beat the elite four saved it. the next day i turn it on and it says data coruppted and all my data was GONE i was mad for days...... dont buy.... seriously"
2,counterfeit,"Bought this game for my grandson. Immediately upon receiving, he stated that it was a counterfeit. Then he showed me a web site on-line which reviews different games and sure enough, all the characteristics that make it a counterfeit were there. He still is playing the game but said something about not being able to do some of the things with the game that can be done with the genuine game."
1,Don't buy GBA games from this dealer.,All of the ones I've received from here are fakes. I was hoping to get the real thing if I was going to pay so much.
5,Pokemon Emerald Rules!,I ride the school bus to school and a friend of mine brings his Game Boy Advance SP with him on the bus. One day he was playing Pokemon Emerald Version. He told me it was a great game. So one day I went to Best Buy because my sister was looking for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang on DVD and I happened to come over to the Game Boy section of the store and found it on sale. My dad told me I could buy it. So I did and now I am so hooked to it!
1,game is defective,"I received the game on time but the save feature on the game itself has been corrupted or damage before I got, so it doesn't work properly. i haven't played it since"
3,Same game as all the others,Same all all the other game new missions and a few new pokemon to get but basicly the same. My boys love it but I find it boring.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!,"I purchased the Game Boy Advance Pokemon Sapphire, Emerald & Ruby for my son's birthday. He wanted these games so he could migrate the Pokemon to his DS Pokemon Diamond game, but these games would not allow him to migrate the Pokemon. Every time he tried to migrate the Pokemon to his Diamond game, it would delete his file and he would have to start all over again. I know that his DS and his Pokemon Diamond game are not defective because his cousin has the Game Boy Advance Pokemon Emerald game and he doesn't have any trouble migrating Pokemon from his cousin's game. He found the disfunctional games to be rather frustrating. I returned all 3 games by USPS with signature confirmation. Y Yang signed for the package a week ago and I still have not received a refund for the games."
2,POKEMON EMERALD FOR DS,"NOT REALLY SURE HOW GOOD GAME IS. WHEN I PLAYED THIS GAME IT HAD A VIRUS AND I COULDN""T GET REIMBURSED THROUGH SELLER OR GET EXCHANGE. AND AMAZON WOULDN'T STAND BEHIND IT EITHER."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE,"DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE! They are LIARS, they sell BOOTLEG COPIES OF THE GAMES and are NOT TO BE TRUSTED!! Call the police on them for selling bootleg games. Call Nintendo and report these people NOW!!"
1,Never received product.,"As of today, July 31, 2008, I have yet to receive this product. USPS claims they delivered it on July 3, 2008, however, no one in household signed for the package. Currently having to complete a claim for this order. Would love to offer more, but unable to at this time."
4,Pokemon Emerald,"I love pokemon. Great game. Alot of fun and very addicting. I just wish they would make a game like this for the bigger systems. One that you can actually go and catch pokemon like on the TV show. Until they get smart enough to do that, I will continue to have fun with what they have out."
2,doesn't save,this was a gift and it was disappointing to the kid b/c it doesn't save and that seems to be the only reason a kid would want to play this game. Also there is no way to return the product apparently.
4,defective game,"1. The game was used (there was a player profile when started) although the seller claimed it was new. That was not the major problem (see 2).2. After my kid progressed further into the game (Battle Frontier), she found that the ""rest"" function did not work. It could not save the game progress. Later on, another try to save the progress caused the complete deletion of the saved game. It was maddening.3. The seller was quick to refund the full cost."
5,pokemon emerald is very awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,pokemon emerald is very fun.You can get crazy playing this game.sometimes it hard to win the game.you will be hooked onto the two on two battle.GET THIS GAME IT's THE BEST POKEMON GAME EVER.
4,pokemon emerald - used,"The game was received in the condition as advertised. All of the options worked and there were some extra characters enabled in the game. The cartridge was not a ""copy"" from what I can tell. The label was missing but that was called out in the description. This game is hard to find locally so I was happy to see it on Amazon."
3,Could Be Improved,I would want to know which Pokemon to start out with because I might not have the best ones for the game. I would also want to know if I could capture good Pokemons or else I would not want the game. The way the characters look could be better. They could be bigger. I would also like to be able to choose how to make my character.
2,the best pokemon game,"i think that pokemon emerald is an exellent game because you get to catch pokemon , breed them,level up pokemon and even envolve them to different evolutions.it is a cool adventure game that brings mysteires to solve like(how to get mew,ho-ho,lugia.etc)it also has new islands,better grafics.for me it is a exellent game to play.pokemon emerald even has pre-evolution and evlution pokemon that you do not get on leafgreen and firered they are (pre-evolution of snorlax,evolution of sneasel,pre-evolution of sudowoodo these are all i know for now.it for me is the best pokemon game"
2,didn't even work,"It would lag up, freeze up, and restart everytime seeing a tentacool. I cant even trade or migrate with other games."
4,THE BEST GAME.,"This is the best game ever with every turn somthing happens you should buy it one tip don,t use mudcip use treeco he,s good because the first gmy leader is rock type."
1,Didn't work,We bought this game as a holiday gift for my son. It didn't work and he was disappointed. Bought it for $50 because it was suppose to be tested to work properly and like new.
5,Emerald Is The best game since gold!,"This is the best game yet. you can catch rayquaza,kyrouge,groundon and all the regis. you can trade with firered or leafgreen. I've beaten this game.It is harder than ruby or saphire."
5,New from Pokemon!,"I've played Pokemon sice Red and Blue came out. Like Cryistal Pokemon move but, it moves during the whole battle! You are not on team Magam or the other team. You work ALONE(most of the time)!!!!! So what, I know you can take it! It's the coolest Pokemon game ever!"
1,Erases Saves,"I bought the game, and when I put it in, it gave me a message saying that ""The game can be played."" I played it for awhile, and it saved a few times, but a few days later, I turned it on and it told me that ""The save file has corrupted, the game can be played."" and erased my save."
3,"Review for pokemon red vers- wait, pokemon Emerald?","Oh! its another damn pokemon game. This game is a fun RPG, but i only know about 240 pokemon, and there is now a ridiculous amount to deal with. YUCK! also there is just not enough change from ALL of the previous games. i would get fire of leaf."
1,waste of time,What is the point of this game? it's almost exactly like ruby and saphire. It has a dumb battle frontier which is as different as my left foot from the ruby/saphire's battle tower. somehow these games are popular. Each one is like a remake of the previous series of poke'mon. I think that the new extras in this game are borderline pointless. the first pokemon blue and red were fun but these aren't
1,This game STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is soooooo boring. It was a waist of money, they should have never made this game!"
1,Buy new if possible... please.,"I bought a used game and it deleted my progress. I found out it was a bootleg game. I got a refund and ordered another. This one took over 2 weeks to arrive. This was also a bootleg. While I love this game, I am very angry. I advise everyone else to use extreme caution when ordering used Pokemon games and order them new if possible. This is not the quality I've come to expect from Amazon."
1,PYRATED!,"I was very excited to get a Pokemon emerald version in the mail.When it arrived,it looked a little different than I remembered,I made the mistake of discarding this feature,and played the game happily.I then proceded the invest over 70 hours in the game,and beat the elite four.I turned my game off and back on,and was suprised to see that my saved file was erased.I later learned that I had recived a pyrated copy.I was skeptile about this at first,until I saw the customer pictures,and saw the example of the ""FAKE"" copy,looked at mine...EXACT MATCH!Be careful wich one you buy.I am very mad,and will have to drop another 30 or so bucks to get an ""official"" copy."
1,No saving,"When the game arrived, I was excited that it had arrived early. This quickly turned turned to irritation when I found that the battery that allowed the ability to save was dead. I was, to say disappointed, was an understatement. I payed extra money for a game that I was assured by amazon would work properly. This may be that last time I trust used produces off this site."
5,best game idk if it works,idk i luv it but i hasnt came yet i contacted seller he siad it saved ect. luv all old pokemon games
2,Not compatible with ds pokemon games,This game would not migrate to other Pokemon games. Previous owner some how added a glitch that kept it from saving for migration with other DS games.
1,Didn't work,Took forever to come in and once I tried to actually use it I couldn't save any files because the game was ruined.
5,The best Pokémon game for the Gameboy Advance.,"This Pokémon game is undoubtedly the best of the GBA Pokémon games. Not only are there asthetic changes, the changes to the core system make the game that much more rewarding. The nature of every Pokémon is now a factor in battle, affecting their statistics in unique ways. Animation, a new feature, is done with a scant 2 frames, but it injects much more personality into Emerald than the games that came before it could ever have. Connecting to friends is also rewarding, with several features that are directly influenced by your friends. Again, this is a great game to get if you have a DS or a GBA."
1,LOVED THE GAME BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT IT WAS A FAKE!,GAME WAS GREAT BEAT THE WHOLE THING! THEN TURNED IT ON AFTER THAT AND THE FILE WAS CORRUPTED! THE PEOPLE SELLING THESE GAMES SHOULD BE BETTER AWARE OF THE PRODUCT THERE SELLING! IF ANYONE KNOW WHERE I CAN GET A REAL COPY PLEASE LET ME KNOW! THANKS!
1,Pokemon Emerald Version - Was Cracked,This game was cracked and was useless. We threw it away and purchased new. Since it was cracked you could not play the full game. I would never again purchase from this buyer.
1,Beware of FAKES!!,"I bought this game thinking it was simply a used game that the 'original' buyer no longer wanted. When I received it, the game was a fake! It was an illegal fake game made to look like the real game. If you are buying this game for 'used' or for really cheap, beware as it might be a fake."
1,HACKED,"Amazon sold me a hacked game, and now I can't so anything about it. Useless now, thanks for stealing my money."
2,Don't buy unless you really like pokemon!!,This game is fun in Little Root ( where you start) Then after you beat the 6th gym leader you get stuck! But if you really like pokemon you will know how to get past. The older pokemon games are much better! If you are going to buy one get Ruby or Fire Red.
5,Pokemon Emerald,You may not think that there is much feutures in pokemon emerald untill you have beaten the elite 4. There is a new area called the battle frontier... You can get both groudon and kyogre in the game and there is lots of new places and new things to do. I have pokemon sapphire and I do not think this game was a waste of money.
4,"Game is fun, but beware!","My kids love this game, however please be aware when you buy from a seller on Amazon. I received 2 different counterfeit games ~ Amazon has great customer service and I did get refunds however the sellers were not suspended. Only buy this game from Amazon direct so you can be sure you are getting the real deal!!"
5,authentic game. finally!,"The game was as expected. This wa a replacement for my kids original game that went missing. many fakes ate out there, but this one was REAL! Thanks.a+ seller!"
3,I am unsure.,"I loved the game, but at the end it reset my progress to nothing, I am disappointed but it is very fun."
4,baby buy buy buy,Neat the graphics are amazing the new batle arens are very cool.Here's a hint : do NOT leave the team aqua base until you find the hiden master ball.P.S don't start with treeco he looks ugly when he evolves.
1,pokemon game,"Pokemon emerald game does not save. Sender said it saves, but instead erases when it saves. So didn't enjoy game."
3,Don't waste your money if you have Ruby/Sapphire,"Okay, it's fun. Can't deny that. And yes, there are a few new features. However, unfortunely it's mostly the same old Ruby/Sapphire game recycled. If this were a PC game, they would have released it as an add-on to the original for half the price, not as a whole new game.Save you money and wait for the next series to begin instead."
1,Issues for game Pokemon Emerald,Although the pricing was good and the shippingFast ; we need the store that sold us the gameTo contact us about returning the game. AnError keeps coming up and erases all playedGames this product game is not working wellAt all. We want an exchange
5,Pokemon Emerald Version,"The product was in great shape, and enjoyed by the person who received it. It was shipped in a timely manner."
4,"A new addition, with the old feeling of the beginning games","Another addition to the well known series. The game has the same mechanics as the ones in the beginning, with some new additions that make the game fun and interesting. The game is generic in some ways, but at the same time well bring new forms of catching, raising, and trading pokemon with the game to achieve a full pokedex and high level pokemon. All together, the game is good in its own form and well appeal to teenagers and younger, as well as young adults."
2,"Good, but says my file is corrupted sometimes (erases all my saved data!)","It was good for the first few months, then it started to fail on me by not keeping the save."
4,Pokemon Emerald Version,The Pokemon Emerald Version is a fun game. It is great to add Polemon to your Diamond or Pearl Pokemon. Everything went smooth in the transaction. I would buy from this person again.
5,Great Game!,"Pokemon Emerald is an RPG (Role Playing Game) for the Game Boy Advance. Even though Pokemon Emerald is like an exact copy of Pokemon games Ruby and Sapphire, there are still some exclusives to the game. Like the chance to go to the Battle Frontier, and catch all Hoenn Pokemon. Pokemon Trainers also have different Pokemon and different levels. Pokemon Emerald allows you to capture Kyogre, Groudon, and Rayquaza.The Pokemon Company, Game Freak, and Nintendo have designed Emerald differently from Sapphire and Ruby, and the main Pokemon trainers look much different. Pokemon Emerald is definitely a great game to buy!"
2,Not that good,"I am very disappointed with this tea. It says green tea, but doesn't taste like green tea. I think the white tea overwhelmed the green tea. Tastes like sweetened water with some lemon flavor. Also says it contains caffeine, doesn't say how much, can't feel any of the caffeine."
1,Horrible taste and lack of Ginseng,I can't taste green tea nor ginseng in this tea bag. I would recommend Lipton Honey Lemon Ginseng to someone who enjoy green tea and ginseng flavor and extra boost of energy. Stay away from this product! I would not buying this product again.
5,My favorite green tea,I love this flavor! I don't usually like the taste of green tea but I can drink this one without any sugar or sweetener. YUM
5,Gregory Solomons- Radiologist (Australia),"The best single volume diagnostic Ultrasound textbook available.It is a 1998 book so probably time for a new edition.....but really how much has changed? The core info is still the same.I recommend it for residents/registrars,and also for consultants wanting an approachable comprehensive text.It is very well written and illustrated."
1,A disappointment right out of the box!,"Great price but it doesn't work! After mounting this alternator I wondered why the battery continually discharged overnight. I finally discovered, after disconnecting the battery ground one evening and checking battery status next mornng, and checking wiring and connections, that the new alternator is the problem! I'm trying now to get a replacement and waiting to hear from Amazon."
4,Simple Solutions for Better /SafetySecurity,"This book is excellent in that it not only covers tips for being protected from would-be stalkers and harrassers, but it offers many tips on general security for home, office and car. Also enjoyed the relationship tips from a man's perspective and the statistics on how much harrassment stems from bad relationships. Definitely recommend!"
